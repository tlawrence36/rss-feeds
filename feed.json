      "With an estimated price of $40 million to $60 million, \u201cEl sue\u00f1o (La cama)\u201d \u2013 in English, \u201cThe Dream (The Bed)\u201d \u2014 may surpass the top price for a work by any female artist when it goes under the hammer.

      "Kahlo vibrantly and unsparingly depicted herself and events from her life, which was upended by a bus accident at 18. She started to paint while bedridden, underwent a series of painful surgeries on her damaged spine and pelvis, then wore casts until her death in 1954 at age 47.",

      "Natalie Paine is a French horn player in New Zealand\u2019s navy who since October has been among 21 military members stationed in Antarctica. There, her melodies drift across the frozen Ross Sea from perhaps the most remote practice room on Earth.",

      "Her dream was revived but enacting it wasn\u2019t simple. It took four years of unsuccessful applications before Paine landed a posting as a communications operator.",
      "It\u2019s a consuming job, worked in six-day stretches that leave little time for music. Paine monitors radio, phone, email and other communications traffic at New Zealand\u2019s mission at Scott Base, sometimes speaking to people on the ice who haven\u2019t heard other voices for weeks.",
      "In whatever window she can find, Paine squeezes in scales and mouth exercises, going to great lengths not to disturb others on round-the-clock shifts. That means slipping out of the main base to a hut built in 1957 under the leadership of explorer Sir Edmund Hillary as New Zealand established its presence in Antarctica.",
      "While she plays by the window, watching seals on the ice, Paine finds new musical motifs bubbling up.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Lidia Bastianich grew up in a small town in Italy where neighbors were like extended family. If kids came home from school and mom was out, they went to the neighbors for a snack. If someone had a problem with a sibling, they went next door.",
      "The Emmy Award-winning TV host, author and restaurateur remembers her grandmother making an extra pot for lunch and sending young Lidia next door with it to feed her blind, elderly neighbor, along with a glass of wine.",
      "That sense of community is not specific to Italy, of course. \u201cIt exists in America in smaller situations, but we need to nurture that ever more,\u201d Bastianich says.",
      "She's hoping to spotlight and cultivate togetherness with her 14th TV special, \u201cLidia Celebrates America: A Nation of Neighbors,\u201d which premieres Nov. 25 on PBS and streams on PBS.org.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my way of really thanking America. I think that there\u2019s no better place in the whole world than the United States of America and somehow it\u2019s been maligned,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat I know is that out there, in the midst of America, there\u2019s a lot of good American people.\u201d",
      "Bastianich travels to wildfire-scarred neighborhoods outside Los Angeles, a pay-how-you-can caf\u00e9 in Denver, a Japanese-American community center in Portland, Oregon, and a first-of-its-kind free grocery market in San Francisco. At every stop, there are hands reaching out to help.",
      "\u201cThat connection makes you feel good, it makes you feel more of a human being. And it gives you back that kind of desire to live on positively,\u201d she says.",
      "The hourlong special starts in Altadena, California, hurting from the recent wildfires. Bastianich joins volunteers making 175 five-course meals that are delivered to victims. One of the volunteers is someone himself living out of his car because the flames had made him homeless.",
      "\u201cI got the shivers. I just needed to hug him,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI know that he needed that. I know he was in his car by himself, and yet he found it within him to give. That takes fortitude. It takes character.\"",
      "She also meets self-taught cook Kiki Ruff in Porter County, Indiana. Ruff hosts a viral TikTok series that helps families struggling with food insecurity stretch their groceries, using recipes from the Depression, recessions and wartime.",

She was born in 1947 in Istria, an Italian territory ceded to Yugoslavia after World War II. She spent the first years of her life under communist rule, then fled with her family across the border to Italy. There, they lived in a refugee camp for two years until an aid organization helped bring them to New York in 1958.",
      "Bastianich's last stop is in San Francisco, home of the nation\u2019s first legislatively supported free grocery market, which serves thousands of residents. Shoppers there find shelves full and are free to pick what they want.",
      "\u201cIt was not like just a handout or a box of food. These people came in and they felt good,\u201d Bastianich says. \u201cThey had integrity in going in and choosing what they\u2019re going to eat, not just accepting what was given to them.\u201d",
      "What Bastianich found on her travels is that small gestures of kindness to someone in your community can do wonders not just for them \u2014 but also for you.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to give big checks or anything. Do something for your neighbor,\u201d she says. \u201cThat connection makes you feel good. It makes you feel more of a human being. And it sort of gives you back that desire to live on positively.\u201d",

      "\u201cMy life doesn't really feel real,\u201d he says at one point, an actor trained in pretending going meta playing an actor trained in pretending. In another scene he muses: \u201cAll my memories are movies.\u201d",

      "Adam Sandler and Laura Dern play Kelly's long-suffering manager and publicist, respectively, while his resentful adult daughters are portrayed by Grace Edwards and Riley Keough. Kelly, we learn, put career first and that meant walking away from things like his daughters' school recitals and making his staff miss things like their daughters\u2019 school recitals. \u201cHe's not our family or our friend,\u201d Dern's character screams in despair. \u201cWe're not to him what he is to us.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- Britain's Royal Mint is celebrating Freddie Mercury with a new coin design that marks 40 years since his iconic Live Aid concert performance.",
      "The coin features an image of the Queen front man, head thrown back and holding the microphone stand midperformance. A musical stave that runs around the edge of the coin represents his four-octave vocal range.",
      "The first coin was struck by Mercury\u2019s sister Kashmira Bulsara at the Royal Mint in Wales last week.",
      "\u201cAs Freddie died young, he didn\u2019t get the chance of being awarded a royal medal for his talents in the music world. So to have a royal coin this way is wonderful and very fitting,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cThe coin perfectly captures his passion and the joy he brought to millions through his music,\" she added. \u201cI think the design is very impressive and they managed to catch the most iconic pose of Freddie, which is so recognizable worldwide.\u201d",
      "The Royal Mint\u2019s director of commemorative coin, Rebecca Morgan, said the timing was perfect for Mercury to be celebrated with his own coin. She said fans had been \u201ccalling out\u201d for it and \u201cthis felt like the year to do it,\" because it\u2019s 40 years since he captivated audiences at the 1985 Live Aid concert, hailed by many as the greatest live gig of all time.",
      "This year also marks the 40th anniversary of Mercury\u2019s solo studio album, \u201cMr Bad Guy.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 \u201cThat \u201970s Show\u201d actor Danny Masterson filed a petition Monday for his two rape convictions and long prison sentence to be thrown out, saying that his trial lawyer failed to call key witnesses and introduce essential evidence that might have exonerated him.",
      "The petition for habeas corpus filed with California's 2nd District Court of Appeal argues that lawyer Philip Cohen did not represent Masterson properly at the 2023 retrial that ended with the actor being convicted of raping two women at his Los Angeles home in 2003. He was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison.",
      "The petition also argues that the trial judge demonstrated a bias against the Church of Scientology, allowing an \u201cunconstitutional intrusion\u201d into the church's doctrine and a misinterpretation of its scripture.",
      "Masterson is a member of the church, whose practices were a major issue at his trial, and the women are former members.",
      "The petition says that Cohen spoke to only two of the 20 potential witnesses brought to his attention by his co-counsel and an investigator. It says the witnesses included some who would have testified that the women spoke favorably of the sexual relationships they had with Masterson. And they included psychological and pharmacological experts who would have testified about the effects of alcohol and drugs on memory.",
      "The court filing says there was \u201cunexpected and unreasonable failure of trial counsel to present any of the mountain of exculpatory evidence\u201d that had been amassed by Masterson's pretrial attorney Shawn Holley, and the result was a violation of his constitutional rights.",
      "Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Charlaine F. Olmedo declined to delay Masterson\u2019s first trial to accommodate Holley\u2019s representation of former Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Trevor Bauer against his own allegations of sexual misconduct. Cohen then took over as lead attorney.",
      "Masterson's first trial ended in a mistrial with a jury unable to reach consensus on any of three rape counts against him. He was promptly retried, and a jury found him guilty of two counts while failing to reach a verdict on the third.",

      "The Metropolitan Museum of Art has announced its next spring fashion exhibit",
      "NEW YORK -- If there's been one uniting theme of all the blockbuster fashion exhibits at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, it\u2019s the simple idea that fashion is art.",
      "\u201cCostume Art,\u201d announced Monday as the next big show at the museum\u2019s Costume Institute \u2014 launched by the starry Met Gala in 2026 \u2014 aims to make that connection more literal than ever, pairing garments with objects from across the museum to show how fashion has long been intertwined with different art forms.",
      "Max Hollein, CEO and director of the Met, said in an interview ahead of Monday\u2019s announcement that he hopes the exhibit will take visitors to the New York museum on a (very fashionable) journey through art history, where they will see connections throughout.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a show that can really live in fascinating ways at the museum and can pull from all different areas of our collection \u2014 paintings, sculpture, drawings,\u201d Hollein said.",
      "\u201cI hope we all agree that fashion is art,\u201d Hollein added. \u201cBut actually I think the exhibition \u2026 will make it obvious how fashion is actually happening, so to say, all across the museum and in all different mediums already.\u201d",
      "The new show will examine the dressed body, and will be organized thematically by different body types, according to the Costume Institute's curator in charge, Andrew Bolton. It will include the \u201cNaked Body\u201d and the \u201cClassical Body,\u201d for example, but also less expected themes like the \u201cPregnant Body\u201d and the \u201cAging Body.\u201d",
      "The connections that will be drawn between artworks and garments will range, curators said in a statement, \u201cfrom the formal to the conceptual, the aesthetic to the political, the individual to the universal, the illustrative to the symbolic, and the playful to the profound.\u201d",
      "One example: in the \u201cNaked Body\u201d section, a 1504 print from German artist Albrecht D\u00fcrer will be paired with spandex bodysuits by Belgian designer Walter Van Beirendonck from a 2009 collection that revisits the story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.",

      "\u201cMaking movies is not what I do, it's who I am,\u201d said Cruise. He was composed as always, but at moments seemed near tears as he spoke, grasping the gold honorary statuette that celebrated his more than 40 years at the apex of the industry at the film academy's annual Governors Awards.",
      "\u201cIn that theater we laugh together, we feel together, we hope together,\u201d he said after a two-minute ovation.",
      "Production designer Wynn Thomas and choreographer and actor Debbie Allen were also selected by the academy's board of governors to be honored for their storied careers, and an absent Dolly Parton was honored for a lifetime of philanthropy at the ceremony at the Ray Dolby Ballroom in Los Angeles.",
      "A competitive Oscar has eluded Cruise, who's been nominated four times: as an actor for 1989\u2019s \u201cBorn on the Fourth of July,\u201d 1996\u2019s \u201cJerry Maguire\u201d and 1999\u2019s \u201cMagnolia,\u201d and as a producer for 2022\u2019s \u201cTop Gun: Maverick.\u201d",

      "\u201cI will always do everything I can to help this art form,\u201d Cruise said. \u201cTo support and champion new voices, to protect what makes cinema powerful. Hopefully without too many more broken bones.\u201d",
      "Oscar-winning director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu presented Cruise the award. The two have spent several months shooting a film in London set for release in 2026. The collaboration suggests that Cruise, who has stuck to blockbuster franchise fare in recent years, might not be done trying to win an Academy Award the old-fashioned way.",
      "\u201cThis may be his first Oscar,\u201d I\u00f1\u00e1rritu said, \u201cbut from what I have seen and experienced, this will not be the last.\u201d",

      "His freewheeling tunes and cosmic-stoner songwriting made him a beloved figure.",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Todd Snider, a singer whose thoughtfully freewheeling tunes and cosmic-stoner songwriting made him a beloved figure in American roots music, has died. He was 59.",
      "His record label said Saturday in a statement posted to his social media accounts that Snider died Friday.",
      "\u201cWhere do we find the words for the one who always had the right words, who knew how to distill everything down to its essence with words and song while delivering the most devastating, hilarious, and impactful turn of phrases?\u201d the statement read. \u201cAlways creating rhyme and meter that immediately felt like an old friend or a favorite blanket. Someone who could almost always find the humor in this crazy ride on Planet Earth.\u201d",
      "Snider's family and friends had said in a Friday statement that he had been diagnosed with pneumonia at a hospital in Hendersonville, Tennessee, and that his situation had since grown more complicated and he was transferred elsewhere. The diagnosis came on the heels of the cancellation of a tour after Snider had been the victim of a violent assault in the Salt Lake City area, according to a Nov. 3 statement from his management team.",
      "But Salt Lake City police later arrested Snider himself when he at first refused to leave a hospital and later returned and threatened staffers, the Salt Lake Tribune reported.",
      "The scrapped tour was in support of his most recent album, \u201cHigh, Lonesome and Then Some,\u201d which released in October. Snider combined elements of folk, rock and country in a three-decade career. In reviews of his recent albums, The Associated Press called him a \u201csinger-songwriter with the persona of a fried folkie\u201d and a \u201cstoner troubadour and cosmic comic.\u201d",
      "He modeled himself on \u2014 and at times met and was mentored by \u2014 artists like Kris Kristofferson, Guy Clark and John Prine. His songs were recorded by artists including Jerry Jeff Walker, Billy Joe Shaver and Tom Jones. And he co-wrote a song with Loretta Lynn that appeared on her 2016 album, \u201cFull Circle.\u201d",

      "Snider would do his best-known and most acclaimed work for Prine's independent label Oh Boy in the early 2000s. It included the albums \u201cNew Connection,\u201d \u201cNear Truths and Hotel Rooms\u201d and \u201cEast Nashville Skyline,\u201d a 2004 collection that's considered by many to be his best.",

      "Snider had an early fan in Jimmy Buffett, who signed the young artist to his record label, Margaritaville, which released his first two albums, 1994's \u201cSongs for the Daily Planet\u201d and 1996's \u201cStep Right Up.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Sometimes our immune system runs amok and attacks the organ that makes us \u201cus\u201d \u2014 the brain",
      "\u201cMy year of unraveling\u201d is how a despairing Christy Morrill described nightmarish months when his immune system hijacked his brain.",
      "What\u2019s called autoimmune encephalitis attacks the organ that makes us \u201cus,\u201d and it can appear out of the blue.",
      "Morrill went for a bike ride with friends along the California coast, stopping for lunch, and they noticed nothing wrong. Neither did Morrill until his wife asked how it went \u2014 and he'd forgotten. Morrill would get worse before he got better. \u201cUnhinged\u201d and \u201cfighting to see light,\u201d he wrote as delusions set in and holes in his memory grew.",
      "Of all the ways our immune system can run amok and damage the body instead of protecting it, autoimmune encephalitis is one of the most unfathomable. Seemingly healthy people abruptly spiral with confusion, memory loss, seizures, even psychosis.",
      "But doctors are getting better at identifying it, thanks to discoveries of a growing list of the rogue antibodies responsible that, if found in blood and spinal fluid, aid diagnosis. Every year new culprit antibodies are being uncovered, said Dr. Sam Horng, a neurologist at Mount Sinai Health System in New York who has cared for patients with multiple forms of this mysterious disease.",
      "And while treatment today involves general ways to fight the inflammation, two major clinical trials are underway aiming for more targeted therapy.",
      "Still, it's tricky. Symptoms can be mistaken for psychiatric or other neurologic disorders, delaying proper treatment.",
      "\u201cWhen someone\u2019s having new changes in their mental status, they\u2019re worsening and if there\u2019s sort of like a bizarre quality to it, that\u2019s something that kind of tips our suspicion,\u201d Horng said. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to miss a treatable condition.\u201d",
      "With early diagnosis and care, some patients fully recover. Others like Morrill recover normal daily functioning but grapple with some lasting damage \u2014 in his case, lost decades of \u201cautobiographical\u201d memories. This 72-year-old literature major can still spout facts and figures learned long ago, and he makes new memories every day. But even family photos can\u2019t help him recall pivotal moments in his own life.",
      "\u201cI remember \u2018Ulysses\u2019 is published in Paris in 1922 at Sylvia Beach\u2019s bookstore. Why do I remember that, which is of no use to me anymore, and yet I can\u2019t remember my son\u2019s wedding?\u201d Morrill wonders.",
      "Encephalitis means the brain is inflamed and symptoms can vary from mild to life-threatening. Infections are a common cause, typically requiring treatment of the underlying virus or bacteria. But when that's ruled out, an autoimmune cause has to be considered, Horng said, especially when symptoms arise suddenly.",
      "The umbrella term autoimmune encephalitis covers a group of diseases with weird-sounding names based on the antibody fueling it, such as anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.",
      "While they're not new diseases, that one got a name in 2007 when Dr. Josep Dalmau, then at the University of Pennsylvania, discovered the first culprit antibody, sparking a hunt for more.",
      "That anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis tends to strike younger women and, one of the bizarre factors, it\u2019s sometimes triggered by an ovarian \u201cdermoid\u201d cyst.",
      "How? That type of cyst has similarities to some brain tissue, Horng explained. The immune system can develop antibodies recognizing certain proteins from the growth. If those antibodies get into the brain, they can mistakenly target NMDA receptors on healthy brain cells, sparking personality and behavior changes that can include hallucinations.",
      "Different antibodies create different problems depending if they mostly hit memory and mood areas in the brain, or sensory and movement regions.",
      "Altogether, \u201cfacets of personhood seem to be impaired,\" Horng said.",
      "Therapies include filtering harmful antibodies out of patients' blood, infusing healthy ones, and high-dose steroids to calm inflammation.",
      "Those cyst-related antibodies stealthily attacked Kiara Alexander in Charlotte, North Carolina, who\u2019d never heard of the brain illness. She\u2019d brushed off some oddities \u2014 a little forgetfulness, zoning out a few minutes \u2014 until she found herself in an ambulance because of a seizure.",

      "In San Carlos, California, in early 2020, it was taking months to determine what caused Morrill's sudden memory problem. He remembered facts and spoke eloquently but was losing recall of personal events, a weird combination that prompted Dr. Michael Cohen, a neurologist at Sutter Health, to send him for more specialized testing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very unusual, I mean extremely unusual, to just complain of a problem with autobiographical memory,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cOne has to think about unusual disorders.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile Morrill\u2019s wife, Karen, thought she\u2019d detected subtle seizures \u2014 and one finally happened in front of another doctor, helping spur a spinal tap and diagnosis of LGI1-antibody encephalitis.",
      "It\u2019s a type most common in men over age 50. Those rogue antibodies disrupt how neurons signal each other, and MRI scans showed they\u2019d targeted a key memory center.",
      "By then Morrill, who\u2019d spent retirement guiding kayak tours, could no longer safely get on the water. He\u2019d quit reading and as his treatments changed, he\u2019d get agitated with scary delusions.",
      "\u201cI lost total mental capacity and fell apart,\u201d Morrill describes it.",

      "The nonprofit Autoimmune Encephalitis Alliance lists about two dozen antibodies \u2014 and counting \u2014 known to play a role in these brain illnesses so far.",
      "Clinical trials, offered at major medical centers around the country, are testing two drugs now used for other autoimmune diseases to see if tamping down antibody production can ease encephalitis.",
      "More awareness of these rare diseases is critical, said North Carolina's Alexander, who sought out fellow patients. \u201cThat's a terrible feeling, feeling like you're alone.\u201d",
      "As for Morrill, five years later he still grieves decades of lost memories: family gatherings, a year spent studying in Scotland, the travel with his wife.",

      "Here\u2019s what to know about SNAP:",
      "For the first part of the month, the situation was chaotic after the federal government said SNAP would not be funded because of the government shutdown.",
      "Some states replenished the electronic benefit cards used in the program either fully or partially, using their own funds or federal dollars that were part of court orders. Others didn't.",
      "Most states boosted food charities, but lines were long and some shelves were empty.",
      "As soon as the government reopened on Nov. 12, many states rushed to get out benefits.",
      "By Tuesday, all states either had loaded full November benefits onto people\u2019s electronic spending cards or were working on it, according to an Associated Press review. Participants should receive December SNAP benefits according to their normal schedule.",
      "A massive tax and spending bill signed into law in July by Trump expanded requirements for many adult SNAP recipients to work, volunteer or participate in job training for at least 80 hours a month. Those who don\u2019t are limited to three months of benefits in a three-year period.",
      "The work requirements previously applied to adults ages 18 through 54 who are physically and mentally able and don\u2019t have dependents. The new law also applies those requirements to those ages 55 through 64 and to parents without children younger than 14. It repeals work exemptions for homeless individuals, veterans and young adults aging out of foster care. And it limits the ability of states to waive work requirements in areas lacking jobs.",
      "The Trump administration waived the work requirements in November, but the three-month clock on work-free SNAP benefits will be in full force in December.",

      "NEW YORK -- Over 74,000 people enrolled in experiments have been affected by the National Institutes of Health's funding cuts, according to a new report.",
      "Between the end of February and mid-August, funding ceased for 383 studies that were testing treatments for conditions including cancer, heart disease and brain disease.

      "At the halfway point of annual United Nations climate negotiations in Brazil, it appears the talks may do more than just focus on implementing past promises, as some observers had expected",
      "BELEM, Brazil -- Going into United Nations climate negotiations, the Brazilian hosts weren\u2019t looking for big end-of-session pronouncements on lofty goals. This conference was supposed to hyperfocus on \u201cimplementation\u201d of past promises not yet kept.",
      "Throw that out the window.",
      "The urgency of climate change is causing some negotiators to push for more big-picture action \u2014 on weak plans to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases, on too little money to help nations wracked by climate change, on putting teeth into phasing out coal, oil and gas. Because of that pressure to do more \u2014 including from Brazil President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva \u2014 the diplomat chairing the talks said Saturday he'll consider a big-picture, end-of-negotiations communiqu\u00e9, sometimes known as a decision or cover text.",
      "\u201cI think things have changed, which is a very good thing,\u201d said veteran observer Jean Su of the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cSo I think there\u2019s momentum that we will get some type of decision text, and our hope is that in particular there\u2019s going to be some commitment on phasing out fossil fuels.\u201d",
      "\u201cI would say that what\u2019s at stake now is probably higher than the last several COPs because you\u2019re looking at an ambition gap,\u2033 said former Philippine negotiator Jasper Inventor, international program director at Greenpeace International. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of expectation, there\u2019s a lot of excitement here, but there\u2019s also a lot of political signals that\u2019s been sent by President Lula.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re at the middle of the COP, and at the middle of COP is usually where the negotiators stare each other eye-to-eye. It\u2019s almost like a staring contest,\u201d Inventor said. \u201cBut next week, this is where the negotiations need to happen, where political decisions are made by the ministers.\u201d",
      "Because this process stems from the Paris climate Agreement, which is mostly voluntary, these end statements grab headlines and set global tone but have limited power. The last few COP end statements have made still-unfulfilled pledges for rich countries to give money to poor nations to cope with climate change and the world to phase out fossil fuels.",
      "Key among those issues is the idea of telling nations to go back to the drawing board on what experts consider inadequate climate-fighting plans submitted this year.",
      "In the 2015 Paris agreement, which is being celebrated here on its 10th anniversary, nations are supposed to have submitted climate-fighting, emissions-curbing plans every five years. So far 116 of 193 countries have filed theirs this year, but what they promised isn\u2019t much. United Nations and Climate Action Tracker, a group of scientists, calculates that these new pledges barely reduced future projections for Earth's warming.",
      "Even if the world does all it promises, Earth would be about seven-tenths of a degree Celsius (1.3 degrees Fahrenheit) above the Paris goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, the groups estimated.",
      "So small island nations, led by Palau, asked that this conference confront the gap between what\u2019s planned in national pledges and what\u2019s needed to keep the world from hitting the temperature danger zone.",
      "That's not on the agenda for these talks. Nor are specific details on how to fulfill last year\u2019s pledge by rich nations to provide $300 billion annually in climate financial aid.",
      "So when nations early on wanted to address these issues, COP President Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago, a veteran Brazilian diplomat, set up special small confabs to try to decide if the controversial topics should be discussed.",
      "On Saturday, the conference punted the issue to the incoming ministers.",
      "\u201cThe parties will decide how they want to proceed,\u201d do Lago said at a Saturday evening news conference. Given what countries are saying and past history that usually means a final end-of-COP message to the world, several experts said.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s plan for ending the war in Ukraine would cede territory to Russia and limit the size of Kyiv\u2019s military, according to a draft proposal obtained by The Associated Press",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's plan for ending the war in Ukraine would cede land to Russia and limit the size of Kyiv's military, according to a draft obtained Thursday by The Associated Press.",
      "The proposal, originating from negotiations between Washington and Moscow, appeared decidedly favorable to Russia, which started the war nearly four years ago by invading its neighbor. If past is prologue, it would seem untenable for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has opposed Trump's previous calls for territorial concessions.",
      "A side agreement aims to satisfy Ukrainian security concerns by saying a future \u201csignificant, deliberate and sustained armed attack\u201d by Russia would be viewed as \u201cthreatening the peace and security of the transatlantic community.\u201d The agreement, which was detailed by a senior U.S. official who was not authorized to publicly discuss the matter, does not obligate the United States or European allies to intervene on Ukraine's behalf, although it says they would \u201cdetermine the measures necessary to restore security.\u201d",
      "Trump's push to end the war could drive a wedge between himself and European leaders, who are likely to oppose any agreement that could be seen as rewarding Russian President Vladimir Putin for his aggression, leaving him emboldened rather than defeated.",
      "For example, the proposal would not only bar Ukraine from joining NATO but would also prevent the alliance's future expansion. Such a step would be a significant victory for Moscow, which views NATO as a threat.",
      "Putin would also gain ground he has been unable to win on the battlefield. Under the draft, Moscow would hold all the eastern Donbas region, even though approximately 14% still remains in Ukrainian hands. Ukraine's military, currently at roughly 880,000 troops, would be reduced to 600,000.",
      "The proposal opens the door to lifting sanctions on Russia and returning it to what was formerly known as the Group of Eight, which includes many of the world\u2019s biggest economies. Russia was suspended from the annual gathering in 2014 following its annexation of Crimea, a strategically important peninsula on the northern coast of the Black Sea that is internationally recognized as part of Ukraine.",
      "The U.S. team began drawing up the plan soon after U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff held talks with Rustem Umerov, a top adviser to Zelenskyy, according to a senior administration official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The official added that Umerov agreed to the majority of the plan, after making several modifications, and then presented it to Zelenskyy.",
      "U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll was also in Kyiv on Thursday and discussed the latest draft with Zelenskyy, according to a senior administration official. Zelenskyy offered a measured statement on social media about it but did not directly speak to the substance of the proposal.",
      "\u201cOur teams \u2014 of Ukraine and the United States \u2014 will work on the provisions of the plan to end the war. We are ready for constructive, honest and swift work,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, has informed the White House he\u2019ll leave his post in January, according to two senior administration officials.",
      "Kellogg was initially named special envoy for Ukraine and Russia during Trump\u2019s presidential transition. But his role shrunk as Witkoff, a real estate developer turned diplomat, emerged as the president\u2019s chief interlocutor with Putin and his advisers.",
      "Under the proposal, Russia would commit to making no future attacks, something the White House views as a concession. In addition, $100 billion in frozen Russian assets would be dedicated to rebuilding Ukraine.",
      "However, handing over territory to Russia would be deeply unpopular in Ukraine. It also would be illegal under Ukraine\u2019s constitution. Zelenskyy has repeatedly ruled out such a possibility.",
      "Russia would also be allowed to keep half of the power generated by Europe\u2019s largest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhia, which it captured from Ukraine early during the war.",
      "The draft calls for a \u201cPeace Council\u201d that Trump will oversee. The council is an idea that Trump snatched from his lengthy peace plan aimed at bringing about a permanent end to war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.",
      "If either Ukraine or Russia violated the truce once enacted, it would face sanctions.",
      "U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., an Air Force veteran, rejected the emerging plan. \u201cUnacceptable,\u201d he posted on social media. \u201cIt is a 1938 Munich,\u201d referring to a diplomatic agreement aimed at securing peace with Nazi Germany but widely viewed as paving the way for World War II.",

      "As reports about the draft emerged, blindsided European diplomats insisted they and Ukraine must be consulted.",
      "European leaders have already been alarmed this year by indications that Trump\u2019s administration might be sidelining them and Zelenskyy in its push to stop the fighting.

      "Ukraine\u2019s deputy U.N. Ambassador Khrystyna Hayovyshyn told the U.N. Security Council that Kyiv has officially received Trump\u2019s draft peace plan and is ready \u201cto work constructively,\u201d but she stressed Ukraine\u2019s \u201cred lines.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere will never be any recognition, formal or otherwise, of Ukrainian territory temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation as Russian,\u201d she said. \u201cOur land is not for sale.\u201d",
      "\u201cUkraine will not accept any limits on its right to self-defense or on the size and capabilities of our armed forces, nor will we tolerate any infringement on our sovereignty, including our sovereign right to choose the alliances we want to join,\u201d Hayovyshyn added.",
      "It was not clear whether European foreign ministers had seen the peace plan, which was first reported by Axios.",
      "Although they appeared caught by surprise, some elements of the plan were not new. Trump said last month that the Donbas region should be \u201ccut up,\u201d leaving most of it in Russian hands.",
      "However, the administration's previous diplomatic efforts this year to stop the fighting have so far come to nothing. A summit between Trump and Putin in Alaska did not result in a breakthrough over the summer, and plans for them to meet again in Budapest, Hungary, did not come to fruition.",
      "Trump frequently complained that the negotiations involving Ukraine were taking longer than other conflicts where he helped mediate.",
      "\u201cI thought that was going to be my easy one because I have a good relationship with President Putin,\u201d he said this week. \u201cBut I\u2019m a little disappointed in President Putin right now.\u201d",

      "Nineteen countries on the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s 35-member board of governors voted for the resolution at the IAEA's headquarters in Vienna, according to diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the outcome of the closed-doors vote.",

      "Since Israel and the United States struck Iran\u2019s nuclear sites during the 12-day war in June, Iran has not given IAEA inspectors access to nuclear sites that were affected by the strikes \u2014 even though Tehran is legally obliged to cooperate with the watchdog under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.",
      "The agency also has been unable to verify the status of the stockpile of near weapons-grade uranium since the June bombing, according to a confidential IAEA report seen by the AP last week.",

      "But that hasn't quieted the political storm. After more than three years of war in which Ukrainians face regular power outages as a result of Russia's fierce bombardment, allegations of corruption in the energy sector aren't sitting well with the public. Calls are growing for Zelenskyy to remove his longtime chief of staff, Andrii Yermak, considered by many to be Ukraine\u2019s de facto vice president.",

      "Ukraine has been plagued by corruption since gaining independence, and Zelenskyy was elected on a mandate to eliminate graft.",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- On the frozen edge of the world, staying in practice as a professional musician takes ingenuity, grit and a plastic instrument for schoolchildren that\u2019s guaranteed not to freeze to your fingers or face.",
      "Natalie Paine is a French horn player in New Zealand\u2019s navy who since October has been among 21 military members stationed in Antarctica. There, her melodies drift across the frozen Ross Sea from perhaps the most remote practice room on Earth.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful and very inspiring,\u201d Paine told the Associated Press. \u201cI\u2019ll sit there by the window and I will do my routine and play music in my time off, which is not very often.\u201d",
      "The story of how she arrived in Antarctica is an unlikely one. Paine grew up in the hot, dry climate of Adelaide, Australia, where she dreamed of visiting the frozen continent as a scientist.",
      "She studied music at university instead, putting Antarctica out of her mind. Years later however, as a musician in New Zealand\u2019s navy, Paine learned members of the country\u2019s military were stationed in Antarctica to support the work of scientists.",
      "When she asked, her instructor said any military member could win one of the coveted assignments.",
      "\u201cMy eyes lit up and I was like, what? Even a musician?\u201d Paine said. \u201cHe\u2019s like, heck yeah, why not?\u201d",
      "Her dream was revived but enacting it wasn\u2019t simple. It took four years of unsuccessful applications before Paine landed a posting as a communications operator.",
      "It\u2019s a consuming job, worked in six-day stretches that leave little time for music. Paine monitors radio, phone, email and other communications traffic at New Zealand\u2019s mission at Scott Base, sometimes speaking to people on the ice who haven\u2019t heard other voices for weeks.",
      "In whatever window she can find, Paine squeezes in scales and mouth exercises, going to great lengths not to disturb others on round-the-clock shifts. That means slipping out of the main base to a hut built in 1957 under the leadership of explorer Sir Edmund Hillary as New Zealand established its presence in Antarctica.",
      "While she plays by the window, watching seals on the ice, Paine finds new musical motifs bubbling up.",

Some of them got side jobs, but others simply couldn't afford the child care or gas they needed to work. Their absences forced delays at airports across the country and led the government to cut some of their flights at 40 busy airports.",

      "They still can\u2019t believe the bus they wrote off as a goner is now ready to take them on another surfing adventure. The last time they saw a pre-burned Azul was two days before the Palisades Fire broke out, when they parked the bus near Weinraub's apartment after surfing.",

      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- GE Appliances on Thursday touted wide-ranging ripple effects from shifting production from China to Kentucky as it announced more than $150 million in new contracts awarded to U.S.-based suppliers.",
      "The supplier contracts range in value from $330,000 to $41 million, span 10 states and cover crucial segments of the supplier chain for the appliance maker's washer and dryer production \u2014 from plastics and castings to steel and aluminum, the company said. The suppliers range in size from U.S. Steel to family-owned companies.",
      "With the new contracts, GE Appliances said it is increasing domestic spending on suppliers by 3.3%.",
      "The suppliers will support production of a combo washer/dryer and a lineup of front load washers, all of which GE Appliances is moving from China to its sprawling Louisville complex known as Appliance Park. The company says it's investing $490 million to retool a plant for the project, which will create 800 new jobs.",
      "Production is scheduled to begin in early 2027, it said, and will expand the total footprint devoted to clothes care production at Appliance Park to the equivalent of 33 football fields.",
      "\u201cWhen we invest in U.S. manufacturing and our people, it drives growth far beyond our own walls,\u201d Lee Lagomarcino, a GE Appliances vice president, said Thursday in a news release. \u201cThese new supplier contracts represent what \u2018Built for America\u2019 is all about \u2014 investing in U.S. manufacturing, creating more American jobs and building opportunity that multiplies.\u201d",
      "The announcements come as President Donald Trump attempts to lure factories back to the United States by imposing import taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on foreign goods. The president recently said the U.S. would lower tariffs implemented earlier this year as punishment on China for its selling of chemicals used to make fentanyl from 20% to 10%. That brings the total combined tariff rate on China down from 57% to 47%.",

      "GE Appliances said it spends $4.6 billion with more than 6,500 U.S. suppliers, a 69% increase in spending and a 58% rise in its number of suppliers since 2019. Its U.S. supply chain has grown for more than a decade, it said.",
      "\"While tariffs have certainly been a factor, there are also many other benefits such as shorter lead times, reduced transportation costs and the ability to collaborate with your supply chain to ultimately serve our customers better,\u201d Lagomarcino said.",
      "The new contracts were awarded to businesses in Kentucky, Tennessee, Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota, Alabama and California, GE Appliances said. It awarded more than $40 million in contracts to suppliers in Kentucky, more than in any other state.",
      "The contracts are the first of many expected ripple effects from its broader, five-year, $3 billion commitment to strengthen its U.S. manufacturing, reshore certain production and create more than 1,000 jobs, the company said. GE Appliances announced plans in August to shift production of refrigerators, gas ranges and water heaters out of China and Mexico.

      "The market\u2019s focus remained on Nvidia as Wall Street\u2019s most influential stock jumped 5.1% overnight after the chipmaker reported third-quarter earnings of $31.9 billion. That's a 65% increase over last year and more than analysts were expecting.",
      "The Santa Clara, California company also forecast revenue for the current quarter covering November-January will come in at about $65 billion, nearly $3 billion above analysts\u2019 projections, an indication that demand for its AI chips remains feverish.",
      "Nvidia is the most valuable company by market capitalization on Wall Street, having briefly topped $5 trillion in value. That means its movements have more of an effect on the S&P 500 than any other stock, and it can single-handedly steer the index\u2019s direction some days.",

      "The job market has been slowing enough this year that the Fed has already cut its main interest rate twice. Lower rates can give a boost to the economy and to prices for investments, and the expectation on Wall Street had been for more cuts, including at the Fed\u2019s next meeting in December.",

      "While the hosts have admitted that the U.S. absence raises concerns about the summit's ultimate success, South Africa's foreign minister, Ronald Lamola, said Tuesday it was also an opportunity \u201cto send a clear message that the world can move on\" without the U.S. \u2014 but that it won't be easy.",

      "Lamola also cited China's Xi Jinping who has not been travelling much this year, instead sending Premier Li Qiang to represent him \u2014 including in South Africa.",

      "The unemployment rate rose to 4.4% in September, highest since October 2021 and up from 4.3% in August, the Labor Department said Thursday. The unemployment rate rose partly because 470,000 people entered the labor market \u2014 either working or looking for work \u2014 in September and not all of them found jobs right away.",

      "Greystar, the nation\u2019s largest landlord, has reached a $7 million settlement with nine states that sued the property management giant for using rent-setting algorithms that officials have blamed for driving up housing costs.",
      "The proposed settlement, filed Tuesday in a North Carolina federal court, is the latest to result from antitrust lawsuits targeting RealPage and similar software companies. Prosecutors argue the products help rival property managers illegally align prices and push up rents. A judge must still approve the deal.",
      "\u201cWhether it\u2019s through smoke-filled backroom deals or through an algorithm on your computer screen, colluding to drive up prices is illegal,\u201d Democratic California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a news release. \u201cFamilies across the country are staring down an affordability crisis. Companies that intentionally fuel this unaffordability by raising prices to line their own pockets can be sure I will use the full force of my office to hold them accountable.\u201d",
      "As part of the settlement, Greystar will no longer use software that relies on other landlords\u2019 confidential data to set rents. Greystar also agreed separately last month to pay $50 million to settle a class-action lawsuit over its use of RealPage. And in August, the company reached a separate nonmonetary deal with the Department of Justice to halt similar practices.",
      "\u201cWe are pleased this matter is resolved and remain focused on serving our residents and clients,\u201d Greystar said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Based in South Carolina, Greystar manages more than 946,000 units nationwide, according to the National Multifamily Housing Council. RealPage, which is based in Texas, has said its software is used on fewer than 10% of rental units in the U.S., and that its price recommendations are used less than half the time.

It argues that the real driver of high rents is a lack of housing supply, and says its pricing recommendations often encourage landlords to drop rents since they are incentivized to maximize revenue by maintaining high occupancy.",
      "The RealPage software provides daily recommendations to help landlords and their employees price their available apartments. The landlords do not have to follow the suggestions, but critics argue that because the software has access to a vast trove of confidential data, it helps RealPage\u2019s clients charge the highest possible rent.",

      "The changes include the elimination of the Fish and Wildlife Service's \u201cblanket rule\" that automatically protects animals and plants newly classified as threatened. Government agencies instead would have to craft species-specific rules for protections, a potentially lengthy process.",
      "Environmentalists warned the changes could cause yearslong delays in efforts to save species such as the monarch butterfly, Florida manatee, California spotted owl and North American wolverine.",
      "\u201cWe would have to wait until these poor animals are almost extinct before we can start protecting them. That\u2019s absurd and heartbreaking,\u201d said Stephanie Kurose with the Center for Biological Diversity.",
      "The proposals come as extinctions have accelerated globally because of habitat loss and other pressures. Prior proposals during Trump's second term would revise the definition of \u201charm\u201d under the Endangered Species Act and potentially bypass species protections for logging projects in national forests and on public lands.",
      "Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement that the administration was restoring the Endangered Species Act to its original intent while respecting \u201cthe livelihoods of Americans who depend on our land and resources.\u201d",
      "The changes answer longstanding calls for revisions to the 1973 Endangered Species Act from Republicans in Congress and industries including oil and gas, mining and agriculture. Those critics argue the law has been wielded too broadly, to the detriment of economic growth.",

      "\u201cThese revisions end years of legal confusion and regulatory overreach, delivering certainty to states, tribes, landowners and businesses while ensuring conservation efforts remain grounded in sound science and common sense,\u201d Burgum said in a statement.",
      "The Interior Department was sued over the blanket protection rule in March, by the Property and Environment Research Center (PERC) and Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation. The two groups argued the rule was illegal and discouraged states and landowners from assisting in species recovery efforts.",
      "PERC Vice President Jonathan Wood said Wednesday's proposal was a \u201cnecessary course correction\u201d from the Biden administration's actions.",
      "\u201cThis reform acknowledges the blanket rule\u2019s unlawfulness and puts recovery back at the heart of the Endangered Species Act,\u201d Wood said.",

      "Health officials say at least 31 babies in 15 states have been treated for botulism as an outbreak tied to ByHeart formula continues to grow",
      "As cases of potentially deadly botulism in babies who drank ByHeart infant formula continue to grow, state officials say they are still finding the recalled product on some store shelves.",
      "Meanwhile the company reported late Wednesday that laboratory tests confirmed that some samples of formula were contaminated with the type of bacteria that has sickened more than 30 babies in the outbreak.",
      "Tests by an independent food safety laboratory found Clostridium botulinum, a bacterium that produces toxins that can lead to potentially life threatening illness in babies younger than 1, the company said on its website. ByHeart officials said they notified the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of the findings but did not specify how many samples were tested or how many were positive.",
      "\u201cWe are working to investigate the facts, conduct ongoing testing to identify the source, and ensure this does not happen to families again,\u201d ByHeart said on its website.",
      "The FDA did not immediately respond to questions about the findings.",
      "The lab results come as investigators in at least three states found ByHeart formula still for sale even after the New York-based company recalled all products nationwide, officials told The Associated Press.",
      "At least 31 babies in 15 states who drank ByHeart formula have been hospitalized and treated for infantile botulism since August, federal health officials said Wednesday. They range in age from about 2 weeks to about 6 months, with the most recent case reported on Nov. 13.",
      "No deaths have been reported.",
      "In Oregon, nine of more than 150 stores checked still had the formula on shelves this week, a state agriculture official said. In Minnesota, investigators conducted 119 checks between Nov. 13 and Nov. 17 and removed recalled products from sale at four sites, an agriculture department official said. An Arizona health official also said they found the product available.",
      "Businesses and consumers should remain alert, Minnesota officials said in a statement. \u201cNo affected product should be sold or consumed,\u201d they wrote.",

      "Infant botulism, which can cause paralysis and death, is caused by a type of bacteria that forms spores that germinate in a baby's gut and produce a toxin.",
      "Symptoms can take up to 30 days to develop and include constipation, poor feeding, a weak cry, drooping eyelids or a flat facial expression. Babies can develop weakness in their limbs and head and may feel \u201cfloppy.\u201d They can have trouble swallowing or breathing.",
      "ByHeart had been manufacturing about 200,000 cans of formula per month. It was sold online or at retail stores such as Target and Walmart. A Walmart spokesperson said the company swiftly issued a restriction that prevented sale of the formula, removed the product from stores and notified consumers who had bought it. Customers can visit any store for a refund of the formula, which sold for about $42 per can.",
      "Federal and state health officials are concerned that some parents and caregivers may still have ByHeart products in their homes. They are advising consumers to stop using the product \u2014 including formula in cans and any single-serve sticks. They also suggest marking it \u201cDO NOT USE\u201d and keeping it for at least a month in case a baby develops symptoms. In that case, the formula would need to be tested.",
      "The California health department operates the Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program, which tracks cases and distributes treatment for the disease. Officials there have launched a public hotline at 833-398-2022, which is staffed with health officials from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. Pacific Standard Time.",
      "The new hotline was created after calls from hundreds of parents and caregivers flooded a different, longstanding hotline for doctors to discuss suspected infant botulism cases, officials said.",

      "NEW YORK -- Target\u2019s third-quarter profit tumbled as the retailer struggles to lure shoppers that are being pressed by stubbornly high inflation.",
      "The Minneapolis company said Wednesday that it expects its sales slump to extend through the critical holiday shopping season. The company also announced that it's planning to invest another billion dollars next year to remodel stores and build new ones, increasing the total cost for the makeover to $5 billion.",
      "Investors have punished Target\u2019s stock recently, sending it down 43% over the past year. Shares edged lower before the opening bell.",
      "Turning around the 19% profit slide in the most recent quarter is the latest challenge to incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke, a 20-year company veteran who is replacing CEO Brian Cornell on Feb. 1. The handover arrives as the retailer tries to reverse a persistent sales malaise and to revive its reputation as the place to go for affordable but stylish products.",
      "Target\u2019s troubles stand in stark contrast to rival Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest retailer, which is thriving. Walmart reports on it's most recent quarterly performance Thursday.",
      "Target announced in October that it was eliminating about 1,800 corporate positions in an effort to streamline decision-making and accelerate initiatives to rebuild the flagging customer base. The cuts represent about 8% of Target\u2019s corporate workforce.",
      "To pump up sales, Target is offering more than 20,000 new items, twice as many as last year, and it has lowered prices on thousands of food, beverage and essential items.",
      "\u201cWe have high but achievable aspirations for Target\u2019s future, and we\u2019re acting urgently to make the changes and investments,\u201d Fiddelke told reporters on Tuesday.",
      "With about 1,980 U.S. stores, Target has struggled to find its footing since inflation caused pinched shoppers to curtail their discretionary spending. Customers have complained of messy stores with merchandise that did not reflect the expensive-looking but budget-priced niche that long ago earned the retailer the jokingly posh nickname \u201cTarzhay.\u201d",
      "Consumer boycotts since late January, when Target joined rival Walmart and a number of other prominent American brands in scaling back its corporate diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, have compounded the predicament.",
      "Retailers have spent almost 11 months navigating President Donald Trump\u2019s wide-ranging tariffs on imports and his immigration crackdown that threatened to shrink the supply of workers.",
      "The just ended 43-day federal shutdown is expected to be another drag on an economy, though its full impact will take months to measure. Government contract awards have slowed and many food aid recipients have seen their benefits interrupted.",
      "Fiddelke told reporters that the company saw a weaker September but he said it was \u201ctricky for us to isolate\u201d the different factors behind that.",

      "China is rapidly replacing its aging diesel trucks with electric models, signaling a major shift in the world\u2019s largest vehicle market",
      "HANOI, Vietnam -- China is replacing its diesel trucks with electric models faster than expected, potentially reshaping global fuel demand and the future of heavy transport.",
      "In 2020, nearly all new trucks in China ran on diesel. By the first half of 2025, battery-powered trucks accounted for 22% of new heavy truck sales, up from 9.2% in the same period in 2024, according to Commercial Vehicle World, a Beijing-based trucking data provider. The British research firm BMI forecasts electric trucks will reach nearly 46% of new sales this year and 60% next year.",
      "Heavy trucks carry the lifeblood of modern economies. They also contribute significantly to global emissions of carbon-dioxide: In 2019, road freight generated a third of all transport-related carbon emissions.",
      "Trucking has been considered hard to decarbonize since electric trucks with heavy batteries can carry less cargo than those using energy-dense diesel. Proponents of liquefied natural gas have viewed it as a less polluting option while technology for electric heavy vehicles matures.",
      "Liquefied natural gas, or LNG, is natural gas cooled to a liquid fuel for easy storage and transport.",
      "China\u2019s trucking fleet, the world\u2019s second-largest after the U.S., still mainly runs on diesel, but the landscape is shifting. Transport fuel demand is plateauing, according to the International Energy Agency and diesel use in China could decline faster than many expect, said Christopher Doleman, an analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.",
      "Electric trucks now outsell LNG models in China, so its demand for fossil fuels could fall, and \"in other countries, it might never take off,\u201d he said.",
      "The share of electrics in new truck sales, from 8% in 2024 to 28% by August 2025, has more than tripled as prices have fallen. Electric trucks outsold LNG-powered vehicles in China for five consecutive months this year, according to Commercial Vehicle World.",
      "While electric trucks are two to three times more expensive than diesel ones and cost roughly 18% more than LNG trucks, their higher energy efficiency and lower costs can save owners an estimated 10% to 26% over the vehicle\u2019s lifetime, according to research by Chinese scientists.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to heavy trucks, the fleet owners in China are very bottom-line driven,\u201d Doleman said.",
      "Early sales were buoyed by generous government incentives like a 2024 scheme for truck owners to trade in old vehicles. Owners can get up to about $19,000 to replace older trucks with newer or electric models.",
      "Investments in charging infrastructure are also boosting demand for electric trucks.",
      "Major logistics hubs, including in the Yangtze River Delta, have added dedicated charging stations along key freight routes. Cities like Beijing and Shanghai have built heavy-duty charging hubs along highways that can charge trucks in minutes.",
      "CATL, the world\u2019s largest maker of electric vehicle batteries, launched a time-saving battery-swapping system for heavy trucks in May and said it plans a nationwide network of swap stations covering 150,000 kilometers (about 93,000 miles) out of China's 184,000 kms (about 114,000 miles) of expressways.",
      "The surge in sales of electric trucks is cutting diesel use and could reshape future LNG demand, analysts say.",
      "Diesel consumption in China, the second-largest consumer of the fuel after the U.S., fell to 3.9 million barrels per day in June 2024, down 11% year-on-year and the largest drop since mid-2021, partly reflecting the shift to LNG and electric trucks, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.",
      "\u201cThe rise of China\u2019s electric truck sector is one of the more under-reported stories in the global energy transition, especially given its potential impact on regional diesel trade flows,\u201d said Tim Daiss of APAC Energy Consultancy.",

      "A 2020 ICCT study found LNG-fueled trucks cut emissions by 2%-9% over 100 years but can be more polluting in the short run due to leaks of methane, a potent planet-warming gas that can trap more than 80 times more heat in the atmosphere in the short term than carbon dioxide.",

      "New York City's mayor-elect, Zohran Mamdani, has quickly become a target of conservative media figures",
      "New York City's incoming mayor, Zohran Mamdani, hasn't taken office yet. But he's already the new avatar of evil for conservative media figures.",
      "He's been called \u201cdownright sinister\u201d and \u201cincompatible with America.\u201d His labels include commie, Marxist, jihadist sympathizer and \u201cseething leftist.\u201d Fox News' Laura Ingraham warned her viewers not to be fooled by \u201csmiling socialists who rule like Soviet tyrants.\u201d",
      "A New York Post post-election cover that depicted Mamdani holding aloft the Soviet Union's hammer and sickle symbol sold out on newsstands by noon and was offered on e-Bay for $75. By the end of the day, the Post was selling baby onesies and commemorative plates emblazoned with the cover.",
      "Already, conservative outlets see Mamdani joining Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton as someone guaranteed to make their audiences' blood boil. And by doing so, they can help Republicans in the midterm elections.",
      "\u201cIt's very clear that he's going to be the No. 1 target of right-wing media for the foreseeable future, well into 2026,\u201d said Howard Polskin, publisher of the Righting, a newsletter that follows conservative media. \u201cHe's colorful, controversial and not afraid of a fight.\u201d",
      "The head of an outlet that Polskin regularly monitors, the Daily Signal, said Mamdani is likely seen as a threat because his appeal to working-class Americans who feel left behind by the economy is similar to that of President Donald Trump, although they have different ideas about how to handle that.",
      "\u201cRemember years ago there was Nancy Pelosi who was the bogeyman for Republicans,\u201d said Rob Bluey, president and executive editor of the Daily Signal. \u201cI think Mamdani is probably going to be the new person. I think that\u2019s why you see a lot of emphasis on him in conservative media.\u201d",
      "In the Washington Examiner, editor-in-chief Hugo Gurdon saw ominous signs in Mamdani's election night victory speech. \u201cHe was downright sinister, glorying not just in his achievement but in having laid low his vanquished enemies and stuck it to others besides. He took off his smiling campaign mask and revealed his venomous self,\u201d Gurdon wrote.",
      "Newsmax's Rob Schmitt called Mamdani the \u201cmayor for the foreign-born. We have flooded the country with diversity, and diversity delivered us Zohran.\" In an interview, Schmitt said he wasn't quite ready to anoint Mamdani as a deliberate target for the conservative media.",
      "\u201cA go-to bogeyman makes it sound like it's manufactured,\u201d he told The Associated Press, \u201cwhereas we are just appropriately concerned about people that are spewing or trying to push an ideology that is destined to not work.\u201d",
      "The Post recognized Mamdani as a target of interest well before the election. Between Oct. 27 and Nov. 5, he was the subject of seven of the tabloid's covers. One, headlined \u201cMam-Child,\" depicted Mamdani in a little boy's overalls to illustrate a column warning that the city wasn't a toy to hand to a \u201cbaby like Zohran.\u201d Another front page blared \u201cNot Zo Fast\u201d to herald a tightening race in the polls. Election Day's lead headline was \u201cTrump to New York: Keep the Commie Out.\u201d",
      "Mamdani reached out to the White House post-election for a meeting with Trump and the president said Sunday that \u201cwe'll work something out.\u201d",
      "Mamdani\u2019s status as a member of the Democratic Socialists of America and his Muslim background are behind many of the conservative media attacks.",
      "Asked on NBC's \u201cMeet the Press\u201d this spring whether he was a communist, Mamdani said, \u201cNo, I am not.\u201d Webster's defines socialism as a political theory where the community or government owns and controls the production and distribution of goods. Communism, advanced by revolutionary Karl Marx, is considered a step beyond, where private property and capitalism no longer exist.",

He's far worse than a socialist.\u201d",
      "Some Jewish groups have expressed skepticism about Mamdani, who has supported Palestinian rights and criticized Israel's attack in Gaza as genocide. But he has denounced Hamas's Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel and said he will work to combat antisemitism.",

Podcaster Michael Savage called him a \u201cMarxist jihadist sympathizer.\u201d Influencer Laura Loomer predicted Mamdani would encourage Muslims to commit political assassinations to acquire power and silence critics.",
      "Mamdani's staff did not return messages from The Associated Press. In the waning days of his campaign, he spoke out against some of the religious-based attacks on him.",
      "\u201cI thought that if I behaved well enough or bit my tongue enough in the face or racist, baseless attacks all while returning back to my central message, it would allow me to be more than just my faith,\u201d he said. \u201cI was wrong. No amount of redirection is ever enough.\u201d",
      "Some of the attacks reflect a common theme in politics and the media \u2014 not unique to Mamdani \u2014 to associate all members of a political party with the beliefs of one who could be depicted as on the fringe. The Daily Signal wrote after his election that Mamdani \u201cis now the putative leader of his party.\u201d",

      "Carusone said he's not sure if Mamdani will become a villain of the conservative media on the level of a Clinton or Pelosi, but he can understand the urgency.",

      "Hall of Fame left-hander Randy Johnson will have his No. 51 retired by the Seattle Mariners during a pregame ceremony on May 2, 2026",
      "SEATTLE -- Hall of Fame left-hander Randy Johnson will have his No. 51 retired by the Seattle Mariners during a pregame ceremony on May 2, 2026, the club announced Thursday.",
      "In June, the Mariners said Johnson\u2019s No. 51 would become the fifth number retired by the franchise, joining Ken Griffey Jr. (No. 24), Edgar Martinez (No. 11) and Ichiro Suzuki, who had his No. 51 retired this summer. All MLB teams have retired Jackie Robinson\u2019s No. 42.",
      "Johnson went 130-74 with a 3.42 ERA across 10 seasons with the Mariners.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy that my contributions over the 10 years that I was there are being acknowledged now,\u201d the 62-year-old Johnson said via Zoom in June. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d",
      "Johnson enjoyed more success with the Arizona Diamondbacks, with whom he won four consecutive Cy Young Awards in addition to a World Series in 2001. However, the lanky left-hander nicknamed the \u201cBig Unit\u201d because of his 6-foot-10 frame fondly remembers his Seattle tenure.",
      "Johnson made his major league debut in 1988 with the Montreal Expos and was traded to Seattle in 1989. After some initial control issues with the Mariners, he found his stride with a breakout season in 1993. He went 19-8 with a 3.24 ERA that year, the first of his six 300+ strikeout seasons.",
      "The year Johnson looks back on with particular fondness is the 1995 season, during which he went 18-2 with a 2.48 ERA and won his first of five Cy Young Awards. The Mariners\u2019 future in Seattle was cast into doubt when in September of that year, King County voters rejected subsidy taxes to build a new stadium.",
      "Simultaneously, the Mariners enjoyed a prosperous season on the field at the Kingdome, which culminated in reaching the AL Championship Series before falling to Cleveland. Ultimately, the King County Council approved funding for a new stadium,",

      "Johnson was traded to the Houston Astros midway through the 1998 season and spent the remainder of his career with the Arizona Diamondbacks (1999-2004, 2007-08), New York Yankees (2005-06) and San Francisco Giants (2009).",
      "The 10-time All-Star finished his 22-year big league career with a 303-166 record, 3.29 ERA and 4,875 strikeouts, second only to Nolan Ryan\u2019s 5,714. Johnson is among just four pitchers in MLB history with at least 300 wins and 4,000 strikeouts, joined by Ryan, Roger Clemens and Steve Carlton.",
      "Johnson is second in Mariners franchise history in strikeouts and wins, as well as third in innings pitched. He was retired into the Mariners Hall of Fame in 2012, and the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2015. The Arizona Diamondbacks retired his No. 51 in 2015.",

So manager Ruben Amorim may have to deploy an attacking midfielder like Mason Mount, Matheus Cunha or Bryan Mbeumo up front \u2014 something he has done already this season \u2014 as United looks to build on its five-match unbeaten run.",
      "There was a managerial appointment during the international break, when Rob Edwards took over last-placed Wolverhampton.",
      "Edwards, who played for Wolves from 2004-08 and was born nearby, has a big job on his hands. The team has gone 15 consecutive league games without a victory, 11 this season, leaving Wolves on two points and already eight points from safety.",
      "Edwards joined from second-tier Middlesbrough and has previous Premier League experience with Luton Town, which he couldn't keep up in its one season back in the top flight. His first game as Wolves manager is at home to Crystal Palace on Saturday.",

      "Colombian scientists have recovered a cannon, three coins and a porcelain cup from the Caribbean Sea",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- A cannon, three coins and a porcelain cup were among the first objects Colombian scientists recovered from the depths of the Caribbean Sea where the mythical Spanish galleon San Jos\u00e9 sank in 1708 after being attacked by an English fleet, authorities said Thursday.",
      "The recovery is part of a scientific investigation that the government authorized last year to study the wreckage and the causes of the sinking. Colombian researchers located the galleon in 2015, leading to legal and diplomatic disputes. Its exact location is a state secret.",
      "The ship is believed to hold 11 million gold and silver coins, emeralds and other precious cargo from Spanish-controlled colonies, which could be worth billions of dollars if ever recovered.",
      "President Gustavo Petro's government has said that the purpose of the deep-water expedition is research and not the treasure\u2019s seizure.",
      "Colombia's culture ministry said in a statement Thursday that the cannon, coins and porcelain cup will undergo a conservation process at a lab dedicated to the expedition.",

      "Meta has started notifying young Australians to download their digital histories and delete their accounts from Facebook, Instagram, and Threads",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Technology giant Meta on Thursday began sending thousands of young Australians a two-week warning to downland their digital histories and delete their accounts from Facebook, Instagram and Threads before a world-first social media ban on accounts of children younger than 16 takes effect.",
      "The Australian government announced two weeks ago that the three Meta platforms plus Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube must take reasonable steps to exclude Australian account holders younger than 16, beginning Dec. 10.",
      "California-based Meta on Thursday became the first of the targeted tech companies to outline how it will comply with the law. Meta contacted thousands of young account holders via SMS and email to warn that suspected children will start to be denied access to the platforms from Dec. 4.",
      "\u201cWe will start notifying impacted teens today to give them the opportunity to save their contacts and memories,\u201d Meta said in a statement.",
      "Meta said young users could also use the notice period to update their contact information \u201cso we can get in touch and help them regain access once they turn 16.\u201d",
      "Meta has estimated there are 350,000 Australians aged 13-to-15 on Instagram and 150,000 in that age bracket on Facebook. Australia\u2019s population is 28 million.",
      "Account holders 16-years-old and older who were mistakenly given notice that they would be excluded can contact Yoti Age Verification and verify their age by providing government-issued identity documents or a \u201cvideo selfie,\u201d Meta said.",
      "Terry Flew, co-director of Sydney University\u2019s Center for AI, Trust and Governance, said such facial-recognition technology had a failure rate of at least 5%.",
      "\u201cIn the absence of a government-mandated ID system, we\u2019re always looking at second-best solutions around these things,\u201d Flew told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "The government has warned platforms that demanding that all account holders prove they are older than 15 would be an unreasonable response to the new age restrictions. The government maintains the platforms already had sufficient data about many account holders to ascertain they were not young children.",
      "Failure to take reasonable steps to exclude young children could earn platforms fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($32 million).",

      "The U.S. Border Patrol is monitoring millions of American drivers nationwide in a secretive program to identify and detain people whose travel patterns it deems suspicious",
      "The U.S. Border Patrol is monitoring millions of American drivers nationwide in a secretive program to identify and detain people whose travel patterns it deems suspicious, The Associated Press has found.",
      "The predictive intelligence program has resulted in people being stopped, searched and in some cases arrested. A network of cameras scans and records vehicle license plate information, and an algorithm flags vehicles deemed suspicious based on where they came from, where they were going and which route they took. Federal agents in turn may then flag local law enforcement.",
      "Suddenly, drivers find themselves pulled over \u2014 often for reasons cited such as speeding, failure to signal, the wrong window tint or even a dangling air freshener blocking the view. They are then aggressively questioned and searched, with no inkling that the roads they drove put them on law enforcement\u2019s radar.",
      "Once limited to policing the nation\u2019s boundaries, the Border Patrol has built a surveillance system stretching into the country\u2019s interior that can monitor ordinary Americans\u2019 daily actions and connections for anomalies instead of simply targeting wanted suspects. Started about a decade ago to fight illegal border-related activities and the trafficking of both drugs and people, it has expanded over the past five years.",
      "The Border Patrol has recently grown even more powerful through collaborations with other agencies, drawing information from license plate readers nationwide run by the Drug Enforcement Administration, private companies and, increasingly, local law enforcement programs funded through federal grants. Texas law enforcement agencies have asked Border Patrol to use facial recognition to identify drivers, documents show.",
      "This active role beyond the borders is part of the quiet transformation of its parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, into something more akin to a domestic intelligence operation. Under the Trump administration\u2019s heightened immigration enforcement efforts, CBP is now poised to get more than $2.7 billion to build out border surveillance systems such as the license plate reader program by layering in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.",
      "The result is a mass surveillance network with a particularly American focus: cars.",
      "This investigation, the first to reveal details of how the program works on America\u2019s roads, is based on interviews with eight former government officials with direct knowledge of the program who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak to the media, as well as dozens of federal, state and local officials, attorneys and privacy experts. The AP also reviewed thousands of pages of court and government documents, state grant and law enforcement data, and arrest reports.",
      "The Border Patrol has for years hidden details of its license plate reader program, trying to keep any mention of the program out of court documents and police reports, former officials say, even going so far as to propose dropping charges rather than risk revealing any details about the placement and use of their covert license plate readers. Readers are often disguised along highways in traffic safety equipment like drums and barrels.",
      "The Border Patrol has defined its own criteria for which drivers\u2019 behavior should be deemed suspicious or tied to drug or human trafficking, stopping people for anything from driving on backcountry roads, being in a rental car or making short trips to the border region. The agency\u2019s network of cameras now extends along the southern border in Texas, Arizona and California, and also monitors drivers traveling near the U.S.-Canada border.",
      "And it reaches far into the interior, impacting residents of big metropolitan areas and people driving to and from large cities such as Chicago and Detroit, as well as from Los Angeles, San Antonio, and Houston to and from the Mexican border region. In one example, AP found the agency has placed at least four cameras in the greater Phoenix area over the years, one of which was more than 120 miles (193 kilometers) from the Mexican frontier, beyond the agency\u2019s usual jurisdiction of 100 miles (161 kilometers) from a land or sea border. The AP also identified several camera locations in metropolitan Detroit, as well as one placed near the Michigan-Indiana border to capture traffic headed towards Chicago or Gary, Indiana, or other nearby destinations.",
      "Border Patrol\u2019s parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said they use license plate readers to help identify threats and disrupt criminal networks and are \"governed by a stringent, multi-layered policy framework, as well as federal law and constitutional protections, to ensure the technology is applied responsibly and for clearly defined security purposes.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor national security reasons, we do not detail the specific operational applications,\u201d the agency said. While the U.S. Border Patrol primarily operates within 100 miles of the border, it is legally allowed \u201cto operate anywhere in the United States,\u201d the agency added.",
      "While collecting license plates from cars on public roads has generally been upheld by courts, some legal scholars see the growth of large digital surveillance networks such as Border Patrol\u2019s as raising constitutional questions. Courts have started to recognize that \u201clarge-scale surveillance technology that\u2019s capturing everyone and everywhere at every time\u201d might be unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment, which protects people from unreasonable searches, said Andrew Ferguson, a law professor at George Washington University.",
      "Today, predictive surveillance is embedded into America\u2019s roadways. Mass surveillance techniques are also used in a range of other countries, from authoritarian governments such as China to, increasingly, democracies in the U.K. and Europe in the name of national security and public safety.",
      "\u201cThey are collecting mass amounts of information about who people are, where they go, what they do, and who they know \u2026 engaging in dragnet surveillance of Americans on the streets, on the highways, in their cities, in their communities,\u201d Nicole Ozer, the executive director of the Center for Constitutional Democracy at UC Law San Francisco, said in response to the AP\u2019s findings. \u201cThese surveillance systems do not make communities safer.\u201d",
      "\u2018We did everything right and had nothing to hide\u2019",
      "In February, Lorenzo Gutierrez Lugo, a driver for a small trucking company that specializes in transporting furniture, clothing and other belongings to families in Mexico, was driving south to the border city of Brownsville, Texas, carrying packages from immigrant communities in South Carolina\u2019s low country.",
      "Gutierrez Lugo was pulled over by a local police officer in Kingsville, a small Texas city near Corpus Christi that lies about 100 miles (160 kilometers) from the Mexican border. The officer, Richard Beltran, cited the truck\u2019s speed of 50 mph (80 kph) in a 45 mph (72 kph) zone as the reason for the stop.",
      "But speeding was a pretext: Border Patrol had requested the stop and said the black Dodge pickup with a white trailer could contain contraband, according to police and court records. U.S. Route 77 passes through Kingsville, a route that state and federal authorities scrutinize for trafficking of drugs, money and people.",
      "Gutierrez Lugo, who through a lawyer declined to comment, was interrogated about the route he drove, based on license plate reader data, per the police report and court records. He consented to a search of his car by Beltran and Border Patrol agents, who eventually arrived to assist.",
      "They unearthed no contraband. But Beltran arrested Gutierrez Lugo on suspicion of money laundering and engaging in organized criminal activity because he was carrying thousands of dollars in cash \u2014 money his supervisor said came directly from customers in local Latino communities, who are accustomed to paying in cash. No criminal charges were ultimately brought against Gutierrez Lugo and an effort by prosecutors to seize the cash, vehicle and trailer as contraband was eventually dropped.",
      "Luis Barrios owns the trucking company, Paqueter\u00eda El Guero, that employed the driver. He told AP he hires people with work authorization in the United States and was taken aback by the treatment of his employee and his trailer.",
      "\u201cWe did everything right and had nothing to hide, and that was ultimately what they found,\u201d said Barrios, who estimates he spent $20,000 in legal fees to clear his driver\u2019s name and get the trailer out of impound.",
      "Border Patrol agents and local police have many names for these kinds of stops: \u201cwhisper,\u201d \u201cintel\u201d or \u201cwall\u201d stops. Those stops are meant to conceal \u2014 or wall off \u2014 that the true reason for the stop is a tip from federal agents sitting miles away, watching data feeds showing who\u2019s traveling on America\u2019s roads and predicting who is \u201csuspicious,\u201d according to documents and people interviewed by the AP.",
      "In 2022, a man from Houston had his car searched from top to bottom by Texas sheriff\u2019s deputies outside San Antonio after they got a similar tipoff from Border Patrol agents about the driver, Alek Schott.",
      "Federal agents observed that Schott had made an overnight trip from Houston to Carrizo Springs, Texas, and back, court records show. They knew he stayed overnight in a hotel about 80 miles (129 kilometers) from the U.S.-Mexico border. They knew that in the morning Schott met a female colleague there before they drove together to a business meeting.",
      "At Border Patrol\u2019s request, Schott was pulled over by Bexar County sheriff\u2019s deputies. The deputies held Schott by the side of the road for more than an hour, searched his car and found nothing.",
      "\u201cThe beautiful thing about the Texas Traffic Code is there\u2019s thousands of things you can stop a vehicle for,\u201d said Joel Babb, the sheriff\u2019s deputy who stopped Schott\u2019s car, in a deposition in a lawsuit Schott filed alleging violations of his constitutional rights.",
      "According to testimony and documents released as part of Schott\u2019s lawsuit, Babb was on a group chat with federal agents called Northwest Highway. Babb deleted the WhatsApp chat off his phone but Schott\u2019s lawyers were able to recover some of the text messages.",
      "Through a public records act request, the AP also obtained more than 70 pages of the Northwest Highway group chats from June and July of this year from a Texas county that had at least one sheriff\u2019s deputy active in the chat. The AP was able to associate numerous phone numbers in both sets of documents with Border Patrol agents and Texas law enforcement officials.",
      "The chat logs show Border Patrol agents and Texas sheriffs deputies trading tips about vehicles\u2019 travel patterns \u2014 based on suspicions about little more than someone taking a quick trip to the border region and back. The chats show how thoroughly Texas highways are surveilled by this federal-local partnership and how much detailed information is informally shared.",
      "In one exchange a law enforcement official included a photo of someone\u2019s driver\u2019s license and told the group the person, who they identified using an abbreviation for someone in the country illegally, was headed westbound. \u201cNeed BP?,\u201d responded a group member whose number was labeled \u201cbp Intel.\u201d \u201cYes sir,\u201d the official answered, and a Border Patrol agent was en route.",
      "Border Patrol agents and local law enforcement shared information about U.S. citizens\u2019 social media profiles and home addresses with each other after stopping them on the road. Chats show Border Patrol was also able to determine whether vehicles were rentals and whether drivers worked for rideshare services.",
      "In Schott\u2019s case, Babb testified that federal agents \u201cactually watch travel patterns on the highway\u201d through license plate scans and other surveillance technologies. He added: \u201cI just know that they have a lot of toys over there on the federal side.\u201d",
      "After finding nothing in Schott\u2019s car, Babb said \u201cnine times out of 10, this is what happens,\u201d a phrase Schott\u2019s lawyers claimed in court filings shows the sheriff\u2019s department finds nothing suspicious in most of its searches. Babb did not respond to multiple requests for comment from AP.",
      "The Bexar County sheriff\u2019s office declined to comment due to pending litigation and referred all questions about the Schott case to the county\u2019s district attorney. The district attorney did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "\u2018Patterns of life\u2019 and license plates",
      "Today, the deserts, forests and mountains of the nation\u2019s land borders are dotted with checkpoints and increasingly, surveillance towers, Predator drones, thermal cameras and license plate readers, both covert and overt.",
      "Border Patrol's parent agency got authorization to run a domestic license plate reader program in 2017, according to a Department of Homeland Security policy document. At the time, the agency said that it might use hidden license plate readers \u201dfor a set period of time while CBP is conducting an investigation of an area of interest or smuggling route. Once the investigation is complete, or the illicit activity has stopped in that area, the covert cameras are removed,\u201d the document states.",
      "But that\u2019s not how the program has operated in practice, according to interviews, police reports and court documents. License plate readers have become a major \u2014 and in some places permanent \u2014 fixture of the border region.",
      "In a budget request to Congress in fiscal year 2024, CBP said that its Conveyance Monitoring and Predictive Recognition System, or CMPRS, \u201ccollects license plate images and matches the processed images against established hot lists to assist \u2026 in identifying travel patterns indicative of illegal border related activities.\u201d Several new developer jobs have been posted seeking applicants to help modernize its license plate surveillance system in recent months. Numerous Border Patrol sectors now have special intelligence units that can analyze license plate reader data, and tie commercial license plate readers to its national network, according to documents and interviews.",
      "Border Patrol worked with other law enforcement agencies in Southern California about a decade ago to develop pattern recognition, said a former CBP official who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. Over time, the agency learned to develop what it calls \u201cpatterns of life\u201d of vehicle movements by sifting through the license plate data and determining \u201cabnormal\u201d routes, evaluating if drivers were purposely avoiding official checkpoints. Some cameras can take photos of a vehicle\u2019s plates as well as its driver\u2019s face, the official said.",
      "Another former Border Patrol official compared it to a more technologically sophisticated version of what agents used to do in the field \u2014 develop hunches based on experience about which vehicles or routes smugglers might use, find a legal basis for the stop like speeding and pull drivers over for questioning.",
      "The cameras take pictures of vehicle license plates. Then, the photos are \u201cread\u201d by the system, which automatically detects and distills the images into numbers and letters, tied to a geographic location, former CBP officials said. The AP could not determine how precisely the system's algorithm defines a quick turnaround or an odd route. Over time, the agency has amassed databases replete with images of license plates, and the system\u2019s algorithm can flag an unusual \u201cpattern of life\u201d for human inspection.",
      "The Border Patrol also has access to a nationwide network of plate readers run by the Drug Enforcement Administration, documents show, and was authorized in 2020 to access license plate reader systems sold by private companies. In documents obtained by the AP, a Border Patrol official boasted about being able to see that a vehicle that had traveled to \u201cDallas, Little Rock, Arkansas and Atlanta\u201d before ending up south of San Antonio.",
      "Documents show that Border Patrol or CBP has in the past had access to data from at least three private sector vendors: Rekor, Vigilant Solutions and Flock Safety.",
      "Through Flock alone, Border Patrol for a time had access to at least 1,600 license plate readers across 22 states, and some counties have reported looking up license plates on behalf of CBP even in states like California and Illinois that ban sharing data with federal immigration authorities, according to an AP analysis of police disclosures. A Flock spokesperson told AP the company \u201cfor now\u201d had paused its pilot programs with CBP and a separate DHS agency, Homeland Security Investigations, and declined to discuss the type or volume of data shared with either federal agency, other than to say agencies could search for vehicles wanted in conjunction with a crime. No agencies currently list Border Patrol as receiving Flock data. Vigilant and Rekor did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Where Border Patrol places its cameras is a closely guarded secret. However, through public records requests, the AP obtained dozens of permits the agency filed with Arizona and Michigan for permission to place cameras on state-owned land. The permits show the agency frequently disguises its cameras by concealing them in traffic equipment like the yellow and orange barrels that dot American roadways, or by labeling them as jobsite equipment. An AP photographer in October visited the locations identified in more than two dozen permit applications in Arizona, finding that most of the Border Patrol\u2019s hidden equipment remains in place today. Spokespeople for the Arizona and Michigan departments of transportation said they approve permits based on whether they follow state and federal rules and are not privy to details on how license plate readers are used.",
      "Texas, California, and other border states did not provide documents in response to the AP\u2019s public records requests.",
      "CBP\u2019s attorneys and personnel instructed local cities and counties in both Arizona and Texas to withhold records from the AP that might have revealed details about the program\u2019s operations, even though they were requested under state open records laws, according to emails and legal briefs filed with state governments. For example, CBP claimed records requested by the AP in Texas \u201cwould permit private citizens to anticipate weaknesses in a police department, avoid detection, jeopardize officer safety, and generally undermine police efforts.\u201d Michigan redacted the exact locations of Border Patrol equipment, but the AP was able to determine general locations from the name of the county.",
      "One page of the group chats obtained by the AP shows that a participant enabled WhatsApp\u2019s disappearing messages feature to ensure communications were deleted automatically.",
      "Transformation of CBP into intelligence agency",
      "The Border Patrol\u2019s license plate reader program is just one part of a steady transformation of its parent agency, CBP, in the years since 9/11 into an intelligence operation whose reach extends far beyond borders, according to interviews with former officials.",
      "CBP has quietly amassed access to far more information from ports of entry, airports and intelligence centers than other local, state and federal law enforcement agencies. And like a domestic spy agency, CBP has mostly hidden its role in the dissemination of intelligence on purely domestic travel through its use of whisper stops.",
      "Border Patrol has also extended the reach of its license plate surveillance program by paying for local law enforcement to run plate readers on their behalf.",
      "A federal grant program called Operation Stonegarden, which has existed in some form for nearly two decades, has handed out hundreds of millions of dollars to buy automated license plate readers, camera-equipped drones and other surveillance gear for local police and sheriffs agencies. Stonegarden grant funds also pay for local law enforcement overtime, which deputizes local officers to work on Border Patrol enforcement priorities. Under President Donald Trump, the Republican-led Congress this year allocated $450 million for Stonegarden to be handed out over the next four fiscal years. In the previous four fiscal years, the program gave out $342 million.",
      "In Cochise County, Arizona, Sheriff Mark Dannels said Stonegarden grants, which have been used to buy plate readers and pay for overtime, have let his deputies merge their mission with Border Patrol\u2019s to prioritize border security.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re sharing our authorities, we can put some consequences behind, or deterrence behind, \u2018Don\u2019t come here,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "In 2021, the Ward County, Texas, sheriff sought grant funding from DHS to buy a \u201ccovert, mobile, License Plate Reader\u201d to pipe data to Border Patrol\u2019s Big Bend Sector Intelligence Unit. The sheriff's department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Other documents AP obtained show that Border Patrol connects locally owned and operated license plate readers bought through Stonegarden grants to its computer systems, vastly increasing the federal agency\u2019s surveillance network.",
      "How many people have been caught up in the Border Patrol\u2019s dragnet is unknown. One former Border Patrol agent who worked on the license plate reader pattern detection program in California said the program had an 85% success rate of discovering contraband once he learned to identify patterns that looked suspicious. But another former official in a different Border Patrol sector said he was unaware of successful interdictions based solely on license plate patterns.",
      "In Trump\u2019s second term, Border Patrol has extended its reach and power as border crossings have slowed to historic lows and freed up agents for operations in the heartland. Border Patrol Sector Chief Gregory Bovino, for example, was tapped to direct hundreds of agents from multiple DHS agencies in the administration\u2019s immigration sweeps across Los Angeles, more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) from his office in El Centro, California. Bovino later was elevated to lead the aggressive immigration crackdown in Chicago. Numerous Border Patrol officials have also been tapped to replace ICE leadership.",
      "The result has been more encounters between the agency and the general public than ever before.",
      "\u201cWe took Alek\u2019s case because it was a clear-cut example of an unconstitutional traffic stop,\u201d said Christie Hebert, who works at the nonprofit public interest law firm Institute for Justice and represents Schott. \u201dWhat we found was something much larger \u2014 a system of mass surveillance that threatens people\u2019s freedom of movement.\u201d",
      "AP found numerous other examples similar to what Schott and the delivery driver experienced in reviewing court records in border communities and along known smuggling routes in Texas and California. Several police reports and court records the AP examined cite \u201csuspicious\u201d travel patterns or vague tipoffs from the Border Patrol or other unnamed law enforcement agencies. In another federal court document filed in California, a Border Patrol agent acknowledged \u201cconducting targeted analysis on vehicles exhibiting suspicious travel patterns\u201d as the reason he singled out a Nissan Altima traveling near San Diego.",
      "In cases reviewed by the AP, local law enforcement sometimes tried to conceal the role the Border Patrol plays in passing along intelligence. Babb, the deputy who stopped Schott, testified he typically uses the phrase \u201csubsequent to prior knowledge\u201d when describing whisper stops in his police reports to acknowledge that the tip came from another law enforcement agency without revealing too much in written documents he writes memorializing motorist encounters.",
      "Once they pull over a vehicle deemed suspicious, officers often aggressively question drivers about their travels, their belongings, their jobs, how they know the passengers in the car, and much more, police records and bodyworn camera footage obtained by the AP show. One Texas officer demanded details from a man about where he met his current sexual partner. Often drivers, such as the one working for the South Carolina moving company, were arrested on suspicion of money laundering merely for carrying a few thousand dollars worth of cash, with no apparent connection to illegal activity. Prosecutors filed lawsuits to try to seize money or vehicles on the suspicion they were linked to trafficking.",
      "Schott warns that for every success story touted by Border Patrol, there are far more innocent people who don\u2019t realize they\u2019ve become ensnared in a technology-driven enforcement operation.",
      "\u201cI assume for every one person like me, who\u2019s actually standing up, there\u2019s a thousand people who just don\u2019t have the means or the time or, you know, they just leave frustrated and angry. They don\u2019t have the ability to move forward and hold anyone accountable,\u201d Schott said. \u201cI think there\u2019s thousands of people getting treated this way.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Sometimes our immune system runs amok and attacks the organ that makes us \u201cus\u201d \u2014 the brain",
      "\u201cMy year of unraveling\u201d is how a despairing Christy Morrill described nightmarish months when his immune system hijacked his brain.",
      "What\u2019s called autoimmune encephalitis attacks the organ that makes us \u201cus,\u201d and it can appear out of the blue.",
      "Morrill went for a bike ride with friends along the California coast, stopping for lunch, and they noticed nothing wrong. Neither did Morrill until his wife asked how it went \u2014 and he'd forgotten. Morrill would get worse before he got better. \u201cUnhinged\u201d and \u201cfighting to see light,\u201d he wrote as delusions set in and holes in his memory grew.",
      "Of all the ways our immune system can run amok and damage the body instead of protecting it, autoimmune encephalitis is one of the most unfathomable. Seemingly healthy people abruptly spiral with confusion, memory loss, seizures, even psychosis.",
      "But doctors are getting better at identifying it, thanks to discoveries of a growing list of the rogue antibodies responsible that, if found in blood and spinal fluid, aid diagnosis. Every year new culprit antibodies are being uncovered, said Dr. Sam Horng, a neurologist at Mount Sinai Health System in New York who has cared for patients with multiple forms of this mysterious disease.",
      "And while treatment today involves general ways to fight the inflammation, two major clinical trials are underway aiming for more targeted therapy.",
      "Still, it's tricky. Symptoms can be mistaken for psychiatric or other neurologic disorders, delaying proper treatment.",
      "\u201cWhen someone\u2019s having new changes in their mental status, they\u2019re worsening and if there\u2019s sort of like a bizarre quality to it, that\u2019s something that kind of tips our suspicion,\u201d Horng said. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to miss a treatable condition.\u201d",
      "With early diagnosis and care, some patients fully recover. Others like Morrill recover normal daily functioning but grapple with some lasting damage \u2014 in his case, lost decades of \u201cautobiographical\u201d memories. This 72-year-old literature major can still spout facts and figures learned long ago, and he makes new memories every day. But even family photos can\u2019t help him recall pivotal moments in his own life.",
      "\u201cI remember \u2018Ulysses\u2019 is published in Paris in 1922 at Sylvia Beach\u2019s bookstore. Why do I remember that, which is of no use to me anymore, and yet I can\u2019t remember my son\u2019s wedding?\u201d Morrill wonders.",
      "Encephalitis means the brain is inflamed and symptoms can vary from mild to life-threatening. Infections are a common cause, typically requiring treatment of the underlying virus or bacteria. But when that's ruled out, an autoimmune cause has to be considered, Horng said, especially when symptoms arise suddenly.",
      "The umbrella term autoimmune encephalitis covers a group of diseases with weird-sounding names based on the antibody fueling it, such as anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.",
      "While they're not new diseases, that one got a name in 2007 when Dr. Josep Dalmau, then at the University of Pennsylvania, discovered the first culprit antibody, sparking a hunt for more.",
      "That anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis tends to strike younger women and, one of the bizarre factors, it\u2019s sometimes triggered by an ovarian \u201cdermoid\u201d cyst.",
      "How? That type of cyst has similarities to some brain tissue, Horng explained. The immune system can develop antibodies recognizing certain proteins from the growth. If those antibodies get into the brain, they can mistakenly target NMDA receptors on healthy brain cells, sparking personality and behavior changes that can include hallucinations.",
      "Different antibodies create different problems depending if they mostly hit memory and mood areas in the brain, or sensory and movement regions.",
      "Altogether, \u201cfacets of personhood seem to be impaired,\" Horng said.",
      "Therapies include filtering harmful antibodies out of patients' blood, infusing healthy ones, and high-dose steroids to calm inflammation.",
      "Those cyst-related antibodies stealthily attacked Kiara Alexander in Charlotte, North Carolina, who\u2019d never heard of the brain illness. She\u2019d brushed off some oddities \u2014 a little forgetfulness, zoning out a few minutes \u2014 until she found herself in an ambulance because of a seizure.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s very unusual, I mean extremely unusual, to just complain of a problem with autobiographical memory,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cOne has to think about unusual disorders.\u201d",

      "They\u2019re cute, even cuddly, and promise learning and companionship \u2014 but artificial intelligence toys are not safe for kids, according to children\u2019s and consumer advocacy groups urging parents not to buy them during the holiday season.",
      "These toys, marketed to kids as young as 2 years old, are generally powered by AI models that have already been shown to harm children and teenagers, such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, according to an advisory published Thursday by the children\u2019s advocacy group Fairplay and signed by more than 150 organizations and individual experts such as child psychiatrists and educators.",
      "\u201cThe serious harms that AI chatbots have inflicted on children are well-documented, including fostering obsessive use, having explicit sexual conversations, and encouraging unsafe behaviors, violence against others, and self-harm,\u201d Fairplay said.",
      "AI toys, made by companies such as Curio Interactive and Keyi Technologies, are often marketed as educational, but Fairplay says they can displace important creative and learning activities. They promise friendship but also disrupt children\u2019s relationships and resilience, the group said.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s different about young children is that their brains are being wired for the first time and developmentally it is natural for them to be trustful, for them to seek relationships with kind and friendly characters,\u201d said Rachel Franz, director of Fairplay\u2019s Young Children Thrive Offline Program. Because of this, she added, the amount of trust young children are putting in these toys can exacerbate the harms seen with older children.",
      "Fairplay, a 25-year-old organization formerly known as the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, has been warning about AI toys for more than 10 years. They just weren\u2019t as advanced as they are today. A decade ago, during an emerging fad of internet-connected toys and AI speech recognition, the group helped lead a backlash against Mattel\u2019s talking Hello Barbie doll that it said was recording and analyzing children\u2019s conversations.",
      "\u201cEverything has been released with no regulation and no research, so it gives us extra pause when all of a sudden we see more and more manufacturers, including Mattel, who recently partnered with OpenAI, potentially putting out these products,\u201d Franz said.",
      "It\u2019s the second big seasonal warning against AI toys since consumer advocates at U.S. PIRG last week called out the trend in its annual \u201c Trouble in Toyland \u201d report that typically looks at a range of product hazards, such as high-powered magnets and button-sized batteries that young children can swallow. This year, the organization tested four toys that use AI chatbots.",
      "\u201cWe found some of these toys will talk in-depth about sexually explicit topics, will offer advice on where a child can find matches or knives, act dismayed when you say you have to leave, and have limited or no parental controls,\u201d the report said.",
      "Dr. Dana Suskind, a pediatric surgeon and social scientist who studies early brain development, said young children don't have the conceptual tools to understand what an AI companion is. While kids have always bonded with toys through imaginative play, when they do this they use their imagination to create both sides of a pretend conversation, \u201cpracticing creativity, language, and problem-solving,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cAn AI toy collapses that work. It answers instantly, smoothly, and often better than a human would. We don\u2019t yet know the developmental consequences of outsourcing that imaginative labor to an artificial agent\u2014but it\u2019s very plausible that it undercuts the kind of creativity and executive function that traditional pretend play builds,\u201d Suskind said.",

      "Another company, Miko, said it uses its own conversational AI model rather than relying on general large language model systems such as ChatGPT in order to make its product \u2014 an interactive AI robot \u2014 safe for children.",

AI toys often do that thinking for them,\" she said. \u201cHere\u2019s the brutal irony: when parents ask me how to prepare their child for an AI world, unlimited AI access is actually the worst preparation possible.\u201d",

      "GARDEN GROVE, Calif. -- An interactive museum dedicated to the Shroud of Turin, which some say was Jesus\u2019 burial cloth, opens its doors to the public Wednesday at the Christ Cathedral campus in Southern California.",
      "\u201cThe Shroud of Turin: An Immersive Experience,\u201d a $5-million exhibit in Garden Grove featuring 360-degree projection room theaters, Shroud of Turin replicas, interactive kiosks, and a life-size sculpture of Christ, was conceived over a span of three years and funded through private donations.",
      "The content was created primarily by Othonia, Inc., a Rome-based group dedicated to the examination of the shroud, one of the most studied artifacts in history. The original \u2014 a 14-foot-long, 3.5-foot-wide (4.3-meter-long, 1 meter-wide) cloth \u2014 is kept in a bulletproof, climate-controlled case housed in the Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist in Turin, Italy.",
      "The California museum \u2014 covering 10,000 square feet (930 square meters) \u2014 contains a life-size laminated visual of the shroud stretched over a wall. It shows the faint image of a man with wounds similar to those of Christ.",
      "The Vatican has called the cloth a powerful symbol of Christ\u2019s suffering while making no claim to its authenticity. Many experts stand by carbon-dating of scraps of the cloth that put it in the 13th or 14th century, but many faithful \u2014 some accomplished scientists among them \u2014 say the results might have been skewed by contamination, calling for larger samples to be analyzed. Many insist that the cloth contains pollen from Jerusalem and is woven in a pattern that was unique to the first century.",
      "The cloth, considered a relic by many Christians, was most recently on display in the spring of 2015. While the shroud may never leave Turin, the new exhibit will remain at least through 2030 on the Christ Cathedral campus, next to the famous glass tower and sanctuary erected by televangelist Robert H. Schuller that is now home to the Catholic Diocese of Orange.",
      "The Most Rev. Timothy Freyer, an auxiliary bishop at the diocese, said he hopes the exhibit will reinforce for visitors the power of God\u2019s love for all.",
      "\u201cMy hope is that people of faith will have stronger faith, people who are doubting will come to belief and people with no faith will begin the questioning process and then come to faith,\u201d he said.",
      "One of the highlights of the immersive experience is a re-creation of Christ\u2019s resurrection on Easter morning, with museum visitors sitting in the tomb and watching the shrouded body disappear in a flash of light. The exhibit also features replicas of the spear believed to have pierced Christ\u2019s chest and the helmet of thorns placed on his head.",
      "Philip Rizzo, a parishioner at St. Bonaventure Catholic Church in Huntington Beach who was part of a group that got a preview, said seeing these items up close created a powerful visual representation of Christ\u2019s suffering and sacrifice. Also, he said, witnessing the extensive scientific research conducted on the cloth makes the artifact more relatable.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re tangible beings, not just spirit and light,\u201d Rizzo said. \u201cScience really helps make that connection.\u201d",
      "While some scientists have criticized the eagerness of Christians to authenticate the cloth, the new exhibit had its origins in such curiosity. Its main proponent was August Accetta, a gynecologist who opened up the Shroud Center of Southern California in 1998 and has studied the cloth's mystery for over three decades.",
      "Accetta said it was the Shroud of Turin that converted him from agnostic to Catholic. His Shroud fascination continued after meeting John Jackson, a nuclear physicist, who in 1978 led a 40-person team of scientists as part of the Shroud of Turin Research Project. Their study determined that the cloth was not a manufactured work of art, but contained human bloodstains and that no known physical, chemical or biological process could adequately explain how the image on the Shroud was formed.",
      "Accetta believes, as some other scientists do, that the image was created by a burst of radiation and that a massive amount of energy is required to create the image without burning the cloth.",
      "\u201cOn the shroud, you see four centimeters of anatomically correct information encoded in two microns, which is about half the thickness of a strand of hair,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t even begin to understand that, let alone reproduce it.\u201d",
      "To him, the only explanation \u2014 as the interactive exhibit illustrates \u2014 is that the body of Christ became light and the shroud simply collapsed, leaving the fine imprint of his face on the white linen.",

      "For technology adopters looking for the next big thing, \u201cagentic AI\u201d is the future. At least, that's what the marketing pitches and tech industry T-shirts say.",
      "What makes an artificial intelligence product \u201cagentic\u201d depends on who's selling it. But the promise is usually that it's a step beyond today's generative AI chatbots.",
      "Chatbots, however useful, are all talk and no action. They can answer questions, retrieve and summarize information, write papers and generate images, music, video and lines of code. AI agents, by contrast, are supposed to be able to take actions on a person's behalf.",
      "But if you're confused, you're not alone. Google searches for \u201cagentic\u201d have skyrocketed from near obscurity a year ago to a peak earlier this fall.",
      "A new report Tuesday by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Boston Consulting Group, who surveyed more than 2,000 business executives around the world, describes agentic AI as a \u201cnew class of systems\u201d that \u201ccan plan, act, and learn on their own.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are not just tools to be operated or assistants waiting for instructions,\u201d says the MIT Sloan Management Review report. \"Increasingly, they behave like autonomous teammates, capable of executing multistep processes and adapting as they go.\u201d",
      "AI chatbots \u2014 such as the original ChatGPT that debuted three years ago this month \u2014 rely on systems called large language models that predict the next word in a sentence based on the huge trove of human writings they've been trained on. They can sound remarkably human, especially when given a voice, but are effectively performing a kind of word completion.",
      "That's different from what AI developers \u2014 including ChatGPT's maker, OpenAI, and tech giants like Amazon, Google, IBM, Microsoft and Salesforce \u2014 have in mind for AI agents.",
      "\u201cA generative AI-based chatbot will say, \u2018Here are the great ideas\u2019 \u2026 and then be done,\u201d said Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of Agentic AI at Amazon Web Services, in an interview this week. \u201cIt\u2019s useful, but what makes things agentic is that it goes beyond what a chatbot does.\u201d",
      "Sivasubramanian, a longtime Amazon employee, took on his new role helping to lead work on AI agents in Amazon's cloud computing division earlier this year. He sees great promise in AI systems that can be given a \u201chigh-level goal\u201d and break it down into a series of steps and act upon them. \u201cI truly believe agentic AI is going to be one of the biggest transformations since the beginning of the cloud,\u201d he said.",
      "For most consumers, the first encounters with AI agents could be in realms like online shopping. Set a budget and some preferences and AI agents can buy things or arrange travel bookings using your credit card. In the longer run, the hope is that they can do more complex tasks with access to your computer and a set of guidelines to follow.",

      "Dietterich has some quibbles with certain companies using \u201cagentic\u201d to describe \u201cany action a computer might do, including just looking things up on the web,\u201d but he has no doubt that the technology has immense possibilities as AI systems are given the \u201cfreedom and responsibility\u201d to refine goals and respond to changing conditions as they work on people's behalf.",

Previously, the word describing something that has agency was mostly found in other academic fields, such as psychology or chemistry.",
      "But computer scientists have been debating what an agent is for as long as Tambe has been studying them.",
      "In the 1990s, \u201cpeople agreed that some software appeared more like an agent, and some felt less like an agent, and there was not a perfect dividing line,\u201d said Tambe, a professor at Harvard University. \u201cNonetheless, it seemed useful to use the word \u2018agent\u2019 to describe software or robotic entities acting autonomously in an environment, sensing the environment, reacting to it, planning, thinking.\u201d",
      "The prominent AI researcher Andrew Ng, co-founder of online learning company Coursera, helped advocate for popularizing the adjective \u201cagentic\u201d more than a year ago to encompass a broader spectrum of AI tasks. At the time, he also appreciated that mainly \u201ctechnical people\u201d were describing it that way.",

      "Hawaii officials, for example, are giving away 1,000 dashboard cameras as they try to reverse a recent spike in traffic fatalities. The cameras will use AI to automate inspections of guardrails, road signs and pavement markings, instantly discerning between minor problems and emergencies that warrant sending a maintenance crew.",

      "After San Jose, California, started mounting cameras on street sweepers, city staff confirmed the system correctly identified potholes 97% of the time. Now they're expanding the effort to parking enforcement vehicles.",
      "Texas, where there are more roadway lane miles than the next two states combined, is less than a year into a massive AI plan that uses cameras as well as cellphone data from drivers who enroll to improve safety.",

      "Hawaii drivers over the next few weeks will be able to sign up for a free dashcam valued at $499 under the \u201cEyes on the Road\u201d campaign, which was piloted on service vehicles in 2021 before being paused due to wildfires.",
      "Roger Chen, a University of Hawaii associate professor of engineering who is helping facilitate the program, said the state faces unique challenges in maintaining its outdated roadway infrastructure.",
      "\u201cEquipment has to be shipped to the island,\u201d Chen said. \u201cThere\u2019s a space constraint and a topography constraint they have to deal with, so it\u2019s not an easy problem.\u201d",
      "Although the program also monitors such things as street debris and faded paint on lane lines, the companies behind the technology particularly tout its ability to detect damaged guardrails.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re analyzing all guardrails in their state, every single day,\u201d said Mark Pittman, CEO of Blyncsy, which combines the dashboard feeds with mapping software to analyze road conditions.",
      "Hawaii transportation officials are well aware of the risks that can stem from broken guardrails. Last year, the state reached a $3.9 million settlement with the family of a driver who was killed in 2020 after slamming into a guardrail that had been damaged in a crash 18 months earlier but never repaired.",
      "In October, Hawaii recorded its 106th traffic fatality of 2025 \u2014 more than all of 2024. It's unclear how many of the deaths were related to road problems, but Chen said the grim trend underscores the timeliness of the dashboard program.",

      "Utilities are producing eye-popping forecasts about the amount of electricity they'll need to power massive new data centers that are feeding the fast-growing AI economy",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- The forecasts are eye-popping: utilities saying they'll need two or three times more electricity within a few years to power massive new data centers that are feeding a fast-growing AI economy.",
      "But the challenges \u2014 some say the impossibility \u2014 of building new power plants to meet that demand so quickly has set off alarm bells for lawmakers, policymakers and regulators who wonder if those utility forecasts can be trusted.",
      "One burning question is whether the forecasts are based on data center projects that may never get built \u2014 eliciting concern that regular ratepayers could be stuck with the bill to build unnecessary power plants and grid infrastructure at a cost of billions of dollars.",
      "The scrutiny comes as analysts warn of the risk of an artificial intelligence investment bubble that's ballooned tech stock prices and could burst.",
      "Meanwhile, consumer advocates are finding that ratepayers in some areas \u2014 such as the mid-Atlantic electricity grid, which encompasses all or parts of 13 states stretching from New Jersey to Illinois, as well as Washington, D.C. \u2014 are already underwriting the cost to supply power to data centers, some of them built, some not.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s speculation in there,\u201d said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid territory. \u201cNobody really knows. Nobody has been looking carefully enough at the forecast to know what\u2019s speculative, what\u2019s double-counting, what\u2019s real, what\u2019s not.\u201d",
      "There is no standard practice across grids or for utilities to vet such massive projects, and figuring out a solution has become a hot topic, utilities and grid operators say.",
      "Uncertainty around forecasts is typically traced to a couple of things.",
      "One concerns developers seeking a grid connection, but whose plans aren't set in stone or lack the heft \u2014 clients, financing or otherwise \u2014 to bring the project to completion, industry and regulatory officials say.",
      "Another is data center developers submitting grid connection requests in various separate utility territories, PJM Interconnection, which operates the mid-Atlantic grid, and Texas lawmakers have found.",
      "Often, developers, for competitive reasons, won't tell utilities if or where they've submitted other requests for electricity, PJM said. That means a single project could inflate the energy forecasts of multiple utilities.",
      "The effort to improve forecasts got a high-profile boost in September, when a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission member asked the nation\u2019s grid operators for information on how they determine that a project is not only viable, but will use the electricity it says it needs.",
      "\u201cBetter data, better decision-making, better and faster decisions mean we can get all these projects, all this infrastructure built,\u201d the commissioner, David Rosner, said in an interview.",

      "In Texas, which is attracting large data center projects, lawmakers still haunted by a blackout during a deadly 2021 winter storm were shocked when told in 2024 by the grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, that its peak demand could nearly double by 2030.",
      "They found that state utility regulators lacked the tools to determine whether that was realistic.",
      "Texas state Sen. Phil King told a hearing earlier this year that the grid operator, utility regulators and utilities weren\u2019t sure if the power requests \u201care real or just speculative or somewhere in between.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers passed legislation sponsored by King, now law, that requires data center developers to disclose whether they have requests for electricity elsewhere in Texas and to set standards for developers to show that they have a substantial financial commitment to a site.",

      "The data center projects counted in the forecast are backed by contracts with financial commitments often reaching tens of millions of dollars, PPL said.",

    "story": [
      "The plan includes items that could be painful for Ukraine to accept.",
      "The Trump administration's 28-point draft proposal to finally end Russia's invasion into Ukraine would require Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's government to make significant concessions -- but also includes NATO-style security guarantees for Ukraine, according to a senior U.S. official.",
      "The plan, which is still a draft and could change, was presented in Kyiv earlier Thursday.\u00a0(See the full draft below)",
      "The plan was drafted by Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff with input from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the White House press secretary and a senior U.S. administration official confirmed Thursday.",
      "The plan would force Kyiv to give up additional territory in the east, cap the size of its military and agree it will never join NATO, among a number of other items that will be painful for the war-torn country to swallow.",
      "Even though the Trump administration plan calls for significant concessions from Ukraine, one of the security guarantees that will be provided to Ukraine is modeled on the principles of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. Under the proposed plan, the U.S. and European allies would view an attack on\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0as an attack on the \"transatlantic community,\"\u00a0according to a senior U.S. administration official.",
      "Axios first reported details of the draft plan.",
      "Officially, the 28-point peace plan notes that \"Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees.\"",
      "The senior\u00a0official confirmed that one of those security guarantees is a NATO-style security guarantee, which means the U.S. and its allies could respond with military force if Russia attacks Ukraine in the future.",
      "That could be seen as a huge, unprecedented win for Ukraine and Zelenskyy, who has, for years, sought long-term, collective defense protection from NATO allies.",
      "The plan was presented to Zelenskky on Thursday, the U.S. official said.",
      "\"This plan was drawn up immediately following discussions with one of the most senior members of President Zelensky's administration, Rustem Umerov, who agreed to the majority of the plan, after making several modifications, and presented it to President Zelensky,\"\u00a0the senior U.S. administration official said to ABC News.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement provided to ABC News that the plan reflects the complex situation and that both Russia and Ukraine will gain more than they will give.",
      "\"As the Trump Administration has clearly said, any deal must provide full security guarantees and deterrence for Ukraine, Europe, and Russia to ensure the end of the war, in addition to financial opportunities for Ukraine to rebuild, and for Russia to rejoin the global economy, to benefit the people in both countries,\" Leavitt said in the statement. \"This plan was crafted to reflect the realities of the situation...to find the best win-win scenario, where both parties gain more than they must give.\"",
      "In his evening address on Thursday, Zelenskyy said he had a \"very serious conversation\" with U.S. officials who laid out what he called a \"vision\" for ending the war.",
      "In his remarks, Zelenskyy reiterated that Ukraine needs a real peace that won't be broken.",
      "\"I outlined what is fundamentally important for us. And we agreed that the teams will work on these proposals \u2013 so that it is real,\" Zelenkskyy said in his address. \"We will not make harsh statements and are committed to clear, honest work \u2013 Ukraine, the United States and our friends and partners in Europe and the world.\"",
      "The full plan, according to a draft obtained by ABC News:",

      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine planned to meet with Nigeria\u2019s national security adviser on Thursday evening, following President Donald Trump's threats to send U.S. troops into the country with \"guns-a-blazing\" to \"wipe out the Islamic Terrorists\" he said were killing Christians.",
      "The meeting, confirmed by two defense officials, was not included on Hegseth or Caine\u2019s public schedules, and the arrival of Mallam Nuhu Ribadu at the Pentagon was not open to the press.",
      "The Defense Department, which Hegseth now refers to as the Department of War, also did not answer questions about what the group planned to discuss and whether the military would change its posture in Africa, which military officials have long warned has become the world\u2019s hotbed for extremist terrorism.",
      "Earlier this month, Trump ordered the Defense Department to prepare for possible \"fast\" military action in Nigeria if the government there didn\u2019t do more to prevent the killing of Christians. The violence in Nigeria had been the focus of extensive coverage by Fox News and the Christian political right including Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Rep. Riley Moore, R-W. Va.",
      "Independent crisis-monitoring groups, including the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, say tens of thousands of civilians have been killed in Nigeria in recent years but say the tally represents both Muslims and Christians.",
      "In a post on his social media platform, Trump wrote on Nov. 1, \"if the Nigerian Government continues to allow the killing of Christians, the U.S.A. will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria, and may very well go into that now disgraced country, 'guns-a-blazing,' to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities. I am hereby instructing our Department of War to prepare for possible action. If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians! WARNING: THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT BETTER MOVE FAST!\"",
      "Hegseth quickly responded to Trump\u2019s post with a \"Yes sir,\" adding \u201cthe Department of War is preparing for action.\"",
      "Trump also put Nigeria back on a list of countries that the U.S. says have violated religious freedom.",

      "Sending U.S. ground troops into Nigeria would pose significant logistical and security challenges, due to Nigeria\u2019s remote terrain, porous borders and a population likely to bristle at a foreign presence. There are 6,500 military personnel deployed across Africa, primarily focused on counterterrorism missions. But the only personnel in Nigeria are embassy staff with no persistent presence of troops in West Africa or the Sahel region, which military warns is a hotbed for extremism.",

      "\u201cIf not for the misdeeds of Defendants, Mr. Boyd would not have been prosecuted, convicted, and imprisoned in violation of his constitutional rights, and would not have spent 45 years asserting his innocence and fighting for his liberty in connection with a crime that he did not commit,\u201d Boyd's attorneys wrote in the lawsuit.",
      "A spokesman for Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said the county extends its sympathy to Boyd's family, but he believes the $80 million award is egregious and the county plans to appeal.",

      "After Boyd was released from prison, he spent another two decades on parole before his conviction was vacated by a judge in 2021. The county opted not to retry Boyd or John Walker Jr., whose conviction in the case was also vacated.",
      "A third man convicted in the killing, Darren Gibson, was released from prison in 2008 and died a year later. One of the other teens was acquitted at trial, and the fifth teen testified against the others, which Boyd's attorneys said newly released case files show was coerced.",

      "The Trump administration is proposing new oil drilling off the California and Florida coasts for the first time in decades, as President Donald Trump seeks to expand U.S. oil production that is already leading the world",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration announced on Thursday new oil drilling off the California and Florida coasts for the first time in decades, advancing a project that critics say could harm coastal communities and ecosystems, as President Donald Trump seeks to expand U.S. oil production.",
      "The oil industry has been seeking access to new offshore areas, including Southern California and off the coast of Florida, as a way to boost U.S. energy security and jobs. The federal government has not allowed drilling in federal waters in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, which includes offshore Florida and part of offshore Alabama, since 1995, because of concerns about oil spills. California has some offshore oil rigs, but there has been no new leasing in federal waters since the mid-1980s.",
      "Since taking office for a second time in January, Trump has systematically reversed former President Joe Biden\u2019s focus on slowing climate change to pursue what the Republican calls U.S. \u201cenergy dominance\u201d in the global market. Trump, who recently called climate change \u201cthe greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world,\" created a National Energy Dominance Council and directed it to move quickly to drive up already record-high U.S. energy production, particularly fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s administration has blocked renewable energy sources such as offshore wind and canceled billions of dollars in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects across the country.",
      "Even before it was released, the offshore drilling plan has been met with strong opposition from California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who is eyeing a 2028 presidential run and has emerged as a leading Trump critic. Newsom pronounced the idea \u201cdead on arrival\u201d in a social media post. The proposal also is likely to draw bipartisan opposition in Florida. Tourism and access to clean beaches are key parts of the economy in both states.",
      "The administration\u2019s plan proposes six offshore lease sales off the coast of California.",
      "It also calls for new drilling off the coast of Florida in areas at least 100 miles from that state's shore. The area targeted for leasing is adjacent to an area in the Central Gulf of Mexico that already contains thousands of wells and hundreds of drilling platforms.",
      "The five-year plan also would compel more than 20 lease sales off the coast of Alaska, including a newly designated area known as the High Arctic, more than 200 miles offshore in the Arctic Ocean.",
      "All offshore areas \u201cwith the potential to generate jobs, new revenue and additional production to advance America\u2019s energy dominance should be considered for inclusion,\u201d the American Petroleum Institute and other groups said in a joint letter to the Trump administration in June.",
      "The groups cited California\u2019s history as an oil-producing state. \u201cUndiscovered resources could be readily produced given the array of existing infrastructure in the area, particularly in southern California,\u201d the letter said.",
      "Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican and Trump ally, helped persuade Trump officials to drop a similar offshore plan in 2018 when he was governor. Last week, Scott and fellow Florida Republican Sen. Ashley Moody\u2019 co-sponsored a bill to maintain a moratorium on offshore drilling in the state that Trump signed in his first term.",

      "A Newsom spokesman said Trump officials had not formally shared the plan, but said \u201cexpensive and riskier offshore drilling would put our communities at risk and undermine the economic stability of our coastal economies.\"",
      "California has been a leader in restricting offshore oil drilling since the infamous 1969 Santa Barbara spill that helped spark the modern environmental movement. While there have been no new federal leases offered since the mid-1980s, drilling from existing platforms continues.",
      "Newsom expressed support for greater offshore controls after a 2021 spill off Huntington Beach and has backed a congressional effort to ban new offshore drilling on the West Coast.",
      "A Texas-based company, with support from the Trump administration, is seeking to restart production in waters off Santa Barbara damaged by a 2015 oil spill. The administration has hailed the plan by Houston-based Sable Offshore Corp. as the kind of project Trump wants to increase U.S. energy production as the federal government removes regulatory barriers.",
      "Trump signed an executive order on the first day of his second term reversing former President Joe Biden\u2019s ban on future offshore oil drilling on the East and West coasts. A federal court later struck down Biden\u2019s order to withdraw 625 million acres of federal waters from oil development.",
      "Democratic lawmakers, including California Sens. Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff and Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, warned that opening vast coastlines to new offshore drilling \"would devastate coastal economies, jeopardize our national security, ravage coastal ecosystems, and put millions of Americans\u2019 health and safety at risk.''",
      "Oil spills \u201cnot only cause irreparable environmental damage, but also suppress the value of coastal homes, harm tourism economies and weaken coastal infrastructure,'' the lawmakers said in a letter signed by dozens of Democrats. One disastrous oil spill can cost taxpayers billions in lost revenue, cleanup costs and ecosystem restoration, they said.",
      "Joseph Gordon, campaign director for the environmental group Oceana, called the Trump administration's latest plan \u201can oil spill nightmare.\u201d",
      "Coastal communities \u201cdepend on healthy oceans for economic security and their cherished way of life,'' he said. \u201cWe need to protect our coasts from more offshore drilling, not put them up for sale to the oil and gas industry. There\u2019s too much at stake to risk more horrific oil spills that will haunt our coastlines for generations to come.\u201d",

      "New Hampshire Supreme Court justices are considering a disputed verdict in a landmark lawsuit over abuse at the state\u2019s youth detention center",
      "CONCORD, N.H. -- New Hampshire Supreme Court justices heard oral arguments Thursday about the disputed verdict in a landmark lawsuit over abuse at the state\u2019s youth detention center, questioning whether their decision could bankrupt the state or essentially let it off the hook.",
      "Jurors last year awarded $38 million to David Meehan, who alleged that the state\u2019s negligence allowed him to be repeatedly raped and beaten as a teenager at the Youth Development Center in Manchester. But the state is seeking to reduce the award under a sovereign immunity law that caps individual payouts at $475,000 per \u201cincident.\u201d",
      "Jurors were not aware of the cap, and some later said they wrote \u201cone\u201d on the verdict form to reflect a single case of post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from more than 100 episodes of physical, sexual and emotional abuse.",
      "Meehan\u2019s attorneys argue that because jurors found the state was wanton, malicious or oppressive, applying the cap would deprive Meehan of his constitutional right to equal protection. In order of preference, they asked the court to let the $38 million verdict stand, allow the trial judge to determine the number of incidents, order a new trial just on that question or order an entirely new trial.",
      "The state argues that the state\u2019s mismanagement of the facility constitutes a \u201csingle incident.\u201d Questioning that logic, Justice Patrick Donovan asked whether that would severely limit the total amount the state would pay to hundreds of others who claim they were similarly abused. The same law that limits individual payouts to $475,000 also caps the state\u2019s total per incident at $3.75 million.",
      "Meehan\u2019s attorney, Dan Deane, said the state\u2019s definition would pave the way for applying the larger cap to \u201cdecades of abuse.\u201d But Solicitor General Anthony Galdieri, representing the state, disagreed, saying each case involves different circumstances.",

It also calls to revive a court program that handled criminal cases originating on the Las Vegas Strip and coincided with orders banning people from the corridor for a year.",
      "But the Democratic-majority Senate made changes to his bill to include immigration-related provisions the governor might not be able to get behind. The amendment requires detention facilities to maintain a running list of people they hold. It also prohibits law enforcement officers \u2014 including immigration officers \u2014 from entering school grounds without a warrant or obtain information about a student. Lombardo vetoed a similar bill in June, calling it \u201cwell-intentioned but fundamentally overbroad.\u201d",
      "The special session was supposed to serve as an opportunity for Lombardo, a former Clark County sheriff, to pass his major policy priorities ahead of the 2026 election less than a year away. Lombardo is considered one of the most vulnerable Republican governors fighting for reelection.",

      "The legislation to offer $95 million in annual transferable tax credits to Sony Pictures Entertainment and Warner Bros. Discovery for a new film production facility in the Vegas suburbs previously failed the Legislature\u2019s regular session in June, but it was brought back after a campaign from trade unions.",

      "Construction workers flocked to the Legislature to urge lawmakers to support the bill, saying some people haven\u2019t worked a big job in Southern Nevada for two years since the completion of entertainment destinations like the Fontainebleau and the Sphere.

      "The family of enslaved potter David Drake \u2014 known as \u201cDave the Potter\u201d \u2014 has reclaimed two rare stoneware jars he created in South Carolina before the Civil War in what experts call the first major U.S. art restitution case involving works made by an e...",
      "BOSTON -- Inside the wide mouth of a stoneware jar, Daisy Whitner\u2019s fingertips found a slight rise in the clay \u2014 a mark she hoped was a trace left behind by her ancestor, an enslaved potter who shaped the vessel nearly 175 years ago in South Carolina.",
      "Standing in the gallery of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston last week, Whitner said she felt a quiet connection to her ancestor, David Drake, in that moment.",
      "\u201cI was telling the kids, \u2019Inside this jar, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m feeling his tears, sweat drops off his face, his arms,'\u201d said 86-year-old Whitner, a Washington, D.C., resident and a retired account manager for The Washington Post.",
      "The jar is one of two returned to Drake's family as part of a historic agreement this month between Drake's descendants and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, one of the institutions that holds pieces of his work.",
      "The vessels are among hundreds of surviving works by \u201cDave the Potter,\u201d an enslaved man who labored in the alkaline-glazed stoneware potteries of Edgefield, South Carolina, in the decades before and during the Civil War. Dave signed many of his jars \u2014 and inscribed some with rhyming couplets \u2014 an extraordinary and unparalleled assertion of identity and authorship during a time when literacy for enslaved people was criminalized.",
      "The agreement represents what experts say is the first major case of art restitution involving works created by an enslaved person in the U.S. \u2014 a process traditionally associated with families seeking the return of art looted by the Nazis in World War II.",
      "It\u2019s also rare: as enslaved people were denied legal personhood and documentation, tracing the ownership or lineage of their works is often impossible.",
      "Children\u2019s book author Yaba Baker, Dave's 54-year-old fourth-generation grandson, called the return \u201ca spiritual restoration.\u201d Baker, whose first two children\u2019s books explore Black history, said the family felt a dual sense of pride and grief. Many Black families, he noted, struggle to trace their ancestry past a few generations; recovering Dave\u2019s work gave them back a piece of themselves.",
      "After the museum returned the pots to the family, they sold one back so people can continue to learn from Dave's legacy. The other is on lease to the museum, at least temporarily. The MFA Boston said it wouldn't disclose how much it paid.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to hide them away in our house. We want other people to be inspired by it,\u201d Baker said. \u201cWe want people to know that this person, Dave the Potter, who was told he was nothing but a tool to be used, realized he had humanity. He deserved his own name on his pots. He deserved to write poetry. He deserved to know who he was.\u201d",
      "Laboring in the pottery yards in the South Carolina heat, Dave etched his name next to the date \u2014 July 12, 1834 \u2014 on a clay jar that would be sold by his owner and used to store pork and beef rations for enslaved people like him across the region.",
      "He also inscribed the jar, which would likely end up on a cotton plantation in South Carolina, with the couplet:",
      "\u201cPut every bit all between / Surely this jar will hold 14\u201d to mark the jar's 14-gallon capacity.",
      "The vessel was the first of hundreds, if not thousands, of stoneware jugs and jars made by Dave alongside other enslaved potters over 50 years before and during the Civil War.",
      "Much of Dave's poetry followed Christian themes. As he aged, he wrote more and explored themes related to his enslavement. One of his most resonant poems was etched into a jar he produced in 1857, around the time scholars believe Dave and his family were separated after being sold to different slave owners.",
      "\u201cI wonder where is all my relation / friendship to all \u2013 and every nation\"",
      "Multiple Drake descendants said they felt especially moved by Dave's question about his relations \u2014 and that their restitution felt like Dave's question was finally answered.",
      "It\u2019s unclear what became of the jars after Dave died. The MFA purchased them in 1997 from an art dealer. MFA Boston\u2019s Art of the Americas Chair Ethan Lasser said he thinks they survived mostly from pure \u201cbenign neglect\" in South Carolina because they were large and difficult to transport or break.",

      "The jar the Drake descendants sold back to the museum is similar to the 1857 pot on which Dave asks about his relations because he uses first-person language that suggests ownership \u2014 something that makes it especially powerful, Lasser said.",
      "\u201cThink of this as an enslaved person, speaking in the first person claiming authorship,\u201d Lasser said.",
      "In the poem, Dave writes:",
      "\u201cI made this Jar = cash \u2013 / though its called = lucre Trash\u201d.",

Oral histories indicate that Dave was disabled after losing a leg, although it's unclear how, and may have needed help with his ceramic work later in life.",
      "His last surviving jar, made as the Civil War raged on in 1862, reads: \u201cI made this Jar, all of cross / If you don\u2019t repent, you will be lost\u201d.",
      "Researchers believe Drake died sometime in the 1870s after gaining his freedom in the Civil War. He is accounted for in the 1870 census, but not in the 1880 census.",
      "For the Drake descendants, encountering Dave\u2019s work has been both moving and difficult \u2014 a collision of pride in his artistry and grief for the conditions in which he lived.",
      "Yaba Baker, who has a 17-year-old daughter and 13-year-old son, said the experience gave his family something they had never had before: a traceable link.",
      "\u201cI was able to turn to my son and say, \u2018This is your lineage.\u2019 Dave the Potter was not only a great artist \u2014 he resisted oppressive laws, even though he could have been killed for it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what you come from. Before, we didn\u2019t have that link.\u201d",

      "Since the MFA agreement was announced, the family has heard from museums and private collectors who hold Dave\u2019s work and want to discuss what ethical restitution might look like for them as well.",
      "Daisy Whitner said she felt her ancestor\u2019s presence each time she slid her hand inside the jar.",

      "A new Texas law says every public school classroom must display a poster listing the Ten Commandments",
      "DALLAS -- When it became clear to Texas high school theater teacher Gigi Cervantes that she couldn't ignore a new state law requiring the Ten Commandments to be posted in her Fort Worth classroom, she felt she had no choice. She resigned from the job she loved.",
      "In the small city of Whitesboro, eighth grade U.S. history teacher Dustin Parsons welcomed the new poster on his classroom wall, saying the display helps him demonstrate the influence of Christianity on the country\u2019s founding principles.",
      "Across Texas, there are no shortage of strong opinions among teachers, parents and students as the state undertakes the nation\u2019s largest attempt to hang the Ten Commandments in public schools. In the rush to navigate the Republican-led mandate that took effect in September, the rollout has forced some administrators, teachers and school boards to confront hard choices.",
      "\u201cI just was not going to be a part of forcing or imposing religious doctrine onto my students,\u201d Cervantes said.",
      "Federal courts have ordered more than two dozen of the state\u2019s roughly 1,200 school districts to not hang the posters, including on Tuesday when a judge said the mandate violates First Amendment language guaranteeing religious liberty and forbidding government establishment of religion. Courts have also ruled against similar laws in Arkansas and Louisiana, and the issue is expected to reach the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "But many Texas classrooms are far along in implementing a law that has animated school board meetings, spun up guidance about what to say when students ask questions, and led to boxes of donated posters being dropped on the doorsteps of campuses statewide. Some districts didn\u2019t wait: In suburban Dallas, school officials in Frisco spent about $1,800 to print nearly 5,000 posters, even though the law only requires schools to hang the Ten Commandments if the displays are donated. Some schools have no posters to hang.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not evangelizing,\u201d Parsons said. \u201cI\u2019m doing it more from a history source perspective in how they were building the Constitution.\u201d",
      "The law says schools must put donated posters \u201cin a conspicuous place\u201d and requires the writing to be a size and typeface that is visible from anywhere in a classroom to a person with \u201caverage vision.\u201d The displays must also be 16 inches wide and 20 inches tall (40 centimeters wide and 50 centimeters tall).",
      "South of Austin, the Hays Consolidated Independent School District posted copies of the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Bill of Rights \u2014 which includes the First Amendment \u2014 alongside the state-required Ten Commandments.",
      "\u201cDistricts are in between a rock and a hard place,\u201d said Elizabeth Beeton, a member of the Galveston Independent School District\u2019s school board.",
      "Judges blocked the posters in some schools, including some of Texas\u2019 largest, after parents brought lawsuits. In Galveston, the school board voted not to post the commandments until the law\u2019s constitutionality is decided in the courts, but then found themselves the target of a state lawsuit. This week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced lawsuits against two more districts he said were violating the law, though one, the Leander Independent School District said they are displaying donated posters.",
      "Texas' law easily passed the GOP-controlled Legislature and Republicans, including President Donald Trump, have backed posting the Ten Commandments in classrooms.",

      "When the Ten Commandments were posted last month throughout 16-year-old Madison Creed\u2019s high school in the small East Texas city of Carthage, she said it briefly became the \u201cbuzz of the school\u201d as students debated whether the religious doctrine belonged there.",
      "\u201cEverybody had their opinion about it,\u201d Creed said. \u201cI know talking to a lot of my peers and my classmates that a lot of us don\u2019t agree with it but there is the other portion of the school that does.\u201d",
      "Word also came that the high school band director had resigned over the law. Johnnie Cotton wrote on Facebook that he believed \u201cvery strongly that politics and religion have no place in the public schools.\u201d",
      "Creed, who plays in the band, said she understood and agreed with Cotton's stance, and admired that he stood up for his beliefs, even though his resignation two weeks before a big competition was badly timed.",
      "Creed\u2019s mother, Tiffany Meadows, said the posting of the commandments didn\u2019t bother her because she and her children are Christians, but that she was worried about students of other religions.",
      "\u201cThese are public schools, these aren\u2019t Christian schools,\u201d Meadows said.",

      "\u201cI kind of feel like we are living through a time where people who are in positions to be standing up for things are not standing up, not speaking out and there\u2019s a climate of fear,\" Cervantes said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to be any part of that.\u201d",

And why Pope Leo XIV is traveling on Nov. 28 to the site of this foundational moment in Christian unity as part of his first major foreign trip as pope.",
      "In 325, the council hashed out the first version of the Nicene Creed, a statement of faith that millions of Christians still recite each Sunday.",
      "\u201cThe occasion is very, very important \u2014 the first global, ecumenical council in history and the first form of creed acknowledged by all the Christians,\u201d said church historian Giovanni Maria Vian, coauthor of \u201cLa Scomessa di Costantino,\" or \"Constantine\u2019s Gamble,\u201d published in Italy in tandem with the anniversary.",

The World Council of Churches, which includes Orthodox and Protestant groups, marked the anniversary in Egypt in October. At a Pittsburgh-area ecumenical celebration in November, the tongue-in-cheek catchphrase was, \u201cParty like it\u2019s 325.\u201d",
      "The Council of Nicaea is important both for what was done and how it was done.",
      "It involved an unprecedented gathering of at least 250 bishops from around the Roman Empire. Emperor Constantine had consolidated control over the empire after years of civil war and political intrigues.",
      "Constantine wouldn\u2019t formally convert to Christianity until the end of his life. But by 325, he had already been showing tolerance and favor toward a Christian sect that had emerged from the last great spasm of Roman persecution.",
      "Constantine wanted a unified church to support his unified empire. But the church was tearing itself apart.",
      "It\u2019s sometimes called the \u201cTrinitarian Controversy,\u201d though the debate wasn\u2019t so much about whether there was a Trinity \u2014 God as Father, Son (Jesus) and Holy Spirit \u2014 but about how the Son was related to the Father.",

      "The bishops nearly unanimously supported a creed endorsed by the emperor. It\u2019s a shorter version of the Nicene Creed recited in church today. It declared Jesus to be \u201ctrue God\u201d and condemned those who proclaimed Arian ideas.",

      "The council also adopted a formula for determining the date of Easter, which had been controversial. The council approved the calendar favored by Arian sympathizers, setting Easter for the Sunday after the first full moon of spring. That gave each side a win, said David Potter, author of \u201cConstantine the Emperor\u201d and a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Michigan.",

      "The Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches had their own schism in the 11th century. They\u2019d already been growing apart over such things as papal authority, but a big controversy was that the Western churches had added a clause in the Nicene Creed that the Eastern ones hadn\u2019t agreed to. Specifically, the original creed said the Holy Spirit \u201cproceeds from the Father,\u201d but Catholics added, \u201cand the Son.\u201d",

      "What\u2019s called autoimmune encephalitis attacks the organ that makes us \u201cus,\u201d and it can appear out of the blue.",
      "Morrill went for a bike ride with friends along the California coast, stopping for lunch, and they noticed nothing wrong. Neither did Morrill until his wife asked how it went \u2014 and he'd forgotten. Morrill would get worse before he got better. \u201cUnhinged\u201d and \u201cfighting to see light,\u201d he wrote as delusions set in and holes in his memory grew.",
      "Of all the ways our immune system can run amok and damage the body instead of protecting it, autoimmune encephalitis is one of the most unfathomable. Seemingly healthy people abruptly spiral with confusion, memory loss, seizures, even psychosis.",
      "But doctors are getting better at identifying it, thanks to discoveries of a growing list of the rogue antibodies responsible that, if found in blood and spinal fluid, aid diagnosis. Every year new culprit antibodies are being uncovered, said Dr. Sam Horng, a neurologist at Mount Sinai Health System in New York who has cared for patients with multiple forms of this mysterious disease.",
      "And while treatment today involves general ways to fight the inflammation, two major clinical trials are underway aiming for more targeted therapy.",
      "Still, it's tricky. Symptoms can be mistaken for psychiatric or other neurologic disorders, delaying proper treatment.",
      "\u201cWhen someone\u2019s having new changes in their mental status, they\u2019re worsening and if there\u2019s sort of like a bizarre quality to it, that\u2019s something that kind of tips our suspicion,\u201d Horng said. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to miss a treatable condition.\u201d",
      "With early diagnosis and care, some patients fully recover. Others like Morrill recover normal daily functioning but grapple with some lasting damage \u2014 in his case, lost decades of \u201cautobiographical\u201d memories. This 72-year-old literature major can still spout facts and figures learned long ago, and he makes new memories every day. But even family photos can\u2019t help him recall pivotal moments in his own life.",
      "\u201cI remember \u2018Ulysses\u2019 is published in Paris in 1922 at Sylvia Beach\u2019s bookstore. Why do I remember that, which is of no use to me anymore, and yet I can\u2019t remember my son\u2019s wedding?\u201d Morrill wonders.",
      "Encephalitis means the brain is inflamed and symptoms can vary from mild to life-threatening. Infections are a common cause, typically requiring treatment of the underlying virus or bacteria. But when that's ruled out, an autoimmune cause has to be considered, Horng said, especially when symptoms arise suddenly.",
      "The umbrella term autoimmune encephalitis covers a group of diseases with weird-sounding names based on the antibody fueling it, such as anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.",
      "While they're not new diseases, that one got a name in 2007 when Dr. Josep Dalmau, then at the University of Pennsylvania, discovered the first culprit antibody, sparking a hunt for more.",
      "That anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis tends to strike younger women and, one of the bizarre factors, it\u2019s sometimes triggered by an ovarian \u201cdermoid\u201d cyst.",
      "How? That type of cyst has similarities to some brain tissue, Horng explained. The immune system can develop antibodies recognizing certain proteins from the growth. If those antibodies get into the brain, they can mistakenly target NMDA receptors on healthy brain cells, sparking personality and behavior changes that can include hallucinations.",
      "Different antibodies create different problems depending if they mostly hit memory and mood areas in the brain, or sensory and movement regions.",
      "Altogether, \u201cfacets of personhood seem to be impaired,\" Horng said.",

      "Those cyst-related antibodies stealthily attacked Kiara Alexander in Charlotte, North Carolina, who\u2019d never heard of the brain illness.

      "Operation \u201cSwamp Sweep,\u201d an expansive, monthslong immigration crackdown, is expected to launch in southeast Louisiana Dec. 1, but Democrat-run New Orleans is anticipating the arrival of as many as 250 federal troops as soon as Friday, all with the backing of the state\u2019s Republican governor.",
      "Governor Jeff Landry has sought to align New Orleans with federal immigration enforcement efforts through legislation and legal challenges, and the Border Patrol deployment is just the latest drive to ramp up that pressure. And with the New Orleans Police Department being released from a federal reform pact Wednesday, its officers have lost a legal mechanism that has long-shielded them from having to participate in immigration enforcement.",

      "Landry, who has close ties to the nation\u2019s top immigration officials, has made immigration enforcement a priority.",
      "Louisiana does not share a border with another country, yet it has become one of the nation\u2019s largest detention hubs for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, with a capacity upward of 6,000 detainees. In September, the Bayou State opened the \u201cLouisiana Lockup\" inside a notorious state prison to hold immigrants whom federal officials consider dangerous.",
      "The governor has also highlighted crimes in which the suspect\u2019s immigration status is in question, such as the killing of a French Quarter tour guide by a group that included a Honduran man who entered the country illegally.",
      "New Orleans\u2019 Democratic leaders frequently butt heads with Landry and other state officials who accuse the city of lax law enforcement and have pushed for collaboration with the Trump administration\u2019s sweeping immigration crackdown.",

South Louisiana\u2019s distinctive Cajun heritage emerged from French-speaking colonists exiled there in the 18th century.",
      "In September, Landry requested a National Guard deployment to New Orleans, citing rising violent crime, even though city police say crime is down and its elected leaders say federal troops are unnecessary. Landry told Newsmax on Wednesday that the \u201cSwamp Sweep\u201d operation is focused on \u201ctaking dangerous criminals off the street.\u201d",

Another measure directs state agencies to verify, track and report anyone illegally in the U.S. who is receiving state services, and one more bans city policies that prohibit cooperation with federal immigration agencies.",
      "\u201cTheir enforcement of laws is indiscriminate at best, corrupt at worst,\u201d said Republican state Sen. Jay Morris, who was behind the law punishing obstruction of immigration enforcement. \u201cApparently we have to have a law to tell people not to break the law.\u201d",

      "Children\u2019s and consumer advocacy groups are urging parents not to buy AI-powered toys during the holiday season",
      "They\u2019re cute, even cuddly, and promise learning and companionship \u2014 but artificial intelligence toys are not safe for kids, according to children\u2019s and consumer advocacy groups urging parents not to buy them during the holiday season.",
      "These toys, marketed to kids as young as 2 years old, are generally powered by AI models that have already been shown to harm children and teenagers, such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, according to an advisory published Thursday by the children\u2019s advocacy group Fairplay and signed by more than 150 organizations and individual experts such as child psychiatrists and educators.",
      "\u201cThe serious harms that AI chatbots have inflicted on children are well-documented, including fostering obsessive use, having explicit sexual conversations, and encouraging unsafe behaviors, violence against others, and self-harm,\u201d Fairplay said.",
      "AI toys, made by companies such as Curio Interactive and Keyi Technologies, are often marketed as educational, but Fairplay says they can displace important creative and learning activities. They promise friendship but also disrupt children\u2019s relationships and resilience, the group said.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s different about young children is that their brains are being wired for the first time and developmentally it is natural for them to be trustful, for them to seek relationships with kind and friendly characters,\u201d said Rachel Franz, director of Fairplay\u2019s Young Children Thrive Offline Program. Because of this, she added, the amount of trust young children are putting in these toys can exacerbate the harms seen with older children.",
      "Fairplay, a 25-year-old organization formerly known as the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, has been warning about AI toys for years. They just weren\u2019t as advanced as they are today. A decade ago, during an emerging fad of internet-connected toys and AI speech recognition, the group helped lead a backlash against Mattel\u2019s talking Hello Barbie doll that it said was recording and analyzing children\u2019s conversations.",
      "This time, though AI toys are mostly sold online and more popular in Asia than elsewhere, Franz said some have started to appear on store shelves in the U.S. and more could be on the way.",
      "\u201cEverything has been released with no regulation and no research, so it gives us extra pause when all of a sudden we see more and more manufacturers, including Mattel, who recently partnered with OpenAI, potentially putting out these products,\u201d Franz said.",
      "It\u2019s the second big seasonal warning against AI toys since consumer advocates at U.S. PIRG last week called out the trend in its annual \u201c Trouble in Toyland \u201d report that typically looks at a range of product hazards, such as high-powered magnets and button-sized batteries that young children can swallow. This year, the organization tested four toys that use AI chatbots.",
      "\u201cWe found some of these toys will talk in-depth about sexually explicit topics, will offer advice on where a child can find matches or knives, act dismayed when you say you have to leave, and have limited or no parental controls,\u201d the report said. One of the toys, a teddy bear made by Singapore-based FoloToy, was later withdrawn, its CEO told CNN this week.",
      "Dr. Dana Suskind, a pediatric surgeon and social scientist who studies early brain development, said young children don't have the conceptual tools to understand what an AI companion is. While kids have always bonded with toys through imaginative play, when they do this they use their imagination to create both sides of a pretend conversation, \u201cpracticing creativity, language, and problem-solving,\u201d she said.",

We don\u2019t yet know the developmental consequences of outsourcing that imaginative labor to an artificial agen \u2014 but it\u2019s very plausible that it undercuts the kind of creativity and executive function that traditional pretend play builds,\u201d Suskind said.",
      "Beijing-based Keyi, maker of an AI \u201cpetbot\u201d called Loona, didn\u2019t return requests for comment this week, but other AI toymakers sought to highlight their child safety protections.",
      "California-based Curio Interactive makes stuffed toys, like Gabbo and rocket-shaped Grok, that have been promoted by the pop singer Grimes. The company said it has \u201cmeticulously designed\u201d guardrails to protect children and the company encourages parents to \u201cmonitor conversations, track insights, and choose the controls that work best for their family.\u201d",
      "In response to the earlier PIRG findings, Curio said it is \"actively working with our team to address any concerns, while continuously overseeing content and interactions to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for children.\u201d",
      "Another company, Miko, based in Mumbai, India, said it uses its own conversational AI model rather than relying on general large language model systems such as ChatGPT in order to make its product \u2014 an interactive AI robot \u2014 safe for children.",
      "\u201cWe are always expanding our internal testing, strengthening our filters, and introducing new capabilities that detect and block sensitive or unexpected topics,\" said CEO Sneh Vaswani. \u201cThese new features complement our existing controls that allow parents and caregivers to identify specific topics they\u2019d like to restrict from conversation. We will continue to invest in setting the highest standards for safe, secure and responsible AI integration for Miko products.\u201d",
      "Miko\u2019s products are sold by major retailers such as Walmart and Costco and have been promoted by the families of social media \u201ckidfluencers\u201d whose YouTube videos have millions of views. On its website, it markets its robots as \u201cArtificial Intelligence. Genuine friendship.\u201d",
      "Ritvik Sharma, the company's senior vice president of growth, said Miko actually \u201cencourages kids to interact more with their friends, to interact more with the peers, with the family members etc. It\u2019s not made for them to feel attached to the device only.\u201d",
      "Still, Suskind and children's advocates say analog toys are a better bet for the holidays.",
      "\"Kids need lots of real human interaction. Play should support that, not take its place. The biggest thing to consider isn\u2019t only what the toy does; it\u2019s what it replaces. A simple block set or a teddy bear that doesn\u2019t talk back forces a child to invent stories, experiment, and work through problems. AI toys often do that thinking for them,\" she said. \u201cHere\u2019s the brutal irony: when parents ask me how to prepare their child for an AI world, unlimited AI access is actually the worst preparation possible.\u201d",

Critics see the vote as political meddling that creates confusion over the future management of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.",
      "Tuesday's House vote followed passage by the Senate during the government shutdown of the resolution disapproving a management plan for the reserve that was finalized in 2022 under then-President Joe Biden. The offices of Alaska's Republican congressional delegation members have said the resolution \u201cfulfills the objectives\u201d of an Alaska-specific executive order signed by President Donald Trump earlier this year. The executive order called for reinstating a plan dating to the first Trump administration that sought to make available for leasing about 80% of the reserve.",
      "The measure next goes to Trump for consideration.",
      "There has been outsized attention on Alaska since Trump\u2019s return to office, with moves to expand development of oil and gas and other resources cheered by state political leaders who had considered the Biden administration overly restrictive in its approach.",
      "The votes are among the latest taken under the Congressional Review Act that are aimed at nullifying land management plans adopted under Biden. A statement from the congressional delegation last month said the review act provides an expedited way to overturn certain federal rules and forbids an agency from issuing another substantially similar rule unless it's authorized by law.",

      "Michel, 52, declined to address the court before U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly sentenced him.",
      "In April 2023, a federal jury convicted Michel of 10 counts, including conspiracy and acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government. The trial in Washington, D.C., included testimony from actor Leonardo DiCaprio and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.",
      "Justice Department prosecutors said federal sentencing guidelines recommended a life sentence for Michel, whom they said \"betrayed his country for money\" and \"lied unapologetically and unrelentingly to carry out his schemes.\"",
      "\"His sentence should reflect the breadth and depth of his crimes, his indifference to the risks to his country, and the magnitude of his greed,\" they wrote.",
      "Defense attorney Peter Zeidenberg said his client's 14-year sentence is \"completely disproportionate to the offense.\" Michel will appeal his conviction and sentence, according to his lawyer.",
      "Zeidenberg had recommended a three-year prison sentence. A life sentence would be an \"absurdly high\" punishment for Michel, given that it is typically reserved for deadly terrorists and drug cartel leaders, Michel's attorneys said in a court filing.",
      "\"The Government's position is one that would cause Inspector Javert to recoil and, if anything, simply illustrates just how easily the Guidelines can be manipulated to produce absurd results, and how poorly equipped they are, at least on this occasion, to determine a fair and just sentence,\" they wrote.",
      "Michel, a Brooklyn native whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from Haiti, was a founding member of the Fugees along with childhood friends Lauryn Hill and Wyclef Jean. Their hip-hop band won two Grammy Awards and sold tens of millions of albums.",
      "Michel obtained more than $120 million from Malaysian billionaire Low Taek Jho \u2014 also known as Jho Low \u2014 and steered some of that money through straw donors to Obama's campaign.",
      "Michel said during trial that he viewed Low's payments as \"free money,\" and accepted the millions over the course of nine months to help Low secure a photo op with Obama. He said under oath at the time that no one told him such payments toward political donations could have been unlawful or violations of campaign finance laws.",
      "The Justice Department also charged Michel with serving as an unregistered foreign agent for China, alleging that in 2017 he sought to sway the Trump administration to halt its probe into Low and to extradite a Chinese government target living in the U.S. That individual, dissident Miles Guo, was charged in New York in a billion-dollar fraud case and is still in custody.",
      "Low, who has lived in China, was one of the primary financiers of \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" a movie starring DiCaprio. Low is a fugitive but has maintained his innocence.",
      "\"Low's motivation for giving Mr. Michel money to donate was not so that he could achieve some policy objective. Instead, Low simply wanted to obtain a photograph with himself and then-President Obama,\" Michel's attorneys wrote.",
      "In August 2024, the judge rejected Michel's request for a new trial based in part on his defense attorney's use of a generative artificial intelligence program during his closing of the trial's arguments.

    "summary": "British singer Lily Allen tells Anthony Mason about heartbreak and healing in her only TV interview about her new album, \"West End Girl.\"",
    "story": [
      "As an artist, Lily Allen stands firm by her belief that heartbreak can be a gift. After all, it helped lead to her latest album, \"West End Girl.\"",
      "\"You know, while I was writing it, I wasn't really sure that it was going to see the light of day,\" Allen told CBS News special correspondent Anthony Mason in an interview for \"CBS Mornings\" that aired Thursday, describing the music as \"an act of desperation.\" The studio album, released in late October, was written during the breakup of her nearly 4-year marriage to \"Stranger Things\" actor David Harbour.",
      "The theme of what's been described as Allen's epic \"breakup album\" centers around tales of a deceptive partner, which the singer says is based partly on truth and partly on fantasy.",
      "Harbour has not directly addressed his breakup with Allen or commented on her \"West End Girl\" album. But in an interview with Esquire UK, published around the album's release, Harbour discussed the importance of accepting your mistakes. \"I'd change everything or nothing. If you accept your past, you accept it completely, even the pain, the mistakes... It's all part of the journey, the growth, the wisdom, the empathy, and the connection, and if you change one thing, you change everything,\" he told the magazine at the time, adding that his work is about being honest.",
      "New album says \"everything that I needed to say\"",
      "But Allen said it was a \"nightmare\" holding onto the album and stunted her healing process. She felt a sense of relief and peace when she finally was able to share her words with the world.",
      "\"Since I've put it out, it's felt completely and utterly liberating. It was kind of hellish having it in the background,\" Allen said. \"I don't know. I just feel like I couldn't \u2013 it said everything that I needed to say. And I felt like I couldn't really like get on with my life until I'd said it.\"",
      "Her newly released music quickly lit up social media, with fans reacting to it on TikTok.",
      "Allen wrote most of the record within the span of 10 days at the end of last year. She was excited to complete the album, but at the same time her personal life was falling into pieces.",
      "After spending Christmas with her two daughters whom she shares with ex-husband Sam Cooper, Allen decided to check herself into a treatment facility.",
      "\"I knew the things I was feeling were too intense,\" Allen explained her decision to seek professional help at the time following her separation. As a recovering alcoholic, Allen said she's not afraid of working on herself and knew she needed some quiet time.",
      "A cathartic release",
      "The Brooklyn townhouse that Allen and Harbour gave Architectural Digest a tour of in 2023 is now listed for around $8 million. The pair bought the home in early 2021 shortly after they got married.",
      "Allen said her music was cathartic \u2013 for herself and her children.",
      "\"All of the pain that, you know, that I've been through in the past year, they've been through too,\" Allen said. \" But you know, one thing that I wanted to do was to show my kids that, you know, you can use that pain and harness it and turn it into something else. And I think I've done that.\"",
      "Now, Allen is preparing for her 2026 tour \u2013 her first since she got sober in 2019.",
      "The singer said she's planning her touring schedule around her girls' holidays so they'll be able to come and bring their friends.",
      "\"I can't wait to have them there. It's like, it's gonna be... It's as much for them as it is for me,\" Allen said, adding that she feels like she's living her best life after a year of healing.",

    "summary": "Many fans of Taylor Swift showed parasocial relationships with the pop star after her engagement to Travis Kelce.",
    "story": [
      "If you felt a personal connection with a celebrity this year, you likely weren't alone.",
      "That feeling led Cambridge Dictionary to select \"parasocial\" as its 2025 word of the year. Parasocial is defined as \"involving or relating to a connection that someone feels between themselves and a famous person they do not know, a character in a book, film, TV series, etc., or an artificial intelligence.\"",
      "It's an academic term that has only been around for about 70 years, but it has now become mainstream, said Colin McIntosh, the lexical program manager for Cambridge Dictionary.",
      "\"Millions of people are engaged in parasocial relationships; many more are simply intrigued by their rise,\" McIntosh said in a statement. \"The data reflects that, with the Cambridge Dictionary website seeing spikes in lookups for 'parasocial.'\"",
      "A recent example of this happened when pop star Taylor Swift and NFL star Travis Kelce announced their engagement. Many fans who have been captivated by Swift's lyrics for years celebrated the moment despite not actually knowing her or Kelce.",
      "But parasocial relationships can become problematic, Simone Schnall, a professor of experimental social psychology at the University of Cambridge, said.",
      "\"We've entered an age where many people form unhealthy and intense parasocial relationships with influencers,\" Schnall said. \"This leads to a sense that people 'know' those they form parasocial bonds with, can trust them and even to extreme forms of loyalty. Yet it's completely one sided.\"",
      "The trend is also evolving to include artificial intelligence.",
      "\"Parasocial trends take on a new dimension as many people treat AI tools like ChatGPT as 'friends,' offering positive affirmations, or as a proxy for therapy. This is an illusion of a relationship and group think, and we know young people can be susceptible for this,\" Schnall said.",
      "Cambridge Dictionary's announcement follows Dictionary.com naming \"67\"\u00a0as its 2025 word of the year.",

      "YouTuber and social media influencer Jack Doherty was arrested for drug possession and other charges in Miami Beach after he was found disrupting traffic to allegedly film social media content, police said.",
      "Miami Beach Police announced that the 22-year-old was taken into custody early Saturday on multiple charges, including possessing amphetamine and marijuana, along with resisting an officer without violence.",
      "\"The Miami Beach Police Department remains steadfast in its commitment to maintain public safety and order throughout the city\u2014regardless of celebrity status,\" the agency said. \"The Department will continue to take proactive enforcement action against behavior that endangers residents, visitors, or officers and will hold all individuals accountable under the law.\"",
      "Later Saturday night, Doherty posted a TikTok video showing him bonding out of jail with the caption \"I got arrested last night and now I'm free.\"",
      "\"I'm a free man, baby,\" he said in the video, while holding the property bag that held his personal items at the time of his arrest. \"Let's go.\"",
      "According to his bio on Delka Talents, his talent agency, Doherty has over 3.2 million YouTube subscribers and over 500 million YouTube views. Doherty is best known for filming \"daredevil\" stunts and pranks, and his most-watched video has over 18 million views as of March 2018, his bio said.",

      "An influencer blocks traffic for the sake of \"content\"",
      "Around 3:12 a.m. Saturday, Miami Beach Police officers were conducting a high-visibility detail along the 700 block of Washington Avenue within the city's Entertainment District, when a group of individuals entered the roadway from the east sidewalk into the northbound lanes. A man from the group -- later identified as Doherty -- separated from them and attempted to engage officers to \"create video content, positioning himself in the middle of the roadway with passing vehicular traffic and creating a significant safety hazard,\" according to arrest documents obtained by CBS News Miami.",
      "Miami Beach Police officers began issuing multiple commands to direct Doherty to exit the roadway, but he refused. Even after his group urged him to comply, he continued refusing officers' commands.",
      "Officers continued, warning Doherty that failure to comply would result in his arrest. Still, the influencer continued to refuse commands and told them, \"Once I'm done with this bet,\" the arrest documents said. At this moment, Miami Beach Police safely apprehended Doherty in the middle of the road due to his \"deliberate refusal to follow lawful orders and continued to obstruct traffic.\"",
      "According to arrest documents, while officers searched Doherty's person, they found \"half of an orange oval-shaped pill with 3 imprinted on it, consistent with a Schedule II amphetamine, as well as a black plastic container holding three hand-rolled suspected cannabis cigarettes weighing approximately 4.0 grams combined.\"",
      "After a records check that showed no active warrants, officers took Doherty to Miami Beach Police's holding facility for booking and contacted an after-hours attorney for charging guidance.",

      "In \"Defying Gravity: The Creative Career of Stephen Schwartz, from Godspell to Wicked\" (published by Applause Books), biographer Carol de Giere explores the life and work of the Grammy- and Oscar-winning composer of treasured Broadway and movie hits.",
      "Read an excerpt below, in which Schwartz finds the inspiration of what will become his most successful musical production to date, when he discovers Gregory Maguire's prequel to L. Frank Baum's \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" \u2013 the genesis of the long-running Broadway musical \"Wicked.\"",

      "Landing in Oz",
      "\"It's time to trust my instincts, close my eyes and leap!\" \u2014Wicked",
      "At the start of 1996, Stephen Schwartz never imagined he would end the year envisioning his next Broadway musical, Wicked. Movie songwriting seemed to be his future, especially after one eventful evening in March. He donned his newly-purchased black tuxedo and white silk dress shirt, strode across the red carpet, and met up with his Pocahontas writing partner Alan Menken at Los Angeles' Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. For forty-eight-year-old Schwartz, being nominated for an Academy Award was a welcome twist on his childhood dream of writing musicals for the stage. With his parents and wife in the audience, he waited for the announcement.",
      "\"And the Oscar for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score goes to\u2026\" An expectant silence settled in the hall while presenter Quincy Jones opened the envelope.",
      "\"Alan Menken, musical and orchestral score, and Stephen Schwartz, lyrics, for Pocahontas.\" Applause burst out while the pair made their way to the stage. As Menken thanked their Pocahontas music team, Schwartz clutched his golden statuette and smiled, looking down at Mel Gibson in the front row making funny faces at him and soaking in the acknowledgment from Hollywood. That evening he and Menken also stepped up to accept the award for Best Original Song, \"Colors of the Wind.\"",
      "Back home in Connecticut, he placed his gold-plated statuettes beside his Grammy gramophones in a trophy case converted from an aquarium that his kids no longer used.",
      "The rest of the year was a busy one, with the premiere of The Hunchback of Notre Dame and early work on The Prince of Egypt involving meetings with the DreamWorks team and the writing and demo-ing of songs. He was also working on an early production of a revue musical Snapshots in Seattle, confident that when finally finished, the show would go direct to stock and amateur licensing rather than to a commercial production. The one thing he was emphatically not doing was planning anything new for Broadway.",
      "Then towards the end of the year, a phone call came that would change everything. He was in Los Angeles finishing some work on The Prince of Egypt when his long-time buddy, songwriter John Bucchino, called him from the island of Maui in Hawaii. Singer-songwriter Holly Near had hired Bucchino as a piano accompanist for her performances at a conference at the tropical getaway. Once on Maui, Bucchino decided it was too good not to share. His room included an extra bed, and he had a car and free food. \"If you can cash in some frequent flyer miles and come for the weekend, you'll have a free vacation in Hawaii,\" Bucchino offered.",
      "\"Why not?\" thought Schwartz. He had the weekend free, and after all, it was Hawaii. \"I am so there,\" came Schwartz's answer from LA, and by December 16th, he was.",
      "When Bucchino and Near had a block of time away from the stage, they organized a snorkeling adventure with Schwartz and Near's friend, Pat Hunt. A small boat sped them over to Molikini, a mostly submerged volcanic crater popular for its rainbow spread of sea creatures that delight snorkelers.",
      "On the trip back, Holly casually mentioned to Stephen, \"I'm reading this really interesting book called Wicked, by Gregory Maguire.\"",
      "The novel's title sounded intriguing. \"I think I've heard of it. What's it about?\" he inquired.",
      "\"It's the Oz story from the Wicked Witch of the West's point of view.\"",
      "In an instant, Schwartz's imagination flashed through the implications of a backstory for The Wizard of Oz told from the perspective of the unpopular witch. His reaction was visceral: \"All the hairs on my arms stood on end,\" he recalls. \"I thought it was the best idea for a musical I had ever heard.\"",
      "As soon as he returned to his LA apartment, he called his attorney in New York, inquiring about Maguire's 1995 novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West. \"Okay, this book has been out for a while, so somebody has the rights. I need you to find out who has them. Meanwhile, I'm going to get the book and read it, because I think I have to do this.\"",
      "There was no way around it. This was a Broadway concept not suited to a small-budget theater company. And he knew it was a highly theatrical idea, not one meant for film or television. Although he had firmly decided, indeed pledged, never to work on Broadway again, his instincts didn't leave him a choice.",
      "But with such a popular novel, surely someone in Hollywood was converting it to the silver screen. Schwartz would have to stop them, and somehow inspire the rights holders to consider instead the risky, expensive, and time-consuming venture of producing a musical in New York City.",
      "While his attorney, Nancy Rose, followed clues on the rights trail, Wicked's prospective composer-lyricist read the novel and confirmed that his hunch had been right: musicalizing the Wicked Witch's story seemed \"quintessentially an idea for me,\" meaningful enough to be worth the potential struggle.",
      "For one thing, he loved looking at traditional stories from a new angle. When he was in college he saw Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, Tom Stoppard's play in which two minor characters in Shakespeare's Hamlet are made the central characters. \"It was a revelation to me,\" he recalls. \"From that point on, the idea of looking at familiar material from an unfamiliar point of view became a goal for my own work.\" Godspell had approached the New Testament in a fresh way, Children of Eden reworked Genesis for a new take on family life, and The Prince of Egypt explored the Exodus story from the standpoint of the brother relationship between Moses and Ramses. But Gregory Maguire's twist on The Wizard of Oz was a chance to do something more directly like the Rosencrantz and Guildenstern concept. \"I recognized immediately that this was a genius idea and that it was an idea for me: the way it took a familiar subject and spun it,\" Schwartz recalls.",
      "Wicked also felt inherently musical to him. \"Elphaba is a very musical character with big emotions. She is fantastical. The world is fantastical. Glinda is very musical.\" To him it was clear that the world of musical theater was where the story belonged.",
      "And then there was the character Maguire's vision had moved to the center of the story: Elphaba, the quirky and misunderstood green girl who becomes the Wicked Witch of the West. Maguire named her after L. Frank Baum, who penned The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, when he pondered the sound of the author's initials \"eL\" \"Fa\" \"Ba.\" Elphaba's story seemed close to Schwartz's own emotional experience. He knew what it felt like to be \"green\" and what inner resources are needed to carry on with life. \"The idea of the story created a sympathetic resonance in me,\" Schwartz affirms, \"and I know that I'm not alone. Anyone who is an artist in our society is going to identify with Elphaba. Anyone who is of an ethnic minority, who is black or Jewish or gay, or a woman feeling she grew up in a man's world, or anyone who grew up feeling a dissonance between who they are inside and the world around them, will identify with Elphaba. Since that's so many of us, I think there will be a lot of people who will.\"",
      "\"There were things that I knew right away. I knew how it was going to begin, I knew how it was going to end, I knew who Elphaba was, and I knew why\u2014 on some strange level\u2014this was autobiographical even though it was about a green girl in Oz.\" \u2014Stephen Schwartz",
      "Schwartz bought a spiral notebook in which he would capture all his story and lyric ideas\u2014snatches of inspiration, research notes, lists of rhyming words, first drafts of lyric lines, and later drafts. On the black cover, the manufacturer's slogan, \"Five Star\u2014In a Class By Itself,\" hinted at what would become of the musical that began as penciled scrawls on the lined pages.",
      "Maguire had created, as the author himself described it, a dense, almost nineteenth-century-type novel that takes place over thirty-eight years and has thirty-eight speaking parts. Could any group of musical collaborators successfully distill these ingredients into a viable evening of theater?",

    "summary": "When the \"Star Trek\" actor and America's favorite astrophysicist share the stage, sparks can fly on an astronomical level. They talk about their bromance built on an appreciation of science and curiosity.",
    "story": [
      "Not long ago in Seattle, an astronomical event of sorts happened: Two superstars collided. William Shatner, of \"Star Trek\" fame, and Neil deGrasse Tyson, America's favorite astrophysicist, took to the stage to explore the nature of exploration. Think of it as sort of Martin & Lewis, but with more quantum mechanics.",
      "\"It's a bromance,\" said Tyson. \"I think what Bill Shatner and I have together should be the textbook definition of the bromance.\"",
      "\"If we have a bromance,\" said Shatner, \"I'd be very privileged.\"",
      "The two grew close last year on an upscale cruise to Antarctica, where they ended up being the after-dinner entertainment. \"The organizer said, 'Why don't we put the two of you on this mini-stage that they have on the ship, and we just chew the fat?'\" said Tyson. \"And then the organizer said, 'Why don't you guys take this on the road?'\"",
      "Their first port of call? Seattle, where they debuted a wide-ranging, sometimes meandering, but always intriguing stage show they're calling \"The Universe Is Absurd!\"",
      "When Shatner asked his partner for a sound bite, deGrasse Tyson solicited a suggestion from the audience: \"Pick anything out of the universe. Go. Anything. Doesn't matter.\"",
      "\"Pluto!\" yelled one enthusiastic audience member.",
      "DeGrasse Tyson obliged: \"More than half of Pluto is made of ice, so that, if it were where Earth is right now, heat from the Sun would evaporate that ice and it would grow a tail. And that is no kind of behavior for a planet!\" Mic drop. \"That's a sound bite!\"",
      "For deGrasse Tyson, director of New York City's Hayden Planetarium, and an authority on just about everything we know about the universe, it's a chance to get inside the insatiably curious mind of the 94-year-old Shatner. \"What kind of magic potion is he drinking?\" deGrasse Tyson laughed. \"By the way, you can do the math, he's been alive for three billion seconds, okay? I did the math, you don't have to. So when Bill Shatner speaks, it's coming from a place way deeper than any of the rest of us can possibly match.\"",
      "And for Shatner, who never formally studied astrophysics, it's a chance to make up for what he sees as lost time. \"I feel bad about it, because that knowledge of what constitutes the construction of nature, we know so little, but the little we know is so awesome, it's so spellbinding,\" he said. \"The fact that I wasn't conscious of how spellbinding it is as a youth, I could have been much more educated about it.\"",
      "Four years ago, Shatner became the oldest person ever to go into space, and he's been globetrotting ever since.",
      "Shatner asked deGrasse Tyson, \"Do you still scratch your head in awe?\"",
      "\"Every night I look up,\" he replied.",
      "So, is this the dynamic between the two \u2013 Shatner with questions, deGrasse Tyson with answers? \"Unfortunately, that's the way it is,\" Shatner replied.",
      "\"No, but he's got wisdom and life experience that I value, and I respect,\" deGrasse Tyson added. \"So, I'm here to grab some of that.\"",
      "As for Shatner's take on deGrasse Tyson, \"He has access, both because of his mentality, and the books and the studies, so he's into modern-day mysticism, which is the study of the stars and how it works and what goes on.\"",
      "\"You call that modern-day mysticism?\" deGrasse Tyson asked.",
      "\"Because you don't know for sure that what you're saying is absolutely truth until more experimentation.\"",
      "\"That's the frontier. We're scratching our heads.\"",
      "\"Exactly,\" said Shatner. \"So, he is an explorer. He is an explorer. He is on that verge. He teaches that. And it is mystical in every sense of the word.\"",
      "I asked, \"This is where I think you are politely and respectfully in disagreement, because Dr. deGrasse Tyson will say something like, 'We know what the speed of light is and what the fastest things can move is.' And you say, 'Well, we'll see about that!'\"",
      "\"Yeah, we've had that argument,\" said Shatner.",
      "DeGrasse Tyson seems just fine not knowing everything \u2013 for example, what was going on before the Big Bang, and the profound idea of somethingness coming from nothingness. \"We don't know. Next question!\" he said. \"No, as a scientist, you need to be comfortable in the presence of a question that does not yet have an answer.\"",
      "Of course, the ultimate question, the one we really don't know definitively, is where we go when we die, something that Shatner, as he loses friends and colleagues, finds himself considering more often. \"You know, I vary between the fear of death, my fear,\" he said. But, \"I have so much love around me. I have a wife, and children, and grandchildren. I even have two great-grandchildren. And I have two great dogs. I've had dogs all my life, all my adult life. And so, all my life is fertile, is vibrant. And I don't want to leave it. And that's the sadness. I don't want to go.\"",
      "\"Are you curious, though, about what you will find out?\" I asked.",
      "\"Not enough to die!\" he laughed.",
      "\"Even your curiosity has a limit?\"",
      "\"Right. It stops right there!\"",
      "So, William Shatner's famous curiosity bumps up against the edge of his universe. And as the show wrapped up in Seattle, Shatner closed things out with one of his unique spoken-word songs, accompanied by trumpeter Keyon Harrold.",
      "Do not grow oldno matter how long you live.Do not forget painbut somehow learn to forgive.",
      "The universe, it turns out, might be a bit absurd, but what an interesting ride!",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Nov 2025 09:42:46 -0500",
    "summary": "The composer and lyricist behind such hits as \"Godspell,\" \"Pippin\" and \"Wicked\" talks about the price of his early success, and why he almost left composing Broadway musicals for good.",
    "story": [
      "When songwriter Stephen Schwartz sits at the piano, he feels the music. \"When I was a kid and playing my Beethoven \u2026 I would play that bar over and over again, and cry. It's very embarrassing! Beethoven, living in a world that has nothing to do with ours, but he writes, and it speaks to us across the centuries.\"",
      "Schwartz knows a little something about speaking to audiences. He's the composer and lyricist of \"Wicked,\" the blockbuster stage musical-turned-two-part movie musical. Part two, \"Wicked: For Good,\" opens Nov. 21.",
      "The prequel to the classic \"Wizard of Oz,\" \"Wicked\" tells the story of Elphaba (played by Cynthia Erivo), who grows up to be the Wicked Witch of the West. The bubbly Glinda (played by Ariana Grande) becomes the Good Witch of the North.",
      "Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo perform \"Popular,\" from \"Wicked\":",
      "Schwartz has been telling stories through song for over five decades. \"My sort of glib joke where people say, like, how do you write a song? I just say, tell the truth and make it rhyme,\" he said. \"And if I can be honest enough, then that'll speak to other people.\"",
      "\"Wicked\" opened 22 years ago, making it the fourth-longest-running Broadway show in history.",
      "And where was Schwartz on the night of Oct. 30, 2003? \"Well, that was the opening night of 'Wicked' on Broadway, and therefore, I was not at the Gershwin Theatre, because I don't go to my own openings,\" he said. \"It's too nerve-wracking for me. I don't like the opening night parties where everybody is just waiting to hear what reviews come in.\"",
      "Kristin Chenoweth originated the role of Glinda on Broadway. She and Schwartz have reunited for the recently-opened new musical, \"The Queen of Versailles.\" \"I'm working with my Rodgers and Hammerstein; it's just packed into one person,\" she said of Schwartz. \"There's not five of him. There's one. He's original. He's singular. And there's nobody else like him.\"",
      "Schwartz grew up on New York's Long Island. A prodigy, he attended the prestigious Juilliard School as a high schooler. Just after college, he collaborated on the musical that became his first big hit, \"Godspell.\" The musical features a ragtag group who help Jesus tell various parables.",
      "I asked, \"It's a musical with Jesus as a central character. You're a Jewish guy. Did you think, well, alright, I'll give it a go?\"",
      "Schwartz replied, \"I think one of the things that made 'Godspell' work was the fact that I didn't know a lot of those stories. So, I think I came to it with a kind of fresh eye about not preaching to the converted, so to speak.\"",
      "In 1972, Schwartz brought that fresh eye to the story of \"Pippin,\" a young man searching for the meaning of life in the Middle Ages. Hit #3, 1974's \"The Magic Show,\" starred magician Doug Henning. Schwartz was 3-for-3, with all three playing simultaneously on Broadway when he was just 27 \u2013 a theatrical trifecta that Schwartz described as \"very dizzying.\"",
      "\"The truth is, when you are very young and unprepared for a success, it can be difficult to handle,\" he said. \"It was difficult for me to handle. I think I got very, quite full of myself. I got kind of difficult to deal with. I kept thinking, well, why isn't everybody just doing exactly what I say? I lost somewhat the ability to collaborate. You know, it took some failures to kind of learn how to deal with both success and failure.\"",
      "The failures came in short order, a \"four-fecta\" of flops\": \"Working\" (which closed after a month), and 'Rags\" (which closed after four performances), while \"The Baker's Wife\" and \"Children of Eden\" never made it to Broadway.",
      "I noted, \"You haven't always been critic's choice.\"",
      "\"I'm almost never a critic's choice,\" Schwartz said.",
      "Why? \"I have no idea,\" he said. \"I'll be frank about it, you know, I wish I got Steve Sondheim's reviews.\"",
      "\"But listen, as great as he was, his shows didn't run the way yours have.\"",
      "\"Yeah, the grass is always greener,\" Schwartz replied.",
      "In the early 1990s Schwartz stepped away from the piano. Had he quit Broadway? \"Absolutely, a hundred percent,\" he said.",
      "\"Did you worry that you were out of juice?\" I asked.",
      "\"Totally, yeah. And in the '90s, I actually went back to school. I was pursuing a degree in psychology. I was gonna become a therapist.\"",
      "Studying to become a therapist turned out to be quite therapeutic. \"I think that time away reminded me of how to behave myself and how to collaborate and how to deal with other people, and not just come in like a bull in a china shop,\" he said.",
      "When he returned to songwriting, it was not for Broadway, though, but for Hollywood, writing songs for \"Pocahontas,\" \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame,\" \"Enchanted,\" and music and lyrics for \"The Prince of Egypt.\" He picked up three Academy Awards along the way.",
      "\"The Colors of the Wind,\" from \"Pocahontas\":",
      "But Stephen Schwartz's home will always be the stage. \"I feel so blessed and so fortunate that work I've done has this ongoing life that I know is gonna keep going when I'm not here on this planet anymore,\" he said. \"Listen, I'm 77 years old, and they still let me do this!\"",

      "The event, organized by the Vatican's culture ministry, took place in a frescoed Vatican audience hall. Leo called on the attending artists to use their art to include marginalized voices and praised film to console and challenge audiences.",
      "\"It articulates the questions that dwell within us, and sometimes, even provokes tears that we did not know we needed to express,\" Leo said.",
      "The first U.S.-born pope also acknowledged the financial difficulties facing movie theaters. He said institutions should not give up, but \"cooperate in affirming the social and cultural value\" of theaters, drawing applause from the audience.",
      "\"His speech was beautiful and very inspiring, about hope and our work in cinema. We're glad we came,\" said Judd Apatow, who attended the audience with his wife and fellow Hollywood star Leslie Mann.",
      "\"It was so inspiring,\" Mann added.",
      "Leo spent nearly an hour greeting guests and making conversation with each attendee. Lee, a basketball lover, gifted the pontiff a New York Knicks jersey that featured the No. 14 and Leo's name on the back. Leo may be a known Chicago Bulls fan, but Lee said he told the pope that the Knicks' current roster includes three players from Villanova University, the Holy Father's alma mater.

Vatican officials used contacts in Hollywood, including Martin Scorsese, to help craft the list of attendees. The hardest part, Tighe said, was convincing Hollywood agents that the invitation wasn't a hoax. Tighe told CBS Saturday Morning that he hopes the event shows that the Church embraces the arts, instead of just tolerating them.",
      "\"We have to trust that the artist, even when he or she is being provocative, is trying to wake us up, grab our attention, and make us think about things that are important,\" Tighe said.",

The official also pointed to a decrease in the amount of oil departing from Russia to unknown destinations and said transaction volume has decreased.",
      "The sanctions, announced Oct. 22, target Russian oil giants Lukoil and Rosneft. They represent the first direct actions against Russia of the second Trump administration and some of the most aggressive since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. Since the announcement, nearly a dozen major Indian and Chinese purchasers of Russian oil have stated intentions to pause their purchases of Russian oil deliveries for December, Treasury has said.",
      "A November 17 memo from the Treasury's Sanctions Economic Analysis Division assessed that the \"sanctions on Russian energy firms Lukoil and Rosneft are having their intended effect of dampening Russian revenues by lowering the price of Russian oil and therefore the country's ability to fund its war effort against Ukraine.\"",
      "The memo said that several grades of Russian oil are trading at multi-year lows, and are \"well below all other international prices.\"",
      "The memo also indicated that sanctions are \"likely to have a long-term negative impact on the quantity of Russian oil sold.\"",
      "The sanctions set a Friday, Nov. 21, deadline for companies to wind down dealings with Rosneft and Lukoil. Nearly three dozen entities are petitioning Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control for additional time to wind down operations, which would take them beyond the original deadline. That is not unusual, as companies work to comply with U.S. sanctions.",
      "Treasury has issued some extensions already for certain transactions involving Lukoil's retail service stations and contracts for the sale of the firm's international assets until Dec. 13. A separate waiver for deals pertaining to Lukoil's entities in Bulgaria was extended through April 29, according to a CBS review of the licenses.",
      "A Treasury official also said Thursday that many Chinese and Indian entities \u2014 including banks and refineries \u2014 are conscious of the sanctions and are \"risk averse, do recognize the importance of the relationships with the West, and are moving to comply.\"",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last month the sanctions on Russia's largest oil companies were driven by President Vladimir Putin's \"refusal to end this senseless war.\" Treasury said the companies have helped to \"fund the Kremlin's war machine.\"",
      "Last month on CBS News' \"Face the Nation,\" Bessent told moderator Margaret Brennan that the latest actions could cut Russia's oil revenue 20% or 30%. A Treasury official said the impacts are still being assessed, but that \"it is clear that there will be revenue impacts\" from the sanctions.",
      "The oil price plunge comes as President Trump presses Russia and Ukraine to reach a ceasefire. At various points, he has expressed frustration with the leaders of both countries.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 16:47:44 -0500",
    "summary": "Criminals are targeting shoppers with fake websites, bogus charities and other fraudulent pitches, according to insights from Visa.",
    "story": [
      "The holiday shopping season is creating fresh openings for scammers looking to snag consumers' payment data, according to Visa's 2025 Holiday Threats Report.",
      "Artificial intelligence is also helping criminals move faster and reach more victims, according to Visa's scam disruption team. AI tools can generate authentic-sounding text for fake websites that look legitimate but are designed to steal your information.",
      "\"Just as regular consumers are excited for shopping season, scammers are also excited, because it gives them opportunities to capitalize on these feelings, and illicitly gather payment data, or other personal information from unsuspecting victims,\" Michael Jabbara, global head of fraud services at Visa, told CBS News.",
      "Here are five of the most common types of scams to watch for this holiday season, according to Visa.",
      "Fake retail websites",
      "Websites that appear authentic but have been constructed for the sole purpose of scamming customers are proliferating, according to Visa. These sites can closely mimic popular companies, duping shoppers into handing over credit card information.",
      "Sometimes they ship shoddy goods to customers, but in other cases, they don't bother sending anything.",
      "Jabbara said it can be difficult to distinguish between legitimate and copycat sites, and that it's wise to do extra research if your gut instinct says something is awry.",
      "\"Scammers do this for a living and are very good at it. You don't want to underestimate them,\" Jabbara said. \"If a consumer has a feeling that a deal is too good to be true, or a website looks fishy, do some validation.\"",
      "That can include looking at online reviews of the site or going directly to the business's site by typing in its URL, versus clicking on a social media site. For example, open a web browser and type in Gap.com, as opposed to clicking a link in a digital ad promoting T-shirts.",
      "Package delivery scams",
      "Scam artists are sending consumers texts claiming there is a \"delivery problem\" with an online order they probably didn't place. Criminals posing as package delivery services like UPS or FedEx tell consumers they must turn over their credit card information to receive a phony delivery.",
      "This type of scam proliferates around the holidays, when consumers make more online purchases and shippers deal with higher-than-normal volumes of packages, Visa notes.",
      "Criminals may sell and trade your personal information on the dark web, or enroll you in recurring billing cycles you never signed up for. Some consumers might not catch these issues if they don't pay close attention to their credit card statements, according to Visa.",
      "\"They input your payment information into a form and monetize it on different channels,\" Jabbara said.",
      "Jabbara advises that consumers never click on links from unknown senders.",
      "Paying for seasonal work",
      "Fake job offers also crop up during the holidays, when many Americans are trying to earn extra cash to cover gift-giving and travel. Scammers take advantage of that financial pressure.",
      "Visa advises job seekers to apply only through a company's official channels and to avoid any role that requires upfront payments.",
      "\"We see 'job offers' that tell workers they have to pay a fee to apply, or for a background check,\" Jabbara said. \"That is a surefire sign of a scam.\"",
      "Consumers should also verify that any company they're applying to is legitimate, he added.",
      "Travel-related fraud",
      "Scammers are also creating fake travel sites and sending phishing emails targeting people with holiday travel plans.",
      "Make sure to make reservations through trusted travel sites, and if a deal appears to be too good to be true, it probably is. Looking at reviews can help determine if a site is legitimate, Jabbara advises.",
      "Charity scams",
      "The year-end giving season also attracts scammers who exploit people's generosity by setting up phony charities.",
      "Fraudsters may build convincing websites or approach people in person with tap-to-donate schemes, Visa said. As with other scams, it's wise to confirm a charity's legitimacy before donating.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-december-2025-rate-cut-probability-fomc-meeting-economy/",
    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 15:10:43 -0500",
    "summary": "The government's latest jobs data could affect whether Federal Reserve officials continue their push to ease borrowing costs.",
    "story": [
      "Just a few weeks ago, a December interest rate cut was viewed as practically a done deal by many economists. Now, with fresh government data showing solid U.S.\u00a0job growth in September, many forecasters think the Federal Reserve is likely to hold off lowering borrowing costs when policy makers meet next month.",
      "The probability of a Federal Reserve rate cut now stands at 22%, down from a likelihood of 97% as of mid-October, according to economists polled by financial data company FactSet. CME Fedwatch, a tool that forecasts rate cuts based on changes in the 30-Day Fed Funds futures prices, gives slightly better odds of a reduction, at about 41%.",
      "Translation: Wall Street economists and traders alike expect the Fed to leave rates unchanged at its next two-day meeting on Dec. 9-10. That would amount to a pause in the central bank's recent move to lower lending rates, coming after two consecutive cuts in September and October.",
      "The shift in expectations for future Fed rate cuts follows a six-week blackout in federal economic data because of the\u00a0government shutdown, a hiatus that hindered the central bank's ability to assess key economic trends. Last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that a December rate cut wasn't a \"foregone conclusion,\" pointing to signs that the job market remains on firm ground.",
      "The Fed is more likely to lower its benchmark federal funds rate \u2014 or what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 if officials conclude that the job market and broader economic growth are in danger of stalling. But Thursday's jobs data showed that employers continued to hire at a healthy clip in September.",
      "\"Given that today's numbers were not a bad as feared, in conjunction with hawkish statements from the Fed recently, it does appear that the Fed will skip a cut in December,\" Preston Caldwell, chief U.S. economist at Morningstar, said in an email.",
      "He added, \"But with the negative trend in labor markets remaining in place, we'd expect the Fed to resume cutting in their next meeting in January 2026, if they don't cut this December.\"",
      "The federal funds rate is currently sitting in a range of 3.75% to 4%.",
      "A move by the Fed to dial back rate cuts in 2026 could keep borrowing costs for homes and cars elevated. Pricier mortgages and auto loans are also reinforcing the feeling among many Americans, reflected in sentiment polls, that the cost of living remains too high.",
      "Mixed economic picture",
      "The Federal Reserve's so-called dual mandate requires monetary policymakers to keep both inflation and unemployment in check. The central bank cited the slowing labor market when it twice trimmed borrowing costs this fall.",
      "But the latest payroll gains released Thursday showed that employers hired 119,000 people in September \u2014 more than double what most economists had forecast. The nation's unemployment rate ticked up from 4.3% to 4.4%, the highest level since October of 2021. The increase in the jobless rate suggests more people are re-entering the workforce to search for a job, economists said.",
      "At the same time, inflation has edged up, climbing at an annual rate of 3% in September. That puts pressure on the Fed to keep price increases from spiraling higher, with some policymakers expressing concern over persistent inflation.",
      "The mixed economic picture is complicated by the absence of more recent official data. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said\u00a0this week that it will fold some October jobs data into its November report, which is set for release after the Fed's next meeting, on Dec. 16.",
      "\"September's payroll numbers may have surprised to the upside, but in terms of the Fed's December interest rate decision, October is what mattered,\" Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said in an email. \"With that data now delayed until after the FOMC meeting, the Fed's rate-cut path has more question marks.\"",
      "She added, \"Overall, the available economic data has supported a December cut, but given the Fed's cautious bent, it may choose to wait until it has more numbers in hand.\"",

      "Investment advisor firm Capital Economics estimates 150,000 federal workers will drop off the government's payroll in the fourth quarter this year, mainly due to the end of the Trump administration's deferred resignation programs.",
      "The job market has been losing momentum for much of this year, with previous employment reports indicating a slowdown in hiring.

      "The hiring numbers will shape Federal Reserve officials' decision on whether to cut interest rates at their next meeting in December. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at investment firm B. Riley Financial, thinks the odds of a rate cut have \"diminished significantly\" given there will not be a full October employment report and the November report won't be issued until after the Fed meets in December.",
      "Ashworth expects the Fed to delay its next rate cut until January. The probability of a rate cut now stands at 22%, according to economists polled by FactSet.",
      "Delayed employment reports",
      "The September jobs report, originally slated for Oct. 3, was pushed back by the government shutdown that ended on Nov. 12. The delay means it offers a belated snapshot of the labor market just before federal funding lapsed on Oct. 1.",
      "On Tuesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said it won't publish the full October employment report, which was originally slated for release on Nov. 7. Instead, the agency will fold select October data into the November report, which is set for release on Dec. 16.",

    "title": "Despite complaints of gaps in Medicare Advantage networks, enforcement is rare",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/medicare-advantage-networks-complaints-federal-enforcement/",
    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 10:22:48 -0500",
    "summary": "Government documents show that federal regulators rarely warn plans that their networks of health providers are so skimpy they violate legal requirements.",
    "story": [
      "Along with the occasional aches and pains, growing older can bring surprise setbacks and serious diseases. Longtime relationships with doctors people trust often make even bad news more tolerable. Losing that support \u2014 especially during a health crisis \u2014 can be terrifying. That's why little-known federal requirements are supposed to protect people with privately run Medicare Advantage coverage when contract disputes lead their health care providers and insurers to part ways.",
      "But government documents obtained by KFF Health News show the agency overseeing Medicare Advantage does little to enforce long-standing rules intended to ensure about 35 million plan members can see doctors in the first place.",
      "In response to a Freedom of Information Act request covering the past decade, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services produced letters it sent to only five insurers from 2016 to 2022 after seven of their plans failed to meet provider network adequacy requirements \u2014 lapses that could, in some cases, harm patient care.",
      "Agency officials said some plans lacked enough primary care clinicians, specialists, or hospitals, according to the letters. And they warned that failure to meet the requirements could result in a freeze on marketing and enrollment, fines, or closure of the plan.",
      "CMS declined to detail why it found so few plans with network violations over the 10 years. \"The number of identified violations reflects the outcomes of targeted reviews, not a comprehensive audit of all plans in all years,\" said Catherine Howden, a CMS spokesperson.",
      "Officials in states with Advantage network violations say CMS didn't notify them, including directors of the government-funded State Health Insurance Assistance Program, which helps people navigate Medicare.",
      "\"It's hard for me to believe that only seven Medicare Advantage plans violated network rules,\" said David Lipschutz, a co-director of the Center for Medicare Advocacy, a nonprofit group. \"We often hear from folks \u2014 particularly in more rural areas \u2014 who have to travel significant distances in order to find contracted providers.\"",
      "Medicare Advantage is an increasingly popular alternative to the government-run Medicare program, which covers adults 65 and older and some people with disabilities. Of the 63 million Americans who were eligible to join Advantage plans instead of traditional Medicare, 54% did so for this year. The plans usually offer lower out-of-pocket costs and extra benefits, like coverage for vision, dental, and hearing care, but typically require their members to stick to select networks of doctors, hospitals, and other providers. Last year, the federal government paid Advantage plans an estimated $494 billion to care for patients.",
      "Traditional Medicare, by comparison, has no network and is accepted by nearly all doctors and hospitals in the nation.",
      "Conflicts between Medicare Advantage plans and the doctors, hospitals, and other providers that serve their members are common. Just this year, at least 38 hospital systems serving all or parts of 23 states have cut ties with at least 11 Advantage plans after failing to agree on payment and other issues, according to a review of news releases and press reports. Over the past three years, separations between Advantage plans and health systems have increased 66%, said FTI Consulting, which tracks reports of the disputes.",
      "After March, Medicare Advantage beneficiaries are generally locked into their plans for the year until the annual open enrollment period happening now through Dec. 7, for coverage beginning Jan. 1. But hospitals, doctors, pharmacies, and other health providers can leave plans anytime.",
      "When providers and insurers separate, Advantage members can lose access to longtime doctors or preferred hospitals in the middle of the year. In response, CMS sometimes gives Advantage customers a little-known escape hatch called a \"special enrollment period\" to change plans or enroll in traditional Medicare midyear.",
      "How CMS decides who gets an SEP is a mystery even to well-versed state insurance regulators and U.S. senators who oversee federal health programs. Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, and Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) cited previous KFF Health News reporting on Medicare Advantage in an Oct. 30 letter asking CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz for an explanation.",
      "\"Despite the serious impacts of SEPs on enrollees and the market, the process of SEP determinations is opaque, leaving enrollees and state regulators in the dark,\" they wrote.",
      "\"Seniors deserve to know their Medicare plan isn't going to pull the rug out from under them halfway through the year,\" Wyden told KFF Health News.",
      "\"Help us\"",
      "Oz spoke to Medicare Advantage insurers Oct. 15 at a conference organized by the Better Medicare Alliance, a trade group, and encouraged them to help CMS police fraud in the program.",
      "\"Be our early-warning system,\" he told them. \"Tell us about problems you're witnessing. Help us figure out better ways of addressing it.\"",
      "When he finished speaking, he took a seat in the audience next to the president and chief executive of the group, Mary Beth Donahue, and smiled for photos.",
      "In six letters KFF Health News obtained, CMS officials told five insurers that their network adequacy violations could affect Advantage members' access to care. Five letters listed the number or types of medical specialists or facilities missing from the networks. In three cases, CMS noted that plans could request exceptions to the rules but didn't. In one letter, CMS requested the plan allow members to receive out-of-network care at no additional cost. Four letters required specific steps to address deficiencies, including submitting evidence that more clinicians were added to networks.",
      "Three letters required a \"corrective action plan,\" set deadlines for fixing problems, and warned that failure to comply with the rules could result in enrollment and marketing suspensions, fines, or forced plan closure. The other three letters were a \"notice of non-compliance,\" which urged insurers to comply with legal requirements.",
      "Although CMS regards the letters as the first step in its enforcement process, the agency did not provide information about whether these violations were resolved or if they resulted in penalties.",
      "The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, a group created by Congress to monitor the program, said in a June 2024 report that \"CMS has the authority to impose intermediate sanctions or civil monetary penalties for noncompliance with network adequacy standards, but it has never done so.\"",
      "One of the network adequacy violation letters went to Vitality Health Plan of California in November 2020. That came after five hospitals and 13 nursing homes in one county and four hospitals in another all left the insurer's network, according to the letter from Timothy Roe, then-director of CMS' Division of Compliance, Surveillance, and Marketing. Two months before sending its letter, CMS granted Vitality plan members a special enrollment period.",
      "Beneficiaries welcomed the opportunity, said Marcelo Espiritu, program manager of the Santa Clara County office of California's Health Insurance Counseling & Advocacy Program. But Espiritu didn't know at the time that Vitality's depleted network violated CMS requirements, which Roe said put \"the health of Vitality's beneficiaries at risk.\"",
      "\"By not having enough network providers, beneficiaries may not be able to receive necessary services timely, or at all,\" Roe wrote.",
      "That's information patients need to know, Espiritu said.",
      "\"People would not be able to receive promised benefits and there would be delays in care and a lot of frustration in trying to find a new plan,\" he said. \"We would certainly warn people about the plan and remove it from our materials.\"",
      "Representatives from Commonwealth Care Alliance, which acquired Vitality in 2022, did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Network minimums",
      "Federal law requires Medicare Advantage plans to include in their networks a minimum of 29 types of health care providers and 14 kinds of facilities that members can access within certain distances and travel times. The rules, which vary depending on a county's population and density, also limit how long patients should wait for appointments. The agency checks compliance every three years, or more often if it receives complaints.",
      "Networks can vary widely even within a county because the provider minimums apply to the insurer, not each plan it sells, according to a report from KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. The company can offer the same network to members of multiple plans in one or more counties or create a separate network for each plan.",
      "In Arizona's Maricopa County, KFF researchers found, UnitedHealthcare offered 12 plans with 12 different networks in 2022. Depending on the plan, the company's customers had access to 37% to 61% of the physicians in the area available to traditional Medicare enrollees.",
      "In early 2016, CMS allowed 900 people in an Advantage plan in Illinois run by Harmony, then a WellCare subsidiary, to leave after the Christie Clinic, a large medical practice, left its provider network. The WellCare plan continued to operate without the clinic. But in June 2016, CMS told the plan in one of the letters KFF Health News obtained that losing the Christie Clinic meant the remaining provider network violated federal requirements.",
      "It was \"a significant network change with substantial enrollee impact,\" the letter said.",
      "Claudia Lennhoff, executive director at Champaign County Health Care Consumers, a government-funded Medicare counseling service that helped the WellCare members, said her group didn't know about the letter at the time.",
      "\"Not disclosing such information is a violation of trust,\" Lennhoff said. \"It could lead someone to make a decision that will be harmful to them, or that they will deeply regret.\"",
      "Centene Corp. bought WellCare in 2020, and representatives for the St. Louis-based company declined to comment on events that occurred before the acquisition.",
      "Two violation letters KFF Health News obtained from CMS went to Provider Partners Health Plan of Ohio in 2019 and 2022. The Ohio Department of Insurance was unaware of the violations, spokesperson Todd Walker said. He said CMS also did not notify the Ohio Senior Health Insurance Information Program, the state's free counseling service.",
      "Rick Grindrod, CEO and president of Provider Partners Health Plans, which is based in Maryland, said that after CMS reviewed its 2019 network, \"we proactively reduced our service area and deferred enrollment in the plan until 2021.\"",
      "But Grindrod said the plan enrolled only a small number of members in one county in 2021 and decided to withdraw from the Ohio market entirely at the end of that year.",
      "After Provider Partners withdrew from Ohio, CMS sent it another letter in March 2022 saying its network in 2021 had gaps in four counties for four types of providers and facilities. CMS asked the plan to comply with network rules by adding more providers.",
      "\"We believe CMS' network adequacy standards are generally clear and appropriate for ensuring beneficiary access,\" Grindrod said. \"While the standards are not difficult to understand, as a provider-sponsored plan with a small footprint, we sometimes face challenges securing contracts with large systems that prioritize larger Medicare Advantage plans.\"",
      "In 2021, CMS also sent a violation letter to North Carolina's Liberty Advantage. CMS didn't tell the state's free counseling service, the Seniors' Health Insurance Information Program, about the letter, said its director, Melinda Munden.",
      "Liberty representatives did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "CMS sent a letter in 2016 to CareSource about network deficiencies in some of its Medicare Advantage plans sold in Kentucky and Indiana. The agency asked the company to fix the problems, including by reimbursing any members billed for services from doctors who were not in the plans' networks.",
      "\"In response to the 2016 violations, we promptly implemented a Corrective Action Plan, which included a thorough review of our provider network to ensure adequacy standards were met,\" said Vicki McDonald, a CareSource spokesperson. \"CMS approved our plan, and no further action was required.\"",
      "KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF \u2014 the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.",

    "summary": "The former Treasury secretary said he's resigning from the board of OpenAI after last week's release of emails\u200b between him and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein\u200b.",
    "story": [
      "Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said Wednesday he is resigning from the board of OpenAI and leaving a number of other roles after last week's release of emails between him and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"In line with my announcement to step away from my public commitments, I have also decided to resign from the board of OpenAI,\" Summers said in a statement.",
      "\"I am grateful for the opportunity to have served, excited about the potential of the company and look forward to following their progress,\" he said.",
      "On Wednesday night, Summers went on leave from teaching at Harvard University, with his spokesperson, Steven Goldberg, saying in a statement: \"Mr. Summers has decided it's in the best interest of the Center for him to go on leave from his role as Director as Harvard undertakes its review. His co-teachers will complete the remaining three class sessions of the courses he has been teaching with them this semester, and he is not scheduled to teach next semester.\" A Harvard spokesperson said Summers \"communicated his decision\" to the university.",
      "Summers said earlier this week that he will be stepping back from \"public commitments\" after dozens of messages between him and Epstein were included in a trove of documents from Epstein's estate that was released by the House Oversight Committee last week.",

      "Summers joined the OpenAI board in 2023.",
      "The emails showed Summers and Epstein communicated regularly during the last years of Epstein's life, even as the accused sex trafficker's public infamy and notoriety grew. Many of the messages were from the late 2010s, well after Epstein pleaded guilty to prostitution charges in Florida, but before he was charged with sex trafficking in federal court and taken into custody in July 2019.",
      "The exchanges between Summers and Epstein include one in which they appeared to banter about a woman Summers knew in London, with Epstein seeming to offer him advice.",
      "There is no evidence of illegal conduct on the part of Summers.",
      "Summers, who served as Treasury Secretary in the Clinton administration, was a key economic adviser in the Obama administration. The former president of Harvard University, Summers was teaching two classes at the school.",

    "summary": "The chipmaker's record growth will allay investor concerns about an artificial intelligence bubble, analysts say.",
    "story": [
      "Nvidia's third-quarter financial results on Wednesday surpassed analyst expectations, signaling that demand for its artificial intelligence chips remains robust amid investor concerns about an AI bubble.",
      "The chipmaker reported earnings of $31.9 billion on record revenue of $57 billion for the third quarter. Revenue for the period surged 22% from the previous quarter and 62% from a year ago. Its earnings per share were $1.30. The Santa Clara, Calif., company had been expected to earn $1.26 per share on revenue of $54.9 billion for the quarter, according to analysts polled by FactSet.",
      "\"Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement\u00a0on Wednesday, referring to the company's proprietary superchips that power large language models.",
      "\"Compute demand keeps accelerating and compounding across training and inference \u2014 each growing exponentially. We've entered the virtuous cycle of AI. The AI ecosystem is scaling fast \u2014 with more new foundation model makers, more AI startups, across more industries, and in more countries. AI is going everywhere, doing everything, all at once,\" Huang added.",
      "Nvidia forecast revenue of $65 billion for the fourth quarter. The company's shares, which have jumped 39% this year, rose nearly 4% in after-hours trading to $193.80.",
      "\"This is a huge print and guidance from Nvidia that should reignite the bullish tech trade into year-end,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a note to investors, adding that he thinks \"fears of an AI Bubble are way overstated.",
      "In October, the chipmaker became the first publicly listed company worth $5 trillion, with its shares buoyed by Wall Street expectations of surging demand.",
      "Rational exuberance?",
      "In recent weeks, some investors have expressed caution about the hype surrounding AI and whether the soaring market value of companies linked to the technology is warranted. Despite the promise of AI, most companies that are implementing AI have yet to see a measurable increase in productivity or profits, according to Wall Street analysts.",
      "\"Nvidia earnings are such an important event both because of the weighting that the stock has in the major equity indices and because it is ground zero for the entire Artificial Intelligence build out,\" Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, said in an email.",
      "The rapid construction of data centers across the U.S. has boosted demand for Nvidia's chips. Data center investment, which includes spending on AI research and development, has become the largest contributor to U.S. growth this year, according to S&P Global.",
      "The S&P 500's 15% gain this year has been driven largely by big tech companies with AI investments. The combined market capitalization of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" \u2014 Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla \u2014 accounts for 37% of the index's total value,\u00a0according\u00a0to Morningstar.",
      "\"Market psychology has been negative this month as investors worried that the artificial intelligence infrastructure build out was a bubble, and in a few years we may look back at this time and point to signs that it was, Zaccarelli said. \"But in the meantime, the largest technology companies in the world are extremely profitable, and they are reinvesting billions of dollars into data centers, servers and chips, and the spending is real.\"",
      "China hurdle",
      "Nvidia reported robust demand for its chips despite being blocked from the vital Chinese market because of U.S. export restrictions as the two nations compete on AI.",
      "In an earnings call with analysts, Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Collete Kress on Wednesday said the company is \"disappointed\" it can't ship products to China.",
      "\"To establish a sustainable leadership and position in AI computing, America must win the support of every developer and be the platform of choice for every commercial business, including those in China,\" she said, adding that Nvidia will continue to push for access to the Chinese market.",

    "summary": "Although inflation has eased, many Americans say they still feel squeezed financially. Here are five areas where households are feeling the pinch.",
    "story": [
      "Although inflation across the U.S. is far cooler than in the post-pandemic years, millions of Americans say they still feel the pinch of rising prices, struggle to pay the bills and express concern about their financial prospects.",
      "Price increases are nowhere near the level reached in June of 2022, when the Consumer Price Index hit a 40-year high of 9.1%. Yet many people feel squeezed by the cost of simple daily necessities, including the ability to afford healthy food, and by long-term increases in the cost of essentials such as housing and health care.",
      "This affordability crisis is rooted in a combination of both longstanding economic issues dating back decades and more recent developments. For instance, housing costs have surged partly due to a lack of available homes, a result of cutbacks in construction following the Great Recession, while more recently steep new U.S. tariffs have fueled inflation.",
      "Inflation and the economy now rank as Americans' top national concerns, according to an October CBS News poll.",
      "\"Everything is going up in price very quickly,\" said Jeremy Tolbert, a 47-year-old web developer in Lawrence, Kansas.",
      "With his family's monthly health care premiums set to rise 18% to $2,600 next year, he's planning to cut back in other areas. \"Our food budget is going to go down \u2014 we're not talking about eating beans and rice, but going from a comfortable middle-class lifestyle to eating how we did when we first got out of college,\" Tolbert said.",
      "Here are five key categories of spending that many Americans are struggling to afford.",
      "Food",
      "Almost half of Americans say it's harder to afford groceries today than it was a year ago, according to a September survey\u00a0by Axios and the Harris Poll. Only 19% said food prices are cheaper than a year earlier, with roughly a third seeing no change.",
      "Growth in food prices has eased considerably, although it is still rising, with the latest CPI report showing grocery prices rose 2.7% in September on an annual basis, a sharp contrast to the\u00a011.4% increase in 2022. Overall, however, food prices as of September were more than 18% higher than in January of 2022, according to the CBS News price tracker.",
      "Shoppers don't assess food costs the same way economists do. They focus on their day-to-day spending \u2014 which keeps climbing \u2014 and compare their out-of-pocket spending today with what they paid several years ago,\u00a0according to research from the University of Florida.",
      "In other words, people's experience of inflation and how they measure it in their daily lives may not mesh with official economic measures that paint a more optimistic picture.",
      "Meanwhile, other recent signals underscore the difficulty many Americans have simply putting food on the table. Roughly 14% of U.S. households reported food insecurity on average between January and October, up from 12.5% in 2024, according to data from Purdue University's Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability.",
      "In New York City, for example, 40% of local families can't afford their weekly food costs, according to new data from charitable organization Robin Hood and Columbia University.",
      "Housing",
      "Almost three-quarters of Americans said housing has grown more unaffordable in their communities in recent years, according to an October poll from YouGov and the University of Florida Center for Public Interest Communications.",
      "The data backs that up, with a homebuyer today needing to earn $121,400 a year to afford a typical home, meaning that their monthly costs would remain below 30% of their annual income, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. The average American earns about $84,000 a year, highlighting the considerable gap between incomes and home prices.",
      "Several forces have pushed housing costs higher. The rate of home construction plunged after the 2008-09 financial crisis, leading to a shortfall in housing inventory. Meeting today's demand for housing would require building as many as 4 million additional homes beyond current construction levels, Goldman Sachs estimates.",
      "The low interest rates that prevailed during the pandemic, when homebuyers could secure mortgages below 3%, sparked a buying rush that sent prices soaring. Even with a slight cooling this year, homes are selling for about 25% above their 2019 levels, while mortgage rates have more than doubled since their pandemic lows.",
      "Child care",
      "The challenge of affording child care is another pain point for many families. In 2024, the average annual cost of care for one child around the U.S. topped $13,000, up 30% from 2020, according to Child Care Aware America, a nonprofit group.",
      "Families with a single child can end up paying between roughly 9% and 16% of their median income on full-time day care,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Department of Labor. That means parents are often spending more on child care than they do on other expenses, such as groceries or even rent, data shows.",
      "Gina Monroe, a 42-year-old mom based in Massapequa, New York, said the financial strain of child care has made her and her husband think twice about having another child. She started sending her 2-year-old son to day care in September and pays around $450 a week.",
      "\"Nothing's getting any cheaper,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Child care costs have surged partly because there aren't enough early education workers to support the number of children who need care, according to experts. The industry also pays meager wages, adding to the challenges of recruiting new workers, said Keri Rodrigues, co-founder and president of the National Parents Union, an advocacy group for American families.",
      "Health care",
      "Americans are also getting socked by rising health care costs, ranging from higher insurance premiums to out-of-pocket expenses such as deductibles and co-pays. The increase in medical costs stems largely from the emergence of more expensive treatments, such as the popular GLP-1 weight loss drugs, as well as an aging population that requires more care, according to consulting firm Mercer.",
      "The cost of health care was at the center of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, with Democratic lawmakers pushing to extend a tax credit to defray the cost of health insurance for 22 million Americans who buy coverage through the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The shutdown ended without an agreement to extend the subsidies, which means low- and middle-income households that previously qualified for the tax credits would likely see their ACA premiums rise from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to a KFF\u00a0analysis.",
      "Employees who get their insurance through employer-based plans are likely to see their health care costs rise as much as 7% for their 2026 plans, according to Mercer.",
      "Electricity and utility costs",
      "Americans now pay an average of $265 per month in utility costs, up 12% since last year, according to a new\u00a0report from The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, and advocacy group Protect Borrowers.",
      "The surge stems from a succession of rate hikes across the U.S, as electricity demand outstrips supply. In 2025 alone, more than 124 million Americans are expected to see some sort of rate increase in their energy bill, a recent PowerLines\u00a0report\u00a0found.",
      "Even if you do your best to shut off every light, some fixed costs are unavoidable, such as the so-called \"delivery charge,\" or what a utility charges to send electricity from a power plant to a home, said Rodrigues of the National Parents Union.",
      "The energy burden falls most acutely on low- and middle-income families, who spend between 6% and 10% of their income on energy, or three to five times that of higher-income households, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association.",

      "Customers will be able to browse Target's selection and make purchases within the ChatGPT app, according to the retailer. The tool will debut next week, providing access to ChatGPT's 800 million weekly active users in time for the holiday shopping season.",
      "Target is leaning on price cuts and a $1 billion investment plan to revive its brand, the retailer said separately Wednesday, as same-store sales fell 2.7% in the latest quarter and profit tumbled 19%. With shoppers increasingly relying on AI to find products online, other big retailers \u2014 including Walmart, which struck a similar partnership with OpenAI last month \u2014 are turning to the technology to boost sales.",
      "Here's how the ChatGPT-powered Target tool will work: Inside the ChatGPT app, consumers can tag Target and ask for ideas, such as if they're planning something like a holiday family movie night. The Target app will then suggest specific products, such as blankets or snacks, and allow users to buy them directly without leaving the ChatGPT interface.",

      "Child care costs for parents with two kids exceed rental costs in 85 of the country's largest metro areas, personal finance site\u00a0LendingTree found. In Omaha, Neb., Milwaukee, Wis., and Buffalo, N.Y., which have the highest child care costs in the country relative to local rents, families with an infant and a 4-year-old under care on average pay more than double the cost of their rent.",
      "Families around the U.S. pay an average of $1,282 for full-time infant care, still below the average monthly cost to rent a two-bedroom unit, LendingTree's data shows. Families with two children, on the other hand, spend an average of $2,252 per month on child care.",
      "LendingTree, which determined how child care costs stack up against rent in 100 cities. compiled its findings using data from nonprofit group Child Care Aware of America and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.",
      "Exorbitant child care costs are contributing to what amounts to a crisis of affordability for many Americans, who also face rising food, housing,\u00a0energy and\u00a0health care costs. A\u00a0survey\u00a0of roughly 3,000 people released this week by Brigham Young University and Deseret News found that 7 in 10 respondents said that raising children is unaffordable, a sentiment that has surged over the last decade.",
      "One parent facing a child care crunch is New York City resident Gina Monroe, who started sending her son to day care in September.",
      "\"Having to have a household with both parents working and a grandmother that was getting too old to take care of a two-year-old, you don't have a choice,\" she told CBS News.",

      "The financial strain of everyday life in the U.S., especially following the fierce inflation that erupted during the pandemic, has emerged as a political flashpoint this year.",
      "For example, the Trump administration has in recent weeks floated several ideas aimed at easing costs for Americans, including proposals for a\u00a0$2,000 tariff rebate check\u00a0and a 50-year mortgage. The administration also last week\u00a0announced tariff exemptions on some popular grocery store staples, including bananas, beef and coffee, as Americans continue to battle elevated food costs.",
      "Incoming New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani also made issues around affordability the centerpiece of his campaign, urging city officials to establish free child care for children ages 6 weeks to 5 years old.",
      "Why are child care costs soaring?",
      "Child care expenses have been rising steadily for years, and show little sign of relenting. From 2020 to 2024, costs rose nearly 30%, data from the nonprofit group Child Care Aware shows.",
      "The main driver for that surge, according to experts: a shortage of early education workers and available places at daycare centers, relative to the enormous demand for such services from families around the U.S.",
      "To that end, Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree, pointed to what he described as \"child care deserts\" in some regions, where parents face a dearth of acceptable options. These are most common in low-income rural areas, which have difficulty recruiting and retaining a qualified workforce, a 2023 government report found.",
      "Where high-quality child care is in short supply, the owners can charge a premium given they face little competition, Schulz noted.",

    "story": [
      "Roblox, the popular online gaming platform that hosts millions of user-created games, said Tuesday it is strengthening protections for minors.",
      "Roblox said it will soon require players to use AI-powered facial age-estimation technology to help verify their age. The system, combined with ID-based age verification and confirmed parental consent, is intended to \"provide a more accurate measure of a user's age than simply relying on what someone types in when they create an account,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Roblox CEO David Baszucki described the guardrails in an interview with CBS Mornings' Tony Dokoupil as \"what we believe will become the gold standard for safety and civility on the internet.\"",
      "Doukopil questioned Baszucki about potential parental concerns about the AI verification, given that it involves minors sending pictures of themselves into the app to verify the user's age. Some parents \"are already skeptical about their children's safety on Roblox,\" Doukopil said.",
      "Roblox is \"not storing these images,\" Baszucki said. The photos \"are deleted soon after [Roblox] process[es] them.\"",
      "The image is used to determine the age of the Roblox user, and \"then to assign them to the right people that might connect with,\" he added.",
      "The company will start enforcing the age-check requirement in select global markets, including Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands, before expanding the system to other countries in early January. Roblox is also launching a dedicated online safety center to help families understand and set up the platform's parental controls.",
      "The company's enhanced protections arrive as dozens of families, along with attorneys general in Kentucky and Louisiana, are suing Roblox, Discord and other technology companies for allegedly failing to deter sexual predators from approaching children on their platforms. Florida is also investigating Roblox, with Attorney General James Uthmeier accusing the platform of failing to protect minors.",
      "Roblox in September outlined plans to expand age checks for all users who want to access communication features on the gaming platform. The guardrails are meant to limit communication between adults and minors unless they already know each other in the real world.",

      "Artificial intelligence has fired the stock market to record highs this year, with companies eager to tout their AI prowess and investor darlings like AI chipmaker Nvidia soaring\u00a0on expectations of runaway growth.",
      "But a tinge of fear is starting to shadow that exuberance. Stocks have slumped this week as investors fret that the AI boom could go bust, with the S&P 500 on Nov. 18 dipping 0.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 1.1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite sinking 1.2%.",
      "The startling run-up in AI-related stocks is prompting comparisons to the dot-com era of the late 1990s, when many internet companies saw their stock prices skyrocket despite suffering vast financial losses. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, it took down former high-fliers like Pets.com, torched investor portfolios and triggered a recession.",
      "Bubbles occur when stocks surge on inflated growth expectations that ultimately prove to be disconnected from a company's underlying fundamentals, a painful reality check that typically ends with overhyped shares falling back to Earth.",
      "Beyond the stock market, economists are also questioning whether AI will turn out to be as transformative for businesses as proponents of the technology insist. Advocates say AI will spur a productivity boom, leading to stronger corporate growth and profitability.",
      "\"The stock market is a giant bet on AI right now. It's really 10 companies that are driving all of it,\" Rebecca Homkes, an economist and lecturer at the London Business School, told CBS News.",

      "\"No one wants to be caught dancing after the music has stopped,\" Aaron Schaechterle, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said in an email.",
      "Still, today's stock valuations aren't nearly as stretched as they were in the late 1990s, Goldman Sachs analysts note. The investment bank's analysis of the Magnificent 7's median price-to-earnings ratio \u2014 a measure of a company's share price compared to its profits \u2014 found it is \"roughly half\" that of the largest seven companies in the late 1990s.",
      "\"So it is true that valuations are high but, in our view, generally not at levels that are as high as are typically seen at the height of a financial bubble,\" they noted.",
      "Why this time may be different",
      "The question of whether AI is fueling a bubble akin to the late 1990s was even posed to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.",
      "\"This is different in the sense that these companies \u2014 the companies that are so highly valued \u2014 actually have earnings and stuff like that,\" Powell said. \"So you go back to the '90s and the dot-com [period]... these were ideas rather than companies.\"",
      "Nvidia, for example, the AI boom's poster child, has seen its revenue more than double to $130 billion in its last fiscal year, while its profit surged 145%.",
      "Although the stock market may not be in imminent danger of a bubble-bursting crash, economists are increasingly questioning whether AI companies can live up to the hype, as well as justify the trillions in capital spending on the data centers and other infrastructure required to power the AI revolution.",
      "For these bets to pay off, AI will need to transform U.S. businesses by spurring a productivity boom that translates into stronger corporate growth and profitability, experts say.",
      "\"We want to understand whether this is storytelling or actual tangible gains,\" Homkes of the London Business School told CBS News.",
      "For tech evangelists like Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, the AI boom will lead to a \"4th industrial revolution\" that could supercharge economic growth. \"This is an AI Arms Race, and what is fueling this next chapter of growth is Big Tech spending and that is NOT slowing down into 2026,\" he wrote this week in a research note.",

    "story": [
      "Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp after a judge ruled that the company does not hold a monopoly in social networking.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued his ruling Tuesday after the historic antitrust trial wrapped up in late May. His decision follows two separate rulings that branded Google an illegal monopoly in both search and online advertising, dealing yet another regulatory blow to the tech industry that for years enjoyed nearly unbridled growth.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission \"continues to insist that Meta competes with the same old rivals it has for the last decade, that the company holds a monopoly among that small set, and that it maintained that monopoly through anticompetitive acquisitions,\" Boasberg wrote in his ruling. \"Whether or not Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, though, the agency must show that it continues to hold such power now. The Court's verdict today determines that the FTC has not done so.\"",
      "Meta Platforms Inc., the FTC had argued, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strategy, \"expressed in 2008: 'It is better to buy than compete.' True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.\"",
      "During his April testimony, Zuckerberg pushed back against the FTC's contention that Facebook bought Instagram to neutralize a threat. In his line of questioning, FTC attorney Daniel Matheson repeatedly brought up emails \u2014 many of them more than a decade old \u2014 written by Zuckerberg and his associates before and after the acquisition of Instagram.",
      "While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time didn't capture the full scope of his interest in the company. But the case was not about the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp more than a decade ago, which the FTC approved at the time, but about whether Meta holds a monopoly now. The FTC, Boasberg wrote in the ruling, could only win if it proved \"current or imminent legal violation.\"",
      "The FTC's complaint said Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and \"neutralize perceived competitive threats,\" just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers.",
      "Meta said Tuesday's decision \"recognizes that Meta faces fierce competition.\"",
      "\"Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth. We look forward to continuing to partner with the Administration and to invest in America,\" the Menlo Park, California-based company said in a statement.",
      "The social media landscape has changed so much since the FTC filed its lawsuit in 2020, Boasberg wrote, that each time the court examined Meta's apps and competition, they changed. Two opinions to dismiss the case \u2014 filed in 2021 and 2022 \u2014 didn't even mention popular social video platform TikTok. Today, it \"holds center stage as Meta's fiercest rival.\"",
      "Quoting the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, \"that no man can ever step into the same river twice,\" Boasberg said the same is true for the online world of social media as well.",
      "\"The landscape that existed only five years ago when the Federal Trade Commission brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly. While it once might have made sense to partition apps into separate markets of social networking and social media, that wall has since broken down,\" he wrote.",
      "Emarketer analyst Minda Smiley said Meta's win \"is not necessarily surprising considering the lengths it's gone to in recent years to keep up with TikTok.\"",
      "\"But from a regulatory standpoint, Meta is far from out of the woods: next year, major social networks will face landmark trials in the US regarding children's mental health,\" she added. \"Still, today's win is surely a boost for the company as it battles criticism and questions over how its massive AI spending will ultimately benefit Meta in the long run.\"",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following \u2014 in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal's value fell to $750 million after Facebook's stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012.",
      "Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller \"acqui-hires\" \u2014 a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",
      "WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp.",

      "Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland shows that 39,006 Americans last month in 21 states received a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, or WARN, notice informing them of an upcoming layoff. U.S. labor law requires employers to provide these written warnings 60 days ahead of plant closings or mass layoffs.",

      "Despite the lack of official government data, some other measures point to a cooling U.S. labor market. For example, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas recently said that layoffs last month\u00a0soared to their highest October level in 22 years, while\u00a0ADP data\u00a0released Tuesday shows U.S. companies shed an average of 2,500 jobs per week in the four weeks ending Nov. 1.",

      "The S&P 500, which set a record high in late October, fell 78 points, or 1.2%, to 6,594 roughly an hour into Tuesday's session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.2% and 1.6%, respectively.",
      "The S&P 500 remains up more than 12% this year, the Dow has added 8% and the Nasdaq has risen more than 15%.",
      "AI pioneer Nvidia was again the heaviest weight on the market. The chipmaker's drop of 3.2% brought its loss for the month to nearly 11%, putting it in \"correction\" territory, or when a stock falls at least 10% from its previous high. The company is scheduled to report is third-quarter financial results on Wednesday.",
      "\"Stocks are extending their losses so far on [Tuesday] as sentiment stays downbeat and investors continue to dial back on tech exposure,\" market analyst Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge said in a research note.",
      "What Nvidia does matters disproportionately to investors because it's the most influential stock on Wall Street. It can almost single-handedly steer the direction of the S&P 500 on some days because of its immense size, after fervent demand for its AI chips helped it briefly top $5 trillion in total value. The S&P 500 sits at the heart of many investors' 401(k) accounts.",
      "\"The boost AI has given to the U.S. stock market since the launch of ChatGPT has been so strong that the S&P 500 would currently be closer to 5,000 without it,\" John Higgins, chief markets economist with Capital Economics, said in a note to investors. \"It's therefore hardly surprising that investors are preoccupied with whether the gains racked up by titans in the sectors at the heart of this transformative technology can be sustained.\"",
      "Nvidia's and the U.S. stock market's struggles are a sharp turnaround from months of relentless rallying since April, when Wall Street sold off after President Donald Trump shocked the world with stiff tariffs.",
      "That rally, though, was so strong that critics said it may have carried stock prices too high, too fast and left the market at risk of a sharp drop. They pointed in particular to stocks swept up in the mania around AI.",
      "Despite Wall Street's recent stumble, many big investors expect stocks to recover, according to the latest monthly survey of global fund managers by Bank of America Global Research. But when asked what the No. 1 risk for the market is, one with a lower probability of happening but a high chance of damage, 45% pointed to an AI bubble. That beat out trouble in the bond market, inflation and trade wars.",
      "The highest net percentage of investors in 20 years is also saying companies are \"overinvesting,\" according to the survey. The worry is that all the investment pouring into AI chips and data centers worldwide may not produce the kind of revolution that proponents have been predicting, or at least not as profitable a one.",
      "Other high-flying areas of the market with their own evangelists have also been struggling lately. Bitcoin's price briefly fell below $90,000 during the morning, down from nearly $125,000 last month.",

      "If a Taiwan emergency entails \"battleships and the use of force, then that could constitute a situation threatening the survival (of Japan),\" she told parliament on Nov. 7. Under Japan's self-imposed domestic rules, an existential threat is one of the few cases where it can act militarily. Taiwan sits around 60 miles from the nearest Japanese island.",
      "In response to Takaichi's remarks, a Chinese diplomat stationed in Japan threatened to \"cut off that dirty neck,\" apparently referring to Takaichi, as China and Japan summoned each other's ambassadors.",

Japan sent a senior diplomat to Beijing for talks on Tuesday, but there was no announcement of any significant progress to ease the bilateral standoff.",
      "During the daily briefing on Tuesday at China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a spokesman demanded that Japan \"immediately retract its erroneous remarks, engage in profound self-reflection, change course, and provide the Chinese people with a clear explanation\" of Takaichi's comments.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/social-security-retirement-age-2026-change-66-67-increase/",
    "published": "Mon, 17 Nov 2025 16:27:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Social Security's full retirement age is changing next year, affecting when the youngest baby boomers and Gen Xers can collect 100% of their benefits.",
    "story": [
      "Social Security's so-called \"full retirement age\" \u2014 the age when people can start collecting all of their earned benefits \u2014 is about to hit a new threshold, a change that will affect Americans born in 1960 or later.",
      "The full retirement age (FRA) for Social Security is calculated using a worker's birth year, while their monthly benefits are based on the number of years they've worked and their income over that period. People may claim Social Security as early as age 62, but doing so permanently reduces their monthly benefit by about 30% compared with waiting until hitting their FRA.",
      "Starting in 2026, Social Security's full retirement age is set to make its final scheduled increase, marking the last step-up in age enacted under a\u00a01983 congressional reform\u00a0designed to shore up the program's finances. Before that overhaul, people could claim their FRA benefits at 65, but the law gradually pushed that age higher, culminating in the change that takes effect in 2026.",
      "Since 2021, the FRA has been rising by two months each year. It now stands at 66 years and 10 months for people born in 1959. Next year brings the final step in that schedule, when the FRA will reach 67 for everyone born in 1960 or later.",
      "With the FRA hitting 67, people born in 1960 won't qualify for their full benefits until 2027, rather than 2026. (You can check your own full-benefit age by entering your birthdate into this Social Security calculator.)",
      "The increase in the FRA will first impact the youngest baby boomers, or those born between 1960-1964, followed by Generation X, which spans 1965 to 1980. The change comes as many workers report feeling financially unprepared for retirement, with only about four in 10 Americans saying they're on track to maintain their current lifestyle in retirement,\u00a0according\u00a0to recent research from Vanguard.",
      "\"Raising the retirement age is an effective cut in lifetime benefits for younger baby boomers, members of Gen X and all the generations after,\" said Max Richtman, CEO of the advocacy group National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, in an email to CBS News.",
      "While the increase in the full retirement age shouldn't come as a surprise given it was enacted 43 years ago, it doesn't guarantee older workers will be any more prepared financially for retirement, he added.",
      "\"Having time to plan, however, does not mean they have been able to put aside more for retirement, considering the stagnation of real wages and the rising cost of college tuition, home prices and other key living expenses,\" Richtman said.",
      "Retirement expectations versus reality",
      "There's also a longstanding gap between the age at which people expect to stop working and their real-world experiences, which can add to the financial strain of funding retirement. Many Americans believe they'll retire at age 65, but the median retirement age in the U.S. is in fact 62.",
      "Nearly six in 10 retirees say they stepped back from the workforce earlier than they had planned, according to research published last year by the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies. An October survey from the same group found that most middle-class retirees \u2014 people with annual household incomes between $50,000 and $199,999 \u2014 stopped working earlier than they envisioned because of employment issues, such as losing their jobs, or poor health.",
      "That gap between expectations and reality may explain recent research that found 44% of Americans said they plan to claim Social Security before they\u00a0reach their full retirement age, which would result in lower monthly benefits.",
      "Some Americans also flle for Social Security before reaching their FRA out of a belief it makes more sense to bank more years of guaranteed retirement income, even if it's at a lower monthly amount.",
      "Transamerica also found that nine in 10 working Americans say they plan to ignore the conventional financial advice of\u00a0waiting until age 70 to claim Social Security benefits, which locks in a 24% boost to a retiree's FRA payments.",
      "In the meantime, younger boomers and Gen Xers will have to hold off a little longer to claim their full Social Security benefits.",
      "\"These younger cohorts will have to try their best to plan for retirement, knowing that they cannot collect full benefits until 67,\" Richtman added.",

    "story": [
      "Hours after federal judges blocked Texas from using its newly drawn congressional map, state leaders filed an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "The redrawn map sparked a nationwide redistricting battle and is part of President Trump's efforts to preserve a Republican majority in the House of Representatives in next year's midterm elections.",
      "The Tuesday ruling came in a 2-1 vote by a three-judge panel. It dealt a blow to Republicans while Democrats celebrated it.",
      "That's because under the newly drawn map approved by Republicans, who stood to gain five congressional seats in Texas, the Democrats were facing a game of political musical chairs -- some were set to retire or primary each other. Now, that may not have to happen.",
      "\"Substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 map,\" which is illegal, the two federal judges who voted to block the map said in the ruling.",
      "They also cited a U.S. Department of Justice letter to Gov. Greg Abbott from July about four coalition districts made up of Blacks and Latinos that include the 33rd Congressional District in North Texas, represented by Democrat Marc Veasey.",
      "\"DOJ threatened legal action if Texas didn't immediately dismantle and redraw these districts, a threat based on their racial makeup. Notably, the DOJ letter targeted only majority non-white districts,\" the judges' ruling said. \"Any mention of majority white districts, which DOJ presumably would have also targeted if its aims were partisan rather than racial, was conspicuously absent.\"",
      "There was no initial word on what the third judge on the panel said in dissenting.",
      "Abbott slams judge's \"erroneous\" decision",
      "In a statement Tuesday, Abbott slammed the judges' decision, calling it \"clearly erroneous\" and saying it \"undermines the authority the U.S. Constitution assigns to the Texas Legislature by imposing a different map by judicial edict. The State of Texas will swiftly appeal to the United States Supreme Court.\"",
      "The state filed its appeal to the highest court late Tuesday afternoon.",
      "CBS News Texas spoke with Democratic members of Congress from North Texas who praised the ruling.",
      "\"I totally agree with the court,\" said Rep. Julie Johnson, D-Farmers Branch. \"You know, what the Republicans and Greg Abbott did in Texas, to seeking to disenfranchise voters of color was egregious, and the court clearly agreed with that. This opinion is sharp, and it is clear, and it is concise.\"",
      "Veasey, whose district covers Fort Worth, said, \"I feel like we're on good legal grounds here. So, I feel confident, but, you know, I'm going to be again cautiously optimistic in watching what the Supreme Court says.\"",
      "\"I've always made it clear that this was racial, and I know that some people want to run away from the race element, but the law protects it. We know that our Constitution recognizes and protects it,\" said Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Dallas.",
      "Texas Republicans criticize judges' decision",
      "CBS News Texas also spoke with Republicans Tuesday night who called the judges' decision wrong and said they are putting their faith in the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Aaron Reitz, a GOP candidate for Texas attorney general, said, \"My view is similar to Gov. Abbott's and Attorney General Paxton, who have criticized the decision because, in fact, race was not used to draw these lines. Only politics was used, which is the appropriate standard.\"",
      "Another candidate for attorney general, State Senator Mayes Middleton, R-Galveston, said it was a partisan map.",
      "\"Quite simply, this is a partisan map that draws more Republican seats and that's why we're going to win,\" said Middleton. \"That is why we're going to be victorious in this appeal before the Supreme Court.\"",
      "As a result of the ruling, Rep. Johnson and Rep. Veasey said they will run for re-election in the districts they represent now.",
      "Crockett she said she still hasn't decided whether to run for re-election in her district in Dallas or if she is going to run statewide for U.S. Senate. She said she is waiting for polling to come back and that she hopes to make a decision by Thanksgiving.",
      "The key, Crockett said, is if the polling shows she can beat a Republican candidate in the general election next November.",
      "\"At the end of the day, if the numbers are strong that I am our best shot, then it's bigger than my district, it's bigger than the state of Texas,\" said Crockett. \"This is about the country because we know if we can change the Senate map in this country, then that's where we start to get wins.\"",
      "Crockett said the only way she or another Democrat can win is if they attract new voters, people who haven't gone to the polls before, and not simply by attracting Republicans who cross the political aisle.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-website-change-vaccines-autism/",
    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 20:32:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Multiple CDC officials familiar with the situation said the change was made by political appointees without input from relevant agency staffers.",
    "story": [
      "A page of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website was changed to include a false claim about autism and vaccines. Multiple CDC officials familiar with the situation said the change was made by political appointees inside the Department of Health and Human Services without input from relevant agency staffers.",
      "The page about vaccines and autism formerly said that \"no links have been found between any vaccine ingredients and Autism spectrum disorder.\" The website has now been changed to say, \"'Vaccines do not cause autism' is not an evidence-based claim\" \u2014 a statement the Autism Science Foundation calls \"misinformation\" that \"actually contradicts the best available science.\" The CDC page also falsely claims that studies supporting a link between vaccines and autism have \"been ignored by health authorities.\"",
      "Previously, changes have only occurred in consultation with subject matter experts at the agency's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities and its National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. The CDC sources told CBS News political appointees at HHS devised the change and instructed an employee inside the office of acting CDC Director Jim O'Neil to make it.",
      "Autism is a developmental disability caused by differences in the brain. It presents with a wide range of symptoms that can include delays in language, learning, and social or emotional skills. The National Institutes of Health has committed hundreds of millions of dollars a year to studying the condition and trying to understand how and why it develops.",
      "The debunked theory that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine causes autism has its roots in a 1998 study that was\u00a0found to be fraudulent\u00a0and has been retracted. Since then, \"independent researchers across seven countries have conducted more than 40 high-quality studies involving over 5.6 million people,\" said American Academy of Pediatrics president Susan Kressly in a statement decrying the website change.",
      "\"We are at a very dangerous moment for the health of America's children,\" said Dr. Sean O'Leary, chair of the AAP's Committee on Infectious Diseases, in a news briefing on Thursday.",
      "Research has found no evidence of increased rates of autism among those who are vaccinated compared to those who are not. Vaccines also undergo intensive safety testing. Research shows that genetics play a role in autism diagnoses. The NIH says some possible risk factors for autism include prenatal exposure to pesticides or air pollution, extreme prematurity or low birth weight, certain maternal health conditions, or parents conceiving at an older age.",
      "\"There is overwhelming evidence that vaccines do not cause autism,\" said Dr. Mandy Cohen, a former CDC director. \"This change to CDC language undermines the agency's scientific integrity, damaging its credibility on vaccines and other health recommendations. Most concerning, it risks endangering children by driving down vaccination rates and leaving kids vulnerable to preventable diseases like measles and whooping cough.\"",
      "In a statement, HHS communications director Andrew Nixon said, \"This is a common-sense update that brings CDC's website in line with our commitment to transparency and gold standard science.",
      "\"As the updated page explains, the claim that 'vaccines do not cause autism' is not supported by comprehensive evidence, as studies to date have not definitively ruled out potential associations. Some research suggesting possible biologic mechanisms has been ignored or dismissed by public health agencies, and HHS is committed to finding a definitive answer,\" Nixon said.",
      "Leading autism advocacy groups dispute that.",
      "The Autism Science Foundation\u00a0said in a statement\u00a0it was \"appalled\" by the change to the CDC's website, and highlighted the decades of research into the topic. Alison Singer, the co-founder and president of the ASF, said that while researchers \"can't do a scientific study to show that something does not cause something else,\" there are a \"mountain of studies that we have exonerating vaccines as a cause of autism.\"",
      "\"I think the question of whether vaccines causes autism is one that science can answer, and science has answered it,\" Singer said in Thursday's news briefing.",
      "A subhead saying that \"Vaccines do not cause autism\" remains on the CDC website with an asterisk next to it. The bottom of the page explains that the header remains in place because of an agreement with Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, a physician who is the chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and backed HHS\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u00a0during his confirmation hearings. Cassidy said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that he supported Kennedy in part because of \"serious commitments\" from the Trump administration, but did not specify what those were.",
      "\"I'm a doctor who has seen people die from vaccine-preventable diseases,\" Cassidy wrote on social media on Thursday afternoon. \"What parents need to hear right now is vaccines for measles, polio, hepatitis B and other childhood diseases are safe and effective and will not cause autism. Any statement to the contrary is wrong, irresponsible, and actively makes Americans sicker.\"",
      "Cassidy highlighted recent outbreaks of whooping cough and measles. He also called for more research into \"the real causes of autism,\" and criticized\u00a0HHS funding\u00a0cuts.",
      "\"Redirecting attention to factors we definitely know DO NOT cause autism denies families the answers they deserve,\" Cassidy wrote.",
      "Other health agency pages with information about autism and vaccines had not been changed as of early Thursday afternoon.",
      "Kennedy has previously pushed the\u00a0discredited claim\u00a0that routine\u00a0childhood shots\u00a0cause autism. President Trump has also falsely suggested vaccines could be to blame for autism rates. Both expressed concern about rising rates of\u00a0autism diagnoses, which appear to be driven by a variety of factors including\u00a0increased awareness\u00a0and changes in how the condition is diagnosed.",
      "O'Leary said he feared the website changes would \"scare parents and further stigmatize\" people with autism.",
      "\"We have been dealing with these falsehoods for many years. They are not new. We have been promoting the science, and we're going to continue to do that, as are the other professional societies,\" he said. \"The problem is now it's coming from, these falsehoods are coming for our federal government.\"",
      "Experts have previously raised concerns about Kennedy reviving debunked theories about the cause of autism. In April, Kennedy announced the CDC would conduct a \"massive testing and research effort\" to find out what causes the disorder, and hired David Geier, a man who repeatedly claimed a link between vaccines and autism, to lead the effort. Kennedy said the work would be completed by September, though other health officials later pushed the timeline.",
      "Dr. Fiona Havers, an infectious disease physician and former CDC official, said that the website change showed scientists \"who in the past carefully vetted scientific information have been pushed aside.\"",
      "The \"CDC should be a data-driven agency based on science and not ideology, but when you take the scientists out of the process you get rhetoric that can harm families,\" said former CDC chief science and medical officer Dr. Debra Houry, who lresigned from the agency earlier this year.",

      "The president said in a later post, \"SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!\" He also reposted \"HANG THEM, GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD!\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, speaking from the Senate floor Thursday morning, said \"the president of the United States is calling for the execution of elected officials.\" Schumer called it an \"outright threat\" that is \"deadly serious.\"",
      "\"Every time Donald Trump posts things like this, he makes political violence more likely. None of us should tolerate this kind of behavior,\" said Schumer, a New York Democrat. \"He is lighting a match in a country soaked with political gasoline.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's posts came in response to a video featuring Sens. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, along with Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania and Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire. In the video, the lawmakers, who are veterans and former national security officials, cited threats to the Constitution while urging service members and members of the intelligence community to \"refuse illegal orders.\"",
      "The lawmakers in the video issued a statement on Thursday saying \"what's most telling is that the President considers it punishable by death for us to restate the law.\"",
      "\"But this isn't about any one of us,\" the statement said. \"This isn't about politics. This is about who we are as Americans. Every American must unite and condemn the President's calls for our murder and political violence. This is a time for moral clarity.\"",
      "Slotkin posted a\u00a0video response, saying, \"I would hope that people of all backgrounds \u2014 Democrat, Republican, Independent \u2014 would agree that threatening death for people you disagree with is beyond the pale of who we are as Americans.\"",
      "\"I refuse to be intimidated out of defending the country I love,\" she said.",
      "Houlahan said\u00a0in an interview, \"This is the president of the United States calling for the death of a member of Congress, six members of Congress, and that is a different brand of political violence and political retribution.\"",
      "Schumer told reporters at the Capitol that he asked for special Capitol Police protection for Senators Slotkin and Kelly.",
      "He said \"every American, regardless of party,\" should condemn the president's words \"immediately and without qualification,\" adding, \"if we don't draw a line here, there is no line left to draw.\"",
      "\"He must be condemned forcefully, loudly and without excuses, before someone takes his words as permission to do the unthinkable,\" Schumer said. \"Anything less enables the flames of hatred to grow and spread.\"",
      "Democratic leaders in the House likewise condemned what they called the \"disgusting and dangerous death threats against Members of Congress,\" calling on Republicans to do the same. The Democrats said they have been in contact with the House Sergeant at Arms and the United States Capitol Police to \"ensure the safety of these Members and their families.\"",
      "\"Donald Trump must immediately delete these unhinged social media posts and recant his violent rhetoric before he gets someone killed,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Democratic Whip Katherine Clark and Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar said in a joint statement.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson initially declined to criticize the president's remarks, telling reporters it's \"wildly inappropriate\" for lawmakers to encourage members of the military to disobey orders.",
      "\"We have got to raise the bar in Congress, this is out of control,\" said Johnson, a Louisiana Republican.",

    "story": [
      "Grammy-winning rapper Prakazrel \"Pras\" Michel of the Fugees was sentenced on Thursday to 14 years in prison for a case in which he was convicted of illegally funneling millions of dollars in foreign contributions to former President Barack Obama's 2012 reelection campaign.",
      "Michel, 52, declined to address the court before U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly sentenced him.",
      "In April 2023, a federal jury convicted Michel of 10 counts, including conspiracy and acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government. The trial in Washington, D.C., included testimony from actor Leonardo DiCaprio and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.",
      "Justice Department prosecutors said federal sentencing guidelines recommended a life sentence for Michel, whom they said \"betrayed his country for money\" and \"lied unapologetically and unrelentingly to carry out his schemes.\"",
      "\"His sentence should reflect the breadth and depth of his crimes, his indifference to the risks to his country, and the magnitude of his greed,\" they wrote.",
      "Defense attorney Peter Zeidenberg said his client's 14-year sentence is \"completely disproportionate to the offense.\" Michel will appeal his conviction and sentence, according to his lawyer.",
      "Zeidenberg had recommended a three-year prison sentence. A life sentence would be an \"absurdly high\" punishment for Michel, given that it is typically reserved for deadly terrorists and drug cartel leaders, Michel's attorneys said in a court filing.",
      "\"The Government's position is one that would cause Inspector Javert to recoil and, if anything, simply illustrates just how easily the Guidelines can be manipulated to produce absurd results, and how poorly equipped they are, at least on this occasion, to determine a fair and just sentence,\" they wrote.",
      "Michel, a Brooklyn native whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from Haiti, was a founding member of the Fugees along with childhood friends Lauryn Hill and Wyclef Jean. Their hip-hop band won two Grammy Awards and sold tens of millions of albums.",
      "Michel obtained more than $120 million from Malaysian billionaire Low Taek Jho \u2014 also known as Jho Low \u2014 and steered some of that money through straw donors to Obama's campaign.",
      "Michel said during trial that he viewed Low's payments as \"free money,\" and accepted the millions over the course of nine months to help Low secure a photo op with Obama. He said under oath at the time that no one told him such payments toward political donations could have been unlawful or violations of campaign finance laws.",
      "The Justice Department also charged Michel with serving as an unregistered foreign agent for China, alleging that in 2017 he sought to sway the Trump administration to halt its probe into Low and to extradite a Chinese government target living in the U.S. That individual, dissident Miles Guo, was charged in New York in a billion-dollar fraud case and is still in custody.",
      "Low, who has lived in China, was one of the primary financiers of \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" a movie starring DiCaprio. Low is a fugitive but has maintained his innocence.",
      "\"Low's motivation for giving Mr. Michel money to donate was not so that he could achieve some policy objective. Instead, Low simply wanted to obtain a photograph with himself and then-President Obama,\" Michel's attorneys wrote.",
      "In August 2024, the judge rejected Michel's request for a new trial based in part on his defense attorney's use of a generative artificial intelligence program during his closing of the trial's arguments. The judges said that and other trial errors didn't amount to a serious miscarriage of justice.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration is proposing new oil drilling off the California and Florida coasts for the first time in decades, as President Trump seeks to expand U.S. oil production.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration announced new oil drilling off the California and Florida coasts for the first time in decades on Thursday, as President Trump seeks to expand U.S. oil production, advancing a project that critics say could harm coastal communities and ecosystems.",
      "The oil industry has been seeking access to new offshore areas, including off Southern California and Florida, as a way to boost U.S. energy security and jobs. The federal government has not allowed drilling in federal waters in the eastern Gulf, which includes offshore Florida and part of offshore Alabama, since 1995, because of concerns about oil spills. California has some offshore oil rigs, but there has been no new leasing in federal waters since the mid-1980s.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who is eyeing a 2028 presidential run and has emerged as a leading Trump critic, called the plan \"idiotic\" and \"reckless\" in a statement. The proposal is also likely to draw bipartisan opposition in Florida. Tourism and access to clean beaches are key parts of the economy in both states.",
      "The administration's plan proposes six offshore lease sales off the coast of California.",
      "It also calls for new drilling off the coast of Florida in areas at least 100 miles from that state's shore. The area targeted for leasing is adjacent to an area in the Central Gulf that already contains thousands of wells and hundreds of drilling platforms.",
      "The five-year plan also would compel more than 20 lease sales off the coast of Alaska, including a newly designated area known as the High Arctic, more than 200 miles offshore in the Arctic Ocean.",
      "CBS News reported earlier this month that the Trump administration was planning to hold offshore drilling auctions in several areas, including off the coasts of California, New England and the Carolinas. Plans viewed by CBS News called for lease sales off California as soon as 2027, and off Alaska as soon as next year.",
      "The energy industry has encouraged the Trump administration to expand offshore drilling. All offshore areas \"with the potential to generate jobs, new revenue and additional production to advance America's energy dominance should be considered for inclusion,\" the American Petroleum Institute and other groups said in a joint letter to the administration in June.",
      "Some Florida politicians have pushed back on offshore drilling plans. Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican and Trump ally, helped persuade Trump administration officials to drop a similar offshore plan in 2018 when he was governor. Earlier this month, Scott and fellow Florida Republican Sen. Ashley Moody co-sponsored a bill to maintain a moratorium on offshore drilling in the state, which Mr. Trump signed in his first term.",
      "\"As Floridians, we know how vital our beautiful beaches and coastal waters are to our state's economy, environment and way of life,\" Scott said in a Nov. 3\u00a0statement\u00a0announcing the bill. \"I will always work to keep Florida's shores pristine and protect our natural treasures for generations to come.\"",
      "Newsom said in a statement Thursday: \"Trump's idiotic plan endangers our coastal economy and communities and hurts the well-being of Californians. This reckless attempt to sell out our coastline to his Big Oil donors is dead in the water.\"",
      "California has been a leader in restricting offshore oil drilling since the infamous 1969 Santa Barbara spill that helped spark the modern environmental movement. While there have been no new federal leases offered since the mid-1980s, drilling from existing platforms continues.",
      "Newsom expressed support for greater offshore controls after a 2021 spill off Huntington Beach and has backed a congressional effort to ban new offshore drilling on the West Coast.",
      "\"For decades, California has stood firm in our opposition to new offshore drilling, and nothing will change that,\" the governor said in his statement Thursday.",
      "A Texas-based company, with support from the Trump administration, is seeking to restart production in waters off Santa Barbara, California, damaged by a 2015 oil spill. The administration has hailed the plan by Houston-based Sable Offshore Corp. as the kind of project Mr. Trump wants to increase U.S. energy production as the federal government removes regulatory barriers.",
      "Since taking office for a second time in January, Mr. Trump has reversed former President Joe Biden's focus on climate change to pursue what he calls U.S. \"energy dominance\" in the global market. The president created a National Energy Dominance Council and directed it to move quickly to drive up already record-high U.S. energy production, particularly fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas.",
      "Mr. Trump signed an executive order on the first day of his second term reversing Biden's ban on future offshore oil drilling on the East and West coasts. A federal court later struck down Biden's order to withdraw 625 million acres of federal waters from oil development.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump's administration has blocked renewable energy sources such as offshore wind and canceled billions of dollars in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects across the country.",
      "Democratic lawmakers, including California Sens. Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff and Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, warned that opening vast coastlines to new offshore drilling \"would devastate coastal economies, jeopardize our national security, ravage coastal ecosystems, and put millions of Americans' health and safety at risk.''",
      "Oil spills \"not only cause irreparable environmental damage, but also suppress the value of coastal homes, harm tourism economies and weaken coastal infrastructure,'' the lawmakers said in a letter signed by dozens of Democrats. One disastrous oil spill can cost taxpayers billions in lost revenue, cleanup costs and ecosystem restoration, they said.",
      "The League of Conservation Voters called Thursday's plan \"dangerous.\"",
      "\"This needless, reckless expansion of offshore drilling would jeopardize our coastal communities, public health, local economies, and the environment, while prolonging our dependence on fossil fuels and doing nothing to lower costs,\" America Fitzpatrick, the group's conservation program director, said in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has received a draft plan aimed at ending the war in Ukraine, his office confirmed Thursday.",
      "It said in a statement that he had \"officially received a draft plan from the American side, which, according to the American side, could activate diplomacy.\" The statement went on to say \"it was agreed to work on the points of the plan in such a way as to bring the war to a dignified end.\"",
      "A senior White House official confirmed to CBS News on Thursday that President Trump was backing a 28-point plan drafted by envoy Steve Witkoff and an adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war Russia started nearly four years ago with its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but it's not clear whether this plan is the one that Zelenskyy received.",
      "The plan, according to reports by Axios, the Financial Times and the New York Times, calls for Ukraine to abandon territory, give up some weapons and shrink its army, and while President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday that the war must end, he reiterated that from Kyiv's perspective, \"there can be no reward for waging war.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's endorsement of the plan was first reported by NBC.",
      "Previously, Ukraine has agreed with the U.S. to a freezing of the battle lines where they stand as a starting point for negotiations, while also making clear that it needs security guarantees from Washington and its Western partners.",
      "Axios, citing a U.S. official, reported Monday that Witkoff was drafting a 28-point peace plan and had \"discussed it extensively\" with Kirill Dmitriev, an adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Dmitriev said in an interview with Axios that he met with Witkoff and other Trump officials for three days in Miami in late October. He expressed optimism about the proposal, saying, \"We feel the Russian position is really being heard.\"",
      "Just days after the Trump administration imposed sanctions on Russian oil and gas in October, Dmitriev traveled to the U.S. to hold previously scheduled talks with Witkoff in an effort to continue to make progress on a proposal to end the war, as a senior U.S. official described it at the time.",
      "Dmitriev is under U.S. sanctions, which had to be waived for him to travel to Florida to meet with Witkoff.",
      "The White House official who spoke with CBS News on Thursday said Witkoff had been working on a proposal quietly for about a month, and said that he consulted with both the Russians and Ukrainians to take their feedback into account. The extent of those consultations with Ukraine was not clear from Kyiv's statement Thursday, but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters the same day that Witkoff and Rubio \"met with some of the Ukrainians just in the past week to discuss this very plan.\"",
      "Senior Ukrainian official Rustem Umerov was verbally briefed in Miami this week by Witkoff, a source familiar with the conversation told CBS News.",
      "Top European Union official Kaja Kallas, when asked Thursday if Europeans were involved in the process, responded, \"Not that I know of.\" She also reiterated a point that's consistently been made by Ukraine and its supporters that \"for any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans on board.\"",
      "Witkoff and Dmitriev have been talking for weeks about a proposal to end the war, gaming out ideas even as Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury chief Scott Bessent criticized Russia, saying Moscow was not serious about ending the war.",
      "\"Ending a complex and deadly war such as the one in Ukraine requires an extensive exchange of serious and realistic ideas,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on X Wednesday. \"And achieving a durable peace will require both sides to agree to difficult but necessary concessions. That is why we are and will continue to develop a list of potential ideas for ending this war based on input from both sides of this conflict.\"",
      "White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller told CBS News Wednesday that he didn't have any announcements to share about a peace plan, but said it was an issue \"the president has continued to put at the forefront of our foreign policy goal.\"",
      "The recent U.S. sanctions appear to be taking a toll on Russia \u2014 a Treasury Department analysis Thursday indicates that the oil sanctions have sent prices there tumbling, choking off a key revenue source that Russia has used to fund its war in Ukraine. The U.S. gas sanctions against Russia go into effect Friday.",

      "Democratic Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick of Florida was indicted in federal court Wednesday for allegedly stealing millions of dollars in federal emergency funds and routing some of it to her campaign account.",
      "The Justice Department alleges that in 2021, a year before Cherfilus-McCormick was elected to Congress, a company that she ran\u00a0called Trinity Healthcare Services was overpaid $5 million on a Federal Emergency Management Agency-funded contract to assist with Florida's coronavirus vaccination campaign.",
      "The defendants in the case then allegedly \"conspired to steal\" the money by sending it through multiple bank accounts, the department said in a press release.",
      "Some of that overpaid money was used to help fund Cherfilus-McCormick's campaign to represent South Florida in the House, the Justice Department alleged. In particular, she was accused of funneling some of the money to friends and family members who donated it to her campaign in their own names, in what's known as a \"straw donor\" scheme.",
      "\"Using disaster relief funds for self-enrichment is a particularly selfish, cynical crime,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. \"No one is above the law, least of all powerful people who rob taxpayers for personal gain. We will follow the facts in this case and deliver justice.\"",
      "Cherfilus-McCormick was charged with theft of government funds, money laundering, making and receiving straw donor contributions and three conspiracy counts.",
      "She was also charged with conspiracy to make a false and fraudulent statement on a tax return. The indictment accuses her of submitting a return to the Internal Revenue Service that reported millions in false business expenses and charitable contributions.",
      "The congresswoman's brother, Edwin Cherfilus \u2014 who worked with her at the health care company \u2014 was also charged with money laundering and theft of government funds. Her congressional office's former chief of staff, Nadege Leblanc, was charged with straw donations, and her accountant, David Spencer, was charged with tax offenses.",
      "Cherfilus-McCormick has strongly denied the charges against her, calling them \"intimidation tactics\" in remarks to reporters Thursday afternoon.",
      "\"This is an unjust, baseless, sham indictment \u2014 and I am innocent,\" Cherfilus-McCormick said in a statement provided to CBS News early Thursday morning. \"The timing alone is curious and clearly meant to distract from far more pressing national issues. From day one, I have cooperated with every lawful request, and I will continue to do so until this matter is resolved. I am deeply grateful for the support of my district, and I remain confident that the truth will prevail. I look forward to my day in court. Until then, I will continue fighting for my constituents.\"",
      "Cherfilus-McCormick's legal team said in a statement the congresswoman \"is a committed public servant, who is dedicated to her constituents. We will fight to clear her good name.\"",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters late Wednesday that he would issue a statement on the criminal charges after speaking with Cherfilus-McCormick, but added: \"She's innocent until proven guilty.\"",
      "The congresswoman's company, Trinity Healthcare Services, was also sued by emergency officials in Florida earlier this year over an alleged multimillion-dollar overpayment.",
      "The Florida Department of Emergency Management said it contracted with Trinity to sign people up for COVID-19 vaccines. At one point, the company was accidentally paid more than $5 million rather than $50,000 due to a \"clerical error,\" and the company \"knowingly\" processed the invoice and refused to give the money back, the lawsuit says.",
      "In response, Trinity said in court papers that the state waited three years to inform the company about the overpayments. The company said it told the Florida Department of Emergency Management it was willing to discuss the dispute, but the agency didn't respond.",
      "The state dropped the case last year following mediation between the two parties.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 18:12:15 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal judge ruled Thursday that President Trump's months-long deployment of thousands of National Guard forces to the streets of Washington, D.C., violates federal law.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge ruled Thursday that President Trump's months-long deployment of thousands of National Guard forces to the streets of Washington, D.C., violates federal law.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb sided with D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, who sued the federal government over the Guard deployment, arguing it exceeded the president's legal authority. But the judge stayed her ruling for 21 days to give the Trump administration a chance to appeal it.",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson blasted the ruling, arguing that Mr. Trump has the authority to deploy Guard troops in the nation's capital. Jackson called Schwalb's lawsuit \"nothing more than another attempt \u2014 at the detriment of DC residents \u2014 to undermine the President's highly successful operations to stop violent crime in DC.\"",
      "In his own statement following the ruling, Schwalb said, \"Normalizing the use of military troops for domestic law enforcement sets a dangerous precedent, where the President can disregard states' independence and deploy troops wherever and whenever he wants \u2013 with no check on his military power. This unprecedented federal overreach is not normal, or legal. It is long past time to let the National Guard go home \u2013 to their everyday lives, their regular jobs, their families, and their children.\"",
      "Mr. Trump first ordered National Guard forces to D.C. in August, part of a broader crackdown on crime using a combination of Guard troops, federal law enforcement agents and local D.C. police who were briefly taken over by the federal government.",
      "Since then, Guard forces have been a common sight on the streets of the capital, especially in tourist-heavy areas, drawing pushback from some local officials. The deployment has been extended multiple times, and is currently set to run until at least February 2026.",
      "The president deployed the D.C. National Guard using his authority as commander in chief of the district's Guard forces \u2014 a unique arrangement as state-level Guard forces are usually controlled by governors. Several GOP-led states have also sent their own Guard troops to the city.",
      "In Thursday's ruling, Cobb said the president lacked the power to deploy the D.C. Guard for \"non-military, crime-deterrence missions in the absence of a request from the city's civil authorities.\" She said that, even though the president is the force's commander in chief, he doesn't have unlimited power to deploy the Guard as he sees fit.",
      "The federal government has argued the deployment is justified by a clause in D.C. local law that says the Guard's commanding general \"may order out any portion of the National Guard for such drills, inspections, parades, escort, or other duties\" \u2014 with the current deployment falling under the category of \"other duties.\" Cobb disputed that interpretation, writing that \"other duties\" appears to only cover military exercises.",
      "The Trump administration has also pointed to a local law that says the Guard can \"aid the civil authorities in the execution of the laws.\" But Cobb said that doesn't allow the government to \"unilaterally call upon the DCNG to assist the District with crime control,\" without a request from local officials.",
      "Separately, Cobb said federal law \"cannot support the out-of-state National Guards' operations in the District because there is no state-law basis for those Guards to travel to the District.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has dispatched National Guard forces to several other cities in recent months, often to protect federal agents and property during immigration crackdowns \u2014 drawing local pushback and mixed results in court.",
      "Members of the California National Guard were deployed to Los Angeles over the summer, despite opposition from Gov. Gavin Newsom. And hundreds of out-of-state National Guard forces were later sent to Chicago and Portland, Oregon, though many of those troops are set to return home, a Defense Department official confirmed to CBS News last weekend.",
      "The Trump administration has argued the deployments were justified because of tense protests against immigration agents, pointing to Title 10, a law that allows the Guard to be used when \"there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the government of the United States.\" Local officials have said the deployments are unnecessary and inappropriate, arguing that local police can handle the protests themselves.",
      "A panel of appeals court judges allowed Mr. Trump's Los Angeles deployment to go forward over the summer, following a lawsuit from Newsom, but a judge later found the troops had illegally engaged in civilian law enforcement. In Chicago and Portland, judges blocked\u00a0Guard forces from being deployed onto the streets, leaving them in a holding pattern for weeks.",

    "story": [
      "A Treasury Department analysis indicates that new U.S. sanctions on Russian oil producers have sent prices there tumbling, choking off a key revenue source that Russia has used to fund its war in Ukraine, the department said.",
      "One key benchmark for Russian oil prices \u2014 Urals crude \u2014 had fallen by at least 21% since a set of new sanctions were announced last month, a Treasury official said Thursday. The official also pointed to a decrease in the amount of oil departing from Russia to unknown destinations and said transaction volume has decreased.",
      "The sanctions, announced Oct. 22, target Russian oil giants Lukoil and Rosneft. They represent the first direct actions against Russia of the second Trump administration and some of the most aggressive since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. Since the announcement, nearly a dozen major Indian and Chinese purchasers of Russian oil have stated intentions to pause their purchases of Russian oil deliveries for December, Treasury has said.",
      "A November 17 memo from the Treasury's Sanctions Economic Analysis Division assessed that the \"sanctions on Russian energy firms Lukoil and Rosneft are having their intended effect of dampening Russian revenues by lowering the price of Russian oil and therefore the country's ability to fund its war effort against Ukraine.\"",
      "The memo said that several grades of Russian oil are trading at multi-year lows, and are \"well below all other international prices.\"",
      "The memo also indicated that sanctions are \"likely to have a long-term negative impact on the quantity of Russian oil sold.\"",
      "The sanctions set a Friday, Nov. 21, deadline for companies to wind down dealings with Rosneft and Lukoil. Nearly three dozen entities are petitioning Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control for additional time to wind down operations, which would take them beyond the original deadline. That is not unusual, as companies work to comply with U.S. sanctions.",
      "Treasury has issued some extensions already for certain transactions involving Lukoil's retail service stations and contracts for the sale of the firm's international assets until Dec. 13. A separate waiver for deals pertaining to Lukoil's entities in Bulgaria was extended through April 29, according to a CBS review of the licenses.",
      "A Treasury official also said Thursday that many Chinese and Indian entities \u2014 including banks and refineries \u2014 are conscious of the sanctions and are \"risk averse, do recognize the importance of the relationships with the West, and are moving to comply.\"",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last month the sanctions on Russia's largest oil companies were driven by President Vladimir Putin's \"refusal to end this senseless war.\" Treasury said the companies have helped to \"fund the Kremlin's war machine.\"",
      "Last month on CBS News' \"Face the Nation,\" Bessent told moderator Margaret Brennan that the latest actions could cut Russia's oil revenue 20% or 30%. A Treasury official said the impacts are still being assessed, but that \"it is clear that there will be revenue impacts\" from the sanctions.",

      "The sheriff's office in Mecklenburg County, which includes Charlotte, said federal officials have confirmed with Sheriff Garry McFadden that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection operation known as \"\u00a0Charlotte's Web,\" has officially concluded. No border agent operations will occur on Thursday, a news release from the sheriff's office said.",
      "\"It is important to clarify that while the 'Charlotte's Web' operation has ended, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will continue to operate in Mecklenburg County as they always have,\" the news release said. \"ICE maintains full authority to detain, apprehend, and take into custody any undocumented immigrant in accordance with federal law.\"",
      "But Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin denied the operation has concluded, saying in a statement, \"The operation is not over and it is not ending anytime soon.\" A DHS spokesperson also touted the arrests of 370 people illegally in the U.S. in the last five days and said in a statement that the department and federal agencies \"continue to target some of the most dangerous criminal illegal aliens as Operation Charlotte's Web progresses.\"",
      "The operation that began in Charlotte over the weekend led to hundreds of arrests, according to authorities. It was part of President Trump's aggressive mass deportation efforts, which have sent the military and immigration agents into Democratic-run cities, from Chicago to Los Angeles.",
      "The push to carry out arrests in North Carolina expanded to areas around the state capital of Raleigh on Tuesday. Late Wednesday, Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell said on X that \"border patrol enforcement appears to have been suspended\" in the city.",
      "The number of arrests around Charlotte and beyond was about double the total announced by Homeland Security officials earlier this week.

Federal officials have offered few details about those arrested. They've also remained quiet about the scope of the enforcement operations across North Carolina and where agents will show up next, keeping communities on edge. The crackdown in Charlotte has been met with pockets of resistance and protests.",
      "Immigration officials have blanketed the country since January, pushing detention counts to all-time highs above 60,000.

    "story": [
      "Greenbelt, Md. \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday expressed frustration with the Trump administration over the testimony provided by a top immigration official who was called to address the steps the Trump administration has taken to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the West African country of Liberia.",
      "John Cant\u00fa, a senior official at Enforcement and Removal Operations at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, was the latest government witness to appear before U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis to answer questions about the potential removal of Abrego Garcia. But in each instance, Xinis has pushed back on the substance of the testimony.",
      "\"Today was a zero in my view,\" she said of Cant\u00fa's appearance.",
      "Abrego Garcia is challenging the Trump administration's efforts to remove him from the U.S. ahead of his criminal trial on human smuggling charges next year. Immigration authorities are now seeking to deport Abrego Garcia to Liberia, but an order from Xinis that's been in place since August prevents the government from removing him.",
      "Xinis did not rule on Abrego Garcia's bid for release but said she would move quickly to address his challenge.",
      "Cant\u00fa was summoned to testify after submitting a declaration to the court about a discussion between the State Department and the Costa Rican government about possibly accepting Abrego Garcia, as well as his potential deportation to Liberia. Abrego Garcia has designated Costa Rica as a country he is willing to be removed to, but the Trump administration has instead sought to deport him to a series of African countries.",
      "Cant\u00fa said that if the Trump administration had the green light to remove Abrego Garcia from the U.S., the government would schedule a commercial flight or charter a plane bound for Liberia. He said that the Liberian government provided assurances to the State Department that Abrego Garcia would not be persecuted, tortured or sent back to El Salvador.",
      "Asked about the declaration filed with the court, Cant\u00fa said he included in it information that was provided to him by the State Department.",
      "Xinis repeatedly expressed frustration with the quality of the testimony from Cant\u00fa and at least two other federal officials who have appeared before her to answer questions about the Trump administration's plans to deport Abrego Garcia.",
      "She said Cant\u00fa's answers were \"the worst of all.\"",
      "\"I've had three witnesses do this. This witness knew nothing. He didn't know the meaning of the words in his own affidavit,\" she said. \"That's extremely troubling.\"",
      "Xinis also questioned Justice Department lawyers as to whether a final order of removal had ever been issued for Abrego Garcia. A U.S. immigration judge in 2019 denied Abrego Garcia's bid for asylum but granted him a withholding of removal, which bars immigration authorities from deporting him to his home country of El Salvador.",
      "But Abrego Garcia's lawyers said they have not seen a final order of removal, which they said bolstered their argument for releasing him from immigration custody.",
      "Abrego Garcia's case has been a flashpoint in the Trump administration's immigration crackdown since the Salvadoran immigrant was removed from where he lived in Maryland to his native country in March. He was sent to El Salvador despite the immigration judge's 2019 decision.",
      "He faces deportation proceedings because he entered the U.S. illegally as a teenager in 2011.",
      "In June, Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. after he was detained in El Salvador's notorious mega-prison to face two felony charges of human smuggling. He has denied those charges.",
      "Ahead of Abrego Garcia's criminal trial that is scheduled to begin next year, the Trump administration has repeatedly sought to deport him from the U.S. again, proposing to send him to countries including Uganda, Eswatini and now, Liberia.",
      "The Trump administration is urging Xinis to lift her August order barring Abrego Garcia's deportation and allow the government to remove him to Liberia, arguing that the administration has gone through all the necessary steps to deport Abrego Garcia.",
      "The Justice Department said that Abrego Garcia, who remains in federal immigration detention, was interviewed in October by a U.S. government asylum officer, and that officer determined that he failed to prove he would face persecution or torture in Liberia. The Justice Department said any additional due process would be unwarranted.",
      "Abrego Garcia's \"claims are procedurally barred multiple times over and fail on the merits in any event,\" the Justice Department said in its filing. \"This Court should therefore dissolve its preliminary injunction and permit the government to remove Petitioner to Liberia.\"",
      "In addition, the Justice Department submitted declarations from U.S. officials stating that Liberia has made \"sufficient and credible\" assurances that Abrego Garcia would not be harmed there or removed from Liberia to another country where he potentially could be persecuted.",
      "In a press release late last month, Liberia's government said it had agreed to receive Abrego Garcia on \"a strictly humanitarian and temporary basis,\" following a U.S. request.",
      "Andrew Rossman, a lawyer for Abrego Garcia, raised concerns about the lack of detail surrounding how long he could remain in Liberia and what would happen once that clock ran out.",
      "\"Is Liberia going to send him to yet another unnamed country?\" he asked.",
      "Abrego Garcia and his legal team have repeatedly challenged the government's attempts to deport him to African nations, claiming fear of persecution or torture. They have also argued that the Trump administration's repeated efforts to send Abrego Garcia to Africa is a form of retaliation, and Abrego Garcia should instead be sent to Costa Rica.",
      "They noted the government had offered to send Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica this summer, but only if he pleaded guilty to the federal human smuggling charges he faces in Tennessee. The Costa Rican government initially said it was willing to accept Abrego Garcia after the conclusion of any criminal sentence he would serve, if convicted of the human smuggling charges.",
      "But Justice Department lawyers said earlier this month that the State Department had assessed that the Costa Rican government had reversed course and wouldn't take Abrego Garcia \"at this time without further negotiations\" and additional commitments from the U.S.",
      "Drew Ensign, a Justice Department lawyer, said that continuing negotiations with Costa Rica is \"not something that could easily be done.\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had also \"determined that it would be preferential in the interests of the United States,\" to send Abrego Garcia to an African country,\" Ensign said.",
      "\"It's so odd to me, it's so odd. And that's being polite,\" Xinis replied, citing the \"empty word salad\" declaration she got from Cant\u00fa and the Trump administration's lack of willingness to move forward with Costa Rica as the final deportation spot for Abrego Garcia.",
      "But Rossman questioned the government's assertion that Costa Rica is off the table and told the judge \"there is no evidence at all that Costa Rica is unwilling to take my client.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers have argued that federal immigration officials are seeking to punish their client and denying him due process.",
      "\"The timeline suggests a pattern: when the Government received orders it disliked in Abrego Garcia's civil case challenging his unlawful removal to El Salvador; it initiated a criminal prosecution in retaliation; and when it received orders it disliked in Abrego Garcia's criminal case, it initiated third-country removal efforts in retaliation,\" the attorneys said in a response to the Justice Department's motion.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys have also asked Xinis to keep her block on his deportation in place \"unless and until an immigration judge concurs\" with the Trump administration's determinations.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, blocked a Democrat-led effort to approve a House-passed measure to repeal a controversial provision that allows senators to sue for $500,000 if federal investigators search their phone records without their knowledge.",
      "Sen. Martin Heinrich, a New Mexico Democrat, sought unanimous consent to approve the measure after the House unanimously passed the bill Wednesday, saying the provision many lawmakers are looking to repeal, which was tucked in last week's funding package, represents a country that \"is not serving the people.\"",
      "\"Last week Republicans in Congress passed a government funding bill that denies affordable health care to millions of Americans,\" Heinrich said. \"But what most people don't know is that they also voted to provide millions of dollars to a few Republican senators in a blatant, tax-funded cash grab.\"",
      "The new law requires service providers to notify senators if their phone records or other data are seized or subpoenaed, and senators are entitled to $500,000 for each violation. It also applies retroactively to 2022, allowing the senators whose phone records were seized during special counsel Jack Smith's investigation into the 2020 election to sue the federal government.",
      "But Graham, one of the senators whose phone records were subpoenaed, blocked the bill. Any single lawmaker has the power to block a bill's passage under unanimous consent rules.",
      "\"What did I do wrong?\" Graham said, refuting the idea that it was a lawful subpoena. \"What did I do to allow the government to seize my personal phone and my official phone when I was Senate Judiciary chairman?\"",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 09:09:02 -0500",
    "summary": "The court ruling came after California voters formally approved a ballot measure that was introduced to counteract Texas' redistricting.",
    "story": [
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom said California's redistricting would counter Texas' rare mid-decade redistricting push. That doesn't mean California is turning back after a federal court in Texas blocked the state's recently redrawn congressional map from going into effect for the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "Tuesday's court ruling came weeks after California voters formally approved a ballot measure that was introduced to counteract Texas' redistricting. The California measure originally included trigger language that said the state would only redraw its congressional map in response to a similar move by a Republican-led state, but legislators removed the language before voters went to the polls.",
      "\"Donald Trump and Greg Abbott played with fire, got burned and democracy won,\" Newsom wrote on X Tuesday following the court ruling. \"This ruling is a win for Texas, and for every American who fights for free and fair elections.\"",
      "Paul Mitchell, whose firm was hired to draw California's congressional districts, posted on social media that the maps will be staying in place.",
      "\"The trigger language was removed in the legislative process as it was clear that TX was redistricting. So, even if their map is invalidated/postponed, the Prop 50 maps stay in place,\" Mitchell wrote.",
      "Earlier this year, Texas lawmakers redrew their congressional maps in a rare mid-decade redistricting effort, which kicked off after President Trump pushed for new congressional district boundaries that could help secure five Republican-friendly seats.",
      "The move set off a redistricting battle across the U.S., with Newsom \u2014 a potential 2028 presidential candidate \u2014\u00a0 leading an effort to neutralize potential Republican gains in Texas by redrawing California's own congressional lines to net up to five seats for Democrats.",
      "In August, California lawmakers approved several bills to redraw the state's congressional map to potentially make five Republican-held congressional districts more favorable to Democrats. Because the measures required changes to the state's constitution, they had to be put before voters in a special election.",
      "Earlier this month, California voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition 50, setting the stage for newly-drawn congressional maps for the 2026 midterms.",
      "California lawmakers removed trigger clause",
      "When California state lawmakers initially introduced their redistricting legislation, it included a trigger clause under which California would only redraw its congressional map in response to a similar move by a Republican state.",
      "Under that trigger language, California's redistricting map would \"become operative only if Texas, Florida, or another state adopts a new congressional district map that takes effect after Aug. 1, 2025, and before Jan. 1, 2031, and such redistricting is not required by a federal court order.\"",
      "However, the trigger clause was removed just before California lawmakers voted on the redistricting bills. Without that trigger language, as it stands now, the Texas ruling does not impact California's redrawn map.",
      "During an August press conference, Newsom was asked if California would move forward with Proposition 50 even if a court were to strike down Texas' maps.",
      "\"We're moving forward,\" Newsom responded. \"Texas moved forward. Texas acted. Texas is moving forward. You're suggesting, people are suggesting. Texas is not going to move forward because of what we just did? Come on.\"",
      "The Trump administration has sued California over its new congressional lines. A hearing is scheduled for Dec 3.",
      "Meanwhile, the Trump administration denounced the ruling striking down Texas' maps. Texas on Tuesday afternoon appealed the ruling striking down its maps to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "\"We strongly disagree with today's district court ruling on Texas's redistricting map - Texas's map was drawn the right way for the right reasons,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on X. \"We look forward to Texas's victory at the Supreme Court.\"",
      "According to Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, the ruling invalidating Texas maps would not have an effect on California's redistricting efforts given the facts that were considered by the court.",
      "\"Texas maps were struck down by the court based on how Texas actually drew the lines, and that has very little to do with how California drew their lines,\" Levitt told CBS News.",
      "In the Texas ruling, in a 2-1 decision, federal judges found \"substantial evidence\" that \"Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 map.\" The court considered a letter that the Justice Department sent to Texas lawmakers in July stating the state's 2021 map was \"unconstitutional\" because it included four congressional districts where no ethnic group had an outright majority, concluding that the state must therefore dismantle and redraw its lines.",
      "The court found this to be a \"legally incoherent assertion.\"",
      "\"California didn't do anything like that,\" Levitt said. \"California drew districts overwhelmingly for partisan reasons and there's actually nothing that the litigants in California have pointed to that indicates that California focused predominantly or excessively based on race.\"",
      "The Supreme Court is expected to weigh in on a dispute over Louisiana's congressional map and whether race can be used as a factor when drawing districts. In October, justices appeared poised to weaken a key provision, Section 2, of the Voting Rights Act that has allowed the consideration of race when drawing districts, and has been used to ensure minority voters have the opportunity to elect their preferred candidates.",
      "This could lead to more redistricting efforts as states eliminate race as a factor for their standing congressional voting lines.",
      "\"It is terribly disturbing that this is where we are at,\" Texas Democratic state Rep. Ramon Romero told CBS News. \"A point where communities that have been so grossly underrepresented for basically our entirety of the history of our country and now that there's growth in opportunity, there's growth in education, there's growth in representation, those wealthy billionaires that are manipulating our country for their benefit have won at the expense of so many families and people of color.\"",
      "Romero was among the Texas lawmakers who broke quorum in August by leaving the state in attempts to block the GOP-backed congressional maps. Though he says today's ruling was a victory for Democrats, much remains to be determined after the Supreme Court weighs in.",
      "The timing of a Supreme Court decision is unknown, but the clock is ticking for Texas. Congressional candidates have until Dec. 8 to file to run for next year's midterm election and appear on the primary ballot set for March.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's administration moved Wednesday to roll back protections for imperiled species and the places they live, reviving a suite of changes to Endangered Species Act regulations from the Republican's first term that were blocked under former Democratic President Joe Biden.",
      "The proposed changes include the elimination of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's \"blanket rule\" that automatically protects animals and plants when they are classified as threatened. Government agencies instead would have to craft species-specific rules for protections, a potentially lengthy process.",
      "The administration's announcement answers longstanding calls for revisions to the Endangered Species Act from Republicans in Congress and industries including oil and gas, mining and agriculture. The president has voiced frustration with the\u00a01973 law\u00a0and similar environmental protections, saying environmentalists are impeding growth. Critics argue the landmark 1973 environmental law has been wielded too broadly, to the detriment of economic growth.",
      "But environmentalists warned the changes could cause yearslong delays in efforts to save species such as the\u00a0monarch butterfly, Florida\u00a0manatee, California spotted owl\u00a0and North American wolverine.",
      "Scientists and government agencies say extinctions are accelerating globally because of habitat loss and other pressures.",
      "Mr. Trump has made oil and gas production a centerpiece of his presidency and sought to strip away environmental regulations that impede development. Other pending proposals from the administration would revise the definition of \"harm\"\u00a0under the Endangered Species Act and potentially bypass species protections for logging projects in national forests and on public lands.",
      "Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement that the administration was restoring the Endangered Species Act to its original intent while respecting \"the livelihoods of Americans who depend on our land and resources.\"",
      "\"These revisions end years of legal confusion and regulatory overreach, delivering certainty to states, tribes, landowners and businesses while ensuring conservation efforts remain grounded in sound science and common sense,\" Burgum said in a statement.",

      "In April, a White House official confirmed to CBS News that Mr. Trump planned to overhaul the Endangered Species Act to make it easier to build in the U.S. where endangered species live. The president\u00a0directed\u00a0agencies regulating energy and the environment to sunset a number of environmental protections, among other steps to curb environmental protections to spur construction and economic growth.",
      "Case of lizard shows potential outcome of proposals",
      "The case of the Yarrow's spiny lizard in the Southwest exemplifies the potential consequences of the proposals. Rapidly warming temperatures have ravaged a population of the lizard in Arizona's Mule Mountains, pushing the reptiles further up the mountainsides toward the highest peaks and possibly toward extinction.",
      "A petition filed Wednesday seeks protections for the lizard and the designation of critical habitat. Advocates say analyzing the economic impacts could delay protections. Designating critical habitat could be another hurdle because the primary threat to this population of spiny lizard is climate change.",
      "\"We think that the species should be listed as endangered. In fact, we are somewhat shocked that it is not already extinct,\" said John Wiens, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona, who co-authored the petition.",
      "The move comes 18 months after\u00a0CBS News first reported\u00a0on the lizard's disappearance from much of its historic range. At that time, Wiens and our team hiked to the top of the Mule Mountains under ideal weather conditions for finding lizards but found none.",
      "But Wiens, whose scientific protocol requires multiple surveys, returned twice more and both times found about a half-dozen on a few scattered rock outcrops near the summit.",
      "\"You have to go back. You have to be rigorous,\" Wiens told CBS News.",
      "The Interior Department was sued over the blanket protection rule in March, by the Property and Environment Research Center (PERC) and Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation. The two groups argued the rule was illegal and discouraged states and landowners from assisting in species recovery efforts.",
      "Species designated as \"threatened\" under the rule automatically qualify for the same protections as those with the more severe designation of \"endangered.\"",
      "PERC Vice President Jonathan Wood said Wednesday's proposal was a \"necessary course correction.\"",
      "\"This reform acknowledges the blanket rule's unlawfulness and puts recovery back at the heart of the Endangered Species Act,\" Wood said.",
      "Proposals would undermine protections, critic says",
      "Kristen Boyles with the environmental law firm Earthjustice said the changes undermine protections even more than in Mr. Trump's first term. That includes allowing the Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service to not count negative effects on species if those impacts are not regulated by the agencies themselves, Boyles said.",
      "\"The Services are required to prevent harmful consequences to species, not ignore them,\" she said.",
      "Trump officials during his first term also rolled back protections for individual species including the northern spotted owl and gray wolf.",
      "The spotted owl decision was reversed in 2021 after officials said Mr. Trump's political appointees used faulty science to justify opening millions of acres of West Coast forest to potential logging. Protections for wolves across most of the U.S. were restored by a federal court in 2022.",
      "The Endangered Species Act protects more than 1,600 species in the United States and its territories. In the more than 50 years since the law was enacted, the\u00a0act has been credited with saving 99% of the listed species. Notable species saved include the bald eagle, American alligators, whooping cranes and peregrine falcons.",
      "CBS News\u00a0reported\u00a0in 2023 that since the passage of the law, more than 1,7000 plants, mammals, fish, insects and other species in the U.S. have been listed as threatened or endangered. But federal data shows that of the roughly $1.2 billion a year spent on endangered and threatened species, about half goes toward recovery of just two types of fish:\u00a0salmon\u00a0and steelhead trout along the West Coast.",
      "Last month, an annual assessment from the International Union for Conservation of Nature said that arctic seals\u00a0are being pushed closer to extinction by climate change and more than half of\u00a0bird species\u00a0around the world are declining under pressure from deforestation and agricultural expansion. One bright spot is green sea turtles, which have recovered substantially thanks to decades of conservation efforts, the IUCN said as it released its latest\u00a0Red List of Threatened Species.",
      "David  Schechter and \n                                                  \n                                  Kathryn  Watson\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 07:53:22 -0500",
    "summary": "The U.S. Border Patrol is monitoring millions of American drivers nationwide in a secretive program to identify and detain people whose travel patterns it deems suspicious, The Associated Press has found.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Border Patrol is monitoring millions of American drivers nationwide in a secretive program to identify and detain people whose travel patterns it deems suspicious, The Associated Press has found.",
      "The Border Patrol's predictive intelligence program has resulted in people being stopped, searched and in some cases arrested. A network of cameras scans and records vehicle license plate information, and an algorithm flags vehicles deemed suspicious based on where they came from, where they were going and which route they took. Federal agents in turn may then flag local law enforcement.",
      "Suddenly, drivers find themselves pulled over - often for reasons cited such as speeding, no turn signals or even a dangling air freshener blocking the view. They are then aggressively questioned and searched, with no inkling that the roads they drove put them on law enforcement's radar.",
      "The AP's investigation, the first to reveal details of the program on America's roads, is based on interviews with eight former government officials with direct knowledge of the program who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak to the media, as well as dozens of federal, state and local officials, attorneys and privacy experts. The AP also reviewed thousands of pages of court and government documents, state grant and law enforcement data, and arrest reports.",
      "The Border Patrol's parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said they use license plate readers to help identify threats and disrupt criminal networks and are \"governed by a stringent, multi-layered policy framework, as well as federal law and constitutional protections, to ensure the technology is applied responsibly and for clearly defined security purposes.\"",
      "\"For national security reasons, we do not detail the specific operational applications,\" the agency said. While the U.S. Border Patrol primarily operates within 100 miles of the border, it is legally allowed \"to operate anywhere in the United States,\" the agency added.",
      "The program has been growing",
      "Once limited to policing the nation's boundaries, the Border Patrol's surveillance system stretches into the country's interior and monitors ordinary Americans' daily actions and connections for anomalies instead of simply targeting wanted suspects. Started about a decade ago to fight illegal border-related activities and the trafficking of both drugs and people, it has expanded over the past five years.",
      "Border Patrol has for years hidden details of its license plate reader program, trying to keep any mention of the program out of court documents and police reports, according to two people familiar with the program. Readers are often disguised along highways in traffic safety equipment like drums and barrels.",
      "The Border Patrol has defined its own criteria for which drivers' behavior should be deemed suspicious or tied to drug or human trafficking, stopping people for anything from driving on backcountry roads, being in a rental car or making short trips to the border region. The agency's network of cameras now extends along the southern border in Texas, Arizona and California, and also monitors drivers traveling near the U.S.-Canada border.",
      "The Border Patrol has recently grown even more powerful through collaborations with other agencies, drawing information from license plate readers nationwide run by the Drug Enforcement Administration, private companies and, increasingly, local law enforcement programs funded through federal grants. Texas law enforcement agencies have asked the Border Patrol to use facial recognition to identify drivers, documents show.",
      "This active role beyond the borders is part of the quiet transformation of its parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, into something more akin to a domestic intelligence operation. Under the Trump administration's heightened immigration enforcement efforts, CBP is now poised to get more than $2.7 billion to build out border surveillance systems such as the license plate reader program by layering in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.",
      "Concern about rights of monitored drivers",
      "While collecting license plates from cars on public roads has generally been upheld by courts, some legal scholars see the growth of large digital surveillance networks such as the Border Patrol's as raising constitutional questions.",
      "Courts have started to recognize that \"large-scale surveillance technology that's capturing everyone and everywhere at every time\" might be unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment, said Andrew Ferguson, a law professor at George Washington University.",
      "Nicole Ozer, the executive director of the Center for Constitutional Democracy at UC Law San Francisco, expressed alarm when told of AP's findings.",
      "\"They are collecting mass amounts of information about who people are, where they go, what they do, and who they know,\" she said. \"These surveillance systems do not make communities safer.\"",

    "summary": "A federal judge penned a heated dissent after this week's ruling that blocked Texas' redistricting effort, accusing the judge who wrote the majority opinion of \"outrageous conduct\" and \"cherry-picking of the highest order.\"",
    "story": [
      "One day after a Trump-appointed federal judge helped toss out Texas' redistricting effort, a Reagan-appointed judge penned a heated and invective-filled dissent accusing his fellow jurist of \"cherry-picking of the highest order.\"",
      "A three-judge panel ruled 2-1 on Tuesday that Texas must set aside the new congressional maps that it drew earlier this year, with Judge Jeffrey Brown writing for the majority that the map \u2014 which would create five new GOP-friendly House seats \u2014 was an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The ruling was issued by Brown and Judge David Guaderrama, nominated to the bench by President Trump and former President Barack Obama, respectively. The state of Texas quickly\u00a0appealed the ruling\u00a0to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "The ruling could upend this year's nationwide redistricting gambit. Multiple states have followed Texas' lead and redrawn their maps, including California, which made five congressional districts more friendly to Democrats in response.",
      "The panel's third member, Judge Jerry Smith, filed his response on Wednesday, writing the phrase \"I dissent\" some 16 times over the course of his 104-page opinion.",
      "Smith, nominated to the bench by former President Ronald Reagan in 1987, accused the two other judges of issuing the ruling without giving him enough time to respond, which he called an \"outrage.\" He wrote that in the days prior to the ruling, Brown sent him a pair of drafts that were more than 160 pages long, only offered a few days to react, and didn't wait for Smith to write his dissent.",
      "\"In my 37 years on the federal bench, this is the most outrageous conduct by a judge that I have ever encountered in a case in which I have been involved,\" Smith wrote.",
      "The dissent \u2014 which started by warning readers, \"Fasten your seatbelts. It's going to be a bumpy night!\" \u2014 also attacked the opinion itself in often-harsh terms. He called Brown an \"unskilled magician,\" compared his reasoning to a \"bizarre multiple-choice question from hell,\" and called the ruling the \"most blatant exercise of judicial activism that I have ever witnessed.\"",
      "At one point, when discussing the court's decision to grant a preliminary injunction, Smith writes: \"If this were a law school exam, the opinion would deserve an 'F.'\"",
      "Race or politics?",
      "At the heart of Smith and Brown's disagreement is whether Texas lawmakers redrew the state's House districts for partisan reasons or racial reasons.",
      "The map-drawing effort began after Mr. Trump and his allies pushed Texas officials over the summer to create as many as five new GOP-leaning seats, as Republicans fight to hold onto a razor-thin House majority in next year's midterms.",
      "At one point during that gambit, Harmeet Dhillon, who heads the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, sent Texas Gov. Greg Abbott a letter alleging that a handful of the state's existing districts were illegal \"coalition\" districts where non-Hispanic White voters are in the minority but no single racial group has a majority.",
      "Tuesday's majority opinion, penned by Brown, said that Abbott \"explicitly directed the Legislature to redistrict based on race\" and \"repeatedly stated that his goal was to eliminate coalition districts and create new majority-Hispanic districts.\"",
      "The court concluded that the state's redistricting effort was unconstitutional because it was driven by racial considerations, not pure politics. It's legal for lawmakers to redraw maps for partisan reasons, Brown wrote, but racially gerrymandered maps can be challenged in court.",
      "Smith disagreed, pointing to evidence that he said shows the new Texas maps were actually driven mainly by partisan politics rather than race.",
      "The judge cited testimony from one of the mapmakers, Adam Kincaid, who explained at length why he made certain decisions to shift around the boundaries of congressional districts. Smith said Kincaid \"had a perfectly legitimate and candidly partisan explanation for his every decision.\"",
      "Smith also noted at one point that California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who pushed to redraw his state's maps in response to Texas, \"took a victory lap\" after this week's ruling.",
      "\"That tells you all that you need to know\u2014this is about partisan politics, plain and simple,\" Smith said.",
      "In response Wednesday night, Newsom wrote on X: \"This judge says California's redistricting in response to Texas was overwhelmingly partisan. Yes, ours was. That was the ENTIRE POINT!\"",
      "Smith claimed the \"main winners from Judge Brown's opinion are George Soros and Gavin Newsom.\" He alleged Soros, the liberal megadonor, and his son, Alex Soros, \"have their hands all over this,\" claiming several lawyers and experts for the plaintiffs have links to groups that have received funding from the Soros family's Open Society Foundations.",
      "And Smith warned that, if the decision stands, it could disrupt next year's congressional races.",
      "\"As a legal and practical matter, Judge Brown's injunction turns the Texas electoral and political landscape upside down,\" he said. \"It creates mayhem, chaos, misinformation, and confusion.\"",
      "The League of United Latin American Citizens, one of the plaintiffs, said Smith's claim that the redistricting was purely political is \"flatly contradicted by the record.\" The group also rejected Smith's claim that the ruling would lead to \"chaos,\" saying the \"true risk would be allowing an unlawful, racially discriminatory map to stand.\"",
      "\"Protecting voters from racial discrimination is not activism; it is a constitutional obligation,\" LULAC CEO Juan Proa\u00f1o said. \"The majority acted responsibly to uphold the law and safeguard the rights of millions of Texans.\"",

      "GOP Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina introduced the censure resolution earlier Wednesday, citing troubling allegations against the congressman.",

I will not stay silent while a Member of Congress may be lining his pockets through federal contracts. And I will not look the other way while allegations of stolen valor, a slap in the face to every veteran who earned their service and sacrifice, goes unchecked,\" she said.",
      "The financial allegations revolve around a report by a congressional watchdog in August 2024 that found Mills may have misrepresented information on his campaign finance disclosure forms and may have \"entered into, held, or enjoyed contracts with federal agencies while he was a Member of Congress in violation of House rules, standards of conduct, and federal law.\"",

Many of the messages were from the late 2010s, well after Epstein pleaded guilty to prostitution charges in Florida, but before he was charged with sex trafficking in federal court and taken into custody in July 2019.",

    "story": [
      "Messages from the tranche of Jeffrey Epstein-related documents released by Congress on Nov. 13 shed new light on the deceased sex offender's effort to court billionaire Bill Gates.",
      "The newly released material from 2017 shows a series of text messages between Epstein and an apparent adviser to Gates, discussing the tech baron and other attendees at an annual banquet in Washington.",
      "Epstein had been hoping to sell Gates on a donor-advised fund, a tax-deductible charitable vehicle Epstein wanted to operate, but that never ultimately materialized.",
      "Gates was interested in the idea, the adviser said, but for the misgivings of one person who didn't want him communicating with Epstein: Gates' then-wife Melinda.",
      "\"He wants to talk to you but his wife won't let him,\" the adviser said. In a series of texts a minute later, the adviser said of Gates, \"he loves you,\" \"he says hi,\" and \"he feels bad about the [donor advised fund] btw He thought great idea but wife wouldn't allow.\"",
      "Later in the day, Epstein suggested to the same person that former Obama White House counsel Kathryn Ruemmler \"would love to sit with Melinda and give her the other side of Jeffrey.\" A source tells CBS News that meeting never took place.",
      "CBS News previously reported that Ruemmler, who is currently the chief legal officer at Goldman Sachs, was among Epstein's inner circle in the final years of his life. Ruemmler has described it as a business relationship; she is not accused of wrongdoing.",
      "Requests for comment sent to Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates were not immediately returned. The couple divorced in 2021 after 27 years of marriage.",
      "A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs declined to comment Wednesday. In October, they told CBS News that Ruemmler's relationship with Epstein was related to her work for her previous employer, the law firm Latham & Watkins.",
      "The Microsoft founder and philanthropist has previously sought to minimize his connection to Epstein, saying in 2019, \"I didn't have any business relationship or friendship with him.\" In 2021, after it became clear that Gates and Epstein had met repeatedly in the decade before Epstein's 2019 death, Gates called spending time with Epstein a \"huge mistake.\"",
      "Epstein's appointment calendar, released by Congress in September, shows several meetings with Gates, who previously said he had met with Epstein while seeking contributions and connections for his global health philanthropy.",
      "Gates is among a slew of famous and powerful people who have long sought to publicly downplay their connections to Jeffrey Epstein. In some cases, documents have come to light showing they in fact had more involved relationships than they've acknowledged.",
      "Epstein was a prolific networker who sought to build relationships with world leaders, business titans and celebrities, often casting himself as a middleman who could connect the powerful.",
      "His ability to build an elite social circle continued even after he had become a registered sex offender,\u00a0 following a 2008 deal with prosecutors in Florida that allowed Epstein to plead guilty to lesser state charges. He then was able to return to his globetrotting life.",
      "As cache after cache of Epstein's personal communications, flight logs and calendars have come out, many of his friends and acquaintances have faced blowback. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said Wednesday he is resigning from the board of OpenAI and leaving a number of other roles following newly surfaced communications between him and Epstein.",
      "On Tuesday, both houses of Congress passed a bill that would require the Justice Department to release nearly all of its investigative files on Epstein.",
      "President Trump has indicated he will sign the bill, which gives the Justice Department 30 days to comply.",

      "\"We have a mission and we're here to do that mission,\" Peters said.",
      "On Tuesday, while their representative was speaking at the U.S. Capitol, the group was bagging lunches for school children and trying to avoid the partisan, political winds raging in Washington, D.C.",
      "When it comes to the growing feud between Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of President Trump's earliest and most vocal supporters, there is faith, loyalty, and a respect for being true to one's own self.",
      "Earlier that day, Greene had joined other Republicans and Democrats outside the Capitol with several survivors of\u00a0Jeffrey Epstein's\u00a0abuse, before\u00a0Congress voted\u00a0to force the Justice Department to release files related to the convicted sex offender.",
      "Greene's push to release more documents connected with the case has led to a rift between her and Mr. Trump, who recently called her a traitor and announced that he would support a primary challenge against her.",
      "\"Marjorie does what she genuinely believes is right, whether it be on President Trump's agenda or not,\" Rome resident Susan Cooper said. \"And she's very much an individual, and she is standing up, as far as this Epstein, for women, and for the victims. And it's not political for her, and I do admire her for that.\"",
      "Here, there is resistance to being drawn into political crossfire between two leaders who are both popular among residents in Greene's district.",
      "\"I really don't think she's totally changed, but I think she's trying to do the right thing for these ladies,\" one Rome resident told CBS News Atlanta.",
      "While their faith \u2014 personal or political \u2014 might be tested, it appears that, for now, Greene's support among party leaders in her district is unshakeable.",
      "\"It's a lot like when she stood up for the health care\u00a0\u2014 Obamacare. It wasn't that she was trying to be different. She was just defending a lot of people in this district because we have so many rural, needy families here,\" Cooper said. \"Clearly, from what we're doing right now, she just cares about people.\"",
      "And despite the bruising verbal combat between the two party leaders, the mission on Tuesday was to fix hunger, not sling mud.",

      "Annie Farmer, who testified that she was sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein\u00a0and Ghislaine Maxwell when she was 16 years old, said Congress' vote on the Epstein files \"feels like a victory, a long overdue victory.\"",
      "Both chambers of Congress passed a bill that would force the release of the Justice Department's Epstein files following President Trump's signature.",

      "\"In terms of names of people that not only participated in these crimes but the people that enabled the crimes and the people that funded the crimes,\" she told \"CBS Mornings\" on Wednesday.",
      "The Senate unanimously approved the Epstein Files Transparency Act to compel the documents release, following the House's 427 to 1 vote. The passage comes after months of opposition by many Republicans, including Mr. Trump, who recently changed his stance.",
      "\"I think that they felt pressure to get on the right side of history here because it was becoming so clear that this wasn't going away, that people cared about it,\" Farmer said.",
      "\"I feel hopeful\"",
      "Now, Farmer is hopeful for transparency, adding Tuesday's moment was bittersweet because of what it took to get there.",
      "\"I feel hopeful not because I have a lot of trust in the political process, but because of what I've seen, what is possible when people come together and demand something and pressure is placed by the American people here,\" she said. \"I appreciate everyone who spoke out about this.\"",
      "But she admitted she still has concerns about getting full transparency.",
      "Farmer's sister, Maria, who is also a survivor of Epstein's abuse and was one of the first in 1996 to report it to law enforcement, has made Freedom of Information Act requests for documents related to investigations of Epstein over the years.",
      "\"The things that have been released have been heavily redacted and, therefore, you know, really not very helpful,\" Farmer said.",
      "Earlier this month, Mr. Trump asked the Department of Justice to investigate Epstein's ties to prominent Democrats, even though the FBI said over the summer that they had conducted an \"exhaustive review\" of Epstein-related materials and \"did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\"",
      "\"So these files should be available now. They should not be tied up in any kind of investigation,\" she said. \"But we're concerned about things like that, that might get in the way of what we're looking for.\"",
      "Maxwell's sentence",
      "Farmer testified at Maxwell's trial in 2021. A key accuser in the trial, Farmer said that she went to Epstein's New Mexico ranch in 1996 hoping he and Maxwell would help with academic endeavors. Farmer told jurors at the trial that Maxwell allegedly massaged her breasts and Epstein climbed into bed with her without her permission.",
      "Earlier this month, CBS News reported Maxwell planned to ask Mr. Trump to commute her sentence, according to documents obtained by Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee.",
      "\"She needs to serve her full sentence,\" Farmer said about Maxwell, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022 for her role in the Epstein sex abuse case.",
      "\"She harmed so many more than just individuals that were involved in the trial and so I think to now see her getting this special treatment and potentially be receiving some kind of pardon, it's really unfathomable,\" Farmer said.",
      "In a letter from Democrats to Mr. Trump, which was seen by CBS News, the lawmakers alleged Maxwell was receiving preferential treatment.",
      "\"Federal law enforcement staff working at the camp have been waiting on Ms. Maxwell hand and foot,\" says the letter signed by Rep. Jamie Raskin, the ranking Democrat on the committee.",
      "\"I think it's absolutely disgusting that she's getting this preferential treatment,\" Farmer said.",
      "Maxwell's attorneys have denied she is trying to get her sentence reduced and that she is receiving preferential treatment, saying, \"It is clear that no effort to fact check the credibility or veracity of the so-called 'whistleblower' was made.\"",
      "Justice and healing",
      "Farmer said what justice looks like is \"a complicated question.\"",
      "\"A big part of it is just recognition of what actually happened here,\" she said.",
      "She said her sister Maria hasn't been given any protections as a whistleblower and has been threatened.",
      "\"I think just the acknowledgment that, 'wow, what you did was so brave and this didn't need to happen.' That there have been mistakes made over and over by law enforcement that we don't want those things to continue happening,\" she said.",

      "President Trump said Tuesday he will designate Saudi Arabia as a major non-NATO ally, marking a step up in defense ties between the United States and the Gulf monarchy.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the move at a black-tie dinner at the White House in honor of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia. The two leaders signed a new strategic defense deal earlier in the day, and Mr. Trump said Monday the U.S. will sell F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia.",
      "The designation could open the door to further collaboration between Saudi Arabia and the U.S. military, including easier access to U.S.-made military equipment. It's also a symbolic move: Mr. Trump said in brief remarks Tuesday evening that it would take \"our military cooperation to even greater heights.\"",
      "There are currently 20 major non-NATO allies, including other Middle Eastern countries like Israel, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Egypt, Tunisia and Jordan.",
      "\"A stronger and more capable alliance will advance the interests of both countries, and it will serve the highest interests of peace,\" Mr. Trump said during Tuesday's dinner.",
      "The U.S.'s close relationship with Saudi Arabia dates back eight decades, bookended by a meeting between King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud and former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt aboard a U.S. Navy cruiser in 1945. The two countries have long cooperated on defense, and in recent decades, they have been bound together in part by a mutual rivalry with Iran.",
      "During Tuesday's meetings \u2014 marked by elaborate White House ceremonies and a military flyover \u2014 Mr. Trump pressed for even further military and economic cooperation with the Gulf state. The White House said\u00a0Tuesday that Saudi Arabia will buy hundreds of tanks and fighter jets and will partner with the U.S. on artificial intelligence and civil nuclear issues, while bin Salman pledged to invest nearly $1 trillion in the U.S., up from $600 billion.",
      "Members of Mr. Trump's family also have some business interests in the country. Mr. Trump insisted earlier Tuesday he has \"nothing to do\" with those deals, and \"they've done very little with Saudi Arabia, actually.\"",
      "Still unclear is whether Saudi Arabia will sign onto the Abraham Accords, a series of diplomatic deals brokered by Mr. Trump between Israel and majority-Muslim states like the United Arab Emirates. Most of those agreements were inked during the president's first term, and Mr. Trump told \"60 Minutes\" he believes Saudi Arabia will also join.",
      "During an Oval Office event earlier Tuesday, bin Salman told reporters he wants to join the accords but needs to see a path toward a Palestinian state. Mr. Trump added that the two leaders \"had a very good talk on the Abraham Accords.\"",
      "But Saudi Arabia's human rights record makes it a controversial U.S. partner. American intelligence agencies concluded in 2021 that bin Salman approved the 2018 killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist who regularly criticized the country's regime in the pages of The Washington Post.",

      "From Miami to San Diego, schools around the U.S. are seeing big drops in enrollment of students from immigrant families.",
      "In some cases, parents have been deported or voluntarily returned to their home countries, driven out by President Trump's sweeping immigration crackdown. Others have moved elsewhere inside the U.S.",
      "In many school systems, the biggest factor is that far fewer families are coming from other countries. As fewer people cross the U.S. border, administrators in small towns and big cities alike are reporting fewer newcomer students than usual.",
      "In Miami-Dade County Public Schools, about 2,550 students have entered the district from another country so far this school year - down from nearly 14,000 last year, and more than 20,000 the year before that. School board member Luisa Santos, who attended district schools herself as a young immigrant, said the trend is \"a sad reality.\"",
      "\"I was one of those arrivals when I was 8 years old,\" Santos said. \"And this country and our public schools - I'll never get tired of saying it - gave me everything.\"",
      "Collectively, the enrollment declines in Miami-Dade erased about $70 million from the district's annual budget, forcing administrators to scramble to cover the unexpected shortfall.",
      "The drops in immigrant students add to strains on enrollment at many traditional public schools, which have seen overall numbers dip due to demographic changes and students opting for alternatives like private schools and homeschooling. Despite needs for English instruction and social supports, the newcomers in some districts have helped to buoy enrollment and bring critical per-pupil funding in recent years.",
      "Alabama, Florida among states feeling impact",
      "In northern Alabama, Albertville City Schools Superintendent Bart Reeves has seen the local economy grow along with its Hispanic population, which for decades has been drawn by the area's poultry processing plants. Albertville soon will be getting its first Target store, a sign of the community's growing prosperity.",
      "Reeves' district is home to one of Alabama's largest Hispanic student populations, with about 60% identifying as Hispanic. But Reeves said the district's newcomer academy at a local high school hasn't been enrolling any new students.",
      "\"That's just not happening this year with the closure of the border,\" said Reeves, who expects the hit to his budget from enrollment declines will cost him about 12 teacher positions.",
      "One Sunday morning in August, Edna, a 63-year-old immigrant from El Salvador, got the call she had been dreading. Her friend, a mother from Guatemala with seven young children, had been detained in Lake Worth, Florida, on immigration charges while she was out grabbing a treat for her kids' breakfast.",
      "The family had prepared for this moment. There were legal documents in place granting temporary custody of the children to Edna, who asked to be identified only by her first name because she fears immigration enforcement.",
      "\"I'll be here, and we'll be OK,\" she recalled telling the oldest child, a 12-year-old boy.",
      "In the weeks that followed, Edna stayed home with two younger kids and got their five older siblings on the bus each day to attend Palm Beach County public schools, where enrollment has fallen by more than 6,000 students this year. One day in September, all seven children boarded a plane to Guatemala to be reunited with their mom, leaving behind neighborhood friends, band practices, and the only life they had ever known.",
      "\"My house feels like a garden without flowers,\" Edna said. \"They're all gone.\"",
      "The family is now living in a rural part of Guatemala, out of reach of phone service. School there had already started for the year and the mother, who did not attend school herself as a child, was keeping them home and weighing whether to enroll them next year, Edna said.",
      "The declines in the numbers of immigrants coming to the U.S. were already becoming evident in school registration numbers this summer.",
      "Effects showing in Denver, Chicago, Houston, Boston areas",
      "Denver Public Schools enrolled 400 new-to-country students this summer, compared to 1,500 during the previous summer. Outside Chicago, Waukegan Community Unified School District 60 signed up 100 fewer new immigrant students. And administrators in the Houston Independent School District shuttered the Las Americas Newcomer School, a program dedicated to children who are new to the U.S., after its enrollment fell to just 21 students from 111 last year.",
      "The shift is visible in places like Chelsea, Massachusetts, a city outside Boston that has long been a destination for new immigrants. The 6,000-student Chelsea Public Schools system has attracted Central Americans looking for affordable housing and, more recently, the state housed newly-arrived Haitians in shelters there. This year, the usual influx of newcomers didn't materialize.",
      "\"This year has been different. Much more quiet,\" said Daniel Mojica, director of Chelsea's parent information center.",
      "Over the summer, 152 newcomers signed up for Chelsea Public Schools, compared to 592 new-to-country students the previous summer.",
      "Some are also picking up and leaving. Since January, 844 students have withdrawn from the district, compared to 805 during the same period last year. Mojica said a greater share of students leaving - roughly a quarter - are returning to their native countries.",
      "He attributes that partly to the presence of masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers walking the city's streets.",

      "San Diego principal says academics not only aspects of kids' lives hit",
      "In San Diego, Principal Fernando Hernandez has enrolled dozens of newcomer students from across Latin America over the past couple of years. Many made the treacherous journey through the jungles of the Darien Gap before setting up camp in a park near Perkins K-8 school.",
      "About a third of students at the school are homeless. Staff members have become experts on supporting kids who are facing adversity. As more newcomers arrived, Hernandez watched as Mexican American students switched up their playground slang to be better understood by their new classmates from Venezuela, Colombia and Peru.",
      "But so far this school year, he hasn't enrolled a single newcomer student. Other families did not return when the new school year began.",
      "Hernandez fears the toll of the disruption will extend far beyond students' academic progress. He worries students are missing out on chances to learn how to show empathy, to share, to disagree, to understand each other.",
      "\"This is like a repeat of the pandemic where the kids are isolated, locked up, not socializing,\" he said.",
      "\"These kids, they have to be in school,\" he added.",
      "Natacha, a parent who moved with her family to California after leaving Venezuela, said she tries to avoid going out in public, but continues sending her daughters to school. Natacha, who asked to only be identified by her first name because she fears immigration enforcement, said she braces herself as she drives the girls home each afternoon, scanning the road behind her in case another car is following hers.",

      "NASA released close-up images on Wednesday of the rare interstellar comet that's making a single pass through the solar system.",
      "One of the images shows the comet, also known as\u00a03I/ATLAS, as it moves through space about 190 million miles from Earth. It was taken from Manciano, Italy.",
      "The comet was first discovered in July and has been photographed several times. In early August, images released showed the comet from about 277 million miles away. A month ago, images taken by two Mars orbiters showed a bright, fuzzy white dot of the comet about 18,641,135 miles away from Mars.",
      "3I/ATLAS is only the third ever interstellar comet confirmed to enter our solar system.",
      "The comet is visible from Earth in the predawn sky by using binoculars or a telescope.",
      "\"Everyone that is in control of a telescope wants to look at it because it's a fascinating and rare opportunity,\" NASA's acting astrophysics director, Shawn Domagal-Goldman, told The Associated Press.",
      "The comet will make its closest approach to Earth on Friday, Dec. 19, coming within about 170 million miles, which is nearly twice the Earth-Sun distance. NASA spacecraft will keep tracking it as it moves through the solar system, crossing Jupiter's orbit in spring 2026.",
      "ESA's Juice spacecraft, bound for Jupiter, has been training its cameras and scientific instruments on the comet all month, particularly after it made its closest pass to the sun. But scientists won't get any of these observations back until February because Juice's main antenna is serving as a heat shield while it's near the sun, limiting the flow of data.",
      "Named for the telescope in Chile that first spotted it, the comet is believed to be anywhere from 1,444 feet across to 3.5 miles across. Observations indicate that the exceptionally fast-moving comet may have originated in a star system older than our own \u2014 \"which gives me goose bumps to think about,\" said NASA scientist Tom Statler.",
      "\"That means that 3I/ATLAS is not just a window into another solar system, it's a window into the deep past and so deep in the past that it predates even the formation of our Earth and our sun,\" Statler told reporters.",

    "summary": "When the \"Star Trek\" actor and America's favorite astrophysicist share the stage, sparks can fly on an astronomical level. They talk about their bromance built on an appreciation of science and curiosity.",
    "story": [
      "Not long ago in Seattle, an astronomical event of sorts happened: Two superstars collided. William Shatner, of \"Star Trek\" fame, and Neil deGrasse Tyson, America's favorite astrophysicist, took to the stage to explore the nature of exploration. Think of it as sort of Martin & Lewis, but with more quantum mechanics.",
      "\"It's a bromance,\" said Tyson. \"I think what Bill Shatner and I have together should be the textbook definition of the bromance.\"",
      "\"If we have a bromance,\" said Shatner, \"I'd be very privileged.\"",
      "The two grew close last year on an upscale cruise to Antarctica, where they ended up being the after-dinner entertainment. \"The organizer said, 'Why don't we put the two of you on this mini-stage that they have on the ship, and we just chew the fat?'\" said Tyson. \"And then the organizer said, 'Why don't you guys take this on the road?'\"",
      "Their first port of call? Seattle, where they debuted a wide-ranging, sometimes meandering, but always intriguing stage show they're calling \"The Universe Is Absurd!\"",
      "When Shatner asked his partner for a sound bite, deGrasse Tyson solicited a suggestion from the audience: \"Pick anything out of the universe. Go. Anything. Doesn't matter.\"",
      "\"Pluto!\" yelled one enthusiastic audience member.",
      "DeGrasse Tyson obliged: \"More than half of Pluto is made of ice, so that, if it were where Earth is right now, heat from the Sun would evaporate that ice and it would grow a tail. And that is no kind of behavior for a planet!\" Mic drop. \"That's a sound bite!\"",
      "For deGrasse Tyson, director of New York City's Hayden Planetarium, and an authority on just about everything we know about the universe, it's a chance to get inside the insatiably curious mind of the 94-year-old Shatner. \"What kind of magic potion is he drinking?\" deGrasse Tyson laughed. \"By the way, you can do the math, he's been alive for three billion seconds, okay? I did the math, you don't have to. So when Bill Shatner speaks, it's coming from a place way deeper than any of the rest of us can possibly match.\"",
      "And for Shatner, who never formally studied astrophysics, it's a chance to make up for what he sees as lost time. \"I feel bad about it, because that knowledge of what constitutes the construction of nature, we know so little, but the little we know is so awesome, it's so spellbinding,\" he said. \"The fact that I wasn't conscious of how spellbinding it is as a youth, I could have been much more educated about it.\"",
      "Four years ago, Shatner became the oldest person ever to go into space, and he's been globetrotting ever since.",
      "Shatner asked deGrasse Tyson, \"Do you still scratch your head in awe?\"",
      "\"Every night I look up,\" he replied.",
      "So, is this the dynamic between the two \u2013 Shatner with questions, deGrasse Tyson with answers? \"Unfortunately, that's the way it is,\" Shatner replied.",
      "\"No, but he's got wisdom and life experience that I value, and I respect,\" deGrasse Tyson added. \"So, I'm here to grab some of that.\"",
      "As for Shatner's take on deGrasse Tyson, \"He has access, both because of his mentality, and the books and the studies, so he's into modern-day mysticism, which is the study of the stars and how it works and what goes on.\"",
      "\"You call that modern-day mysticism?\" deGrasse Tyson asked.",
      "\"Because you don't know for sure that what you're saying is absolutely truth until more experimentation.\"",
      "\"That's the frontier. We're scratching our heads.\"",
      "\"Exactly,\" said Shatner. \"So, he is an explorer. He is an explorer. He is on that verge. He teaches that. And it is mystical in every sense of the word.\"",
      "I asked, \"This is where I think you are politely and respectfully in disagreement, because Dr. deGrasse Tyson will say something like, 'We know what the speed of light is and what the fastest things can move is.' And you say, 'Well, we'll see about that!'\"",
      "\"Yeah, we've had that argument,\" said Shatner.",
      "DeGrasse Tyson seems just fine not knowing everything \u2013 for example, what was going on before the Big Bang, and the profound idea of somethingness coming from nothingness. \"We don't know. Next question!\" he said. \"No, as a scientist, you need to be comfortable in the presence of a question that does not yet have an answer.\"",
      "Of course, the ultimate question, the one we really don't know definitively, is where we go when we die, something that Shatner, as he loses friends and colleagues, finds himself considering more often. \"You know, I vary between the fear of death, my fear,\" he said. But, \"I have so much love around me. I have a wife, and children, and grandchildren. I even have two great-grandchildren. And I have two great dogs. I've had dogs all my life, all my adult life. And so, all my life is fertile, is vibrant. And I don't want to leave it. And that's the sadness. I don't want to go.\"",
      "\"Are you curious, though, about what you will find out?\" I asked.",
      "\"Not enough to die!\" he laughed.",
      "\"Even your curiosity has a limit?\"",
      "\"Right. It stops right there!\"",
      "So, William Shatner's famous curiosity bumps up against the edge of his universe. And as the show wrapped up in Seattle, Shatner closed things out with one of his unique spoken-word songs, accompanied by trumpeter Keyon Harrold.",
      "Do not grow oldno matter how long you live.Do not forget painbut somehow learn to forgive.",

    "published": "Sat, 15 Nov 2025 07:00:01 -0500",
    "summary": "The study sought to answer questions about how breast cancer risk differs by type of hormonal contraceptive. Doctors say the results won't change how they counsel patients.",
    "story": [
      "As misinformation about women's health spreads faster than ever, doctors say new research on the risks of hormonal birth control underscores the challenge of communicating nuance in the social media age.",
      "The massive study, which was conducted in Sweden and tracked more than two million teenage girls and women under age 50 for more than a decade, found that hormonal contraception remains safe overall, but also found small differences in breast cancer risk based on the hormones used in the formulation. In addition, the researchers observed a small, short-term rise in breast cancer diagnoses among current or recent users. Those findings are consistent with prior large studies, including a 2017 Danish registry analysis and a 2023 meta-analysis.",
      "It was published online Oct. 30 in JAMA Oncology.",
      "Doctors say these study results won't change how they advise patients and that women should not stop using their birth control.",
      "Still, TikTok is flooded with factually incomplete warnings that contraceptives cause cancer and are as dangerous as smoking. Reproductive health advocates warn that studies like this can easily be taken out of context online and be reduced to a single alarming number.",
      "Case in point: The study reported that women who had used hormonal birth control had about a 24% higher rate of breast cancer than women who hadn't. But because breast cancer is still uncommon in younger women, that works out to an increase from roughly 54 to 67 breast cancer cases per 100,000 women per year \u2014 about 13 extra cases per 100,000 women, or about one extra case per 7,800 users of hormonal contraceptives per year.",
      "Co-authors \u00c5sa Johansson and Dr. Fatemeh Hadizadeh, epidemiologists at Uppsala University, said the rise is modest and short-term, with risk highest during current use and fading within five to 10 years after stopping.",
      "Rachel Fey \u2014 interim co-CEO of Power to Decide, a group whose mission is to provide accurate information on sexual health and contraceptive methods \u2014 said that kind of nuance is exactly what tends to disappear on social media. \"I get really angry at this because it's designed to scare people like me away from birth control, which has made my life so much better in so many ways,\" she said. \"It's really frustrating \u2026 especially when it's given without context. And then in this era of social media, it can just take off without anybody who knows what they're talking about providing that context.\"",
      "The researchers also found the risk was slightly higher with certain progestins such as desogestrel \u2014 found in combined oral contraceptives like Cyred EQ, Reclipsen, Azurette, and Pimtrea \u2014 but did not increase with others, such as medroxyprogesterone acetate injections, sold under the brand name Depo\u2011Provera.",
      "How to interpret the findings",
      "Some experts say the results should be viewed with care because the study counted both invasive breast cancers and early, noninvasive lesions known as in situ tumors, growths that may never become life-threatening. Including these precancerous cases could make the overall risk of clinically significant disease appear higher than it is.",
      "\"A substantial proportion of the 'cases' would never have progressed to invasive breast cancer,\" said Lina S. M\u00f8rch, a senior researcher and team leader at the Danish Cancer Institute. M\u00f8rch was not associated with the Swedish study. She added that experts should wait for more data separating early-stage and advanced cancers before making new rules or warnings about specific hormones.",
      "The doctor-patient conversation",
      "Even as scientists debate how to interpret the finer points of the data, physicians emphasize that for most patients, the study reinforces what they already discuss in the exam room: that hormonal birth control is broadly safe, and decisions should be tailored to each woman's needs and values.",
      "Dr. Katharine White, chief of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Boston Medical Center, said this study won't change how she talks to her patients.",
      "\"When counseling patients about their contraceptive options, I focus on their past experiences with birth control, their medical history, and what's important to them about their birth control method and pregnancy planning (if applicable),\" White wrote in an email. \"Side effects and risks of methods are already a key part of my counseling about both hormonal and non-hormonal methods.\"",
      "Other doctors noted there are other contraceptive options.",
      "Dr. Eleanor Bimla Schwarz, chief of General Internal Medicine at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, said, \"For those who prefer hormone-free contraception, the copper IUD offers safe, convenient, highly effective contraception for over a decade after placement, and is rapidly reversible when pregnancy is desired,\" referring to a type of long-acting intrauterine device.",
      "Dr. Mary Rosser, director of Integrated Women's Health at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, said this was a large, high-quality study that looked at many types of hormones over many years. But she added that doctors shouldn't change their advice yet.",
      "Johansson and Hadizadeh stressed that the results should guide shared decision-making, not cause alarm. \"It may be reasonable to consider formulations associated with lower observed risk in our data,\" they said. They noted that products containing medroxyprogesterone acetate, drospirenone, or levonorgestrel were linked to lower risk, while long-term use of desogestrel-only contraceptives might be best avoided when other options fit.",
      "Keeping the risk in perspective",
      "Hormonal birth control provides many health benefits beyond pregnancy prevention. It can lighten heavy periods, ease pain from endometriosis, and lower the risk of ovarian and uterine cancers for years after stopping. M\u00f8rch noted that even small risks are worth discussing but said decisions should be guided by women's \"values and preferences.\"",
      "White said it's important to see the big picture. \"The risk of an unintended pregnancy is 85% for people who do not use contraception\u2014so any risks of birth control need to be weighed against the risk of an unexpected pregnancy,\" she wrote.",

    "summary": "Moss spores survived in outer space for a majority of 2022, and could even reproduce when they were eventually returned to Earth, according to a new study.",
    "story": [
      "Moss spores survived in outer space for a majority of 2022, and could even reproduce as usual when they were eventually returned to Earth, according to a new study from researchers who say their findings \"reveal the potential of terrestrial plants to endure extreme environments\" \u2014 including the extraterrestrial kind.",
      "\"Climate change highlights the importance of understanding life's survival limits for addressing global challenges and supporting future human habitation beyond Earth,\" reads the introductory text of the study, conducted by scientists at Hokkaido University in Japan. \"Understanding the resilience of Earth-born organisms in extreme and unfamiliar conditions, such as the space environment, is a crucial step toward expanding human habitats other than Earth like the Moon or Mars.\"",
      "The full text was published Thursday in the online journal iScience. It describes a pioneering effort to study bryophyte plants, such as moss, with the intent to learn more about the limits of their survival skills and gauge their adaptability. Although the plants' resilience was already well-known in environments on Earth, research on their survival limits more widely is still in its early stages, the study's authors said.",
      "For nine months, moss withstood the markedly harsh conditions of space \u2014 which very few Earthly creatures have ever done \u2014 while affixed to the outside of the International Space Station. While the spores' chlorophyll, which gives them their green color, did degrade during the experiment, scientists said more than 80% of them retained their viability after nine months outside of the space station.",
      "Different types of moss spores had individual strengths, like one that may protect against ultraviolet rays, heat and intensive light stresses, and another that \"could be used for planetary greening and life support systems,\" the authors said.",
      "Bryophytes have existed on Earth since at least 500 million years ago, when they began to advance from water onto land, scientists say. The plants continue to exist today despite the fact that Earth has changed considerably, and they have become known for their tolerance to desiccation, freezing and radiation, all of which made them good candidates to be studied in an extraterrestrial setting.",
      "In addition to surviving the 9-month period, the spores could still germinate after the experiment ended and scientists returned them back down to Earth, according to the study.",

    "summary": "The rare interstellar comet, also known as 3I/ATLAS, was first discovered in July and has been photographed several times.",
    "story": [
      "NASA released close-up images on Wednesday of the rare interstellar comet that's making a single pass through the solar system.",
      "One of the images shows the comet, also known as\u00a03I/ATLAS, as it moves through space about 190 million miles from Earth. It was taken from Manciano, Italy.",
      "The comet was first discovered in July and has been photographed several times. In early August, images released showed the comet from about 277 million miles away. A month ago, images taken by two Mars orbiters showed a bright, fuzzy white dot of the comet about 18,641,135 miles away from Mars.",
      "3I/ATLAS is only the third ever interstellar comet confirmed to enter our solar system.",
      "The comet is visible from Earth in the predawn sky by using binoculars or a telescope.",
      "\"Everyone that is in control of a telescope wants to look at it because it's a fascinating and rare opportunity,\" NASA's acting astrophysics director, Shawn Domagal-Goldman, told The Associated Press.",
      "The comet will make its closest approach to Earth on Friday, Dec. 19, coming within about 170 million miles, which is nearly twice the Earth-Sun distance. NASA spacecraft will keep tracking it as it moves through the solar system, crossing Jupiter's orbit in spring 2026.",
      "ESA's Juice spacecraft, bound for Jupiter, has been training its cameras and scientific instruments on the comet all month, particularly after it made its closest pass to the sun. But scientists won't get any of these observations back until February because Juice's main antenna is serving as a heat shield while it's near the sun, limiting the flow of data.",
      "Named for the telescope in Chile that first spotted it, the comet is believed to be anywhere from 1,444 feet across to 3.5 miles across. Observations indicate that the exceptionally fast-moving comet may have originated in a star system older than our own \u2014 \"which gives me goose bumps to think about,\" said NASA scientist Tom Statler.",
      "\"That means that 3I/ATLAS is not just a window into another solar system, it's a window into the deep past and so deep in the past that it predates even the formation of our Earth and our sun,\" Statler told reporters.",
      "NASA officials dismissed rumors that the \"friendly solar system visitor\" might actually be an alien spacecraft.",

    "story": [
      "A woman has pleaded guilty to falsely reporting that her astronaut ex-wife committed a crime while deployed to the International Space Station.",
      "Summer Heather Worden, 50, told law enforcement in July 2019 that her former spouse had illegally accessed her bank account earlier that year while she was in space, according to a news release from the Department of Justice. Her wife, previously identified as astronaut\u00a0Anne McClain, was at the ISS from December 2018 to June 2019. It was the first allegation of a crime being committed in space.",
      "An investigation by NASA's Office of the Inspector General found that Worden had opened the bank account in April 2018 and that both she and McClain had access to it until January 2019, the Justice Department said. The investigation also found that Worden had regularly given McClain access to her bank records, including login credentials, from at least 2015, the news release said.",
      "McClain said in 2019 that she had accessed the bank account with Worden's permission, The New York Times reported. Worden, a former Air Force intelligence officer, disputed that claim and filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission. A complaint filed to NASA's Office of Inspector General by Worden's family accused McClain of identity theft and improper access.",
      "McClain denied the allegations\u00a0on social media\u00a0and said that she and Worden had \"been going through a painful, personal separation that's now unfortunately in the media.\"",
      "Worden pleaded guilty to one count of lying to law enforcement on Nov. 13. She will be sentenced in February 2026. Worden faces up to 5 years in federal prison, as well as a maximum possible fine of $250,000, and remains on bond pending the hearing.",
      "McClain returned to the International Space Station in 2025. She participated in a spacewalk during the mission, years after she was set to take part in NASA's first all-female spacewalk, which was delayed at the last minute because there were not enough suits available after she requested a size adjustment. The first all-female spacewalk was conducted by\u00a0Christina Koch and Jessica Meir.",

    "summary": "The Sentinel-6B is the second of two satellites in a $1 billion program to monitor sea levels over a full decade.",
    "story": [
      "SpaceX launched a joint NASA-European environmental research satellite early Monday, the second in an ongoing billion-dollar project to measure long-term changes in sea level, a key indicator of climate change.",
      "The first satellite, known as Sentinel-6 and named in honor of NASA climate researcher Michael Freilich, was launched in November 2020. The latest spacecraft, Sentinel-6B, was launched from California atop a Falcon 9 rocket at 12:21 a.m. EST.",
      "Both satellites are equipped with a sophisticated cloud-penetrating radar. By timing how long it takes beams to bounce back from the ocean 830 miles below, the Sentinel-6 satellites can track sea levels to an accuracy of about one inch while also measuring wave height and wind speeds.",
      "The project builds on earlier missions dating back to the early 1990s that have provided an uninterrupted stream of sea level data.",
      "That data indicates sea levels are slowly but surely rising, widely interpreted as evidence of global warming caused in large part by human industrial activity.",
      "But in keeping with recent Trump administration policies aimed at scaling back climate research and the interpretation of such data, NASA did not directly refer to \"climate change\" or \"global warming\" in a Sentinel-6B pre-launch briefing Saturday.",
      "In the press kit released by NASA for the first Sentinel 6 mission in 2020, the first item in a \"need to know list\" said the satellite would \"provide information that will help researchers understand how climate change is reshaping Earth's coastlines \u2014 and how fast this is happening.\"",
      "In the press kit for the Sentinel 6B mission launched Monday, NASA's first \"need to know\" item said simply that \"Sentinel-6B will contribute to a multi-decade dataset that is ... key to helping improve public safety, city planning and protecting commercial and defense interests.\"",
      "Karen St. Germain, director of NASA's Earth Science Division, did not directly mention climate change in the Saturday briefing, focusing instead on the practical importance of monitoring sea levels.",
      "\"Sentinel 6B is the latest in a line of missions stretching over three decades, keeping an uninterrupted watch over our planet's sea surface height, finding patterns and advancing our understanding of planet Earth,\" she said.",
      "She said the data provided by the Sentinel-6 satellites \"underpins navigation, search and rescue and industries like commercial fishing and shipping. These measurements form the basis for U.S. flood predictions for coastal infrastructure, real estate, energy storage sites and other assets along our shoreline.\"",
      "The data, she continued, will help scientists \"understand and predict coastal erosion and salt water encroachment into inland supplies of water that are used for agriculture, irrigation as well as municipal drinking water.\"",
      "Regardless of interpretation, the launch of Sentinel-6B went off without a hitch.",
      "After blasting off from launch complex 4E at the Vandenberg Space Force Base, the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage powered the vehicle out of the dense lower atmosphere, separated and flew itself back to a landing pad at the California launch site.",
      "The upper stage then carried out two firings of its single engine before releasing the 2,600-pound Sentinel-6B into an 830-mile-high orbit tilted 66 degrees to the equator, the same orbit used by Sentinel-6A and earlier sea level-monitoring spacecraft.",
      "Taking 112 minutes to complete one orbit, the solar-powered satellite will fly over locations between 66 degrees north and south latitude, covering 90 percent of the world's oceans.",
      "Along with measuring sea levels, the new satellite will monitor temperature and humidity in the lower atmosphere as well as the higher-altitude stratosphere using an instrument that measures atmospheric effects on signals broadcast by navigation satellites.",
      "But the primary mission is monitoring Earth's changing sea levels.",
      "\"The dynamic balance that persisted before the industrial revolution has been upset by the almost instantaneous combustion of huge reserves of carbon as our society has developed,\" Craig Donlon, a European Space Agency project scientist, said before the first Sentinel-6 launch in 2020.",
      "\"We see evidence of this dramatic change in many different measurements ... but they all point the same direction: the Earth is warming. And the greatest indicator of this Earth system imbalance is sea level rise.\"",
      "The Sentinel-6 satellites are the result of a collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency, the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).",
      "St. Germain said NASA's share of the cost for both Sentinel-6 satellites came to about $500 million. The Europeans contributed a similar amount.",

    "story": [
      "Roblox, the popular online gaming platform that hosts millions of user-created games, said Tuesday it is strengthening protections for minors.",
      "Roblox said it will soon require players to use AI-powered facial age-estimation technology to help verify their age. The system, combined with ID-based age verification and confirmed parental consent, is intended to \"provide a more accurate measure of a user's age than simply relying on what someone types in when they create an account,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Roblox CEO David Baszucki described the guardrails in an interview with CBS Mornings' Tony Dokoupil as \"what we believe will become the gold standard for safety and civility on the internet.\"",
      "Doukopil questioned Baszucki about potential parental concerns about the AI verification, given that it involves minors sending pictures of themselves into the app to verify the user's age. Some parents \"are already skeptical about their children's safety on Roblox,\" Doukopil said.",
      "Roblox is \"not storing these images,\" Baszucki said. The photos \"are deleted soon after [Roblox] process[es] them.\"",
      "The image is used to determine the age of the Roblox user, and \"then to assign them to the right people that might connect with,\" he added.",
      "The company will start enforcing the age-check requirement in select global markets, including Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands, before expanding the system to other countries in early January. Roblox is also launching a dedicated online safety center to help families understand and set up the platform's parental controls.",
      "The company's enhanced protections arrive as dozens of families, along with attorneys general in Kentucky and Louisiana, are suing Roblox, Discord and other technology companies for allegedly failing to deter sexual predators from approaching children on their platforms. Florida is also investigating Roblox, with Attorney General James Uthmeier accusing the platform of failing to protect minors.",
      "Roblox in September outlined plans to expand age checks for all users who want to access communication features on the gaming platform. The guardrails are meant to limit communication between adults and minors unless they already know each other in the real world.",

    "summary": "The stock market has stumbled on concerns that the surge in artificial intelligence stocks could echo the dot-com bubble.",
    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence has fired the stock market to record highs this year, with companies eager to tout their AI prowess and investor darlings like AI chipmaker Nvidia soaring\u00a0on expectations of runaway growth.",
      "But a tinge of fear is starting to shadow that exuberance. Stocks have slumped this week as investors fret that the AI boom could go bust, with the S&P 500 on Nov. 18 dipping 0.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 1.1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite sinking 1.2%.",
      "The startling run-up in AI-related stocks is prompting comparisons to the dot-com era of the late 1990s, when many internet companies saw their stock prices skyrocket despite suffering vast financial losses. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, it took down former high-fliers like Pets.com, torched investor portfolios and triggered a recession.",
      "Bubbles occur when stocks surge on inflated growth expectations that ultimately prove to be disconnected from a company's underlying fundamentals, a painful reality check that typically ends with overhyped shares falling back to Earth.",
      "Beyond the stock market, economists are also questioning whether AI will turn out to be as transformative for businesses as proponents of the technology insist. Advocates say AI will spur a productivity boom, leading to stronger corporate growth and profitability.",
      "\"The stock market is a giant bet on AI right now. It's really 10 companies that are driving all of it,\" Rebecca Homkes, an economist and lecturer at the London Business School, told CBS News.",
      "In other words, this year's 15% gain in the S&P 500 \u00a0is largely due to a handful of tech giants that are heavily investing in AI. The combined market capitalization of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" \u2014 Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla \u2014 today represents a record 37% of the S&P 500's total value, according to Morningstar.",

      "That may give pause to the millions of Americans who are saving for retirement in 401(k) and other plans. If the market's gains lean so heavily on a few dominant companies, as during the dot-com bubble, the fallout could be severe if investors suddenly sour on AI.",
      "\"No one wants to be caught dancing after the music has stopped,\" Aaron Schaechterle, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said in an email.",
      "Still, today's stock valuations aren't nearly as stretched as they were in the late 1990s, Goldman Sachs analysts note. The investment bank's analysis of the Magnificent 7's median price-to-earnings ratio \u2014 a measure of a company's share price compared to its profits \u2014 found it is \"roughly half\" that of the largest seven companies in the late 1990s.",
      "\"So it is true that valuations are high but, in our view, generally not at levels that are as high as are typically seen at the height of a financial bubble,\" they noted.",
      "Why this time may be different",
      "The question of whether AI is fueling a bubble akin to the late 1990s was even posed to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.",
      "\"This is different in the sense that these companies \u2014 the companies that are so highly valued \u2014 actually have earnings and stuff like that,\" Powell said. \"So you go back to the '90s and the dot-com [period]... these were ideas rather than companies.\"",
      "Nvidia, for example, the AI boom's poster child, has seen its revenue more than double to $130 billion in its last fiscal year, while its profit surged 145%.",
      "Although the stock market may not be in imminent danger of a bubble-bursting crash, economists are increasingly questioning whether AI companies can live up to the hype, as well as justify the trillions in capital spending on the data centers and other infrastructure required to power the AI revolution.",
      "For these bets to pay off, AI will need to transform U.S. businesses by spurring a productivity boom that translates into stronger corporate growth and profitability, experts say.",
      "\"We want to understand whether this is storytelling or actual tangible gains,\" Homkes of the London Business School told CBS News.",
      "For tech evangelists like Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, the AI boom will lead to a \"4th industrial revolution\" that could supercharge economic growth. \"This is an AI Arms Race, and what is fueling this next chapter of growth is Big Tech spending and that is NOT slowing down into 2026,\" he wrote this week in a research note.",
      "\"The doubters need to come on board and recognize this is a transformational technology,\" Homkes agreed, while noting that such a shift is likely to take much longer than some AI boosters currently envision.",

    "story": [
      "Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp after a judge ruled that the company does not hold a monopoly in social networking.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued his ruling Tuesday after the historic antitrust trial wrapped up in late May. His decision follows two separate rulings that branded Google an illegal monopoly in both search and online advertising, dealing yet another regulatory blow to the tech industry that for years enjoyed nearly unbridled growth.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission \"continues to insist that Meta competes with the same old rivals it has for the last decade, that the company holds a monopoly among that small set, and that it maintained that monopoly through anticompetitive acquisitions,\" Boasberg wrote in his ruling. \"Whether or not Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, though, the agency must show that it continues to hold such power now. The Court's verdict today determines that the FTC has not done so.\"",
      "Meta Platforms Inc., the FTC had argued, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strategy, \"expressed in 2008: 'It is better to buy than compete.' True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.\"",
      "During his April testimony, Zuckerberg pushed back against the FTC's contention that Facebook bought Instagram to neutralize a threat. In his line of questioning, FTC attorney Daniel Matheson repeatedly brought up emails \u2014 many of them more than a decade old \u2014 written by Zuckerberg and his associates before and after the acquisition of Instagram.",
      "While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time didn't capture the full scope of his interest in the company. But the case was not about the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp more than a decade ago, which the FTC approved at the time, but about whether Meta holds a monopoly now. The FTC, Boasberg wrote in the ruling, could only win if it proved \"current or imminent legal violation.\"",
      "The FTC's complaint said Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and \"neutralize perceived competitive threats,\" just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers.",
      "Meta said Tuesday's decision \"recognizes that Meta faces fierce competition.\"",
      "\"Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth. We look forward to continuing to partner with the Administration and to invest in America,\" the Menlo Park, California-based company said in a statement.",
      "The social media landscape has changed so much since the FTC filed its lawsuit in 2020, Boasberg wrote, that each time the court examined Meta's apps and competition, they changed. Two opinions to dismiss the case \u2014 filed in 2021 and 2022 \u2014 didn't even mention popular social video platform TikTok. Today, it \"holds center stage as Meta's fiercest rival.\"",
      "Quoting the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, \"that no man can ever step into the same river twice,\" Boasberg said the same is true for the online world of social media as well.",
      "\"The landscape that existed only five years ago when the Federal Trade Commission brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly. While it once might have made sense to partition apps into separate markets of social networking and social media, that wall has since broken down,\" he wrote.",
      "Emarketer analyst Minda Smiley said Meta's win \"is not necessarily surprising considering the lengths it's gone to in recent years to keep up with TikTok.\"",
      "\"But from a regulatory standpoint, Meta is far from out of the woods: next year, major social networks will face landmark trials in the US regarding children's mental health,\" she added. \"Still, today's win is surely a boost for the company as it battles criticism and questions over how its massive AI spending will ultimately benefit Meta in the long run.\"",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following \u2014 in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal's value fell to $750 million after Facebook's stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012.",
      "Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller \"acqui-hires\" \u2014 a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",
      "WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp.",

    "story": [
      "Federal investigators released dramatic photos Thursday of an engine flying off a doomed UPS cargo plane that crashed two weeks ago, killing 14 people in Kentucky, and said there was evidence of cracks in the left wing's engine mount.",
      "The MD-11 plane only got 30 feet off the ground, the National Transportation Safety Board said, citing the flight data recorder in its first formal but preliminary report about the Nov. 4 disaster in Louisville, Kentucky.",
      "Three pilots on the plane were killed along with 11 more people on the ground near Muhammad Ali International Airport.",
      "The NTSB said the plane was not due yet for a detailed inspection of key engine mount parts that had fractures. It still needed to complete nearly 7,000 more takeoffs and landings. It was last examined in October 2021.",
      "\"It appears UPS was conducting this maintenance within the required time frame, but I'm sure the FAA is now going to ponder whether that time frame is adequate,\" aviation safety expert Jeff Guzzetti told The Associated Press after reading the report.",
      "A series of photos released by the NTSB show the left engine coming off the UPS plane and flying up and over the wing. The final image shows the plane slightly airborne with its left wing ablaze.",
      "Earlier this week, Bill Moore, president of UPS Airlines, an arm of UPS, said the company is working with investigators to determine the \"root cause\" of the crash.",
      "\"Once we determine that, then they'll be able to develop an inspection plan,\" Moore said at a news conference in Louisville. \"Can we inspect it? If so, how do we repair it? How do we put it back together? And then eventually return the fleet to service. But that's not going to happen quickly.\"",

    "story": [
      "A 1940 self-portrait by famed Mexican artist Frida Kahlo sold Thursday for $54.7 million at a New York art auction, becoming the top sale price for a work by any female artist.",
      "The painting of Kahlo asleep in a bed \u2014 titled \"El sue\u00f1o (La cama)\" or in English, \"The Dream (The Bed)\" \u2014 surpassed the record held by Georgia O'Keeffe's \"Jimson Weed/White Flower No. 1,\" which sold for $44.4 million in 2014.",
      "The sale at Sotheby's also topped Kahlo's own auction record for a work by a Latin American artist. The 1949 painting \"Diego and I,\" depicting the artist and her husband, muralist Diego Rivera, went for $34.9 million in 2021. Her paintings are reported to have sold privately for even more.",
      "Thursday's auction for the painting drew bids from two collectors over 5 minutes before selling \u2014 at more than 1,000 times the price it sold for 45 years ago, according to Sotheby's.",
      "\"When this painting sold at Sotheby's in 1980 for $51,000, few could have imagined it returning 45 years later to command $55 million. This record-breaking result shows just how far we have come, not only in our appreciation of Frida Kahlo's genius, but in the recognition of women artists at the very highest level of the market,\" Anna Di Stasi, head of Latin American art at Sotheby's, said in a news release. \"In El sue\u00f1o, Kahlo confronts her own fragility, yet what emerges is a portrait of extraordinary resilience and strength. It is an enduring testament to one of the most admired and sought-after artists of our time.\"",
      "The self-portrait is among the few Kahlo pieces that have remained in private hands outside Mexico, where her body of work has been declared an artistic monument. Her works in both public and private collections within the country cannot be sold abroad or destroyed.",
      "The painting comes from a private collection, whose owner has not been disclosed, and is legally eligible for international sale. Some art historians have scrutinized the sale for cultural reasons, while others have raised concern that the painting \u2014 last exhibited publicly in the late 1990s \u2014 could again disappear from public view after the auction. It has already been requested for upcoming exhibitions in cities including New York, London and Brussels.",
      "The buyer's identity was not disclosed.",
      "The piece depicts Kahlo asleep in a wooden, colonial-style bed that floats in the clouds. She is draped in a golden blanket and entangled in crawling vines and leaves. Above the bed lies a skeleton figure wrapped in dynamite.",
      "Kahlo vibrantly and unsparingly depicted herself and events from her life, which was upended by a bus accident at 18. She started to paint while bedridden, underwent a series of painful surgeries on her damaged spine and pelvis, then wore casts until her death in 1954 at age 47.",
      "During the years Kahlo was confined to her bed, she came to view it as a bridge between worlds as she explored her mortality.",
      "The painting was the star of a sale of more than 100 surrealist works by artists including Salvador Dal\u00ed, Ren\u00e9 Magritte, Max Ernst and Dorothea Tanning.",
      "Kahlo resisted being labeled a surrealist, a style of art that's dreamlike and centers on a fascination with the unconscious mind.",
      "\"I never painted dreams,\" she once said. \"I painted my own reality.\"",
      "In its catalog note, Sotheby's said the painting \"offers a spectral meditation on the porous boundary between sleep and death.\"",
      "\"The suspended skeleton is often interpreted as a visualization of her anxiety about dying in her sleep, a fear all too plausible for an artist whose daily existence was shaped by chronic pain and past trauma,\" the catalog notes.",

      "In 2001, she admitted to stealing checks from her employer while she was a teenager. She pleaded guilty and was ordered for removal in 2003. However, Vietnam would not accept her as they refused to take back immigrants who came to the U.S. before 1995. So, Tran was able to stay in the U.S. with the requirement that she complete regular immigration check-ins.",
      "According to her attorney, Tran has completed those check-ins for more than 20 years. However, during a check-in in Baltimore in May, she was detained.",

    "story": [
      "Grammy-winning rapper Prakazrel \"Pras\" Michel of the Fugees was sentenced on Thursday to 14 years in prison for a case in which he was convicted of illegally funneling millions of dollars in foreign contributions to former President Barack Obama's 2012 reelection campaign.",
      "Michel, 52, declined to address the court before U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly sentenced him.",
      "In April 2023, a federal jury convicted Michel of 10 counts, including conspiracy and acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government. The trial in Washington, D.C., included testimony from actor Leonardo DiCaprio and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.",
      "Justice Department prosecutors said federal sentencing guidelines recommended a life sentence for Michel, whom they said \"betrayed his country for money\" and \"lied unapologetically and unrelentingly to carry out his schemes.\"",
      "\"His sentence should reflect the breadth and depth of his crimes, his indifference to the risks to his country, and the magnitude of his greed,\" they wrote.",
      "Defense attorney Peter Zeidenberg said his client's 14-year sentence is \"completely disproportionate to the offense.\" Michel will appeal his conviction and sentence, according to his lawyer.",
      "Zeidenberg had recommended a three-year prison sentence. A life sentence would be an \"absurdly high\" punishment for Michel, given that it is typically reserved for deadly terrorists and drug cartel leaders, Michel's attorneys said in a court filing.",
      "\"The Government's position is one that would cause Inspector Javert to recoil and, if anything, simply illustrates just how easily the Guidelines can be manipulated to produce absurd results, and how poorly equipped they are, at least on this occasion, to determine a fair and just sentence,\" they wrote.",
      "Michel, a Brooklyn native whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from Haiti, was a founding member of the Fugees along with childhood friends Lauryn Hill and Wyclef Jean. Their hip-hop band won two Grammy Awards and sold tens of millions of albums.",
      "Michel obtained more than $120 million from Malaysian billionaire Low Taek Jho \u2014 also known as Jho Low \u2014 and steered some of that money through straw donors to Obama's campaign.",
      "Michel said during trial that he viewed Low's payments as \"free money,\" and accepted the millions over the course of nine months to help Low secure a photo op with Obama. He said under oath at the time that no one told him such payments toward political donations could have been unlawful or violations of campaign finance laws.",
      "The Justice Department also charged Michel with serving as an unregistered foreign agent for China, alleging that in 2017 he sought to sway the Trump administration to halt its probe into Low and to extradite a Chinese government target living in the U.S. That individual, dissident Miles Guo, was charged in New York in a billion-dollar fraud case and is still in custody.",
      "Low, who has lived in China, was one of the primary financiers of \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" a movie starring DiCaprio. Low is a fugitive but has maintained his innocence.",
      "\"Low's motivation for giving Mr. Michel money to donate was not so that he could achieve some policy objective. Instead, Low simply wanted to obtain a photograph with himself and then-President Obama,\" Michel's attorneys wrote.",
      "In August 2024, the judge rejected Michel's request for a new trial based in part on his defense attorney's use of a generative artificial intelligence program during his closing of the trial's arguments. The judges said that and other trial errors didn't amount to a serious miscarriage of justice.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration is proposing new oil drilling off the California and Florida coasts for the first time in decades, as President Trump seeks to expand U.S. oil production.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration announced new oil drilling off the California and Florida coasts for the first time in decades on Thursday, as President Trump seeks to expand U.S. oil production, advancing a project that critics say could harm coastal communities and ecosystems.",
      "The oil industry has been seeking access to new offshore areas, including off Southern California and Florida, as a way to boost U.S. energy security and jobs. The federal government has not allowed drilling in federal waters in the eastern Gulf, which includes offshore Florida and part of offshore Alabama, since 1995, because of concerns about oil spills. California has some offshore oil rigs, but there has been no new leasing in federal waters since the mid-1980s.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who is eyeing a 2028 presidential run and has emerged as a leading Trump critic, called the plan \"idiotic\" and \"reckless\" in a statement. The proposal is also likely to draw bipartisan opposition in Florida. Tourism and access to clean beaches are key parts of the economy in both states.",
      "The administration's plan proposes six offshore lease sales off the coast of California.",
      "It also calls for new drilling off the coast of Florida in areas at least 100 miles from that state's shore. The area targeted for leasing is adjacent to an area in the Central Gulf that already contains thousands of wells and hundreds of drilling platforms.",
      "The five-year plan also would compel more than 20 lease sales off the coast of Alaska, including a newly designated area known as the High Arctic, more than 200 miles offshore in the Arctic Ocean.",
      "CBS News reported earlier this month that the Trump administration was planning to hold offshore drilling auctions in several areas, including off the coasts of California, New England and the Carolinas. Plans viewed by CBS News called for lease sales off California as soon as 2027, and off Alaska as soon as next year.",
      "The energy industry has encouraged the Trump administration to expand offshore drilling. All offshore areas \"with the potential to generate jobs, new revenue and additional production to advance America's energy dominance should be considered for inclusion,\" the American Petroleum Institute and other groups said in a joint letter to the administration in June.",
      "Some Florida politicians have pushed back on offshore drilling plans. Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican and Trump ally, helped persuade Trump administration officials to drop a similar offshore plan in 2018 when he was governor. Earlier this month, Scott and fellow Florida Republican Sen. Ashley Moody co-sponsored a bill to maintain a moratorium on offshore drilling in the state, which Mr. Trump signed in his first term.",
      "\"As Floridians, we know how vital our beautiful beaches and coastal waters are to our state's economy, environment and way of life,\" Scott said in a Nov. 3\u00a0statement\u00a0announcing the bill. \"I will always work to keep Florida's shores pristine and protect our natural treasures for generations to come.\"",
      "Newsom said in a statement Thursday: \"Trump's idiotic plan endangers our coastal economy and communities and hurts the well-being of Californians. This reckless attempt to sell out our coastline to his Big Oil donors is dead in the water.\"",
      "California has been a leader in restricting offshore oil drilling since the infamous 1969 Santa Barbara spill that helped spark the modern environmental movement. While there have been no new federal leases offered since the mid-1980s, drilling from existing platforms continues.",
      "Newsom expressed support for greater offshore controls after a 2021 spill off Huntington Beach and has backed a congressional effort to ban new offshore drilling on the West Coast.",
      "\"For decades, California has stood firm in our opposition to new offshore drilling, and nothing will change that,\" the governor said in his statement Thursday.",
      "A Texas-based company, with support from the Trump administration, is seeking to restart production in waters off Santa Barbara, California, damaged by a 2015 oil spill. The administration has hailed the plan by Houston-based Sable Offshore Corp. as the kind of project Mr. Trump wants to increase U.S. energy production as the federal government removes regulatory barriers.",
      "Since taking office for a second time in January, Mr. Trump has reversed former President Joe Biden's focus on climate change to pursue what he calls U.S. \"energy dominance\" in the global market. The president created a National Energy Dominance Council and directed it to move quickly to drive up already record-high U.S. energy production, particularly fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas.",
      "Mr. Trump signed an executive order on the first day of his second term reversing Biden's ban on future offshore oil drilling on the East and West coasts. A federal court later struck down Biden's order to withdraw 625 million acres of federal waters from oil development.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump's administration has blocked renewable energy sources such as offshore wind and canceled billions of dollars in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects across the country.",
      "Democratic lawmakers, including California Sens. Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff and Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, warned that opening vast coastlines to new offshore drilling \"would devastate coastal economies, jeopardize our national security, ravage coastal ecosystems, and put millions of Americans' health and safety at risk.''",
      "Oil spills \"not only cause irreparable environmental damage, but also suppress the value of coastal homes, harm tourism economies and weaken coastal infrastructure,'' the lawmakers said in a letter signed by dozens of Democrats. One disastrous oil spill can cost taxpayers billions in lost revenue, cleanup costs and ecosystem restoration, they said.",
      "The League of Conservation Voters called Thursday's plan \"dangerous.\"",
      "\"This needless, reckless expansion of offshore drilling would jeopardize our coastal communities, public health, local economies, and the environment, while prolonging our dependence on fossil fuels and doing nothing to lower costs,\" America Fitzpatrick, the group's conservation program director, said in a statement.",

      "The Justice Department alleges that in 2021, a year before Cherfilus-McCormick was elected to Congress, a company that she ran\u00a0called Trinity Healthcare Services was overpaid $5 million on a Federal Emergency Management Agency-funded contract to assist with Florida's coronavirus vaccination campaign.",
      "The defendants in the case then allegedly \"conspired to steal\" the money by sending it through multiple bank accounts, the department said in a press release.",
      "Some of that overpaid money was used to help fund Cherfilus-McCormick's campaign to represent South Florida in the House, the Justice Department alleged. In particular, she was accused of funneling some of the money to friends and family members who donated it to her campaign in their own names, in what's known as a \"straw donor\" scheme.",
      "\"Using disaster relief funds for self-enrichment is a particularly selfish, cynical crime,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. \"No one is above the law, least of all powerful people who rob taxpayers for personal gain. We will follow the facts in this case and deliver justice.\"",
      "Cherfilus-McCormick was charged with theft of government funds, money laundering, making and receiving straw donor contributions and three conspiracy counts.",
      "She was also charged with conspiracy to make a false and fraudulent statement on a tax return. The indictment accuses her of submitting a return to the Internal Revenue Service that reported millions in false business expenses and charitable contributions.",
      "The congresswoman's brother, Edwin Cherfilus \u2014 who worked with her at the health care company \u2014 was also charged with money laundering and theft of government funds. Her congressional office's former chief of staff, Nadege Leblanc, was charged with straw donations, and her accountant, David Spencer, was charged with tax offenses.",
      "Cherfilus-McCormick has strongly denied the charges against her, calling them \"intimidation tactics\" in remarks to reporters Thursday afternoon.",
      "\"This is an unjust, baseless, sham indictment \u2014 and I am innocent,\" Cherfilus-McCormick said in a statement provided to CBS News early Thursday morning. \"The timing alone is curious and clearly meant to distract from far more pressing national issues. From day one, I have cooperated with every lawful request, and I will continue to do so until this matter is resolved. I am deeply grateful for the support of my district, and I remain confident that the truth will prevail. I look forward to my day in court. Until then, I will continue fighting for my constituents.\"",
      "Cherfilus-McCormick's legal team said in a statement the congresswoman \"is a committed public servant, who is dedicated to her constituents. We will fight to clear her good name.\"",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters late Wednesday that he would issue a statement on the criminal charges after speaking with Cherfilus-McCormick, but added: \"She's innocent until proven guilty.\"",
      "The congresswoman's company, Trinity Healthcare Services, was also sued by emergency officials in Florida earlier this year over an alleged multimillion-dollar overpayment.",
      "The Florida Department of Emergency Management said it contracted with Trinity to sign people up for COVID-19 vaccines. At one point, the company was accidentally paid more than $5 million rather than $50,000 due to a \"clerical error,\" and the company \"knowingly\" processed the invoice and refused to give the money back, the lawsuit says.",
      "In response, Trinity said in court papers that the state waited three years to inform the company about the overpayments. The company said it told the Florida Department of Emergency Management it was willing to discuss the dispute, but the agency didn't respond.",
      "The state dropped the case last year following mediation between the two parties.",
      "Cherfilus-McCormick has also faced a House Ethics Committee probe, after the\u00a0Office of Congressional Ethics\u00a0said last year she may have \"requested community project funding that would be directed to a for-profit entity.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 18:12:15 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal judge ruled Thursday that President Trump's months-long deployment of thousands of National Guard forces to the streets of Washington, D.C., violates federal law.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge ruled Thursday that President Trump's months-long deployment of thousands of National Guard forces to the streets of Washington, D.C., violates federal law.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb sided with D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, who sued the federal government over the Guard deployment, arguing it exceeded the president's legal authority. But the judge stayed her ruling for 21 days to give the Trump administration a chance to appeal it.",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson blasted the ruling, arguing that Mr. Trump has the authority to deploy Guard troops in the nation's capital. Jackson called Schwalb's lawsuit \"nothing more than another attempt \u2014 at the detriment of DC residents \u2014 to undermine the President's highly successful operations to stop violent crime in DC.\"",
      "In his own statement following the ruling, Schwalb said, \"Normalizing the use of military troops for domestic law enforcement sets a dangerous precedent, where the President can disregard states' independence and deploy troops wherever and whenever he wants \u2013 with no check on his military power. This unprecedented federal overreach is not normal, or legal. It is long past time to let the National Guard go home \u2013 to their everyday lives, their regular jobs, their families, and their children.\"",
      "Mr. Trump first ordered National Guard forces to D.C. in August, part of a broader crackdown on crime using a combination of Guard troops, federal law enforcement agents and local D.C. police who were briefly taken over by the federal government.",
      "Since then, Guard forces have been a common sight on the streets of the capital, especially in tourist-heavy areas, drawing pushback from some local officials. The deployment has been extended multiple times, and is currently set to run until at least February 2026.",
      "The president deployed the D.C. National Guard using his authority as commander in chief of the district's Guard forces \u2014 a unique arrangement as state-level Guard forces are usually controlled by governors. Several GOP-led states have also sent their own Guard troops to the city.",
      "In Thursday's ruling, Cobb said the president lacked the power to deploy the D.C. Guard for \"non-military, crime-deterrence missions in the absence of a request from the city's civil authorities.\" She said that, even though the president is the force's commander in chief, he doesn't have unlimited power to deploy the Guard as he sees fit.",
      "The federal government has argued the deployment is justified by a clause in D.C. local law that says the Guard's commanding general \"may order out any portion of the National Guard for such drills, inspections, parades, escort, or other duties\" \u2014 with the current deployment falling under the category of \"other duties.\" Cobb disputed that interpretation, writing that \"other duties\" appears to only cover military exercises.",
      "The Trump administration has also pointed to a local law that says the Guard can \"aid the civil authorities in the execution of the laws.\" But Cobb said that doesn't allow the government to \"unilaterally call upon the DCNG to assist the District with crime control,\" without a request from local officials.",
      "Separately, Cobb said federal law \"cannot support the out-of-state National Guards' operations in the District because there is no state-law basis for those Guards to travel to the District.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has dispatched National Guard forces to several other cities in recent months, often to protect federal agents and property during immigration crackdowns \u2014 drawing local pushback and mixed results in court.",
      "Members of the California National Guard were deployed to Los Angeles over the summer, despite opposition from Gov. Gavin Newsom. And hundreds of out-of-state National Guard forces were later sent to Chicago and Portland, Oregon, though many of those troops are set to return home, a Defense Department official confirmed to CBS News last weekend.",
      "The Trump administration has argued the deployments were justified because of tense protests against immigration agents, pointing to Title 10, a law that allows the Guard to be used when \"there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the government of the United States.\" Local officials have said the deployments are unnecessary and inappropriate, arguing that local police can handle the protests themselves.",
      "A panel of appeals court judges allowed Mr. Trump's Los Angeles deployment to go forward over the summer, following a lawsuit from Newsom, but a judge later found the troops had illegally engaged in civilian law enforcement. In Chicago and Portland, judges blocked\u00a0Guard forces from being deployed onto the streets, leaving them in a holding pattern for weeks.",

    "story": [
      "A federal immigration crackdown based in Charlotte, North Carolina's largest city, is now over, a local law enforcement agency said Thursday.",
      "The sheriff's office in Mecklenburg County, which includes Charlotte, said federal officials have confirmed with Sheriff Garry McFadden that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection operation known as \"\u00a0Charlotte's Web,\" has officially concluded. No border agent operations will occur on Thursday, a news release from the sheriff's office said.",
      "\"It is important to clarify that while the 'Charlotte's Web' operation has ended, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will continue to operate in Mecklenburg County as they always have,\" the news release said. \"ICE maintains full authority to detain, apprehend, and take into custody any undocumented immigrant in accordance with federal law.\"",
      "But Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin denied the operation has concluded, saying in a statement, \"The operation is not over and it is not ending anytime soon.\" A DHS spokesperson also touted the arrests of 370 people illegally in the U.S. in the last five days and said in a statement that the department and federal agencies \"continue to target some of the most dangerous criminal illegal aliens as Operation Charlotte's Web progresses.\"",
      "The operation that began in Charlotte over the weekend led to hundreds of arrests, according to authorities. It was part of President Trump's aggressive mass deportation efforts, which have sent the military and immigration agents into Democratic-run cities, from Chicago to Los Angeles.",
      "The push to carry out arrests in North Carolina expanded to areas around the state capital of Raleigh on Tuesday. Late Wednesday, Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell said on X that \"border patrol enforcement appears to have been suspended\" in the city.",
      "The number of arrests around Charlotte and beyond was about double the total announced by Homeland Security officials earlier this week. The department said in a statement that agencies \"continue to target some of the most dangerous criminal illegal aliens.\" Their targets include people living in the U.S. without legal permission and those who allegedly have criminal records.  Federal officials have offered few details about those arrested. They've also remained quiet about the scope of the enforcement operations across North Carolina and where agents will show up next, keeping communities on edge. The crackdown in Charlotte has been met with pockets of resistance and protests.",
      "Immigration officials have blanketed the country since January, pushing detention counts to all-time highs above 60,000. Big cities and small towns across the country are targeted daily amid higher-profile pushes in places such as Portland, Oregon, where more than 560 immigration arrests were made in October. Smaller bursts of enforcement have popped up elsewhere.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 16:57:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The bust, in the port outside of Peru's capital, Lima, led to the arrest of three men tied to a transnational criminal network involved in illegal fishing and wildlife smuggling, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. authorities have assisted the Peruvian government in seizing an estimated 10,000 individual shark fins destined for China \u2013 one of the largest wildlife trafficking operations in Latin American history.",
      "The bust, on Nov. 10 at an industrial port outside of Lima, led to the arrest of three men tied to a transnational criminal network involved in illegal fishing and wildlife smuggling, according to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.",
      "The cruelty behind the shark fin trade is well-documented. Shark finning often involves slicing fins off live sharks and discarding the mutilated animals back into the ocean, where they die from blood loss, suffocation or predation. The practice is banned in many countries but persists due to weak enforcement and high profits.",
      "Shark fins are prized in Chinese cuisine, particularly for shark fin soup, which is associated with status and celebration, according to the nonprofit Shark Stewards. It's a dish that can sell for $100 a bowl and continues to drive a lucrative black market.",
      "Despite growing awareness and some regulatory crackdowns, the global demand for shark fins remains strong. The United Nations estimates the illegal wildlife trade generates up to\u00a0$20 billion annually, rivaling the drug and arms trades in scale and sophistication.",
      "\"The billion-dollar fin and meat trade is driving the extinction of iconic shark and ray species. Now, more than ever, critical action must be taken before it's too late,\" Luke Warwick, director of Shark and Ray Conservation for the Wildlife Conservation Society, told CBS News.",
      "The operation was led by Peru's Organized Crime Investigation Division of the Environmental. The fins, valued at more than $11.2 million, were sourced from threatened species including blue sharks, pelagic thresher sharks and common thresher sharks.",
      "Authorities say the criminal network purchased fins from Ecuadorian fishermen and laundered them through falsified documents claiming the catch originated in Peruvian waters. Once dried and stored in Callao, Peru, outside Lima, the fins were prepared for export to China.",
      "\"The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in close partnership with the Peruvian National Police, is taking decisive action to dismantle the illegal shark fin trade. Together, we are committed to protecting sharks, and preserving the health of our oceans, for future generations,\" Doug Ault, deputy assistant director for law enforcement at the USFWS, told CBS News.",
      "Sharks play a critical role in maintaining healthy marine ecosystems. As apex predators, their decline can trigger cascading effects, including the collapse of coral reefs and fisheries. Many shark species reproduce slowly, making them especially vulnerable to overexploitation.",
      "While the bust marks a significant victory for law enforcement, it also highlights the scale of the challenge. The black market for wildlife products continues to thrive, driven by international demand, corruption and limited oversight, according to the\u00a0U.N.\u00a0For now, the 9.3 tons of fins seized in Peru represent a stark reminder of the global cost of environmental crime.",

      "The holiday shopping season is creating fresh openings for scammers looking to snag consumers' payment data, according to Visa's 2025 Holiday Threats Report.",
      "Artificial intelligence is also helping criminals move faster and reach more victims, according to Visa's scam disruption team. AI tools can generate authentic-sounding text for fake websites that look legitimate but are designed to steal your information.",
      "\"Just as regular consumers are excited for shopping season, scammers are also excited, because it gives them opportunities to capitalize on these feelings, and illicitly gather payment data, or other personal information from unsuspecting victims,\" Michael Jabbara, global head of fraud services at Visa, told CBS News.",
      "Here are five of the most common types of scams to watch for this holiday season, according to Visa.",
      "Fake retail websites",
      "Websites that appear authentic but have been constructed for the sole purpose of scamming customers are proliferating, according to Visa. These sites can closely mimic popular companies, duping shoppers into handing over credit card information.",
      "Sometimes they ship shoddy goods to customers, but in other cases, they don't bother sending anything.",
      "Jabbara said it can be difficult to distinguish between legitimate and copycat sites, and that it's wise to do extra research if your gut instinct says something is awry.",
      "\"Scammers do this for a living and are very good at it. You don't want to underestimate them,\" Jabbara said. \"If a consumer has a feeling that a deal is too good to be true, or a website looks fishy, do some validation.\"",
      "That can include looking at online reviews of the site or going directly to the business's site by typing in its URL, versus clicking on a social media site. For example, open a web browser and type in Gap.com, as opposed to clicking a link in a digital ad promoting T-shirts.",
      "Package delivery scams",
      "Scam artists are sending consumers texts claiming there is a \"delivery problem\" with an online order they probably didn't place. Criminals posing as package delivery services like UPS or FedEx tell consumers they must turn over their credit card information to receive a phony delivery.",
      "This type of scam proliferates around the holidays, when consumers make more online purchases and shippers deal with higher-than-normal volumes of packages, Visa notes.",
      "Criminals may sell and trade your personal information on the dark web, or enroll you in recurring billing cycles you never signed up for. Some consumers might not catch these issues if they don't pay close attention to their credit card statements, according to Visa.",
      "\"They input your payment information into a form and monetize it on different channels,\" Jabbara said.",
      "Jabbara advises that consumers never click on links from unknown senders.",
      "Paying for seasonal work",
      "Fake job offers also crop up during the holidays, when many Americans are trying to earn extra cash to cover gift-giving and travel. Scammers take advantage of that financial pressure.",
      "Visa advises job seekers to apply only through a company's official channels and to avoid any role that requires upfront payments.",
      "\"We see 'job offers' that tell workers they have to pay a fee to apply, or for a background check,\" Jabbara said. \"That is a surefire sign of a scam.\"",
      "Consumers should also verify that any company they're applying to is legitimate, he added.",
      "Travel-related fraud",
      "Scammers are also creating fake travel sites and sending phishing emails targeting people with holiday travel plans.",
      "Make sure to make reservations through trusted travel sites, and if a deal appears to be too good to be true, it probably is. Looking at reviews can help determine if a site is legitimate, Jabbara advises.",
      "Charity scams",
      "The year-end giving season also attracts scammers who exploit people's generosity by setting up phony charities.",
      "Fraudsters may build convincing websites or approach people in person with tap-to-donate schemes, Visa said. As with other scams, it's wise to confirm a charity's legitimacy before donating.",

    "story": [
      "Greenbelt, Md. \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday expressed frustration with the Trump administration over the testimony provided by a top immigration official who was called to address the steps the Trump administration has taken to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the West African country of Liberia.",
      "John Cant\u00fa, a senior official at Enforcement and Removal Operations at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, was the latest government witness to appear before U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis to answer questions about the potential removal of Abrego Garcia. But in each instance, Xinis has pushed back on the substance of the testimony.",
      "\"Today was a zero in my view,\" she said of Cant\u00fa's appearance.",
      "Abrego Garcia is challenging the Trump administration's efforts to remove him from the U.S. ahead of his criminal trial on human smuggling charges next year. Immigration authorities are now seeking to deport Abrego Garcia to Liberia, but an order from Xinis that's been in place since August prevents the government from removing him.",
      "Xinis did not rule on Abrego Garcia's bid for release but said she would move quickly to address his challenge.",
      "Cant\u00fa was summoned to testify after submitting a declaration to the court about a discussion between the State Department and the Costa Rican government about possibly accepting Abrego Garcia, as well as his potential deportation to Liberia. Abrego Garcia has designated Costa Rica as a country he is willing to be removed to, but the Trump administration has instead sought to deport him to a series of African countries.",
      "Cant\u00fa said that if the Trump administration had the green light to remove Abrego Garcia from the U.S., the government would schedule a commercial flight or charter a plane bound for Liberia. He said that the Liberian government provided assurances to the State Department that Abrego Garcia would not be persecuted, tortured or sent back to El Salvador.",
      "Asked about the declaration filed with the court, Cant\u00fa said he included in it information that was provided to him by the State Department.",
      "Xinis repeatedly expressed frustration with the quality of the testimony from Cant\u00fa and at least two other federal officials who have appeared before her to answer questions about the Trump administration's plans to deport Abrego Garcia.",
      "She said Cant\u00fa's answers were \"the worst of all.\"",
      "\"I've had three witnesses do this. This witness knew nothing. He didn't know the meaning of the words in his own affidavit,\" she said. \"That's extremely troubling.\"",
      "Xinis also questioned Justice Department lawyers as to whether a final order of removal had ever been issued for Abrego Garcia. A U.S. immigration judge in 2019 denied Abrego Garcia's bid for asylum but granted him a withholding of removal, which bars immigration authorities from deporting him to his home country of El Salvador.",
      "But Abrego Garcia's lawyers said they have not seen a final order of removal, which they said bolstered their argument for releasing him from immigration custody.",
      "Abrego Garcia's case has been a flashpoint in the Trump administration's immigration crackdown since the Salvadoran immigrant was removed from where he lived in Maryland to his native country in March. He was sent to El Salvador despite the immigration judge's 2019 decision.",
      "He faces deportation proceedings because he entered the U.S. illegally as a teenager in 2011.",
      "In June, Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. after he was detained in El Salvador's notorious mega-prison to face two felony charges of human smuggling. He has denied those charges.",
      "Ahead of Abrego Garcia's criminal trial that is scheduled to begin next year, the Trump administration has repeatedly sought to deport him from the U.S. again, proposing to send him to countries including Uganda, Eswatini and now, Liberia.",
      "The Trump administration is urging Xinis to lift her August order barring Abrego Garcia's deportation and allow the government to remove him to Liberia, arguing that the administration has gone through all the necessary steps to deport Abrego Garcia.",
      "The Justice Department said that Abrego Garcia, who remains in federal immigration detention, was interviewed in October by a U.S. government asylum officer, and that officer determined that he failed to prove he would face persecution or torture in Liberia. The Justice Department said any additional due process would be unwarranted.",
      "Abrego Garcia's \"claims are procedurally barred multiple times over and fail on the merits in any event,\" the Justice Department said in its filing. \"This Court should therefore dissolve its preliminary injunction and permit the government to remove Petitioner to Liberia.\"",
      "In addition, the Justice Department submitted declarations from U.S. officials stating that Liberia has made \"sufficient and credible\" assurances that Abrego Garcia would not be harmed there or removed from Liberia to another country where he potentially could be persecuted.",
      "In a press release late last month, Liberia's government said it had agreed to receive Abrego Garcia on \"a strictly humanitarian and temporary basis,\" following a U.S. request.",
      "Andrew Rossman, a lawyer for Abrego Garcia, raised concerns about the lack of detail surrounding how long he could remain in Liberia and what would happen once that clock ran out.",
      "\"Is Liberia going to send him to yet another unnamed country?\" he asked.",
      "Abrego Garcia and his legal team have repeatedly challenged the government's attempts to deport him to African nations, claiming fear of persecution or torture. They have also argued that the Trump administration's repeated efforts to send Abrego Garcia to Africa is a form of retaliation, and Abrego Garcia should instead be sent to Costa Rica.",
      "They noted the government had offered to send Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica this summer, but only if he pleaded guilty to the federal human smuggling charges he faces in Tennessee. The Costa Rican government initially said it was willing to accept Abrego Garcia after the conclusion of any criminal sentence he would serve, if convicted of the human smuggling charges.",
      "But Justice Department lawyers said earlier this month that the State Department had assessed that the Costa Rican government had reversed course and wouldn't take Abrego Garcia \"at this time without further negotiations\" and additional commitments from the U.S.",
      "Drew Ensign, a Justice Department lawyer, said that continuing negotiations with Costa Rica is \"not something that could easily be done.\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had also \"determined that it would be preferential in the interests of the United States,\" to send Abrego Garcia to an African country,\" Ensign said.",
      "\"It's so odd to me, it's so odd. And that's being polite,\" Xinis replied, citing the \"empty word salad\" declaration she got from Cant\u00fa and the Trump administration's lack of willingness to move forward with Costa Rica as the final deportation spot for Abrego Garcia.",

    "summary": "Sen. Lindsey Graham blocked a Democrat-led effort to approve a House-passed measure to repeal a controversial provision that allows senators to sue for $500,000 if federal investigators search their phone records without their knowledge.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, blocked a Democrat-led effort to approve a House-passed measure to repeal a controversial provision that allows senators to sue for $500,000 if federal investigators search their phone records without their knowledge.",
      "Sen. Martin Heinrich, a New Mexico Democrat, sought unanimous consent to approve the measure after the House unanimously passed the bill Wednesday, saying the provision many lawmakers are looking to repeal, which was tucked in last week's funding package, represents a country that \"is not serving the people.\"",
      "\"Last week Republicans in Congress passed a government funding bill that denies affordable health care to millions of Americans,\" Heinrich said. \"But what most people don't know is that they also voted to provide millions of dollars to a few Republican senators in a blatant, tax-funded cash grab.\"",
      "The new law requires service providers to notify senators if their phone records or other data are seized or subpoenaed, and senators are entitled to $500,000 for each violation. It also applies retroactively to 2022, allowing the senators whose phone records were seized during special counsel Jack Smith's investigation into the 2020 election to sue the federal government.",
      "But Graham, one of the senators whose phone records were subpoenaed, blocked the bill. Any single lawmaker has the power to block a bill's passage under unanimous consent rules.",
      "\"What did I do wrong?\" Graham said, refuting the idea that it was a lawful subpoena. \"What did I do to allow the government to seize my personal phone and my official phone when I was Senate Judiciary chairman?\"",
      "Graham deferred to Senate Majority Leader John Thune during his objection, asking him whether the provision had been socialized with Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, the committees of relevant jurisdiction and with the Ethics Committee. Thune said yes.",
      "\"So this wasn't Republicans doing this,\" Graham said. \"This was people in the Senate believing what happened to the Senate need never happen again.\"",
      "After outlining his plans to sue under the new law, the South Carolina Republican then gave the floor to Thune, who proposed to adjust the new law to \"address the question that has been raised about personal enrichment.\" He said with the change, any damages awarded under the law would be \"forfeited to the United States Treasury.\"",
      "\"This measure is about accountability and not profit,\" Thune said, requesting unanimous consent to make the change.",
      "Heinrich objected to Thune's request, saying: \"I think we should work with our colleagues in the House to address the underlying issue of protecting members without the outrageous damage provisions that were retroactively put into this statute.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-december-2025-rate-cut-probability-fomc-meeting-economy/",
    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 15:10:43 -0500",
    "summary": "The government's latest jobs data could affect whether Federal Reserve officials continue their push to ease borrowing costs.",
    "story": [
      "Just a few weeks ago, a December interest rate cut was viewed as practically a done deal by many economists. Now, with fresh government data showing solid U.S.\u00a0job growth in September, many forecasters think the Federal Reserve is likely to hold off lowering borrowing costs when policy makers meet next month.",
      "The probability of a Federal Reserve rate cut now stands at 22%, down from a likelihood of 97% as of mid-October, according to economists polled by financial data company FactSet. CME Fedwatch, a tool that forecasts rate cuts based on changes in the 30-Day Fed Funds futures prices, gives slightly better odds of a reduction, at about 41%.",
      "Translation: Wall Street economists and traders alike expect the Fed to leave rates unchanged at its next two-day meeting on Dec. 9-10. That would amount to a pause in the central bank's recent move to lower lending rates, coming after two consecutive cuts in September and October.",
      "The shift in expectations for future Fed rate cuts follows a six-week blackout in federal economic data because of the\u00a0government shutdown, a hiatus that hindered the central bank's ability to assess key economic trends. Last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that a December rate cut wasn't a \"foregone conclusion,\" pointing to signs that the job market remains on firm ground.",
      "The Fed is more likely to lower its benchmark federal funds rate \u2014 or what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 if officials conclude that the job market and broader economic growth are in danger of stalling. But Thursday's jobs data showed that employers continued to hire at a healthy clip in September.",
      "\"Given that today's numbers were not a bad as feared, in conjunction with hawkish statements from the Fed recently, it does appear that the Fed will skip a cut in December,\" Preston Caldwell, chief U.S. economist at Morningstar, said in an email.",
      "He added, \"But with the negative trend in labor markets remaining in place, we'd expect the Fed to resume cutting in their next meeting in January 2026, if they don't cut this December.\"",
      "The federal funds rate is currently sitting in a range of 3.75% to 4%.",
      "A move by the Fed to dial back rate cuts in 2026 could keep borrowing costs for homes and cars elevated. Pricier mortgages and auto loans are also reinforcing the feeling among many Americans, reflected in sentiment polls, that the cost of living remains too high.",
      "Mixed economic picture",
      "The Federal Reserve's so-called dual mandate requires monetary policymakers to keep both inflation and unemployment in check. The central bank cited the slowing labor market when it twice trimmed borrowing costs this fall.",
      "But the latest payroll gains released Thursday showed that employers hired 119,000 people in September \u2014 more than double what most economists had forecast. The nation's unemployment rate ticked up from 4.3% to 4.4%, the highest level since October of 2021. The increase in the jobless rate suggests more people are re-entering the workforce to search for a job, economists said.",
      "At the same time, inflation has edged up, climbing at an annual rate of 3% in September. That puts pressure on the Fed to keep price increases from spiraling higher, with some policymakers expressing concern over persistent inflation.",
      "The mixed economic picture is complicated by the absence of more recent official data. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said\u00a0this week that it will fold some October jobs data into its November report, which is set for release after the Fed's next meeting, on Dec. 16.",
      "\"September's payroll numbers may have surprised to the upside, but in terms of the Fed's December interest rate decision, October is what mattered,\" Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said in an email. \"With that data now delayed until after the FOMC meeting, the Fed's rate-cut path has more question marks.\"",
      "She added, \"Overall, the available economic data has supported a December cut, but given the Fed's cautious bent, it may choose to wait until it has more numbers in hand.\"",

      "Employers across the U.S. added 119,000 jobs in September, marking a pickup after previous employment data had shown a slowdown in hiring. The report marks the first official job tally since the\u00a0government shutdown ended last week, ending a six-week blackout on labor data.",
      "The numbers",
      "Economists had forecast payroll gains of 50,000 jobs in September, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "The unemployment rate rose 4.4% in September, up from 4.3% in August and the highest level since Oct. 2021. With robust job growth in September, that suggests more people are re-entering the workforce to search for a job, economists said.",
      "The Labor Department also revised job growth down for July and August by a combined 33,000, a sign that hiring during those months was weaker than previously reported.",
      "The health care sector saw the biggest boost in jobs, with 43,000 hires in September. The federal workforce, meanwhile, lost 3,000 jobs that month.",
      "Investment advisor firm Capital Economics estimates 150,000 federal workers will drop off the government's payroll in the fourth quarter this year, mainly due to the end of the Trump administration's deferred resignation programs.",
      "The job market has been losing momentum for much of this year, with previous employment reports indicating a slowdown in hiring. At the same time, employers have been announcing layoffs in recent months, leading to the worst October for job reductions in 22 years, according to\u00a0outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "Verizon said it would lay off 13,000 employees on Thursday. That follows major recent job cuts by\u00a0Target, Amazon, UPS\u00a0and other major companies.",
      "What it means",
      "The September employment figures suggest job growth remains firm amid concerns that the labor market was at risk of stalling.",
      "\"The September jobs report may be backward-looking, but offers reassurance that the labor market wasn't crumbling before the government shutdown,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics, said in a research note.",
      "Although job growth has weakened, \"it is not collapsing,\" added Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.",
      "The hiring numbers will shape Federal Reserve officials' decision on whether to cut interest rates at their next meeting in December. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at investment firm B. Riley Financial, thinks the odds of a rate cut have \"diminished significantly\" given there will not be a full October employment report and the November report won't be issued until after the Fed meets in December.",
      "Ashworth expects the Fed to delay its next rate cut until January. The probability of a rate cut now stands at 22%, according to economists polled by FactSet.",
      "Delayed employment reports",
      "The September jobs report, originally slated for Oct. 3, was pushed back by the government shutdown that ended on Nov. 12. The delay means it offers a belated snapshot of the labor market just before federal funding lapsed on Oct. 1.",
      "On Tuesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said it won't publish the full October employment report, which was originally slated for release on Nov. 7. Instead, the agency will fold select October data into the November report, which is set for release on Dec. 16.",

    "summary": "The Florida congressman has faced a number of controversies this year, ranging from alleged assault and harassment to stolen valor and federal contracting violations. He has denied any wrongdoing.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House blocked an effort to formally censure Republican Rep. Cory Mills of Florida and strip him of his committee assignments over allegations related to federal contracting violations, stolen valor and assault.",
      "GOP Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina introduced the censure resolution earlier Wednesday, citing troubling allegations against the congressman.",
      "She introduced the resolution as privileged, meaning GOP leadership had two legislative days to hold a floor vote on the measure. Mills successfully maneuvered to effectively kill the resolution by referring it to the House Ethics Committee.",
      "\"All the accusations and false things that are being said will be proven to be absolutely false in many ways,\" Mills said ahead of the vote. \"And I have the evidence and receipts.\"",
      "The vote came hours after the Ethics Committee announced it is investigating Mills for alleged campaign finance violations, sexual misconduct and other potential wrongdoing. Mace called the investigation \"a naked attempt to kill my resolution.\"",
      "Mills has faced a number of controversies this year, including allegations that he threatened to release nude photos of a former girlfriend, which prompted a judge to grant a protective order in October. The censure resolution also cites reports that Mills was investigated for potential domestic violence in February. Mills has denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged with a crime.",
      "\"Cory Mills' alleged conduct makes him unfit to serve on any committee responsible for our national security,\" Mace said in a statement.",
      "\"I will not stand by while women risk everything to come forward with credible allegations of abuse and threats. I will not stay silent while a Member of Congress may be lining his pockets through federal contracts. And I will not look the other way while allegations of stolen valor, a slap in the face to every veteran who earned their service and sacrifice, goes unchecked,\" she said.",
      "The financial allegations revolve around a report by a congressional watchdog in August 2024 that found Mills may have misrepresented information on his campaign finance disclosure forms and may have \"entered into, held, or enjoyed contracts with federal agencies while he was a Member of Congress in violation of House rules, standards of conduct, and federal law.\"",
      "Mace's resolution also stated that \"individuals who served in the military with Representative Cory Mills have called into question the veracity of the account of events which formed the basis of a recommendation that ... Mills receive an award of a Bronze Star, bestowed in 2021, for his service under enemy fire in Iraq in 2003.\"",
      "In a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson earlier Wednesday, Mace expressed \"grave concern regarding the fitness\" of Mills and urged the Louisiana Republican to take action to remove him from his committee assignments. Mills serves on the Armed Services Committee and the Foreign Affairs Committee.",
      "Mace's effort followed attempts from Democrats to formally rebuke him in retaliation for censure measures that GOP members brought against Democrats for their conduct.",
      "Democrats threatened to force a vote on another censure measure against Mills on Tuesday if Republicans had succeeded in censuring Del. Stacey Plaskett, a Democrat from the Virgin Islands. The push to punish Plaskett came after revelations that she was texting convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein during a House Oversight Committee hearing in 2019. The messages were released last week by the House Oversight Committee, which has made tens of thousands of documents public as part of its investigation into the Epstein case.",

      "The newly released material from 2017 shows a series of text messages between Epstein and an apparent adviser to Gates, discussing the tech baron and other attendees at an annual banquet in Washington.",
      "Epstein had been hoping to sell Gates on a donor-advised fund, a tax-deductible charitable vehicle Epstein wanted to operate, but that never ultimately materialized.",
      "Gates was interested in the idea, the adviser said, but for the misgivings of one person who didn't want him communicating with Epstein: Gates' then-wife Melinda.",
      "\"He wants to talk to you but his wife won't let him,\" the adviser said. In a series of texts a minute later, the adviser said of Gates, \"he loves you,\" \"he says hi,\" and \"he feels bad about the [donor advised fund] btw He thought great idea but wife wouldn't allow.\"",
      "Later in the day, Epstein suggested to the same person that former Obama White House counsel Kathryn Ruemmler \"would love to sit with Melinda and give her the other side of Jeffrey.\" A source tells CBS News that meeting never took place.",
      "CBS News previously reported that Ruemmler, who is currently the chief legal officer at Goldman Sachs, was among Epstein's inner circle in the final years of his life. Ruemmler has described it as a business relationship; she is not accused of wrongdoing.",
      "Requests for comment sent to Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates were not immediately returned. The couple divorced in 2021 after 27 years of marriage.",
      "A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs declined to comment Wednesday. In October, they told CBS News that Ruemmler's relationship with Epstein was related to her work for her previous employer, the law firm Latham & Watkins.",
      "The Microsoft founder and philanthropist has previously sought to minimize his connection to Epstein, saying in 2019, \"I didn't have any business relationship or friendship with him.\" In 2021, after it became clear that Gates and Epstein had met repeatedly in the decade before Epstein's 2019 death, Gates called spending time with Epstein a \"huge mistake.\"",
      "Epstein's appointment calendar, released by Congress in September, shows several meetings with Gates, who previously said he had met with Epstein while seeking contributions and connections for his global health philanthropy.",
      "Gates is among a slew of famous and powerful people who have long sought to publicly downplay their connections to Jeffrey Epstein. In some cases, documents have come to light showing they in fact had more involved relationships than they've acknowledged.",
      "Epstein was a prolific networker who sought to build relationships with world leaders, business titans and celebrities, often casting himself as a middleman who could connect the powerful.",
      "His ability to build an elite social circle continued even after he had become a registered sex offender,\u00a0 following a 2008 deal with prosecutors in Florida that allowed Epstein to plead guilty to lesser state charges. He then was able to return to his globetrotting life.",
      "As cache after cache of Epstein's personal communications, flight logs and calendars have come out, many of his friends and acquaintances have faced blowback. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said Wednesday he is resigning from the board of OpenAI and leaving a number of other roles following newly surfaced communications between him and Epstein.",

      "\"I feel hopeful not because I have a lot of trust in the political process, but because of what I've seen, what is possible when people come together and demand something and pressure is placed by the American people here,\" she said. \"I appreciate everyone who spoke out about this.\"",
      "But she admitted she still has concerns about getting full transparency.",
      "Farmer's sister, Maria, who is also a survivor of Epstein's abuse and was one of the first in 1996 to report it to law enforcement, has made Freedom of Information Act requests for documents related to investigations of Epstein over the years.",
      "\"The things that have been released have been heavily redacted and, therefore, you know, really not very helpful,\" Farmer said.",
      "Earlier this month, Mr. Trump asked the Department of Justice to investigate Epstein's ties to prominent Democrats, even though the FBI said over the summer that they had conducted an \"exhaustive review\" of Epstein-related materials and \"did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\"",
      "\"So these files should be available now. They should not be tied up in any kind of investigation,\" she said. \"But we're concerned about things like that, that might get in the way of what we're looking for.\"",
      "Maxwell's sentence",
      "Farmer testified at Maxwell's trial in 2021. A key accuser in the trial, Farmer said that she went to Epstein's New Mexico ranch in 1996 hoping he and Maxwell would help with academic endeavors. Farmer told jurors at the trial that Maxwell allegedly massaged her breasts and Epstein climbed into bed with her without her permission.",
      "Earlier this month, CBS News reported Maxwell planned to ask Mr. Trump to commute her sentence, according to documents obtained by Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee.",
      "\"She needs to serve her full sentence,\" Farmer said about Maxwell, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022 for her role in the Epstein sex abuse case.",
      "\"She harmed so many more than just individuals that were involved in the trial and so I think to now see her getting this special treatment and potentially be receiving some kind of pardon, it's really unfathomable,\" Farmer said.",
      "In a letter from Democrats to Mr. Trump, which was seen by CBS News, the lawmakers alleged Maxwell was receiving preferential treatment.",
      "\"Federal law enforcement staff working at the camp have been waiting on Ms. Maxwell hand and foot,\" says the letter signed by Rep. Jamie Raskin, the ranking Democrat on the committee.",
      "\"I think it's absolutely disgusting that she's getting this preferential treatment,\" Farmer said.",

Parasocial is defined as \"involving or relating to a connection that someone feels between themselves and a famous person they do not know, a character in a book, film, TV series, etc., or an artificial intelligence.\"",

      "\"We've entered an age where many people form unhealthy and intense parasocial relationships with influencers,\" Schnall said. \"This leads to a sense that people 'know' those they form parasocial bonds with, can trust them and even to extreme forms of loyalty. Yet it's completely one sided.\"",
      "The trend is also evolving to include artificial intelligence.",
      "\"Parasocial trends take on a new dimension as many people treat AI tools like ChatGPT as 'friends,' offering positive affirmations, or as a proxy for therapy. This is an illusion of a relationship and group think, and we know young people can be susceptible for this,\" Schnall said.",

      "The ship has been the subject of a legal battle in the United States, Colombia and Spain over who owns the rights to the sunken treasure.",
      "Colombia is in arbitration litigation with Sea Search Armada, a group of U.S. investors, for the economic rights of the San Jos\u00e9. The firm claims $10 billion corresponding to what they assume is worth 50% of the galleon treasure that they claim to have discovered in 1982.",

The coins feature depictions of castles, lions and crosses on the front and the \"Crowned Pillars of Hercules\" above ocean waves on the back, according to a new study published in the journal\u00a0Antiquity.",
      "In 2024, Colombian authorities said one remotely operated vehicle surveyed the wreck, uncovering\u00a0numerous artifacts, including an anchor, jugs and glass bottles.",
      "The Colombian government announced last year it would begin extractions from the ship off its Caribbean coast, using multiple remotely operated vehicles. The ship's exact location has been kept secret to protect the storied wreck from potential treasure hunters.",
      "Since its discovery, multiple parties have laid claim to the shipwreck, including Colombia, Spain and Indigenous Qhara Qhara Bolivians who claim the treasures on board were stolen from them. The wreck has also been claimed by U.S.-based salvage company Sea Search Armada, which says it first discovered the wreck more than 40 years ago.",
      "The cause of the San Jose's sinking has also been debated. British documents indicate that the ship did not explode,\u00a0according to Colombia's government, but Spanish reports suggest the ship was blown up in battle.",
      "Either way, the ship \u2014 laden with chests of emeralds and about 200 tons of gold \u2014 sank with most of its crew while heading back from the New World to Spain on June 7, 1708.",
      "In May 2024, Colombia\u00a0declared the site\u00a0of the shipwreck a \"protected archeological area.\"",

    "summary": "A 1940 self-portrait by Frida Kahlo has sold for $54.7 million and made auction history at Sotheby's in New York.",
    "story": [
      "A 1940 self-portrait by famed Mexican artist Frida Kahlo sold Thursday for $54.7 million at a New York art auction, becoming the top sale price for a work by any female artist.",
      "The painting of Kahlo asleep in a bed \u2014 titled \"El sue\u00f1o (La cama)\" or in English, \"The Dream (The Bed)\" \u2014 surpassed the record held by Georgia O'Keeffe's \"Jimson Weed/White Flower No. 1,\" which sold for $44.4 million in 2014.",
      "The sale at Sotheby's also topped Kahlo's own auction record for a work by a Latin American artist. The 1949 painting \"Diego and I,\" depicting the artist and her husband, muralist Diego Rivera, went for $34.9 million in 2021. Her paintings are reported to have sold privately for even more.",
      "Thursday's auction for the painting drew bids from two collectors over 5 minutes before selling \u2014 at more than 1,000 times the price it sold for 45 years ago, according to Sotheby's.",
      "\"When this painting sold at Sotheby's in 1980 for $51,000, few could have imagined it returning 45 years later to command $55 million. This record-breaking result shows just how far we have come, not only in our appreciation of Frida Kahlo's genius, but in the recognition of women artists at the very highest level of the market,\" Anna Di Stasi, head of Latin American art at Sotheby's, said in a news release. \"In El sue\u00f1o, Kahlo confronts her own fragility, yet what emerges is a portrait of extraordinary resilience and strength. It is an enduring testament to one of the most admired and sought-after artists of our time.\"",
      "The self-portrait is among the few Kahlo pieces that have remained in private hands outside Mexico, where her body of work has been declared an artistic monument. Her works in both public and private collections within the country cannot be sold abroad or destroyed.",
      "The painting comes from a private collection, whose owner has not been disclosed, and is legally eligible for international sale. Some art historians have scrutinized the sale for cultural reasons, while others have raised concern that the painting \u2014 last exhibited publicly in the late 1990s \u2014 could again disappear from public view after the auction. It has already been requested for upcoming exhibitions in cities including New York, London and Brussels.",
      "The buyer's identity was not disclosed.",
      "The piece depicts Kahlo asleep in a wooden, colonial-style bed that floats in the clouds. She is draped in a golden blanket and entangled in crawling vines and leaves. Above the bed lies a skeleton figure wrapped in dynamite.",
      "Kahlo vibrantly and unsparingly depicted herself and events from her life, which was upended by a bus accident at 18. She started to paint while bedridden, underwent a series of painful surgeries on her damaged spine and pelvis, then wore casts until her death in 1954 at age 47.",
      "During the years Kahlo was confined to her bed, she came to view it as a bridge between worlds as she explored her mortality.",
      "The painting was the star of a sale of more than 100 surrealist works by artists including Salvador Dal\u00ed, Ren\u00e9 Magritte, Max Ernst and Dorothea Tanning.",
      "Kahlo resisted being labeled a surrealist, a style of art that's dreamlike and centers on a fascination with the unconscious mind.",
      "\"I never painted dreams,\" she once said. \"I painted my own reality.\"",
      "In its catalog note, Sotheby's said the painting \"offers a spectral meditation on the porous boundary between sleep and death.\"",
      "\"The suspended skeleton is often interpreted as a visualization of her anxiety about dying in her sleep, a fear all too plausible for an artist whose daily existence was shaped by chronic pain and past trauma,\" the catalog notes.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 19:14:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Kyiv said it plans to \"work on points of the plan.\" it received from the U.S. that's aimed at restarting diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has received a draft plan aimed at ending the war in Ukraine, his office confirmed Thursday.",
      "It said in a statement that he had \"officially received a draft plan from the American side, which, according to the American side, could activate diplomacy.\" The statement went on to say \"it was agreed to work on the points of the plan in such a way as to bring the war to a dignified end.\"",
      "A senior White House official confirmed to CBS News on Thursday that President Trump was backing a 28-point plan drafted by envoy Steve Witkoff and an adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war Russia started nearly four years ago with its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but it's not clear whether this plan is the one that Zelenskyy received.",
      "The plan, according to reports by Axios, the Financial Times and the New York Times, calls for Ukraine to abandon territory, give up some weapons and shrink its army, and while President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday that the war must end, he reiterated that from Kyiv's perspective, \"there can be no reward for waging war.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's endorsement of the plan was first reported by NBC.",
      "Previously, Ukraine has agreed with the U.S. to a freezing of the battle lines where they stand as a starting point for negotiations, while also making clear that it needs security guarantees from Washington and its Western partners.",
      "Axios, citing a U.S. official, reported Monday that Witkoff was drafting a 28-point peace plan and had \"discussed it extensively\" with Kirill Dmitriev, an adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Dmitriev said in an interview with Axios that he met with Witkoff and other Trump officials for three days in Miami in late October. He expressed optimism about the proposal, saying, \"We feel the Russian position is really being heard.\"",
      "Just days after the Trump administration imposed sanctions on Russian oil and gas in October, Dmitriev traveled to the U.S. to hold previously scheduled talks with Witkoff in an effort to continue to make progress on a proposal to end the war, as a senior U.S. official described it at the time.",
      "Dmitriev is under U.S. sanctions, which had to be waived for him to travel to Florida to meet with Witkoff.",
      "The White House official who spoke with CBS News on Thursday said Witkoff had been working on a proposal quietly for about a month, and said that he consulted with both the Russians and Ukrainians to take their feedback into account. The extent of those consultations with Ukraine was not clear from Kyiv's statement Thursday, but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters the same day that Witkoff and Rubio \"met with some of the Ukrainians just in the past week to discuss this very plan.\"",
      "Senior Ukrainian official Rustem Umerov was verbally briefed in Miami this week by Witkoff, a source familiar with the conversation told CBS News.",
      "Top European Union official Kaja Kallas, when asked Thursday if Europeans were involved in the process, responded, \"Not that I know of.\" She also reiterated a point that's consistently been made by Ukraine and its supporters that \"for any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans on board.\"",
      "Witkoff and Dmitriev have been talking for weeks about a proposal to end the war, gaming out ideas even as Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury chief Scott Bessent criticized Russia, saying Moscow was not serious about ending the war.",
      "\"Ending a complex and deadly war such as the one in Ukraine requires an extensive exchange of serious and realistic ideas,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on X Wednesday. \"And achieving a durable peace will require both sides to agree to difficult but necessary concessions. That is why we are and will continue to develop a list of potential ideas for ending this war based on input from both sides of this conflict.\"",
      "White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller told CBS News Wednesday that he didn't have any announcements to share about a peace plan, but said it was an issue \"the president has continued to put at the forefront of our foreign policy goal.\"",
      "The recent U.S. sanctions appear to be taking a toll on Russia \u2014 a Treasury Department analysis Thursday indicates that the oil sanctions have sent prices there tumbling, choking off a key revenue source that Russia has used to fund its war in Ukraine. The U.S. gas sanctions against Russia go into effect Friday.",
      "Amid the U.S. diplomatic efforts \u2014 which include a visit to Kyiv this week by a delegation led by the U.S. Army secretary \u2014 Russian missiles have continued to pummel Ukraine.",
      "Rescuers were still searching on Thursday for victims of a devastating Russian strike on an apartment building in the western city of Ternopil that killed at least 26 people, including three children, according to Ukrainian authorities.",
      "Shrieking Russian missiles slammed into the building on Wednesday, burning at least 19 people to death in the apartments.",
      "The strike landed just as the Army secretary Dan Driscoll arrived in the Ukrainian capital, one day after the U.S. greenlit a $100 million package to upgrade Ukraine's Patriot missile-interceptor systems.",
      "Kathryn  Watson and \n                                                  \n                                  Richard  Escobedo\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 16:57:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The bust, in the port outside of Peru's capital, Lima, led to the arrest of three men tied to a transnational criminal network involved in illegal fishing and wildlife smuggling, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. authorities have assisted the Peruvian government in seizing an estimated 10,000 individual shark fins destined for China \u2013 one of the largest wildlife trafficking operations in Latin American history.",
      "The bust, on Nov. 10 at an industrial port outside of Lima, led to the arrest of three men tied to a transnational criminal network involved in illegal fishing and wildlife smuggling, according to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.",
      "The cruelty behind the shark fin trade is well-documented. Shark finning often involves slicing fins off live sharks and discarding the mutilated animals back into the ocean, where they die from blood loss, suffocation or predation. The practice is banned in many countries but persists due to weak enforcement and high profits.",
      "Shark fins are prized in Chinese cuisine, particularly for shark fin soup, which is associated with status and celebration, according to the nonprofit Shark Stewards. It's a dish that can sell for $100 a bowl and continues to drive a lucrative black market.",
      "Despite growing awareness and some regulatory crackdowns, the global demand for shark fins remains strong. The United Nations estimates the illegal wildlife trade generates up to\u00a0$20 billion annually, rivaling the drug and arms trades in scale and sophistication.",
      "\"The billion-dollar fin and meat trade is driving the extinction of iconic shark and ray species. Now, more than ever, critical action must be taken before it's too late,\" Luke Warwick, director of Shark and Ray Conservation for the Wildlife Conservation Society, told CBS News.",
      "The operation was led by Peru's Organized Crime Investigation Division of the Environmental. The fins, valued at more than $11.2 million, were sourced from threatened species including blue sharks, pelagic thresher sharks and common thresher sharks.",
      "Authorities say the criminal network purchased fins from Ecuadorian fishermen and laundered them through falsified documents claiming the catch originated in Peruvian waters. Once dried and stored in Callao, Peru, outside Lima, the fins were prepared for export to China.",
      "\"The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in close partnership with the Peruvian National Police, is taking decisive action to dismantle the illegal shark fin trade. Together, we are committed to protecting sharks, and preserving the health of our oceans, for future generations,\" Doug Ault, deputy assistant director for law enforcement at the USFWS, told CBS News.",
      "Sharks play a critical role in maintaining healthy marine ecosystems. As apex predators, their decline can trigger cascading effects, including the collapse of coral reefs and fisheries. Many shark species reproduce slowly, making them especially vulnerable to overexploitation.",
      "While the bust marks a significant victory for law enforcement, it also highlights the scale of the challenge. The black market for wildlife products continues to thrive, driven by international demand, corruption and limited oversight, according to the\u00a0U.N.\u00a0For now, the 9.3 tons of fins seized in Peru represent a stark reminder of the global cost of environmental crime.",

      "But our reliance on these undersea cables is a vulnerability, and one that rogue actors have allegedly already tried to exploit, including some adversaries of the United States.",
      "Russia has been accused recently by America's NATO allies of increasing \"hybrid warfare\" against Europe, and analysts say it has shown a clear interest in targeting things like undersea infrastructure.",
      "\"That's quite explicitly a part of Russian thinking regarding modern warfare,\" said Sidharth Kaushal, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a British military think tank, in an interview with CBS News earlier this year.",
      "He said that sabotaging \"critical nodes on which society functions\u2026 [has been] illustrated in real time in the last few years.\"",

      "\"The sabotage events, they are a new phenomenon,\" Gabrielius Landsbergis, the former foreign minister of Lithuania, told CBS News. \"They are directly associated with this later stage of Russia's militarization and aggressive action \u2014 not just against Ukraine, but also against the West.\"",

      "Relatively few undersea cables connect some of the Baltic NATO members, such as Lithuania, to the rest of Europe and the wider world.",
      "\"Baltic states are, you know, not entirely an island, but pretty much so,\" Landsbergis told CBS News. \"That means that for us [Baltic states] to connect to the Western infrastructure, it's a rather difficult task. So most of our connections, a big part of our connections, go through the Baltic Sea.\"",
      "The Baltic Sea is relatively shallow, meaning ships only need to drag their anchors along the bottom to cause potentially serious damage to cables. That increases the possibility of accidental damage, but also lends plausible deniability to malign actors who would like to carry out sabotage operations there.",
      "And Russia's \"shadow fleet\" of vessels, with hazy registration and insurance documentation that allows it to continue transporting oil and other energy products around the world despite Western sanctions imposed over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, has increased its plausible deniability.",
      "When Finland and Sweden joined NATO, many in the West hoped the Baltic Sea would effectively become a \"NATO lake.\" Over the last few years, there have been several incidents of alleged Russian sabotage of underwater cables in the sea.",
      "\"It is clearly a spike,\" Landsbergis told CBS News. \"We have never seen almost any incidents during the last, I don't know, 20 years, and suddenly after [Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine] started, they're basically recurring every month.\"",
      "Targeting the \"anthropogenic shell of modern society\"",
      "RUSI's Kaushal said the apparent sabotage operations in the Baltic are an example of the hybrid warfare tactics being increasingly adopted by U.S. adversaries.",
      "\"Ever since the 90's and early 2000's, the Russians have talked about how the so-called anthropogenic shell of modern society \u2014 basically the fragile infrastructure on which it depends \u2014 is its Achilles heel,\" he told CBS News earlier this year. \"Attacks on undersea cables are one major part of that, along with missile attacks (like on infrastructure in Ukraine) and cyberattacks.\"",
      "Landsbergis told CBS News that he believes Russia's objective in disrupting undersea cables is to intimidate local populations, as well as to \"test the reactions \u2014 you know, how do politicians react? How do militaries react? Whether there is a response or not.\"",
      "With the Trump administration pushing hard for its European NATO allies to rely less on the U.S. for their security, \"it's not the question about how we see NATO, but it's the question how Putin sees NATO,\" Landsbergis told CBS News.",
      "He said without a firm, unified response to the sabotage, Putin could determine \"NATO is not the alliance that it has been before Trump,\" and that could lead the Russian autocrat to \"say, OK, maybe this is the time that I intend to test it.\"",
      "What is NATO doing about it?",
      "At the start of this year, NATO launched \"Baltic Sentry,\" a new operation \"to strengthen the protection of critical infrastructure.\"",
      "\"By working together with all Allies, we will do what it takes to ensure the safety and security not only of our critical infrastructure but of all that we hold dear,\" NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said in a statement announcing Baltic Sentry in January.",
      "The operation involves maritime patrols, aircraft and naval drones, as well as national surveillance assets, according to NATO. The Alliance said it would also work with industry to improve the resilience of undersea cables.",
      "Sweden, another country that shares a Baltic coastline with Russia, broke with its centuries-old policy of military non-alignment and became NATO's newest member last year, in direct response to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.",
      "It staged military exercises earlier this month to practice countering covert espionage and sabotage missions carried out by adversaries in the Baltic Sea.",
      "\"We're not at peace, but not at war,\" Swedish submarine flotilla Commander Paula Wallenburg told CBS News during the exercise.",
      "Wallenburg said the current circumstances look \"pretty close to\" those seen during the Cold War, when the nuclear-armed U.S. and then-Soviet Union tested each other's resolve in a face off that never quite turned into a full-scale military conflict.",
      "\"It's a very serious situation when it comes to security here in this area,\" she said.",
      "Below is a look at some recent incidents in the Baltic Sea in which Russia-linked vessels have been alleged to have been involved in damaging, or seen loitering around, undersea cables.",
      "Case study: Eagle S",
      "On Christmas Day 2024, an electricity cable and four telecommunications cables linking Finland and Estonia suffered unplanned outages, reducing the two countries' interconnectivity. Finland's National Bureau of Investigation later discovered a 60-mile drag mark near the Estlink 2 cable.",
      "The Eagle S, a crude oil tanker sailing under the flag of the Cook Islands and officially registered to a UAE company, left Russia's Baltic port of Ust-Luga on the morning of the outages, with its destination listed as Turkey, according to ship tracking data from MarineTraffic.",
      "The ship sailed over one of the Estlink submarine cables in the Gulf of Finland around the time a power failure was reported by the country's electric grid operators.",
      "The ship's anchor was later discovered near the point where the drag mark ended.",
      "Finnish border guards detained the ship and its crew, led by a Georgian national.",
      "The Eagle S was released to international waters in March, but Finland pursued criminal charges against the crew. The case was dismissed in October, when the court ruled prosecutors had failed to prove intent, but prosecutors said they would appeal.",
      "Case study: Two Russian trawlers tracked in area when Svalbard cable cut",
      "In February 2022, Norwegian police told local media they believed \"human impact\" was to blame for damage to one of a pair of undersea telecommunications cables connecting the country's mainland with its northern archipelago of Svalbard a month earlier.",
      "Space Norway, which operates the Svalbard Undersea Cable System, told CBS News the two cables \u2014 which were laid as a redundant pair in the event one suffered damage \u2014 are the world's northernmost subsea cable systems.",
      "Space Norway said it detected an outage in the Greenland Sea on Jan, 7.",
      "The damage occurred in an area where the cables descend steeply from a depth of 980 feet to nearly 9,000 feet, the operator told CBS News.",
      "Generally, the cables are buried approximately six feet deep, although there may be variations due to the nature of the seabed, the state-owned company explained, while declining to go into detail about the seabed conditions where the damaged cables were buried.",
      "There was never a loss of service for users in Svalbard, a Space Norway spokesperson said, and the investigation into the cut was eventually closed due to a lack of evidence.",
      "But a report from Norway's public broadcaster NRK and open-source information showed Russian fishing trawlers made more than a dozen passes over the area before the damage occurred.",
      "Other evidence of \"hybrid warfare\"",
      "This week, Poland's top diplomat accused Russia of carrying out an \"act of state terror\" by blowing up a railway line over the weekend.",
      "\"It was an act of not only subversion, as happened before, but an act of state terror as its clear intention was to cause human casualties,\" Polish foreign minister Radek Sikorski said.",
      "Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk said two Ukrainian citizens believed to have been working with Russia's secret services were suspected of carrying out the attack, which he called an \"unprecedented act of sabotage.\"",
      "The explosion took place on a rail line linking the Polish capital, Warsaw, to Ukraine, and Polish officials said it was used to transport aid to Ukraine.",
      "Russia dismissed allegations that it was involved in the explosion, calling them \"Russophobia.\"",
      "\"The latest sabotage in Poland that could have become a mass casualty event brings even more heightened dimension to the debate,\" Landsbergis told CBS News on Thursday.",
      "\"Imagine if there would be 100 casualties \u2014 would we be still talking about hybrid? Or we would drop the hybrid and just call it war and ask for Article 5?\" Landsbergis said, referring to the mutual-defense agreement among NATO members. \"The question points to a fact that Russians are pushing the escalation lines even further, forcing us to ask ourselves: Aren't we at war already?\"",
      "The incident came amid a spate of airspace violations, including some near airports and military bases, in Western European nations, usually involving unidentified drones, but also, in at least two instances, Russian warplanes.",

    "story": [
      "Moss spores survived in outer space for a majority of 2022, and could even reproduce as usual when they were eventually returned to Earth, according to a new study from researchers who say their findings \"reveal the potential of terrestrial plants to endure extreme environments\" \u2014 including the extraterrestrial kind.",
      "\"Climate change highlights the importance of understanding life's survival limits for addressing global challenges and supporting future human habitation beyond Earth,\" reads the introductory text of the study, conducted by scientists at Hokkaido University in Japan. \"Understanding the resilience of Earth-born organisms in extreme and unfamiliar conditions, such as the space environment, is a crucial step toward expanding human habitats other than Earth like the Moon or Mars.\"",
      "The full text was published Thursday in the online journal iScience. It describes a pioneering effort to study bryophyte plants, such as moss, with the intent to learn more about the limits of their survival skills and gauge their adaptability. Although the plants' resilience was already well-known in environments on Earth, research on their survival limits more widely is still in its early stages, the study's authors said.",
      "For nine months, moss withstood the markedly harsh conditions of space \u2014 which very few Earthly creatures have ever done \u2014 while affixed to the outside of the International Space Station. While the spores' chlorophyll, which gives them their green color, did degrade during the experiment, scientists said more than 80% of them retained their viability after nine months outside of the space station.",
      "Different types of moss spores had individual strengths, like one that may protect against ultraviolet rays, heat and intensive light stresses, and another that \"could be used for planetary greening and life support systems,\" the authors said.",
      "Bryophytes have existed on Earth since at least 500 million years ago, when they began to advance from water onto land, scientists say. The plants continue to exist today despite the fact that Earth has changed considerably, and they have become known for their tolerance to desiccation, freezing and radiation, all of which made them good candidates to be studied in an extraterrestrial setting.",
      "In addition to surviving the 9-month period, the spores could still germinate after the experiment ended and scientists returned them back down to Earth, according to the study.",

      "The data was collected when a NOAA Hurricane Hunter airplane dropped a fleet of weather instruments into the raging storm, according to a news release from the U.S. National Science Foundation National Center for Atmospheric Research. The devices, called dropsondes, have small parachutes attached and between two and four readings per second before falling into the ocean.",
      "Dropsondes are the only devices that can record information on pressure, temperature, humidity and wind at once. The data is used in forecasts and weather warnings, including emergency alerts.",
      "\"When you're looking at a category 4 or 5 hurricane, you're not going to have an airplane flying that close to the surface \u2013 that would be totally unsafe \u2013 but you need to know what is happening near sea level because that's where people and property are most affected,\" said NSF NCAR engineer Terry Hock, who manages the Dropsonde program, in the news release. \"The dropsonde gets you information you can't get any other way and that's why it's been around for decades.\"",
      "One dropsonde used during Hurricane Melissa clocked a wind gust of 252 miles per hour shortly before falling into the ocean.",

      "To verify the data, V\u00f6mel and other researchers reviewed the numbers with a quality control software. They also confirmed that the reported 252 mile wind gust would have been physically possible, and that it tracked with the hurricane's behavior, as well as previous storm patterns. The review confirmed that the wind gust measurement was accurate.",

      "The government has warned platforms that demanding that all account holders prove they are older than 15 would be an unreasonable response to the new age restrictions. The government maintains the platforms already had sufficient data about many account holders to ascertain they were not young children.",
      "Social media companies will face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars (about $33 million) if they are found to be failing to prevent people under 16 from creating accounts on their platforms.",
      "Meta's vice president and global head of safety, Antigone Davis, said she would prefer that app stores including Apple App Store and Google Play collect the age information when a user signs up and verifies they are at least 16 years old for app operators such as Facebook and Instagram.",
      "\"We believe a better approach is required: a standard, more accurate, and privacy-preserving system, such as OS/app store-level age verification,\" Davis said in a statement.",
      "\"This combined with our investments in ongoing efforts to assure age \u2026 offers a more comprehensive protection for young people online,\" she added.",
      "Dany Elachi, founder of the parents' group Heaps Up Alliance that lobbied for the social media age restriction, said parents should start helping their children plan on how they will spend the hours currently absorbed by social media.",
      "He was critical of the government's only announcing on the complete list of platforms that will become age-restricted on Nov. 5.",
      "\"There are aspects of the legislation that we're not entirely supportive of, but the principle that children under the age of 16 are better off in the real world, that's something we advocated for and are in favor of,\" Elachi said. \"When everybody misses out, nobody misses out. That's the theory. Certainly we expect that it would play out that way. We hope parents are going to be very positive about this and try to help their children see all the potential possibilities that are now open to them.\"",
      "There was significant resistance to the legislation last year, however, including from some children's advocacy groups.",
      "Mat Tinkler, CEO of Save the Children Australia, said\u00a0in a statement\u00a0a year ago, when the ban was approved by Australian lawmakers, that while he welcomed the government's efforts to protect children from harm online, the solution should be regulating social media companies, rather than a blanket ban.",
      "He said the government should \"instead use the momentum of this moment to hold the social media giants to account, to demand that they embed safety into their platforms rather than adding it as an afterthought, and to work closely with experts and children and young people themselves to make online spaces safer, as opposed to off-limits.\"",
      "The\u00a0Australian Human Rights Commission, an independent government body, also expressed \"serious reservations\" over the law before it was approved, saying last year that there were \"less restrictive alternatives available that could achieve the aim of protecting children and young people from online harms, but without having such a significant negative impact on other human rights. One example of an alternative response would be to place a legal duty of care on social media companies.\"",

      "NASA released close-up images on Wednesday of the rare interstellar comet that's making a single pass through the solar system.",
      "One of the images shows the comet, also known as\u00a03I/ATLAS, as it moves through space about 190 million miles from Earth. It was taken from Manciano, Italy.",
      "The comet was first discovered in July and has been photographed several times. In early August, images released showed the comet from about 277 million miles away. A month ago, images taken by two Mars orbiters showed a bright, fuzzy white dot of the comet about 18,641,135 miles away from Mars.",
      "3I/ATLAS is only the third ever interstellar comet confirmed to enter our solar system.",
      "The comet is visible from Earth in the predawn sky by using binoculars or a telescope.",
      "\"Everyone that is in control of a telescope wants to look at it because it's a fascinating and rare opportunity,\" NASA's acting astrophysics director, Shawn Domagal-Goldman, told The Associated Press.",
      "The comet will make its closest approach to Earth on Friday, Dec. 19, coming within about 170 million miles, which is nearly twice the Earth-Sun distance. NASA spacecraft will keep tracking it as it moves through the solar system, crossing Jupiter's orbit in spring 2026.",
      "ESA's Juice spacecraft, bound for Jupiter, has been training its cameras and scientific instruments on the comet all month, particularly after it made its closest pass to the sun. But scientists won't get any of these observations back until February because Juice's main antenna is serving as a heat shield while it's near the sun, limiting the flow of data.",
      "Named for the telescope in Chile that first spotted it, the comet is believed to be anywhere from 1,444 feet across to 3.5 miles across. Observations indicate that the exceptionally fast-moving comet may have originated in a star system older than our own \u2014 \"which gives me goose bumps to think about,\" said NASA scientist Tom Statler.",
      "\"That means that 3I/ATLAS is not just a window into another solar system, it's a window into the deep past and so deep in the past that it predates even the formation of our Earth and our sun,\" Statler told reporters.",

      "One of 25 abducted students in northwestern Nigeria escapes",
      "Twenty-five schoolgirls were reported abducted from the Government Girls Comprehensive Secondary School in Kebbi state's Maga town Monday, but one escaped and is now safe, the school's principal told The Associated Press on Tuesday.

      "The Nigerian government has vehemently rejected the claims. Tinubu has said the characterization of Nigeria as a religiously intolerant country does not reflect the national reality. While Christians are among those targeted, analysts say the majority of victims of armed groups are Muslims in Nigeria's Muslim-majority north, where most attacks occur.",
      "\"Religious freedom and tolerance have been a core tenet of our collective identity and shall always remain so,\" Tinubu said on Nov. 1. \"Nigeria opposes religious persecution and does not encourage it. Nigeria is a country with constitutional guarantees to protect citizens of all faiths.\"",
      "Nigeria's central region has been plagued by violence for years as local herders and farmers often clash over limited access to land and water.

    "summary": "An airstrike killed 13 people in the Palestinian refugee camp of Ein el-Hilweh. It was the deadliest Israeli attack reported since a ceasefire in the Israel-Hezbollah war a year ago.",
    "story": [
      "The Israeli military carried out airstrikes in southern Lebanon Wednesday on what it said were Hezbollah weapons storage facilities after a drone strike earlier in the day killed one person and wounded several others, including students on a bus.",
      "The new strikes came as tensions between Israel and Lebanon are escalating. An airstrike Tuesday night killed 13 people in the Palestinian refugee camp of Ein el-Hilweh, in southern Lebanon. It was the deadliest Israeli attack reported since a\u00a0ceasefire\u00a0in the Israel-Hezbollah war a year ago.",
      "Meanwhile, hospitals in Gaza said Israeli strikes killed at least 21 Palestinians.",
      "Israel claims Hezbollah is regrouping",
      "The Israeli military warned Wednesday afternoon it would strike targets in several villages in southern Lebanon, describing them as Hezbollah infrastructure, and called on people to move away from the locations. More than an hour later, the strikes began in the villages of Shehour and Deir Kifa. There was no immediate word on casualties.",
      "Israel's military said Hezbollah was working to reestablish itself and rebuild its capacity in southern Lebanon, without providing evidence. It said the weapons' facilities targeted were embedded among civilians and violated understandings between Israel and Lebanon. Israel agreed to a ceasefire and withdrew from southern Lebanon last year. For its part, Lebanon agreed to quell Hezbollah activity in the area.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, an Israeli airstrike on a car in the southern Lebanese village of Tiri killed one person and wounded 11, including students aboard a nearby bus, the Lebanese Health Ministry and state media said. State-run National News Agency said the school bus happened to be passing near the car that was hit. The bus driver and several students were wounded, the report said.",
      "The Israeli military later said it killed a Hezbollah operative in the drone strike.",
      "In Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp, just outside the port city of Sidon, life appeared normal Wednesday, but Lebanese authorities prevented journalists from entering. At the scene of the strike, paramedics searched for human remains around a wall that was stained with blood. Several cars were burnt and broken glass and debris littered the ground.",
      "The Israeli military said it struck a Hamas training compound that was being used to prepare an attack against Israel and its army. It added that the Israeli army would continue to act against Hamas wherever it operates.",
      "Hamas condemned the attack and denied in a statement that the sports playground that was hit was its training compound.",
      "The latest Israel-Hezbollah war began Oct. 8, 2023, a day after Hamas attacked southern Israel, after Hezbollah fired rockets into Israel in solidarity with Hamas. The war killed more than 4,000 people in Lebanon, including hundreds of civilians, and caused an estimated $11 billion worth of destruction, according to the World Bank. In Israel, 127 people died, including 80 soldiers.",
      "Israeli strikes kill 21 in Gaza",
      "Hospitals in Gaza said at least 21 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes Wednesday on both sides of the yellow line established in last month's ceasefire. The boundary splits the enclave in two, leaving the border zone under Israeli military control while the area beyond it is meant to serve as a safe zone.",
      "Officials at al-Ahli, Shifa, Nasser and Kuwaiti hospitals reported they received the bodies of those killed from Gaza City, Khan Younis and the Muwasi area, the southern Gaza displacement camp. An Israeli strike also killed one person in Shijaiyah, a Gaza City neighborhood outside the safe zone where Israeli forces remain deployed.",
      "The Israeli military said its strikes responded to militants who had opened fire on Israeli forces in Khan Younis earlier in the day. It said no soldiers were killed.",
      "Israeli strikes have decreased since the ceasefire agreement took effect on Oct. 10, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, though they have not stopped entirely. The ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants, has reported 280 deaths since the truce began, an average of more than seven per day. Each side has accused the other of violating its terms, which include increasing the flow of aid into Gaza and returning hostages \u2014 dead or alive \u2014 to Israel.",
      "On Monday, the U.N. Security Council approved a U.S. plan for Gaza that authorizes an international stabilization force to provide security in the territory and envisions a possible future path to an independent Palestinian state. The vote was a crucial next step for the fragile ceasefire and efforts to outline Gaza's future after two years of war.",
      "Hamas, however, criticized the U.N.'s adoption of the plan, saying, \"Assigning the international force with tasks and roles inside the Gaza Strip, including disarming the resistance, strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favor of the occupation,\" according to Reuters.",
      "\"Any international force, if established, must be stationed solely on the borders to separate the forces and monitor the ceasefire, and must be entirely under the supervision of the United Nations,\" Hamas said, according to Al Jazeera.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Nov 2025 14:11:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump said the U.S. is getting involved in peace efforts in Sudan at the request of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said the U.S. is getting involved in efforts to strike peace in Sudan amid an ongoing civil war there, at the request of his \"very good friend\" Mohammad bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia.",
      "Mr. Trump made the announcement Wednesday as he spoke at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum at the Kennedy Center in Washington, one day after a lengthy meeting with the crown prince, known as MBS, in the Oval Office. The State Department has already said the U.S. has been working with international partners, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, to broker an end to the war, but the president said he views the situation \"differently now than I did just a day ago.\"",
      "The people of Sudan are suffering from a staggering humanitarian crisis, as the two-and-a-half-year war takes its toll. The power struggle between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, has displaced millions, sparked famine and led to claims of genocide. Mr. Trump said he wasn't planning to get involved in the yearslong conflict in Sudan, but the crown prince suggested he add Sudan to his list of peace deals he has helped broker. The United Nations says what's happening in Sudan is the greatest humanitarian crisis on Earth.",
      "\"His majesty would like me to do something very powerful having to do with Sudan,\" Mr. Trump told his audience at the U.S.-Saudi business forum. \"It was not on my charts to be involved in that. ... But I just see how important that is to you and to a lot of your friends in the room, Sudan, and we're going to start working on Sudan.\"",
      "The president's announcement was met with great applause in the room. Mr. Trump said his administration got started on working for peace in Sudan about half an hour after his meeting with MBS concluded Tuesday.",
      "\"And you know we've already started working on that, OK?\" he said.",
      "Earlier this month, a State Department spokesperson told reporters the Trump administration was engaging directly with the RSF and the Sudanese army, and called on both sides to \"move forward in response to the U.S.-led effort to conclude a humanitarian truce, given the immediate urgency of de-escalating the violence and ending the suffering of the Sudanese people.\"",
      "But the president's push for action draws more focus to the region, while spotlighting MBS' influence. Mr. Trump has emphasized his excellent relationship with MBS, as well as the \"great wealth\" the Saudis are pouring into the U.S.",
      "MBS announced Tuesday in the Oval Office that a planned $600 billion investment in the U.S. from Saudi entities would be closer to $1 trillion. The two leaders also signed what the president called a \"historic\" and \"strategic\" defense agreement, and the U.S. will be selling the Saudis extensive military equipment.",
      "The crown prince's visit has been filled with fanfare, complete with a military jet flyover, cannon fire and an elaborate White House dinner with some of the richest people in the world. But more meaningful to MBS is what Mr. Trump has said on camera about the leader of the country with a troubled human rights record.",
      "Despite Mr. Trump's intelligence agencies in 2018 determining the crown prince ordered the killing of journalist and dissident Jamal Khashoggi, Mr. Trump claimed in the Oval Office that MBS \"knew nothing about\" it. The president criticized reporters for asking questions about Khashoggi and Saudi involvement in the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Families of the victims are suing the Saudi government, and a federal judge reviewing thousands of pages of evidence from the attacks concluded the families can move forward with their case.",
      "\"We have an extremely respected man in the Oval Office today and a friend of mine for a long time, a very good friend of mine,\" Mr. Trump said Tuesday. \"I'm very proud of the job, what he's done is incredible in terms of human rights and everything else.\"",

    "summary": "Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll traveled to Ukraine this week on a fact-finding mission regarding military technology as the Trump administration explores restarting peace talks.",
    "story": [
      "Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday as part of a delegation of senior Pentagon officials on a fact-finding mission to discuss military technology and explore ways to restart peace talks, according to multiple U.S. officials.",
      "The delegation includes Driscoll, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George, the commander of U.S. Army Europe and Africa Gen. Chris Donahue, and Sergeant Major of the Army Michael Weimer.",
      "The White House picked Driscoll to lead the delegation, according to one U.S. official. It opted to send a delegation from the Pentagon in part because the officials will be able to speak from a military perspective, which may be more effective in getting through to the Russians, the official said.",
      "The Wall Street Journal first reported the visit.",
      "\"Secretary Driscoll and team arrived this morning in Kyiv on behalf of the administration on a factfinding mission to meet with Ukrainian officials and discuss efforts to end the war,\" Army spokesman Colonel David Butler said in a statement on Wednesday.",
      "During the visit, Driscoll will view Ukrainian technology from the Ukrainian military and defense industry, according to a defense official.",
      "Driscoll told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday that Ukraine's use of drones and AI technology is an \"incredible treasure trove of information for future warfare.\" He referred to the stunning surprise attack launched in June by Ukraine deep inside Russia \u2014 Operation Spider's Web \u2014 which used what Driscoll called a \"couple hundred thousand dollars worth of drones\" to destroy Russian equipment valued at about $10 billion. During Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's visit to the White House last month, he offered drone technology to the U.S.",
      "Over the course of a few days in Ukraine, Driscoll will also spend time with top Ukrainian leaders and is scheduled to meet with Zelenskyy to try to restart negotiations.",
      "A Ukrainian official told CBS the focus of the visit would be on the military situation on the ground in addition to plans for a possible ceasefire. The official said Driscoll's visit \"is extremely important, as we are stepping into a decisive phase now.\"",
      "\"Presidents Zelenskyy and Trump have already agreed to stop the conflict along the existing lines of engagement, and there are agreements on granting security guarantees,\" the Ukrainian official added, noting that Ukraine has also spoken with the group of over 30 countries that support it. \"Ukraine has also held talks with the \"Coalition of the Willing\" on the security guarantees.\" Ukraine has not agreed to permanently cede that territory to Russia.",
      "\"I think a lot of the questions are, how do we actually execute on the president's agenda of peace in that part of the world,\" Driscoll said on \"Face the Nation.\" \"I have not been to the White House, where it has not come up that we just want peace so that the American industrial base can thrive everywhere, and we have to focus on that part of the world unnecessarily right now.\"",
      "Negotiations to end the war have largely stalled since the spring, even after President Trump attempted to revive them in the summer and fall during a summit in Alaska with Russian President Vladimir Putin and a meeting at the White House with Zelenskyy.",
      "Since then, the U.S. has resumed intelligence sharing with Ukraine, which has used U.K-provided long-range equipment, as well as drones, to conduct attacks on Russia.",
      "A defense official also told CBS News that Driscoll intends to meet with Russian officials in the future, but there are no meetings scheduled yet. A Russian official confirmed to CBS News that Russia is open to any talks and negotiations, and reiterated that in August, Putin had invited Mr. Trump to Moscow.",
      "In an interview with Axios conducted Monday, Putin adviser Kirill Dmitriev said that he and Trump envoy Steve Witkoff had written a 28-point peace plan during a face-to-face visit last month in Miami.",
      "Just days after the Trump administration imposed sanctions on Russian oil and gas in October, Dmitriev traveled to the U.S. to hold previously scheduled talks with Witkoff in an effort to continue to make progress on a proposal to end the war, as a senior U.S. official described it at the time.",
      "Dmitriev is under U.S. sanctions himself, and the Treasury Department had to waive them so that he could\u00a0 travel to the U.S. Asked by Brennan on \"Face the Nation\" about those meetings, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent dismissed Dmitriev as a \"Russian propagandist.\"",
      "A defense official contacted by CBS News was unable to comment on the 28-point plan described by Dmitriev to Axios, but said that Driscoll intends to open the door to discussing a peace plan. A Russian Embassy official contacted by CBS declined comment on the reported 28-point plan. Dmitriev's spokesperson did not respond in time for publication.",
      "On Tuesday, at a news conference in Spain, Zelenskyy said he intended to meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to discuss \"a just peace for Ukraine.\" A State Department official denied reports that Witkoff would be traveling to T\u00fcrkiye for diplomatic meetings with Ukraine.",
      "Witkoff had not responded to requests for comment at time of publication.",

      "Navy crew members at a port on the Pacific coast conducted an underwater inspection of the Europe-bound merchant vessel, successfully seizing more than 450 pounds of suspected cocaine, military officials said on social media.",
      "During the underwater inspection, divers from the Buenaventura Coast Guard Station found seven \"suspicious bags\" that were sealed and contained the narcotics, the navy said.",

Officials released images and video of the operation, showing several packages on board a boat and alleged suspects surrendering and being pulled from the water.",
      "Last month, the Trump administration announced sanctions on Colombian President Gustavo Petro and his family members, accusing the leader of having \"allowed drug cartels to flourish.\" The sanctions followed months of friction between President Trump and Petro over U.S. migrant deportations and\u00a0strikes on suspected drug boats\u00a0off the coast of South America.",

    "summary": "100 new security cameras and unspecified anti-intrusion systems will be among the \"emergency measures\" implemented at Paris' iconic Louvre Museum.",
    "story": [
      "Paris\u00a0\u2014 The head of the Louvre Museum said Wednesday that new surveillance cameras and anti-intrusion systems will soon be installed at the Paris landmark after last month's stunning crown jewels heist.",
      "The cameras \u2014 some 100 of them \u2014 will be up and running by the end of next year while anti-intrusion systems will start to be put in place within two weeks, Louvre director Laurence des Cars said.",
      "She described the systems as equipment that will prevent intruders from getting close to the museum buildings but did not offer specifics. The new surveillance cameras will try to ensure \"complete protection of the museum's surroundings,\" she said.",
      "\"After the shock, after the emotion, after the assessment, it's time for action\" at the world's most visited museum, des Cars told the Committee of Cultural Affairs of the National Assembly.",
      "She said it was all part of more than 20 \"emergency measures\" that will be implemented. The new measures also include the creation of a \"security coordinator\" position at the museum, and the job has been posted this month, she added.",
      "On the day of the heist, it took thieves less than eight minutes to force their way through a window into the Apollo Gallery with the help of a freight lift and steal the 88 million euros ($102 million) trove.",
      "At least five people have been arrested, but none of the jewels have been recovered. Master jeweler and Parisian gem appraiser Stephen Portier told CBS News the thieves would struggle to sell the loot.",
      "\"The whole world knows about this robbery. Dealers will have pictures of every single piece up in their offices,\" he said. \"So if they think they're being offered diamonds from the Louvre ... they will ask some hard questions. And contact the police.\"",
      "Des Cars unveiled some new details about the security breach that allowed the Oct. 19 robbery, saying the power tools used by robbers to cut through the display cases were disc cutters meant for concrete.",
      "\"It's a method that had not been imagined at all\" when the display cases in the Apollo Gallery were replaced in 2019, she said. At the time, they had been designed primarily to counter an attack from inside the museum with weapons, she added.",
      "Footage from museum cameras show that during the robbery, the display cases \"held up remarkably well and did not break apart,\" she said. \"Videos show how difficult it was for the thieves.\"",
      "Des Cars stressed security improvement is a priority of the decade-long \"Louvre New Renaissance\" plan launched earlier this year, with an estimated cost of up to 800 million euros ($933 million), to modernize infrastructure, ease crowding and give the Mona Lisa a dedicated gallery by 2031.",
      "With the Louvre crumbling under the weight of mass tourism, des Cars has restricted the daily number of visitors to 30,000 in recent years.",
      "The famed glass pyramid inaugurated in 1989 was meant to welcome about 4 millions visitors a year, she recalled. This year, already more than 8 million people visited the Louvre.",
      "\"The extensive modernization that the Louvre underwent in the 1980s is now technically obsolete, with equipment that has been overperforming for 40 years,\" des Cars said.",
      "On Monday, the Louvre announced it was temporarily closing some employee offices and one public gallery because they were structurally fragile.",

    "story": [
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Tuesday ruled out allowing U.S. strikes against cartels on Mexican soil, a day after President Trump said he was willing to do whatever it takes to stop drugs entering the U.S. Meanwhile, Mexican and American diplomats were trying to sort out what may have been an actual U.S. incursion.",
      "On Monday, men arrived in a boat at a beach in northeast Mexico and installed some signs signaling land that the U.S. Department of Defense considered restricted.",
      "Mexico's Foreign Affairs Ministry said late Monday that the country's navy had removed the signs, which appeared to be on Mexican territory. \"The origin of the signs and their placement on national territory were unclear,\" the ministry said in a statement.",
      "On Tuesday, Sheinbaum said the International Boundary and Water Commission, a binational agency that determines the border between the two countries, was getting involved.",
      "The signs, driven into the sand near where the Rio Grande empties into the Gulf of Mexico, caused a stir when witnesses said men in a boat arrived at the local beach known as Playa Bagdad and erected them.",
      "The signs read in English and Spanish, \"Warning: Restricted Area,\" and went on to explain that it was Department of Defense property and had been declared restricted by \"the commander.\" It said there could be no unauthorized access, photography or drawings of the area.",
      "CBS 4 News Rio Grande Valley posted an image of one of the signs on social media.",
      "The U.S. Embassy in Mexico shared a comment from the Pentagon Tuesday about the incident, confirming that contractors putting up signs to mark the \"National Defense Area III\" had placed signs at the mouth of the Rio Grande.",
      "\"Changes in water depth and topography altered the perception of the international boundary's location,\" the statement said. \"Government of Mexico personnel removed 6 signs based on their perception of the international boundary's location.\"",
      "The Pentagon said the contractors would \"coordinate with appropriate agencies to avoid confusion in the future.\"",
      "Mexico had contacted its consulate in Brownsville, Texas, and then the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City. Eventually, it was determined that contractors working for some U.S. government entity had placed the signs, Sheinbaum said.",
      "\"But the river changes its course, it breaks loose and according to the treaty you have to clearly demarcate the national border,\" Sheinbaum said during her daily press briefing Tuesday.",
      "The area is close to SpaceX Starbase, which sits adjacent to Boca Chica Beach on the Texas side of the Rio Grande.",
      "The facility and launch site for the SpaceX rocket program is under contract with the Department of Defense and NASA, which hopes to send astronauts back to the moon and someday to Mars.",
      "In June, Sheinbaum said the government was looking into contamination from the SpaceX facility after pieces of metal, plastic and rocket pieces were reportedly found on the Mexican side of the border following the explosion of a rocket during a test.",
      "The area also carries the added sensitivity of Mr. Trump's order to\u00a0rename the Gulf of Mexico\u00a0as the Gulf of America, which Mexico has also rejected.",
      "Meanwhile, Sheinbaum on Tuesday again rejected Mr. Trump's offer of military intervention against cartels.",
      "\"It's not going to happen,\" Sheinbaum said.",
      "\"He (Trump) has suggested it on various occasions or he has said, 'we offer you a United States military intervention in Mexico, whatever you need to fight the criminal groups,'\" she said. \"But I have told him on every occasion that we can collaborate, that they can help us with information they have, but that we operate in our territory, that we do not accept any intervention by a foreign government.\"",
      "Sheinbaum said she had said this to Mr. Trump and to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on previous occasions and that they have understood.",
      "\"Would I want strikes in Mexico to stop drugs? OK with me, whatever we have to do to stop drugs,\" Mr. Trump said Monday, adding that he's \"not happy with Mexico.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump said Tuesday he will designate Saudi Arabia as a major non-NATO ally, marking a step up in defense ties between the United States and the Gulf monarchy.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the move at a black-tie dinner at the White House in honor of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia. The two leaders signed a new strategic defense deal earlier in the day, and Mr. Trump said Monday the U.S. will sell F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia.",
      "The designation could open the door to further collaboration between Saudi Arabia and the U.S. military, including easier access to U.S.-made military equipment. It's also a symbolic move: Mr. Trump said in brief remarks Tuesday evening that it would take \"our military cooperation to even greater heights.\"",
      "There are currently 20 major non-NATO allies, including other Middle Eastern countries like Israel, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Egypt, Tunisia and Jordan.",
      "\"A stronger and more capable alliance will advance the interests of both countries, and it will serve the highest interests of peace,\" Mr. Trump said during Tuesday's dinner.",
      "The U.S.'s close relationship with Saudi Arabia dates back eight decades, bookended by a meeting between King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud and former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt aboard a U.S. Navy cruiser in 1945. The two countries have long cooperated on defense, and in recent decades, they have been bound together in part by a mutual rivalry with Iran.",
      "During Tuesday's meetings \u2014 marked by elaborate White House ceremonies and a military flyover \u2014 Mr. Trump pressed for even further military and economic cooperation with the Gulf state. The White House said\u00a0Tuesday that Saudi Arabia will buy hundreds of tanks and fighter jets and will partner with the U.S. on artificial intelligence and civil nuclear issues, while bin Salman pledged to invest nearly $1 trillion in the U.S., up from $600 billion.",
      "Members of Mr. Trump's family also have some business interests in the country. Mr. Trump insisted earlier Tuesday he has \"nothing to do\" with those deals, and \"they've done very little with Saudi Arabia, actually.\"",
      "Still unclear is whether Saudi Arabia will sign onto the Abraham Accords, a series of diplomatic deals brokered by Mr. Trump between Israel and majority-Muslim states like the United Arab Emirates. Most of those agreements were inked during the president's first term, and Mr. Trump told \"60 Minutes\" he believes Saudi Arabia will also join.",
      "During an Oval Office event earlier Tuesday, bin Salman told reporters he wants to join the accords but needs to see a path toward a Palestinian state. Mr. Trump added that the two leaders \"had a very good talk on the Abraham Accords.\"",
      "But Saudi Arabia's human rights record makes it a controversial U.S. partner. American intelligence agencies concluded in 2021 that bin Salman approved the 2018 killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist who regularly criticized the country's regime in the pages of The Washington Post.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Tuesday he believes bin Salman \"knew nothing\" about the 2018 killing, and called Khashoggi \"extremely controversial.\" Bin Salman said it was \"really painful to hear\" about the killing.",

      "As part of that narrative, the NEA labels its opponents, presumably conservatives, as \"villains\" on multiple occasions.",
      "\"Name the villains who violate our values, expose their motivation of getting back into or holding onto power, and position them as a barrier to what our families need,\" the document explains in a section called, \"Architecture of a race-class gender narrative.\"",
      "Critical race theory, which the Trump administration has made efforts to root out of academia, is defended in the documents with critics being portrayed as \"racist.\"",

      "Sanzi suggested to Fox News Digital that the training documents show the NEA\u2019s federal charter should be questioned.",

Control the process, choose the report source and avoid links sent by strangers. Thanks to readers like Nick, more sellers can spot the trap before any money or data is at risk.",

      "A new Play Store update makes it easier to manage apps across all your Android devices. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The new uninstall button rolls out",
      "Google is rolling out version 48.8 of the Play Store, and it introduces a new \u2018Uninstall\u2019 button right on each app's listing. You can now remove an app from any of your devices directly from your main phone. This eliminates the need to pick up each device and remove the app one by one.

That long-winded method still works, but the new shortcut saves time and effort.

NASA said each discovery has helped scientists better understand how meteorites interact with the Martian surface over time.",

      "Every year, they target holiday shoppers with fake websites, \"too-good-to-be-true\" deals and scam emails that look identical to legitimate retailers. But here's the part most people miss: scammers don't just rely on luck. They already have your personal data before you even click \"add to cart.\"",
      "From leaked email addresses to exposed phone numbers and home addresses, your personal information is being bought and sold by data brokers, companies that collect and resell detailed profiles about you.

We let our guard down when we're rushed, distracted or excited by a deal. Staying alert during the holiday season can help you avoid data exposure and financial losses. Here are some of the most common scams you should be aware of.",
      "The surge of promotions during the holiday season is the perfect time for \"phantom stores\" to thrive. It's a fraudulent store that mimics the interface and products of a well-known brand. Once you purchase from such a website, you'll never receive your order as the store doesn't actually exist.",
      "Real-world example: Fake IKEA websites appeared with URLs spelled \"ikeaa-sale.com\" and \"ikea-blackfriday.shop,\" mimicking the official ikea.com interface with copied product images, logos and discount banners.",
      "They lured shoppers with huge discounts and clearance offers to steal credit card data. Eventually, they were reported and taken down, but the damage has been done.",
      "What to do?\u00a0Always check the URL of the store you shop at and only click links from the store's official website or social media.",
      "According to recent research, some of the most popular shopping apps like Temu are selling your location data to third parties. It's no surprise that you might receive fake delivery texts.",
      "Your leaked data fuels realistic \"order\" and \"delivery\" scams online. (iStock)",
      "MAJOR COMPANIES, INCLUDING GOOGLE AND DIOR, HIT BY MASSIVE SALESFORCE DATA BREACH",
      "Real-world example: Temu is a popular app for scammers to mimic. They can easily find your contact information and order details to text \"Your order couldn't be delivered.\" Each text contains a phishing link that can install malware on your device or steal your personal information. That's why Temu warns its users about the couriers they partner with.",
      "What to do?\u00a0Make sure the texts you receive come from a legit courier service and double-check it on the store's website.",
      "Some scammers use sophisticated phishing tactics to lure victims. They engineer emails from well-known brands, use an urgent tone, place malicious links and urge you to click on your order status. In reality, there is no order status \u2013 they're stealing your data.",
      "Real-world example: Amazon is one of the biggest online retailers worldwide, and that makes the brand easy to mimic. Scammers send emails on behalf of Amazon to try to steal customers' personal data because it's highly likely that their victims have used Amazon, making it less suspicious. However, phishing emails have some telltale signs you can look out for.",
      "What to do?\u00a0Never click on any suspicious links and always check the sender's contact information.",
      "When you shop online, you should be aware of the data you share, including your contact information, shopping habits, credit card details and more. All stores collect some type of data about you. However, some companies collect more than you think.",
      "Real-world example: The infamous Target controversy in 2012 revealed how big retailers use data analysis to predict your shopping behavior. The company collected shopping data and managed to produce a predictive model for soon-to-be mothers.",
      "They sent out brochures with baby clothes, vouchers for baby formula and more before the customers even knew they were pregnant. Thankfully, modern shopping looks a bit different. You can opt out of certain data collection and exercise your right to remove personal information from websites that collect it.",

      "THE TRUTH BEHIND THOSE MYSTERIOUS SHIPMENT EMAILS IN YOUR INBOX",
      "How scammers find you",
      "Imagine you're browsing for gifts online. Within minutes, your activity generates data points \u2013 device info, IP address, browsing habits that feed into online databases. At the same time, data brokers already have your full profile: age, income, address history, family members and even shopping behavior. These profiles are sold to marketers and often leak into criminal databases.",
      "That's why scam calls, texts and emails often feel so \"real.\" They use your name, the right retailer, even your city. They're not guessing. They've bought your digital footprint.",
      "The \"holiday cleanup\" your data needs",
      "Most people clear their browser cookies or delete old emails to \"stay private.\" But that's like locking your front door while leaving all your personal documents on the lawn.",
      "If you want to stop scammers from targeting you this holiday season, you need to remove your personal data from the source, the data broker databases that feed these scams.",
      "That's where a data removal service comes in. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "A major national security debate is unfolding, and it affects more than government networks. It touches your home, your devices and the Wi-Fi your family uses every day. The Commerce Department has proposed blocking new sales of TP-Link products after a months-long review into the company\u2019s ties to China, citing a growing TP-Link security risk.",
      "Multiple agencies, including the Departments of Homeland Security and War, supported that proposal. They believe the company\u2019s connections could expose American networks to foreign influence.",
      "Security experts warn that foreign-backed hackers have targeted home and office routers for years. These devices often act as silent steppingstones that help attackers move deeper into sensitive systems. When compromised, they can expose everything connected to them, including computers, smart home gear, military devices used on base and more.",
      "This potential ban would be one of the biggest consumer tech actions in U.S. history. It comes as lawmakers raise fresh alarms about Chinese-made cameras, routers and connected home products sold on military exchanges and in homes across the country.",

      "CHINESE HACKERS BREACH US NUCLEAR SECURITY AGENCY IN CYBERATTACK OPERATION, OFFICIALS SAY",
      "The proposed TP-Link ban stems from growing concerns that foreign-linked routers and cameras could expose American homes and networks to outside influence. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why military families are even more vulnerable",
      "Lawmakers from both parties say military households face extra risk. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, who leads a bipartisan group of 23 lawmakers, warns that TP-Link cameras and networking devices sold on Army, Navy and Air Force exchange sites could expose sensitive footage from base housing and dorms. Rep. Ashley Hinson, R-Iowa, echoed that concern, saying these devices could act as a backdoor for Chinese intelligence to collect information on service members and their families. Even when products appear out of stock, officials worry they remain popular in military communities.",
      "These lawmakers say Chinese laws could force companies to share data or push hidden software changes that weaken U.S. networks. They argue that this creates a real risk for households on or near military installations. While TP-Link disputes every allegation and states that it stores U.S. data inside America, lawmakers want a deeper investigation.",
      "\"China will use any way to infiltrate us, and we must ensure they cannot access our homeland or military bases,\" said Ernst. \"High-tech security cameras sending video and audio directly back to Beijing must be treated like the grave threat that they are. We have seen this playbook from China before, with Huawei Technologies, and need the Trump administration to investigate and determine if TP-Link is a Trojan horse compromising our national security.\"",
      "10M AMERICANS HIT IN GOVERNMENT CONTRACTOR DATA BREACH",
      "How Congress is responding to TP-Link security risks",
      "Ernst is pressing the Commerce Department to finish its investigation by Nov. 30. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, says TP-Link could give the Chinese government access to American networks and wants faster action. Their concerns reflect past decisions involving Huawei and Kaspersky, which lost access to the U.S. market due to national security risks.",
      "Congressional leaders say foreign-made smart home devices sold on military bases should face strict scrutiny. They see routers, cameras and other connected home gear as critical targets in a time when cyberthreats continue to grow.",

      "\"TP-Link emphatically objects to any allegation it is tied to the Communist Party of China, dependent on the Chinese government, or otherwise subject to interference under Chinese national security laws,\" the TP-Link spokesperson said. \"The company is not controlled by any government, foreign or domestic. TP-Link has split from and has no affiliation with the China-based TP-LINK Technologies Co. Ltd., which is separately owned and operated.",

      "\"This letter has nothing to do with security and everything to do with a competitor trying to remove TP-Link Systems\u2019 products from the marketplace. The \u2018open source information\u2019 the members reference is actually a manufactured echo chamber of false and misleading attacks that the media has parroted over the past year. Instead of directly engaging with TP-Link Systems, these members essentially pressed \u2018copy and paste\u2019 on unsubstantiated claims about our American company.",
      "\"TP-Link has not been contacted by policymakers to discuss the alleged concerns, but if we were to meet with them, they would learn that TP-Link has located its core security functions and data infrastructure in the United States.

      "\"TP-Link Systems currently holds a very small share of the U.S. security camera market, representing approximately 3% of the consumer market segment according to Circana checkout data. The company has virtually no business presence in the enterprise segment. Additionally, TP-Link Systems' router market share in the U.S. has been inaccurately reported as being much higher than it actually is. Recent market research from Dell\u2019Oro Group, Inc., found that TP-Link Systems' market share of residential Wi-Fi router sales in North America is under 10%.",

      "According to the statement provided to CyberGuy, the breach was limited to employment-related information tied to Hyundai AutoEver America and Hyundai Motor America. The company confirmed that about 2,000 current and former employees were notified of the incident in late October. HAEA said it immediately alerted law enforcement and hired outside cybersecurity experts to assess the damage.",

      "Cybercriminals targeted Hyundai AutoEver America\u2019s systems, exposing sensitive data. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why this Hyundai AutoEver America breach matters",
      "The exposed data reportedly includes names, Social Security numbers and driver's license numbers, making this breach far more serious than one involving passwords alone. Experts warn that these details can be used for long-term identity theft and financial fraud. Because Social Security numbers cannot easily be changed, criminals have more time to create fake identities, open fraudulent accounts and launch targeted phishing attacks long after the initial breach.",

      "According to the company, this incident was limited to employment-related data and primarily affected approximately 2,000 current and former employees of Hyundai AutoEver America and Hyundai Motor America. No customer information or Bluelink driver details were exposed. While some filings reference sensitive data types such as Social Security numbers or driver's license information, the incident did not involve Hyundai customers or the millions of connected vehicles HAEA supports.",
      "Earlier reports suggested that 2.7 million individuals were affected, but Hyundai says that figure is unrelated to the breach. Instead, 2.7 million is the estimated number of connected vehicles that Hyundai AutoEver America helps support across North America. None of that consumer or vehicle data was accessed.",

      "Hyundai also clarified that the United States has about 850 Hyundai dealerships and emphasized that the scope of this incident was narrow and contained.",

      "\"Hyundai AutoEver America, an IT vendor that manages certain Hyundai Motor America employee data systems, experienced an incident to that area of business that impacted employment-related data and primarily affected current and former employees of Hyundai AutoEver America and Hyundai Motor America. Approximately 2,000 primarily current and former employees were notified of the incident. The 2.7 million figure that is cited in many media articles has no relation to the actual security incident.

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "A Skagit County Superior Court judge ruled that images from Flock Safety automated license plate reader cameras in Stanwood and Sedro-Woolley qualify as public records under Washington's Public Records Act.",
      "Judge Elizabeth Yost Neidzwski said the images are \"not exempt from disclosure\" and explained that an agency does not need to physically hold a record for it to fall under the law.",
      "The request that led to the ruling",
      "The case began when Washington resident Jose Rodriguez asked Stanwood for one hour of Flock camera images. That request prompted Stanwood and neighboring Sedro-Woolley to ask the court to declare that vendor-stored data did not count as public records.",

      "Judge Neidzwski rejected that argument. She said the cities' ALPR images support a government purpose and meet the definition of a public record.",
      "SEATTLE ELECTS DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST KATIE WILSON AS MAYOR",
      "Flock Safety cameras use AI to capture license plate images in real time, tracking vehicles as they move through neighborhoods. (Flock Safety)",
      "However, Rodriguez will not receive the specific images he sought. The city had already allowed the footage to auto-delete after 30 days, and it expired before the ruling.",
      "We reached out to Flock Safety, and a spokesperson provided CyberGuy with the following statement:",
      "\"The Court merely declined to exempt these records from disclosure under Washington's extremely broad public records law. Nothing changed in the status quo in Washington as a result of this ruling \u2014 these records were covered by the law before the ruling, and remain so following the ruling. Unfortunately, some individuals in Washington have abused the breadth of the public records law to extort significant settlements from Washington communities for technical violations of the disclosure requirements, which we cannot believe is the intent of the law. We are supporting efforts to enact a legislative fix to this situation, which is costing Washington communities tens of thousands of dollars to stave off frivolous lawsuits.\"",
      "The Washington court ruling marks a major step toward transparency in how police collect and store surveillance data. (Flock Safety)",
      "Why the decision matters for transparency",
      "Flock's automated license plate reader cameras capture multiple still images of passing vehicles along with time, location and license plate information. Cities use the system to assist law enforcement with investigations, relying on stored images to identify vehicles connected to crimes or alerts.",
      "The court's ruling raises broader questions about how local agencies manage these images once they're created. By finding that the images qualify as public records, the decision forces cities to examine how long they retain this data, how it is stored and who may request access under state law.",
      "Privacy advocates say the ruling highlights the need for clear policies around retention and transparency, while law enforcement groups argue that access rules must still protect ongoing investigations.",
      "AI DASHCAMS ENHANCE TRUCKER SAFETY WHILE RAISING PRIVACY CONCERNS",
      "The debate continues as communities weigh the balance between public safety, privacy and the right to know what\u2019s being recorded. (Flock Safety)",
      "How this ruling impacts privacy and surveillance",
      "For years, cities and police agencies have argued that data stored by third-party vendors falls outside public records laws. They often make this claim even when the data documents activity on public roads. The Washington ruling did not settle broader questions about surveillance, but it rejected the idea that Flock camera images are exempt simply because a vendor stores them. This decision exposes a growing tension between how agencies use surveillance tools and what the public can access under state law.",
      "Beryl Lipton of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to defending digital privacy, free expression and transparency in technology, told Cyberguy,\u00a0\"The use of third-party vendors for surveillance and data storage is widespread and growing across the country, and allowing this to undermine the public\u2019s right to know is very dangerous. The government's primary obligation should be to its constituents, which includes protecting their rights under public records laws, not to the private vendors that they choose to employ while conducting mass surveillance. Whether an agency stores images and information on their own devices or on the private server of a vendor should not affect the appropriate disclosure of these records under public records laws. If the use of these devices makes it too difficult for a city to comply with the law, then the response should not be to circumvent the laws they find inconvenient, but rather it should be to only use vendors that won\u2019t get in the way of a city\u2019s ability to fulfill its responsibilities to their citizenry. Otherwise, they should not use these tools at all.\"",
      "What this means for you",
      "If your town uses Flock or other automated license plate readers, this ruling shows how Washington courts may handle future records requests. It confirms that ALPR images can count as public records, even when a vendor stores the data.",
      "The debate over privacy and safety continues. Supporters say public access builds trust and oversight. Critics worry that releasing vehicle data could expose sensitive details without strong safeguards or redactions.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This ruling shows how courts may handle data from automated license plate readers. It also reveals how much vehicle information cities collect. As a result, it raises new questions about who should access these records. In addition, the decision may guide future transparency debates in Washington.

      "But instead of activating anything, the PowerShell command connects to a remote domain named slmgr[.]win, which downloads harmful executables from Cloudflare-hosted pages. The main file, updater.exe, is a variant of the Aura Stealer malware. Once inside the system, it hunts for your credentials and sends them back to the attacker.",

      "In-vitro fertilization (IVF) can take a serious toll on families, not only emotionally but financially, especially when every cycle comes with new bills and no clear sense of what the full journey might cost. Gaia Family aims to change that by removing the guesswork around pricing with a blend of tech and AI-driven forecasting.",
      "Instead of worrying about unpredictable costs, couples pay a fixed upfront price or monthly installments that cover their planned IVF treatment, medications, embryo transfers and built-in protections if cycles or transfers aren't successful. It gives families a clearer path forward and support that lasts through the entire process.",

      "How Gaia Family was born",
      "Gaia Family was founded by Nader AlSalim, a former Goldman Sachs executive who knew the IVF struggle firsthand. After spending over $50,000 across five IVF rounds in multiple countries, he and his wife finally had a son. The experience left him frustrated by how little clarity the system offered and how emotionally draining the process could be.",
      "He saw that most fertility systems were built around procedures, not people. His goal with Gaia Family was to build something different, a program that uses data to empower families instead of leaving them to navigate uncertainty and mounting debt. That personal experience became the foundation of Gaia Family's mission to bring agency, transparency and compassion to fertility care.",

      "Start with confidence:\u00a0Pay monthly or upfront, then begin treatment knowing all your major expenses are covered.",
      "If a cycle doesn't result in viable embryos, Gaia's built-in protection covers another attempt, helping families try again without financial shock. Once you have viable embryos, your Gaia Plan allows you unlimited frozen embryo transfers (usually $5,000 each) at no extra cost until you have a baby. And, if none of those transfers result in a live birth, then Gaia will give you money toward another cycle. Plus, you have the option of including all of your PGT-A testing and your medication for a fixed cost, so you have even more protection throughout your journey. AlSalim, tells CyberGuy the company's mission goes beyond technology.",
      "\"At Gaia Family, we're using AI not to replace the human element of fertility care, but to bring more confidence to it,\" AlSalim said. \"Fertility treatment can feel like a game of chance \u2014 our technology helps turn it into a guided, informed journey. By analyzing millions of data points, we can forecast the most effective and affordable pathway for each individual, so patients can make decisions grounded in data rather than uncertainty. Ultimately, it's about giving hopeful parents more agency, transparency and peace of mind in one of the most emotional experiences of their lives.\"",

      "For many couples, this combination of data and compassion is transforming uncertainty into confidence and renewed hope. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why Gaia Family's model matters",
      "IVF in the United States can cost as much as $30,000 per cycle, and most couples need several tries. Each failed attempt adds more bills and stress. Gaia Family's fixed-cost model gives families financial predictability while keeping them emotionally supported. It also encourages clinics to focus on outcomes rather than repeated treatments.",
      "This approach is transforming how people view fertility care. Instead of relying on luck, families can benefit from AI insights to make better decisions. While it may not lower the medical costs yet, it changes how couples experience one of life's most emotional challenges, turning fear into informed planning and despair into hope. Gaia removes the spiraling costs, making couples' outcomes so much more cost-efficient.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you are thinking about IVF or egg freezing, Gaia Family's model could make your path more manageable. It provides upfront transparency about costs, protection against financial loss and a data-driven forecast of success. It helps you make decisions based on evidence rather than guesswork.",
      "Still, while AI can analyze data patterns, it cannot alter biology. Factors like age, health and genetics continue to shape outcomes. Even so, Gaia Family's system gives couples a sense of control that traditional fertility care rarely provides by serving everyone, with no eligibility criteria in terms of age or health factors. Knowing that your finances are protected can ease stress and allow you to focus on what matters most: building your family.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",

      "Several companies, including\u00a0Alef Aeronautics,\u00a0Samson Sky and\u00a0CycloTech are developing vehicles that can take off vertically or transform from cars to small aircraft within minutes.",
      "Some states are already laying the groundwork for this new era. Minnesota and New Hampshire have passed legislation formally recognizing \"roadable aircraft,\" making them the first states to treat flying cars as both vehicles and aircraft under state law. Pennsylvania now hopes to follow their lead with its own version through Sen. Marty Flynn's Jetsons Act.",
      "At the same time, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has begun approving real-world tests. In 2023, the FAA granted a special airworthiness certificate to SpaceX-backed Alef Aeronautics for its Model A prototype, allowing it to operate on roads and in the air for research and development. That approval marked the first time a flying car received official clearance for combined ground and flight testing in the United States.",

      "The Alef flying car is made of ultra-light material, allowing it to fly and travel on roads. (Alef Aeronautics)",
      "How the Jetsons Act would work",
      "Under Senate Bill 1077, Pennsylvania would officially define a \"roadable aircraft\" as a hybrid vehicle capable of both driving and flying. These vehicles would need to register with the state, display a unique registration plate and meet standard inspection requirements. When operated on highways or city streets, they would be subject to the same rules as other vehicles. When used in flight, they would remain under federal aviation oversight.",
      "The bill also clarifies how drivers and pilots must transition between ground and air operations safely. It allows take-offs and landings only in approved areas, except during emergencies. Flynn emphasizes that clear definitions and consistent oversight will prevent confusion for both motorists and law enforcement.

      "What this means for you",
      "If you live in Pennsylvania, this bill could one day change how you think about personal transportation. While flying cars remain in development, legislation like this sets the stage for their eventual arrival. Drivers may one day register, inspect and insure a flying car just like a regular vehicle. Pilots could use the same roadways to reach take-off zones before switching to flight mode.",
      "Even for residents who never plan to own a flying car, the ripple effects could be significant. New rules may influence local zoning, airspace management and infrastructure planning. Communities might see new vertiports or designated landing pads as part of urban development. Insurance companies and safety regulators will need to rethink how they handle this new class of hybrid travel.",

As autonomous vehicles, drones and hybrid aircraft evolve, state governments must adapt to keep up. This legislation shows Pennsylvania's willingness to lead rather than follow. While it may take years before you see a flying car parked in your driveway, the groundwork is already being laid. Lawmakers are thinking ahead about licensing, safety and how to integrate flying cars into existing traffic systems. That forward-thinking approach could one day make Pennsylvania one of the first states to see cars take to the sky.",

      "This fake Geek Squad invoice looks professional, but small red flags, like a generic greeting, expose the scam. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the scam works",
      "The scam depends on fear and confusion. Once you call the number, the person on the line sounds polite and professional. They might say they need to verify your payment or reverse a charge. In reality, they are trying to get your credit card number or convince you to install software that gives them access to your computer.",

      "How to stay safe from scam emails",
      "Scam emails like the fake Geek Squad invoice are becoming more common and more convincing. They use fear and urgency to make you click or call before you think. Protecting yourself means slowing down, verifying every detail and strengthening your digital defenses. Here is how you can stay safe.",
      "The phone number or link in the message connects you directly to scammers, so don't click or call.\u00a0 Once you engage, they can pressure you into sharing personal details or even install harmful software on your device. The moment I saw that \"Payment order settled\" email, I realized something was off because I don't even have a Geek Squad account. That alone was a major red flag. If you ever get a message about a service you never signed up for, delete it right away. Instead of calling the number in the message, go to the official Best Buy or Geek Squad website to confirm if there is a real issue with your account. Also, sign up for strong antivirus software. Antivirus software acts as your digital guard. It scans downloads, detects malicious links and warns you before dangerous sites load. Choose a trusted program that updates automatically and includes email protection features. This extra layer of defense can prevent malware from taking hold if you accidentally click something suspicious.",

      "Scammers often use email addresses that look real but have slight differences, such as extra numbers, misspelled words, or unusual domains. A genuine Geek Squad or Best Buy email will come from @bestbuy.com. Always hover over the sender's name to see the actual address before responding.",
      "If someone contacts you claiming to be from Geek Squad or Best Buy, stay calm and skeptical. Real companies do not ask for banking details, gift card payments, or remote access to your computer over the phone. Hang up and contact the company directly through its verified website or customer service number.",

Reducing your digital footprint makes it harder for criminals to target you with fake invoices or phishing emails.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.

It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Two-factor authentication adds another barrier between you and scammers. Even if someone steals your password, they cannot log in without the secondary code sent to your phone or authentication app. Turn on 2FA for your email, online shopping and banking accounts.",
      "Weak or repeated passwords make you an easy target. Create long, unique passwords for each account. A password manager can securely store them and generate complex combinations that are hard to guess or crack.",

      "Old software is one of the easiest ways for hackers to slip in. Keep your operating system, browser and security programs updated. Turn on automatic updates so you do not have to think about it. These patches often close known security holes that scammers exploit.",
      "Before reacting to any invoice or payment alert, go straight to the official account or service mentioned, such as Geek Squad, PayPal, Amazon or your bank. Log in directly through their website or app to verify the details. If nothing shows up there, the email is a scam. This quick step can save you from a costly mistake.",
      "Reporting suspicious emails helps stop scammers from targeting others. Most email services, including Gmail, Outlook and Yahoo, allow you to mark messages as phishing.

      "Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman arrives in Washington on Tuesday for his first White House visit in seven years, marking a pivotal moment to rebuild U.S.-Saudi ties and strengthen a partnership that remains central to American security and energy interests.",
      "Ahead of the meeting, a group of 9/11 survivors, first responders and victims\u2019 families urged President Donald Trump to hold Saudi Arabia accountable for its alleged role in the 2001 attacks. This follows a United States federal district court judge, George B. Daniels, ruling against Saudi Arabia's efforts to dismiss a lawsuit brought against it by the families of 9/11 victims, which alleged the country was party to the attacks.",
      "The visit comes as Trump has publicly confirmed the United States will sell F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, telling reporters on Monday, \"I will say that we will be doing that. We\u2019ll be selling the F-35s,\" a move that immediately places Israel\u2019s qualitative military edge and the region\u2019s future defense architecture at the center of the conversation.",

      "White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told Fox News Digital that \"President Trump looks forward to welcoming Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud to the White House, where the two leaders will participate in an official working visit. Thanks to our Dealmaker-in-Chief, the United States secured $600 billion in historic investments during the President\u2019s visit to Saudi Arabia earlier this year, and Americans can expect more good deals for our country spanning technology, manufacturing, critical minerals, defense, and more.\"",
      "A senior administration official, speaking on background, told Fox News Digital that the expected agreements will include a multibillion-dollar investment in America\u2019s AI infrastructure, enhanced cooperation on civil nuclear energy and defense sales aimed at strengthening defense cooperation between the two countries.",
      "The official added that the visit will also focus on the fulfillment of the Saudis\u2019 $600 billion investment pledge through dozens of targeted investments across key U.S. sectors.",
      "In Saudi Arabia, the visit is being seen as historic. Aziz Alghashian, a lecturer in international relations at Naif Arab University in Riyadh, said there is \"a lot of excitement. The Saudis have said they\u2019re not isolated in the region\u2026 this is back through open doors and the front door again.\" He said the moment reflects a broader shift in how Saudis understand their country\u2019s place in the world. According to Alghashian, Trump\u2019s repeatedly warm comments about the crown prince and the kingdom also contribute to a sense that Riyadh is re-entering Washington on strong footing.",
      "The visit by MBS will be his first White House appearance since the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which U.S. intelligence assessed he approved, a charge he denies.",
      "Jacob Olidort, director for American Security at the America First Policy Institute, told Fox News Digital that \"Saudi Arabia is one of the top partners of ours in the region,\" calling the trip \"well overdue, a reset of relations.\"",
      "At the heart of the visit is the emerging U.S.-Saudi security pact. Alghashian described its purpose in three words: \"elevate, facilitate and consolidate.\"",
      "In his view, the agreement is meant \"to elevate the Saudi-American relationship,\" transforming it from what he called a \"strategic partnership\" into a more formalized security alignment. Although not a full treaty, which Riyadh had previously pursued, the pact would still represent the most significant upgrade to the relationship in decades. He said the shift also has a domestic political rationale in Washington, arguing that being included in an \"alliance\" category \"helps make Saudi Arabia become more of a bipartisan issue, and not just necessarily a Trump legacy.\"",

      "Alghashian added that Saudi Arabia wants to finalize as much as possible now. \"The Saudis\u2026 feel urgency to get as much as they can from the Trump administration before these deals get complicated in the next administration,\" he said.",
      "That urgency extends to nuclear cooperation, where Saudi Arabia has made clear that while China and South Korea exist as alternatives, its preference is for an American program. \"Saudi Arabia really wants American nuclear cooperation because it adds more security,\" he said, adding that Riyadh will not \"wait forever\" if conditions become overly restrictive but sees the current U.S. posture as an opening.",

      "Olidort said Saudi Arabia has been \"very categorical\" in what it expects in a changed Middle East: a defense pact and movement on Palestinian statehood. He recalled hearing a senior Saudi official say recently that \"there will be no regional integration without Palestinian statehood,\" a line that reflects the kingdom\u2019s long-standing public position that recognition of Israel will only come after a credible pathway to a Palestinian state is in place.",
      "Still, Olidort said full Saudi-Israel normalization may not be necessary at this moment for U.S. priorities to advance. He said normalization \"doesn\u2019t need to be the immediate priority\" and suggested that \"an upgraded deepening of cooperation, but short of full normalization,\" could be possible if both sides see value in closer security integration.",
      "TRUMP SECURES DEALS WITH 3 MIDDLE EASTERN NATIONS IN 1ST MAJOR TRIP OF 2ND TERM",
      "That perspective is particularly relevant given the war in Gaza and Riyadh\u2019s position on reconstruction. As Alghashian noted, Saudi Arabia has said it \"will not do reconstruction unless Hamas is gone and Israel withdraws,\" a stance that places the kingdom at odds with any rushed postwar plan and, in his view, leaves the region \"in no man\u2019s land.\"",

      "Trump\u2019s decision to approve F-35 sales to Saudi Arabia adds another layer. Saudi Arabia has formally requested up to 48 of the fifth-generation jets, making it the largest potential F-35 buyer outside NATO and the first Arab state after the United Arab Emirates to receive them. The move would test Washington\u2019s commitment to maintaining Israel\u2019s qualitative military edge.",
      "Olidort, however, argued that the sale does not automatically threaten Israel\u2019s superiority. \"I don\u2019t know that it will mean Israel losing air superiority,\" he said, noting that Israel\u2019s defense and aerospace sectors are \"world-class\" and that the sale could \"potentially deepen collaboration between Israel and Saudi Arabia and make each of our partners\u2026 more effective.\"",
      "Beyond defense, the visit is also anchored in technology. Saudi Arabia is pushing for access to advanced American AI chips and positioning itself as a global data and energy hub.",

      "Olidort framed the issue bluntly, saying AI cooperation with Saudi Arabia is a strategic priority for Washington because \"the United States is in \u2018a race\u2019 with China\" and cautioning that \"if we don\u2019t get there, then we will be in a China-dominated AI space.\" That view reflects the broader U.S. assessment that the future of artificial intelligence \u2014 from data-center capacity to semiconductor access \u2014 is inseparable from great-power competition.",

      "In just 24 hours, the Justice Department has done a complete reversal on its position about whether the full grand jury in the James Comey criminal case reviewed the indictment before it was handed up to a federal judge in September.",
      "Lindsey Halligan, the acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, presented the case by herself to the grand jury on Sept. 25. She testified Wednesday that when jurors voted to indict Comey on two of the three counts submitted in the original indictment, the full grand jury hadn\u2019t reviewed a final revised document showing the two counts the former FBI director was charged with.

      "The subpoena also requested any communications or documentation Bish has from \"anyone claiming to be acting at the direction or request of Edward Martin,\" who is the Justice Department\u2019s self-described \u201cweaponization czar.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Justice Department declined to comment, citing the secrecy of grand jury investigations.",
      "Schiff's office also declined to comment.",
      "It is unclear if the grand jury investigation is specifically into any of the individuals named in the subpoena, including Pulte and Martin.",
      "The subpoena sent to Bish specifically cited records pertaining to \u201cthe investigation into Senator Adam Schiff.\u201d In addition to seeking information about anyone purporting to be or work for Pulte or Martin, the subpoena also requested communication and documentation on anyone \u201cclaiming to be working for or at the direction of\u201d the Justice Department, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, including Robert Bowes or Scott Strauss.",
      "The subpoena was signed by Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher Sarma in the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Maryland.",
      "Bish told NBC News at the federal courthouse in Greenbelt on Thursday that this is not her first time speaking with investigators about this topic, saying she told them in a previous interview much of what she said they discussed Thursday.",
      "Bish is running for Congress in California\u2019s 6th Congressional District, a seat held by Democrat Ami Bera.",
      "NBC News reported last month that the federal mortgage fraud investigation into Schiff had stalled.",
      "One of the president's chief political foes, Schiff served as the lead impeachment manager in the House during Trump\u2019s first impeachment trial in 2020. He has denied any wrongdoing in response to the Trump administration\u2019s investigation into mortgage fraud allegations.",
      "The probe has been going on since at least the summer. NBC News reported in August that Attorney General Pam Bondi tapped Martin to probe the allegations against Schiff.",
      "Martin, whom Bondi described as a \u201cspecial attorney,\u201d met with Pulte, who sent a criminal referral for the California senator to the Justice Department in May."

    "story": [
      "What began as a banner day for stocks turned into a major rout, as investors signaled ongoing skepticism about the longevity of the artificial intelligence boom and trimmed hopes of support from the Federal Reserve.",
      "The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 2%, and the broad S&P 500 index dropped by more than 1.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks 30 top-tier stocks, declined by nearly 390 points. It had been up 700 points earlier in the day. Cryptocurrencies also shed billions in value: Bitcoin had fallen below $87,000 as of late Thursday afternoon, weeks after having set highs above $120,000.",
      "The stunning turnaround added further unease to an already shaky economy that has forced households to trim budgets amid stubborn inflation and signs of a wavering job market. With an ever-increasing part of the economy's principal driver \u2014 consumer spending \u2014 now reliant on affluent households, an extended market pullback could inflict wider damage.",
      "\"You don\u2019t have to have the biggest bubble in history for an expensive stock market\" and end up seeing declines, said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak asset management group.",
      "Traders\u2019 hopes were boosted early Thursday by a better-than-expected jobs report that appeared to show the economy remained resilient. Even before the day began, stocks looked poised to rise after Nvidia, the chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom, reported strong quarterly earnings and revenue.",
      "Yet by midday, markets had turned red. The solid September jobs report diminished the odds that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next month to lower the cost of borrowing money to spur economic activity. When investors don't have to pay as much in interest, they often put those savings into stocks.",
      "\u201cThe broad rebound in payrolls suggests diminished risks of a higher unemployment rate,\u201d analysts with Morgan Stanley said in a note published shortly before noon. \u201cWe no longer expect a Fed cut in December.\u201d",
      "Losses were further compounded by ongoing concerns about AI \u2014 specifically, how much more profitable the companies buying chips like Nvidia's will be. The fears were articulated Wednesday evening on X by Michael Burry, made famous by the movie \"The Big Short.\"",
      "\"Just because something is used does not mean it is profitable,\" he wrote.",
      "Finally, the ongoing sell-off of bitcoin indicated to some traders that a key source of support for stocks \u2014 retail or day traders \u2014\u00a0were beginning to waver on their trademark \"buy the dip\" mentality.",
      "\"I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve flipped from bull to bear,\" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers financial group. \"I would say we\u2019ve flipped from bull to balanced market in the short term. A lot depends on whether sentiment continues to weaken.\"",
      "Stocks had already been showing signs of flagging in recent weeks. With Thursday's losses, the S&P 500 fell to its lowest point since September.",
      "The long-delayed September jobs report, which showed that the United States added a sturdy 119,000 jobs, appeared to show some glimmers of hope for the economy.",
      "Although the unemployment rate ticked up from 4.3% in August to 4.4%, about 450,000 workers entered the labor force. Economists view that as evidence that job opportunities are still plentiful, despite a wave of corporate layoffs.",
      "Just before the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the jobs report, Verizon told employees it planned to lay off 13,000 employees, or about 13% of its workforce.",
      "The company joined a suite of other blue-chip employers that say they plan to eliminate tens of thousands of jobs, including Amazon, General Motors, IBM, Microsoft, Paramount, Target and UPS.",
      "The details of the jobs report, which captured conditions before the government shutdown, as well more recent jobs data, suggested a more mixed picture for the U.S. economy.",
      "Manufacturing shed 6,000 jobs, continuing a trend in a sector the Trump administration has touted as a key target of its economic policies. Transportation and warehousing also lost 25,300 jobs. Wage growth slowed, and job totals for July and August were revised downward.",
      "The employment gains in September were concentrated in the health care, hospitality and social assistance sectors.",
      "Another snapshot of the economy came courtesy of Walmart, which on Thursday reported strong sales and raised its outlook for the year. That strength points to cracks in the economy, though. Executives said the chain is luring more high-income shoppers who are looking for bargains, and noted that lower-income families are feeling more pressure.",
      "\"As pocketbooks have been stretched, you're seeing more consumer dollars go to necessities versus discretionary items,\" Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said on an earnings call Thursday morning.",
      "Walmart's stock closed 6.5% higher."

      "Bloomberg Law and NBC News analyzed federal lawsuits and found at least 54 pregnant women or their families alleged severe mistreatment or medical neglect in county jails from 2017 to 2024. The catastrophes they describe signal a much larger problem, since filing a federal lawsuit is difficult, experts said.",
      "Most of the women in these cases were arrested on nonviolent charges that included probation violations, theft and drug possession. They were housed in jails, largely intended for short-term detention as criminal cases unfold, not prisons, which are for punishment after convictions.",
      "Here is a look at their cases:",
      "There\u2019s no way to be certain whether the pregnancy complications the women experienced occurred because of their time behind bars. About 10% to 20% of known pregnancies end in miscarriage. Stillbirths occur in about 1 out of 175 births.",
      "But unsanitary conditions and limited access to prenatal care, medical providers and critical medication are factors that can affect a healthy birth or contribute to preterm labor.",

      "The 54 cases in this article are drawn from more than 200,000 civil rights and prisoner-related complaints filed in federal district court from Jan. 1, 2017, to Dec. 31, 2024. Reporters identified relevant cases by searching nine civil nature of suit codes declared by the plaintiffs, as well as keyword searching the text of complaints to identify terms such as \u201cbaby,\u201d \u201cmother\u201d and \u201cjail.\u201d Pro se cases, in which people choose to represent themselves rather than hire attorneys, were largely excluded. The team also used Anthropic\u2019s Claude Sonnet 3.5 to summarize complaints and OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o to answer questions including \u201cDoes this case involve harm to a pregnant person?\u201d Reporters reviewed each of the potential cases and included them if they met the following criteria: The pregnant woman was housed in a facility that primarily incarcerates pretrial detainees and there were allegations of harm to the woman or her pregnancy while she was under the care of that facility."

    "story": [
      "Larry Summers\u2019 ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were long public knowledge. But the recent publication of emails between the two men show they were closer than had been publicly known, creating a dilemma \u2014 and a reputational headache \u2014 for Harvard University, the Ivy League institution where Summers is on the faculty and once served as president.",
      "In interviews this week, a group of Harvard faculty members and students decried Summers\u2019 email correspondence with Epstein, which continued more than a decade after the disgraced financier pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor. The two men chatted about politics and current affairs, and Summers looked to Epstein for advice on his relationship with a woman.",
      "Lola J. DeAscentiis, 21, an undergraduate student who is taking one of Summers\u2019 classes, said she believes his decision to step back from teaching at the university was \u201cthe very least that can happen.\u201d DeAscentiis is one of the organizers of a petition \u2014 \u201cTell Harvard: Shut Out Summers!\u201d \u2014 demanding that Harvard revoke Summers\u2019 tenure.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s hope that Harvard and people outside Harvard will recognize this is such a widespread issue on our campus,\u201d DeAscentiis said. \u201cEpstein is no longer alive, but his legacy is alive and well, and his friends are still in high places.\u201d",
      "Summers, 70, announced earlier this week he would withdraw from \u201cpublic commitments,\u201d including his role on the board of directors at OpenAI. Harvard, for its part, said it would investigate links between faculty members and Epstein. Summers then announced late Wednesday that he would go on leave from his teaching duties while that investigation unfolds.",
      "\u201cI am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused. I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein,\u201d Summers said in a statement earlier this week.",
      "Harvard\u2019s media office did not immediately respond to an emailed list of questions. Summers\u2019 spokesperson declined to comment.",
      "\u201cThe cozy friendship between Epstein and Summers on display in the emails is disgusting and disgraceful,\u201d Joseph Blitzstein, a statistics professor, said in a statement to The Crimson, Harvard\u2019s student-run newspaper. (Blitzstein did not respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment, one of dozens sent to Harvard faculty members this week.)",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has effectively called for Summers\u2019 ouster, saying in a statement that \u201cSummers cannot be trusted to advise our nation\u2019s politicians, policymakers, and institutions \u2014 or teach a generation of students at Harvard or anywhere else.\u201d",
      "It would not be easy for Harvard to cut ties with Summers, a former treasury secretary and White House adviser. He has a tenured position, a form of permanent employment in academia. Harvard\u2019s provost office says on its webpage that professors can be removed \u201conly for grave misconduct or neglect of duty\u201d by the Harvard Corporation, the school\u2019s highest governing body.",
      "Summers has not been accused of taking part in Epstein\u2019s criminal enterprise.",
      "In an interview, one professor said the recent scrutiny on Summers has reopened old wounds from his sometimes rocky time both as university president and instructor.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s known to be a bully,\u201d said Alison Frank Johnson, a history professor and the chair of the department of Germanic languages and literature.",
      "Johnson used a moniker that has trailed Summers throughout his academic career. The New York Times, summing up his term as president, once wrote he \u201calienated professors with a personal style that many saw as bullying and arrogant.\u201d",
      "Johnson said many on Harvard\u2019s campus have long been skeptical of Summers in part because of \u201cdisgraceful\u201d remarks he delivered at a closed-door economic conference in 2005. In a speech that year before the National Bureau of Economic Research, Summers said women might lack an \u201cintrinsic aptitude\u201d for science and engineering.",
      "Summers apologized and insisted his comments had been \u201cmisconstrued.\u201d The Faculty of Arts and Sciences lodged a vote of no confidence in his leadership. The furor, combined with other campus controversies, including a public clash with the public intellectual Cornel West, proved too intense to surmount. Summers resigned from the presidency in February 2006.",
      "Four months later, Harvard announced Summers had been named a \u201cUniversity Professor\u201d \u2014 the highest faculty rank, and an honor extended to only a handful of academic luminaries. He has held the distinction ever since.",
      "Summers has more recently drawn criticism from some on campus over his public stances on the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Summers, who has said he was \u201csickened\u201d by what he viewed as the university\u2019s silence after Oct. 7 and a rise in antisemitism, publicly castigated \u201cIsrael demonizing faculty\u201d \u2014 namely, Walter Johnson, a fellow University Professor.",
      "Johnson, a history professor and former adviser to the campus\u2019 Palestine Solidarity Committee, lambasted Summers in an email, calling him a \u201cprejudiced and unprincipled bully\u201d and assailing him for his criticism of pro-Palestinian activists at Harvard.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss him,\u201d Johnson said in part, adding that he did not have a clear-cut take on Summers\u2019 future at Harvard: \u201cWhether it is appropriate for the University to discipline someone for things \u2014 no matter how tawdry and small-minded \u2014 revealed in a state-sponsored dump of their private email seems to me to be an open question.\u201d",
      "The emails released by House lawmakers show that Summers and Epstein communicated as recently as 2019, more than a decade after Epstein pleaded guilty in Florida state court to soliciting prostitution from a minor. They continued to correspond until July 5, 2019, a day before Epstein was arrested and charged with sex trafficking of minors.",
      "The length of Summers\u2019 relationship with Epstein represents not \u201cjust one lapse\u201d but a \u201ccharacter flaw,\u201d Rachel McCleary, an economics department lecturer, told The Crimson.",
      "In one set of emails, Summers, who is married to the academic Elisa New, sought Epstein\u2019s advice on his romantic pursuit of an unnamed woman he described as a mentee. Epstein described himself as a \u201cpretty good wing man\u201d for Summers. Summers lamented that the woman seemed interested in someone else: \u201cI dint [sic] want to be in a gift giving competition while being the friend without benefits.\u201d",
      "Epstein replied: \u201cshes smart. making you pay for past errors. ignore the daddy im going to go out with the motorcycle guy, you reacted well.. annoyed shows caring., no whining showed strentgh.\u201d (NBC News is quoting from the messages verbatim, typos included.)",
      "In another set of emails, Summers decried that men who \u201chit on\u201d women may face repercussions in the workplace. In an email dated Oct. 27, 2017, Summers revisited the subject of intellectual differences between men and women, telling Epstein: \u201cI observed that half the IQ in world was possessed by women without mentioning they are more than 51 percent of population.\u201d",
      "The cache of emails has been the subject of extensive reporting from The Crimson, which broke the news on Wednesday night that Summers would not finish his remaining three class sessions this semester and planned to go on leave as director of the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at the Harvard Kennedy School.",
      "Epstein\u2019s ties to Harvard have been extensively documented. Harvard carried out what it characterized as a \u201cfull review\u201d of the financier\u2019s connections to the university, releasing a 27-page report in May 2020 that confirmed the school received $9.1 million in gifts from him between 1998 and 2008.",
      "The report said \u201cno gifts were received from Epstein following his conviction in 2008.\u201d (Epstein served a year in Florida jail as part of a secret agreement with federal prosecutors that later led to an internal Justice Department investigation. Epstein\u2019s death in custody in 2019 while awaiting federal prosecution was ruled a suicide.)",
      "Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard law professor, said in an email to NBC News that the recent revelations about Summers\u2019 relationship with Epstein raise questions about the 2020 report.",
      "\u201cI think the important thing is that Harvard is revisiting the report they wrote in 2020,\u201d Lessig wrote. \u201cBut the important output from that effort should not just be what we all know \u2014 that Larry was integral to Epstein\u2019s relationship to the University \u2014 but the part we don\u2019t know: Why did Harvard hide this connection in 2020? Their report was Hamlet without the prince. Why?\u201d",
      "Harvard did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Lessig\u2019s email.",
      "The day before Summers announced he would step back from teaching, he returned to a Harvard lecture hall and directly addressed the Epstein scandal, according to a video posted on TikTok that was verified by NBC News.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s very important to fulfill my teaching obligations,\u201d he told his students, \u201cand so, with your permission, we\u2019re going to go forward and talk about the material in the class.\u201d",
      "Summers changed his public position by the following night, and his future at Harvard remains unclear.",
      "\u201cMr. Summers has decided it\u2019s in the best interest of the Center for him to go on leave from his role as Director as Harvard undertakes its review,\u201d Summers\u2019 spokesman, Steven Goldberg, said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "\u201cHe is not scheduled to teach next semester,\u201d Goldberg added."

      "In recent weeks, the \u201cFriends\u201d YouTube channel finished releasing the final eight episodes of the two-season series, which were never broadcast in the United States after NBC canceled \u201cJoey\u201d in 2006 due to low ratings.",
      "The channel made the show available online for the first time earlier this year when it began regularly releasing full episodes, starting with the pilot of Season 1, 19 years after the show\u2019s cancellation. All episodes have been uploaded as of this week.",

      "The spinoff sequel follows Joey as he moves to Los Angeles to further pursue his acting dreams.

      "\u201cOn \u2018Friends,\u2019 Joey was a womanizer, but we enjoyed his exploits. He was a solid friend, a guy you knew you could count on,\u201d Bright said. \u201cJoey was deconstructed to be a guy who couldn\u2019t get a job, couldn\u2019t ask a girl out. He became a pathetic, mopey character. I felt he was moving in the wrong direction, but I was not heard.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Jelly Roll has debuted a new look that even shocked himself while reacting to a recent milestone moment: receiving three nominations at the upcoming 2026 Grammys.",
      "On Nov. 20, the 40-year-old musician uploaded a vlog to YouTube, marking his \u201clong overdue\u201d comeback to the video style that he used during the early days of his career. The 15-minute clip began with footage of him on his Nashville farm and ended with Jelly Roll deciding to shave his beard for the first time in over a decade.",
      "He shared that he wanted to shave his beard as he continues his weight loss journey.",
      "\u201cAt this point, I\u2019m sure some of y\u2019all are exhausted about hearing about my weight loss. But a lot of things change when you start losing weight. You realize things. One of the things I realized is I don\u2019t know what I look like. I\u2019ve had a beard to try to cover up my double chin,\u201d he said.",
      "Jelly Roll added, \u201cThe last time my face was shaved I was fresh out of jail.\u201d",
      "He predicted that he might resemble a Ninja Turtle after shaving his facial hair, but said he wanted to go through with it so he could surprise his family with his new appearance. He shared that he only told his wife, Bunnie XO, about his plans to shave his beard and that his daughter, Bailee Ann, had never seen him without it.",
      "The \u201cGet By\u201d singer used timelapse editing to show him slowly removing his beard as his wife looked on and filmed the moment on her phone. About halfway through the process, he turned to Bunnie XO, who appeared stunned.",
      "\u201cOh my gosh,\u201d she said as he laughed. She later gave her stamp of approval when he finished, telling her husband, \u201cI love it.\u201d",
      "He blurred out his face in the shot, saving the reveal for the last minutes of the video. Before he debuted his look to his fans, he showed off his clean-shaven face to his daughter, who instantly responded with laughter.",
      "\u201cStay over there!\u201d she playfully told her dad. \u201cOh my gosh, I\u2019m going to cry. I don\u2019t like this! You look like a turtle.\u201d",
      "Without further ado, Jelly Roll finally turned the camera toward himself for the grand reveal.",
      "\u201cBy now, you have probably figured out that I look like a Ninja Turtle,\u201d he joked while strolling through a wooded area. \u201cYeah, this was crazy.\u201d",
      "Taking a more sentimental tone, he continued, \u201cYou know, one of the reasons I\u2019d even started growing a beard was because I was so obese, it was just easier to cover up what was happening here.\u201d",
      "He then went on to talk about \u201cthe craziest thing\u201d that has ever happened to him: his latest Grammy nominations. When the Recording Academy announced the list of nominees for the 2026 Grammys on Nov. 6, Jelly Roll was one of the many stars who received the coveted recognition. He was nominated for best contemporary country album for \u201cBeautifully Broken,\u201d best country duo/group performance for his collaboration with Shaboozey called \u201cAmen\u201d and best contemporary Christian music performance/song for \u201cHard Fought Hallelujah.\u201d",
      "In his vlog, Jelly Roll recalled receiving his first Grammy nomination at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards in 2024 for best new artist. He said that at the time he never imagined he would be recognized by the Recording Academy again.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t care what artists say. I don\u2019t care what artists act like. I\u2019m going to tell you the real truth. There\u2019s not an artist in the world that didn\u2019t grow up watching the Grammys when they were a kid and walk in their bedrooms afterwards and rehearse their speech,\u201d he said. \u201cGod will take something that\u2019s either normal and make it extremely abnormal or he will take something that\u2019s already incredible and make it absolutely mesmerizing, and that\u2019s the case here.\u201d",
      "He said that now he gets to celebrate this achievement while in \u201cthe best headspace.\u201d",
      "\u201cI see all my friends in this category. But then I just see standing there is this album called \u2018Beautifully Broken,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cMan, if that doesn\u2019t represent what\u2019s happening in the world right now. I think more than ever\u2026 I think we can find beauty in what\u2019s happening. Win, lose or draw. Holy f---, dude, we won.\u201d",
      "He expressed his gratitude again to the Record Academy and said he wouldn\u2019t have accomplished anything without his faith.",
      "Before signing off, he encouraged his fans to mock his beardless face.",
      "\u201cI thought my chin went at least a half inch further than it actually went, f---. I didn\u2019t know. Failed science experiment, y\u2019all!\u201d he said.",
      "Jelly Roll uploaded the snippet of his newly shaven face to Instagram, too. Celebrity friends complimented him about his Grammy nominations beneath the post.",
      "Charlie Puth said, \u201cVery inspiring man.\u201d",
      "Country singer Carly Pearce echoed that sentiment, calling Jelly Roll \u201can inspiration.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, fans gave their approval of his look.",
      "\u201cFresh fit and clean faced,\u201d one fan commented.",
      "Another said, \u201cShut up I love it!!! You look so good!!!!!\u201d",
      "\u201cHey i love ninja turtles,\u201d a third wrote.",
      "This is the latest dramatic transformation Jelly Roll has shared with his fans. Over the past year, he has also opened up repeatedly about losing weight.",
      "While appearing on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d in April, he said his goal was to be under 250 pounds before explaining why losing weight is important to him.",
      "\u201cTo do all the fun stuff in life, you\u2019ve gotta be under 250,\u201d he told host Jimmy Kimmel before mentioning skydiving, riding a rollercoaster, riding a bull and wrestling an alligator. \u201cI\u2019ve got a list of things I want to do.\u201d",
      "He gave a progress update in August while giving a speech to the Tennessee Titans. \u201cI lost 200 pounds,\u201d he said. \u201cI told coach I\u2019m getting a contract if I lose another 50.\u201d"

      "After eight weeks of marriage, the cast of \"Married at First Sight\" reached the end of their romantic experiment in the Season 19 finale.",
      "During the action-packed episode, the five couples were tasked with deciding whether to stay married to the person they met for the first time at the altar \u2014 or go their separate ways.",
      "Following the finale, the entire Season 19 cast got together for a reunion special to share the current status of their relationships since filming wrapped a year and a half ago.",
      "Who ended up together and who got divorced? Here's a full recap.",
      "Jalyn and Josh",
      "How it started: After getting married at first sight, Jalyn and Josh quickly reached a level of comfort with each other. They embarked on the experiment alongside Jalyn's mother, Belynda, who married Chad at first sight.",
      "How it went: Over the course of eight weeks, the newlyweds encountered several highs and lows. They experienced trust issues when Josh claimed that he had unfollowed his ex-girlfriend on social media, but later revealed that he hadn't.",
      "The couple learned that they had a few key personality differences when Josh expressed how passionate he was about attending music festivals, namely Burning Man. Jalyn didn't share the same interest and wasn't sure that she'd feel comfortable attending the event. Josh was concerned that he would lose the sense of community he finds at Burning Man if his wife didn't support his passion.",
      "How it ended in the season finale: Going into decision day, Josh was feeling \u201cextremely thankful\u201d about his experience with Jalyn.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve definitely had our ups and downs but I think we\u2019ve had far more ups and the downs have always brought us closer,\u201d he said.",
      "Josh acknowledged that he envisioned \"a great future\" with his wife and said decision day would \"take a part of me with it\" if Jalyn decided against continuing their marriage.",
      "Meanwhile, Jalyn opened up about her \"biggest reservations\" as she prepared for decision day, saying she and Josh are \"different people\" who are \"in two different lanes in a lot of ways.\"",
      "\"I feel like this is make or break for me. I think in the past anytime I saw a red flag, I ended the relationship but now I'm married and I don't know what you work through and what you don't. But I hope to feel confident and secure in my decision,\" she said.",
      "When decision time arrived, Both Jalyn and Josh decided to stay married and expressed confidence in the way they had addressed obstacles in their relationship so far.",
      "Are they still together? No. During the reunion special, Jalyn revealed that she and Josh broke up three months before filming the reunion. They both had different versions of their breakup story, with Jalyn saying Josh broached the subject while they were on vacation.",
      "\"He looked at me and he said, 'I don't feel connected to you anymore. I want to break up,'\" she recalled.",
      "After agreeing to try to work things out, they went home and a few days later, Josh initiated the breakup again.",
      "Jalyn said she bent over backwards to channel her adventurous side and did attend Burning Man, along with several other music festivals, for Josh. In the end, however, he said she wasn't adventurous enough for him.",
      "Jalyn also claimed that Josh \"lied\" about many things in their relationship, such as telling her a female coworker was younger than he originally stated.",
      "Meghann and Derrek",
      "How it started: When Meghann and Derrek got married, the physical attraction was immediately present. The newlyweds shared a passion for healthy living and seemed to have a lot in common.",
      "How it went: Meghann and Derrek encountered a few issues throughout the experiment. For instance, Derrek thought Meghann was too defensive in their conversations, and she wanted him to be more vulnerable. They also had misaligned expectations on their household roles and duties.",
      "When Meghann discovered that she was pregnant, their relationship shifted for the better, with both of the newlyweds committing to their connection.",
      "How it ended in the season finale: On decision day, Derrek noted that Meghann's pregnancy added \"a whole other element\" to the experiment. Still, he was feeling confident going into the discussion.",
      "On her way to filming, Meghann reflected on the moment, saying, \"We have a lot of things that are gonna hit us, a lot of new things in the future that we're gonna have to figure out. And we need to really work through this.\"",
      "While sitting down with the relationship experts, the couple announced their pregnancy. When the big moment arrived, Derrek went first and shared his decision.",
      "\"You are extremely caring and compassionate and without any hesitation, 100% I want to stay married to you. I love you and I love your sense of humor. I love your pretty smile and your big blue eyes and I am really excited to start a family with you. I think you'll make an amazing mom and I'm just really excited for our future,\" he said.",
      "Meghann told her husband he makes her \"a better person\" and expressed her devotion to him.",
      "\"I am so excited to raise a child with you, so I am choosing to stay married to you because I can't imagine being away from you and I love you,\" she said.",
      "Are they still together? No. After agreeing to stay together in the season finale, the couple experienced a miscarriage. Despite Meghann's suggestion that they go to couples' therapy, they still struggled to communicate. One day, they had a fight and Derrek broke up with his wife over the phone then moved out.",
      "\"There's never a good time to do it. It's always going to be hard. I knew that this wasn't the right person for me. I had to be true to myself and be true to Meghann,\" Derrek said.",
      "Meghann offered her take on the breakup, saying, \"When he broke up with me, something in my head changed and I couldn't remember anything good from our relationship. I just remembered all the bad. And then I watched (the show) and then I remembered all the good and that was hard.\"",
      "Meghann said she doesn't see Derrek as a \"bad person,\" but said he didn't handle their breakup well.",
      "\"I wasn't happy. I don't think Meghann was happy,\" he said.",
      "Rhonda and Pat",
      "How it started: It didn't take long for chemistry to spark between Rhonda and Pat on their wedding day. The couple had plenty of fun at their reception and even jumped in the pool together. It was soon apparent that their fun-loving personalities were a good match.",
      "How it went: Once they started diving deeper in their relationship, Rhonda and Pat hit a few roadblocks. Rhonda told her husband she didn't feel like he was interested in hearing about her life since he regularly made the conversation about him. He was taken aback and tried to remedy the situation.",
      "Still, it was a consistent theme throughout the eight-week experiment for the newlyweds.",
      "How it ended in the season finale: While preparing to make his decision Pat admitted that he was feeling \"conflicted.\"",
      "\"Despite the disconnects and the challenges that Rhonda and I have had, we did make a deep connection. And I feel in my heart that I have established deep love for Rhonda,\" he said.",
      "While reflecting on the decision awaiting her, Rhonda said she wanted Pat to know that she \"really sincerely appreciated him and his commitment to this marriage.\"",
      "\"It's been hard but also it's been everything I think I could have ever hoped for,\" she said.",
      "When it came time to share their decisions, Rhonda said she suspected that Pat didn't want to stay married based on his closed off body language. He then explained that he ignored red flags in his first marriage and didn't want to do that this time around.",
      "\"I do not trust that I will be seen and heard as my authentic self,\" he said.",
      "Rhonda wasn't sure what he meant, so Pat explained that he had struggled hearing her repeatedly allege he didn't care about her.",
      "The relationship experts on hand encouraged the couple to talk through their issues. Rhonda apologized to Pat but said her emotional needs hadn't been met.",
      "\"I just think I've been really, really frustrated with you and my frustration pushes you away. And that's not my intention. I'm struggling on how to deal with it. So I would (like to) apologize for making you feel like I'm pushing you away,\" she said.",
      "Pat thanked his wife and said he went into the discussion not wanting to move forward, but was now thinking he may be \"being too rigid.\"",
      "Ultimately, Pat decided he wanted to continue to work on their marriage. Rhonda said she didn't feel \"as open or hopeful\" as she did going into the discussion, but wasn't ready to give up on their relationship.",
      "Are they still together? No. During the reunion, Rhonda said she and Pat stayed together for nine months after decision day. At that point, Pat went to Europe for a month on his own. He did invite her to go, but she'd already taken a lot of time off from work and decided to stay home.",
      "When Pat returned home, Rhonda said she was \"on cloud nine\" for a period of 10 days. One day, she saw him listening to a meditation about anger and asked if he was angry that they hadn't slept together since he got home. He was, and at dinner that night he told Rhonda he was done with their relationship.",
      "During the reunion, Pat said he'd felt that way \"for quite some time.\" Rhonda then explained that he was \"very insecure\" and said \"that insecurity was a complete turnoff romantically.\"",
      "Rhonda suggested that Pat only wanted a wife, and not necessarily her, adding that he wanted physical intimacy that would turn into a romantic connection. However, she wanted a connection and said intimacy would be the icing on the cake.",
      "Belynda and Chad",
      "How it started: When Belynda and Chad got married, it was a slow burn at first. However, they both seemed committed to exploring their connection and shared some sweet moments as they got to know each other.",
      "How it went: Chad repeatedly expressed frustration with Belynda's dog sleeping in their bed throughout the experiment. He also grew tired of the filming schedule and said \"I don't give a f--- about this show\" during one heated moment. Still, the couple's connection grew over time.",
      "Before decision day, Belynda said she was doubtful that she'd want to stay married based on Chad's recent aggressive behavior.",
      "How it ended in the season finale: Belynda described her husband as \"kind, funny and sweet\" on decision day but admitted that her marriage had been \"a little exhausting at times.\"",
      "\u201cI just don\u2019t want to lose my voice. I can\u2019t lose myself in a marriage and I feel like I need to remember that I\u2019m also there and that I also matter,\u201d she said.",
      "In a confessional interview, Chad said he wanted to be with his wife and couldn't \"imagine my life without Belynda.\"",
      "He also acknowledged that he had \"hurt\" his wife at times with his impatience and said he needed \"to find healthier ways to burn off some steam.\"",
      "When the moment to make a decision arrived, Chad went first, saying, \"I genuinely care about you and I believe you care about me. And I don't think there's anything we can't figure out as long as (we keep that in mind).\"",
      "Chad said he was willing to do \"whatever it takes\" to make their marriage work and asked if Belynda was willing to stay together.",
      "\"I mean, I think if anything, if I had a reason to walk away it would just be because we weren't working on it the way we committed and said we were going to. But I know that if we're working on it, we can get through it, so yes, I will stay married to you,\" she replied.",
      "Are they still together? No. During the reunion special, Belynda and Chad announced that they were no longer married.",
      "They both recalled an incident with his cat and her dog after they returned home from decision day, saying Chad was triggered by the animals' behavior and his anxiety came out as he began to yell at Belynda, saying her dog wasn't trained.",
      "Belynda said the incident reminded her of a prior marriage when her ex-husband would yell. She decided to grab her things and left with the dog.",
      "While reflecting on their relationship, Belynda also said Chad's drinking issues were an obstacle for her to overcome.",
      "Brittany and Will",
      "How it started: Brittany and Will had a sweet connection after  they met for the first time at the altar. However, things were understandably a bit awkward at first.",
      "How it went: While getting to know each other, Brittany and Will struggled with communication issues. Brittany wanted her husband to open up and be more expressive with his emotions, but he was slow to show his vulnerable side.",
      "How it ended in the season finale: On decision day, Brittany was \"hopeful\" when she woke up. Then Will called her to say his answer was no. Still, they both showed up to the discussion to talk things out.",
      "Will arrived first and told the relationship experts he intended to leave his marriage.",
      "\"I think that throughout this, her not thinking I'm trying, her not thinking that I'm doing anything, her not feeling anything from what I'm doing, that was the theme,\" he said.",
      "Will went on to say that his wife \u201ctries to compare things to how she feels them\u201d and said \u201cif it\u2019s not how she feels, then it doesn't matter and it's not validated.\u201d",
      "When Brittany arrived, she apologized to her husband for not being able to \"express how important\" he was to her. She then called him \"the most kind, genuine, thoughtful person.\"",
      "\"I'm just so sorry if I haven't made you feel that way, if I haven't made you feel like you're important to me and your feelings are important to me, because they are,\" she said.",
      "\"I'm thankful that I was able to make you feel those things in those ways. I didn't know,\" Will replied.",
      "Will said he needed more time and walked away to gather his thoughts. When he returned, Will decided to give their marriage another try.",
      "\"Yes, I do want to be with you and I do want to continue this and I want to learn with you,\" he said.",
      "Are they still together? No. During the reunion, Brittany revealed that she and Will hadn't spoken together since the show ended. She recalled how he went away for work for a week after the finale then ended things when he returned.",
      "Will shared his side of the story, saying he did \"adore\" Brittany and decided to stay with her in the heat of the moment since he didn't want to see her sad. However, she said she \"had an inkling\" that they would break up when he returned home."

      "Colleen Hoover says the legal saga involving \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d stars Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni has been tough for her to process.",
      "Hoover is the author of the 2016 book that was the basis for the 2024 film of the same name. The movie has been tainted with controversy since late last year, when Lively filed a lawsuit against Baldoni, in which she accuses him of sexual harassment on the set, as well as creating a smear campaign against her. Baldoni\u2019s $400 million countersuit against Lively and a defamation suit he filed against The New York Times was dismissed in June.",
      "The legal issues have cast a shadow over the movie, while Hoover told Elle magazine in a Nov. 20 article that the matter is \u201cunfortunate\u201d and \u201cdisappointing.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt feels like a circus,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen there are real people involved, with real feelings and emotions. This actually truly has impacted some of the actors\u2019 careers in huge ways. And I just find it all around sad.\u201d",
      "Hoover, who, according to Elle, was prepping to give a deposition at the time she spoke with the magazine, wants to avoid becoming part of the story herself.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just trying to stay removed from the negativity. I have my own story I could tell \u2026 but I don\u2019t want to bring attention to it, and I don\u2019t want to have to put someone else down to lift myself up. So I\u2019d rather just ignore it and let people think and say what they\u2019re going to say,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI feel like it\u2019s so big at this point that there\u2019s nothing anyone can say to change whatever opinion people have of it, even though no one has the actual truth. Not even me.\u201d",
      "A New York judge on Oct. 31 formally ended Baldoni\u2019s countersuit against Lively and the Times when Baldoni and his legal team missed a deadline to file an amended complaint. Attorneys for Lively and Baldoni did not respond to a request for comment from NBC News at the time.",
      "Lively\u2019s lawsuit against Baldoni goes to trial in March 2026.",
      "\u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d centers on florist Lily Bloom (Lively), whose relationship with neurosurgeon Ryle Kincaid (Baldoni, who also directed the film) unfurls into domestic violence, following a pattern of abuse Lily witnessed by her father toward her mother.",
      "The basis of \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d was drawn from Hoover\u2019s mother\u2019s own experience. The author says the controversy takes away from what she has had to endure.",
      "\u201cThe book was inspired by her story, and now it gives us PTSD to think about it,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel awful because I almost feel like she\u2019s gone through more with the aftermath of this film, more pain than she went through with my dad, just seeing the ugliness of it.\u201d",
      "The legal matter between Lively and Baldoni has also changed how Hoover feels about the book.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t even recommend it anymore. I feel like (the lawsuit) has overshadowed it,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m almost embarrassed to say I wrote it. When people ask what I do, I\u2019m just like, \u2018I\u2019m a writer. Please don\u2019t ask me what I wrote.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cThe more time that passes, the easier everything gets for all of us,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut it is sad, because I was very proud of that book. And I\u2019m still proud of it, but less publicly so. Maybe I need therapy, I don\u2019t know.\u201d"

      "The man was identified as Wen, a social media influencer who has in the past stormed stage shows by performers like Katy Perry and The Weeknd. He described himself in a message to NBC News as a \u201cmega fan\u201d of Grande and said he was \u201chappy\u201d to meet her.",
      "Wen was sentenced on Nov. 17 to nine days in jail after pleading guilty to a charge of being a public nuisance.",
      "Grande\u2019s fans pointed out that she has been traumatized at previous events like the 2017 bombing of her concert in Manchester in which 22 people were killed.",
      "\u201cAfter all the trauma Ari has been through, this is beyond disrespectful,\u201d one person commented on a video of the moment posted on Instagram by Wen. \u201cNot just to her, but to the cast and to all the fans. It\u2019s literally infuriating. You should be ashamed.\u201d"

      "How do you solve the case of a college president being blackmailed if every member of the faculty is a suspect? You need a man on the inside. It also helps if that man is a former professor-turned private investigator.",
      "Created by Mike Shur and based the 2020 Chilean documentary \u201cThe Mole Agent,\u201d the Netflix comedic mystery \"Man on the Inside\" follows Charles Nieuwendyk (Ted Danson), an engineering professor who turns to solving mysteries.",
      "In Season 2, out Nov. 20, he investigates a cryptic blackmailer who is threatening Jack Berenger (Max Greenfield), the president of Wheeler College, and the proposed $400 million donation made by billionaire alumni Brad Vinick (Gary Cole).",
      "To complicate matters even further, the detective starts falling for one of his suspects, a vibrant music teacher named Mona (Mary Steenburgen).",
      "After Charles solved the case of a missing ruby necklace at Pacific View Retirement Community in Season 1, he finds himself in an investigative rut. Catching a man having an affair might be interesting the first time around, but after the ninth, Charles is ready to never encounter a cheating man again. That\u2019s why, when he hears about Berenger\u2019s case, he jumps at the chance to go undercover.",
      "As soon as Charles steps foot on the campus of Wheeler College, he assembles a long list of possible suspects, all of whom have a reason to detest the billionaire graduate who is known for flying his dog on a private jet every day from San Francisco to Aspen.",
      "While Charles is busy gathering evidence, his boss Julie (Lilah Richcreek Estrada) must seek help from a precarious source \u2014 who just also happens to be her estranged mother, Vanessa (Constance Marie).",
      "One theme that Shur wanted to examine in \u201cA Man on the Inside\u201d was the need for connection and how the dynamic relationship between adult children and their aging parents evolve over time.",
      "In Season 1, Charles grew distant from his daughter Emily (Mary Elizabeth Ellis) following the death of his wife.",
      "\u201cThey loved each other and were close, but drifted apart because of a tragedy that happened,\u201d Shur tells TODAY.com. Over the course of the first season, Charles learned how to communicate his shared grief with Emily.",
      "That same theme of familial reconciliation can be seen with Julie and her mother. Because Julie never discussed her personal life with Charles, Shur described how this new season was a chance for viewers to get to know Julie and her past.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a reason this woman is a private investigator,\u201d Shur says. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason that she\u2019s so guarded and mistrustful of people \u2014 almost borderline paranoid. We thought, \u2018What if the story is her mom was a con artist and was arrested when she was a kid?\u2019 That explains a lot about that character. But then what if that woman is still in her life in a very tangential way? It was a wonderful story to tell about making amends with a parent.\u201d",
      "While Season 1 explored Charles\u2019 loneliness and heartache after his late wife\u2019s death, Season 2 adds a romantic twist for Charles. Who better to play a love interest opposite Danson than Steenburgen, his actual wife of 30 years?",
      "Speaking with TODAY.com, Danson shared how his character changed because of his newfound relationship with Mona.",
      "\u201cThe fact that you are willing to take a chance at something so vulnerable as opening your heart back up to another person takes courage,\u201d Danson says. \u201cA lot of times, people would rather not risk loss again. They play safe and rock back on their heels. It was exciting for me to play something that I believe is worth putting out in the world, which is to stay curious and go for it because life\u2019s not over.\u201d",
      "Steenburgen and Danson have been married for 30 years, but their characters only came together in their 70s. In one scene, Mona talks about how, at their age, both she and Charles have experienced terrific highs and terrible lows, but she\u2019s learned to not get stuck in the past or worry about the future.

      "However, Kardashian said that she can\u2019t pause her studies because she\u2019s close to finishing her law program, which she completed in May, and is also \u201caddicted to studying.\u201d",
      "\u201cI just look at things differently. I love that my kids see me go to school,\u201d she said in a confessional. \u201cWhen I drop them off at school, they see me go to school.

      "At the beginning of Season 2, 456 players embarked on a journey to win the $4.56 million prize. Along the way, they had to outlast each other in a series of high-stakes children\u2019s games.",
      "The Season 2 finale began on a high note for the five finalists \u2014 Dajah, Perla, Steven, Trinity and Vanessa \u2014 as they enjoyed a well-deserved gourmet dinner while dressed in their finale tuxedos. But the mood quickly shifted as a new game began.",
      "In a move no one saw coming, Trinity graciously sacrificed his own game to allow the other finalists to continue on in the competition. Then things got real. The remaining four contestants had to compete in a game of \"Red Light, Green Light\" with Young-hee, an animatronic doll from the show.",

      "\u201cI think the hardest part for me was obviously in (the) slides and ladders (game), not letting the full Bronx of me come out, and start cooking people verbally. I did a little bit of it, but not too much,\u201d she said, referencing one challenge that turned tense for the contestants.",
      "During the game, another contestant tried to make Perla feel guilty by reminding her she was playing for her son at home. The emotional manipulation didn't sit well with Perla.",
      "\"As an empath, it was really hard because obviously I do care that you have a dream and a reason to be here, but I think it\u2019s very unfair (to act that way). I have a lot of friends in the show that had kids and never threw it in anyone\u2019s face. So it was really tough,\" she said.",

      "\"I knew that production plays games with you, like mental games in the dorms and setting these like little traps. But I think our season, it doubled and then we were constantly being like, 'Is this person doing that because of da da da da? Does he have a coin?'\" she said. \"So the mental games that they play with you in the dorms, it was actually even crazier to experience it than watching it from Season 1.\"",
      "What Will Perla Do With the Money?",
      "After witnessing Perla win the competition, the question on every viewer\u2019s mind is: What\u2019s she going to spend her earnings on?",
      "\u201cI will definitely buy my mom a house. That has been her dream since we all moved to America and it\u2019s really hard to get a house in America. So that would be No. 1,\" she said. \"And then, you know, get a boob job.\""

      "The Texas-born singer, whose full name was Selena Quintanilla P\u00e9rez, found fame singing in both Spanish and English and was known as the Queen of Tejano Music. In March 1995, Selena's life was cut tragically short at age 23 when Yolanda Sald\u00edvar, the former president of her fan club, shot and killed her.",
      "The docuseries, which premiered Nov. 17, explores Selena\u2019s love story with P\u00e9rez, who became a guitarist in her band. Though her father and manager, Abraham Quintanilla, initially objected to the young lovers\u2019 romance, they secretly eloped in April 1992 and were together until Selena\u2019s death.",

      "Who Is Chris P\u00e9rez?",
      "P\u00e9rez played lead guitar in Selena\u2019s band, Selena y Los Dinos. The band also included Selena\u2019s older brother A.B. Quintanilla on bass and sister Suzette Quintanilla on drums, and was managed by the siblings\u2019 father Abraham Quintanilla.",

      "How Did Selena and Chris P\u00e9rez Meet?",
      "P\u00e9rez successfully auditioned for a spot in Selena y Los Dinos in 1990, the Los Angeles Times reported.",
      "When P\u00e9rez, who was already a fan of the band, met Selena in person, he thought she was \u201cbeautiful and talented,\u201d he told  Entertainment Tonight in 2018. \u201cI\u2019m a shy person by nature, and there was something about her that was just able to pull me out,\u201d he said.",
      "The pair\u2019s relationship turned romantic after the band flew to Acapulco, Mexico. While there, P\u00e9rez felt a new closeness and chemistry with the \u201cBidi Bidi Bom Bom\u201d singer, he explained during a 2021 interview on the \u201cAnything for Selena\u201d podcast.",
      "When their plane began experiencing turbulence, Selena took P\u00e9rez\u2019s hand, he recalled. \u201c(I thought), maybe she was just being (a friend), she knows I\u2019m freaking out from the turbulence ... At the same time, I knew there were sparks,\u201d P\u00e9rez said.",
      "P\u00e9rez also recalled worrying about giving into his feelings. \u201cDude, she was like massaging my hand and there I am like, duh, I didn\u2019t know what to think. Add to that, we worked together,\u201d he said.",
      "When Did They Get Married?",
      "The couple initially kept their love affair a secret from Selena\u2019s father but they found it difficult to hide their joy.",
      "\u201cWe were in Laredo when we had our conversation about how we both felt the same way about each other. Selena had the biggest smile on her face when we were walking back to the bus afterward,\u201d P\u00e9rez told Texas Monthly in 2010. \u201cI\u2019m smiling right now just thinking about it. I wanted to tell her, \u2018Hey, quit smiling! You\u2019re going to give it away.\u2019 \u201d",
      "After Abraham Quintanilla found out about the couple\u2019s romance, he kicked P\u00e9rez out of the band despite Selena\u2019s protests.",
      "Selena and P\u00e9rez eloped on April 2, 1992 when Selena was 21, Texas Monthly reported. Abraham Quintanilla told the publication that after P\u00e9rez married his daughter, he \u201caccepted him as part of the family\u201d and allowed him to rejoin Selena\u2019s band. This was also confirmed in \u201cSelena y Los Dinos.\u201d",
      "Following the couple's marriage, Selena began mentioning in public her love for P\u00e9rez. When she accepted the award for female entertainer of the year at the 1993 Tejano Music Awards, she acknowledged their love in her speech.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d like to thank my husband. I love you,\u201d she said.",
      "How Was Chris P\u00e9rez\u2019s Relationship With Selena\u2019s Family After Her Death?",
      "Years after Selena's death, tensions between P\u00e9rez and his father-in-law resurfaced in December 2010 when Abraham Quintanilla sued P\u00e9rez and the media production company Endemol Shine Latino to halt production of a planned Selena bioseries, NBC News reported at the time.",

      "Abraham Quintanilla\u2019s suit stated that his late daughter\u2019s estate, which he controlled, owns \u201call proprietary rights in the name, voice, signature, photograph, and likeness of Selena.\u201d",
      "It further stated, \u201cDefendant P\u00e9rez expressly agreed that he would not exploit any of the Entertainment Properties in any manner or medium, including, without limitation, by way of a book, television series, movie, or any other motion picture medium.\u201d",
      "Five years later, in September 2021, the pair filed a joint motion to dismiss the lawsuit, P\u00e9rez revealed.",
      "\u201cGood news! I have amicably resolved my legal dispute with the Quintanilla family,\u201d he tweeted at the time. \u201cNow that these issues are behind us, going forward, my hope, and the hope of the Quintanilla family, is for us to work together to continue to honor and celebrate the legacy of Selena.\u201d",
      "P\u00e9rez, who appears alongside Selena\u2019s family members in the \u201cSelena y Los Dinos\u201d docuseries, has remained close to his sister-in-law and former bandmate Suzette Quintanilla.",
      "The two posed together under a mural of Selena last month in Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cLike everything, family has disagreements about certain things, but we\u2019re past that,\u201d Suzette Quintanilla told E! News this month during a joint interview with P\u00e9rez. \u201cI will always consider Chris family, and I know that he feels the same way about me, and that\u2019s it.\u201d",
      "She added, \u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019re family. We have each other\u2019s back.\u201d",
      "What Has Chris P\u00e9rez Said Recently About Selena?",
      "P\u00e9rez told People in November 2025 that 30 years after his late wife's tragic death, she is always on his mind.",
      "\u201cI think about Selena every day,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m making a decision, I can hear her in my head, like, \u2018I don\u2019t know \u2014 are you sure you wanna do that?\u2019",
      "The guitarist said the love he shared with Selena is still precious to him.",
      "\u201cAs time has gone on, you romanticize it even more,\u201d he said. \u201cThe love story is a big part of her legacy. My most prized possessions are her love letters.\u201d He reads one of her letters in \u201cSelena y Los Dinos.\u201d",
      "He added in his People interview that the pain of Selena\u2019s death still haunts him.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m Chris before all of that happened, and Chris after,\u201d he explained. \u201cShe\u2019s a part of both sides. I\u2019ve lived with her presence in thoughts and feelings and music. That\u2019s become my new normal. But I can\u2019t watch the end of the documentary about her death. It\u2019s just difficult.\u201d",
      "What Does Chris P\u00e9rez Say About Selena in \u2018Selena y Los Dinos\u2019?",
      "In the Netflix documentary, P\u00e9rez says he was \u201cstarstruck\u201d when he met Selena and her band.",
      "\u201cThe honest truth was I was just more taken aback by the power of the band and the music and the sound,\u201d he said, before touching on his early relationship with Selena. \u201cAt first, we didn\u2019t hang out too much. Selena was always either off with Suzette or her mom.\u201d",
      "He credited the long tour bus trips to them becoming friends.",
      "\u201cAnytime we were next to each other, it would just be me and her talking about music and movies and things like that,\u201d he said, admiring how it was \u201ccool seeing her being a normal person.\u201d",
      "P\u00e9rez also commented on Selena\u2019s \u201cvulnerable side,\u201d as well as spoke about their trip to Mexico as a band when he started to have stronger feelings for her.",
      "He recalled their first kiss, as well as when their bandmate Ricky Vela walked in on them. P\u00e9rez also said he was \u201cgenuinely in fear\u201d of Selena\u2019s father and what he would say.",
      "\u201cBut what we had going with each other, I didn\u2019t want to jeopardize that at all,\u201d he said.",
      "P\u00e9rez also reads a letter Selena wrote to him before they got married and recalls the moment her dad got upset with him when he found out about their relationship.",
      "Selena\u2019s widow also touches on the day he found out she died.",
      "\u201cI do miss her a lot. But today, I\u2019m very proud of what she represents and the small part that I might play in that story,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "It wasn't until her junior year of college that Nia Sioux realized she was ready.",
      "Then a student at UCLA, she was in Los Angeles with her mom, Holly Frazier. She remembers looking at her and saying, \"I'm ready to write it.\"",
      "She was referring to her long-planned dream of writing a memoir about her time on the Lifetime reality show \"Dance Moms.\" Nia  was just 9 years old in the show's pilot. She and her mom, Holly Frazier, starred in it for seven seasons, from 2011 to 2017.",
      "That dream was actualized with the release of \"Bottom of the Pyramid: A Memoir of Persevering, Dancing for Myself, and Starring in My Own Life,\" which hit shelves Nov. 4.",
      "\"I always knew I was going to write a book about my time on 'Dance Moms,'\" Nia tells TODAY.com. \"But it's ever really been the right time. It never really felt right. I don't even think I was really comfortable talking about everything that happened on the show. I was still processing it.\"",
      "The book opens with her casting on the show, and each chapter unveils her side of some of the show's controversial moments, often with her dance teacher and the show's star, Abby Lee Miller, at the center of it. She alleges Miller made racist comments directed at her, tried to bribe a mentor to not work with Nia and most recently, refused Nia's request to visit Miller in the hospital to clear the air after she was diagnosed with cancer. (TODAY.com has reached out to Miller for comment.)",
      "Speaking with TODAY.com after the publication of the memoir, Nia confirms she hasn't heard from Miller about the book.",
      "\"I don't plan on getting anything either,\" Nia says. \"Yeah, no.\"",
      "But bringing that to light isn\u2019t why Nia wrote the book. In the memoir, she writes that after her request to meet was declined, she\u2019ll \u201cnever reach out to Abby Lee Miller again.\u201d She adds that she \u201cdidn\u2019t even want to use her name\u201d in the book.",
      "\"After I had a lot of space away from the show, I realized that that woman really does not have power over me. She really can't dictate my life and control things, and for so long, she made it seem like she controlled the world and she controlled my future,\" Nia says. \"I think having that space away from the show and realizing, like, oh my gosh, actually, she doesn't exist in my world. I can do my own thing and be successful ... and she's not going to get in the way of that.\"",
      "The book seeks to establish Nia as the \"star in my life.\"",
      "Its overarching theme is ironically best described by the title. The bottom of the pyramid, of course, refers to \"Dance Moms'\" episode's fixture in which Miller would rank each dancer in a tiered pyramid based on their performance at their most recent competition.",
      "Fans of the show may remember that typically Nia was toward the bottom, while the coveted top of the pyramid spot was most often dominated by Maddie Ziegler.",
      "\"My dad, at first, was a little concerned. He loved the title, but he also was concerned with it, because I've been trying to kind of shed that title my whole life,\" Nia says. \"So he was like, 'Why would you name your book \"Bottom of the Pyramid\"? Isn't that kind of putting yourself down?'",
      "\"I was like, 'No, it's basically me just reclaiming that title and turning it into a positive,'\" she adds.",
      "For example, she writes in the book, as the bottom of the pyramid she served as her team's base, its glue. And \"at the bottom, the only place you can go is up.\"",
      "\"I'm not shying away from it. I'm not embarrassed by it. I'm just ready to talk,\" she tells TODAY.com.",
      "But that doesn't mean it was easy. She says the most difficult part was \"trying to tell my story\" while \"not trying to put other people down.\"",
      "\"Anytime I do bring up the girls and situations, I think that part was the hardest for me to write because I never want to paint them in a bad light,\" she says. \"But it's still my experience, and it's still very valid.",
      "\"My relationship with the show was very complicated,\" she adds. \"Although there were times where it was really negative and really challenging, at the same time, it's how I got my start. It's something that is a part of me, and it's something I'm still grateful for, with the good and the bad.\"",
      "Below, Nia discusses how she approached writing the memoir, how some of her fellow castmates have reacted and why the book feels like \"closure\" for the \"Dance Moms\" chapter of her life.",
      "This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.",
      "The hardest part for me was making sure that I wrote everything in the way that I wanted it to be taken. I think that it's really difficult to talk about these sort of things because I come from a place of, you know, I'm healed. I always lead with love. At the same time, I'm not trying to put people down or badmouth anybody. So, trying to find that delicate balance between sharing my story, but (I'm) still not here to protect people. People have been protected this whole time. It was time for me to share my story. And I think that was the hardest part for me, is being OK sharing my story without being worried about what other people thought.",
      "I always knew that I endured a lot. But I feel like every time I read through the book to make my edits and add things, omit things, every single time something came up. Every single time I think I cried in different moments. It's really healing to see your whole story as something tangible, as a book. Literally reading your whole life \u2014\u00a0it's very therapeutic. It's basically my diary; it's like my journal. But it's been so healing. And I think that's the thing that I was so surprised about. It did bring up emotions. I was like, you know what, this might be hard for me to write, and there were times that were hard to write, but for the most part, it was just so healing.",
      "I did. Not every single episode, but the parts that I talk about in the book, I watched it back. I remember things a certain way, and I know how things went down, but I also needed to see how they played out on television to see what the world saw. Sometimes it was the same thing that I remembered. ... But there were a lot of things also that I remember that did happen that the show either cut out or they clipped a certain way.",
      "That was kind of weird, because in my head, I'm like, \"Oh, I thought people knew this.\" I thought it played out this way, but actually, they didn't show any of the stuff I actually went through that week. So watching it back, I mean, I did honestly get irritated at times. I'm like, \"Oh my goodness, they didn't show any of that.\" Watching it, what, 14, 13 years later, having that realization is kind of crazy.",
      "I think I watched the first few episodes of it. When it first came out we had our launch party. ... We watched the first episode when it came on, and I think maybe I probably watched the next couple.",
      "But if I'm being honest, no. One because I don't want to re-live that, I know what happens. But then also, too, I honestly really couldn't. We had no time to even watch anything. The time that the show came out, Tuesdays at 9, we literally had dance. I was at dance while the show was coming out. I would get home and the credits would be rolling. So yeah, even if I wanted to, I couldn't, really.",
      "Chloe did read it before it came out, but I didn't really talk to anyone else about the book before I announced that I was doing it. Chloe was my main girl for that because I knew that she would one, be understanding, and also I really wanted her to write the forward. And she was so excited about it. It was a very special moment when I asked her. I had her obviously read the book before she committed to writing the forward as well. Because, of course, I wanted her to be comfortable with what she was endorsing. She's been so great during this whole process, and I'm really proud of her. And I also know that she's proud of me, and it's been a very special journey.",
      "My mom, actually both my parents, would read chapters as they were done. Any parts I had done, I would have my parents read it, because I value their opinion a lot. They watched every episode and they were the adults, so they would probably remember more than me at times, and then remind me of things. That really helped, trying to get different points of view, making sure that I don't forget the little things.",
      "The book definitely feels like closure. I think before I wrote the book, I had definitely moved on. But I don't know if I really had closure with it because I had never talked about my experience. Not many people actually heard from me when it came to \"Dance Moms.\" So this really was healing. This really was closure. And I also say, this book is also a love letter to my younger self.",
      "Honestly, I feel like there hasn't been a ton from the cast members, reaction-wise. So I don't know whether that's good or bad, but like, I haven't seen too much about that. But I'm grateful for the people that have supported me. Grateful for my mom continuing to support me, grateful for Chloe.",
      "... Having her support means the absolute world because I know that I don't have support from everyone. So it's nice to have somebody, especially Chloe, be so supportive of my story.",
      "Well, my biggest dream is one, to help people. That's what I feel like is my mission, just to help people in any way I can. But also I'm a performer at the end of the day, so storytelling, in any way possible, whether that's through dance, music, acting, theater. Theater was my first love besides dance. So hopefully \u2014 well, not hopefully, I am \u2014\u00a0I'm going to dive back into all of those things.",
      "Now that I'm done with college and now I'm done writing the book and it's released now, I can finally focus on getting back into the swing of things. Before I went to college, I was kind of on a roll, and then I went to college, COVID happened, the actors strike happened. So a lot of things have changed within the past five years. So I'm excited to get back to it. I've been craving getting back to performing, getting back on stage, in any capacity."

      "Susan Powter was the face of \u201990s fitness, a high-energy presence in a platinum blond buzzcut urging America to abandon the fad diets and \u201cstop the insanity!\u201d",
      "Her infomercials were ubiquitous as she built a fitness empire worth tens of millions of dollars and released three bestselling books. She was a wellness influencer decades before that was a term, regularly chatting it up with David Letterman and Jay Leno on late-night television.",
      "Then she disappeared for 30 years.",
      "Powter, 67, is now sharing her story of going from fitness fame to living paycheck to paycheck as an Uber Eats driver in Las Vegas.",
      "Her journey is captured in the new documentary \u201cStop the Insanity: Finding Susan Powter,\u201d directed by Zeberiah Newman and executive produced by Jamie Lee Curtis. It will be released Nov. 19 in select theaters and on demand.",
      "\u201cEverything has changed, and I\u2019ll tell you why,\u201d Powter told Savannah Guthrie and Craig Melvin in exclusive TODAY interview on Nov. 18. \u201cBecause I have hope \u2014 real hope. Possibility. Real possibility. And I\u2019m proud that I survived. I didn\u2019t think my being would make it. I didn\u2019t think my energy would survive.",
      "\u201cMy teeth didn\u2019t. The skin looks different. My face looks different,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut Jamie Lee is the one who said to me, \u2018You are alive. You survived.\u2019\u201d",
      "The Australia native, who moved to the U.S. when she was 10, rose to fame after she developed her own fitness regimen following weight gain after a divorce. The classes she taught at a local gym in Dallas became the fuel for an infomercial and fitness empire.",
      "However, at the height of her earning power in the mid-1990s, she says a combination of bad business deals, lawsuits and a second divorce resulted in her declaring personal bankruptcy in 1995.",
      "\u201cI take full responsibility,\u201d Powter said on TODAY. \u201cI never checked. I never said, \u2018Where\u2019s the money?\u2019 So it\u2019s not that there was no money. ... There was a little bit of money, but not the amount of money that was generated. And I just walked away. I literally walked away. I did it very intentionally.\u201d",
      "She says in the documentary that a fitness business that at one point was millions per year never resulted in the money ending up in her bank account.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t running my company. It was a 50/50 deal,\u201d she says in the film. \u201cThere was nothing but lawsuits in the \u201990s. Yes, there was money, but I never had $300 million in the bank account. I never made the money that I generated.\u201d",
      "After declaring bankruptcy, she moved to Seattle to raise her three children as a single mother. Powter struggled to find consistent work as she got older.",
      "\u201cNothing is beneath me,\u201d she said on TODAY. \u201cI will work, I will do anything. ... Broke is one thing, broken is another. It started to break me.\u201d",
      "At one point, she lived in an RV before being forced out of a campground in 2018 and into a weekly rental apartment complex in a crime-ridden area of Las Vegas.",
      "She has little furniture in her current apartment, saying on TODAY that her bed stand is a cardboard box. She survives on Social Security checks and money from delivering food for Uber Eats.",
      "She maintains a strong relationship with her sons, who helped her raise the money to move into her latest apartment.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re very proud of me because I\u2019ll work,\u201d she said on TODAY.",
      "The documentary shows how an automobile breakdown and a dental emergency immediately saps any savings she has been able to scrape together.",
      "\u201cYou are walking back from having spent the whole day at a welfare office,\u201d she says while crying in the film. \u201cAnd you\u2019re walking back to the welfare weekly that you live in.\u201d",
      "Through it all, Powter has tried to remain optimistic.",
      "\u201cI think something\u2019s shifting,\u201d she says in the documentary. \u201cThe fear, the poverty, the hopelessness. It\u2019s this tsunami of what was, what happened, the truth. I\u2019m betting the farm on me.\u201d",
      "With the release of the new film, Powter is looking toward the future.",
      "\u201cI want to be able to do what I\u2019ve done once before, which was miraculous in and of itself,\u201d she said on TODAY. \u201cAnd this time it would be properly managed. ... I want to do my work, and I want to have a chance.\u201d"

      "The two women moved to Italy in the \u201860s and posed on the cover of the Italian edition of Playboy. They acted in various European film productions throughout the decade and briefly appeared in the Hollywood biblical epic \u201cSodom and Gomorrah.\u201d",
      "The sisters ultimately moved back to Germany in the \u201880s, settling in a home near Munich. They never married.",

      "Ukraine and its allies on the continent have been frozen out of talks between Washington and Moscow before, and there was conflicting information about whether they were involved this time.",
      "A senior U.S. official told NBC News on Thursday that Ukraine had been part of the discussions about the plan.",
      "\u201cThis plan was drawn up immediately following discussions with one of the most senior members of President [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy\u2019s administration, Rustem Umerov, who agreed to the majority of the plan, after making several modifications, and presented it to President Zelenskyy,\" the senior U.S. official said.",
      "Zelenskyy\u2019s office said he had \u201creceived a draft plan from the American side\u201d in a statement on Telegram.",
      "After a meeting with U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll on Thursday, Zelenskyy said there would be \u201cconstructive, honest and swift work\u201d on an effort to end the war, while the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv said on X that \u201cmomentum is finally on the side of peace.\u201d",
      "No details about the plan have been officially released. A source familiar with the matter told NBC News that the 28-point plan reported by Axios on Thursday is accurate. It is currently in draft mode but reflects where the parties stand at the moment, according to the source.",
      "\u201cIt reflects both Russian and Ukrainian feedback,\u201d the source said.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt pushed back Thursday at reports that the terms of the plan are favorable to Russia and maintained that Ukraine had been consulted on it.",
      "She said that Trump had grown \u201cincreasingly frustrated\u201d with both countries but that they had been engaged \u201cequally\u201d as Trump\u2019s envoy, Steve Witkoff, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio worked on the proposals.",
      "Mike Waltz, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, noted on Thursday that the U.S. had put in a lot of effort to stop the conflict.",
      "\"The United States has invested at the highest levels, the president of the United States personally, to end this war. We have proposed generous terms for Russia, including sanctions relief. We have asked Russia to halt its attacks and meet directly with Ukraine to negotiate a peaceful settlement,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, the fighting continues, tragically causing more civilian casualties.\"",
      "He added, \"We can impose further economic costs if Russia continues to ignore calls for a ceasefire. We will also continue to make weapons available for Ukraine\u2019s defense.\"",
      "But the swirling sense that the plan may resemble a Russian wish list threatened a nightmare scenario for Ukraine at a moment of particular peril, with its government mired in a corruption scandal and its military struggling to hold off damaging battlefield setbacks.",
      "Zelenskyy has come under intense pressure this week from his political opponents, who are extremely wary of any deal that would necessitate the country\u2019s capitulation.",
      "\u201cI am not entirely sure who has actually worked on this particular plan,\u201d opposition lawmaker Vadym Ivanchenko said in an interview. \u201cNo one has presented it officially or explained the logic behind its points.\u201d The points being discussed in the media, he said, appear to \u201cbe at odds with Ukraine\u2019s interests.\u201d",
      "The U.S. official who spoke to NBC News about the plan said that both Russian and Ukrainian officials were involved in the discussions, but that was at odds with a source close to the Ukrainian government and a European official with knowledge of the matter.",
      "The U.S. official also confirmed reports that Keith Kellogg, the special envoy to Ukraine who had been widely seen as closer to Kyiv, is expected to step down at the end of the year.",
      "The Kremlin has meanwhile remained noncommittal on peace plans.",
      "\u201cIs it true or not?\u201d Sergei Markov, a commentator and a former adviser to President Vladimir Putin, told NBC News about whether a deal had been struck. \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "In Kyiv, the timing of the plan was viewed as no coincidence, the source close to the Ukrainian government said, most likely an attempt by the Kremlin to take full advantage at an acutely challenging time: Not only do the drones keep falling on its cities, but Russian forces also appear poised to overrun the strategic town of Pokrovsk, a key battlefield victory that could open up the rest of Ukraine\u2019s Donbas heartland to the Russian war machine \u2014 if it isn\u2019t dealt away under pressure from Washington.",
      "Meanwhile, Zelenskyy has been rocked by a $100 million corruption scandal implicating one of his close associates, senior government officials and the country\u2019s vital state-run energy company. He also faces pressure to fire his all-powerful chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, often seen as the power behind the throne.",
      "Ivanchenko, a lawmaker for the Batkivshchyna political party led by former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, conceded that \u201cwe find ourselves in a somewhat vulnerable position.\u201d",
      "It is \u201cnot a catastrophe, not a defeat,\u201d he said. \u201cBut also not the position of strength in which we would ideally enter any negotiations.\u201d",
      "Asked Wednesday whether \u201conly\u201d Trump can end this war, European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas gave a blunt \u201cno.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn order to end this war, you need the Ukrainians and the Europeans to agree to those plans,\u201d she told reporters. A succession of European foreign ministers, meeting with Kallas in Brussels, expressed caution but made it clear they wouldn\u2019t allow Kyiv to be forced into capitulation.",
      "Ukrainian officials have little choice, in public at least, to be positive about U.S. efforts \u2014 Zelenskyy found that out the hard way through an Oval Office humiliation by Trump. Since then, a series of summits and meetings have seen Trump appear to waver between favoring Russia or Ukraine and then slipping back again.",
      "\u201cI have a good relationship with President Putin, but I\u2019m a little disappointed in President Putin right now. He knows that,\u201d Trump sad at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum on Wednesday.",
      "Rubio struck a balanced tone on X, saying that a \u201cdurable peace will require both sides to agree to difficult but necessary concessions.\u201d",
      "Alyona Getmanchuk, Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to NATO, said in an interview Wednesday that Trump\u2019s \u201cdetermination to seek a solid diplomatic solution is truly commendable.\u201d Nevertheless, she cautioned, \u201cwhat is crucial for Ukraine is that any peace plan respects our sovereignty and territorial integrity and prevents future Russian attacks, ensuring that Ukraine is not made an easy target for the next round of aggression.\u201d",
      "Indeed, it\u2019s not just Ukrainians who find the proposals alarming. Many European governments see the idea of ceding territory to Russia and placing future limits on Ukraine\u2019s capacity to defend itself as not only rewarding Putin\u2019s aggression, but also emboldening him to strike elsewhere in Europe.",
      "That\u2019s why the reported terms of Trump\u2019s plan create \u201can extremely dangerous international precedent,\u201d according to Danylo Metelskyi, the director of the Center of Social Transformations, a nongovernmental organization based in Kyiv. \u201cIf territories seized by force remain under the control of the aggressor state, it undermines the entire postwar global order.\u201d",
      "Russia\u2019s position in all of it doesn\u2019t appear to have changed at all: It is still demanding \u201cthe elimination of the root causes of this conflict,\u201d as Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Thursday. That is: Ukraine should cede territory, weaken its military and promise never to join NATO.",
      "Russian officials have \u201cto navigate between their maximalist objectives\u201d and not risking Trump\u2019s \u201csupporting Ukraine more than ever,\u201d said longtime Moscow watcher James Nixey, an independent consultant based in England. \u201cSo it\u2019s tricky for the Russians, too. They don\u2019t know how far they can push \u2014 but they\u2019re sure as hell trying.\u201d",
      "The question now is: Will this \u201cgo the way of previous attempts at a peace process? Rejected by Ukraine and Europe,\u201d Nixey added. \u201cOr will the pressure \u2014 battlefield pressure, societal pressure, U.S. pressure \u2014 be too much for Ukraine and it has to de facto surrender? Because that is what this is.\u201d",

      "Ibrahim told CNN that his father, originally from Boca Raton, Florida, was arriving in Philadelphia on Thursday, crediting the Trump administration for his release.",
      "\"This day would not have been possible without President Donald Trump and the tireless efforts of his administration,\" the family said in a statement, also thanking Trump official Sebastian Gorka.",
      "\"No American Left Behind. That is President @realDonaldTrump\u2019s promise from Day One. @WhiteHouse,\u201d Gorka said, reposting the family statement.",
      "The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Trump has touted his dealmaking abilities, having freed several Americans imprisoned in other countries, including six Americans from Venezuela and others from Russia, Afghanistan and Belarus.",
      "Almadi's release came as Trump bolstered U.S. ties with Saudi Arabia, the once deeply conservative, oil-dependent theocracy that the 40-year-old crown prince is trying to transform into a modern and more moderate global power.",
      "Trump was attending a Saudi investment conference in Washington as the news that Almadi was free emerged.",
      "Almadi, a retired project manager who immigrated to the United States in the 1970s, had written over a dozen tweets critical of the Riyadh government.",
      "He was arrested in November 2021 during a visit to Saudi Arabia for a medical procedure and sentenced to prison on terrorism-related charges.",
      "The kingdom freed him after more than a year in prison, dropped his charges to \"cyber crimes\" and prevented him from leaving the country until next March.",
      "One of the tweets Saudi authorities confronted Almadi over discussed the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, his family has said.",
      "His early release comes after Trump defended the crown prince over the murder of Khashoggi, the Washington Post columnist, disavowing the findings by his own intelligence agencies and telling reporters in the Oval Office that the crown prince \u201cknew nothing about it.\u201d",
      "The CIA concluded that he had ordered the killing.",
      "The crown prince has cracked down on internal criticism, with human rights defenders inside and outside the country warning about unfair trials, arbitrary arrests and executions.",
      "While Almadi may have been released, hundreds of people remain jailed or detained in the kingdom, including journalists, activists, scholars and aid workers, human rights groups say.",
      "Crown Prince Mohammed has worked hard to repair his country's image on the global stage, pressing his modernization drive while wielding the kingdom\u2019s power as the world\u2019s largest oil producer and a growing diplomatic player.",
      "On Tuesday, he made his first visit to the White House since the murder and received an elaborate welcome that included a military flyover and an honor guard on horseback \u2014 as well as Trump's rhetorical defense.",
      "Despite the crown prince's success in partially modernizing Saudi society and the economy, the country of 33 million people remains a monarchy where expressing dissent can be dangerous.",
      "Asked about Khashoggi's murder Tuesday, the crown prince promised that \u201cwe are doing our best that this doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been painful for us in Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said."

      "LONDON \u2014 A former United Nations investigator who wrote the authoritative report on the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi told NBC News on Wednesday that she was \u201cshocked and angry\u201d at President Donald Trump\u2019s dismissal of intelligence saying Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman approved the killing.",
      "Agn\u00e8s Callamard, the secretary general of the watchdog Amnesty International, said there was \u201cno doubt whatsoever\u201d that the crown prince ordered Khashoggi\u2019s grisly bone-saw killing inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul in 2018. American intelligence said that the crown prince personally approved the operation to kill or kidnap the Washington Post columnist, something the de facto Saudi leader has denied despite apologizing for the murder by his officials.",
      "As the Saudi leader visited the White House on Tuesday, Trump disavowed the findings by his own intelligence agencies, saying the crown prince \u201cknew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that,\u201d even chiding the enquiring reporter for trying to \u201cembarrass our guests by asking a question like that.\u201d",
      "Trump called Khashoggi \u201cextremely controversial\u201d and claimed that \u201ca lot of people didn\u2019t like that gentleman that you\u2019re talking about.\u201d He added, \u201cWhether you like him or didn\u2019t like him, things happen.\u201d",
      "The remarks surprised Callamard, who while serving as the U.N. special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary killings investigated Khashoggi\u2019s murder and in 2019 wrote arguably the most detailed and authoritative report about what happened.",
      "\u201cI was astonished, shocked and angry,\u201d Callamard said of Trump's comments. \u201cWhat\u2019s controversial is flying 15 operatives from Saudi Arabia to a foreign country to commit a murder.\u201d",
      "There is \u201cno doubt whatsoever\u201d that Crown Prince Mohammed ordered Khashoggi\u2019s murder, she maintained. \u201cAnd frankly, there is no doubt in the mind of anyone who knows Saudi Arabia.\u201d",
      "Trump's remarks have provoked widespread outrage.",
      "Khashoggi\u2019s widow, Hanan Elatr Khashoggi, told Reuters that she wished Trump could meet \u201cthe real Jamal,\u201d and that nothing can \u201cjustify just a horrible crime.\u201d.",
      "The Washington Post called \u201cTrump\u2019s performance at the White House \u2026 weak, crass and of no strategic benefit to America.\u201d And the National Press Club warned the remarks would have \u201creal-world consequences,\u201d including emboldening authoritarian states that \u201cwish to silence reporters.\"",
      "NBC News has contacted the White House and the Saudi Embassy in London for a response to the criticisms contained in this story.",
      "Some Middle East analysts say that despite the global outrage, Trump\u2019s comments reflect his desire to build on the deep economic ties between Washington and Riyadh.",
      "During the Saudi leader\u2019s visit this week, Trump announced he would sell the crown prince F-35 fighter jets, treating his guest to a flyover of the high-tech planes, as well as a gunfire salute.",
      "Saudi Arabia is the world\u2019s largest buyer of American weapons. In May, the U.S. announced it was selling the Gulf state almost $142 billion of \u201cstate-of-the-art warfighting equipment and services,\u201d part of a wider $600 billion investment package.",
      "Despite the lavish welcome, Trump did not appear to make headway on his wish for Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords, a group of Arab nations that have recognized the state of Israel. The crown prince told the Oval Office he did not want to sign anything \u201cuntil we secure a clear path of two-state solution\u201d for Palestinians.",
      "Trump has \u201calways been pretty clear that the relationship with Saudi Arabia is important to him and that he gets on with Mohammed bin Salman,\u201d said Michael Stephens, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a think tank based in London. \u201cI suspect Trump did not want the trip to be derailed.\u201d",
      "Noting past controversial statements from Trump \u2014 including calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a \u201cdictator,\u201d before retracting it \u2014 Stephens said such remarks should be taken with a \u201cpinch of salt.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat I view this as is relationship management, making sure that Saudi Arabia and [bin Salman] feel personally supported by Trump,\u201d he said.",
      "The crown prince himself called Khashoggi\u2019s killing \u201cpainful\u201d and a \u201chuge mistake\u201d Tuesday, while offering little encouragement other than a polite smile to Trump\u2019s overtures.",
      "He said his kingdom had taken \u201call the right steps of investigation\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019ve improved our system to be sure that nothing\u201d similar happens again.",
      "Indeed, the crown prince has been attempting to transform the kingdom from a conservative, oil-rich theocracy into a major economic power built on business, tourism, entertainment and sports.",
      "There have been some reforms, including removing the requirement for women to wear headscarves in public, allowing them to drive and to attend soccer matches.",
      "Saudi authorities have worked hard to wash away the anger over human rights abuses and the killing of Khashoggi, who was lured into the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul to obtain a document, before being killed and dismembered by the 15-member Saudi team waiting there. His remains have never been recovered.",
      "A 2021 report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence cited \"the direct involvement of a key adviser and members of Muhammad bin Salman's protective detail in the operation\" and concluded it was \"highly unlikely that Saudi officials would have carried out an operation of this nature without the Crown Prince's authorization.\"",
      "The kingdom still has an \u201cabysmal human rights record,\u201d according to Human Rights Watch, crushing political dissent and executing at least 300 people this year.",
      "Presenting Crown Prince Mohammed as \"a beacon or an icon of modernity for his country is a joke,\" Callamard said, calling the kingdom's reforms \"very superficial.\"",
      "She noted that Trump was merely \"the latest in a succession of global leaders who have normalized and legitimized Mohammed bin Salman within the international community and the international context.\"",
      "While he was a presidential candidate, Joe Biden called the kingdom a \u201cpariah,\u201d only to receive widespread criticism in 2022 for traveling to Saudi Arabia and fist-bumping the crown prince, an incident derided by Trump on Tuesday.",
      "\"Saudi Arabia is being acknowledged because of its geostrategic interest, because of its oil resources, because of the fact that it is key to any attempt of bringing peace to the Middle East,\" she said. \"I don't see that as a recognition of [Crown Prince Mohammed] as anything other than a killer.\""

    "story": [
      "Meta announced Thursday that it will close the Instagram and Facebook accounts of Australian users under age 16 early next month as the country\u2019s landmark social media ban begins to take effect.",
      "The California-based tech giant said it had begun notifying affected users to download their contacts and memories before their accounts are deleted from its platforms, starting from Dec. 4, sparking concerns about potential privacy violations and shrinking spaces for young people.",
      "The world-first law comes as lawmakers across the globe wrestle with the impacts of teens\u2019 internet access, with the European Union also considering age restrictions on social media use, while the U.K. has imposed mandatory age checks for sites likely to contain adult content.",
      "Australia has earned a reputation for confrontations with Silicon Valley giants, with a past showdown forcing tech companies to pay for news content used on social media. The country has also weighed rules punishing tech giants for spreading misinformation, and has rejected calls for AI-friendly changes to copyright law.",
      "Meta said in a statement Thursday that it would kick off users it understands to be under the age of 16 using \u201cage assurance methods\u201d by Dec. 10, when Australia\u2019s new law comes into effect. Teenage users can have their access restored once they turn 16, the company said.",
      "TikTok, X, Snapchat and Reddit are also set to be age-restricted under the law, according to a list shared by Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner agency, while YouTube will restrict underage users to a child-friendly version.",
      "Messaging apps like Meta\u2019s WhatsApp and Messenger platforms are excluded from the ban.",
      "Meta said that accurately determining a user\u2019s age would prove \u201ca challenge for the entire industry,\u201d stressing that Australian authorities recognize the likelihood of \u201cnatural error margins.\u201d",
      "Users above 16 who are mistakenly affected can verify their age by uploading a government-issued ID or a video selfie, similar to the age check tools already rolled out in the U.K.",
      "Australian lawmakers cited the impact of excessive use on children\u2019s physical and mental health as they pushed through the law cutting off social media access to under-16s last year. A YouGov poll last year found that 77% of Australians supported the legislation.",
      "Under the ban, social media platforms bear sole responsibility for enforcement, with systemic failures punishable by fines of up to $33 million.",
      "About 96% of children ages 10 to 15 in Australia have used social media, according to a July report by the eSafety Commissioner. Nearly 350,000 Australian kids ages 13-15 use Instagram, official data showed.",
      "Earlier this month, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he is \u201cconfident\u201d that the ban will be \u201csuccessful,\u201d defending it as an \u201cappropriate government response\u201d to demands from parents rather than a top-down order.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the history of social change for common good,\u201d Albanese told Australian public broadcaster ABC News. \u201cThis will empower parents to talk with their kids.\u201d",
      "However, experts have voiced concerns about the practicality and possible harms that may arise.",
      "Meta will use AI tools to estimate the age of existing users, possibly leading to errors and misidentification, said Rahat Masood, a senior cybersecurity lecturer at the University of New South Wales in Sydney.",
      "Signals such as a user\u2019s likes and interests \u201chelp the platform \u2018guess\u2019 a user\u2019s age, but they are never 100% accurate,\u201d Masood said, especially given that adolescents are the \u201chardest age group to estimate accurately,\u201d as their demographic cues are \u201cnot stable.\u201d",
      "Australian authorities have \u201cno transparent framework\u201d for auditing tech companies\u2019 age verification systems and there is a \u201creal risk of privacy violations,\u201d Masood said.",
      "Many teenagers will look for workarounds such as VPNs to set up accounts in other countries or will use borrowed accounts, said Faith Gordon, an associate professor at the Australian National University\u2019s School of Law.",
      "\u201cThe greater concern is that some teenagers may drift toward far less regulated corners of the internet, including encrypted networks or the dark web, simply to stay connected,\u201d Gordon said.",
      "\u201cThese spaces carry significantly higher risks, from exposure to harmful content to exploitation, and they are far harder for parents, educators and regulators to monitor and keep track of,\u201d she added.",
      "Andrew K. Przybylski, a professor of human behavior and technology at the University of Oxford, said he hopes the rest of the world won\u2019t follow in the footsteps of Australia in issuing an \u201coutright ban\u201d of social media for young people.",

      "\u201cI am not waiting until our kids turn 16 to use social media,\u201d he added. \u201cKids need our advice, guidance and feedback. They\u2019re way more likely to fully engage with us before\u200b they turn 16.\u201d"

      "LONDON \u2014 Shaken by a scandal that saw King Charles III heckled in the streets before banishing his brother, the British royal family finally has some good news: Princess Kate is back.",
      "Consistently rated one of Britain\u2019s most popular royals, Kate appears to have eased into a fuller return to public duties this week.",
      "She made her first in-person speech Monday since she shared her cancer diagnosis 18 months ago.",
      "\u201cThe love we feel in our earliest years fundamentally shapes who we become and how we thrive as adults,\u201d Kate said, addressing business leaders at the Future Workforce Summit in London about the importance of early childhood, a cause she has championed for years.",
      "\u201cLove is the first and most essential bond.\u201d",
      "The princess has made a growing number of public appearances since she announced this year that her cancer was in remission, but the speech appears to bring her back into the royal fold more permanently.",
      "\"Welcome back, Princess,\" beamed the Daily Telegraph front page.",
      "She drew more positive coverage after a further appearance Wednesday evening for one of the most joyful events on the royal calendar, the annual Royal Variety Performance, telling well-wishers it was \u201cso nice to be back\u201d at the event, according to British media.",
      "She returns after weeks of torrid headlines for the family, with the king stripping his brother Andrew of his princely title last month amid growing scrutiny over his ties to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\u201cWhat you see and hear about Catherine is the monarchy doing the sort of work that it should be doing today,\u201d said Craig Prescott, who teaches law at Royal Holloway, University of London, and specializes in the constitutional and political role of the monarchy.",
      "He told NBC News that the speech focusing on early childhood was a \u201cgood moment\u201d for the family, reflective of its role taking on \u201cinteresting but not directly political causes.\u201d",
      "The focus has been on anything but the family\u2019s normal load of public engagements and ribbon cutting in recent years as the royals have endured a stream of uncertainty and upheaval since Queen Elizabeth II's death in 2022.",
      "The royal family was shaken early last year by the announcement that Charles, then 75, had been diagnosed with cancer after just two years on the throne, for which he is still undergoing treatment.",
      "Relations with the media were then undercut by a damaging saga when Kate, then largely absent from the public eye, admitted having altered a family photo released by the palace. Weeks later, Kate announced her diagnosis and said she was undergoing chemotherapy.",
      "The king has also been working to heal a rift with his son Prince Harry, who stepped down from his royal duties in 2020. They met for a private tea in September, their first meeting in almost two years; William was not present.",
      "It was the king\u2019s younger brother Andrew who generated what Prescott called the first significant crisis of Charles\u2019 reign, with fresh revelations about his ties to Epstein last month spurring the king to strip his royal titles and eject him from his home in Windsor.",
      "Earlier this month, 16 Democrats on the House Oversight Committee wrote to ask the former prince, now Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, to cooperate with their inquiry into Epstein. Thursday is the deadline for Andrew to respond.",
      "Now, with Kate seemingly back on the royal front line, there appears to be an opportunity to refocus, royal observers said.",
      "\u201cThis was Kate\u2019s first speech in two years, and she looked very polished, very calm and confident, and she is clearly in a really good place,\u201d said Emily Nash, royal editor at HELLO! Magazine. \u201cWe can expect to see a lot more of this going forward.\u201d",
      "Kate regularly polls as one of the most popular members of the royal family.",
      "Her favorability rating stood at 73% in October, according to a poll by YouGov, just below that of her husband, Prince William, at 76%. The royal family in general had a 59% favorability rating.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a feeling that she\u2019s never put a foot wrong,\u201d Prescott said. A sense of affection and support for William after his mother, Princess Diana, died in a car crash extended to Kate after she married into the royal family and \u201cgave her a good platform from which to build,\u201d he added.",
      "Like the late queen, she is someone who takes her role as a member of the royal family very seriously and understands the concept of duty, Prescott said."

      "The competition, which generates most of its revenue from licensing regional broadcasting rights, was sold to Anne Jakkaphong Jakrajutatip, a Thai businesswoman, for $20 million in 2022.",

      "Japan, which says it continues to prefer a peaceful solution to the Taiwan issue, has also advised its citizens to take extra safety precautions in China.",
      "\u201cThe government will continue to closely monitor the situation, including the impact of the series of measures by China, and take appropriate action,\u201d Minoru Kihara, the Japanese government\u2019s top spokesperson, told reporters Tuesday.",
      "Following the government\u2019s instructions, several major Chinese airlines have started offering free refunds or itinerary changes for eligible tickets for flights to and from Japan.",
      "The number of canceled flights was not immediately clear. Some travel businesses have reported disruption and losses amid the China-Japan tensions.",
      "East Japan International Travel Agency, a Tokyo-based tour operator offering tailored services to Chinese tourists, said tat about 70% of its group tours had been canceled, marking a \u201csignificant surge,\u201d and that new inquiries had also decreased about 90%.",
      "\u201cNormally, the period from late December to the Lunar New Year is peak season for corporate incentive travel,\u201d Yu Jixin, the agency\u2019s vice president, said in an emailed statement. \u201cBut this year, almost none of these groups are expected to visit Japan.\u201d",
      "Beijing Huatu International Travel Agency said it had suspended bookings for Japan-related tours until further orders from Chinese authorities.",

    "summary": "At least 10 people were killed in a Russian missile and drone attack that struck a residential tower block in the city of Ternopil, Ukrainian officials said.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump this week approved a 28-point plan for peace between Russia and Ukraine that top administration officials have quietly developed over the last several weeks in consultation with Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev and Ukrainian officials, a senior administration official told NBC News.",
      "Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner were involved in formulating the plan, the official said.",
      "\u201cThe plan focuses on giving both sides security guarantees to secure a lasting peace,\u201d the senior official told NBC News. \u201cIt includes things Ukraine wants and needs to have a durable peace.\u201d",
      "The official would not outline details of a plan that the official believes is still up for some degree of negotiation with the key parties involved. Axios first reported the existence of the plan.",
      "Three U.S. officials told NBC News that the framework for the peace deal still needed to be presented to the Ukrainians and that the timing of finalizing a draft of the plan coincided with the visit of an Army delegation to Ukraine.",
      "\"Ending a complex and deadly war such as the one in Ukraine requires an extensive exchange of serious and realistic ideas. And achieving a durable peace will require both sides to agree to difficult but necessary concessions,\" Rubio posted on X on Wednesday. \"That is why we are and will continue to develop a list of potential ideas for ending this war based on input from both sides of this conflict.\"",
      "The American delegation arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday morning with two missions for its meetings with Ukrainian officials: to discuss military strategy and technology and to help revive the peace process, according to two U.S. officials, a European official and a source close to the Ukrainian government.",
      "Army Secretary Dan Driscoll was joined by the Army chief of staff, Gen. Randy George, and other top Army officials, Col. Dave Butler, an Army spokesperson, said in a statement, hours after Ukrainian police said at least 25 people were killed in heavy overnight Russian missile and drone attacks.",
      "A U.S. official described the trip as a White House plan intended to \u201crestart peace negotiations.\u201d",
      "American efforts to revive peace negotiations appear to be gaining momentum, although the Kremlin has shown no sign of changing its terms for ending the war and it played down a media report that the United States was working on a 28-point peace plan.",
      "Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said at a news briefing that there were \u201cno such plans\u201d for Russia to meet Driscoll after his talks in Kyiv, indicating there had been little change since talks in Alaska in August.",
      "A defense official said that Driscoll has been briefed on the 28-point plan but that is not the main focus of his meetings in Kyiv.",
      "Ukraine did not take part in shaping the proposed peace plan, according to a source close to the Ukrainian government and a European official with knowledge of the matter. Ukraine was informed of the broad contours of the plan but was not briefed in detail and was not asked to provide input, the two sources said.",
      "Ukrainian officials view the timing of the proposal, coinciding with a damaging corruption scandal facing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s government, as no coincidence, the source close to the Ukrainian government said, and the officials see it as most likely an attempt by the Kremlin to take advantage of a potentially weakened Ukrainian leadership.",
      "A Trump ally, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who has led on legislation to punish Russia for its actions in Ukraine, told NBC News he was not previously aware of the plan.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d said Graham, who spoke to Trump on Tuesday evening. \u201cBut I will say this: I hope there\u2019s no plan out there \u2014 no plan will work unless [Russian President Vladimir] Putin believes that we\u2019re serious about continuing to provide higher end military aid to Ukraine.\u201d",
      "The U.S. delegation in Kyiv is discussing military matters, including air defense efforts against Russian drone and missile attacks on the country\u2019s energy infrastructure, and mapping the front line to help a possible peace process, said the source close to the Ukrainian government and a European official with knowledge of the matter.",
      "Previous diplomatic efforts led by Witkoff also excluded Ukraine and collapsed, as Kyiv and NATO allies viewed the proposals as lopsided in Moscow\u2019s favor with little realistic prospect of resolving the conflict.",
      "Russia has consistently demanded severe restrictions on Ukraine\u2019s armed forces, prohibiting the country from joining the NATO alliance and barring the presence of Western troops to secure any peace.",
      "\u201cThe president has been clear that it is time to stop the killing and make a deal to end the war. President Trump believes that there is a chance to end this senseless war if flexibility is shown,\u201d a White House official said.",
      "Driscoll and his delegation arrived in the Ukrainian capital after an overnight Russian missile and drone attack on several Ukrainian cities.",
      "After an apartment building was hit in the western city of Ternopil, the National Police of Ukraine said on Telegram that 25 people, including three children, were killed.",
      "Sixty-six more people were wounded in the strikes, which targeted energy and transportation infrastructure, forcing emergency power cuts in a number of regions, said officials, who added that Russia launched more than 470 drones and 48 missiles.",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry said Wednesday that it \u201ccarried out a massive strike with long-range, high-precision air- and sea-launched weapons\u201d in response \u201cto Ukraine\u2019s terrorist attacks on civilian facilities.\u201d It added that it had targeted \u201cmilitary-industrial facilities and energy infrastructure.\u201d",
      "The Kremlin has repeatedly said its only targets are linked to Kyiv\u2019s war effort, but it has been pummeling Ukraine with near-daily drone and missile strikes that have killed and wounded civilians.",
      "It has also targeted Ukraine\u2019s energy sector in a bid to plunge the country into the cold and dark ahead of winter.",
      "Energy infrastructure had been struck in seven Ukrainian regions, officials said Wednesday. Explosions were also reported in the western city of Lviv.",
      "The full extent of the damage was not immediately clear, but restrictions were placed on power usage for consumers across the country, according to Reuters.",
      "In Ternopil on Wednesday, the upper floors of the residential building were torn away in the attack. Black smoke poured upward, while an orange glow burned though the haze from a fire in the tower block.",
      "Zelenskyy confirmed that multistory residential buildings had been hit in the city, and said others may be trapped under the rubble.",
      "He also urged allies to increase pressure on Russia to end its nearly four-year war in Ukraine, including by providing Kyiv with more air defense missiles.",
      "\u201cEvery brazen attack against ordinary life shows that the pressure on Russia is insufficient. Effective sanctions and assistance to Ukraine can change this,\u201d he said on X.",
      "Elsewhere, Poland scrambled Polish and allied aircraft and temporarily closed airports in the southeastern cities of Rzesz\u00f3w and Lublin as a precaution to safeguard the airspace over the NATO member state, which borders western Ukraine."

      "If the library system in the Canadian city of Hamilton, Ontario, handed out fines for overdue books, the one for a recently returned tome titled \u201cThe Excellent Woman\u201d would be a whopper.",
      "The Victorian-era guidebook for ambitious Christian women by a British writer named Anne Pratt appears to have been checked out about 135 years ago from the Hamilton Public Library, a spokesperson for the library said.",
      "And the suspected scofflaw, a \"Miss Charlotte Morgan\" of Central School in Hamilton, incriminated herself by writing her name on a back page.",
      "\u201cWe know she was a teacher at the school in the 1890s, and we know she died in 1942,\u201d Robert Moore, a history teacher who found the book in his late father\u2019s house and returned it to the library last week, told NBC News. \u201cThe mystery now is when exactly in the 1890s she checked the book out and how it wound up behind the grate at the school where my father found it 50 years ago.\u201d",
      "As for the book, it appears to be one of the first volumes that appeared on the shelves when the library opened its doors in September 1890, Moore said. \u201cInside it is listed as book No. 54, written by hand in ink,\u201d he said.",
      "Shelley McKay, a spokesperson for the library, said, \u201cThis might be one of the original books from the original Hamilton library.\u201d",
      "McKay said this edition was published in 1852 in Boston, five years after it made its debut in England.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s in good shape,\u201d she said. \u201cI should look so good at its age.\u201d",
      "Moore said his father, Tom, was a \u201cstationary engineer\u201d at what was then called the Central Public School. He said his dad was doing some renovations on the heating system when he stumbled across the book and brought it home.",
      "\u201cI remember him showing it to us, and I remember reading it,\u201d Moore said. \u201cIt had all these beautiful illustrations and very flowery Victorian language. \u201c",
      "Moore said that it sat on a bookshelf until his father died this year and that he came across it when he was cleaning out the house.",
      "\u201cI said to myself, \u2018This has got to go back to the library,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "It was welcomed back with open arms, McKay said.",
      "\u201cHe brought it to our Sherwood branch, and we were more than a little surprised and taken aback by the discovery,\u201d she said.",
      "Asked whether she had had a chance to peruse the book, McKay said she had.",
      "\u201cI would say it\u2019s of its time,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s really a beautiful book. The illustrations are gorgeous.\u201d",
      "While Pratt wrote the book, her name does not appear on the title page on this edition. Instead, the name of the author of the introduction, a Protestant clergyman named William B. Sprague, is prominently displayed.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s because Sprague was well-known at the time,\u201d Moore said. \u201cHe had his sermons published. And there was still a stigma against books by women writers.\u201d",
      "Pratt\u2019s book is essentially a commentary on the Bible\u2019s Book of Proverbs, which discusses \u2014 and offers tips on \u2014 how women should behave.",
      "Moore said the book, for its time, was \u201cvery empowering for women,\u201d although it might not go over well with \u201chard-core feminists\" today.",
      "\u201cAnne Pratt was very critical of vapid women in England who just aimed to marry well and go to parties,\u201d Moore said. \u201cShe was encouraging women to do more with their lives, to be in a partnership with their husbands and not just submit to their husbands.\u201d",
      "McKay said that the recovery of Pratt\u2019s book has generated great excitement in Hamilton and that she has gotten numerous calls from people who want to see it.",
      "\u201cWe hope this will encourage people to look under their beds in their closets and return those old library materials,\u201d McKay said.",
      "But there are no plans to put Pratt's book back out into circulation.",
      "\u201cThis is heading to the archives,\u201d she said."

      "The mystery surrounding a plane that arrived in South Africa carrying more than 150 Palestinians deepened Wednesday after the company at the center of the saga responded to media coverage.",
      "Inconsistencies involving the public profile of Al-Majd Europe, a company that some on the flight said organized their travel, have only added to the uncertainty over how the passengers were able to leave the Middle East and who was ultimately behind their voyage.",
      "In a lengthy statement late Tuesday, Al-Majd did not directly acknowledge organizing the flight, which South Africa labeled \u201ca clearly orchestrated operation,\u201d after it landed in Johannesburg last week to the surprise of authorities.",
      "Al-Majd said that its \u201conly interaction with the Israeli authorities is for the purpose of coordinating exits from Gaza.\u201d",
      "South African Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola told reporters Monday that the flight was part of \u201ca clear agenda to cleanse the Palestinians out of Gaza and the West Bank.\u201d",
      "He did not say who was behind this alleged effort, but his comments were widely seen as being directed at Israel as the fragile ceasefire in Gaza intensifies questions about the fate of the 2 million Palestinians living in the devastated enclave.",
      "South Africa, a staunch Israel critic and supporter of the Palestinian cause, filed a case at the United Nations' International Court of Justice in late 2023 accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza, which Israel has vehemently rejected. The case remains ongoing.",
      "\u201cWe are suspicious as the South African government about the circumstances surrounding the arrival of the plane and the passengers that were in the plane,\u201d Lamola said, adding that his country was investigating further and did not want more such flights heading its way.",
      "COGAT, the Israeli military\u2019s liaison with the Palestinians, said the Palestinians left Gaza after it had received approval from a third country to receive them. COGAT did not name the third country.",
      "An Israeli government spokesperson said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u201chas made it clear\u201d that Gazans should be allowed to leave Gaza and come back as they please.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s peace plan stipulates that no one will be forced to leave Gaza, and those who wish to leave will be free to do so and free to return.",
      "But fears of ethnic cleansing have persisted among Palestinians and their supporters. Israel's government instructed its military in February to prepare a plan for Palestinians to voluntarily leave the enclave, after it embraced a Trump proposal for Gaza to be emptied of its residents and taken over by the United States.",
      "'Flushed out' of Gaza",
      "The chartered plane arrived at Johannesburg\u2019s O. R. Tambo International Airport on Thursday, appearing to blindside the South African government.",
      "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa told reporters Friday the Palestinians were from Gaza and were \u201cmysteriously\u201d put on a plane. They did not have the necessary documents to enter, he  said, but wouldn\u2019t be turned back because they come \u201cfrom a strife-torn, a war-torn country.\u201d",
      "He said South Africa would take them in \u201cout of compassion\u201d but added \u201cit does seem like they were being, you know, flushed out.\u201d",
      "South Africa\u2019s Border Management Authority said that the passengers on board the plane did not indicate duration of stay or accommodation in South Africa, and did not have exit stamps in their passports.",
      "They were initially denied entry, but 130 passengers had since been processed into the care of a South African nongovernmental organization called Gift of the Givers, which helps with relief efforts in war zones and disaster areas.",
      "The other 23 continued to other destinations, the Border Management Authority said. Palestinians are eligible for 90-day visa-exempt travel to South Africa, it added.",
      "NBC News has reached out to the South African government for further comment.",
      "It was not immediately clear how the Palestinians on board would have been able to leave Israel without proper documents.",
      "Questions over who's behind the flight",
      "Reuters spoke with two Palestinians who said they paid $2,000 per seat to fly their families to South Africa on the plane, as part of a trip arranged by an organization called Al-Majd Europe. They said they were bused from Gaza, and taken through the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing before being flown out of an Israeli airport last week.",
      "NBC News initially reached out to Al-Majd Europe on Tuesday via an email listed on its website but did not hear back. Its location is only listed as Sheikh Jarrah, Jerusalem, with an embedded map with a pin pointing to a building behind a hospital and the British Consulate.",
      "NBC News' analysis of its online presence revealed a number of inconsistencies.",
      "Al-Majd says it's a \u201chumanitarian organization, founded in 2010 in Germany\u201d but NBC News found no evidence that its website existed before February this year. Its Facebook and X accounts were also created this year. NBC News also could not find the organization in the register of the German tax administration.",
      "NBC News determined that a photo accompanying the \u201cabout\u201d page shows a building with the Al-Majd sign and Jerusalem's Dome of the Rock in the background was AI-generated. The website has multiple blog posts with case study-style summaries of its claimed work as a charity during the war in Syria and the earthquake in Turkey. While the website was created this year, the blog posts are dated from 2023.",
      "One of the case studies listed shows a photo of a woman it calls Mona Farouk, who it says left Syria for neighboring Lebanon in 2013, and then needed Al-Majd's help in 2014 to flee the fighting again. A reverse image search led NBC News to a Middle East Eye article last year with the same photo, which the news organization credits to its own journalist. The article names the woman in the photo as Abeer Khayat, and says she left Syria in 2012.",
      "The website has a terms and conditions page that states that \u201cthe organizing entity\u201d for the \u201cVoluntary Migration Program\u201d to leave the Gaza strip is Talent Globus.",
      "NBC News found that it is a company registered in Estonia in 2024 by a person named Tomer Janar Lind. NBC News has reached out to an account with the same name on LinkedIn. The United Kingdom's business registry shows Lind as a director in two dissolved companies and one active company with overdue accounts. None of them appear to be linked to Talent Globus.",
      "The Talent Globus website lists four employees, three of whom are shown with stock images that are available online. The company's \u201cabout\u201d section says it\u2019s been around for a decade, yet the company records say it was founded in 2024. The phone number listed doesn\u2019t work when called.",
      "The company released a statement on X late Tuesday in order to \"directly address the false accusations and disinformation circulated by parties with clear political interests\" that it said were meant \u201cto strip the people of Gaza of their freedom of choice.\u201d",
      "It said it had no connection to Israel\u2019s Mossad or any other intelligence services, and claimed that it \"was founded by refugees who escaped dictatorial regimes, including refugees from Hamas rule in Gaza.\"",
      "The statement did not directly mention the Palestinians who arrived in South Africa last week or the inconsistencies on its website.",
      "NBC News has reached out to Al-Majd for further clarification.",
      "The Palestinian Embassy in South Africa told NBC News that it was closely monitoring the situation and liaising with South African authorities to ensure the protection and well-being of all Palestinian nationals involved, but that \u201cdue to the sensitivity of the matter,\u201d the embassy was not able to provide further details at this time.",

      "In his first visit to the White House since the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Mohammed bin Salman received a warm welcome from President Donald Trump, who contradicted U.S. intelligence and said the Saudi crown prince \u201cknew nothing\u201d about the killing.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial,\u201d Trump said Tuesday in response to questions from a journalist about Khashoggi. \u201cA lot of people didn\u2019t like that gentleman that you\u2019re talking about. Whether you like him or didn\u2019t like him, things happen, but [the crown prince] knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that.\u201d",
      "Trump began his remarks by saying that he was proud of the crown prince in \u201cterms of human rights and everything else.\u201d",
      "Crown Prince Mohammed, 40, became an international pariah after the 2018 murder of Khashoggi, a fierce critic of his government. At the time, Trump defended the Saudi government even after the CIA concluded that the crown prince himself ordered the killing.",
      "Trump lashed out at a reporter from ABC News who asked the crown prince about Khashoggi's death and about criticism from the families of the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, many of whom have long pushed for answers on the Saudi government's potential ties to the attackers.",
      "\"ABC, fake news, one of the worst, one of the worst in the business,\" he said.",
      "The crown prince dismissed the criticisms against the Saudi government as part of a campaign to drive a wedge between Washington and Riyadh.",
      "\"I feel painful about, you know, families of 9/11 in America,\" he said. \"But you know, we have to focus on reality.\"",
      "Crown Prince Mohammed also defended the kingdom\u2019s probe into Khashoggi's murder, which he said included internal reforms. A Saudi court sentenced five people to death for their involvement in the killing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been painful for us in Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said, promising that \u201cwe are doing our best that this doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d",
      "Hanan Elatr Khashoggi, the journalist's widow, responded to Trump on X, writing, \"There is no justification to murder my husband. While Jamal was a good transparent and brave man many people may not have agreed with his opinions and desire for freedom of the press. The Crown Prince said he was sorry so he should meet me, apologize and compensate me for the murder of my husband.\"",
      "The crown prince said in 2019 that he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for the Khashoggi killing since it happened on his watch but denied having ordered it.",
      "Khashoggi's death has highlighted the risks journalists face around the world, particularly in areas where there is conflict. A report from the Committee to Protect Journalists released in February said that at least 124 journalists and media workers were killed in 2024, mainly Palestinian journalists killed as a result of Israel's military offensive in Gaza.",
      "The crown prince's trip Tuesday will be seen more broadly as a move toward acceptance back into the diplomatic fold.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a different kind of figure now. Obviously, the questions about the manner of his rule and internal repression, those things haven\u2019t gone away. But he\u2019s a changed figure; it\u2019s a changed moment. And, I think, important symbolically in that sense,\u201d said Michael Wahid Hanna, the U.S. program director at the International Crisis Group, a global nonprofit organization based in Brussels that works to prevent conflicts.",
      "He added: \u201cHe\u2019s central to what this administration wants to do in the region.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s welcome of the crown prince was an elaborate display of pomp and circumstance. After arriving at the White House, the crown prince was greeted by a military flyover of stealth fighter jets, officers on horseback and a tour of the Rose Garden from Trump. Later, speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, the president praised the reception that he received when he visited the kingdom this year. \u201cI love the country and people,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump and the crown prince joked about investing $1 trillion \u2014 a sum roughly equal to Saudi Arabia's entire wealth fund \u2014 into the United States, up from a $600 billion pledge.",
      "The two leaders are also expected to sign economic and defense agreements, a White House official told NBC News.",
      "Even before the crown prince had set foot in the United States, Trump confirmed at an Oval Office event Monday that he would be willing to sign off on the sale of F-35 stealth fighter jets to the kingdom, a contentious move that could shift the balance of power in the Middle East, where Israel has been the primary recipient of America\u2019s cutting-edge military technology. Trump repeated the pledge Tuesday and promised a deal.",
      "Trump\u2019s announcement of the sale may not actually lead to Saudi Arabia receiving the F-35s anytime soon, analysts say.",
      "\u201cThe devil will kind of be in the details there,\u201d said Andrew Leber, a nonresident fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who has done extensive research on Saudi Arabia, noting that a similar deal announced with the United Arab Emirates fell through.",
      "He added, \u201cThat deal ultimately ran aground on a combination of U.S. concerns with maintaining Israel\u2019s qualitative military edge and concerns about the extent to which U.S. security technology might leak to China.\u201d",
      "Trump designated Saudi Arabia a \u201cMajor Non-NATO Ally\" on Tuesday, noting that the classification would take the country\u2019s military cooperation with the United States \u201cto even greater heights.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou always had a little cloud over your head, and sometimes that cloud was very big. That cloud is not there anymore, and we want to keep it that way,\u201d Trump said before he announced the designation at a dinner honoring Crown Prince Mohammed.",
      "Major Non-NATO Ally status is a designation that \u201cprovides foreign partners with certain benefits in the areas of defense trade and security cooperation,\u201d according to the State Department. It does not, however, require U.S. security commitments to such countries.",
      "The possibility of Saudi Arabia normalizing relations with Israel is a key part of the talks. \u201cI already brought it up,\" Trump said when asked about the prospect of Saudi Arabia joining the Abraham Accords, the 2020 U.S.-brokered agreement that led a number of regional countries to establish formal diplomatic ties with Israel. \"I don\u2019t want to use the word 'commitment,' but we had a good talk,\" he said.",
      "Analysts have been skeptical about a breakthrough.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no near-term horizon for normalization at the moment,\u201d Hanna said.",
      "\"The risks for Mohammed bin Salman are extremely high if he joins the Abraham Accords,\" agreed Fawaz Gerges, professor of international relations at the London School of Economics. He noted that Saudi Arabia had made clear it would need some form of Israeli commitment to a path to a Palestinian state \u2014 something Israel has publicly dismissed.",
      "The crown prince's strategy was generally \"to minimize the risks to his rule,\" Gerges said.",
      "Even if the crown prince does not announce the establishment of diplomatic ties with Israel, he has won favor with Trump as one of the regional leaders who helped pull together the current ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.",
      "Trump has long touted his deal-making abilities and, according to a senior administration official, a number of deals are expected to be announced Tuesday, including a multibillion-dollar Saudi investment in America\u2019s artificial intelligence infrastructure, enhanced cooperation on civil nuclear energy and fulfillment of the Saudis' $600 billion investment pledge via dozens of targeted investments.",
      "Critics have raised questions about Trump\u2019s affinity for mixing personal business and diplomacy. His properties have for years hosted tournaments for the Saudi-backed LIV Golf. And The New York Times reported this weekend that the Trump Organization is looking at a huge real estate deal with Saudi Arabia.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s some massive ethical questions in here,\u201d Leber of the Carnegie Endowment said. \u201cIt\u2019s very obvious that all of the Gulf states have realized that the way you get to Trump is to find some way to enrich his family members, enrich his friends, promise to enrich them down the line.\u201d",
      "Trump, asked about his family\u2019s business ties to Saudi Arabia, said they \u201cdo business all over,\u201d and that he's no longer involved in the activities.",
      "Governments dealing with Saudi Arabia, human rights groups have long said, should also push the country\u2019s leaders on its dismal human rights record. In August, a report from Human Rights Watch noted an \u201cunprecedented surge\u201d in executions in 2025, with 241 people put to death as of Aug. 5.",
      "Still, the restrictions on women, another regular criticism leveled at the kingdom, have been eased, and the crown prince has tried to open up the society to Western exports, like Ultimate Fighting Championship matches and comedy shows, though the comedians who recently appeared at a comedy festival in Riyadh, including Louis C.K. and Bill Burr, were blasted for performing there.",
      "\u201cThis hasn\u2019t been political reform in the sense of creating space for real politics, but he\u2019s absolutely, fundamentally reoriented Saudi society and changed the role of the religious authorities,\u201d Hanna of the ICG said. \u201cThere\u2019s incredible social change that has happened partly because he\u2019s operating without any real constraints.\""

    "summary": "President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan may have passed the U.N. Security Council. But there are still major questions of how it will work.",
    "story": [
      "To hear President Donald Trump tell it, this was \"one of the biggest approvals in the history of the United Nations,\" a \"moment of true historic proportion\" that would \" lead to further peace all over the world.\" But the gravity of the U.N. Security Council's endorsement of the U.S. Gaza plan raised renewed questions Tuesday over how it will actually work.",
      "Most pressingly, it is not clear whether those at the heart of the conflict \u2014 the Palestinians and the Israelis themselves \u2014 actually support its end goals.",
      "Hamas, which still controls around half of the strip, outright rejected the resolution and said it robs Palestinians of their own agency, effectively giving Trump free rein over the Gaza Strip for the next two years. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed its passage, but he previously said he rejects its talk of \"Palestinian self-determination and statehood.\"",
      "On a practical level, the proposal says it will require the creation of several as-yet-nonexistent bodies, including the \u201cBoard of Peace\u201d headed by Trump and the International Stabilization Force, or ISF, whose troops could be drawn from Turkey and the United Arab Emirates and as far away as Indonesia.",
      "That having been said, this was a rare moment of geopolitical unity.",
      "Trump's team won the support of Arab states by inserting language hinting at a future Palestinian state, and Russia and China abstained from the vote rather than use their vetoes to torpedo the proposal outright.",
      "It passed 13-0.",
      "Summarizing the mood Tuesday, U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres welcomed the vote as \"an important step\" but cautioned that it was \"essential now to translate the diplomatic momentum into concrete and urgently needed steps on the ground,\" his office said in a statement.",
      "It's a sentiment shared by many observers.",
      "Frank Lowenstein, former special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations under President Barack Obama, told NBC News that passing the resolution was \"essential\" for Trump's proposal.",
      "\"There was no way this Trump plan could possibly work without a U.N. Security Council resolution,\" he said. Not only will it impart \"the credibility and the legitimacy and the clear support of the international community,\" but it also \"provides an opportunity to begin creating a new reality, to begin moving forward with the process in a way that will give people hope.\"",
      "He cautioned, however, that the resolution's passage was \"nowhere near sufficient,\" principally because the U.N. has no enforcement mechanism, and that Hamas immediately rejected the ISF.",
      "The resolution claims \"the parties\" to the conflict \"have accepted it.\" But it's not clear that is the case.",
      "The main Palestinian governmental body, the Palestinian Authority, said in a statement Tuesday that it welcomed the resolution and expressed its \"full readiness to cooperate\" with the United States and its backers.",
      "But Hamas, the perpetrators of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack, said the agreement did not meet the \"political and humanitarian demands and rights\" of the Palestinian people.",
      "The Palestinian militant-political group, which is designated a terrorist organization by the United States and would be disarmed under the deal, said in a statement that the mandate the resolution grants to the ISF to use force \u201cstrips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favor of the occupation.\u201d",
      "NBC News has contacted the White House for a response to those criticisms.",
      "Netanyahu praised Trump and \"his tireless and devoted team,\" saying he believed the plan \"will lead to peace and prosperity because it insists upon full demilitarization, disarmament and the deradicalization of Gaza.\"",
      "But just a day earlier, he had firmly rejected the resolution\u2019s call for \u201ca pathway towards Palestinian self-determination and eventual statehood,\u201d under pressure from his far-right coalition partners.",
      "Even putting those differences to one side, there are big question marks about how the basics of this plan will work in practice.",
      "\u201cThere is a genuine sense of relief that we are moving forward to diplomacy,\u201d said Nimrod Goren, the president of the Mitvim Institute, a progressive Israeli think tank.",
      "\u201cOn the other hand, it\u2019s not really clear where all this is headed,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat is the commitment of the leaders, the motivations of those behind it? And can it actually lead us away from the status quo in which Hamas still controls part of Gaza and Israel controls other parts around it?\u201d",
      "On his Truth Social platform, Trump said members of the Board of Peace would be named in the coming weeks \u2014 having previously said British Prime Minister Tony Blair would be involved \u2014 and to expect \"many more exciting announcements.\"",
      "Goren said: \"There are all kinds of new terminology and mechanisms that do not yet exist. So there are a lot of question marks on the basic premises: What is their mandate? How will they be set up?\"",
      "Indonesia, one of the backers of the U.S. proposal, says it is readying 20,000 troops to deploy to the ISF. But they are unlikely to head into Gaza so long as Hamas opposes the deal, Lowenstein said.",
      "\"Nobody's going to send troops to be a part of the stabilization force that's going to be fighting Hamas,\" he said."

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s Gaza peace plan was passed by a majority vote at the United Nations on Monday, though world powers were still divided over whether it can convert a fragile ceasefire into the long-term solution that has eluded the Middle East.",
      "Much about the plan remains uncertain, with occasional outbreaks of violence between Israel and Hamas threatening the tenuous diplomacy at every turn and Palestinians inside Gaza suffering hunger and now flooding at the onset of a bitter winter.",
      "The fraught path was made clear even before the delegates took to their desks, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2014 under pressure from his far-right coalition partners \u2014 denouncing the resolution's outlining of a future Palestinian state. Hamas also warned against the U.S. proposal.",
      "The Security Council adopted the plan with 13 votes in favor, zero votes against and two abstentions, Russia and China.",
      "\"Today\u2019s resolution represents another significant step towards a stable Gaza that will be able to prosper, and an environment that will allow Israel to live in security,\" Mike Waltz, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said after the vote.",
      "Designed to usher Gaza from rubble-strewn war zone into a new era, the resolution backs establishing a \u201cBoard of Peace,\u201d headed by the president himself, to temporarily govern the territory. Alongside that, an International Stabilization Force, known as the ISF, would take over responsibility from the Israel Defense Forces currently occupying parts of the Gaza Strip.",
      "The proposal would be \u201cphase two\u201d of Trump\u2019s 20-point plan first announced in September, \u201cphase one\u201d of which brought a prisoner and hostage exchange, as well as a ceasefire that has largely held despite accusations of violations from both sides.",
      "Israel\u2019s military offensive has killed at least 69,000 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, according to local health officials. Israel launched it after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist, attack in which 1,200 people were killed and 250 more were kidnapped.",
      "Some Security Council members objected that the U.S. resolution made no reference of Palestinian statehood, according to The Associated Press. The draft now says that after the Palestinian Authority has \u201cfaithfully carried out and Gaza redevelopment has advanced, the conditions may be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood,\u201d the AP reported.",
      "The resolution supporting the U.S. plan is backed by Qatar, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and other Arab states, as well as Turkey, Indonesia and Pakistan. Of those, the only ones on the Security Council are the United States and Pakistan, a nonpermanent member, which therefore does not have a veto.",
      "A joint statement from the United States and its backers said the \u201cprocess offers a pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood\u201d and \u201cprovides a viable path towards peace and stability, not only between the Israelis and the Palestinians, but for the entire region.\u201d",
      "The U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, lauded Trump for having \u201cassembled the Arab leaders and got them all to sign on the historic agreement.\u201d On Palestinian statehood, he issued a caveat that \u201cthe resolution does not call for the state, but it does say that it lays the groundwork, providing that there are reforms that have been called for for a long time.\u201d",
      "Even so, the open door to Palestinian statehood within the resolution has angered the Israeli far right, whose leading politicians are propping up Netanyahu\u2019s government. Under pressure from them, Netanyahu came out Sunday saying that \u201cour opposition to a Palestinian state in any territory has not changed.\u201d",
      "He said at a meeting: \u201cGaza will be demobilized and Hamas will be disarmed, the easy way or the hard way. I don\u2019t need reinforcements and tweets and lectures from anyone.\u201d",
      "The Hamas-led Palestinian Resistance Factions called the plan an \"attempt to impose another form of occupation on our land and people\" and \"a violation of our national sovereignty and a continuation of our people's suffering.\"",

      "The production studio behind Tilly Norwood, a digital character dubbed Hollywood's first \"AI actor,\" plans to join forces with the History Channel in the Netherlands on an AI-powered time travel series, the companies announced Monday.",
      "The 10-part series, \"Streets of the Past,\" will feature Dutch author and media personality Corjan Mol exploring famed streets and squares across the Netherlands \"with the help of AI.\"",
      "\"AI will help Mol step back in time and join the action in a cameo role,\" the companies said in a news release. \"Each immersive historical scene will be created by AI using archival materials \u2014 such as paintings, engravings or photos \u2014 to ensure accuracy.\"",
      "The series will be produced by Particle6, a company based in the United Kingdom. Particle6 is best known for developing Tilly Norwood, a synthetic character that has stoked intense controversy in the traditional entertainment industry.",
      "In a statement in September that earned national news coverage, for example, the Screen Actors Guild condemned reports that Hollywood talent agencies were exploring whether to sign Tilly Norwood as a client.",
      "\"To be clear, 'Tilly Norwood' is not an actor, it's a character generated by a computer program that was trained on the work of countless professional performers \u2014 without permission or compensation\" the guild said.",
      "\"It has no life experience to draw from, no emotion and, from what we've seen, audiences aren't interested in watching computer-generated content untethered from the human experience,\" the guild added.",
      "Dutch comedian and writer Eline Van der Velden, who founded Particle6, pushed back on the criticism at the time. In a statement on Instagram, Van der Velden said she views \"AI not as a replacement for people, but as a tool \u2014 a new paintbrush.\"",
      "\"AI characters should be judged as part of their own genre, on their own merits, rather than compared directly with human actors,\" she wrote. \"Each form of art has its place, and each can be valued for what it uniquely brings.\"",
      "Sam Pearson, the head of short form commissioning at Hearst Networks, said Monday that the History Channel would be \"transparent\" about how AI is used in the time travel series.",
      "\"We will continue to explore [AI's] potential with ethical partners such as Particle6, using it thoughtfully, with clear guardrails and principles, while all the time being transparent with our audiences and sharing when they are watching AI-generated content,\" Pearson said."
