    "story": [
      "The story of RaMell Ross\u2019 \u201cNickel Boys,\u201d laced with the cruelties of the Jim Crow-era South, has commonalities with films made before",
      "NEW YORK -- RaMell Ross sometimes sends his photography students out on a unique assignment. He tells them to photograph a white person, a Black person, an Asian person and an Indian person. \u201cAnd,\u201d he adds, \u201cI want you to ask them how they want to be represented.\u201d",
      "Before Ross was a photographer, a professor, a documentarian and, most recently, a feature filmmaker, he was a point guard whose 6-foot-6-inches height allowed him to peer over defenders to see the entire court. Ross\u2019 basketball career was derailed by injuries while at Georgetown University. But he has, ever since been fascinated with the ways we see.",
      "In \u201cNickel Boys,\u201d one of the most thrillingly innovative American films of the decade, Ross adapts Colson Whitehead\u2019s 2019 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. It\u2019s about two young men \u2014 Elwood (Ethan Herisse) and Turner (Brandon Wilson) \u2014 who\u2019ve been sent to an abusive, mid-century Florida reform school called Nickel Academy.",
      "The story, laced with the cruelties of the Jim Crow-era South, has commonalities with films made before. But the grammar of \u201cNickel Boys\u201d is entirely its own. Ross shot the film, which opens Friday in New York and expands in coming weeks, almost entirely from the point of view of Elwood and Turner. As we watch, we\u2019re looking through their eyes. We gaze up at the sky or feel a blow to the head or feel the warmth of someone affectionately looking back at us.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an ode to looking out of the eyes of those whose eyes have been owned by others, and whose perception has been managed by others,\u201d Ross says. \u201cFilms that take place in the past reproduce the aesthetics of the past. I question the aesthetics of the past.\"",
      "In a medium that has been called \u201can empathy machine,\u201d \u201cNickel Boys\u201d is a striking leap forward. In situating the viewer within the inner world of Elwood and Turner, it brings us closer to their experience, while shedding many of the conventions of both modern moviemaking and historical depictions from the time period of \u201cNickel Boys.\u201d",
      "\u201cI know if any person in here that has wild stereotypes about the world that they acknowledge or don\u2019t if they saw through my eyes, they would be other gone, challenged or would collapse,\u201d said Ross in a recent interview over coffee in midtown Manhattan. \u201cThe power is in the self and the eyes.\u201d",
      "For Ross, who teaches visual art at Brown University, \u201cNickel Boys\u201d isn\u2019t just about finding a new way to photograph. It\u2019s an attempt to uncover a visual language of consciousness, and specifically Black consciousness. In the time of \u201cNickel Boys\u201d the dominant imagery was created overwhelmingly through a perspective that wasn\u2019t Elwood\u2019s, that wasn\u2019t Turner\u2019s.",
      "\u201cThe question is,\u201d says Ross, \u201ccan you repopulate the missing archive?\u201d",
      "POV camerawork has been tried occasionally through movie history. Robert Montgomery\u2019s 1947 Raymond Chandler adaptation \u201cThe Lady in the Lake\u201d is generally credited as the first mainstream film shot in first person. That same year, \u201cDark Passage\u201d began with a first-person prison escape, and doesn\u2019t change perspective until the escapee (Humphry Bogart) undergoes plastic surgery.",
      "But Ross wasn\u2019t thinking about any precedents. Ross, who wrote the script with Joslyn Barnes complete with head turns and camera moves, wanted something much deeper than a gimmick.",
      "In his most celebrated photography series, \u201cSouth County, AL (a Hale County),\u201d Ross examined Blackness across a Southern terrain indelibly traversed by photographers like Walker Evans. (Ross had moved to Greensboro, Alabama, to do social work and teach a college readiness program.) His images tend to be in dialogue with the photography of the past. Time, Ross says, became his medium.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m definitely interested in thickening the present,\u201d he says.",
      "For a month before shooting, Ross and cinematographer Jomo Fray rehearsed with a small digital camera. Fray, who shot Raven Jackson\u2019s lyrical 2023 mosaic drama \u201cAll Dirt Roads Taste of Salt,\u201d found the process of finding new filmic vernacular enthralling.",
      "\u201cWe have only begun to scratch the very surface of what cinema is capable of. Cinema is a medium that shares a language with our dreams,\u201d says Fray. \u201cWe\u2019re still at the infancy of this as an artistic form.\u201d",
      "Ross and Fray, each of whom can be dazzlingly analytical about filmmaking and photography, found they weren\u2019t exactly seeking POV. In reality, that would be too shaky and uncentered. Instead, they honed what they call \u201csentient perspective\u201d \u2014 a POV that didn't mimic eyes but came closer to the feeling of being within a body.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an invitation,\u201d says Fray. \u201cThe image is an invitation for the viewer to really place themselves in a body that they may or may not recognize. For two hours, you truly are walking in the shoes of another person. And that\u2019s at the heart of the promise of cinema.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t easy. Countless basic actions would need to be rethought. What would a hug look like? Production design, by Norah Mendis, essentially needed to be in all directions, 360 degrees. Operating the camera, Fray almost had to be an actor in the film, himself.",
      "\u201cThe second that we started getting into how to make the film, I understood immediately why films like this aren\u2019t made,\u201d says Ross.",
      "Yet, part of the beauty of \u201cNickel Boys\u201d is how impressionistic the imagery still is. We get to know Elwood and Turner not just by what they do or what they say, but how they look upon the world, what they notice. Herisse and Wilson had the unique experience of always acting either alongside the camera rig or staring back into a lens.",
      "\u201cA lot of time we\u2019d be trading places with Jomo or RaMell, but we\u2019d stay really close and try to stay as present as possible,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cOn the other side, when you have to look down a lens, that\u2019s a different thing. You\u2019re trying to not look like you\u2019re looking at a camera, but seeing the other person on the other side of the camera.\"",
      "\u201cThe first time I watched it, there was a complete detachment,\u201d says Herisse. \u201cI didn\u2019t make the connection that that was me.\u201d",
      "The experience of watching \u201cNickel Boys\u201d has been transcendent for many, though some critics have been more tepid about how the subjective POV alters your relationship to the characters. Some have said that connection is harder without the benefit of regular close-ups.",
      "While Ross grants that \u201cNickel Boys\u201d \u2014 a Golden Globe nominee for best feature film, drama, and a winner with several major awards groups \u2014 might be challenging for those who don\u2019t regularly engage with art or go to the theater, it\u2019s not a criticism he has much patience for.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t give a (expletive) that you want these Black boys\u2019 narratives to be told in a way you think makes you feel good, or make you feel connected emotionally. Can you hear yourself? Do you know how self-centered you sound?\u201d says Ross, addressing those critics. \u201cDo you know a way to treat the viewer not as a voyeur in the death of Black folks? I don\u2019t know, but I think there\u2019s an interesting way to try that doesn\u2019t repeat the brutality in the minds of others. It gives them life. It restores something. It\u2019s not about their death.\u201d",
      "Ross imagines he\u2019ll be making more movies, but, he says, he\u2019s in no rush. As a professor he gets to watch movies, look at photography, and talk to smart young people who have been trained in words but not in images.",
      "And Ross is still working out his own vernacular. \u201cShooting\u201d film, for example, doesn\u2019t sound right to him. What\u2019s better?",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know yet,\u201d Ross says. \u201cEngage the world. Go participate. Go make images.\u201d"

      "NEW YORK -- President-elect Donald Trump rang the opening bell Thursday at the New York Stock Exchange after being recognized for the second time by Time magazine as its person of the year.",
      "The honors for the businessman-turned-politician are a measure of Trump's remarkable comeback from an ostracized former president who refused to accept his election loss four years ago to a president-elect who won the White House decisively in November.",
      "Before he rang the opening bell at 9:30 a.m., a first for him, Trump spoke at the exchange and called it \u201ca tremendous honor.\u201d",
      "\u201cTime magazine, getting this honor for the second time, I think I like it better this time actually,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump, accompanied by his wife, Melania Trump, daughters Ivanka and Tiffany and Vice President-elect JD Vance, grinned as people chanted \u201cUSA\u201d before he opened the trading day. He then raised his fist.",
      "In his remarks, he talked up some of the people he has named to his incoming administration, including Treasury pick Scott Bessent, and some of his announced policies, including a promise this week that the federal government will issue expedited permits, including environmental approvals, for projects and construction worth more than $1 billion.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re going to have a tremendous run. We have to straighten out some problems, some big problems in the world,\u201d he said.",
      "Sam Jacobs, Time's editor in chief, announced on NBC's \u201cToday\u201d show that Trump was Time\u2019s 2024 Person of the Year. Jacobs said Trump was someone who \u201cfor better or for worse, had the most influence on the news in 2024.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is someone who made an historic comeback, who reshaped the American presidency and who\u2019s reordering American politics,\" Jacobs said. \"It\u2019s hard to argue with the fact that the person who\u2019s moving into the Oval Office is the most influential person in news.\"",
      "In an interview with the magazine published Thursday, Trump spoke about his final campaign blitz and election win.",
      "\u201cI called it \u201872 Days of Fury,\u2019\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe hit the nerve of the country. The country was angry.\u201d",
      "Trump was on Wall Street to mark the ceremonial start of the day\u2019s trading. The Time magazine cover featuring him was projected onto a wall at the stock exchange, flanked by American flags.",
      "Trump took the stage at the exchange flanked by family members and members of his incoming administration while his favored walk-on song, \u201cGod Bless the U.S.A.,\u201d played.",
      "Trump was also Time's Person of the Year in 2016, when he was first elected to the White House. He was listed as a finalist for this year\u2019s award alongside notables including Vice President Kamala Harris, X owner Elon Musk, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Kate, the Princess of Wales.",
      "Jacobs, in making the announcement Thursday, said that \u201cthere\u2019s always a hot debate\u201d at the magazine over the honor, \u201calthough I have to admit that this year was an easier decision than years past.\u201d",
      "The NYSE regularly invites celebrities and business leaders to participate in the 9:30 a.m. ceremonial opening trading. Thursday will be Trump's first time doing the honors, which have become a marker of culture and politics.",
      "Trump has long had a fascination with being on the cover of Time, where he first made an appearance in 1989. He has falsely claimed to hold the record for cover appearances, and The Washington Post reported in 2017 that Trump had a fake picture of himself on the cover of the magazine hanging in several of his golf country clubs.",
      "Earlier this year, Trump sat for interviews with the magazine for a story that ran in April. Time\u2019s billionaire owner, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, criticized Harris for not granting the magazine an interview during her campaign with Trump.",
      "In his latest interview published Thursday, Trump reiterated that he\u2019s going to pardon most of those convicted in riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. \u201cIt\u2019s going to start in the first hour,\u201d he said of the pardons. \u201cMaybe the first nine minutes.\u201d",
      "Trump said he would not ask members of his administration to sign a loyalty pledge. \u201cI think I will be able to, for the most part, determine who\u2019s loyal,\u201d he said. But he said he will fire anyone who doesn\u2019t follow his policies.",
      "On the war in Gaza, Trump said he wants to end the conflict and that Netanyahu knows it. When Trump was asked whether he trusted Netanyahu, he told Time: \u201cI don\u2019t trust anybody.\u201d",
      "The incoming president also discussed his plans for mass deportations and argued he will have the authority to use the military to assist with the effort, even though, as the magazine notes, the Posse Comitatus Act forbids the deployment of the military against civilians.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t stop the military if it\u2019s an invasion of our country,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll only do what the law allows, but I will go up to the maximum level of what the law allows.\u201d",
      "Trump crafted his image as a wealthy real estate developer, which he played up as the star of the TV reality show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d and during his presidential campaign. He won the election in part by channeling Americans' anxieties about the economy\u2019s ability to provide for the middle class.",
      "In an interview on CNBC after he rang the bell, Trump likened the broad cuts to the federal workforce that he and his advisers have telegraphed to the TV firings he made of contestants.",
      "\u201cWe're going to be doing the same thing, I can tell you. Unfortunately, there's too many of them,\" Trump said.",

      "MALIBU, Calif. -- Cooler temperatures, calmer winds and a chance of rainfall in Southern California this week are forecast to help firefighters as they battle a wind-driven blaze in steep, rugged terrain that's driven thousands, including celebrities, from their homes in Malibu.",
      "The weather improved so much Wednesday that meteorologists said all red flag warnings, which indicate conditions for high fire danger and the notorious Santa Ana winds, were discontinued. The conditions allowed firefighters to have \u201ca lot of success\u201d despite the nearly inaccessible terrain, CalFire Assistant Chief Dusty Martin said.",
      "Still, some 20,000 residents remained under evacuation orders and warnings Wednesday evening from the blaze, dubbed the Franklin Fire, which was only 7% contained over 6 square miles (16 square kilometers).",
      "It\u2019s unclear how the blaze started. Officials said nine structures had been destroyed and at least six others had been damaged, though crews had only surveyed about 25% of the affected area, said Deputy Chief Albert Yanagisawa of the Los Angeles County Fire Department.",
      "Much of the devastation occurred in Malibu, a community of about 10,000 people on the western edge of Los Angeles known for its stunning bluffs and Zuma Beach, which features in many Hollywood films.",
      "Flames burned near horse farms, celebrities\u2019 seaside mansions, and Pepperdine University, where students were forced to shelter in place on campus for a second night Tuesday.",
      "Faculty members are determining how best to complete the semester, which ends at Pepperdine this week. Final exams were postponed or canceled, depending on the class, university spokesperson Michael Friel said. An early analysis showed little to no damage to structures on campus, the university said.",
      "Lonnie Vidaurri\u2019s four-bedroom home in the Malibu Knolls neighborhood is one of those destroyed. After evacuating to a hotel in Santa Monica with his wife and two young daughters, a neighbor called to tell Vidaurri that firefighters would need to break into his house.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty torched all around,\u201d Vidaurri said. He expects that the family\u2019s pet bunnies did not survive the fire, and that they lost most of their things. \u201cMy girls cried, obviously, but it could have been worse.\u201d",
      "Mimi Teller, a Red Cross spokesperson who worked in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, said many people arrived in their pajamas and were \u201cdefinitely in shock.\u201d",
      "\u201cNobody even had a backpack, it was, \u2018Get out now,\u2019\u201d Teller said. \u201cOne lady didn\u2019t even have a leash for her dog, she just scooped them up.\u201d",
      "Shawn Smith said he was asleep early Tuesday when someone knocked on his RV at 3 a.m. to wake him up to evacuate the Malibu RV Park.",
      "\u201cYou could see the fires rolling in, in over the canyon,\" he said. \u201cIt was like \u2018Holy crap, this is real.'\u201d",
      "He returned Wednesday to find that the RV park had been saved \u2014 firefighters stopped the flames just before they entered the area.",
      "\u201cWe got lucky,\u201d he said.",
      "Cher, one of many celebrities with homes in Malibu, evacuated from her Malibu home when ordered and is staying at a hotel, her publicist, Liz Rosenberg, said Tuesday.",
      "And Dick Van Dyke said in a Facebook post that he and his wife, Arlene Silver, fled as the fire swept in. The actor later told NBC's \u201cToday\u201d that neighbors helped him get out.",
      "\u201cI was trying to crawl to the car. I had exhausted myself. I couldn\u2019t get up,\u201d said Van Dyke, who turns 99 Friday. \u201cAnd three neighbors came and carried me out, and came back and put out a little fire in the guesthouse and saved me.\u201d",
      "The fire erupted shortly before 11 p.m. Monday and swiftly moved south, jumping over the famous Pacific Coast Highway and extending all the way to the ocean. It was propelled by Santa Ana winds, with gusts that reached 40 mph (64 kph). Santa Anas are notorious seasonal winds that blow dry air from the interior toward the coast, pushing back moist ocean breezes.",
      "Alec Gellis stayed behind Monday night to save his home in Malibu\u2019s Serra Retreat neighborhood from the flames. He used pumps in the home\u2019s swimming pool to help spray water over the house and surrounding vegetation, turning the lush area \u201cinto a rainforest.\u201d",
      "Gellis said there were flames within 5 feet (1.5 meters) of the home on all sides. \u201cThe whole canyon was completely lit up.\u201d",
      "Utilities preemptively shut off power to tens of thousands of homes and businesses, starting Monday night, to mitigate the impacts of the Santa Ana winds, whose strong gusts can damage electrical equipment and spark wildfires.",
      "As of Wednesday afternoon, electricity was still out for roughly 600 Southern California Edison customers, and the majority of those were in Los Angeles County, said utility spokesperson Gabriela Ornelas.",
      "\u201cWe have been making significant progress,\u201d she said.",
      "Outages in Malibu were not included in that figure, Ornelas said. Some 3,300 customers in the Malibu area remained without power, due to safety shutoffs and for firefighter safety. Power was first shut off to most customers in Malibu on Monday evening.",
      "The Woolsey Fire that roared through the area in 2018, killing three people and destroying 1,600 homes, was sparked by Edison equipment. Asked Wednesday if Edison equipment was involved in the Franklin Fire, Ornelas referred all questions regarding the cause to fire officials.",

      "Woody Allen\u2019s former personal chef has filed a lawsuit against the filmmaker and his wife Soon-Yi Previn",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Woody Allen 's former personal chef claims in a lawsuit that the filmmaker and his wife fired him because of his service in the U.S. Army Reserves and questions about his pay, then \u201crubbed salt on the wounds\u201d by saying they didn't like his cooking.",
      "Allen and Soon-Yi Previn \u201csimply decided that a military professional who wanted to be paid fairly was not a good fit to work in the Allen home,\u201d private chef Hermie Fajardo said in a civil complaint filed Tuesday in federal court in Manhattan.",
      "Allen and Previn knew Fajardo would need time off for military training exercises when they and their home manager hired him as their full-time chef in June 2024 at an annual salary of $85,000, the complaint said. But he was fired the following month, soon after returning from a training that lasted a day longer than expected, it said.",
      "When Fajardo returned to work, \u201che was immediately met with instant hostility and obvious resentment by defendants,\u201d according to the lengthy complaint.",
      "At the time, Fajardo had been raising concerns about his pay \u2014 first that his employers weren't properly withholding taxes or providing a paystub, then that they shortchanged him by $300, according to the complaint.",
      "Allen, Previn and manager Pamela Steigmeyer are accused in the lawsuit of violating the federal Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act and New York labor law, as well as causing Fajardo humiliation, stress and a loss of earnings.",
      "Representatives for Allen did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.",
      "Fajardo said he was hired after being showered with compliments following a meal of roasted chicken, pasta, chocolate cake and apple pie he prepared for the defendants and two guests. According to the complaint, it was only after Previn fired him and he hired a lawyer that he was told his cooking was not up to par, a claim Fajardo said was untrue."

      "The rapper, whose given name is Tyquian Terrel Bowman, was sentenced to two years and nine months imprisonment by U.S. District Court judge in his hometown of Savannah, local news outlets reported.",
      "Bowman, 25, pleaded guilty in August to a single count of conspiracy to possess and distribute marijuana.

      "The new film \u201cSeptember 5\" is a fictionalized account of ABC\u2019s live coverage of the hostage crisis during the 1972 Munich Olympics",
      "News junkies will find much to love in \u201cSeptember 5,\u201d a fictionalized account of ABC\u2019s live coverage of the hostage crisis during the 1972 Munich Olympics. There are spirited debates about reporting with only one source, use of words like \u201cterrorism\u201d and what to do if violence breaks out during a live shot. There are negotiations with rival networks over satellite usage, disguises and fake badges made to get reels of 16mm film in and out of the locked down Olympic village and plenty of confused men (and a few women) trying to keep up with an ever-escalating situation.",
      "The film is a moment by moment retelling of how a group of sports broadcasters brought this story to the world in real time, despite the technical limitations and their own inexperience across a confusing 22 hours. Everyone came to the studio that night ready for breaking sports news, scores and pre-packaged interviews. Even that was going to be a test for the man running the control room for the first time. Geoffrey Mason, portrayed by John Magaro, was a 28-year-old coordinating producer. Someone wonders about his experience and is assured that he\u2019s covered minor league baseball games.",
      "But in the early hours of Sept. 5, 1972, eight members of a Palestinian group called Black September broke into the Olympic village and attacked the Israeli delegation killing wrestling coach Moshe Weinberg and weightlifter Yossi Romano. Some escaped, but nine others were taken hostage.",
      "While the tragedy of the Munich Olympics has certainly been told many times, writer and director Tim Fehlbaum saw an opportunity in the team behind the live broadcast. And he commits fully to staying in the newsroom, with all of its glorious old technologies, from the walkie-talkies they used to stay in touch and to taking time to show how they had to manually add text to the screens. He and his screenwriter were able to reconstruct the events almost minute-by-minute, which helped shape the screenplay.",
      "The players are many in this large ensemble. Peter Sarsgaard, who\u2019s looked right in a newsroom since \u201cShattered Glass,\u201d gives gravitas to Roone Arledge, then-president of ABC Sports, and Ben Chaplin is operations engineer Marvin Bader. Leonie Benesch is Marianne Gebhardt, a German-speaking interpreter who is the only person there able to understand the language of the country. She might be a bit of a composite who checks off a lot of boxes as both an entrepreneurial woman and a younger German offering perspective and insight into what this moment might mean for the country trying to put on a good front in the aftermath of World War II. An actor (Benjamin Walker) plays broadcaster Peter Jennings, and real archival footage of anchor Jim McKay from that day is used in the film.",
      "And while they all rise to the occasion, mistakes are made \u2013 including a rather big one at the end, following imperfect secondhand information from the Fuerstenfeldbruck airfield. They don\u2019t call it the first draft of history for nothing, after all, and it may be illuminating for audiences to see how it\u2019s handled.",
      "The film looks of its time, but it also feels fairly modern in its sensibilities which makes it always seem more like a re-telling than an in-the-moment experience. This may be to its detriment, yet it\u2019s still an undeniably riveting and compelling watch. The word thrilling doesn\u2019t seem appropriate, however. This is not \u201cApollo 13\u201d after all. The end is not a happy one.",
      "But at time when trust in the media is in crisis, this film is a great humanizer, reminding audiences that the media is far from a monolith, but a group of individuals under immense pressure to get the story right, get the story out and go back and do it again the next day.",
      "\u201cSeptember 5,\u201d a Paramount Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language. Running time: 94. Three stars out of four."

      "Kraven the Hunter can climb sheer walls like a gorilla, snatch fish out of streams like a bear and outrun deer",
      "Kraven the Hunter can climb sheer walls like a gorilla, snatch fish out of streams like a bear and outrun deer. But there's something this slab of human beef can't do: Anchor a decent movie.",
      "Aaron Taylor-Johnson plays the titular hero in \u201cKraven the Hunter,\u201d the sixth attempt in Sony's sputtering efforts to stock enemies for Spider-Man in movies that don't feature the webslinger. It's stuck in time, a callback to years ago when convoluted superhero origin stories were hot, and studios were dusting off even the poorest IP to tell stories.",
      "The screenplay by Richard Wenk, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway attempts to build the backstory of Kraven but soon loses interest and begins adding origin stories for third-rate bad guys, like The Rhino and The Foreigner, before introducing Chameleon right at the end, as if another Kraven movie is coming. (Sony, make it stop).",
      "Kraven, we learn, was born Sergei Kravinoff, the son of a Russian mobster who is turned into a superhero in a laughably weird plot twist. After being attacked by a lion on safari in Ghana, he's given a mystical botanical serum mixed with lion's blood and some mumbo jumbo about a tarot card. Clinically dead for three minutes, Kraven wakes up and is a world-class hunter. At least that's what he keeps saying.",
      "\u201cHunting people down is kind of my thing,\u201d he says. And later: \u201cI am the greatest hunter on the planet.\u201d Soon he's assassinating bad guys, but his motives aren't always clear. Hunting isn't exactly the same as infiltrating a high-security Siberian prison and killing a cartel boss.",
      "Director J.C. Chandor has a very lose hand, never shaping a taut narrative or reining in his actors and sometimes letting scenes just sort of drop. The additional villains distract from what seems to be a meditation on masculinity, and the special effects are jerky and ludicrous, like a fistfight between Kraven and The Rhino \u2014 somehow still wearing pants \u2014 that prompted some laughter at a recent screening.",
      "Part of the problem is that Kraven's powers aren't clearly defined. He\u2019s supposed to use animal skills to hunt, but are there many four-legged predators out there proficient with a blow dart or a pen to the trachea? He hates poachers but wears a tooth necklace and a leather bomber jacket.",
      "Kraven's eyes sometimes glow but with no apparent benefit other than to make Taylor-Johnson look even more badass as he glares into the camera, shirtless. He does have the ability to focus his attention on faraway objects, like when he spots a dropped cigarette and identifies it as a Turkish brand, a skill really low on the superhero must-haves.",
      "The movie suggests Kraven can communicate with animals, like Aquaman, but, if so, he's really, really bad at it. At best, they just sort of tolerate him. A tiger at one point jumps him and you can't blame it.",
      "Kraven has been shaped largely in opposition to his drug kingpin dad played by Russell Crowe, who has apparently watched \u201cThe Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle\u201d to nail his thick, comical Russian accent. \u201cNever fear death,\u201d he tells his son. \u201cMan who kill legend, become legend.\u201d",
      "Crowe's dad is a whisky-neat, all-testosterone, Tony Bennett-loving guy who detests any sign of weakness or kindness. He kills animals for fun, uses cocktail waitresses as human shields, doesn't pay ransoms because that makes him seem soft and dismisses his wife's suicide with the comment: \u201cShe was weak.\u201d",
      "If Crowe is cartoonish to the point of parody, Alessandro Nivola as a human-rhino hybrid makes him look like Sir Laurence Olivier. There are few instances of someone overacting more in a movie, unnecessarily adding an undercurrent of murderous, jokey psychotic to an already bizarre creation. The costume department has also dropped the ball here, giving The Rhino a small, stringed backpack that looks like it was found in the discount bins at Kohl\u2019s.",
      "Two good actors \u2014 Fred Hechinger as Kraven's younger brother and Ariana DeBose as his lawyer-ally \u2014 are left marooned in a movie that tumbles and slips to a unsatisfactory end. Is Kraven a hero or a villain? Who cares? Without Spider-Man, what's really the point, right?",
      "\u201cKraven the Hunter,\u201d a Sony Pictures release that hits theaters Friday, is rated R for \u201cstrong bloody violence and language.\u201d Running time: 127 minutes. One star out of four."

That film debuted at Sundance in 2023 before going on to collect many of the film industry\u2019s most prestigious awards, including from the Directors Guild and BAFTA. The film drew on AP reporting that also won the 2023 Pulitzer Prize for public service and featured prominently that same year in a Pulitzer for breaking news photography.",
      "The new film takes place during the failing counteroffensive and focuses on a Ukrainian platoon's mission to try to liberate a strategic village from occupation. They need to traverse \u201cone mile of heavily fortified forest,\u201d the description reads. \u201cBut the farther they advance through their destroyed homeland, the more they realize that this war may never end.\u201d",

      "The Sundance Film Festival on Wednesday unveiled its lineup of 87 feature films set to debut in January",
      "Next year's Sundance Film Festival will feature Jennifer Lopez singing and dancing in Bill Condon\u2019s \u201cKiss of the Spider Woman,\u201d Questlove exploring the legacy of Sly & The Family Stone and Associated Press journalist Mstyslav Chernov's latest documentary about the war in Ukraine.",
      "The Sundance Institute on Wednesday unveiled 87 feature films set to premiere at the 2025 festival, kicking off on Jan. 23 in Park City, Utah.",
      "Now in its 41st year, the festival remains a place of discovery for independent cinema and emerging voices. Because of its January timing, it\u2019s also a gathering that arrives alongside the presidential inauguration. At the 2017 festival following Donald Trump\u2019s first inauguration, Main Street was taken over by a lively women\u2019s march full of celebrities. This year, no such plans have been announced.",
      "\u201cSundance as a festival has endured as a place to gather through inaugurations every four years, through different cultural moments and political moments,\u201d said festival director Eugene Hernandez. \u201cWe have a program that both engages with the world and also offers at the very same time an escape.\u201d",
      "Narrative films and documentaries premiering this year will touch on politicized topics like transgender stories and rights, \u201cstand your ground\u201d laws, incarceration, the right to die and book banning. But Sundance doesn\u2019t program by theme or have mandates about topics, said Kim Yutani, the festival\u2019s director of programming.",
      "\u201cI think what you see across the program are stories that are told with real authenticity. There\u2019s an innovative quality to many of these films,\u201d Yutani said. \u201cAnd the idea of free expression is something that is just as important to us.\u201d",
      "Documentaries are always a highlight at Sundance, where the conversation starts and often continues through the year into the Oscar race. Chernov follows his Oscar winning\u201c20 Days in Mariupol\u201d with \u201c2000 Meters to Andriivka,\u201d which looks at a Ukrainian platoon on a mission to liberate a village from Russian occupation. It's a joint project between AP and PBS \u201cFrontline.\"",
      "\u201cFree Leonard Peltier\u201d looks at the Indigenous activist who has spent most of his life in prison since his conviction in the 1975 killings of two FBI agents in South Dakota. In July he was denied parole.",
      "Hernandez further spotlighted Barry Levinson and Robert May\u2019s episodic series \u201cBucks County, USA\u201d about political divides in small town America and the friendship of two teenage girls despite their opposing views.",
      "There are also several docs about famous musicians and actors including Ahmir \u201cQuestlove\u201d Thompson\u2019s \u201cSLY LIVES! (aka The Burden of Black Genius),\u201d Shoshannah Stern\u2019s \u201cMarlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore,\u201d Amy Berg\u2019s \u201cIt\u2019s Never Over, Jeff Buckley\u201d and Matt Wolf\u2019s \u201cPee-wee as Himself.\u201d Elegance Bratton also looks at the roots of house music in \u201cMove Ya Body: The Birth of House.\u201d",
      "Some performances that may have people talking into the year include: Benedict Cumberbatch in \u201cThe Thing with Feathers,\u201d about a father processing the loss of his wife; Joel Edgerton and Felicity Jones in \u201cTrain Dreams\u201d about a railroad day laborer from the \u201cSing Sing\u201d writer and director; John Lithgow and Olivia Colman as father and daughter in \u201cJimpa\u201d; Lopez in Condon\u2019s lush and vibrant musical adaptation; Lily Gladstone and Youn Yuh-jung in Andrew Ahn\u2019s \u201cThe Wedding Banquet\u201d; Josh O\u2019Connor in \u201cRebuilding\u201d; and Ben Whishaw and Rebecca Hall in \u201cPeter Hujar\u2019s Day,\u201d about New York\u2019s downtown art scene in the 1970s, from Ira Sachs.",
      "Over 40% of the films, selected from nearly 16,000 submissions, are directorial debuts, like Rachael Abigail Holder's \u201cLove, Brooklyn\u201d with Andr\u00e9 Holland.",
      "Yutani also highlighted Rashad Frett\u2019s \u201cRicky,\u201d starring Stephan James as a man trying to rebuild his life post incarceration. Another notable debut is \u201cSorry, Baby,\u201d which Eva Victor wrote, directed and stars in and Barry Jenkins produced.",
      "\u201cThere are scenes in this film that I have never seen before,\u201d Yutani said. \u201cIt was a real revelation.\u201d",
      "Film enthusiasts don\u2019t need to make the trek through the snow to pricey Park City to engage with the festival\u2019s offerings anymore. As with the past few years, about 60% of the program will be available online starting on Jan. 30. Tickets go on sale for individual films on Jan. 16 for the general public and even earlier for members.",
      "\u201cIt's a really a great opportunity to just get a sampling of what\u2019s to come in the new year for films that will travel far and wide to other festivals or make it into theaters down the line,\u201d Hernandez said.",
      "This will be one of the last years that the festival is primarily based out of Park City. Over the past year, the Sundance Institute has been exploring options for host cities starting in 2027. Finalists include Salt Lake City, Utah (with some events still in Park City), Boulder, Colorado, and Cincinnati, Ohio. An announcement is expected in the first quarter of 2025."

      "Here are some insights into the special airing Wednesday night on NBC and streaming the next day on Peacock:",
      "For years, Robinson and Motown founder Berry Gordy celebrated their success with \u201celaborate\u201d Christmas gifts for each other. But eventually, they decided to forgo the flashy exchanges.",
      "\u201cThat's what we did a long time ago,\u201d Robinson said.",
      "Now, their holiday tradition is simply catching up \u2014 whether it's over a call or casual hangout.",
      "When Bailey visited South Carolina for Christmas, her grandfather filled the house with Motown music.",
      "One of the first songs she remembers hearing the 1965 single \u201cThe Tracks of My Tears,\" composed by Robinson, Pete Moore and Marv Tarplin from the singing group, The Miracles. Another moment was when she and her sister, Chloe Bailey, performed The Supremes' 1964 track \u201cBaby Love\u201d during a talent show, sporting black sequin dresses while trying mimic their moves.",
      "\u201cThat's how I first started listening to it,\" said Halle Bailey, who starred in the Disney\u2019s live-action remake of \u201cThe Little Mermaid.\" \u201cI remember the feeling of Christmas and the music of Motown being just the beautiful background music, anytime you're opening presents. It's just amazing.\u201d",
      "More than 25 Motown songs will be on display, including classics such as: \u201cABC\"; \u201cAin\u2019t No Mountain High Enough\u201d; \u201cDancing in the Streets\u201d; \u201cI Heard It Through the Grapevine\u201d; \u201cMy Girl\u201d; \u201cReach Out (I\u2019ll be There)\u201d; and \u201cSuperstition.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhen you grow up listening to this music, it lives inside of you forever,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cIt was truly an honor to perform those songs that sang in my heart since I was a little girl.\u201d",
      "The 11-piece live band for \u201cA Motown Christmas\u201d will be led by Emmy Award-winning musical director Rickey Minor.",
      "NBC previously aired two Motown television specials, including \u201cMotown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever\u201d and \u201cMotown Returns to the Apollo,\u201d which both won Emmy Awards.",
      "When Gordy launched Motown, he gave Black musicians the platform to showcase their talents at a time when they struggled to get records played on mainstream radio stations.",
      "Gordy's label introduced and helped launch the careers of some of the biggest selling music stars from Marvin Gaye to Lionel Richie.",
      "The success of Gordy's label is captured at the Motown Museum in Detroit, the first headquarters of Gordy\u2019s music empire where Stevie Wonder, The Supremes, the Miracles and other performers recorded hits. Motown moved to California in 1972.",
      "At 84, Robinson pointed during the interview toward 24-year-old Bailey, a living testament to how Motown\u2019s magic has transcended generations.",
      "\u201cThis lady right here, she\u2019s living proof of the importance of Motown,\u201d said Robinson, who was the lead in the pioneering Motown group, the Miracles. He was once the label\u2019s vice president.",

      "NEW YORK -- George Joseph Kresge Jr., who was known to generations of TV watchers as the mesmerizing entertainer and mentalist The Amazing Kreskin, has died at age 89.",
      "Kreskin's friend and former road manager, Ryan Galway, told The Associated Press that he died Tuesday at his home in Caldwell, New Jersey, where he spent much of his life. Galway said Kreskin had not been feeling well in recent weeks but otherwise did not provide a cause of death.",
      "Inspired by the crime-fighting comic book character Mandrake the Magician, Kreskin launched his television career in the 1960s and remained popular for decades, making guest appearances on talk shows hosted by everyone from Merv Griffin to Johnny Carson to Jimmy Fallon.",
      "Fans would welcome, if not entirely figure out, his favorite mind tricks \u2014 whether correctly guessing a playing card chosen at random, or, most famously, divining where his paycheck had been planted among the audience. He also hosted his own show in the 1970s, gave live performances and wrote numerous books, including \u201cSecrets of the Amazing Kreskin\u201d and \u201cMental Power Is Real.\u201d",
      "Although he was a talk show regular, one host wasn't amused by a Kreskin stunt. In 2002, he claimed that a UFO would appear over Las Vegas on the night of June 2, and added that he would donate $50,000 to charity if he was wrong. Hundreds of people gathered in the desert, in vain. Kreskin acknowledged to radio personality Art Bell that his prediction was a hoax, a way of proving that the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks the year before had made people susceptible to manipulation. Bell called the ruse \u201clame, lame, lame\u201d and banned him from his show.",
      "Galway said that Kreskin continued to make live appearances well into his 80s, and only stopped earlier this year after injuring himself in a fall. Kreskin never married and left no immediate survivors.",
      "\u201cHis career was his life. That was his marriage,\u201d Galway said. \u201cHe was dedicated to his craft.\u201d",

      "For the Tony win, Moon, then 21, beat out stage veterans Kelli O\u2019Hara in \u201cDays of Wine and Roses,\u201d Maryann Plunkett in \u201cThe Notebook,\u201d Eden Espinosa from \u201cLempicka\u201d and Gayle Rankin from \u201cCabaret at the Kit Kat Club.\u201d",
      "Moon grew up not too far from the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood \u2014 in Franklin Township, New Jersey \u2014 with a burning ambition to be on stage and blessed with plenty of encouragement. She won the role of Dorothy for a school production of \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d at age 10 and auditioned for \u201cThe Lion King\u201d and \u201cSix\u201d on Broadway. \u201cI kind of just caught the bug,\u201d she says.",
      "A few frustrating years followed, ending when she went through the grueling audition process to earn the lead in \u201cHell's Kitchen\u201d off-Broadway three years ago, her first professional role.",
      "\u201cI did lose sight, honestly, of what made me sparkle or what made me feel like I sparkled. But this process has been such a gift in the way that it has brought me back to what made me want to do theater to begin with,\u201d she says.",
      "What's next is anyone's guess. Moon says she'd love to do film, TV and more theater: \u201cThis process has kind of showed me just how much I can connect with people through art.\u201d",
      "\u201cI want to continue to see where my heart leads me,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that\u2019s what got me here in the first place. And I hope that it carries me far in the future.\u201d",

      "Myha\u2019la is best known for playing a steely, manipulative investment banker on HBO\u2018s \u201cIndustry.\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- Myha\u2019la is best known for playing a steely, manipulative investment banker on HBO's \u201cIndustry,\u201d so the thought of her breaking into song seems antithetical.",
      "Yet the graduate of Carnegie Mellon\u2019s prestigious drama school says when she told friends and former acting teachers she landed a starring role in the series, they assumed it was a stage comedy or musical.",
      "\u201cNobody saw this trajectory for me. Not even me,\u201d Myha\u2019la told The Associated Press. \u201cThis has actually been sort of like a very happy accident and surprise that I have any career at all in TV/film. But I really, really love it and I think I\u2019m more suited for it than I thought.\u201d",
      "Although \u201cIndustry\u201d has been around since 2020, it\u2019s this year\u2019s third season that has received the most attention. Myha\u2019la sees this year as the cast and creators\u2019 \u201ccollective breakthrough,\u201d but it\u2019s her own work to find vulnerability in the unshakable, calculating, risk-loving Harper Stern that makes her one of The Associated Press\u2019 Breakthrough Entertainers of 2024.",
      "Myha\u2019la, 28, had expected and hoped to start her career in theater when she got the part in \u201cIndustry,\u201d and says she \u2014 and most of her castmates \u2014 have learned on the job. \u201cMy first time being #1 on the call sheet was a big deal,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019d all basically just come out of school and didn\u2019t know what we were doing.\u201d",
      "Though Harper regularly betrays friends and colleagues for personal gain, Myha\u2019la manages to reveal her soft edges: \u201cI don\u2019t think I could do her justice if I didn\u2019t find the humanity in her. I think, us as human beings, we hold multitudes and contradictions. We are the definition of a contradiction and that\u2019s what makes us human. So to find that in every character I play is the most important to me.\u201d",
      "Besides \u201cIndustry,\u201d she's acted in film with stars who have made an impression. She played Mahershala Ali\u2019s daughter in the Netflix science-fiction drama \u201cLeave the World Behind,\u201d with Ethan Hawke and Julia Roberts. Myha\u2019la says she was intimidated to work with \u201ca bunch of legends who\u2019ve been doing it way longer than I have.\u201d But she was pleasantly surprised at how they embraced her. \u201cThey treated me like I was just another person in the cast, not a child, not inexperienced, not a junior. None of that,\u201d Myha\u2019la remembered.",
      "Roberts has become a role model after Myha\u2019la observed how she treated everyone on set.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s incredibly patient. She doesn\u2019t behave like she\u2019s the icon that she is,\u201d the actor said. \u201cA generous, respectful person who has integrity. And I really love the way people responded to her. That\u2019s \u2026 the person I want to be. I want to come in and command a room with kindness and do my job really well.\u201d",
      "Doing her job well landed her roles in two notable films coming next year \u2014 \u201cSwiped,\u201d with Lily James starring as the founder of Bumble, and \u201cThey Will Kill You,\u201d with Zazie Beetz \u2014 in addition to the fourth season of \u201cIndustry.\u201d",
      "Myha\u2019la\u2019s personal life also blossomed this year when she got engaged to her boyfriend of four years. She loves telling the story of their ultimate meet-cute, which started when he direct messaged her on Instagram during the pandemic saying he was an \u201cIndustry\u201d fan.",
      "\u201cHe was incredibly invested in me, and not in a creepy way \u2014 in a really sincere, curious way. And I was so struck by that,\u201d she said.",
      "Grateful for the TV and film roles, Myha\u2019la still holds out hope that one day she\u2019ll make her Broadway debut. \u201cThe dream is not dead!\u201d she said with a smile.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Aaron Pierre is closing out his big year on a literal high note.",
      "After donning Malcolm X\u2019s distinctive browline glasses in the \u201cGenius: MLK/X\u201d series and getting his modern-day Rambo on in the Netflix action hit \u201cRebel Ridge,\u201d the 30-year-old English actor showcases his vocal talents in \u201cMufasa: The Lion King.\u201d",
      "To deliver as the titular regal lion, Pierre trained under Lin-Manuel Miranda in what he calls a \u201cwonderful singing boot camp.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy voice was doing things I never imagined it could do. I was hitting notes that I didn\u2019t think existed for my range,\u201d Pierre said. \u201cI\u2019m just really hoping the footage of me singing these songs doesn\u2019t come out because I\u2019m using all the techniques. Lin\u2019s like \u2018Throw the baseball!\u2019 So I\u2019m throwing the baseball trying to hit that high note.\u201d",
      "His Hollywood trajectory keeps going up: He's been named one of The Associated Press' Breakthrough Entertainers of 2024 and HBO announced in October that, opposite Kyle Chandler, Pierre will lead \u201cLanterns.\u201d",
      "That\u2019ll be the broad-shouldered, hazel-eyed actor\u2019s second DC Comics-based series, following his 2018-2019 run on SyFy\u2019s \u201cKrypton,\u201d which explored early days on Superman\u2019s home planet.",
      "As for Pierre\u2019s own origin story: He grew up in South London as the oldest of three, with childhood aspirations of being a track star and a criminologist. At 13, he joined a local theater troupe that performed in a warehouse, sometimes with just several people in the audience.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s actually where I learned some of my foundations. And one of those is irrespective of whether there is one person in the audience or 1,500 people ... you give the same performance, you give the same energy,\u201d Pierre said.",
      "Mark \u201cMoonlight\u201d and \u201cMufasa\u201d director Barry Jenkins down as impressed by that energy. After watching Pierre play Cassio in the Globe Theatre\u2019s \u201cOthello,\u201d Jenkins cast him as Caesar in \u201cThe Underground Railroad.\u201d The small part grew and grew after Pierre arrived on set in Atlanta.",
      "\u201cI found myself just creating scenes for him,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cYou know, that character is in the show for much longer, much longer than his character exists in the narrative (Colson Whitehead\u2019s novel). He just keeps reappearing. And that\u2019s just because it was just a joy to work with him. And it was so clear that his presence was just immediately a part of the spiritual essence of the show.\u201d",
      "Counting Denzel Washington, James Earl Jones and Sidney Poitier as career role models, Pierre has been deliberate with his choices as he moves deeper into stardom. Art is the end goal \u2014 not fame or even fun, really. He hopes new fans go back to watch his 2022 indie \u201cBrother,\u201d about family bonds in 1990s Toronto.",
      "\u201cI always want my community to feel seen. I want them to feel respected. I want them to feel heard and understood. And I think the projects that I choose, that\u2019s my small contribution hopefully to that manifesting itself,\u201d he said.",
      "Pierre, now living mostly in Los Angeles, says he's been reaching out regularly to his mom back in London as he navigates the Hollywood circuit.",
      "\u201cAny time I speak with her, any time I\u2019m present with her, I feel safe. I feel reassured, I feel rejuvenated,\u201d he said. \u201cI definitely call her phone a lot and she\u2019ll answer even if she\u2019s at work. Yes, I\u2019m 30 and 6-foot-3 and doing Terry Richmond in \u2018Rebel Ridge.\u2019 But like to me, I\u2019m still her baby and I\u2019m still her little boy and she always makes time for me, no matter what the situation.\u201d",
      "Both on and off-set, Pierre carries himself with a sense of purpose and seriousness. \u201cI don\u2019t know that there\u2019s anything frivolous about Aaron Pierre, even in downtime, which is \u2014 I mean that as a compliment,\u201d Jenkins said.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s very intellectually engaged. But he also looks like a superhero. And there\u2019s a version of him that is only viewed that way. He\u2019s always diligent about protecting against that by doing things that are maybe a bit outside the box,\u201d Jenkins added. \u201cAnd for me, I just hope that he gets to grow and express himself in all the different ways that I think he\u2019s capable of.\u201d",
      "Indeed, when asked about his aspirations for future creative collaborators, the first name out of Pierre's mouth might surprise: \u201cWomen Talking\u201d writer-director Sarah Polley.",
      "\u201cIf you could put a word in for me, please,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cYeah, just to continue to work with filmmakers who inspired me and whose work I admire and respect and that will inevitably put me in a situation where I\u2019m forced to evolve and develop and grow and challenge myself as an actor. And I want to be doing that until the day that I decide to stop doing this,\u201d Pierre added. \u201cI want to always feel like I\u2019m growing, like I\u2019m shifting the needle. You know, I never want to feel stagnant. I never want to feel comfortable.\u201d",

      "\u201cI thought that looked really fun. And now I kind of feel like I work in the circus,\u201d Hechinger told The Associated Press, which selected him as one of its Breakthrough Entertainers of 2024.",
      "Levity suits the 25-year-old, despite his role as the tyrannical Emperor Caracalla in \u201cGladiator II.\u201d While his year \u2014 which has included the highly praised \u201cThelma,\u201d with June Squibb \u2014 has been \u201cfun and busy,\u201d Hechinger says, it also \u201cfeels in some ways like a reflective year at the moment.\u201d",

      "Nicholas Alexander Chavez starred in two Ryan Murphy shows this fall",
      "It's not an exaggeration to say Nicholas Alexander Chavez had a very good year.",
      "Now a member of Ryan Murphy's unofficial acting troupe, he starred in two of the creator's new series. First came the Golden Globe-nominated \u201cMonsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story,\u201d for Netflix. Chavez played Lyle, the elder of two brothers serving a lifetime prison sentence for killing their parents, Jose and Kitty, in 1989.",
      "Chavez recognizes some parts of the series are \u201creally, really difficult to digest\u201d but points out that \u201cMonsters\u201d shows multiple sides to the story. The brothers have said they killed their parents out of self-defense, following sexual abuse by their father.",
      "\u201cTo my knowledge, it\u2019s the first TV show about the Menendez brothers that\u2019s told in that format,\u201d said Chavez, who prepared by watching old court footage. (The drama \u2014 and a new documentary \u2014 reignited public interest in the case, and a judge is weighing Los Angeles County prosecutors' request to resentence the brothers.)",
      "It was toward the end of filming \u201cMonsters\u201d that Murphy invited Chavez to join Niecy Nash in \u201cGrotesquerie,\u201d a double act that earned him a spot as one of The Associated Press\u2019 Breakthrough Entertainers of 2024.",
      "\u201cI was just so excited that he thought of me,\u201d said Chavez of the opportunity. \u201cI had studied Season 1 of \u2018Monsters.\u2019\u201d The opportunity to act with Nash, says Chavez, \u201cwas really kind of a wonderful way for me to close the loop.\u201d To get into character as Father Charlie, Chavez would listen to music: \u201cDon\u2019t Do Anything Illegal\u201d by Charles Manson \u2014 yes, that one \u2014 was on his playlist.",
      "Even before the Murphyverse, the 25-year-old had a loyal following from his work on ABC\u2019s \u201cGeneral Hospital,\u201d TV\u2019s longest-running soap. Chavez was selling cars during the pandemic when he auditioned for and got a part on the daytime show. He played Spencer Cassadine, a grandson of legacy character Laura of the Luke and Laura days. A year later, he won the 2022 Daytime Emmy Award for outstanding younger performer in a drama series.",
      "Of the training that actors get from soap operas, Chavez said the series helped him: \u201cIt\u2019s no joke when they talk about the memorization. I think that my heaviest day on set was something like 85 pages.\u201d",
      "A career in acting wasn't on Chavez's radar until he played Atticus Finch in his high school production of \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird.\u201d",
      "\u201cI just really, really enjoyed myself,\u201d recalled Chavez. \u201cI felt really free and present and immersed in the moment. It felt like I was doing the thing that I was put on earth to do.\u201d",
      "He remembers being told afterward by teachers that he should pursue acting as a career. Their encouragement stuck with him: \u201cNot many kids in Denver got told this. It\u2019s not really a part of the infrastructure the way that it is in LA or maybe in New York.\u201d",
      "Cooper Koch, who played Erik Menendez in \u201cMonsters,\u201d credits Chavez\u2019s layered performance in the series. He recalls a scene when his character confesses to the crimes in a therapy session. Lyle bursts through the door to stop him.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s sort of pleading with the doctor like, \u2018We\u2019re going to be OK, right? You can\u2019t tell anyone,\u2019\u201d Koch said. \u201cAfter we cut, me and Nick and our director of photography, Jason McCormick, sort of huddled up outside and we just started crying. It was so beautiful. And I really, really saw his (Lyle\u2019s) humanity and the lion mask kind of come off and he became this wounded child. It was so, so beautiful to witness.\u201d",
      "Next, Chavez has a role in the \u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer\u201d reboot. He also says he would like to get cast in a comedy. More than anything, he just wants to be on set working.",
      "\u201cMy life feels whole and complete between the words \u2018action\u2019 and \u2018cut.\u2019 I live for those moments,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that is the purpose of my entire existence. I can\u2019t wait to see what the future holds.\u201d",

      "Arjona would perform for her family members, but it was in her adolescent years that art classes gave her confidence in her craft. Still, the actor of Puerto Rican and Guatemalan descent constantly tried to prove herself as an artist and an actor. Arjona doesn\u2019t take it lightly that she is one of the few Latina actors cast in multidimensional roles.",
      "\u201cI always put this pressure on myself of making a difference for Latin Americans in cinema, just playing different roles and trying not to get stereotyped ... it took me a long time,\u201d she said.",
      "Her long-term dream is to see more varied Latin American stories on screen. That's what drew her to \u201cLos Frikis,\u201d the coming-of-age story about a punk rock group set in early 1990s Cuba that she co-stars in and executive produces.",
      "\u201cI just hope that it gets less and less complicated and that the opportunities of playing real dimensional characters just doesn\u2019t stop,\u201d she said.",
      "She quickly learned to advocate for herself in Hollywood and credits collaborators like Linklater for believing in her and presenting her the opportunity to flex her writing skills. While working on \u201cHit Man,\u201d Arjona contributed to the second part of the comedy\u2019s script \u2014 something Powell also noted.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s also incredibly generous as an actor; her off-camera takes were just as electric as her on-camera moments,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Arjona is at a pivotal moment in her career. With multiple projects on the horizon, like \u201cSplitsville\u201d and A24's \u201cOnslaught,\u201d she is enjoying acting and producing and says she's open to writing and directing if presented with the right opportunity.",
      "She attributes her openness to some early advice from her father, Grammy-winning recording artist Ricardo Arjona, who reminded her to never stop learning.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t pretend that you know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d he told her. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest mistake you can do. Always ask for help and ask questions and you\u2019ll learn faster that way instead of pretending.\u201d",
      "She's taken her father\u2019s advice, soaking in every moment on set and continuously falling in love with the process. She still gets butterflies on her first day.",
      "\u201cI still feel nervous,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope I always stay nervous. I think it\u2019s a sign that I really care, and I still really enjoy what I\u2019m doing.\u201d",

      "GloRilla went from being a choir girl to a husky-voiced rap queen, climbing the hip-hop ranks so high that she\u2019s earned a trip to the White House",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 GloRilla has gone from choir girl to husky-voiced rap queen, climbing the hip-hop ranks so high that she\u2019s earned a trip to the White House.",
      "The Memphis-born performer has become one of industry\u2019s most promising voices with her genuine character, rap flow and unmistakable Southern drawl. She established herself this year as a proven hitmaker with \u201cWanna Be\u201d featuring Megan Thee Stallion and the breakout hit \u201cYeah Glo!,\u201d which earned two nominations at the upcoming Grammys.",
      "The rapper\u2019s mentality this year has been to \u201cput your foot on the gas and don\u2019t let up,\u201d she told The Associated Press.",
      "In 2024 alone, she's been a guest performer on the domestic leg of Megan's Hot Girl Summer Tour, gaining more confidence performing in sold-out arenas. She's performed at a star-studded party in front of celebrities ranging from Leonardo DiCaprio to Kim Kardashian, and met with President Joe Biden during a women's history month event.",
      "All of this came before the October release of her critically acclaimed debut album \u201cGlorious,\u201d whose \u201cTGIF\u201d had Rihanna dancing in a social media post, earning GloRilla a spot as one of the AP's Breakthrough Entertainers of 2024.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t ever get too comfortable,\u201d said the rapper, who burst onto the hip-hop scene in 2022 with \u201cTomorrow\u201d and the Grammy-nominated \u201cF.N.F. (Let\u2019s Go).\u201d \u201cTake advantage of everything that comes your way. If you drive and apply yourself, it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d",
      "GloRilla's humble beginnings served as a driving force to chase bigger horizons. Born Gloria Hallelujah Woods (the stage name was a cousin's suggestion), the 25-year-old credits her mother and her church-centered upbringing for preparing her for this pivotal moment in her life.",
      "\u201cMy momma always told me to be humble and grateful,\u201d she said. \u201cI come from nothing almost. My mom is well mannered. My mom taught us right, like, internally, have a great spirit. My personality and spirit come from my momma.\u201d",
      "GloRilla is still adjusting to her rising fame while dealing with some controversies. She was left \u201cheartbroken\u201d after three women were killed in a deadly stampede toward the end of a 2023 concert in upstate New York in which investigators found no criminal wrongdoing. She faced backlash for using a disability-related slur in her lyrics and was charged with drunken driving in Georgia this year.",
      "Despite that, her profile has grown in recent months to become one of rap's biggest names \u2014 thanks to something rapper Yo Gotti spotted when he signed her to his Collective Music Group label in 2022.",
      "\u201cIt's the authenticity,\u201d said Yo Gotti, a fellow Memphis native. \u201cEven when she talks about the struggles throughout this journey, it\u2019s refreshing. I don\u2019t think many artists do that. Everybody wants to play perfect. I think that\u2019s why so many people gravitate to her. She relates to real people.\u201d",
      "While she enjoys snapping photos with fans, she opts for incognito mode on her more casual days: \u201cI don\u2019t like to tell people \u2018No.\u2019 I don\u2019t want to be mean to my fans. That's probably the worst part. I hate taking pictures when I'm not prepared.\u201d",
      "Seeking a career role model, GloRilla often examines the work ethic of Beyonc\u00e9, who called the rapper one of her favorite young artists.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s a businesswoman. She multitasks a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s something I have to get better at. She\u2019s a super hard worker. Her work ethic is crazy.\u201d",
      "GloRilla could follow Beyonc\u00e9's footsteps as an actor. Since childhood, she's dreamed of starring in a film or TV show \u2014 though she's bracing herself for the marathon days on set that come with it.",
      "\u201cThink I\u2019m still going to do it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to lie. When I\u2019m on those music video sets, I be like \u2018I don\u2019t know if I can do acting.\u2019 I can only imagine how many times I got to say the script and memorize in my head. I don\u2019t know. ... But I'm going to still try it.\u201d",

    "summary": "Some early breast cancer patients can safely avoid certain surgeries",
    "story": [
      "Some early breast cancer patients can safely avoid certain surgeries",
      "Some early breast cancer patients can safely avoid specific surgeries, according to two studies exploring ways to lessen treatment burdens.",
      "One new study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, examines whether removing lymph nodes is always necessary in early breast cancer. Another in the Journal of the American Medical Association suggests a new approach to a type of breast cancer called ductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS.",
      "The research was discussed Thursday at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium.",
      "Every year, about 50,000 women in the U.S. are diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS, where the cells that line milk ducts become cancerous, but the nearby breast tissue remains healthy. Many choose to have surgery, although it\u2019s unclear whether they could instead take a \u201cwait-and-see\u201d approach with more frequent monitoring.",
      "The new study, based on two years of data, suggests that such active monitoring is a safe alternative to surgery for many of these women, though some doctors will want to see if the results hold up over time.",
      "\u201cThis is an option that patients should consider for their DCIS,\u201d said Dr. Virginia Kaklamani of the University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio, who was not involved in the research. \u201cFor a long time, we\u2019ve had the feeling that we\u2019re overtreating some patients with DCIS. This is a confirmation of what we suspected is happening.\u201d",
      "Taking a more cautious view, Dr. Monica Morrow of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, who was not involved in the study, said a two-year study isn't long enough to draw conclusions.",
      "The finding is based on following more than 950 U.S. patients randomly assigned to surgery or active monitoring. All had low-risk DCIS with no sign of invasive cancer. They had the type of DCIS that responds to hormone-blocking drugs and many in the study took those drugs as part of their treatment.",
      "After two years, the rates of invasive cancer were low and did not differ significantly between the groups, with about 6% in the surgery group and about 4% in the monitoring group diagnosed with invasive cancer.",
      "Among patients in the monitoring group, changes spotted on a mammogram would prompt a biopsy. They also could opt for surgery at any time for any reason.",
      "Some study participants didn\u2019t stick with the treatment they were randomly assigned. So in a separate analysis looking at those who actually had surgery or not, the rates of invasive cancer were about 9% for the surgery group and 3% for the monitoring group.",
      "The researchers will continue to follow the patients to see if the finding holds up over a decade.",
      "Tina Clark, 63, of Buxton, Maine, joined the study after being diagnosed with DCIS in 2019. Randomly assigned to the monitoring-only group, she was able to avoid surgery and radiation during a time when she was raising a teenage nephew and going through the illness and death of her husband.",
      "\u201cI feel just so grateful and fortunate that I found this study when I did,\u201d Clark said.",
      "She has mammograms every six months to keep watch on the DCIS in her right breast, which has not advanced. The mammograms spotted a small cancer in her other breast in 2023, unrelated to the DCIS. She had a lumpectomy to remove it.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re diagnosed with low-risk DCIS, you have time to understand more about your disease and understand what your options are,\u201d said study author Dr. Shelley Hwang of Duke University School of Medicine.",
      "Women having surgery for breast cancer often also have what\u2019s called a sentinel lymph node biopsy where a few lymph nodes in the armpit are removed to check for spreading cancer.",
      "But removing lymph nodes can cause lasting pain and arm swelling, so research is underway to determine when it can be avoided. A study in Europe last year showed that older women with small tumors could safely avoid the added surgery.",
      "In the new study, researchers in Germany looked at whether women with early breast cancer who were planning to have breast-conserving surgery could safely skip having lymph nodes removed. They followed 4,858 women who were randomly assigned to have lymph nodes removed or not.",
      "After five years, about 92% of women in both groups were still alive and free of cancer.",
      "\u201cRemoving lymph nodes does not improve survival, and the risk of cancer coming back in the armpit is quite low when lymph nodes are not removed,\u201d said Morrow, who added that some women will still need the lymph node procedure to help determine which treatment drugs they should take after surgery.",

      "BAYELSA, Nigeria -- Ominike Marvis has lost count of the number of times her 6-year-old son has had malaria. So when Nigeria started offering a malaria vaccine, she was eager to protect her youngest child.",
      "She took the 6-month-old baby to get his first shot at a health center in hard-hit Bayelsa state, where the country's vaccination campaign kicked off last week. The vaccine aims to prevent severe illnesses and deaths from the mosquito-borne disease.",
      "\u201cAt least I know he\u2019s safe from it now,\u201d Marvis, 31, said.",
      "Africa accounts for the vast majority of malaria in the world. Nigeria, the continent's most populous country, has the biggest burden with about a quarter of the cases.",
      "According to a World Health Organization report released Wednesday, there were an estimated 263 million cases of malaria and 597,000 deaths worldwide last year, mostly in children under 5. That is 11 million more malaria cases compared to 2022 with nearly the same number of deaths.",
      "\u201cNo one should die of malaria, yet the disease continues to disproportionately harm people living in the African region, especially young children and pregnant women,\u201d said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, calling for more support.",
      "There are now 17 countries giving new malaria vaccines to young children, the WHO report said. Nigeria began its campaign last week, offering a vaccine developed by Oxford University.",
      "Research suggests it is more than 75% effective at preventing severe disease and death in the first year and that protection is extended for at least another year with a booster.",
      "Nigeria\u2019s health minister, Muhammad Ali Pate, called the vaccination campaign a \u201cmonumental step\u201d in the country\u2019s efforts to eliminate malaria.",
      "The disease is caused by a parasite that is spread through mosquito bites. Experts say other measures like bed nets and insecticide spraying remain essential to curb the disease.",
      "Experts say Nigeria's population of more than 210 million people, as well as its climate, contribute to its high malaria burden, but so do other factors like poor sanitation and limited tools like treated bed nets.",
      "Besides the lack of funding, WHO report said countries with malaria still grapple with fragile health systems, weak surveillance and drug and insecticide resistance.",
      "But progress has also been made on several fronts, the report said, including in the African region where countries have achieved a 16% reduction in malaria deaths since 2015. And in 83 countries where malaria is present, 25 of them now report fewer than 10 cases a year, the report said.",
      "In the oil-rich but poor Bayelsa state, among the worst-hit in Nigeria, malaria is so common in riverside communities that mothers spoke of how no one in their family has been spared.",
      "\u201cHere, malaria is something we are used to,\u201d said Claris Okah, a community health worker.",
      "Among the challenges health workers like Okah face is hesitancy among parents, so they are educating families about the new vaccine and other steps to prevent malaria.",

      "Fewer grandparents were taking care of grandchildren, there was a decline in the number of preschoolers and more people were staying put in their homes in the first part of the 2020s compared with the last part of the 2010s",
      "Fewer grandparents were living with and taking care of grandchildren, there was a decline in young children going to preschool and more people stayed put in their homes in the first part of the 2020s compared with the last part of the 2010s, according to U.S. Census Bureau data released Thursday, reflecting some of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "The latest figures from the most comprehensive survey of American life compare the years 2014-2018 and 2019-2023, timeframes before the COVID-19 pandemic and during the virus' spread. The American Community Survey data show how lives were changed and family relationships altered by the pandemic and other occurrences like the opioid crisis.",
      "The survey of 3.5 million households covers more than 40 topics, including ancestry, fertility, marital status, commutes, veterans status, disability and housing.",
      "The decrease in grandparents' taking care of their grandchildren is most likely because opioid-related deaths stabilized and then declined during the more recent timeframe since substance abuse is a leading reason grandparents find themselves raising grandchildren. A reduction in the number of incarcerated women also likely played a role, said Susan Kelley, a professor emerita of nursing at Georgia State University.",
      "\u201cIt's very rarely for positive reasons that grandparents find themselves in this situation. Usually, it's a tragic situation in an adult child's life \u2014 either a death, incarceration or mental health issues which correlate with substance abuse,\" Kelley said. \"Many grandparents thrive in that role, but there are still socioeconomic and emotional burdens on the grandparents.\"",
      "A stronger economy in the most recent period also may be a reason the number of grandparents living with their grandchildren declined from 7.2 million to 6.8 million by making it less likely that adult children with their own children were seeking housing help from their parents, she said.",
      "The decline in the number of young children enrolled in preschool stemmed from an unwillingness to send young children to school and the closure of many schools at the height of the pandemic, according to the Census Bureau.",
      "\u201cThese data show how the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on patterns of early childhood education,\u201d the bureau said in a separate report. \"Future research will show if this was the start of a long-term trend or if enrollment will bounce back to prior levels.\"",
      "Americans continued to get older, with the median age rising to 38.7 from 37.9 and the nation's share of senior citizens hitting 16.8% from 15.2%. The share of households with a computer jumped to almost 95% from nearly 89%, as did the share of households with a broadband connection to almost 90% from 80%.",
      "Additionally, fewer people moved and more people stayed put in the most recent time period compared with the earlier one, in many cases because of rising home values and the limited availability of homes to buy.",
      "Home values increased by 21.7% and the percentage of vacant homes dropped from 12.2% to 10.4%. The median home value jumped from $249,400 to $303,400 nationwide.",
      "In some vacation communities popular with the wealthy, the bump was even more dramatic, such as in the county that is home to Aspen, Colorado, where it went from $758,800 to $1.1 million, and in the county which is home to Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, where it jumped from $812,400 to $1.1 million.",

    "story": [
      "Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes says she is suing a Saudi Arabian agribusiness over what she calls \u201cexcessive pumping\u201d of groundwater",
      "PHOENIX -- Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes announced Wednesday she's suing a Saudi Arabian agribusiness for allegedly violating a public nuisance law, contending that its groundwater pumping threatens the public health, safety and infrastructure of local communities in a rural western county.",
      "The complaint filed in Maricopa County Superior Court alleges that the pumping at a Fondomonte Arizona, LLC. alfalfa farm has had widespread effects in the Ranegras Plain Basin of La Paz County, harming everyone who depends on basin water by drawing down supplies, drying up wells and causing the ground to crack and sink in some areas.",
      "The lawsuit is the latest action by Arizona against foreign companies that use huge amounts of groundwater to grow thirsty forage crops for export because of climate challenges in other countries. Rural Arizona is especially attractive to international businesses because it has no groundwater pumping regulations.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that since 2014, Fondomonte has extracted huge amounts of water that accelerated depletion of the basin\u2019s aquifer. The company is a subsidiary of Saudi dairy giant Almarai Co.",
      "\u201cWe find the allegations of the Attorney General totally unfounded, and we will defend any potential action against Fondomonte and our rights vigorously before the competent authorities,\u201d Fondomonte said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThe company has invested significantly to bring the latest conservation technology and applies environmentally sustainable practices on these long-established farms,\u201d it said. \u201cFondomonte has continued to develop responsibly during its time farming in the state and the company complies with all state regulations. \u201d",
      "Years of drought have increased pressure on water users across the West, particularly in states like Arizona, which relies heavily on the dwindling Colorado River. The drought has also made groundwater \u2014 long used by farmers and rural residents without restriction \u2014 even more important for users across the state.",
      "\u201cProtection of Arizona\u2019s precious groundwater is certainly important, but this lawsuit could open a can of worms,\u201d said Kathryn Sorensen, director of the Kyl Center for Water Policy at Arizona State University. \u201cNearly every farm, city, mine, tribe, and power company in the state relies on groundwater.\u201d",
      "Water attorneys said they did not feel qualified to address the legal theory of public nuisance but emphasized the lack of regulation of groundwater pumping in rural Arizona.",
      "Kathleen Ferris, an attorney and Arizona water policy expert who directed the study that led to the current law overseeing the state\u2019s groundwater management, said rural groundwater use in the state \u201cis \u201cgoverned by the rule of reasonable use.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnyone may drill a well and pump groundwater as long as the use of the groundwater is reasonable,\u201d said Ferris, a senior research fellow at the Kyl Center. \u201cUnfortunately, no use of groundwater has been determined by the courts to be \u2018unreasonable.\u2019 It\u2019s basically a rule that benefits the biggest landowners with the deepest wells.\u2019\u201d",
      "Mayes told reporters Wednesday that the Arizona Legislature has done nothing to fix the groundwater problem despite knowing about the problem for years.",
      "\u201cWhile laws regulating groundwater pumping could have prevented this situation, the legislature\u2019s inaction has allowed the crisis to grow,\u201d Mayes said. \u201cWhen the legislature fails to protect our most basic resources, the attorney general must step in.\u201d",
      "La Paz County Supervisor Holly Irwin, a Republican, commended Mayes, a Democrat, for attempting to address what she described as her community\u2019s \u201cmost challenging\u201d concern.",
      "\u201cI know that my constituents will be thrilled over this, that somebody is actually paying attention to the real problems here,\u201d Irwin said during Wednesday\u2019s news briefing via a video conference call.",

      "Growing demand for the lithium used in batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage has created a new frontier for mining in Nigeria",
      "NASARAWA, Nigeria -- Growing demand for the lithium used in batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage has created a new frontier for mining in Nigeria.",
      "But it\u2019s led to exploitation of children who are often poor and take work in small, illegal mines to support themselves and their families.",
      "The Associated Press recently traveled to the deep bush of Pasali, near the federal capital of Abuja in Nasarawa state, to follow and interview miners operating illegal mines, including some where children work. AP also witnessed negotiations and an agreement to purchase lithium by a Chinese company with no questions about the source of the lithium or how it was obtained.",
      "The International Labour Organization estimates more than 1 million children work in mines and quarries worldwide, a problem particularly acute in Africa, where poverty, limited access to education and weak regulations add to the problem. Children, working mostly in small-scale mines, work long hours at unsafe sites, crushing or sorting rocks, carrying heavy loads of ore, and exposing themselves to toxic dust that can cause respiratory problems and asthma.",
      "Some takeaways from AP's report:",
      "Lithium mining began in Pasali a decade ago, transforming a remote and slumbering community into a bustling site for small-scale illegal mining, said Shedrack Bala, a 25-year-old who began working in the mines at age 15 and now owns his own pit. Dozens of mines now dot the area, all unlicensed.",
      "The mining methods are primitive and dangerous. Miners use chisels and heavy hammers to break through rocks, descending several feet into dark pits. In some old but still viable mines, they crawl through narrow passages snaking between unstable mud walls before starting to dig. For new mines, the ground is blasted open with dynamite.",
      "Bashir Rabiu, now 19, started in the pits as an underage worker. AP journalists watched as he wriggled around at the bottom of a pit, where miners can be at risk if dynamite explodes prematurely. They also face danger of suffocating in narrow tunnels that connect pits, or burial from wall collapse.",
      "Rabiu hauled up raw lithium ore and passed it to six children, all younger than 10. Wearing rubber slippers and dust-stained shorts and shirts, the children hunched over rubble and chipped away with crude stone tools to extract valuable fragments.",
      "A team of six children can sort and bag up to 10 25-kilogram bags of lithium-rich rock a day. For working from early morning to late evening, the children typically share 4,000 naira (about $2.42), according to Bala and others who use them.",
      "None of the children in the group AP saw was attending school. Only two ever had. One, a 5-year-old boy, stopped when he was orphaned. The other was a 6-year-old girl who was pulled out of school by her family, who felt they couldn't afford to send two children to school and prioritized her 11-year-old brother.",
      "The illegal mining thrives on informal networks of buyers and sellers who operate without much fear of the government. Aliyu Ibrahim, a lithium merchant in Nasarawa, owns unlicensed mines and also buys lithium ore from other illegal sites. At his warehouse, he told AP that his business flourishes by paying officials to look the other way. Ibrahim said he then sells his lithium in bulk to Chinese companies.",
      "Ibrahim said he knows that children are working at his mines and others he buys from, but he said many of the children are orphans or poor. He said the work helps them survive.",
      "AP accompanied miners from Pasali illegal mines to Chinese-owned RSIN Nigeria Limited, where a sales agreement was reached without questions about the source of the minerals or the conditions under which they were extracted. Sellers were asked to leave samples to test for lithium content. A price list from the buyers offered 200,000 naira (about $119) for a metric ton of minerals containing up to 3% lithium.",
      "RSIN Nigeria Limited did not respond to repeated requests for comment. But in a statement to AP, the Chinese embassy in Abuja said Chinese mining companies in Nigeria \u201coperate in line with local laws and regulations.\u201d",
      "Philip Jakpor, a Nigerian activist, said his nonprofit Renevlyn Development Initiative has documented widespread child labor practices across Nasarawa state.",
      "\u201cRevenue generation seems to have trumped the need to protect human rights,\u201d Jakpor said. \u201cWe expect those operating in the upper spheres of the supply chain to adopt responsible models that prevent abusive conditions in mineral extraction.\u201d",
      "Juliane Kippenberg, associate director of children\u2019s rights at Human Rights Watch, said global demand for lithium is expected to grow rapidly in coming years and it's imperative for governments to protect human rights and press corporations to do the same.",
      "Segun Tomori, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Mining and Solid Minerals Development, said ongoing reforms such as amending the Minerals and Mining Act are aimed at minimizing the use of child labor. Tomori also said social safety programs such as school feeding initiatives are being revamped to keep children in school and combat child labor.

      "Rabiu hauled up raw lithium ore and passed it to Juliet and five other children, all younger than 10. Wearing rubber slippers and dust-stained shorts and shirts, the children hunched over heaps of rubble and chipped away with crude stone tools to extract valuable fragments. Once sorted, the minerals were bagged to begin their journey from Pasali to the global supply chain.",
      "A team of six children can sort and bag up to 10 25-kilogram bags of lithium-rich rock a day. When the AP visited, they did 22 kilograms (about 48.5 pounds) in one hour. For working from early morning to late evening, the children typically share 4,000 naira (about $2.42), according to Bala and others who use them. They said it is enough money to cover meals at the children\u2019s homes.",

Juliet was pulled out because her family couldn't afford to send both her and her 11-year-old brother, and his education took precedence, her mother said.",
      "Basic education is supposed to be free in Nigeria, at least in government schools like the one in Pasali. But hidden fees often put it out of reach of the poorest families. For example, in Pasali, a Parent-Teacher Association levy of 5,000 Naira (about $3) is charged per term, parents said. For Juliet\u2019s family and others, even this amount is too much. About 63% of Nigeria's population lives in poverty.",
      "Sule Dantini, the schoolmaster, said his classes have become virtually empty with only three pupils turning up when he spoke with AP in early December. \u201cI used to have up to 300 pupils, but attendance has been very poor because of mining.\u201d He denied the school charges fees.",
      "Nigeria is Africa\u2019s top oil producer, but it also has deep mineral resources including granite, limestone, and gold, and it's seeking to tap those to reduce its reliance on petroleum exports. Yet much of this wealth \u2014 including lithium \u2014 is siphoned off through unlicensed mines that cost the nation billions of dollars and drive insecurity, according to a parliamentary probe this year.",

      "China's citizens and companies are frequently in the spotlight for environmentally damaging practices, exploitative labor and illicit mining in several countries. Nigeria has seen multiple cases of illegal mining arrests and prosecutions involving Chinese nationals in recent months. Experts say the materials are exported in a variety of ways, including shipping with false documentation or concealment within legitimate shipments.",

      "The Montana Supreme Court is continuing to block a law that sought to ban gender-affirming medical care for minors while it goes through the courts",
      "HELENA, Mont. -- A Montana law banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors will remain temporarily blocked, the state Supreme Court ruled Wednesday, after justices unanimously agreed with a lower court judge who found the law likely violates the state's constitutional right to privacy.",
      "The case against the Montana law now goes to trial before District Court Judge Jason Marks in Missoula.",
      "\u201cI will never understand why my representatives are working to strip me of my rights and the rights of other transgender kids,\u201d Phoebe Cross, a 17-year-old transgender boy and lead plaintiff, said in a statement. \u201cJust living as a trans teenager is difficult enough, the last thing me and my peers need is to have our rights taken away.\u201d",
      "The attorney general's office said it looks forward to defending the law, with a spokesperson noting there are recent scientific and legal developments that fall in the state's favor. This comes as the British government on Wednesday indefinitely banned puberty blockers for children with gender dysphoria, citing an unacceptable safety risk.",
      "\u201cIn upholding the district court\u2019s flawed decision to temporarily block a duly enacted law, the Supreme Court put the wellbeing of children -- who have yet to reach puberty -- at risk by allowing experimental treatments that could leave them to deal with serious and irreversible consequences for the rest of their lives to continue,\u201d spokesperson Chase Scheuer said.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court earlier this month heard arguments over Tennessee\u2019s ban on puberty blockers, hormones or surgery for transgender minors, with observers saying it appeared the justices were likely to uphold the ban. The Biden administration had sought to block similar bans that exist in more than half the states.",
      "\u201cBecause Montana's constitutional protections are even stronger than their federal counterparts, transgender youth in Montana can sleep easier tonight knowing that they can continue to thrive for now, without this looming threat hanging over their heads,\u201d said Kell Olsen, an attorney for Lambda Legal.",
      "Republican Sen. John Fuller, who sponsored the bill, said Wednesday's decision \u201cis an egregious example of the hyperpartisanship of the Montana Supreme Court.\" He criticized the courts for upholding the \u201cability to sterilize and mutilate children\u201d and denying protection to children \"from unscientific and experimental drugs and operations that have grown increasingly evident as a danger to children.\u201d",
      "Fuller hasn't decided if he will bring a similar bill in the 2025 Legislature.",
      "Legislative debate over Montana\u2019s bill drew national attention in the spring of 2023 after Republicans punished Democratic Rep. Zooey Zephyr \u2014 the first transgender woman elected to the state\u2019s Legislature \u2014 for admonishing lawmakers who supported the bill.",
      "The Montana Supreme Court \u201chas reaffirmed what we have known all along \u2014 gender-affirming care saves lives, and like all health care decisions, it should be left between doctors and patients,\u201d Zephyr said Wednesday.",
      "Marks blocked the law in late September 2023, just days before it was to take effect. He agreed with transgender youth, their families and health care providers that the law is likely unconstitutional and would harm the mental and physical health of minors with gender dysphoria, rather than protect them from experimental treatments, as supporters said it would.",
      "Marks said he could only conclude the Legislature's stated intent in passing the law was \u201cdisingenuous\u201d and it seemed more likely its purpose is to \u201cban an outcome deemed undesirable by the Montana Legislature, veiled as protection for minors.\"",
      "The law sought to prohibit the use of puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and surgical treatments for gender dysphoria. However, cisgender minors would still be able to receive puberty blockers to treat early puberty or surgical procedures to treat intersex conditions, the plaintiffs argued.",
      "Montana is one of at least 26 states that have passed bans on gender-affirming medical care for minors and most face lawsuits. Some bans have been temporarily blocked by courts, while others have been allowed to take effect. Fifteen states have enacted protections for gender-affirming medical care for minors.",
      "In Montana\u2019s case, transgender youth argued the law would ban them from continuing to receive gender-affirming medical care, violating their constitutional rights to equal protection, the right to seek health care and the right to dignity. The state Supreme Court upheld the injunction based on the right to privacy, which court rulings have said includes the right to make personal medical decisions free from government interference.",
      "Two justices argued the court should have also clarified that discrimination on the basis of gender identity is a form of sex discrimination that is prohibited by the equal protection clause of the state constitution.",
      "The parents of the plaintiffs argued the law would violate their constitutional right to make medical decisions for their children and two medical providers said it would prevent them from providing effective and necessary care to their patients.",
      "Treatments for gender dysphoria meet standards of care approved by major medical organizations including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, the ACLU argued in its complaint.",
      "One of the young plaintiffs was dismissed from the lawsuit in September 2024 after turning 18.",

      "The British government has indefinitely banned puberty blockers for children with gender dysphoria after independent experts found there was an unacceptable safety risk in prescribing the medication",
      "LONDON -- The British government on Wednesday indefinitely banned puberty blockers for children with gender dysphoria after independent experts found there was an unacceptable safety risk in prescribing the medication.",
      "The decision, which will be revisited in 2027, effectively bans a common approach to medical gender transitions for youths. It also goes against standards held by medical groups elsewhere, including the European and World Professional Associations for Transgender Health, as well as the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "The ban will prevent prescribing medications that can suppress or pause puberty in children with gender dysphoria, providing more time to consider options that could include gender reassignment.",
      "The announcement comes after a judge this summer upheld an emergency ban in a ruling that said the treatment was potentially harmful. The emergency ban was put in place by the center-right Conservative government and has now been extended by the center-left Labour government.",
      "The ban does not apply to those already receiving puberty blockers for gender dysphoria, to their use in clinical studies or in treatment of children with precocious puberty, an uncommon medical condition that causes puberty to begin abnormally early.",
      "It applies across the United Kingdom after consultation with the Scottish and Welsh governments, and an agreement with Northern Ireland.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting said a clinical trial will be set up next year to better evaluate use of the drugs.",
      "\u201cWe need to act with caution and care when it comes to this vulnerable group of young people, and follow the expert advice,\u201d Streeting said.",
      "The National Health Service in England stopped prescribing puberty blockers at gender identity clinics last year, saying there was not enough evidence about the benefits and harms.",
      "In July, Justice Beverley Lang said a review commissioned by the NHS found \u201cvery substantial risks and very narrow benefits\u201d to the treatment. She concluded that gender care is an area of \u201cremarkably weak evidence\u201d and young people have been caught up in a \u201cstormy social discourse.\u201d",

      "The court challenge was brought by the group TransActual and a youth who cannot be named, according to a court order.",
      "TransActual criticized Wednesday's decision, saying that evidence of danger from 40 years of puberty blockers remains elusive.",
      "\u201cBanning medicines with no evidence of serious harm, only for trans people \u2026 is discrimination plain and simple,\u201d said Keyne Walker, the group\u2019s strategy director. \u201cEvidence of the harm of the temporary ban continues to emerge, and will grow now that it has been made permanent.\u201d"

      "Authorities say the mystery flu-like illness that has killed dozens of people in southwest Congo in recent weeks might be malaria",
      "KINSHASA, Congo -- The mystery flu-like illness that has killed dozens of people in southwest Congo in recent weeks might be malaria, according to results from laboratory samples of infected people, authorities said Wednesday.",
      "\u201cOf the 12 samples taken, nine were positive for malaria but these samples were not of very good quality, so we are continuing to research to find out if this is an epidemic,\" Dr. Jean-Jacques Muyembe, director-general of the National Institute for Biomedical Research in Kinshasa, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"But it is very likely that it is malaria because most of the victims are children,\u201d he added.",
      "On Tuesday, the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also said most of the samples tested positive for malaria, but noted it is possible that more than one disease was involved. He said further samples will be collected and tested.",
      "In recent weeks, there were 416 reported cases of the mystery disease and 31 deaths from it in hospitals, WHO director-general said. There were another 44 deaths in the community, Congo's health minister Roger Kamba said last week.",
      "Most of the cases and deaths are in children under 14 in the remote Panzi health zone in Congo's western Kwango province, according to the WHO.",
      "Panzi resident Ezekiel Kasongo said his 9-year-old son was just released from the hospital after he fell sick two weeks ago.",
      "\u201cHe had a high fever, a headache and was very weak,\u201d Kasongo told the AP. \u201cWe were very worried because of the number of deaths, especially among children, but God be praised, he is out.\u201d",
      "The symptoms include fever, headache, cough and anemia. Experts from the National Rapid Response Team and WHO were in Panzi last week to take samples and investigate.",
      "The Panzi health zone, around 435 miles (700 kilometers) from the capital, Kinshasa, is hard to access. The experts took two days to arrive, according to Congo's health minister.",
      "Because of the lack of local testing capacity, samples had to be taken to Kikwit, more than 500 kilometers away, the head of the National Institute for Public Health, Dieudonne Mwamba, said last week.",
      "Panzi was hit by an epidemic of typhoid fever two years ago, and there is currently a resurgence of seasonal flu across the country, Mwamba added.",
      "The area also has high levels of malnutrition and low vaccination coverage, leaving children vulnerable to a range of diseases including malaria, the head of the WHO said Tuesday."

She doesn\u2019t see this case as a good fit for the word, she says, because the victim wasn\u2019t linked to any specific crime or offense.

      "There were the posts lionizing Mangione\u2019s physique and appearance, the ones speculating about who could play him on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d and the ones denouncing and even threatening people at a Pennsylvania McDonald\u2019s for spotting him and calling police.",

      "In addition to a three-page, handwritten document that suggests he harbored \u201cill will toward corporate America,\u201d NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny has said Mangione also had a ghost gun, a type of weapon that can be assembled at home and is difficult to trace.",
      "Officers questioned Mangione, who was acting suspiciously and carrying multiple fraudulent IDs, as well as a U.S. passport, New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. Officers also found a sound suppressor, or silencer, \u201cconsistent with the weapon used in the murder,\u201d she said.",
      "He had clothing and a mask similar to those worn by the shooter and a fraudulent New Jersey ID matching one the suspect used to check into a New York City hostel before the shooting, the commissioner said.",
      "Mangione had severe back pain from childhood that interfered with many aspects of his life, according to Josiah Ryan, a spokesperson for a \u201cco-living\u201d space in Honolulu where the suspect lived in 2022.",
      "Mangione left Surfbreak to get surgery on the mainland, Ryan said, then later returned to Honolulu and rented an apartment.

Martin, said he was widely considered a \u201cgreat guy,\u201d though he had long dealt with severe back pain that interfered with many aspects of his life.",
      "Wearing an orange jumpsuit, Mangione mostly stared straight ahead during Tuesday's hearing in Pennsylvania, occasionally consulting papers, rocking in his chair, or looking back at the gallery. At one point, he began to speak to respond to the court discussion but was quieted by his lawyer.",
      "Judge David Consiglio denied bail to Mangione, whose attorney, Thomas Dickey, told the court his client did not agree to extradition and wants a hearing on the matter.",
      "Blair County District Attorney Peter Weeks said that although Mangione will create \u201cextra hoops\u201d for law enforcement to jump through by fighting extradition, it won\u2019t be a substantial barrier to sending him to New York."

      "Luigi Mangione \u2019s fingerprints also matched a water bottle and a snack bar wrapper that police found near the scene in midtown Manhattan, Commissioner Jessica Tisch said at an unrelated news conference. Police had said earlier that they believed the gunman bought the items at a nearby coffee shop while awaiting his target.",
      "Mangione, 26, remained jailed without bail Wednesday in Pennsylvania, where he was arrested and initially charged with gun and forgery offenses. Manhattan prosecutors were working to bring him to New York to face a murder charge in the death of Brian Thompson, the leader of the United States\u2019 biggest health insurer.",
      "Mangione's lawyer has cautioned the public against prejudging the case.",
      "While the case is in early stages, police believe the suspect may have been motivated by animus toward the health care industry.",
      "Investigators are looking into an accident that injured Mangione\u2019s back and sent him to an emergency room on July 4, 2023, police said Wednesday. They\u2019re scrutinizing his Facebook page, where he posted X-rays of numerous screws that were inserted into his spine. And police are studying his writings about the injury and his disdain for corporate America and the U.S. health care system.",
      "Authorities recovered a spiral notebook that Mangione kept, along with a three-page, handwritten letter found when he was arrested Monday in Pennsylvania, a law enforcement official said Wednesday. Police have not disclosed what was in the notebook.",

The official wasn\u2019t authorized to disclose information about the investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.",
      "A law enforcement bulletin obtained by the AP earlier this week said the letter disdained corporate greed and what Mangione called \u201cparasitic\u201d health insurance companies. The prep school and Ivy League graduate wrote that the U.S. has the most expensive health care system in the world and that major corporations' profits continue to rise while life expectancy doesn't, according to the bulletin.",
      "In his first public words since his arrest, Mangione shouted about an \u201cinsult to the intelligence of the American people\u201d on his way into court Tuesday.",
      "At a brief hearing, defense lawyer Thomas Dickey said that he didn't believe there was evidence to support a forgery charge and questioned whether the gun allegation amounts to a crime. Dickey also said Mangione would contest his extradition to New York and wanted a hearing on the issue.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t rush to judgment in this case or any case,\u201d Dickey said afterward. \u201cHe\u2019s presumed innocent. Let\u2019s not forget that.\u201d",
      "Mangione was arrested in Altoona, about 230 miles (about 370 kilometers) west of New York City, after a McDonald\u2019s customer recognized him and notified an employee, authorities said.",

      "Thompson, 50, was killed Dec. 4 as he walked alone to a Manhattan hotel for an investor conference.",
      "There were no fingerprints on the ammunition found at the shooting scene, but work is ongoing to analyze a print on cellphone left nearby, police said Wednesday.",
      "Police are continuing to search for more surveillance video showing Mangione's movements in New York between Nov. 24, when they say he arrived in the city, and the shooting. From video collected already, investigators determined the suspect quickly fled the city, likely by bus, after the killing.",
      "His movements afterward are unclear, but authorities believe he took steps to stay off the radar. Prosecutors said at Mangione's Pennsylvania hearing this week that when arrested, he had what are known as Faraday bags for his cellphone and laptop to block signals authorities can use to track electronic devices.",
      "Mangione, a grandson of a well-known Maryland real estate developer and philanthropist, had a graduate degree in computer science and worked for a time at a car-buying website. During the first half of 2022, he bunked at a co-living space in Hawaii, where those who knew him said he suffered from severe and sometimes debilitating back pain.",

      "The Ohio Supreme Court has ruled that Ohio's product liability law prohibits counties from bringing public-nuisance claims against national pharmaceutical chains as they did as part of national opioid litigation",
      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- The Ohio Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that the state's product liability law prohibits counties from bringing public nuisance claims against national pharmaceutical chains as they did as part of national opioid litigation, a decision that could overturn a $650 million judgment against the pharmacies.",
      "An attorney for the counties called the decision \u201cdevastating.\u201d",
      "Justices were largely unanimous in their interpretation of an arcane disagreement over the state law, which had emerged in a lawsuit brought by Lake and Trumbull counties outside Cleveland against CVS, Walgreens and Walmart.",
      "The counties won their initial lawsuit \u2014 and were awarded $650 million in damages by a federal judge in 2022 \u2014 but the pharmacies had disputed the court's reading of the Ohio Product Liability Act, which they said protected them from such sanctions.",
      "In an opinion written by Justice Joseph Deters, the court found that Ohio state lawmakers intended the law to prevent \u201call common law product liability causes of action\" \u2014 even if they don't seek compensatory damages but merely \u201cequitable relief\u201d for the communities.",
      "\u201cThe plain language of the OPLA abrogates product-liability claims, including product-related public-nuisance claims seeking equitable relief,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are constrained to interpret the statute as written, not according to our own personal policy preferences.\u201d",
      "Two of the Republican-dominated court's Democratic justices disagreed on that one point, while concurring on the rest of the judgment.",
      "\u201cAny award to abate a public nuisance like the opioid epidemic would certainly be substantial in size and scope, given that the claimed nuisance is both long-lasting and widespread,\u201d Justice Melody Stewart wrote in an opinion joined by Justice Michael Donnelly. \u201cBut just because an abatement award is of substantial size and scope does not mean it transforms it into a compensatory-damages award.\u201d",
      "In a statement, the plaintiffs' co-liaison counsel in the national opioid litigation, Peter Weinberger, of the Cleveland-based law firm Spangenberg Shibley & Liber, lamented the decision.",
      "\u201cThis ruling will have a devastating impact on communities and their ability to police corporate misconduct,\" he said. \u201cWe have used public nuisance claims across the country to obtain nearly $60 billion in opioid settlements, including nearly $1 billion in Ohio alone, and the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s ruling undermines the very legal basis that drove this result.\u201d",
      "But Weinberger said Tuesday's ruling would not be the end, and that communities would continue to fight \u201cthrough other legal avenues.\u201d",
      "\"We remain steadfast in our commitment to holding all responsible parties to account as this litigation continues nationwide,\u201d he said.",
      "In his 2022 ruling, U.S. District Judge Dan Polster said that the money awarded to Lake and Trumbull counties would be used to fight the opioid crisis. Attorneys at the time put the total price tag at $3.3 billion for the damage done.",
      "Lake County was to receive $306 million over 15 years. Trumbull County was to receive $344 million over the same period. Nearly $87 million was to be paid immediately to cover the first two years of payments.",
      "A jury returned a verdict in favor of the counties in November 2021, after a six-week trial. It was then left to the judge to decide how much the counties should receive. He heard testimony the next May to determine damages.",
      "The counties convinced the jury that the pharmacies played an outsized role in creating a public nuisance in the way they dispensed pain medication. It was the first time pharmacy companies completed a trial to defend themselves in a drug crisis that has killed a half-million Americans since 1999.",

      "Judge Daniel Traynor of the U.S. District Court in North Dakota issued the order Monday from Bismarck, dealing a setback to a Biden administration rule that was estimated to allow 147,000 immigrants to enroll for coverage. Traynor's ruling came in a lawsuit filed over the policy and will remain in effect until the matter can go to trial.",
      "The ruling applies to immigrants in 19 states where Republican attorneys general sued to avoid having to comply with the new policy. They cited concern over immigrants possibly qualifying for public subsidies available to many people insured under the ACA.",
      "The GOP state officials argued that the rule created earlier this year by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services would be a strong incentive for immigrants to remain in the U.S. illegally and could creating costs for states. They argued that both the Affordable Care Act and a 1996 law prohibit U.S. government benefits flowing to immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.",
      "\u201cDreamers\u201d are part of a program that makes them a low priority for deportation. However, President-elect Donald Trump won the Nov. 5 election promising \u201cthe largest mass deportation program in history.\u201d He will succeed President Joe Biden on Jan. 20.",
      "Traynor, a Trump appointee during his first term in office, concluded through what he called \u201ca common-sense inference\u201d that access to subsidized ACA coverage is a powerful incentive for people to remain in the U.S. illegally, creating a substantial risk that states will \u201csuffer monetary harm.\u201d",
      "Federal law gives CMS the authority to determine whether someone is living in the U.S. legally, but, Traynor wrote, \u201cIt by no means allows the agency to circumvent congressional authority and redefine the term \u2018lawfully present.\u2019\u201d",
      "CMS said in a statement Tuesday that it is reviewing the lawsuit but does not comment on litigation.",
      "Nicholas Esp\u00edritu, deputy legal director of the National Immigration Law Center, said some \u201cDreamers\u201d have been waiting for more than a decade to get \u201clife-sustaining\u201d health coverage through the ACA.",
      "\u201cJudge Traynor\u2019s ruling is both disappointing and wrong on the law,\u201d Esp\u00edritu said, promising his group would continue to fight the issue.",

    "summary": "Americans should eat more beans, peas and lentils and cut back on red and processed meats and starchy vegetables",

      "Americans should eat more beans, peas and lentils and cut back on red and processed meats and starchy vegetables",
      "Americans should eat more beans, peas and lentils and cut back on red and processed meats and starchy vegetables, all while continuing to limit added sugars, sodium and saturated fat.",
      "That's the advice released Tuesday by a panel of nutrition experts charged with counseling the U.S. government about the 2025 edition of the dietary guidelines that will form the cornerstone of federal food programs and policy.",
      "But the 20-member panel didn't weigh in on the growing role of ultraprocessed foods that have been linked to health problems, saying there's not enough evidence to tell people to avoid them. And the group steered clear of updating controversial guidance on alcohol consumption, leaving that analysis to two outside reports expected to be released soon.",
      "Overall, the recommendations for the 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines for Americans sound familiar, said Marion Nestle, a food policy expert.",
      "\u201cThis looks like every other set of dietary guidelines since 1980: eat your veggies and reduce consumption of foods high in salt, sugar and saturated fat,\u201d Nestle said in an email. \u201cThis particular statement says nothing about balancing calories, when overconsumption of calories, especially from ultra-processed foods, is the biggest challenge to the health of Americans.\u201d",
      "The nutrition panel concluded that a healthy diet for people aged 2 years and older is higher in vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, whole grains, fish and and vegetable oils that are higher in unsaturated fat.",
      "It is lower in red and processed meats, sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, refined grains and saturated fat. It may also include fat-free or low-fat dairy and foods lower in sodium and may include plant-based foods.",
      "The panel, which met for nearly two years, was the first to focus on the dietary needs of Americans through what they called a \u201chealth equity lens,\u201d said Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, a Massachusetts General Hospital obesity expert who was part of the group. That meant considering factors such as household income, race, ethnicity and culture when recommending healthy diets. It will help ensure that the guidance \u201creflects and includes various population groups,\u201d she said in an email.",
      "Ultraprocessed foods include the snacks, sugary cereals and frozen meals that make up about 60% of the American diet.",
      "The panel considered more than 40 studies, including several that showed links between ultraprocessed foods and becoming overweight or developing obesity. But the nutrition experts had concerns with the quality of the research, leaving them to conclude that the evidence was too limited to make recommendations.",
      "That decision is likely to bump up against the views of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the nominee to lead the U.S. Health and Human Services Department, who has questioned potential conflicts of interest among members of the dietary guidelines panel and vowed to crack down on ultraprocessed foods that contribute to chronic disease.",
      "The panel also didn't revise recommendations that suggest limiting alcohol intake to two drinks or less a day for men and one drink or less a day for women.",
      "In 2020, the last time the guidance was updated, the government rejected the advice of scientific advisers to recommend less alcohol consumption.",
      "Two groups \u2014 the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine and a committee of the government agency that oversees substance abuse \u2014 are expected to release reports in the coming months on the effects of moderate alcohol use to inform the guidelines.",
      "The advisory panel acknowledged that the diets of most Americans don't meet the current guidelines. More than half of all U.S. adults have one or more diet-related chronic health conditions and 18 million U.S. households have insecure sources of food, according to the report.",
      "\u201cNutrition-related chronic health conditions and their precursors continue to threaten health through the lifespan,\" the report concludes. \u201cWhich does not bode well for the future of health in the United States.\u201d",
      "The scientific report informs the dietary guidelines, which are updated every five years. Tuesday\u2019s recommendations now go to HHS and the Agriculture Department, where officials will draft the final guidance set for release next year.",
      "Starting Wednesday, the public will have 60 days to comment on the guidance. HHS and USDA officials will hold a public meeting Jan. 16 to discuss the recommendations.",
      "The new guidance, which will be finalized by the incoming Trump administration, is consistent with decades of federal efforts to reduce diet-related disease in the U.S., said Dr. Peter Lurie, president of the advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest.",
      "\u201cBroadly, I think these are well-formulated recommendations that the incoming administration would do well to adopt,\u201d Lurie said.",

      "Cases of dengue have been surging globally as warmer weather brought on by climate change enables mosquitoes to expand their reach.",
      "The Pan American Health Organization \u2014the regional office of the World Health Organization in the Americas \u2014 said deaths from dengue are also rising.",
      "More than 7,700 deaths have been reported in the Caribbean and the Americas so far in 2024, a more than 200% increase, compared to 2,467 deaths in 2023, according to the organization.",
      "The number of cases in the region, which includes the United States, is the highest reported since record keeping began in 1980, PAHO director Jarbas Barbosa said at a news conference.",
      "\u201cThis is linked directly to climatic events,\u201d he said, referencing warmer temperatures, droughts and flooding. A fast population growth, unplanned urbanization and poor sanitation have contributed to the rise in dengue.",
      "The virus has surged worldwide since last year and spread to areas previously free of dengue, according to PAHO.",
      "Brazil is reporting the highest number of dengue cases with more than 10 million, followed by Argentina, with more than 580,000, and Mexico with more than half a million.",
      "In the Caribbean, Guyana is leading with more than 41,000 cases, followed by French Guiana, the Dominican Republic and Martinique.",
      "Meanwhile, local dengue transmission has been reported in California, Florida and Texas this year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "There are four types of dengue virus, simply known as 1, 2, 3 and 4. Having one type of virus doesn't provide immunity from others.",
      "For the first time in a decade, dengue serotype 3 has predominated in Mexico, Central America and parts of the Caribbean in the second half of the year, according to Thais dos Santos, PAHO\u2019s advisor on arboviral diseases.",
      "Many infected people don\u2019t get sick, but some experience headache, fever and flu-like symptoms. Severe cases can cause serious bleeding, shock and death. Repeated infections can be especially dangerous.",
      "Dengue cases usually surge during the wet season, but by late March, Puerto Rico already had declared an epidemic, with officials warning last month that it cannot be controlled unless residents cooperate. The U.S. territory has reported more than 4,900 cases and at least nine deaths so far this year. Victims include a 17-year-old girl and a 31-year-old woman.",
      "The cases in Puerto Rico nearly quadrupled from last year, according to government data.",
      "Lydia Plat\u00f3n, a 55-year-old English professor at the University of Puerto Rico, got dengue in October. \u201cYou have fever all the time. You have horrible chills,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that my energy has returned yet.\u201d",
      "Her neighborhood reported five cases in six weeks, which she blames on heavy rains at the time and stagnant and accumulated water. One of the cases was her 17-year-old daughter. Plat\u00f3n said she now lights incense and sprays herself with repellant every afternoon.",
      "Puerto Rico officials are urging people to get rid of stagnant water where mosquitoes lay eggs. The government in Trinidad and Tobago has started issuing fines to people whose properties have become breeding sites for mosquitoes.",
      "This year, more than one-third of cases in Costa Rica, Mexico and Paraguay have been reported in children younger than 15, with Guatemala reporting a high number of child deaths, Barbosa said.",
      "Vaccines against dengue have been introduced in Peru, Brazil and Argentina, with Honduras slated to receive them next year, but they\u2019re meant mostly for children and are most effective in those already infected with dengue once, dos Santos said.",
      "She noted that supplies are limited and that vaccines are not expected to have a big impact on transmission. She stressed that preventive measures remain crucial.",

      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- The federal government has sued South Carolina, saying the state has not done enough to make sure people with serious mental illnesses are taken out of group homes and helped to get back into the community where they can work and lead independent lives.",
      "The lawsuit filed Monday said the state violates the Americans with Disabilities Act by opting, through money and policy decisions, to leave people with mental illnesses in group homes where they can't choose what to eat, pick their own roommate, find a way to work at a job or go to church and other activities.",
      "The state has known about the issues since a different 2016 lawsuit and federal officials warned them of the problems and possible legal action in a 23-page report in May 2023, U.S. Justice Department lawyers said in court papers.",
      "\u201cPeople with disabilities in South Carolina can and must be able to receive services in their own homes, rather than being isolated in institutions,\u201d Kristen Clarke, an assistant attorney in the agency's Civil Rights Division, said in a statement.",
      "While Republican South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster questioned the timing of the lawsuit, coming in the final weeks of Democratic President Joe Biden's administration, he is working on solutions to the problems brought up in the suit, spokesman Brandon Charochak said in a statement.",
      "One idea is to combine the state Department of Mental Health and the Department of Disabilities and Special Needs and put the new agency in the governor's cabinet under his supervision.",
      "\u201cThe fact remains that our state\u2019s healthcare delivery system is fractured with non-cabinet agencies that are unaccountable and inefficient. The governor believes the time to change this is now,\u201d Charochak said.",
      "Federal officials suggested spending more money and making sure the state's Medicaid program makes adequate payments for programs called assertive community treatments.",
      "Under the prgrams, teams visit people with serious mental illnesses in their home. There is at least one psychiatrist, two psychiatric nurses, specialists in employment and substance abuse, and other professionals.",
      "Research has found the teams often can head off a mental health crisis. They also can provide crisis teams that can respond quickly to prevent bigger issues, from police involvement to psychiatric hospital stays, the Justice Department investigation found.",
      "There are only four teams in South Carolina \u2014 in Columbia, Greenville and Dillon \u2014 and they don't provide statewide coverage. They also have low staffing.",
      "Currently, about 1,000 people live in group homes. A large number of them told federal investigators they wanted to live on their own, but ran into problems.",
      "Federal officials spent months investigating what are officially called community residential care facilities, talking to residents, administrators and people who provide treatment outside the homes for those with mental illnesses who are living independently.",
      "The identities of those who spoke were kept anonymous for their privacy, including one group home resident who pointed out the living conditions weren\u2019t much different than decades ago when people with mental illness were housed in giant centers with no private rooms and little individualized care.",
      "Residents of the group home often only get to leave for a monthly outing to Walmart or Dollar General. They have no way of working because they can\u2019t get transportation to a job. Sometimes the home is fenced in with locked doors and security cameras.",
      "\u201cSomething like a little asylum in here,\u201d the resident told investigators.",
      "The homes are required by law to post calendars with activities. Investigators found almost all of them were events inside the home like arts and crafts, \u201cname that tune,\u201d Bible study, bingo, \u201cbubble-blowing fun\u201d and coloring pages, federal officials told the state.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no vision of ever getting out. There\u2019s no vision of having a real life. \u2026 There\u2019s no vision of anything. They just feel stuck. That\u2019s almost like hospitals used to be, 150 years ago,\u201d a state employee who regularly visits one home told investigators.",
      "The report cited the case of a 40-year-old man who lived independently for three years when a break-in at his apartment caused a mental health crisis that led to several months in a psychiatric hospital. He was released to a group home, where he has lived for 11 years. He told investigators he wants to live independently but has been offered no help.",
      "A 43-year-old woman told investigators she had a mental crisis in 2020 and went to a group home because her parents thought it would help her rebuild her independence. Now the parents are trying to get her out because she got no help for living skills.",
      "Others had a financial crisis that coincided with a mental crisis and need help with affordable housing or job skills."

    "story": [
      "Authorities in Mexico say a total of 17 children have died in central Mexico from suspected contamination of IV feeding bags, after four more deaths were confirmed",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Authorities in Mexico said Tuesday that a total of 17 children have died in central Mexico from suspected contamination of IV feeding bags after four more deaths were confirmed.",
      "David Kershenobich, the country\u2019s public health secretary, said 16 of the victims were underweight, premature babies being treated at hospitals; the other victim was 14 years old.",
      "He said that two bacteria, including a multidrug-resistant bug, were suspected in the deaths.",
      "Investigators say the bacterial contamination apparently happened at a plant in the city of Toluca that manufactured the IV nutrition mixture, and that the company had been temporarily shut down and use of the product had been halted.",
      "The first infections were reported starting Nov. 22 and the last was identified on Dec. 3. Around 20 other patients had been sickened by the infection and were being treated for it.",
      "All 13 of the first deaths occurred at three government hospitals and one private one in the State of Mexico, on the outskirts of Mexico City.",
      "Kershenobich said he did not expect any other deaths, but noted authorities had \u201cdetected other possible outbreaks with similar characteristics in Mexico State, which are under investigation.\u201d",
      "Three more deaths were found to have occurred in the neighboring state of Michoacan and one in the north-central state of Guanajuato. Authorities said the same bacteria, and the same IV bags, were implicated in all the deaths.",
      "Earlier, the federal Public Health Department ordered doctors across the country not to use IV nutrition bags made by the company Productos Hospitalarios S.A de C.V., though the exact source of the infections is still under investigation. Phone calls to numbers listed for the company and emails seeking comment went unanswered.",
      "The outbreak appeared to involve Klebsiella oxytoca, a multidrug-resistant bacteria, and enterobacter cloacae, which caused blood infections in the babies.",
      "It was the latest public blow to Mexico\u2019s tottering, underfunded healthcare system. Last month, the director of the country\u2019s flagship national cardiology institute said the hospital didn\u2019t have money to buy essential supplies, calling the situation \u201ccritical.\u201d",
      "Dr. Jorge Gaspar, the hospital\u2019s director, wrote an internal letter saying that budget cuts \u201chave affected the acquisition of supplies necessary for the institution\u2019s functioning.\u201d In a subsequent public letter the next day, he clarified that the initial message was intended for an \u201cinternal\u201d audience and assured the public that \u201cwe are working to solve the situation.\u201d",
      "Mexico has been plagued by contaminated medical supply scandals for years.",
      "In 2023, authorities arrested an anesthesiologist they blamed for an outbreak of meningitis that killed 35 patients and sickened 79.",
      "The doctor, whose name was withheld, apparently carried his own morphine from one private hospital to another, spreading a fungal infection that contaminated the medication at the first clinic, authorities said.",
      "The drug may not have been stored properly. Some smaller hospitals or maternity clinics in Mexico don\u2019t have their own dispensing pharmacies or are not authorized to handle controlled medications like opiates, and thus long relied on anesthesiologists to bring their own.",
      "In 2020, 14 people died after a hospital run by Mexico\u2019s state-owned oil company gave a drug to dialysis patients that was contaminated with bacteria. More than 69 patients were sickened in that outbreak.",
      "Former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who left office on Sept. 30, frequently complained that drug supply companies were charging too much, and so he essentially revamped the whole medical purchasing system, pledging to provide Mexicans healthcare that is \u201cbetter than in Denmark.\u201d",
      "However, the new system of government-run warehouses has foundered, plagued by chronic shortages of supplies and drugs, while a gargantuan government supply depot L\u00f3pez Obrador set up and called the \u201cmega drug store\u201d now sits largely empty.",

      "A U.S. health panel says women should have the option of taking their own test samples for cervical cancer screening",
      "Women should have the option of taking their own test samples for cervical cancer screening, an influential health panel said Tuesday.",
      "Draft recommendations from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force are aimed at getting more people screened and spreading the word that women can take their own vaginal samples to check for cancer-causing HPV.",
      "Women in their 20s should still get a Pap test every three years. But after that \u2014 from age 30 to 65 \u2014 women can get an HPV test every five years, the panel said.",
      "And those HPV tests can be done with samples collected either by a doctor or by the patient herself in a mobile clinic or medical office. Women ages 30 to 65 can still opt for a Pap test done by a doctor every three years, or a Pap plus an HPV test every five years.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very hopeful that self-collection will help even more women get screened and help us reduce even further the burden of cervical cancer among women,\u201d said task force vice chair Dr. John Wong of Tufts University School of Medicine.",
      "Earlier this year, U.S. regulators expanded the use of two HPV test kits to include self-collection. Studies show women and doctors take samples with similar accuracy.",
      "For now, the tests are only for use in health care settings; home testing may be on the horizon.",
      "HPV, or human papillomavirus, is very common and is spread through sex. Most HPV infections clear up on their own, but persistent infection can lead to cancer of the cervix. Most cervical cancers occur in women who are inadequately screened, diagnosed or treated.",
      "To collect a sample, a swab or brush from the kit is inserted into the vagina and rotated. It is put in a tube and processed at a lab.",
      "The HPV tests detect high-risk types of the virus. In contrast, a Pap test looks for abnormal cells in the cervix.",
      "Australia, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden already use self-collection for cervical cancer screening.",
      "Deaths from cervical cancers have declined in the U.S. in the past decade, and there is an HPV vaccine recommended for preteens that is preventing cancer in women and men. Still, nearly 14,000 new cases of cervical cancer were diagnosed in the U.S. this year and there were an estimated 4,360 deaths.",
      "Black women, Native American women and Hispanic women still have higher death rates compared to white women. Women living in isolated areas also have higher than average death rates.",
      "For many women, transgender men and nonbinary people, collecting their own sample could be more comfortable than the stirrups and speculum used by a doctor.",
      "The draft advice remains largely the same as the group's previous recommendations from 2018. For example, women younger than 21 don't need to be screened for cervical cancer. Neither do women older than 65 who've had regular screenings with normal results. And women of any age who've had a total hysterectomy don't need to be screened.",
      "The recommendations are open for comment through Jan. 13.",

      "Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s office said Tuesday it will seek a Governor\u2019s warrant to secure Mangione\u2019s extradition to Manhattan.",
      "Under state law, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul can issue a warrant of arrest demanding Mangione\u2019s return to the state. Such a warrant must recite the facts necessary to the validity of its issuance and be sealed with the state seal. It would then be presented to law enforcement in Pennsylvania to expedite Mangione\u2019s return to New York.",

      "Other social media companies such as Meta have removed his accounts. According to X rules, the platform removes \u201cany accounts maintained by individual perpetrators of terrorist, violent extremist, or mass violent attacks, as well as any accounts glorifying the perpetrator(s), or dedicated to sharing manifestos and/or third party links where related content is hosted.\u201d",

      "Mangione could have the Pennsylvania charges read aloud to him and may be asked to enter a plea.",
      "They include possession of an unlicensed firearm, forgery and providing false identification to police. In New York, he was charged late Monday with murder in the death of UnitedHealthcare\u2019s CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "Mangione likely was motivated by his anger with what he called \u201cparasitic\u201d health insurance companies and a disdain with corporate greed, said a a law enforcement bulletin obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "He wrote that the U.S. has the most expensive healthcare system in the world and that the profits of major corporations continue to rise while \u201cour life expectancy\u201d does not, according to the bulletin, based on a review of the suspect\u2019s hand-written notes and social media postings.",
      "He appeared to view the targeted killing of the UnitedHealthcare CEO as a symbolic takedown, asserting in his note that he is the \u201cfirst to face it with such brutal honesty,\u201d the bulletin said.",
      "Mangione called \u201cUnabomber\u201d Ted Kaczynski a \u201cpolitical revolutionary\u201d and may have found inspiration from the man who carried out a series of bombings while railing against modern society and technology, the document said.",

      "Mangione is now charged in Pennsylvania with being a fugitive of justice.",
      "A customer at the McDonald\u2019s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, where Mangione was arrested said one of his friends had commented beforehand that the man looked like the suspect wanted for the shooting in New York City.",
      "\u201cIt started out almost a little bit like a joke, my one friend thought he looked like the shooter,\u201d said the customer, who declined to give his full name, on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t really a joke, but we laughed about it,\u201d he added.",
      "The warrant on murder and other charges is a step that could help expedite his extradition from Pennsylvania.",
      "In court papers made public Tuesday, a New York City police detective reiterated key findings in the investigation he said tied Mangione to the killing, including surveillance footage and a fake ID he used to check into a Manhattan hostel on Nov. 24.",
      "Police officers in Altoona, Pennsylvania, found that ID when they arrested Mangione on Monday.",
      "Mangione is being held without bail in Pennsylvania on charges of possession of an unlicensed firearm, forgery and providing false identification to police. Late Monday, Manhattan prosecutors charged him with five counts, including murder, criminal possession of a weapon and criminal possession of a forged instrument.",
      "Mangione doesn\u2019t yet have a lawyer who can speak on his behalf, court officials said.",
      "Images of Mangione released Tuesday by Pennsylvania State Police showed him pulling down his mask in the corner of the McDonald\u2019s while holding what appeared to be hash browns and wearing a winter jacket and ski cap. In another photo from a holding cell, he stood unsmiling with rumpled hair.",
      "Mangione\u2019s cousin, Maryland lawmaker Nino Mangione, announced Tuesday morning that he\u2019s postponing a fundraiser planned later this week at the Hayfields Country Club north of Baltimore, which was purchased by the Mangione family in 1986.",
      "\u201cBecause of the nature of this terrible situation involving my Cousin I do not believe it is appropriate to hold my fundraising event scheduled for this Thursday at Hayfields,\u201d Nino Mangione said in a social media post. \u201cI want to thank you for your thoughts, prayers, and support. My family and I are heartbroken and ask that you remember the family of Mr. Thompson in your prayers. Thank you.\u201d",
      "Officers used New York City\u2019s muscular surveillance system. Investigators analyzed DNA samples, fingerprints and internet addresses. Police went door to door looking for witnesses.",
      "When an arrest came five days later, those sprawling investigative efforts shared credit with an alert civilian\u2019s instincts. A customer at a McDonald\u2019s restaurant in Pennsylvania noticed another patron who resembled the man in the oblique security-camera photos New York police had publicized.",
      "He remains jailed in Pennsylvania, where he was initially charged with possession of an unlicensed firearm, forgery and providing false identification to police. By late Monday evening, prosecutors in Manhattan had added a charge of murder, according to an online court docket.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether Luigi Nicholas Mangione has an attorney who can comment on the allegations. Asked at Monday\u2019s arraignment whether he needed a public defender, Mangione asked whether he could \u201canswer that at a future date.\u201d"

      "\u201cWe should not think the sky will fall if people do not follow us,\u201d the minister said. The government was unresponsive to people because it didn't have answers to their questions, creating a challenge within the Taliban's Islamic system, he said.",

      "The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons on Monday told Syria that it is under obligations to comply with rules to safeguard and destroy dangerous substances, such as chlorine gas, after rebels entered the capital, Damascus, over the weekend.",
      "\u201cChemical weapons have been used in Syria on multiple occasions and victims deserve that perpetrators that we identified be brought to justice and held accountable for what they did and that investigations continue,\u201d Fernando Arias Gonz\u00e1lez, the OPCW secretary general, said in his opening remarks.",

      "U.N. experts say there has been a slight drop in the production of opium in Myanmar, the world\u2019s biggest source of the illicit drug from which heroin is derived, but warn there are still strong prospects for future expansion of the deadly trade",
      "BANGKOK -- There has been a slight drop in the production of opium in Myanmar, the world\u2019s biggest source of the illicit drug from which heroin is derived, experts from the United Nations said Thursday, while warning of strong prospects for future expansion of the deadly trade.",
      "The Myanmar Opium Survey 2024 issued by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime says that after three consecutive years of growth, the area where opium is cultivated fell by 4% to 45,200 hectares (111,700 acres) and production decreased by 8% to 995 metric tons due to a 4% decline in opium yield.",
      "UNODC announced last year that Myanmar had overtaken Afghanistan to become the world\u2019s top opium producer, saying a ban imposed by the ruling Taliban after its 2021 takeover led to a 95% drop there in opium cultivation. Opium, the base from which morphine and heroin are produced, is harvested from poppy flowers.",
      "Meanwhile, Myanmar registered growth in cultivation and production from 2021 through 2023, which UNODC attributed largely to",
      "fostered by the crisis that arose after its army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021. Resistance to the takeover has led to what is now a civil war.",
      "Many farmers who had left opium behind during the period of relative stability before the military takeover returned to growing opium, Masood Karimipour, UNODC Regional Representative for Southeast Asia and the Pacific, said at a press briefing about the survey, which utilized both on-the-ground investigations and satellite surveillance.",
      "The consequences of the supply shakeup remain unclear, UNODC experts said.",
      "\u201cWe believe that at the moment the global supply chain for heroin has not been fully adjusted,\u201d said Inshik Sim, a UNODC Research Officer, \u201cAnd there is an implication that because there is a lack of heroin at the global level, somebody has to fill the markets and that may push the Myanmar opium poppy farmers to increasingly engage in opium poppy cultivation.\u201d",
      "In 2024, however, UNODC says the fighting at the heart of the instability intensified so much that it may have constrained production, due to factors including displacement and restrictions on movement, as appears to be the case in the opium-producing regions of Shan and Kachin in eastern and northern Myanmar.",
      "That does not necessarily mean production has plateaued, said the U.N. experts.",
      "\u201cTroublingly, we are seeing indicators that the expanding and intensifying conflict in Myanmar is also a growing concern,\u201d said Karimipour. \u201dSo as the situation in Myanmar remains volatile and as the governance and humanitarian crises there continue, we may again see more people pushed into opium cultivation.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd we also note that the farmers have reported to us that their number one reason is just to put food on the table and that economic need will continue to intensify and worsen. So we don\u2019t predict an alleviation in the motivation to continue to grow opium.\u201d",
      "\"It\u2019s very important for the international community to do what it can to support farming communities, to build resilience outside the opium economy, as the push factors that we\u2019ve just discussed will continue,\" Karimipour said, adding that, \u201cand it\u2019s important to continue monitoring the situation in both Myanmar and Afghanistan as it relates to the global heroin supply chains.\u201d",
      "Northeastern Myanmar is part of the infamous \u201cGolden Triangle,\u201d where the borders of Myanmar, Laos and Thailand meet. The production of opium and heroin historically flourished there, largely because of the lawlessness in border areas where Myanmar\u2019s central government has been able to exercise only minimum control over various ethnic minority militias, some of them partners in the drug trade.",
      "In recent decades, after the region\u2019s opium production had dropped, methamphetamine in the form of tablets and crystal meth supplanted it. It\u2019s easier to make on an industrial scale than the labor-intensive cultivation of opium, and gets distributed by land, sea and air around Asia and the Pacific."

      "TOKYO -- Meat from fin whales caught for the first time in nearly 50 years off Japan\u2019s northern coast fetched up to more than $1,300 per kilogram (2.2 lbs) at auction Thursday, as officials try to keep the struggling industry alive.",
      "Japan\u2019s Fisheries Agency this year added fin whales to its list of three whale species that can be legally hunted as the country expands commercial whaling along its coast.",
      "Japan resumed commercial whaling within its exclusive economic zone after withdrawing from the International Whaling Commission in 2019. The IWC designated the fin whale as a species for protection from overhunting in 1976.",
      "Japan said its recent stock surveys confirmed a sufficient recovery of fin whale populations in the North Pacific. Officials said 30 of the whales \u2014 half of the quota of 60 \u2014 were caught this season. Japan set a combined catch quota of 379 for the three other whale species \u2014 minke, Bryde's and sei whales.",
      "The country's only large-scale whaling fleet operator Kyodo Senpaku Co. launched the 7.5 billion-yen ($49-million) Kangei Maru \u2014 a 9,300-ton new ship \u2014 this year in a show of determination to stay in the industry.",
      "On Thursday, some 1.4 tons of fresh meat from several fin whales caught off Japan\u2019s northern main island of Hokkaido was auctioned at the Sapporo fish market and the Kangei Maru\u2019s home port of Shimonoseki.",
      "In Shimonoseki, where 250 kilograms (550 lbs) of fin whale meat was flown from Hokkaido for the event, the tail meat \u2014 a delicacy known as \u201conomi\u201d \u2014 fetched the day\u2019s highest price at 200,000 yen ($1,312) per kilogram (2.2 lbs), according to the city\u2019s fishery promotion department.",
      "\u201cWe hear the larger the whale, the better the taste, so I assume fin whales are more delicious than other kinds of whales, though I never had a chance to taste it and cannot compare,\u201d city official Ryo Minezoe said.",
      "Japan\u2019s whaling has long been a source of controversy and criticism from conservationists.",
      "But anti-whaling protests have largely subsided after Japan switched from much-criticized Antarctic \u201cresearch whaling\u201d \u2014 seen as a cover for commercial hunts \u2014 to commercial whaling off the country's waters.",
      "Last year, Japanese whalers caught 294 minke, Bryde\u2019s and sei whales \u2014 less than 80% of the quota and fewer than the number once hunted in the Antarctic and the northwestern Pacific under the research program.",
      "Whaling officials link the declining catch to climate change, but critics say overhunting may be the cause.",
      "Nanami Kurasawa, who heads a conservationist group Dolphin & Whale Action Network, opposes resuming hunts of fin whales, saying they had gone nearly extinct after overhunt decades ago and their details around the Japanese coasts are not fully researched. Whalers want to go after larger whales because of efficiency, but they should more thoroughly investigate whale stock, she says.",
      "Whale meat in Japan was an affordable source of protein for the country's malnourished population in the years following World War II, with annual consumption peaking at 233,000 tons in 1962. Other meats have largedly replaced whale and supply has since fallen to around 2,000 tons in recent years, Fisheries Agency statistics show.",
      "Japanese officials want to increase that to about 5,000 tons, to keep the industry afloat.",
      "Experts say they doubt there is much demand in Japan where whale meat is no longer a familiar, affordable food. The biggest question is if the industry can survive without government subsidies of hundreds of millions of yen (millions of dollars).",
      "Nobuhiro Kishigami, a professor and expert on indigenous whaling at National Museum of Ethnology in Osaka, said whale meat is eaten in some whaling towns but rarely in Tokyo or elsewhere in Japan. Whale meat is more expensive than beef or other meat.",
      "\u201cIt is not a kind of food you have daily, but a delicacy ... If it is not accessible and delicious, well, let\u2019s leave the taste aside, it won\u2019t sell if it is not cheap and good,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is supposed to be business, and without large government subsidies, I think it would be extremely difficult for it to be sustainable.\u201d"

      "A Serbian court has convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison a man who gunned down nine people and wounded 12 in a shooting last year that was one of two mass killings which shook the Balkan nation",
      "BELGRADE, Serbia -- A Serbian court on Thursday convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison a young man who gunned down nine people and wounded 12 in one of two back-to-back mass killings last year which shook the Balkan nation.",
      "Uros Blazic, 21, took up an automatic rifle on May 4, 2023 and opened fire at multiple locations in two villages outside Belgrade, randomly shooting at young people hanging out on a spring evening.",
      "Blazic was \u201caware of his actions and their illegality, and with relentless violent behavior\" killed and wounded people, judges said.",
      "The carnage came just a day after a teenager using his father\u2019s gun shot and killed nine fellow students and a guard at an elementary school in central Belgrade in what was Serbia\u2019s first ever school shooting.",
      "The parents of the school shooting suspect have gone on trial in Belgrade. The suspect himself was below the age of criminal responsibility and remains in a specialized mental institution.",
      "The killings stunned the country which was used to wars and crisis but where mass shootings were relatively rare. The tragedies later triggered a wave of street protests and a crackdown on widespread illegal gun ownership.",
      "Blazic was arrested in central Serbia hours after the shootings in the villages of Dubona and Malo Orasje, just south of Belgrade. The 20-year prison sentence is the maximum permitted under Serbian law for people under 21 years of age. Blazic was 20 when he committed the crime.",
      "Separately, the gunman's father, Radisa Blazic was also convicted for illegal possession of guns used in the shooting, and sentenced to 20 years in prison.",
      "During his trial, the younger Blazic said he could not explain what prompted him to kill so many people. He said during closing arguments that he had felt victimized but that there could be no justification for what he had done.",
      "\u201cI committed hideous acts and I deserve the toughest punishment,\u201d he told the court.",
      "Serbian media have reported that Blazic, who had a police record, was known for violent outbursts and aggressive behavior prior to the shootings.",
      "Parents and relatives of the victims were present in the courtroom in Belgrade as the verdict was read out. Many of them sobbed as they entered the court on Thursday morning, wearing shirts with the images of Blazic's victims."

      "LONDON -- British military veterans who were discharged or suffered other forms of discrimination because of their sexual orientation or gender identity will receive up to 70,000 pounds ($89,300) under a government compensation program announced Thursday.",
      "Prior to 2000, service personnel who were discovered to be lesbian, gay or trans were forced to leave the military under policies that designated them as unfit to serve in the armed forces. Many others were subjected to brutal investigations into allegations about their sexual orientation.",

Russian forces are trying to overwhelm Ukraine\u2019s battlefield defenses with sheer numbers of troops and powerful glide bombs that blast fortifications to smithereens.",
      "Pokrovsk, which had a population of about 60,000 before Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, is one of Ukraine\u2019s main defensive strongholds and a key logistics hub in the Donetsk region. Its capture would compromise Ukraine\u2019s defensive abilities and supply routes and would bring Russia closer to its stated goal of seizing the entire Donetsk region.",

The accused men were \u201cassociated with the police\u201d in Vietnam and had met with officers at the police training college near Wellington, New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon told reporters Thursday.",

      "Yoon\u2019s statement, which came on the 45th anniversary of a coup orchestrated by the country\u2019s last military strongman Chun Doo-hwan, deepens the political turmoil that has paralyzed politics, halted diplomatic activities and rattled financial markets.",
      "Yoon spoke before opposition parties submitted a new impeachment motion against him for a floor vote this weekend. The main opposition Democratic Party accused the president of attempting to incite his far-right supporters to stage riots ahead of Saturday's impeachment vote at the National Assembly.",
      "Here's a look at the whirlwind events since last week that shook up one of Asia\u2019s most robust democracies:",
      "In a surprise announcement at 10:29 p.m., President Yoon tells a national television audience he\u2019s declaring martial law, saying the opposition-controlled parliament has become a \u201cden of criminals\u201d paralyzing government affairs.",
      "Yoon vows to \u201ceradicate\u201d his political rivals, describing them as North Korea-sympathizing, \u201canti-state forces\u201d responsible for \u201cwreaking havoc and are the main culprits of our nation\u2019s downfall.\u201d He doesn\u2019t back his claims with direct evidence.",
      "In reaction, the main opposition Democratic Party calls for an emergency meeting.",
      "As lawmakers begin rushing to the National Assembly, the military\u2019s martial law command issues a proclamation declaring sweeping government powers, including the suspension of political parties\u2019 activities and other political gatherings that could cause \u201csocial confusion\u201d and control over media and publications. It says anyone who violates the decree could be arrested without warrant.",
      "Hundreds of heavily-armed troops encircle the Assembly, in an apparent attempt to prevent lawmakers from gathering to hold a vote to lift the martial law declaration. Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung live-streams his journey to the Assembly from a car, pleading for people to converge on the parliament to help lawmakers get inside. The shaky footage later shows him climbing over a fence to get onto the grounds.",
      "Shortly after midnight, National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik says through his YouTube channel that the Assembly will respond to Yoon\u2019s martial law declaration with \u201cconstitutional procedure.\"",
      "Also climbing over a fence, Woo reaches the Assembly\u2019s main chamber at around 12:35 a.m. Some South Korean troops break windows to enter the parliament building but fail to reach the main chamber. Woo opens a meeting at 12:47 a.m. to hold a vote on whether to lift martial law.",
      "At around 1:00 a.m., 190 lawmakers, including 18 from Yoon\u2019s own conservative People Power Party, voted unanimously to lift martial law. Troops and police begin to retreat from the Assembly shortly later.",
      "At 4:30 a.m., Yoon\u2019s martial law is formally lifted following a Cabinet meeting.",
      "Hours later, opposition parties submit a motion to impeach Yoon. They say his martial law declaration is a blatant violation of the constitution, which limits the presidential exercise of such emergency powers during wartime or comparable national emergencies, and doesn\u2019t allow for the suspension of parliamentary activities under any situation.",
      "\u201cIt was a grave act of rebellion and provides perfect grounds for his impeachment,\u201d the Democratic Party said.",
      "Yoon replaces his Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun, a close associate believed to be the person who recommended the president declare martial law.

      "In a bombshell reversal, Han expresses support for suspending the constitutional powers of Yoon, saying that the president poses a \u201csignificant risk of extreme actions, like reattempting to impose martial law, which could potentially put the Republic of Korea and its citizens in great danger.\u201d",
      "Han says he received intelligence that Yoon had ordered the country\u2019s counterintelligence commander to arrest and detain key politicians based on accusations of \u201canti-state activities\u201d during the brief period martial law was in force.",
      "A high-ranking spy official tells lawmakers that the politicians targeted for detainment included Han, National Assembly speaker Woo and opposition leader Lee.",

      "Yoon survives the opposition-led attempt to impeach him, as most ruling party lawmakers boycotted a parliamentary vote to deny a two-thirds majority needed to suspend his presidential powers.",
      "The vote came hours after Yoon issued an apology over the martial law decree, saying he won\u2019t shirk legal or political responsibility for the declaration. Yoon says he would leave it to his party to chart a course through the country\u2019s political turmoil, \u201cincluding matters related to my term in office.\u201d",

      "HONG KONG -- A Hong Kong judge on Thursday convicted seven people, including a pro-democracy former lawmaker, of rioting during mob violence at a subway station at the height of the city\u2019s anti-government protests in July 2019.",
      "Prosecutors accused former legislator Lam Cheuk-ting and the six other defendants of provoking members of a group of about 100 men armed with wooden poles and metal rods who attacked protesters and bystanders at a train station. The men, all clad in white shirts, in contrast with the black worn by protesters, claimed to be protecting their homeland in Yuen Long, a residential district in Hong Kong's New Territories.",
      "Dozens of people, including Lam, were injured in the violence, a key chapter that escalated the protest movement as the public criticized police for their delayed response. The landmark ruling could shape the city's historical narrative of the incident.",
      "Judge Stanley Chan ruled that Lam was not acting as a mediator as he had claimed, but rather was trying to exploit the situation for political gain.",
      "He said Lam's words directed at the white-shirted men had \u201cfanned the flames.\"",
      "The seven defendants are expected to be sentenced in February. Several members of the public sitting in the gallery cried after hearing the verdicts. Others waved at the defendants, with one shouting to Lam, \u201cHang in there, Ting!\u201d Lam appeared to be at ease.",
      "The prosecution alleged the defendants had either berated the white-shirted men, used obscene hand gestures, hurled objects or shot jets of water at them with a hosepipe.",
      "The defendants had pleaded not guilty to the rioting charge.",
      "During the trial, Lam said he chose to go to Yuen Long because he hoped his then position as a lawmaker could pressure the police to act quickly. He said he could not leave the scene while fellow residents were in danger. Some defendants who targeted the white-shirted men with a hosepipe argued that they were just trying to stop the attackers from advancing.",
      "Chan, the judge, rejected the arguments of some defendants that they acted in self-defense.",
      "The 2019 protests were sparked by a proposed extradition law that would have allowed criminal suspects in Hong Kong to be sent to the mainland for trial. The government withdrew the bill, but the protesters widened their demands to include direct elections for the city\u2019s leaders and police accountability.",
      "The social movement was the biggest challenge to the Hong Kong government since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997. In response, Beijing imposed a national security law in 2020, leading to the arrest of many activists. Others were silenced or went into exile.",
      "In November, Lam was sentenced to six years and nine months in jail in the city's biggest national security case.",
      "More than 10,000 people were arrested in connection to the protests for various crimes, such as rioting and participating in an unauthorized assembly. About 10 white-shirted men were convicted in other cases related to the mob violence in July 2019, local media reported."

      "BRUSSELS -- European Union ministers on Thursday agreed to let Bulgaria and Romania fully integrate into Europe\u2019s ID-check-free travel zone, known as the Schengen area, by lifting land border controls from next year, the EU's Hungarian presidency said.",
      "Bulgaria and Romania joined the Schengen area in March after years of negotiations, providing free access for travelers arriving in both countries by air or sea.",

      "He added that Romania would \u201ccontinue to act responsibly to protect and strengthen the EU\u2019s external borders\u201d to manage illegal migration.",
      "The Schengen Area was established in 1985. Before Bulgaria and Romania\u2019s partial admission, it was comprised of 23 of the 27 EU member countries, along with Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Around 3.5 million people cross an internal border each day.",
      "Economists from the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences calculated that with the decision, the total positive financial effect for Bulgaria would amount to 800 million euro ($840 million) per year.",

      "\u201cThis is a well-deserved result of all our efforts over the past years, efforts made by all employees of the ministry of internal affairs,\u201d he said. \u201cThese efforts included physical security at the Bulgarian-Turkish border, using all available resources.\u201d",

      "\u201cIf there\u2019s no border check that will save a lot of nerves (and) delays,\" said Nikolay Iliev, another truck driver waiting at Kulata. \u201cWe are fully accepted in Schengen, and that makes me very happy.\u201d",
      "The Schengen area is one of the main achievements of the European project.

      "Nigeria is the latest African country to give a new malaria vaccine to young childen",
      "BAYELSA, Nigeria -- Ominike Marvis has lost count of the number of times her 6-year-old son has had malaria. So when Nigeria started offering a malaria vaccine, she was eager to protect her youngest child.",
      "She took the 6-month-old baby to get his first shot at a health center in hard-hit Bayelsa state, where the country's vaccination campaign kicked off last week. The vaccine aims to prevent severe illnesses and deaths from the mosquito-borne disease.",
      "\u201cAt least I know he\u2019s safe from it now,\u201d Marvis, 31, said.",
      "Africa accounts for the vast majority of malaria in the world. Nigeria, the continent's most populous country, has the biggest burden with about a quarter of the cases.",
      "According to a World Health Organization report released Wednesday, there were an estimated 263 million cases of malaria and 597,000 deaths worldwide last year, mostly in children under 5. That is 11 million more malaria cases compared to 2022 with nearly the same number of deaths.",
      "\u201cNo one should die of malaria, yet the disease continues to disproportionately harm people living in the African region, especially young children and pregnant women,\u201d said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, calling for more support.",
      "There are now 17 countries giving new malaria vaccines to young children, the WHO report said. Nigeria began its campaign last week, offering a vaccine developed by Oxford University.",
      "Research suggests it is more than 75% effective at preventing severe disease and death in the first year and that protection is extended for at least another year with a booster.",
      "Nigeria\u2019s health minister, Muhammad Ali Pate, called the vaccination campaign a \u201cmonumental step\u201d in the country\u2019s efforts to eliminate malaria.",
      "The disease is caused by a parasite that is spread through mosquito bites. Experts say other measures like bed nets and insecticide spraying remain essential to curb the disease.",
      "Experts say Nigeria's population of more than 210 million people, as well as its climate, contribute to its high malaria burden, but so do other factors like poor sanitation and limited tools like treated bed nets.",
      "Besides the lack of funding, WHO report said countries with malaria still grapple with fragile health systems, weak surveillance and drug and insecticide resistance.",
      "But progress has also been made on several fronts, the report said, including in the African region where countries have achieved a 16% reduction in malaria deaths since 2015. And in 83 countries where malaria is present, 25 of them now report fewer than 10 cases a year, the report said.",
      "In the oil-rich but poor Bayelsa state, among the worst-hit in Nigeria, malaria is so common in riverside communities that mothers spoke of how no one in their family has been spared.",
      "\u201cHere, malaria is something we are used to,\u201d said Claris Okah, a community health worker.",
      "Among the challenges health workers like Okah face is hesitancy among parents, so they are educating families about the new vaccine and other steps to prevent malaria.",
      "\u201cThe vaccine is a good thing,\" Okah siad.",

      "The European Central Bank is cutting interest rates by a quarter percentage point amid signs of weakening growth and concern about the impact of political chaos in France and the possibility of new U.S. import tariffs",
      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- The European Central Bank has cut rates by a quarter percentage point amid signs of weakening growth and concern about the impact of political chaos in France and the possibility of new U.S. import tariffs.",
      "The bank\u2019s rate-setting committee made the decision Thursday at its skyscraper headquarters in Frankfurt to lower the benchmark from 3.25% to 3%.",
      "The bank said that efforts to return inflation to its 2% target were succeeding.",
      "\u201cThe disinflation process is well on track,\u201d it said in a statement accompanying the decision. It cautioned that it now foresaw \u201ca slower economic recovery\u201d than it did in a last set of projections in September.",
      "Lower rates should support growth amid signs that the post-pandemic recovery is slowing in the 20 countries that use the euro currency and concerns that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump might impose new tariffs, or import taxes, on goods imported to the US after he is inaugurated Jan. 20. That sends a cold chill through the business world in Europe, where exports are an outsized contributor to growth and employment.",
      "Yet there are internal risks as well.",
      "French Prime Minister Michel Barnier resigned Dec. 5 after losing a vote of confidence, leaving the France without a functioning government and no clear majority in parliament able or willing to tackle the country\u2019s excessive budget deficit. Elections cannot be held before June. While the end of the Barnier government hasn't triggered a financial crisis, it adds uncertainty about how long it will take for France to right its finances.",
      "Germany's governing coalition broke up in November, and a new national election is expected Feb. 23. Weeks of coalition negotiations are expected to follow before a new government is in place. That leaves the two biggest eurozone economies politically adrift for months.",
      "All that has dinged the confidence that businesses need to borrow, invest, expand production and take risks. The survey index of purchasing managers compiled by S&P Global came in at 48.3 in November, with levels below 50 suggesting the economy is slowing. The Sentix survey of investor confidence fell in its first update after the U.S. election, by 4.6 points to minus 17.5.",
      "Inflation has fallen steeply to 2.3% from its peak of 10.6% in late 2022, shifting attention from reigning in consumer price increases to worries about ongoing weak growth. The eurozone is expected to grow 0.8% this year and 1.3.% next year, according to forecasts from the European Union's executive commission.",
      "Higher ECB rates helped squelch Europe\u2019s outbreak of inflation in the wake of the pandemic and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Higher central bank benchmarks influence borrowing costs throughout the economy, making it more expensive to borrow and spend, and thus taking pressure off prices.",
      "Yet that also presents a danger in that those same high rates could stall the EU's goal of more vigorous economic growth.",
      "A drumbeat of announcements regarding job cuts in coming years at major firms in Germany has not improved the mood. They include auto technology and parts firm Bosch, which plans to drop 5,500 jobs, 3,800 of them in Germany; auto supplier ZF Friedrichshafen, which plans to drop 14,000-15,000 jobs; and Ford Motor Co., which is to drop 4,000 jobs in Europe, 2,900 in Germany, and steelmaker ThyssenKrupp with 11,000 planned cuts. Volkswagen plans to shut as many as three German plants, according to its employee representatives who are negotiating with the company in an effort to block the closings.",

    "story": [
      "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is capping the fees at $5 with a rule set to take effect in October 2025, if it isn't overturned by Congress or altered under a Trump administration",
      "NEW YORK -- The Biden administration has finalized a rule limiting overdraft fees banks can charge, as part of the White House's campaign to reduce junk fees that hit consumers on everyday purchases, including banking services. President Joe Biden had called the fees, which can be as high as $35, \u201cexploitative,\u201d while the banking industry has lobbied extensively to keep the existing fee structures in place.",
      "Under the finalized rule, banks will be able to choose from three options: they may charge a flat overdraft fee of $5, they may charge a fee that covers their costs and losses, or they may charge any fee so long as they disclose the terms of the overdraft loan the way they would for any other loan, typically expressed as an annual percentage rate, or APR.",
      "While banks have cut back on overdraft fees in the past decade, the nation\u2019s biggest banks still take in roughly $8 billion in the charges every year, according to data from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and bank public records. Currently, there is no cap on the overdraft fees that banks can legally charge.",
      "Right now, when a bank temporarily lends a consumer money when their account has reached a zero balance, the consumer is typically responsible for paying back both the overdrawn amount and an additional fee, which can be more than the original amount charged. In one example often cited by opponents of the fees, a $3 cup of coffee can end up costing someone more than $30.",
      "The finalized rule is set to take effect in October 2025, but the incoming Trump administration has yet to tap anyone to lead the CFPB, and has mentioned the idea of eliminating the agency.",
      "The finalized rule applies to banks and credit unions that have more than $10 billion in assets, which includes the nation\u2019s largest banks. Banks have previously sued the CFPB over these rules and caps on credit card late fees, and are likely to sue again. Congress also has the ability to challenge or overturn the rule.",
      "Overdraft fees originated during a time when consumers wrote and cashed checks more frequently \u2014 so that the checks would clear instead of bouncing, if there was an issue of timing \u2014 but banks steadily increased the fees in the first two decades of the 2000s. The fees disproportionately affect banks\u2019 most cash-strapped consumers. A majority of overdrafts (70%) are charged to customers with average account balances between $237 and $439, according to the CFPB.",
      "The agency estimates the new rule would save consumers about $5 billion in annual overdraft fees, or $225 per household that typically experiences the fees.",

It also would have required companies to publicly disclose statistics on the demographic composition of their boards.",

      "\u201cIt is not unethical for a company to decline to disclose information about the racial, gender, and LGTBQ+ characteristics of its directors,\u201d the ruling stated. \u201cWe are not aware of any established rule or custom of the securities trade that saddles companies with an obligation to explain why their boards of directors do not have as much racial, gender, or sexual orientation diversity as Nasdaq would prefer.\u201d",

      "The Labor Department reported Thursday that its producer price index \u2014 which tracks inflation before it reaches consumers \u2014 rose 0.4% last month from October, up from 0.3% the month before. Measured from 12 months earlier, wholesale prices climbed 3% in November, the sharpest year-over-year rise since February 2023.",

      "The wholesale price report comes a day after the government reported that consumer prices rose 2.7% in November from a year earlier, up from an annual gain of 2.6% in October. The increase, fueled by pricier used cars, hotel rooms and groceries, showed that elevated inflation has yet to be fully tamed.",
      "Inflation in consumer prices has plummeted from a four-decade high 9.1% in June 2022. Yet despite having reached relatively low levels, it has so far remained persistently above the Fed\u2019s 2% target.",
      "Despite the modest upticks in inflation last month, the Federal Reserve is poised to cut its benchmark interest rate next week for a third consecutive time. In 2022 and 2023, the Fed raised its key short-term rate 11 times \u2014 to a two-decade high \u2014 in a drive to reverse an inflationary surge that followed the economy's unexpectedly strong recovery from the COVID-19 recession. The steady cooling of inflation led the central bank, starting in the fall, to begin reversing that move.",
      "In September, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate, which affects many consumer and business loans, by a sizable half-point. It followed that move with a quarter-point rate cut in November. Those cuts lowered the central bank\u2019s key rate to 4.6%, down from a four-decade high of 5.3%.",

Economists also watch it because some of its components, notably healthcare and financial services, flow into the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge \u2014 the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, index.",
      "Despite the overall uptick in producer prices, Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics noted in a commentary that the components that feed into the PCE index were \u201cuniversally weak\" in November and make it even more likely that the Fed will cut its benchmark rate next week.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s forthcoming agenda has raised concerns about the future path of inflation and whether the Fed will continue to cut rates. Though Trump has vowed to force prices down, in part by encouraging oil and gas drilling, some of his other campaign vows \u2014 to impose massive taxes on imports, for example, and to deport millions of immigrants working illegally in the United States \u2014 are widely seen as inflationary.",

      "Civic engagement nonprofits believe democracy is an exercise in need of constant support \u2014 not just extra money around major major campaigns",
      "NEW YORK -- A nonprofit law group dedicated to protecting the rights of Southern voters of color had more on its plate this year than just the 2024 presidential election.",
      "The Southern Coalition for Social Justice hosts voter registration drives and monitors election certification. Staff attorneys help run a legal hotline for voting irregularities. Teams challenge electoral maps and restrictive laws deemed unfair. It's costly, year-round work that senior counsel Mitchell Brown considers vital to participatory democracy \u2014 but also work that gets less attention outside of high-profile campaign cycles.",
      "\u201cA lot of people exert a lot of energy during the presidential year and it falls off for the next three to four years,\" Brown said. \"That can\u2019t happen. Because there\u2019s a lot of changes that are occurring in between those four years between presidential elections.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are no more off years anymore,\" he added.",
      "The coalition benefited this spring from a progressive philanthropic network organized around the belief that democracy is an exercise \u2014 not a given \u2014 in need of constant support. Led by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar\u2019s Democracy Fund, petitioners pledged to reverse existing boom-and-bust dynamics where money floods politically engaged nonprofits late into election years only to dry up afterward. Beginning with the \u201cAll by April\u201d campaign to move money early, the effort is continuing with the \u201cElection Day to Every Day\u201d push to shore up next year's funding.",
      "However, according to interviews with other nonprofit leaders in the left-leaning civic space, the philanthropic sector at large has not heeded the call. For the nonprofit leaders experiencing budgets as usual, the anticipated pattern of funding drop-offs is raising stakes many leaders felt were already heightened by the fraught political climate.",
      "With reported security threats and staff burnout, Democracy Fund President Joe Goldman said it's especially inefficient to spend millions training people, developing skills and creating a knowledge base only to cut nonprofit budgets and \"throw it away.\u201d Despite what Democracy Fund said was widespread agreement that democracy is under threat, the organization found that many funders had no plans before September to help grantees prepare for the post-election environment.",
      "\u201cWe need to show them that we've got their backs,\" Goldman said.",
      "Grassroots nonprofits \u2014 both \u201c501(c)3\" groups, named after the tax code section they were organized under, which are restricted from party politics altogether, and \u201c501(c)4\" organizations, which are allowed limited partisan activity \u2014 believe their bottom-up approach positions them well to engage their communities in local politics.",
      "That might take the form of deep canvassing. Unlike political canvassers who knock on doors and call numbers to sway votes, deep canvassers have longer conversations with strangers about their concerns and desires. The idea is to form connections that eventually change hearts and minds on divisive topics. Or, it might look like mobilizing residents around single issues in their backyards.",
      "Groups that spent 2020 doing such work felt drained afterward, according to Women Donors Network President Leena Barakat, whose group signed the Election Day to Every Day petition. The election had high turnout. But money and energy were depleted, she said, and there was scant capacity for sustaining political engagement with democratic processes. By the time 2024 rolled around, many civically-minded nonprofits were still playing catch up with their staffing levels. Any financial windfall this year wouldn\u2019t have been enough to effectively organize in just six months.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t show up for just an election day. They are there to really understand and meet the needs of their community year-round,\u201d said Women Donors Network President Leena Barakat, whose group signed the Election Day to Every Day petition. \u201cTo just fund them around elections is incredibly transactional and less effective in the work that we are trying to do. Change moves at the speed of trust.\u201d",
      "The effort's proponents suggest financial backing to form those ties is limited in part because the work goes unseen to funders. Philanthropists tend to prefer projects that can be measured easily and quickly, the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy Senior Research Manager Katherine Ponce noted. But Ponce said the work of relationship development and trust building is difficult to quantify and happens slowly.",
      "Explicitly electoral work understandably gets a lot of resources during election years, according to Alice Evans of the Southeast Immigrant Rights Network. It makes sense to focus on efforts like get-out-the-vote events, she said, but it also makes it harder for SIRN to support what she called \u201cvery democracy-related work.\u201d The nonprofit coalition of more than 50 immigrant- and refugee-led groups provides leadership trainings for the heads of immigration-focused organizations and \u201cKnow Your Rights\u201d toolkits for their communities.",
      "Evans, who oversees fundraising, said she is bracing for organizing conditions to grow \u201cmore hostile\u201d under the incoming Trump administration; SIRN is preparing a \u201crapid response fund\u201d in anticipation of immigration crackdowns.",
      "\u201cIn order for a democracy to function and be healthy, we need people understanding their rights,\" Evans said. \"Understanding and taking up their part in co-creating democracy. And instead, I think often these days, it feels like we often understand democracy as this transactional thing that we sort of receive.\u201d",
      "DoSomething is a nonprofit that encourages youth participation by providing opportunities to volunteer and organize. But DoSomething CEO DeNora Getachew said funders told her that youth are not a strategic investment despite 41 million Gen Z members being eligible to vote this year.",
      "Money flowed across the philanthropic sector during the first half of the year, DoSomething Vice President of Development Katie Tynes said, but the overall spigot seemed to tighten in the second half. Tynes said she also saw funding shift from 501(c)3s to 501(c)4s. While there\u2019s room for both types of tax-exempt organizations, she said, it was troubling because the former tend to do more people-centered work on the ground whereas the latter have more political agendas.",
      "Speaking anecdotally, Getachew said she saw a decline this year in funding for nonprofit groups like hers focused on evergreen civic engagement.",
      "\u201cThis very cyclical, very transactional rush to register young people to vote, get them to turn out to vote and then bid them adieu in those in-between years \u2014 if we don't develop the civic muscle of young people early and then ensure that they practice that muscle consistently, I think we're going to have a big challenge with the viability of our democracy long-term,\u201d she said.",
      "Still, the \u201cAll by April\u201d campaign claimed some success. Democracy Fund reported sparking $79 million in new 501(c)3 grants for election-related work and $61 million in money disbursed sooner than planned. Brown said the Southern Coalition for Social Justice was able to hire three new attorneys with the influx of donations spurred by the springtime push to provide funding earlier into the election cycle.",

      "DoorDash will require its drivers to verify their identity more often as part of a larger effort to crack down on unauthorized account sharing.",
      "DoorDash has been under pressure to ensure its drivers are operating legally. Over the summer, it pledged to do a better job identifying and removing dangerous drivers after a flood of complaints of dangerous driving from cities. Officials in Boston, New York and other cities have said that in many cases, people with multiple traffic violations continue making deliveries using accounts registered to others.",
      "The San Francisco delivery company said Thursday it has begun requiring some drivers to complete real-time identity checks immediately after they complete a delivery. Previously, drivers were occasionally asked to re-verify their identity before or after a shift. The new system has been introduced in Los Angeles, Denver, Seattle and other cities and will roll out more widely next year.",
      "DoorDash said it has also developed an advanced machine learning system that can flag potential unauthorized account access, including login anomalies and suspicious activity. If the company detects a problem it will require the driver to re-verify their identity before they can make more deliveries.",
      "Before U.S. drivers can make DoorDash deliveries, they must verify their identity with a driver\u2019s license or other government-issued identification and upload a selfie that matches their identification photo. They also must submit to a background check, which requires a Social Security number.",
      "But the company has found that some drivers are getting around those requirements by sharing accounts with authorized users. In some cases, drivers who haven\u2019t been authorized to drive for DoorDash are paying authorized users for access to their accounts.",
      "Some federal lawmakers have also demanded that DoorDash and other delivery apps do a better job of keeping illegal immigrants off their platforms. Republican U.S. Sens. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Mike Braun of Indiana and Ted Budd of North Carolina sent letters to delivery companies in April asking them to crack down on account sharing.",
      "\u201cThese illegal immigrants are delivering food directly to consumers\u2019 doors without ever having undergone a background check and often without even using their real names,\u201d the letter said. It added that working illegally can also be dangerous for migrants, creating the potential for exploitation and abuse.",
      "DoorDash won\u2019t estimate how many drivers are using shared accounts, but said its safeguards are effective. Last year, it began asking drivers to re-verify their identities monthly by submitting a selfie. The company said it is now asking more than 150,000 drivers to complete selfie checks each week, and it\u2019s removing them from the platform if they don\u2019t comply."

      "But so far, the measures taken this year to jolt the economy out of its post-pandemic doldrums have been broad in scope but more incremental and technical than the dramatic stimulus that investors have been hoping for.",
      "The CCTV report said China would raise its fiscal deficit and continue to issue \u201csuper-long\u201d government bonds to help finance additional spending. It gave no details on the amount of money to be spent or size of the deficit.",
      "Leaders pledged to stabilize the property market, which has been mired in a downturn after a crackdown several years ago on excess borrowing by property developers.",
      "They also promised to boost consumer spending by countering weakness in the job market and seeing that wages keep pace with economic growth.",

      "NEW YORK -- President-elect Donald Trump rang the opening bell Thursday at the New York Stock Exchange after being recognized for the second time by Time magazine as its person of the year.",
      "The honors for the businessman-turned-politician are a measure of Trump's remarkable comeback from an ostracized former president who refused to accept his election loss four years ago to a president-elect who won the White House decisively in November.",
      "Before he rang the opening bell at 9:30 a.m., a first for him, Trump spoke at the exchange and called it \u201ca tremendous honor.\u201d",
      "\u201cTime magazine, getting this honor for the second time, I think I like it better this time actually,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump, accompanied by his wife, Melania Trump, daughters Ivanka and Tiffany and Vice President-elect JD Vance, grinned as people chanted \u201cUSA\u201d before he opened the trading day. He then raised his fist.",
      "In his remarks, he talked up some of the people he has named to his incoming administration, including Treasury pick Scott Bessent, and some of his announced policies, including a promise this week that the federal government will issue expedited permits, including environmental approvals, for projects and construction worth more than $1 billion.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re going to have a tremendous run. We have to straighten out some problems, some big problems in the world,\u201d he said.",
      "Sam Jacobs, Time's editor in chief, announced on NBC's \u201cToday\u201d show that Trump was Time\u2019s 2024 Person of the Year. Jacobs said Trump was someone who \u201cfor better or for worse, had the most influence on the news in 2024.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is someone who made an historic comeback, who reshaped the American presidency and who\u2019s reordering American politics,\" Jacobs said. \"It\u2019s hard to argue with the fact that the person who\u2019s moving into the Oval Office is the most influential person in news.\"",
      "In an interview with the magazine published Thursday, Trump spoke about his final campaign blitz and election win.",
      "\u201cI called it \u201872 Days of Fury,\u2019\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe hit the nerve of the country. The country was angry.\u201d",
      "Trump was on Wall Street to mark the ceremonial start of the day\u2019s trading. The Time magazine cover featuring him was projected onto a wall at the stock exchange, flanked by American flags.",
      "Trump took the stage at the exchange flanked by family members and members of his incoming administration while his favored walk-on song, \u201cGod Bless the U.S.A.,\u201d played.",
      "Trump was also Time's Person of the Year in 2016, when he was first elected to the White House. He was listed as a finalist for this year\u2019s award alongside notables including Vice President Kamala Harris, X owner Elon Musk, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Kate, the Princess of Wales.",
      "Jacobs, in making the announcement Thursday, said that \u201cthere\u2019s always a hot debate\u201d at the magazine over the honor, \u201calthough I have to admit that this year was an easier decision than years past.\u201d",
      "The NYSE regularly invites celebrities and business leaders to participate in the 9:30 a.m. ceremonial opening trading. Thursday will be Trump's first time doing the honors, which have become a marker of culture and politics.",
      "Trump has long had a fascination with being on the cover of Time, where he first made an appearance in 1989. He has falsely claimed to hold the record for cover appearances, and The Washington Post reported in 2017 that Trump had a fake picture of himself on the cover of the magazine hanging in several of his golf country clubs.",
      "Earlier this year, Trump sat for interviews with the magazine for a story that ran in April. Time\u2019s billionaire owner, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, criticized Harris for not granting the magazine an interview during her campaign with Trump.",
      "In his latest interview published Thursday, Trump reiterated that he\u2019s going to pardon most of those convicted in riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. \u201cIt\u2019s going to start in the first hour,\u201d he said of the pardons. \u201cMaybe the first nine minutes.\u201d",
      "Trump said he would not ask members of his administration to sign a loyalty pledge. \u201cI think I will be able to, for the most part, determine who\u2019s loyal,\u201d he said. But he said he will fire anyone who doesn\u2019t follow his policies.",
      "On the war in Gaza, Trump said he wants to end the conflict and that Netanyahu knows it. When Trump was asked whether he trusted Netanyahu, he told Time: \u201cI don\u2019t trust anybody.\u201d",
      "The incoming president also discussed his plans for mass deportations and argued he will have the authority to use the military to assist with the effort, even though, as the magazine notes, the Posse Comitatus Act forbids the deployment of the military against civilians.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t stop the military if it\u2019s an invasion of our country,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll only do what the law allows, but I will go up to the maximum level of what the law allows.\u201d",
      "Trump crafted his image as a wealthy real estate developer, which he played up as the star of the TV reality show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d and during his presidential campaign. He won the election in part by channeling Americans' anxieties about the economy\u2019s ability to provide for the middle class.",
      "In an interview on CNBC after he rang the bell, Trump likened the broad cuts to the federal workforce that he and his advisers have telegraphed to the TV firings he made of contestants.",

      "The survey of 3.5 million households covers more than 40 topics, including ancestry, fertility, marital status, commutes, veterans status, disability and housing.",
      "The decrease in grandparents' taking care of their grandchildren is most likely because opioid-related deaths stabilized and then declined during the more recent timeframe since substance abuse is a leading reason grandparents find themselves raising grandchildren. A reduction in the number of incarcerated women also likely played a role, said Susan Kelley, a professor emerita of nursing at Georgia State University.",
      "\u201cIt's very rarely for positive reasons that grandparents find themselves in this situation. Usually, it's a tragic situation in an adult child's life \u2014 either a death, incarceration or mental health issues which correlate with substance abuse,\" Kelley said. \"Many grandparents thrive in that role, but there are still socioeconomic and emotional burdens on the grandparents.\"",
      "A stronger economy in the most recent period also may be a reason the number of grandparents living with their grandchildren declined from 7.2 million to 6.8 million by making it less likely that adult children with their own children were seeking housing help from their parents, she said.",
      "The decline in the number of young children enrolled in preschool stemmed from an unwillingness to send young children to school and the closure of many schools at the height of the pandemic, according to the Census Bureau.",

It\u2019s hoping to support a slowing job market  after getting inflation nearly all the way down to its 2% target.",

      "New Jersey is seeking to drastically reduce the amount of plastics and other packaging material that's tossed out once a package is opened",
      "TRENTON, N.J. -- New Jersey is aiming to drastically reduce the amount of packaging material \u2014 particularly plastic \u2014 that is thrown away after the package is opened.",
      "From bubble wrap to puffy air-filled plastic pockets to those foam peanuts that seem to immediately spill all over the floor, lots of what keeps items safe during shipping often ends up in landfills, or in the environment as pollution.",
      "A bill to be discussed Thursday in the state Legislature would require all such materials used in the state to be recyclable or compostable by 2034. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says containers and packaging materials from shopping account for about 28% of municipal waste sent to landfills in the U.S.",
      "The New Jersey bill seeks to move away from plastics and imposes fees on manufacturers and distributors for a $120 million fund to bolster recycling and reduce solid waste.",
      "California, Colorado, Oregon, Maine, and Minnesota have already passed similar bills, according to the environmental group Beyond Plastics.",
      "New Jersey's bill as proposed would be the strongest in the nation, according to Doug O'Malley, director of Environment New Jersey.",
      "\u201cOur waterways are literally swimming in plastics,\" he said. \u201cWe can't recycle our way out of this crisis.\u201d",
      "Peter Blair, policy and advocacy director at the environmental group Just Zero, said the bill aims to shift financial responsibility for dealing with the \u201cend-of-life\u201d of plastic packaging from taxpayers, who pay to have it sent to landfills, to the producers of the material.",
      "Business groups oppose the legislation.",
      "Ray Cantor, an official with the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, said businesses are constantly working to reduce the amount of packing materials they use, and to increase the amount of recyclables they utilize. He called the bill \u201cunrealistic\u201d and \u201cnot workable.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt totally ignores the 40 years of work and systems that has made New Jersey one of the most successful recycling states in the nation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt bans a host of chemicals without any scientific basis. And it would ban the advanced recycling of plastics, the most promising new technology to recycle materials that currently are thrown away.\u201d",
      "His organization defined advanced recycling as \u201cusing high temperatures and pressure, breaking down the chemicals in plastics and turning them back into their base chemicals, thus allowing them to be reused to make new plastics as if they were virgin materials.\u201d",
      "Brooke Helmick, policy director for the New Jersey Environmental Justice Alliance, said advanced recycling can be \u201cvery, very dangerous.\u201d It can lead to the release of toxic chemicals, cause fires, create the risk of chemical leaks, and create large volumes of hazardous materials including benzene that are then incinerated, she said.",
      "The bill would require the state Department of Environmental Protection to study the state's recycling market and calculate the cost of upgrading it to handle the increased recycling of packaging materials.",
      "It would require that by 2032, the amount of single-use packaging products used in the state be reduced by 25%, at least 10% of which would have to come from shifting to reusable products or eliminating plastic components.",
      "By 2034, all packaging products used in the state would have to be compostable or recyclable, and by 2036, the recycling rate of packaging products in New Jersey would have to be at least 65%.",

    "story": [
      "Kaja Veilleux has been hunting New England attic treasures for more than 50 years",
      "THOMASTON, Maine -- Kaja Veilleux has been hunting New England attic treasures for more than 50 years. He once found a copy of the Declaration of Independence sitting on a pile of trash, and he made headlines this year when he stumbled upon a million-dollar portrait gathering dust in an old farmhouse in Maine that may have been painted by the Dutch master Rembrandt.",
      "Then there was the time, Veilleux said, he was shown a $50,000 gold coin kicking around in a tool drawer \u2014 only to have the well-meaning owner destroy much of its value before he could auction it by using a scouring pad to clean it \u2014 and scratch it.",
      "\u201cIt's like a treasure hunt every day,\" Veilleux said with a chuckle.",
      "Many people dream of cashing in on some dusty, old heirloom. In October, three sisters from Ohio sold a rare dime for more than half-a-million dollars. Two years ago, a case of old hockey cards found in a Canadian home sold for more than $3.7 million.",
      "Veilleux, 73, helps people sort gems from junk when he appraises furniture, antiques and art by using his knowledge of what similar items have sold for in the past. But art auctions can be fickle. Who could have guessed a banana duct-taped to a wall could sell for more than $6 million?",
      "Veilleux started collecting coins at age 8 and soon found he had a good memory for visual objects. His training for a career in antique dealing has all been on the job, he said, including a lesson he learned early when he spent most of the money he had at the time on bidding for a beautiful miniature painting.",
      "When he got home from the auction and looked at the artwork under a magnifying glass, he realized it was a print, with dabs of paint added to make it look genuine.",
      "\u201cI paid $350 for a $35 object, which always taught me to look at things very carefully,\u201d Veilleux said.",
      "In the late 1990s, he was at a house call in South Freeport, Maine. It was a hoarder's house, he said, where piles of trash were awaiting their trip to an already-full dumpster. Atop one pile, Veilleux spotted what was later confirmed to be a 1776 copy of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "He auctioned it for $99,000 but the state of Maine sued to take possession of the document, and won. That meant both the buyer and seller ended up missing out.",
      "This year's artwork find was his most valuable yet. Veilleux said he and an assistant were on a house call in Camden, Maine.",
      "\u201cWe start going through the house and there were rare little things and big things everywhere,\u201d Veilleux said. \u201cFinally, we are on the third floor near the attic, and we find a stack of paintings, and in it is this beautiful portrait of a young woman by Rembrandt.\u201d",
      "The painting of a teenage girl in a black dress with a white ruffled collar was sold as \u201cafter Rembrandt,\u201d meaning it was in the style of the 17th Century master but wasn't proven to be by him. The artwork sold for $1.4 million, including auction fees, indicating the buyer was willing to take a significant gamble the painting was a Rembrandt \u2014 although it would have likely sold for many times that price with a proven provenance.",
      "Each Tuesday, people bring in their heirlooms and collector\u2019s items to Veilleux's office in Thomaston, Maine, to see what they might fetch at auction. The appraisal is free but Veilleux gets a commission if they end up selling the pieces at his Thomaston Place Auction Galleries.",
      "Erika Taylor stopped by on a recent Tuesday with two artworks her father had collected in China in the 1940s, when he was living there after escaping from Nazi Germany. One depicted a blooming peony and the other a grasshopper.",
      "She said Veilleux had given her an initial estimate of up to $30,000 for each of the artworks, based on the photographs she'd shown him. But she was in for bad news.",
      "When Veilleux inspected the artworks closely, he declared they were prints, because paint would have permeated the paper.",
      "\u201cIt's disappointing,\" Taylor said. \u201cBut he has a lot of experience.\u201d",
      "Still, Taylor wasn't totally convinced and said she might seek a second opinion.",
      "Another seller, Jean Koenig, got better news. She brought in a large aquamarine ring. She said her father found the gem in a Brazilian mine and her grandmother had fashioned it into a ring, adding rubies and diamonds.",
      "Koenig ended up agreeing to auction the ring, with an estimated sales price of between $10,000 and $15,000. She plans to split the proceeds with her seven siblings.",
      "\u201cIt's just been sitting in a box for years,\" she said. \u201cWe decided it was time.\u201d"

      "The Australian government says it will tax large digital platforms and search engines unless they agree to share revenue with Australian news media organizations",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- The Australian government said Thursday it will tax large digital platforms and search engines unless they agree to share revenue with Australian news media organizations.",
      "The tax would apply from Jan. 1 to tech companies that earn more than 250 million Australian dollars ($160 million) a year in revenue from Australia, Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones and Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said.",
      "They include Meta, Google-owner Alphabet and ByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok.",
      "The tax would be offset through money paid to Australian media organizations. The size of the tax is not clear. But the government aims to make sharing revenue with media organizations the cheaper option.",
      "\"The real objective ... is not to raise revenue -- we hope not to raise any revenue. The real objective is to incentivize agreement-making between platforms and news media businesses in Australia,\u201d Jones told reporters.",
      "The move comes after Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, announced that it would not renew three-year deals to pay Australian news publishers for their content.",
      "A previous government introduced in 2021 laws called the News Media Bargaining Code that forced tech giants to strike revenue-sharing deals with Australian media companies or face fines of 10% of their Australian revenue.",
      "Meta said in a statement the current law was flawed and the U.S. company continued to have \u201cconcerns about charging one industry to subsidise another.\u201d",
      "\"The proposal fails to account for the realities of how our platforms work, specifically that most people don\u2019t come to our platforms for news content and that news publishers voluntarily choose to post content on our platforms because they receive value from doing so,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Google has struck revenue-sharing agreements with more than 80 Australian news companies in the past three years and has committed to renewing those deals.",
      "But Google has raised doubts about the government's new approach.",
      "\u201cThe government\u2019s introduction of a targeted tax risks the ongoing viability of commercial deals with news publishers in Australia,\u201d a Google statement said.",
      "\u201cWe are reviewing today\u2019s announcement and will have more to say once we\u2019ve assessed the full impact,\u201d Google added.",
      "TikTok noted that its users didn't seek news.",
      "\u201cAs an entertainment platform, TikTok has never been the go to place for news. We will actively engage in the consultation process and look forward to hearing more details,\u201d a TikTok statement said.",
      "Jones said Australian officials had explained the government's intentions to their counterparts in the United States, where most of the digital giants are headquartered. President-elect Donald Trump's administration is planning to increase tariffs against some countries, which has the potential to trigger trade wars.",
      "\u201cWe want to ensure that they understand the reasoning, also understand that this is not a tax in the normal sense of the word,\u201d Jones said.",
      "\u201cThis is an incentive to bolster up a law that has existed in Australia since 2021,\u201d he added.",
      "Rowland said the revenue-sharing was needed to safeguard Australian democracy.",
      "\u201cThe rapid growth of digital platforms in recent years has disrupted Australia\u2019s media landscape and it is threatening the viability of public interest journalism,\u201d Rowland said.",

      "The notice from the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office said tariffs on Chinese-made solar wafers and polysilicon will rise to 50% from 25% and duties on certain tungsten products will increase from zero to 25%, effective on Jan. 1, following a review of Chinese trade practices under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act.",
      "The decision followed a public comment period after the USTR said in September that it was considering such actions.",
      "\u201cThe tariff increases announced today will further blunt the harmful policies and practices by the People\u2019s Republic of China,\" USTR Katharine Tai said in a statement. \"These actions will complement the domestic investments made under the Biden-Harris Administration to promote a clean energy economy, while increasing the resilience of critical supply chains.\u201d",

Beijing responded by banning exports to the U.S. of certain critical minerals needed to make computer chips, such as gallium, germanium and antimony. It also stepped up its controls on graphite exports to the U.S.",
      "China provides a very large share of most of those materials and the United States has been working to secure alternative sources in Africa and other parts of the world.",
      "Tungsten is another strategically vital metal whose production is dominated by China. The U.S. does not produce it, but South Korea is a potential big supplier. It's used to make armaments and is also used in x-ray tubes and light bulb filaments, among other industrial applications. U.S. imports of the metal from China fell to $10.9 million in 2023 from $19.5 million the year before.",
      "After Beijing announced its ban on exporting gallium and the other materials to the United States, analysts said tungsten was another likely area where China might strike back.",
      "Trade frictions have been escalating ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to impose 60% tariffs on Chinese goods, among other threats. President Joe Biden has said Trump\u2019s promise of broad tariffs on foreign imports would be a mistake.",

      "The U.S. and other trading partners say China improperly subsidizes exports, giving exporters of solar panels and other products an unfair advantage in overseas markets, where its manufacturers charge lower prices thanks to government support. Washington also says China improperly pressures foreign companies to hand over technology.",
      "China accounts for more than 80% of the market for solar panels at all stages of production, according to the International Energy Agency, more than double domestic demand for those products. Its huge economies of scale have made solar power more affordable, but also concentrated the supply chain inside China. The IEA has urged other countries to assess their solar panel supply chains and develop strategies to address any risks.",
      "In early 2018, the Trump administration imposed 30% tariffs on imports of Chinese solar panels. Beijing filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization charging that the U.S. was unfairly supporting electric vehicle purchases.",
      "The investigation that led the USTR to raise the tariffs on solar panels concluded with a report in May that has prompted increases in tariffs on a range of products including electric vehicles, syringes and needles, medical gloves and facemasks, semiconductors and steel and aluminum products, among others.",

      "The text messages were disclosed as part of an ongoing lawsuit filed by Joy Banner, who along with her sister, Jo Banner, successfully led efforts to halt the $800 million grain terminal earlier this year. It would have been built within 300 feet (91 meters) of their property and close to historic sites in the predominantly Black community where they grew up.",

      "Banner initially sued the parish in federal court in December 2023 after Hotard and another parish councilman, Michael Wright, threatened her with arrest and barred her from speaking during a public comment period at a November 2023 council meeting.",
      "\u201cIn sum: a white man threatened a Black woman with prosecution and imprisonment for speaking during the public comment period of a public meeting,\u201d Banner's lawsuit says. It accuses the parish of violating Banner's First Amendment rights.",
      "Wright and his lawyer did not respond to requests for comment. Hotard and Wright have disputed Banner's version of events in court filings.",
      "At the November 2023 meeting, Banner attempted to highlight Hotard's alleged conflict of interest in approving a zoning change to enable the grain export facility's construction. Banner had also recently filed a complaint to the Louisiana Board of Ethics against Hotard pointing out that her mother-in-law allegedly would benefit financially because she owned and managed a marine transport company that had land \u201cnear and within\u201d the area being rezoned.",
      "In response to a discovery request, Hotard submitted a court filing saying \u201cno such documents exist\u201d between her and her mother-in-law discussing the property, the grain terminal or Joy Banner, according to the recent motion filed by Banner's attorneys. Hotard also said in her August deposition that she had \u201cno idea\u201d about her mother-in-law's company's land despite text messages showing Hotard and her mother-in-law had discussed this property less than three weeks before Hotard's deposition.",
      "Banner's lawsuit is scheduled to go to trial early next year.",

      "The Fulton County Sheriff's Office has promised to pay a private security company $1.4 million after some of its employees walked out of the jail in August",
      "ATLANTA -- The Fulton County Sheriff's Office said Wednesday it will send about $1.4 million in electronic payments to a private security company by the end of the week that pulled its staff from the local jail in Georgia.",
      "New York-based Strategic Security Corp. ended its contract with the county in August after it failed to pay money owed and let its officers walk out of the Fulton County Jail in the middle of the day. The company provided about 80 guards.",
      "The Sheriff's office did not pay the company what it owed in any billing cycle since the start of its contract in 2023, CEO Joseph Sordi told reporters in August. Natalie Ammons, a spokesperson for the sheriff's office, said the office did pay some bills in full.",
      "Fulton County Sheriff Patrick Labat has come under fire from county officials for failing to address dangerous conditions in the Fulton County Jail and for mismanaging funds, including the $146 million to his office allocated this year.",
      "Last year, the Fulton County Board of Commissioners dissolved the sheriff's inmate welfare fund after learning that money had been used for promotional events and consulting fees. The office said it took several remedial actions, including firing the fund administrator.",
      "In October 2023, the commission rescinded $2.1 million in funding for Georgia-based jail software company Talitrix, which was supposed to provide 1,000 wristbands and monitoring devices to the jail. Only 15 were in use. Talitrix then sued the sheriff's office over nonpayment.",
      "In Tuesday\u2019s statement, the sheriff\u2019s office said the department is underfunded by the county given its size and mandates. Underfunding has \u201cimpacted not only contractual obligations but also critical operational capacities that directly affect public safety and community trust.\"",
      "Board of Commissioners Chairman Robb Pitts released a statement in August saying that funding for the sheriff\u2019s office and jail increased 66% since 2019, but the sheriff \u201chas consistently failed to demonstrate basic budget management practices.\"",
      "Pitts said the sheriff's office signed the contract with Strategic Security Corp. to provide staffing for watchtowers in the jail without involving the county purchasing department. He said the commissioners allocated $1.3 million for 2024 based on the contract usage and with input from the sheriff's office.",
      "The office waited until August to tell county management that it had already spent more than $1 million over the budgeted amount, Pitts said.",
      "The commission passed an ordinance in July asking Labat and other constitutional officers to use the county purchasing department's procurement process when entering new contracts. Labat said he plans to sue the Board of Commissioners, which he says has gone overboard in managing how he spends money."

      "Rich Rodriguez is returning to West Virginia for a second stint as head coach at his alma mater.",
      "Athletic director Wren Baker announced the hiring on Thursday, 17 years after Rodriguez made a hasty exit for what became a disastrous three-year experiment at Michigan.",
      "\u201cWe are thrilled to welcome Coach Rich Rodriguez and his family back home,\u201d Baker said in a statement. \u201cCoach Rodriguez understands what it takes to win at West Virginia, and I believe he will pour his heart, soul and every ounce of his energy into our program. I am convinced Coach Rodriguez wants what is best for West Virginia, WVU and West Virginia football, and I am excited about the future of our program.\u201d",
      "The architect of the no-huddle, zone-read spread option offense started his coaching career as the youngest head coach in the nation at 24. He has spent his entire 30-plus year career, including 27 as a head coach, showcasing an outstanding resume. Rodriguez is a master tactician, innovator, developer of talent, program builder and a winner.",
      "Rodriguez, who is the current coach at Jacksonville State and a polarizing figure in his home state, replaces Neal Brown, who was fired on Dec. 1 after going 37-35 in six seasons, including 6-6 this year.",
      "\u201cI am thrilled to have the opportunity to be the head football coach at West Virginia University,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cMy family and I are filled with gratitude to lead the Mountaineer football program again and look forward to working with the many supporters, fans, and friends to build the best football program in America! Take Me Home!\u201d",
      "Rodriguez, 61, will be tasked with restoring a consistent winning climate at West Virginia, which hasn\u2019t been ranked or had back-to-back winning seasons since 2018. The Mountaineers have yet to qualify for the Big 12 championship game since joining the league in 2012. Its best finish was a tie for second place in 2016.",
      "Success was a standard at West Virginia under Rodriguez, who went 60-26 from 2001 to 2007 after replacing Hall of Fame coach Don Nehlen. With star players such as quarterback Pat White and running back Steve Slaton, Rodriguez led the Mountaineers to four Big East titles in five years and one of the greatest victories in school history, an upset win over Georgia in the Sugar Bowl following the 2005 season.",
      "But many in the West Virginia fanbase remain jaded over his long-ago exit.",
      "Needing a win in their 2007 regular season finale to advance to the BCS national championship game, the Mountaineers lost at home to heavy underdog Pittsburgh, 13-9.",
      "\u201cWe picked an awful time to have our worst offensive game in years,\u201d Rodriguez said after the game.",
      "Despite earning a berth in the Fiesta Bowl against Oklahoma as a consolation prize, Rodriguez was gone two weeks later, taking some of his assistant coaches and recruits with him to Michigan.",
      "Rodriguez has insisted the Pitt loss had nothing to do with him leaving. He has said promises made by the school\u2019s administration were not kept and his request for more money for his assistant coaches was rejected. Rodriguez said his relationship with then-athletic director Ed Pastilong had disintegrated by August 2007 to the point that the two men barely spoke.",
      "West Virginia went to court in an attempt to recoup Rodriguez\u2019s $4 million buyout. Eventually, Michigan paid $2.5 million and Rodriguez paid $1.5 million to settle the dispute.",
      "Things didn\u2019t go well for Rodriguez in Ann Arbor. He went 15-22 and was fired after the 2010 season. His stay at Michigan was marred by embarrassing losses and NCAA violations for exceeding limits on practice and training time at college football\u2019s winningest program.",
      "After that he went 43-35 over six years as coach at Arizona. Rodriguez was fired in January 2018 after his former administrative assistant filed a claim with the Arizona attorney general\u2019s office accusing him of sexually harassing her and creating a hostile work environment. The university said it couldn\u2019t substantiate the claims but was concerned about the \u201cdirection and climate of the football program.\u201d The lawsuit was later dismissed.",
      "Rodriguez spent one season each as offensive coordinator at Mississippi and Louisiana-Monroe and went 27-10 the past three seasons as coach at Jacksonville State, which moved from the Championship Subdivision to the FBS in 2023.",
      "Using an up-tempo, spread offense, Rodriguez has a 190-129-2 career record in 27 seasons as a head coach, including seven at Division II Glenville State.",
      "Rodriguez will be introduced on Friday at West Virginia's basketball arena, where ESPN's Pat McAfee, a former West Virginia and Indianapolis Colts kicker, will broadcast his show live.",
      "Rodriguez will get the chance to eventually break West Virginia\u2019s nine-game losing streak to ranked teams as well as calming some of that fan angst, especially when West Virginia hosts Pittsburgh. That game is set for Sept. 13 \u2014 which happens to be the inversion of 13-9.",

      "A lot has changed for the team and for the American attacking midfielder, who could be a valuable player for the United States at its home World Cup in 2026. Reyna's starting role in Wednesday's 3-2 loss to Barcelona was a sign he has a future with Dortmund, too.",
      "Reyna didn't make a big impact in his 73 minutes on the field against Barcelona but he didn't seem out of place, either. And despite the repeated injuries that have held back Reyna's club career, he seemed fit enough to keep up.",

I just have to take it and fight for more opportunities and look to really improve now.\u201d",
      "Since Reyna last started a Dortmund game on Nov. 1, 2023, he's had a largely disappointing loan at Nottingham Forest \u2014 while Dortmund reached the Champions League final without him \u2014 and a groin strain which ruled him out of the first four U.S. games under new coach Mauricio Pochettino.",

      "The problem for Dortmund is at the other end of the field.",
      "Nico Schlotterbeck's severe-looking ankle injury in the last seconds of the game left Dortmund without any fit central defenders. Losing Schlotterbeck would be a \u201ctotal meltdown,\u201d coach Sahin told broadcaster DAZN on Wednesday.",
      "Schlotterbeck was already being partnered with midfielder Emre Can in defense because Niklas S\u00fcle is ruled out for months and Waldemar Anton's return from a muscle injury remains unclear.",
      "Schlotterbeck suffered ligament damage but the club didn\u2019t give a timeframe on Thursday for his recovery, saying only it was \u201cquestionable\u201d he\u2019d play again before the new year.",

      "HOUSTON -- Golden State coach Steve Kerr said a foul call against his team that led to a loss to Houston on Wednesday night in the NBA Cup was \u201cunconscionable\u201d and that an elementary school referee wouldn\u2019t have made it.",
      "After Stephen Curry missed a 3-pointer with Golden State up a point with 11 seconds to go, Gary Payton II grabbed the offensive rebound, but turned it over with a pass that Jalen Green intercepted. Jonathan Kuminga was then called for a foul against Green while they were on the floor, giving Green a pair of free throws that lifted Houston to the 91-90 victory and a spot in the NBA Cup semifinals.",
      "\u201cThat is unconscionable,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t even understand what just happened.\u201d",
      "Kerr thought it should have either been a jump ball or the Rockets should have been given the timeout they were attempting to call.",
      "\u201cOur guys battled back, played their (expletives) off and deserved to win that game or at least have a chance for one stop at the end to finish the game,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that was taken from us by a call that I don\u2019t think an elementary school referee would have made. Because that guy would have had feel and said: \u2018You know what I\u2019m not going to decide a game on a loose ball 80 feet from the basket.\u2019\u201d",
      "Crew chief Billy Kennedy was asked by a pool reporter why the foul was called.",
      "\u201cThe defender makes contact with the neck and shoulder area, warranting a personal foul to be called,\u201d Kennedy said.",
      "Kerr ranted for about two minutes about the officiating after the game and complained about what he believed was a clear foul on Curry that wasn\u2019t called earlier.",
      "\u201cThe game was a complete wrestling match,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t call anything. Steph Curry got hit on the elbow plain as day on a jump shot, just clubbed right on there and no call. So, you\u2019ve established that you\u2019re just not going to call anything throughout the game, it\u2019s a physical game. Then you\u2019re going to call a loose ball foul on a jump ball situation with guys diving on the floor with the game on the line?\u201d",

      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and his Papua New Guinean counterpart James Marape met in Sydney to shake hands over the deal, the culmination of two years of planning. The pair reached an in-principle agreement with the NRL in May, and have since been working out specifics.",
      "\u201cA Papua New Guinea NRL team is a game-changer for Australia\u2019s relationship with PNG and a unifying force \u2014 no two countries have a greater passion for rugby league,\" Albanese said in a statement Thursday. \u201cAustralia\u2019s relationship with the Pacific is profoundly important and our sporting ties are unique.\"",
      "The final legal documents to ratify the team\u2019s creation are expected to be signed in the coming weeks.",
      "The as-yet-unnamed team is seen as key diplomatic tool for Australia to strengthen ties in the hotly-contested Pacific, particularly with China's e fforts to increase its influence in the region, and will cost Australian taxpayers 600 million Australian dollars ($380 million) over 10 years.",
      "It will be either the NRL\u2019s 18th or 19th franchise, pending further expansion plans into Perth, Western Australia.",

Recruitment of players is still two years away \u2014 league rules mean the new franchise will have to wait until November 2026 to begin approaching players on other NRL teams.",
      "\u201cThis one team will be for one people, one country, one nation, a national unifier,\" PNG leader Marape said in a statement. \u201cAn NRL team for PNG is more than just sports \u2014 it is a national unification strategy.\"",
      "Rugby league is a 13-man version of the 15-player sport of rugby union. League is played primarily in Australia, New Zealand, England and France but also is played in other countries such as the United States, Lebanon, which both have national teams, and other countries in the Pacific.",

    "published": "Thu, 12 Dec 2024 00:58:21 -0500",
    "summary": "North Carolina and Bill Belichick have agreed to a five-year deal for the six-time Super Bowl-winning head coach to become the Tar Heels&rsquo; next football coach",
    "story": [
      "North Carolina and Bill Belichick have agreed to a five-year deal for the six-time Super Bowl-winning head coach to become the Tar Heels\u2019 next football coach",
      "Bill Belichick had seemingly been waiting for the right opportunity to return to an NFL sideline. Instead, the six-time Super Bowl-winning head coach is headed to the college ranks to take over at North Carolina.",
      "The school announced it had reached a five-year deal with Belichick on Wednesday night, roughly a week after Belichick\u2019s name surfaced as an unlikely candidate to replace the program\u2019s winningest coach in Mack Brown. The deal requires approval by UNC trustees as well as the UNC public system\u2019s governors; an introductory news conference has yet to be scheduled.",
      "Moving on from the 73-year-old Brown to hire the 72-year-old Belichick means UNC is turning to a coach who has never worked at the college level, yet had incredible success in the NFL alongside quarterback Tom Brady throughout most of his 24-year tenure with the Patriots, which ended last season.",
      "There\u2019s also at least a small family tie to the UNC program for Belichick; his late father, Steve, was an assistant coach for the Tar Heels from 1953-55.",
      "\u201cI am excited for the opportunity at UNC-Chapel Hill,\u201d Belichick said in a statement. \u201cI grew up around college football with my dad and treasured those times. I have always wanted to coach in college and now I look forward to building the football program in Chapel Hill.",
      "He's arriving on campus at a time of rapid changes in college athletics, from free player movement through the transfer portal and athletes' ability to cash in on endorsements to the looming arrival of revenue sharing. Consider the Belichick hiring a novel approach by the school to rethinking how it will approach those challenges, led by someone known for success at the highest level of the sport.",
      "\u201cWe know that college athletics is changing, and those changes require new and innovative thinking,\u201d UNC athletics director Bubba Cunningham said in a statement. \u201cBill Belichick is a football legend, and hiring him to lead our program represents a new approach that will ensure Carolina football can evolve, compete and win \u2014 today and in the future.\u201d",
      "Belichick holds 333 career regular-season and postseason wins in the NFL, trailing only Don Shula\u2019s 347 for the NFL record, while his 31 playoff wins are the most in league history.",
      "He's the second coach to win a Super Bowl and then later become a college head coach; Bill Walsh won three Super Bowls with the San Francisco 49ers and later went 17-17-1 at Stanford from 1992-94.",
      "He had been linked to NFL jobs in the time since his departure from the Patriots, notably the Atlanta Falcons in January. That\u2019s why word of Belichick\u2019s conversations with UNC \u2014 first reported by Inside Carolina and confirmed by the AP last week \u2014 stirred such surprise as an unexpected and unconventional candidate.",
      "But the two sides had been in discussions for several days working on terms before finally reaching an agreement to cap what once seemed an improbable outcome.",
      "Belichick said Monday on ESPN\u2019s \u201cThe Pat McAfee Show\u201d that he\u2019d had \u201ca couple of good conversations\u201d with UNC chancellor Lee Roberts and that he\u2019d spent much of the past year taking a \u201clonger look\u201d at college football.",
      "\u201cIf I was in a college program, the college program would be a pipeline to the NFL for the players that had the ability to play in the NFL,\u201d Belichick said Monday. \u201cIt would be a professional program: training, nutrition, scheme, coaching, techniques that would transfer to the NFL.",
      "\u201cIt would be an NFL program at a college level. And an education that would get the players ready for their career after football, whether that was the end of their college career or at the end of their pro career.\"",
      "Belichick began his NFL coaching career as an assistant with the Baltimore Colts in 1975 and later worked as defensive coordinator under Bill Parcells with the New York Giants, winning two Super Bowls during that stint. He also spent five seasons as head coach of the Cleveland Browns in the first half of the 1990s.",
      "He got his second shot as a head coach in 2000 with the Patriots. And in his second year, as Brady rose to stardom, Belichick won his first Super Bowl title as a head coach.",
      "The Belichick-Brady duo went on to win the Super Bowl for the 2003, 2004, 2014, 2016 and 2018 seasons, and Belichick was The Associated Press NFL coach of the year three times.",
      "Now he takes over a UNC program that is facing a familiar challenge of how to build a sustained winner. The program had reached elite levels in moments rather than eras, notably with Brown building UNC into top-10 national stats (1996, 1997) to end his first tenure in Chapel Hill before taking over at Texas or the Tar Heels cracking the top 10 of the AP Top 25 poll briefly in 2015 and 2020.",
      "The peak of Brown's second tenure came with a nine-win season and trip to the Atlantic Coast Conference championship game in 2022 behind eventual No. 3 overall NFL draft pick Drake Maye, who was coincidentally drafted by the Patriots for their first post-Belichick year.",
      "The school announced Nov. 26 that Brown wouldn\u2019t return for a seventh season in his second stint in Chapel Hill, a firing that became effective after the program\u2019s all-time wins leader coached his finale in the Nov. 30 loss to rival N.C. State.",
      "Freddie Kitchens, himself a former Browns head coach, has been working as the interim coach as the Tar Heels prepare to face UConn in the Fenway Bowl on Dec. 28.",

      "Lake Placid would play host to bobsled, luge and skeleton events for the 2026 Olympics if a track currently being rebuilt in Italy isn't finished in time for the Milan-Cortina Games, officials said Wednesday.",
      "There has been no indication from Italian officials that the track \u2014 a century-old facility that has been dormant for nearly 20 years \u2014 won't be ready in time. Lake Placid would be serving only as a backup site, just in case.",
      "The Olympic Regional Development Authority, which manages the sliding venue in Lake Placid, said it would engage in \u201ctargeted dialogue\u201d with Italian organizers to \u201cfurther develop the Plan B back up plan for the sliding events.\"",
      "\u201cNew York State is honored to be selected, and we will work closely with Fondazione Milano Cortina to discuss the planning in a detailed manner to stage the Plan B back up plan,\u201d New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said.",
      "Lake Placid has played host to the Winter Games twice before, in 1932 and 1980. It isn't completely unprecedented for Olympic events to not take place anywhere near the Olympic city; for example, surfing at this summer's Paris Games took place in Tahiti and equestrian events at the 1956 Melbourne Games took place in Sweden.",
      "\u201cIt would create a different environment, a different Olympic experience in not being with the rest of Team USA,\u201d USA Luge CEO Scott Riewald said. \u201cBut there\u2019s nothing like competing at an Olympics on your home turf and on your home soil. And I think it presents some great opportunities for Team USA athletes and for USA Luge athletes to compete with the best in the world on a track where we\u2019ve had success.\u201d",
      "It would provide the U.S. luge, bobsled and skeleton teams with a massive advantage, since Lake Placid is their home track. American sliders tend to fare well in World Cup races in Lake Placid, and the track at Mount Van Hoevenberg will play host to the next world bobsled and skeleton championships in March.",
      "Italy\u2019s decision to rebuild the century-old track in Cortina at a cost of nearly $90 million has been met with fierce opposition by the International Olympic Committee. There were a number of other suggestions, such has holding sliding events at tracks in nearby Austria or Switzerland.",
      "The Italians insist the track will be ready. Plans are in place to have work continue throughout this winter with temporary covering at the facility to shield both the track and workers from the elements. The refrigeration system will be converted to a heating mechanism to further improve conditions for those working at the site over the winter months.",
      "But it remains unclear if sliders will be able to test the track in March as planned, and if that doesn't happen then Lake Placid could become an even more viable candidate.",
      "\u201cWe still have to go into this planning that the games are going to be in Cortina and have to take advantage of any opportunity that we have to gather information about what that will be like,\u201d Riewald said. \u201cBut yes, we will be thinking about how can we, if it does get to that point, take advantage of the fact that the games will be here in the U.S. and structure our preparations appropriately.\u201d",
      "The games will take place from Feb. 6-22, 2026.",

      "The pair had just linked up with Weah assisting McKennie for Juventus' second goal in a 2-0 win over Manchester City \u2014 marking the first time in Champions League history that two players from the United States combined for a goal.",
      "Minutes after they both came on as substitutes, McKennie started and finished the move as the midfielder gathered the ball in his own half before picking out Weah on the right. Weah\u2019s first attempt at a cross was blocked but his second was met by a spectacular McKennie scissor-kick volley from 10 yards.",
      "That sparked McKennie\u2019s traditional celebration, which he has previously said is because he is a huge Harry Potter fan. The United States midfielder even has a tattoo on his finger of a lightning bolt in tribute to the fictional young wizard.",
      "\u201cI hope I can do that celebration many more times,\u201d McKennie said.",
      "Weah\u2019s father, former FIFA Player of the Year George Weah, played briefly for City in 2000.",

      "PHILADELPHIA -- Jalen Hurts and A.J. Brown\u2019s troubles connecting on the field have yet to blow into a family feud inside the locker room \u2014 honest, both Philadelphia Eagles stars said.",
      "Between Hurts and Brown, it\u2019s all good in Philly.",
      "\u201cMe and Jalen are good,\u201d Brown said.",
      "Added Hurts, \u201cWe\u2019re good, we\u2019re good.\u201d",
      "So there will be no sit-ups in the driveway, no apologies on the front lawn, and certainly, it seems, no rift between Hurts and his No. 1 receiver.",
      "Hurts and Brown each downplayed any hint of a fissure Wednesday between the two after defensive end Brandon Graham appeared this week on a Philadelphia sports radio station and suggested there was friction between the Pro Bowl duo. The two were close friends long before they became teammates and Hurts is the godfather for Brown\u2019s daughter.",
      "Graham's comments \u2014 in which he noted \u201c things have changed,\u201d between the two, without offering specifics \u2014 exploded into tabloid and fan fodder this week in Philadelphia. His insinuations that the duo were not on the same page came on the heels of Brown's quote after a sluggish win over Carolina that the \u201c offense \u201d wasn\u2019t playing up to standard, even with the Eagles at 11-2.",
      "\u201cBG knows he spoke out of place,\u201d Hurts said.",
      "Graham, who is sidelined with a triceps injury, clarified his comments later to an ESPN reporter, saying he made the wrong assumption about the relationship between Hurts and Brown and planned to apologize to both players.",
      "Brown, with 109 yards receiving combined the last two games, said his beef with the offense wasn't directed at Hurts. It was everything from offensive coordinator Kellen Moore's play calling to execution to all the ingredients in a successful offense that make a team a Super Bowl contender.",
      "The usually pass-happy Eagles have leaned more on running back Saquon Barkley, who set the franchise season rushing record of 1,623 yards against the Panthers and is chasing Eric Dickerson for the NFL mark.",
      "\u201cObviously, it's not about running the ball,\u201d Brown told reporters. \u201cHe's about to win MVP. Clearly. What other things can we do on offense? We have to pass the ball. That can go into protection, that can go into picking up the block, that goes to us getting open quicker. Getting on the same page.\u201d",
      "Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said he never witnessed any issues between Hurts and Brown and only saw two players who worked hard together, even working on routes after practice and seemed to have a deep personal connection on and off the field.",
      "\u201cYou guys get to see three hours every Sunday where emotions can play as high as they\u2019re going to play,\u201d Sirianni said. \u201cI get to see these guys every single day, how they go about their business and interact with each other.\u201d",
      "Brown, who was coming off consecutive 1,000-yard receiving seasons, wasn't necessarily wrong in his frustration with the recent stagnation of the passing game.",
      "Hurts, who signed a contract extension ahead of the 2023 season that was worth $179.3 million guaranteed, has thrown for fewer than 200 yards in three straight games. Wide receiver DeVonta Smith \u2014 who also complained Sunday about the offense \u2014 was also coming off consecutive 1,000-yard receiving seasons but has yet to break 100 yards in a game this season. Brown has four 100-yard games, well off last season\u2019s run when he topped 100 yards in six straight games and seven times overall.",
      "Hurts has been more efficient than explosive this season but has still thrown 12 touchdown passes to just one interception \u2014 and rushed for 11 more scores \u2014 during the Eagles' nine-game winning streak that has them on the brink of clinching the NFC East.",
      "Maybe playing the Steelers on Sunday at home can snap the Eagles out of their offensive malaise. Hurts threw three TD passes to Brown in a 35-13 win in 2022.",
      "\u201cDo we all have things to get better at in the passing game? Yeah, I think that\u2019s obvious,\u201d Sirianni said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been talking about. We all have things that we\u2019ve got to get better at, coaches, players. But this is why this is the greatest team sport there is. It takes everybody. It takes every single person being together, every single person for the success to happen. It\u2019s just not a one-person thing.\u201d",

      "The Mets also agreed to provide personal team security for the All-Star outfielder and his family at the team\u2019s expense for all spring training and regular-season home and road games, according to details of the agreement obtained by The Associated Press. Major League Baseball teams usually provide security for player families in seating areas at ballparks.",

But the Mets have an option to negate that opt-out provision by increasing the yearly salaries for 2030-39 by $4 million annually to $50 million and raising the total value to $805 million. If the club does not exercise its option to negate the opt-out provision by the third day after the World Series, Soto can make his opt-out decision by the fifth day after the Series.",

We are thrilled to add him to our team and look forward to watching his excellence for years to come.\u201d",

      "\u201cThat is one this year, the facemask seems like it was the obvious one\u201d Vincent said. \u201cThat keeps showing up.\u201d",
      "Vincent also cited hits on a defenseless player, tripping, the fair catch, an illegal batted ball, an illegal double-team block, illegal formations on kickoffs and taunting as other areas that warrant consideration for replay assist.",
      "Current rules only allow replay assist to help officials pick up a flag incorrectly thrown on the field, or in assisting proper enforcement of a foul called on the field.",
      "The NFL\u2019s Competition Committee will review potential recommendations for owners to vote on for expanding replay assist.",
      "Vincent was emphatic about the league\u2019s desire to eliminate low blocks that could lead to serious injuries.",
      "\u201cThe low block below the knee needs to be removed from the game,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cYou look at high school, you look at college, too. Every block should be above the knee, but below the neck. All the work that we\u2019ve done for the head and neck area, all the things that we\u2019ve taken out of the game, this is the right time for us to remove the low block out of the game. Be consistent with high school. Be consistent with college. Every block should be above the knee and below the neck.\u201d",
      "The league will consider changes to the onside kick after dramatically overhauling the kickoff rule on a one-year basis.",
      "\u201cWe need to look at that. That\u2019s a dead play,\u201d Vincent said of the onside kick\u2019s low success rate. \u201cThat is a ceremonial play. Very low recovery rate. When we look at the kickoff and maybe where the touchback area should be during the offseason, we need to revisit the onside kick.\u201d",
      "Options include giving the team an opportunity to run one play to gain a certain number of yards to keep possession.",
      "The Washington Commanders\u2019 search for a new stadium site includes options in Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia, and work has escalated on one in particular.",
      "NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and controlling owner Josh Harris met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill last week about the RFK Stadium site in Washington, which requires a bill getting through Congress to transfer the land to the District government before anything else can happen.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a bipartisan support for this,\u201d Goodell said, adding he\u2019d like to see it get to a vote soon. \u201cWe hope that it will be addressed and approved so that it\u2019s at least an alternative for the Commanders if we go forward. I grew up in Washington, and I know would be exciting for a lot of fans.\u201d",
      "The NFL continues to discuss a potential 18-game season, but would need approval from the players\u2019 union.",
      "\u201cWe are doing analysis I would say, but we are not finalizing any plans at this point,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cThey\u2019ll share that analysis with the players\u2019 union, which would need to agree to any change.\u201d",

      "The global chemical weapons watchdog has opened an emergency meeting to discuss the situation in Syria over concerns about the country\u2019s stockpile of toxic chemicals in the wake of the overthrow of President Bashar Assad",
      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The global chemical weapons watchdog opened an emergency meeting on Thursday to discuss the situation in Syria over concerns about the country\u2019s stockpile of toxic chemicals in the wake of the overthrow of President Bashar Assad.",
      "The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons on Monday told Syria that it is under obligations to comply with rules to safeguard and destroy dangerous substances, such as chlorine gas, after rebels entered the capital, Damascus, over the weekend.",
      "\u201cChemical weapons have been used in Syria on multiple occasions and victims deserve that perpetrators that we identified be brought to justice and held accountable for what they did and that investigations continue,\u201d Fernando Arias Gonz\u00e1lez, the OPCW secretary general, said in his opening remarks.",
      "\u201cOur reports over the past few years have reached very clear conclusions and we hope that the new circumstances in Syria will allow this chapter to be closed soon,\u201d he added, referring to the lack of stockpile declarations and the use of the weapons themselves.",
      "Assad\u2019s government has denied using chemical weapons but the OPCW found evidence indicating their repeated use by Syria in the grinding civil war. Earlier this year, the organization found the Islamic State group had used mustard gas against the town of Marea.",
      "In a rare move, the OPCW's executive council called the meeting, hoping that under a new government, some of its 80 inspectors may be allowed to pursue investigations into Syria's chemical weapons program.",
      "Members of the ousted Syrian government plan to gradually transfer power to a new transitional Cabinet headed by Mohammed al-Bashir, who reportedly headed the rebel alliance\u2019s \u201csalvation government\u201d in its southwest Syrian stronghold.",
      "Arias Gonz\u00e1lez also expressed concern about ongoing Israeli airstrikes in Syria.",
      "\u201cWe do not know yet whether these strikes have affected chemical weapons related sites. Such airstrikes could create a risk of contamination. Another real risk would be the destruction of valuable evidence for investigations by different independent international bodies related to past use of chemical weapons,\u201d the Spanish diplomat said.",
      "The last time the OPCW called an extraordinary meeting was in 2018, in response to the chemical attack on Douma, a town close to Damascus, when some 40 people were killed by poison gas. Last year the watchdog found that the Syrian Armed Forces dropped canisters of chlorine gas during a major military operation.",
      "Syria joined the OPCW in 2013 to ward off the threat of airstrikes in response to a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus.",
      "The OPCW\u2019s 193 member states are required to disclose their chemical weapons programs and dismantle them. The organization, created in 1997 by the Chemical Weapons Convention, seeks to eliminate all chemical weapons. In 2013, it was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for its work."

      "The donation comes just weeks after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg met with Trump privately at Mar-a-Lago. A Meta spokesperson confirmed the offering Thursday. The news was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.",
      "Stephen Miller, who has been appointed deputy chief of staff for Trump\u2019s second term, has said that Zuckerberg, like other business leaders, wants to support Trump\u2019s economic plans. The tech CEO has been seeking to change his company\u2019s perception on the right following a rocky relationship with Trump.",
      "Trump was kicked off Facebook following the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. The company restored his account in early 2023.",
      "During the 2024 campaign, Zuckerberg did not endorse a candidate for president but has voiced a more positive stance toward Trump. Earlier this year, he praised Trump\u2019s response to his first assassination attempt.",
      "Still, Trump had continued to attack Zuckerberg publicly during the campaign. In July, he posted a message on his own social network Truth Social threatening to send election fraudsters to prison in part by citing a nickname he used for the Meta CEO. \u201cZUCKERBUCKS, be careful!\u201d Trump wrote.",
      "Corporations have traditionally made up a large share of donors to presidential inaugurals, with an exception in 2009, when then-President-elect Barack Obama refused to accept corporate donations. He reversed course for his second inaugural in 2013.",

      "DoorDash will require its drivers to verify their identity more often as part of a larger effort to crack down on unauthorized account sharing.",
      "DoorDash has been under pressure to ensure its drivers are operating legally. Over the summer, it pledged to do a better job identifying and removing dangerous drivers after a flood of complaints of dangerous driving from cities. Officials in Boston, New York and other cities have said that in many cases, people with multiple traffic violations continue making deliveries using accounts registered to others.",
      "The San Francisco delivery company said Thursday it has begun requiring some drivers to complete real-time identity checks immediately after they complete a delivery. Previously, drivers were occasionally asked to re-verify their identity before or after a shift. The new system has been introduced in Los Angeles, Denver, Seattle and other cities and will roll out more widely next year.",
      "DoorDash said it has also developed an advanced machine learning system that can flag potential unauthorized account access, including login anomalies and suspicious activity. If the company detects a problem it will require the driver to re-verify their identity before they can make more deliveries.",
      "Before U.S. drivers can make DoorDash deliveries, they must verify their identity with a driver\u2019s license or other government-issued identification and upload a selfie that matches their identification photo. They also must submit to a background check, which requires a Social Security number.",
      "But the company has found that some drivers are getting around those requirements by sharing accounts with authorized users. In some cases, drivers who haven\u2019t been authorized to drive for DoorDash are paying authorized users for access to their accounts.",
      "Some federal lawmakers have also demanded that DoorDash and other delivery apps do a better job of keeping illegal immigrants off their platforms. Republican U.S. Sens. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Mike Braun of Indiana and Ted Budd of North Carolina sent letters to delivery companies in April asking them to crack down on account sharing.",
      "\u201cThese illegal immigrants are delivering food directly to consumers\u2019 doors without ever having undergone a background check and often without even using their real names,\u201d the letter said. It added that working illegally can also be dangerous for migrants, creating the potential for exploitation and abuse.",
      "DoorDash won\u2019t estimate how many drivers are using shared accounts, but said its safeguards are effective. Last year, it began asking drivers to re-verify their identities monthly by submitting a selfie. The company said it is now asking more than 150,000 drivers to complete selfie checks each week, and it\u2019s removing them from the platform if they don\u2019t comply."

    "story": [
      "The Biden administration has announced it is raising tariffs on solar wafers, polysilicon and some tungsten products from China to protect U.S. clean energy businesses",
      "BANGKOK -- The Biden administration plans to raise tariffs on solar wafers, polysilicon and some tungsten products from China to protect U.S. clean energy businesses.",
      "The notice from the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office said tariffs on Chinese-made solar wafers and polysilicon will rise to 50% from 25% and duties on certain tungsten products will increase from zero to 25%, effective on Jan. 1, following a review of Chinese trade practices under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act.",
      "The decision followed a public comment period after the USTR said in September that it was considering such actions.",
      "\u201cThe tariff increases announced today will further blunt the harmful policies and practices by the People\u2019s Republic of China,\" USTR Katharine Tai said in a statement. \"These actions will complement the domestic investments made under the Biden-Harris Administration to promote a clean energy economy, while increasing the resilience of critical supply chains.\u201d",
      "Reports Thursday said U.S. and Chinese officials were meeting this week and next for trade talks ahead of the year's end.",
      "China's Commerce Ministry took aim Thursday at the approval by the House of Representatives of a defense spending bill that includes $3 billion in funding for removal from U.S. networks of telecoms equipment provided by Chinese firms, including Huawei and ZTE.",
      "\u201cThe United States\u2019 claim that Chinese information and communication products pose security risks is completely baseless,\" ministry spokesperson He Yadong told reporters at a routine briefing. \"We hope that the U.S. will respect facts and stop politicizing and weaponizing economic and trade issues. China will take all necessary measures to firmly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises,\u201d He said without elaborating.",
      "Last week, Washington tightened restrictions on Chinese access to advanced semiconductor technology. Beijing responded by banning exports to the U.S. of certain critical minerals needed to make computer chips, such as gallium, germanium and antimony. It also stepped up its controls on graphite exports to the U.S.",
      "China provides a very large share of most of those materials and the United States has been working to secure alternative sources in Africa and other parts of the world.",
      "Tungsten is another strategically vital metal whose production is dominated by China. The U.S. does not produce it, but South Korea is a potential big supplier. It's used to make armaments and is also used in x-ray tubes and light bulb filaments, among other industrial applications. U.S. imports of the metal from China fell to $10.9 million in 2023 from $19.5 million the year before.",
      "After Beijing announced its ban on exporting gallium and the other materials to the United States, analysts said tungsten was another likely area where China might strike back.",
      "Trade frictions have been escalating ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to impose 60% tariffs on Chinese goods, among other threats. President Joe Biden has said Trump\u2019s promise of broad tariffs on foreign imports would be a mistake.",
      "His administration has kept in place tariffs that Trump imposed during his first term in office, but says it has a more targeted approach.",
      "China has sharply ramped up production of cheap electric vehicles, solar panels, and batteries at a time when the Biden administration has championed moves to support those industries in the U.S.",
      "The U.S. and other trading partners say China improperly subsidizes exports, giving exporters of solar panels and other products an unfair advantage in overseas markets, where its manufacturers charge lower prices thanks to government support. Washington also says China improperly pressures foreign companies to hand over technology.",
      "China accounts for more than 80% of the market for solar panels at all stages of production, according to the International Energy Agency, more than double domestic demand for those products. Its huge economies of scale have made solar power more affordable, but also concentrated the supply chain inside China. The IEA has urged other countries to assess their solar panel supply chains and develop strategies to address any risks.",
      "In early 2018, the Trump administration imposed 30% tariffs on imports of Chinese solar panels. Beijing filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization charging that the U.S. was unfairly supporting electric vehicle purchases.",
      "The investigation that led the USTR to raise the tariffs on solar panels concluded with a report in May that has prompted increases in tariffs on a range of products including electric vehicles, syringes and needles, medical gloves and facemasks, semiconductors and steel and aluminum products, among others.",
      "It has pushed tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles up to 100% from 25%, raised tariffs on Chinese-made lithium batteries to 25% from 7.5%."

      "Cyber officials are advising people to use encryption in their communications after a sprawling hacking campaign",
      "LONDON -- After a sprawling hacking campaign exposed the communications of an unknown number of Americans, U.S. cybersecurity officials are advising people to use encryption in their communications.",
      "To safeguard against the risks highlighted by the campaign, which originated in China, federal cybersecurity authorities released an extensive list of security recommendations for U.S. telecom companies \u2014 such as Verizon and AT&T \u2014 that were targeted. The advice includes one tip we can all put into practice with our phones: \u201cEnsure that traffic is end-to-end encrypted to the maximum extent possible.\u201d",
      "End-to-end encryption, also known as E2EE, means that messages are scrambled so that only the sender and recipient can see them. If anyone else intercepts the message, all they will see is a garble that can't be unscrambled without the key.",
      "Law enforcement officials had until now resisted this type of encryption because it means the technology companies themselves won't be able to look at the messages, nor respond to law enforcement requests to turn the data over.",
      "Here's a look at various ways ordinary consumers can use end-to-end encryption:",
      "Officials said the hackers targeted the metadata of a large number of customers, including information on the dates, times and recipients of calls and texts. They also managed to see the content from texts from a much smaller number of victims.",
      "If you're an iPhone user, information in text messages that you send to someone else who also has an iPhone will be encrypted end-to-end. Just look for the blue text bubbles, which indicate that they are encrypted iMessages.",
      "The same goes for Android users sending texts through Google Messages. There will be a lock next to the timestamp on each message to indicate the encryption is on.",
      "But there's a weakness. When iPhone and Android users text each other, the messages are encrypted only using Rich Communication Services, an industry standard for instant messaging that replaces the older SMS and MMS standards.",
      "Apple has noted that RCS messages \u201caren\u2019t end-to-end encrypted, which means they\u2019re not protected from a third party reading them while they\u2019re sent between devices.\u201d",
      "Samsung, which sells Android smartphones, has also hinted at the issue in a footnote at the bottom of a press release last month on RCS, saying, \u201cEncryption only available for Android to Android communication.\u201d",
      "To avoid getting caught out when trading texts, experts recommend using encrypted messaging apps.",
      "Privacy advocates are big fans of Signal, which applies end-to-end encryption on all messages and voice calls. The independent nonprofit group behind the app promises never to sell, rent, or lease customer data and has made its source code publicly available so that it can be audited by anyone to examine it \u201cfor security and correctness.\u201d",
      "Signal's encryption protocol is so reputable that it has been integrated into rival WhatsApp, so users will enjoy the same level of security protection as Signal, which has a much smaller user base. End-to-end encryption is also the default mode for Facebook Messenger, which like WhatsApp is owned by Meta Platforms.",
      "Telegram is an app that can be used for one-on-one conversations, group chats and broadcast \u201cchannels\" but contrary to popular perception, it doesn't turn on end-to-end encryption by default. Users have to switch on the option. And it doesn\u2019t work with group chats.",
      "Cybersecurity experts have warned people against using Telegram for private communications and pointed out that only its opt-in \u2018secret chat\u2019 feature is encrypted from end-to-end. The app also has a reputation for being a haven for scammers and criminal activity, highlighted by founder and CEO Pavel Durov's arrest in France.",
      "Instead of using your phone to make calls through a wireless cellular network, you can make voice calls with Signal and WhatsApp. Both apps encrypt calls with the same technology that they use to encrypt messages.",
      "There are other options. If you have an iPhone you can use Facetime for calls, while Android owners can use the Google Fi service, which are both end-to-end encrypted.",
      "The only catch with all these options is that, as with using the chat services to send messages, the person on the other end will also have to have the app installed.",
      "WhatsApp and Signal users can customize their privacy preferences in the settings, including hiding IP address during calls to prevent your general location from being guessed.",

      "The Wednesday release of the iPhone's upgraded operating system, iOS 18.2, extends Apple's expansion into AI months after rivals such as Samsung and Google began implanting the revolutionary technology on their devices. The update builds upon another one that came out in late October to usher in the AI era for Apple and the iPhone, as well as for the iPad and Mac.",
      "The latest round of AI tricks includes \u201cGenmojis,\u201d Apple's description for emojis that iPhone users will be able to ask the technology to create and then share. Apple says it is placing some limits its AI's emoji artistry to prevent the distribution of violent or hateful imagery. Other features include an \u201cImage Playground\u201d for a variety of AI-styled illustrations, writing tools and options for summarizing emails.",
      "The technology won\u2019t work on iPhones that Apple made before 2023 because it requires a special processor that isn\u2019t in older models. The AI will work on the iPhone 16 line-up that came out in September and the premium iPhone 15 models released last year.",
      "That exclusivity is expected to propel a cycle of iPhone upgrades during the current holiday shopping season into next year, driving up Apple's profit even higher from the $94 billion that the Cupertino, California, company pocketed in its last fiscal year ending in September. That expectation is the main reason Apple's stock price has climbed by about 30% so far this year to push the company's market value closer to the $4 trillion threshold for the first time.",
      "Apple is broadening the AI suite's appeal by including English versions tailored for Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, and the U.K. that are included in the latest software update.",
      "Although the iPhone's AI is similar to many of the features that have already been available from other companies, Apple is taking a slightly different approach to the technology in an effort to stand out from the rest of pack. It is emphasizing its ongoing commitment to protecting iPhone users' privacy by processing most of its AI on the device itself or corralling it in a secured data center. Users seeking more AI wizardry than the device or the special data center can handle will have the option to reach out to the popular ChatGPT technology made by OpenAI, which has forged a partnership with Apple."

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Google on Wednesday unleashed another wave of artificial intelligence designed to tackle more of the work and thinking done by humans as it tries to stay on the technology's cutting edge while also trying to fend off regulatory threats to its empire.",
      "The next generation of Google's AI is being packaged under the Gemini umbrella, which was unveiled a year ago. Google is framing its release of Gemini 2.0 as a springboard for AI agents built to interpret images shown through a smartphone, perform a variety of tedious chores, remember the conversations consumers have with people, help video game players plot strategy and even tackle the task of doing online searches.",
      "In a blog post, Google CEO Sundar Pichai predicted the technology contained in Gemini 2.0 will \u201cunderstand more about the world around you, think multiple steps ahead and take action on your behalf, with your supervision.\u201d It's a similar goal being pursued by hard-charging rivals such as OpenAI, with its chatGPT technology, and industry powerhouse such as Microsoft with a variety of similar tools on its Windows software.",
      "A lot of Google's latest AI technology will initially be confined to test groups and subscribers who pay $20 per month for Gemini Advanced, but some features will be made available through its search engine and mobile apps. Google is planning wider releases next year that will include the technology popping up in its smorgasbord of free products, including its Chrome browser, digital maps and YouTube.",
      "Besides trying to outshine OpenAI and other ambitious startups, Google is also trying to stay a step ahead of Apple as that trendsetting company begins to blend AI into its latest iPhones and other devices. After releasing a software update enabling the first bundle of the iPhone's \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d features that spruced up the device's Siri assistant, another batch of the AI technology came out with a free software update that was also released Wednesday.",
      "Google is pushing forward with its latest AI advances even as the U.S. Justice Department is trying to break up the Mountain View, California, company to prevent further abusive practices by its dominant search engine, which was declared an illegal monopoly by a federal judge earlier this year as part of a landmark antitrust case.",
      "Among other things, Gemini 2.0 is supposed to improve the AI overviews that Google began highlighting in its search results over its traditional listing of the most pertinent links to websites earlier this year in response to AI-powered \u201canswer engines\u201d such as Perplexity.",
      "After the AI overviews initially produced some goofy suggestions, including putting glue on pizza, Google refined the technology to minimize such missteps. Now, company executives are promising things are going to get even better with Gemini 2.0, which Pichai said will be able to engage in more human-like reasoning while solving more advanced math problems and even churn out some computer code. The improvements to AI Overviews will initially only appear to a test audience before a wider release next year.",
      "The technological upgrade is also supposed to infuse a still-experimental universal AI agent dubbed \u201cProject Astra,\u201d with even more smarts and versatility, enabling people to have more meaningful and helpful conversations with the technology. In a show of confidence, Google said it will expand the number of people testing Project Astra without providing any specifics of the group's size.",

      "If the U.S. Department of Justice gets its way, Google will be forced to sell or spin off Chrome as part of its punishment for deploying its search engine in ways that stifled competition and potential innovation.

      "The Geminids \u2014 among the few major meteor showers to come from asteroids \u2014 peak on Friday. It's one of the year's last chances to see fireballs in the sky.",
      "The shower often produces meteors with a distinctly more yellow glow, likely due to the unusual origin material, said Sally Brummel, planetarium manager at the University of Minnesota\u2019s Bell Museum.",
      "Under ideal viewing conditions, the Geminids typically put on one of the best and brightest shows of the year because of the high volume of meteors visible each hour. However, an almost full moon this year means up to 15 meteors per hour are expected at peak time, according to the American Meteor Society.",
      "The moonlight \u201cwill wash out a lot of them,\" Brummel said.",
      "Viewing lasts until Dec. 21. Here\u2019s what to know about the Geminids and other meteor showers.",
      "Multiple meteor showers occur annually and you don\u2019t need special equipment to see them.",
      "Most meteor showers originate from the debris of comets, but a few \u2014 including the Geminids \u2014 result from the debris of asteroids. The Geminids come from the sun-orbiting asteroid 3200 Phaethon.",
      "When rocks from space enter Earth\u2019s atmosphere, the resistance from the air makes them very hot. This causes the air to glow around them and briefly leaves a fiery tail behind them \u2014 the end of a \u201cshooting star.\u201d",
      "The glowing pockets of air around fast-moving space rocks, ranging from the size of a dust particle to a boulder, may be visible in the night sky.",
      "The rocky nature of asteroid debris makes the Geminids especially likely to produce fireballs, said NASA's William Cooke. \u201cThose are pretty tough rocks that can penetrate deep into the atmosphere,\u201d he said.",
      "Meteor showers are usually most visible between midnight and predawn hours.",
      "It\u2019s easier to see shooting stars under dark skies, away from city lights. Meteor showers also appear brightest on cloudless nights when the moon wanes smallest.",
      "And your eyes will better adapted to seeing meteors if you aren\u2019t checking your phone.",
      "The next meteor shower, the Ursids, will peak on Dec. 22.",

      "The government is not blocking access to the TikTok app, which will continue to be available to Canadians. TikTok said it has 14 million users in Canada, which is about a third of the population. It has offices in Toronto and Vancouver.",
      "The wildly popular platform is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company that moved its headquarters to Singapore in 2020, but is under increasing pressure in the West. It's facing a possible ban in the U.S. and intensifying scrutiny in Europe over issues including election influence campaigns allegedly coordinated by Moscow.",
      "TikTok argues in its court application, which was posted online, that Industry Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne's decision was \u201cunreasonable\u201d and \u201cdriven by improper purposes.\u201d It says the order is \u201cgrossly disproportionate\u201d and the the national security review was \u201cprocedurally unfair.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Lawyers in the Alex Jones bankruptcy case are now in discussions on what could happen next after a federal judge in Texas rejected the auction sale of Jones\u2019 Infowars to The Onion satirical news outlet",
      "The Onion's rejected purchase of Infowars in an auction bid supported by families of the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting dealt them a new setback Wednesday and clouded the future of Alex Jones' conspiracy theory platform, which will remain in his control for at least the near future.",
      "What's next for Infowars and the Sandy Hook families' long-sought efforts to hold Jones accountable over calling one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history a hoax was unclear, after a federal judge in Houston late Tuesday rejected The Onion's winning bid for the site. The only other bidder was a company aligned with Jones.",
      "U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez in Houston said he did not want another auction but offered no roadmap over how to proceed. One possibility includes ultimately allowing Sandy Hook families \u2014 who comprise most of Jones' creditors \u2014 to return to state courts in Connecticut and Texas to collect on the nearly $1.5 billion in defamation and emotional distress lawsuit judgments that Jones was ordered to pay them.",
      "\u201cOur hope is that when this process ends, and it will end, and it will end sooner rather than later, is that all assets that Alex Jones has available are paid to the families, and that includes Infowars, and that as a result of that process Alex Jones is deprived of the ownership and control of the platform that he\u2019s used to hurt so many people,\u201d Christopher Mattei, an attorney for the Sandy Hook families, said Wednesday.",
      "The families, meanwhile, were preparing to mark the 12th anniversary of the Dec. 14 shooting.",
      "The sale of Infowars is part of Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022 after he was ordered to pay the $1.5 billion. Jones was sued for repeatedly saying on his show that the 2012 massacre of 20 first graders and six educators was staged by crisis actors to spur more gun control.",
      "He has since conceded that the shooting did happen.",
      "Lopez said there was a lack of transparency in the bidding process and too much confusion about The Onion's bid, and he expressed concern that the amount of money offered was too low.",
      "The Onion's parent company, Global Tetrahedron, submitted a $1.75 million cash offer with plans to kick Jones out and relaunch Infowars in January as a parody. The bid also included a deal with many of the Sandy Hook families for them to forgo $750,000 of their auction proceeds and give it to other creditors.",
      "The other bidder was First United American Companies, which runs a website in Jones\u2019 name that sells nutritional supplements and planned to let Jones stay on the Infowars platforms. It offered $3.5 million in cash and later, with Jones, alleged fraud and collusion in the bidding process. Lopez rejected those allegations.",
      "Christopher Murray, the trustee who oversaw the auction, said he picked The Onion and its deal with the Sandy Hook families because it would have provided more money to Jones' other creditors.",
      "Lopez directed Murray to come up with a new plan to move forward. Murray and representatives of The Onion did not immediately return messages seeking comment.",
      "The judge said there was a possibility there could be a trial in 2025 to settle Jones' bankruptcy and that Murray could try to sell the equity in Infowars' parent company.",
      "The judge said he wanted to hear back from Murray and others involved in the bankruptcy within 30 days on a plan.",
      "On the social media platform X, Jones called the judge's ruling a \u201cMajor Victory For Freedom Of The Press & Due Process.\"",
      "Jeff Anapolsky, an adjunct professor at the University of Houston Law Center and the managing director and founder of Anapolsky Advisors, a financial consulting firm, said he was not surprised Lopez rejected the sale. He was not involved in the case but said he has appeared before Lopez and described him as a fair judge.",
      "Anapolsky believes the sale of the Infowars assets will ultimately take place and be approved.",
      "\u201cSo that\u2019s up to Mr. Murray now, the trustee, to go do something to make everybody feel like everybody had their say and understand the transparency of the process,\u201d Anapolsky said.",
      "The decision came during a solemn week for relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. The 12th anniversary is Saturday, and some of the victims' relatives were traveling to Washington, D.C., to attend an annual vigil for victims of gun violence. The families usually mark the anniversary out of the public eye.",
      "Many of the families have said their lawsuits against Jones bought back the unbearable pain of losing their loved ones, as well as the trauma of being harassed and threatened by believers of Jones' hoax conspiracy. Relatives said they have been confronted in public by hoax believers and received death and rape threats.",
      "The families have not received any money from Jones since winning the trials.",

      "Regional supermarket chain Stop & Shop is installing kiosks in all of its stores in the Northeast U.S. to make digital-only coupons more accessible",
      "Regional supermarket chain Stop & Shop said Wednesday that it would install kiosks in all of its U.S. stores to make digital-only coupons more accessible to customers.",
      "Stop & Shop, which operates in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey and Rhode Island, said the kiosks will let customers scan a loyalty card or enter a phone number and quickly get access to any digital coupons or personalized offers.",
      "The kiosks, known as Savings Stations, are expected to be installed in all 365 Stop & Shop locations by early January, the company said.",
      "Digital-only deals are advertised online or on store shelves. They can offer significant savings but generally require customers to electronically clip a coupon located in a grocer\u2019s app or on its website.",
      "In 2022, a coalition of consumer groups sent letters to a dozen supermarket chains, including Kroger and Stop & Shop, urging them to make sure deals are available in both digital and non-digital formats.",
      "The groups, which included Consumer Reports, Consumer Action, the Public Interest Research Group and the National Consumers League, said many shoppers may lack smartphones, internet access or the technical savvy to figure out how digital-only coupons work.",
      "Smartphone access varies widely by age group in the U.S., according to a 2021 study by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center. The study found that 96% of people ages 18 to 29 own a smartphone, compared to 61% of those 65 and older. The same study found that 25% of people 65 or older don\u2019t use the internet.",
      "Consumer World founder Edgar Dworsky said Wednesday that Stop & Shop was the first chain to respond to the group\u2019s request. Dworsky said the kiosks would help customers who have been shut out of deals previously. But he also thinks they will help regular app users, since they give shoppers access to all of a store\u2019s deals at once.",
      "Stop & Shop said it started piloting the Savings Station late last year. The kiosk give shoppers a printout of the digital coupons loaded onto their loyalty cards if they want to reference them while shopping.",
      "Stop & Shop President Roger Wheeler said the chain was hearing from customers who felt they were missing out on deals.",
      "\u201cIt ensures that our customers can easily access all of our great deals, especially during the holiday season when savings are top of mind,\u201d Wheeler said in a statement."

      "DETROIT -- General Motors said Tuesday it will retreat from the robotaxi business and stop funding its money-losing Cruise autonomous vehicle unit.",
      "Instead the Detroit automaker will focus on development of partially automated driver-assist systems for personal vehicles like its Super Cruise, which allows drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel.",
      "GM said it would get out of robotaxis \u201cgiven the considerable time and resources that would be needed to scale the business, along with an increasingly competitive robotaxi market.\u201d",

      "Over the years GM invested billions in the subsidiary and eventually bought 90% of the company from investors, all while racking up millions in losses.",
      "GM\u2019s brushoff of Cruise represents a dramatic about-face from years of full-blown support that left a huge financial dent in the automaker. The company invested $2.4 billion in Cruise only to sustain years of uninterrupted losses, with little in return. Since GM bought a controlling stake in Cruise for $581 million in 2016, the robotaxi service piled up more than $10 billion in operating losses while bringing in less than $500 million in revenue, according to GM shareholder reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "The automaker even announced plans for Cruise to generate $1 billion in annual revenue by 2025, but it scaled back spending on the company after one of its autonomous Chevrolet Bolts dragged a San Francisco pedestrian who was hit by another vehicle in 2023.",
      "The California Public Utilities Commission alleged Cruise then covered up details of the crash for more than two weeks.",
      "The embarrassing incident resulted in Cruise\u2019s license to operate its driverless fleet in California being suspended by regulators and triggered a purge of its leadership \u2014 in addition to layoffs that jettisoned about a quarter of its workforce.",

      "At the time the company said it didn\u2019t see a path to profitability for a number of years.",
      "Yet other companies are pressing forward with plans to deploy autonomous vehicles and expanding their services.",
      "Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo is accelerating plans to broaden its robotaxi service beyond areas of metropolitan Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Last week the company said it would begin testing its driverless Jaguars in Miami next year, with plans to start charging for rides in 2026.",
      "The move comes less than a month after Waymo opened up its robotaxi service to anyone looking for a ride in an 80-square-mile (129 square kilometer) area of Los Angeles. Waymo also has plans to launch fleets in Atlanta and Austin next year in partership with ride-hailing leader Uber.",
      "In April, a company called Aurora Innovation plans to start hauling freight on Texas freeways using fully driverless semis.",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said his company plans to have autonomous Models Y and 3 running without human drivers next year. Robotaxis without steering wheels using Tesla's \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system would be available in 2026 starting in California and Texas, he said.",
      "But an investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration into Full Self-Driving's ability to see in low visibility conditions cast doubt on whether Teslas are ready to be deployed without humans behind the wheel.",
      "The agency began the investigation in October after getting reports of four crashes involving \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d when Teslas encountered sun glare, fog and airborne dust. An Arizona pedestrian was killed in one of the crashes.",

      "Cruise has about 2,300 employees and will retain a presence in San Francisco, GM said. It\u2019s too early to talk about employment levels until the restructuring is completed next year, a spokesman said.",
      "Dave Richardson, senior vice president of software and services engineering, said Cruise will bring its software, artificial intelligence and sensor development to GM to team up on improving GM\u2019s driver-assist systems.",

      "Back in 2022, Epic agreed to pay a total of $520 million to settle complaints revolving around children\u2019s privacy and payment methods on its popular Fortnite game. The FTC alleged the video game giant used deceptive online design tactics to trick Fortnite players, including children, into making unintended purchases \u201cbased on the press of a single button.\"",
      "Consumers could be charged while doing something as simple as attempting the wake the game from sleep mode, for example, or by pressing a nearby button when trying to preview an item, the agency said. The FTC also accused Epic of blocking some users who disputed the charges from accessing the content they purchased.",
      "Beyond a $275 million fine related to collecting personal information on players under the age of 13, the settlement included $245 million in customer refunds. Now, the first batch of those refunds are being sent out.",

      "The Israeli ground-based system is capable of simultaneously intercepting missiles, drones and aircraft from as far as 93 miles (150 kilometers) away, and represents a significant upgrade to Cyprus' defense shield, which had until recently only consisted of Soviet-era weapons, such as the BUK M1-2 missile system.",
      "Cyprus in recent years pivoted away from Russian weapons systems as part of a broader, pro-Western strategy to bring the small nation's armed forces up to EU and NATO standards. The Cypriot president, Nikos Christodoulides, said earlier this month that Cyprus could apply to join NATO with U.S. help, once conditions allow for it.",
      "Palmas said closer diplomatic and military ties with the United States have enabled Cyprus to leverage its geographic location as the closest European Union member to the Mideast to expand its diplomatic outreach in regional peace efforts and help in providing humanitarian assistance.",
      "Earlier this year, some 20,000 tons of humanitarian aid was shipped directly to Gaza via a maritime corridor from Cyprus. That effort halted as fighting intensified but efforts are underway to reestablish the supply route, this time via the Israeli port of Ashdod.",
      "The closer ties with the U.S. in recent years culminated in the lifting of a decades-old arms embargo Washington imposed on ethnically divided Cyprus to prevent an arms race.",
      "Cyprus\u2019 split came in 1974 when Turkey invaded after a coup on the island aiming at uniting it with Greece. Turkey continues to maintain more than 35,000 troops in the island\u2019s breakaway, Turkish Cypriot north.",
      "Following the lifting of the U.S. arms embargo, Cyprus\u2019 elite underwater demolition teams have reportedly been recently supplied with modern, U.S.-made M5 carbines \u2014 rifles more suited for special warfare teams.",
      "Palmas also told the AP that work is underway to enlarge Cyprus' air base in the island\u2019s southwest, including a longer runway.",
      "A major upgrade is also in the pipeline, he said, for the Mari naval base on the southern coast, also significantly expanding its facilities to accommodate warships and submarines of allied and friendly countries."

    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 01:14:31 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal judge has rejected the sale of the conspiracy platform Infowars to The Onion satirical news outlet after Alex Jones claimed that a recent bankruptcy auction was fraught with illegal collusion",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge has rejected the sale of the conspiracy platform Infowars to The Onion satirical news outlet after Alex Jones claimed that a recent bankruptcy auction was fraught with illegal collusion",
      "A federal judge on Tuesday night rejected the auction sale of Alex Jones\u2019 Infowars to The Onion satirical news outlet, criticizing the bidding process as flawed and the amount of money that families of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary shooting stood to receive.",
      "The Onion had been named the winning bidder on Nov. 14 over a company affiliated with Jones, whose conspiracy theory platform was put up for sale as part of his bankruptcy case stemming from the nearly $1.5 billion that courts have ordered him to pay over falsely calling one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history a hoax.",
      "The decision by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez of Houston to not approve the sale means Jones can stay at his Infowars headquarters in Austin, Texas. The Onion had planned to kick Jones out and relaunch Infowars in January as a parody.",
      "\u201cWe are deeply disappointed in today's decision, but The Onion will continue to seek a resolution that helps the Sandy Hook families receive a positive outcome for the horror they endured,\u201d Ben Collins, CEO of The Onion\u2019s parent company, Global Tetrahedron, posted on social media late Tuesday.",
      "Lopez cited problems \u2014 but no wrongdoing \u2014 with the auction process. He said he did not want another auction and left it up to the trustee who oversaw the auction to determine the next steps.",
      "The Onion offered $1.75 million in cash and other incentives for Infowars\u2019 assets in the auction. First United American Companies, which runs a website in Jones\u2019 name that sells nutritional supplements, bid $3.5 million.",
      "The bids were a fraction of the money that Jones has been ordered to pay in defamation lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas filed by relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook shooting. Lopez said the auction outcome \u201cleft a lot of money on the table\u201d for families.",
      "\u201cYou got to scratch and claw and get everything you can for them,\u201d Lopez said.",
      "Christopher Mattei, a lawyer for the Sandy Hook families who sued Jones in Connecticut, said they were disappointed in the judge's ruling.",
      "\u201cThese families, who have already persevered through countless delays and roadblocks, remain resilient and determined as ever to hold Alex Jones and his corrupt businesses accountable for the harm he has caused,\u201d Mattei said in a statement. \u201cThis decision doesn\u2019t change the fact that, soon, Alex Jones will begin to pay his debt to these families and he will continue doing so for as long as it takes.\u201d",
      "Jones, who did not attend the proceedings, quickly went back on the air to applaud the judge's decision.",
      "\u201cWe can celebrate the judge doing the right thing with the most ridiculous, fraudulent auction known in human history,\u201d he said.",
      "Although The Onion\u2019s cash offer was lower than that of First United American, it also included a pledge by many of the Sandy Hook families to forgo $750,000 of the auction proceeds due to them and give it to other creditors, providing the other creditors more money than they would receive under First United American\u2019s bid.",
      "The sale of Infowars is part of Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022 after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas filed by relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook shooting.",
      "Jones repeatedly called the shooting that killed 20 children and six educators a hoax staged by actors and aimed at increasing gun control. Parents and children of many of the victims testified in court that they were traumatized by Jones\u2019 conspiracies and threats from his followers.",
      "Jones has since acknowledged that the Connecticut school shooting happened.",
      "Most of the proceeds from the sale of Infowars, as well as many of Jones\u2019 personal assets, will go to the Sandy Hook families. Some proceeds will go to Jones\u2019 other creditors.",
      "Trustee Christopher Murray had defended The Onion\u2019s bid during a lengthy two-day hearing in Houston, testifying that he did not favor either bidder over the other and was not biased.",
      "He also revealed that First United American submitted a revised bid in recent days, but he said he could not accept it because the Sandy Hook families in the Connecticut lawsuit objected.",
      "The Onion valued its bid, with the Sandy Hook families\u2019 offer, at $7 million because that amount was equal to a purchase price that would provide the same amount of money to the other creditors.",
      "In a court filing last month, Murray's lawyers called First United American's request to disqualify The Onion's bid a \u201cdisappointed bidder's improper attempt to influence an otherwise fair and open election process.\u201d",
      "Jones' attorney, Ben Broocks, noted that the Sandy Hook lawsuit judgments could be overturned in pending appeals and got Murray to acknowledge that the Sandy Hook families' offer in The Onion bid could fall apart if that happens. That's because the percentage of the auction proceeds they would be entitled to could drop sharply and they wouldn't get the $750,000 from the sale to give to other creditors.",
      "Auctioneer Jeff Tanenbaum on Monday defended both the value of the bid and its selection.",
      "Up for sale were all the equipment and other assets in the Infowars studio in Austin, as well as the rights to its social media accounts, websites, video archive and product trademarks. Jones uses the studio to broadcast his far-right, conspiracy theory-filled shows on the Infowars website, his account on the social platform X and radio stations. Many of Jones' personal assets also are being sold.",
      "Jones has set up another studio, websites and social media accounts in case The Onion wins approval to buy Infowars and kicks him out. Jones has said he could continue using the Infowars platforms if the auction winner is friendly to him.",
      "Jones is appealing the money has been ordered to pay in judgments citing free speech rights."

      "About 87,000 people are being evacuated in a central Philippine region after a volcano erupted with a huge plume of ash and superhot streams of gas and debris hurtling down its slopes",
      "MANILA, Philippines -- About 87,000 people were being evacuated in a central Philippine region Tuesday a day after a volcano briefly erupted with a towering ash plume and superhot streams of gas and debris hurtling down its western slopes.",
      "The latest eruption of Mount Kanlaon on central Negros island did not cause any immediate casualties, but the alert level was raised one level, indicating further and more explosive eruptions may occur.",
      "Volcanic ash fell on a wide area, including Antique province, more than 200 kilometers (124 miles) across seawaters west of the volcano, obscuring visibility and posing health risks, Philippine chief volcanologist Teresito Bacolcol and other officials said by telephone.",
      "At least six domestic flights and a flight bound for Singapore were canceled and two local flights were diverted in the region Monday and Tuesday due to Kanlaon\u2019s eruption, according to the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines.",
      "The mass evacuations were being carried out urgently in towns and villages nearest the western and southern slopes of Kanlaon which were blanketed by its ash, including in La Castellana town in Negros Occidental where nearly 47,000 people have to be evacuated out of a 6-kilometer (3.7-mile) danger zone, the Office of Civil Defense said.",
      "More than 6,000 have moved to evacuation centers aside from those who have temporarily transferred to the homes of relatives in La Castellana by Tuesday morning, the town\u2019s mayor, Rhumyla Mangilimutan, told The Associated Press by telephone.",
      "President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said authorities were ready to provide support to large numbers of displaced villagers and that his social welfare secretary flew early Tuesday to the affected region.",
      "\"We are ready to support the families who have been evacuated outside the 6-kilometer danger zone,\u201d Marcos told reporters.",
      "Government scientists were monitoring the air quality due to the risk of contamination from toxic volcanic gases that may require more people to be evacuated from areas affected by Monday\u2019s eruption.",
      "Disaster-response contingents were rapidly establishing evacuation centers and seeking supplies of face masks, food and hygiene packs ahead of the Christmas season, traditionally a peak time for holiday travel and family celebrations in the largely Roman Catholic nation.",
      "Authorities also shut schools and imposed a nighttime curfew in the most vulnerable areas.",
      "The Philippines\u2019 Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said the nearly four-minute eruption of Kanlaon volcano on Monday afternoon had caused a pyroclastic density current \u2014 a superhot stream of gas, ash, debris and rocks that can incinerate anything in its path.",
      "\u201cIt's a one-time but major eruption,\u201d Bacolcol told the AP, adding that volcanologists were assessing if Monday's eruption spewed old volcanic debris and rocks clogged in and near the summit crater or was caused by rising magma from underneath.",
      "Few volcanic earthquakes were detected ahead of Monday's explosion, Bacolcol said.",
      "The alert level around Kanlaon was placed on Monday to the third-highest of a five-step warning system, indicating \u201cmagmatic eruption\" may have begun and may progress to further explosive eruptions.",
      "The 2,435-meter (7,988-foot) volcano, one of the country\u2019s 24 most-active volcanoes, last erupted in June sending hundreds of villagers to emergency shelters.",
      "In 1996, three hikers were killed near the peak and several others were later rescued when Kanlaon erupted without warning, officials said.",
      "Located in the so-called Pacific \u201cRing of Fire,\u201d a region prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, the Philippines is also lashed by about 20 typhoons and storms a year and is among the countries most prone to natural disasters."

    "story": [
      "California lawmakers will consider a bill to require labels on social media platforms warning of their effects on young people\u2019s lives",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California, home to some of the largest technology companies in the world, would be the first U.S. state to require mental health warning labels on social media sites if lawmakers pass a bill introduced Monday.",
      "The legislation sponsored by state Attorney General Rob Bonta is necessary to bolster safety for children online, supporters say, but industry officials vow to fight the measure and others like it under the First Amendment. Warning labels for social media gained swift bipartisan support from dozens of attorneys general, including Bonta, after U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called on Congress to establish the requirements earlier this year, saying social media is a contributing factor in the mental health crisis among young people.",
      "\u201cThese companies know the harmful impact their products can have on our children, and they refuse to take meaningful steps to make them safer,\u201d Bonta said at a news conference Monday. \u201cTime is up. It\u2019s time we stepped in and demanded change.\u201d",
      "State officials haven't provided details on the bill, but Bonta said the warning labels could pop up once weekly.",
      "Up to 95% of youth ages 13 to 17 say they use a social media platform, and more than a third say that they use social media \u201calmost constantly,\u201d according to 2022 data from the Pew Research Center. Parents\u2019 concerns prompted Australia to pass the world\u2019s first law banning social media for children under 16 in November.",
      "\u201cThe promise of social media, although real, has turned into a situation where they\u2019re turning our children\u2019s attention into a commodity,\u201d Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, who authored the California bill, said Monday. \u201cThe attention economy is using our children and their well-being to make money for these California companies.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers instead should focus on online safety education and mental health resources, not warning label bills that are \u201cconstitutionally unsound,\u201d said Todd O\u2019Boyle, a vice president of the tech industry policy group Chamber of Progress.",
      "\u201cWe strongly suspect that the courts will set them aside as compelled speech,\u201d O\u2019Boyle told The Associated Press.",
      "Victoria Hinks' 16-year-old daughter, Alexandra, died by suicide four months ago after being \u201cled down dark rabbit holes\u201d on social media that glamorized eating disorders and self-harm. Hinks said the labels would help protect children from companies that turn a blind eye to the harm caused to children\u2019s mental health when they become addicted to social media platforms.",
      "\u201cThere's not a bone in my body that doubts social media played a role in leading her to that final, irreversible decision,\u201d Hinks said. \u201cThis could be your story.\"",
      "Common Sense Media, a sponsor of the bill, said it plans to lobby for similar proposals in other states.",
      "California in the past decade has positioned itself as a leader in regulating and fighting the tech industry to bolster online safety for children.",
      "The state was the first in 2022 to bar online platforms from using users\u2019 personal information in ways that could harm children. It was one of the states that sued Meta in 2023 and TikTok in October for deliberately designing addictive features that keep kids hooked on their platforms.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, also signed several bills in September to help curb the effects of social media on children, including one to prohibit social media platforms from knowingly providing addictive feeds to children without parental consent and one to limit or ban students from using smartphones on school campus.",
      "Federal lawmakers have held hearings on child online safety and legislation is in the works to force companies to take reasonable steps to prevent harm. The legislation has the support of X owner Elon Musk and the President-elect\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr. Still, the last federal law aimed at protecting children online was enacted in 1998, six years before Facebook\u2019s founding."

      "Attorneys for Meta shareholders are asking a Delaware judge to sanction former Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and fellow Facebook board member and current White House chief of staff Jeff Zients for deleting emails related to the Cambridge Anal...",
      "WILMINGTON, Del. -- Attorneys for Meta shareholders asked a Delaware judge Monday to sanction the company's former Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and fellow Facebook board member and current White House chief of staff Jeff Zients for deleting emails related to the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal, despite being told to preserve such records.",
      "The plaintiff attorneys contend that Sandberg and Zients used personal email accounts to communicate about key issues relating to their 2018 shareholder lawsuit that alleged Facebook officers and directors violated both the law and their fiduciary duties in failing for years to protect the privacy of user data.",
      "\u201cAlthough Sandberg and Zients received a litigation hold requiring them to preserve documents from these accounts, they both knowingly and permanently destroyed electronically stored information from such sources,\u201d attorneys said in a court filing.",
      "The plaintiffs say the former board members were either \u201creckless or intentional\u201d in destroying documents, noting that Sandberg deleted communications to and from her Gmail account after only 30 days, even after being notified of the \u201clitigation hold\u201d to preserve documents. Zients never disabled an auto-delete function on his email account, even though he, too, received a litigation hold and consulted with lawyers, they said.",
      "The plaintiffs argue that Sandberg and Zients should be prohibited from testifying about information they sent or received using their personal email accounts. They also say the burden of proof for any affirmative defense they present should be raised to a standard of \u201cclear and convincing evidence,\u201d instead of the lower standard of a \u201cpreponderance\u201d of the evidence.",
      "Sandberg was deposed last week. Plaintiff attorney Max Huffman said Zients is \u201cbusy\u201d and will be deposed in February \u201cafter there\u2019s an effective transition in Washington.\u201d",
      "Defense attorney Berton Ashman described the email deletions as \u201cunfortunate\u201d but argued that the plaintiffs have not shown that they were prejudiced in any way.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no intent here to destroy relevant or responsive information,\u201d Ashman told Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster, adding that there no \u201ctrove of missing emails.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no grand scheme or suggestion of bad behavior,\u201d he added.",
      "Ashman said the vast majority of emails that Sandberg and Zients sent or received using their personal accounts were also received by other individuals at Facebook. He suggested that any emails that may have been deleted have been made available to the plaintiffs from other sources at Facebook.",
      "Huffman, the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer, said Sandberg does not deserve the benefit of the doubt.",
      "\u201cShe unilaterally controlled what was kept and what was destroyed,\u201d he told the judge.",
      "Laster, who is scheduled to preside over a non-jury trial in April, said he wanted to see a transcript of Sandberg\u2019s deposition before ruling on the motion for sanctions.",
      "Last year, the judge rejected a defense motion arguing that the lawsuit should be dismissed because the plaintiffs did not first demand that Facebook\u2019s board take legal action before filing litigation themselves. He agreed with the plaintiffs that such a demand would have been futile because of doubts that a majority of the relevant Facebook board members, many with close personal and business ties to Mark Zuckerberg, would be willing to confront the CEO and founder of the company over its privacy failures.",
      "Laster noted that, in deciding on a motion to dismiss, he was required to accept the allegations in the complaint as true.",
      "The complaint alleges that Facebook officials repeatedly and continually violated a 2012 consent order with the Federal Trade Commission under which Facebook agreed to stop collecting and sharing personal data on platform users and friends without their consent.",
      "Facebook later sold user data to commercial partners in direct violation of the consent order and removed disclosures from privacy settings that were required under consent order, the lawsuit alleges. The company\u2019s conduct resulted in significant fines from regulators in Europe and culminated in  the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018.  That case involved a British political consulting firm hired by Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign that paid a Facebook app developer for the personal information of tens of millions Facebook users.",
      "The fallout led to Facebook agreeing to pay unprecedented $5 billion penalty to settle FTC charges that the company violated the 2012 consent order by deceiving users about their ability to protect their personal information."

      "Considered a bellwether for artificial intelligence demand, Nvidia has led the AI sector to become one of the stock market\u2019s biggest companies, as tech giants spend heavily on the company\u2019s chips and data centers needed to train and operate their AI systems.",
      "Nvidia's shares have surged this year along with the California company's revenue and profit due to AI demand. According to data firm FactSet, about 16% of Nvidia's revenue comes from China, second only to its U.S.-generated revenue.",
      "A spokesperson for the company based in Santa Clara, California, said in an emailed statement that Nvidia is \u201chappy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business.\u201d",

Nvidia earned $19.31 billion in the quarter, more than double the $9.24 billion it posted in last year\u2019s third quarter. The earnings release did not break out revenue from China.",
      "The company's market value rocketed to $3.5 trillion recently, passing Microsoft and briefly overtaking Apple as the world's most valuable company.",
      "China\u2019s antitrust investigation follows a report this summer by technology news site The Information that the U.S. Justice Department was investigating complaints from rivals that Nvidia was abusing its market dominance in the chip sector. The allegations reported include Nvidia threatening to punish those who buy products from both itself and its competitors at the same time.",
      "David Bieri, an international finance expert at Virginia Tech, said that China\u2019s investigation is \u201cnot about what Nvidia is doing in China, per se\u201d but rather a signal to the incoming Trump administration. China, Bieri said, is looking to set the tone of future relations.",
      "The Chinese government, he said, is telling the U.S. \u201cdon\u2019t mess with us, because all of your darling corporations that your version of capitalism needs to prosper have entanglements\u201d with China.",
      "Nvidia will have to revise its strategy in China or come up with provisions in their budgets for the type of uncertainty business with China will bring, Bieri said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think this is something that they can shake off,\u201d he said. \u201cI also have a tremendous amount of faith in the brilliance of the management strategy of a corporation like Nvidia to not only pay attention to credit risk, market risk and operational risk, but also to political risk.\u201d",
      "Nvidia\u2019s invention of graphics processor chips, or GPUs, in 1999 helped spark the growth of the PC gaming market and redefined computer graphics.",

      "Attorneys for the two companies are asking the appeals court to decide on the request for an enforcement pause by Dec. 16. The Department of Justice said in a court filing on Monday that it will oppose the request. Justice officials also suggested that an expedited decision denying TikTok's request would give the Supreme Court more time to consider the case."

      "There were no immediate reports of casualties in the latest explosion of Mount Kanlaon, on central Negros island, but authorities shut schools and imposed a nighttime curfew after ash falling in several villages clouded the the visibility of motorists and sparked health concerns.",
      "\u201cIt sounded like a cannon,\u201d Mayor Jose Chubasco Cardenas of Canlaon city, which lies southeast of the volcano, told The Associated Press by telephone. \u201cThere have been quiet eruptions before, but this was one very loud.\u201d",
      "Disaster-response officials raised the danger level around Kanlaon due to \u201ca greater risk of hazardous volcanic activity\u201d and ordered villagers within a 6-kilometer (3.7-mile) radius of the crater to be evacuated.",
      "About 100 people had fled to emergency shelters in Canlaon by nightfall after the midafternoon volcanic eruption, Cardenas said. The number of displaced people could reach more than 2,000 due to stronger prospects of more eruption, he added.",
      "The Philippines' Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said the eruption had caused a pyroclastic density current \u2014 a superhot stream of ash, debris and rocks that can incinerate anything in its path.",

      "The Onion's bid to buy conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' Infowars returned to a Texas courtroom",
      "An auction company executive involved in the liquidation of Alex Jones\u2019 conspiracy theory platform Infowars testified for nearly five hours Monday, as a bankruptcy judge in Texas began a hearing into whether The Onion satirical news outlet was properly named the winning bidder over a company affiliated with Jones.",
      "Jeff Tanenbaum, president of ThreeSixty Asset Advisors, was grilled by lawyers for Jones and the company in a Houston courtroom over how The Onion\u2019s bid came to be valued at $7 million and why a live auction was not held. He defended both the value of the bid and its selection after the two sealed offers were opened.",
      "U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez continued the hearing to Tuesday afternoon, when the trustee overseeing the sale of Jones\u2019 assets is expected to take the stand. Lopez could ultimately decide whether to void The Onion\u2019s bid, name the Jones-affiliated company the winner or hold another auction, among other possibilities.",
      "Jones and First United American Companies, which runs a website in Jones\u2019 name that sells nutritional supplements and submitted the other bid, are alleging fraud and collusion in the auction that concluded on Nov. 14. The trustee and The Onion deny the allegations, accusing Jones and the company of sour grapes.",
      "The sale of Infowars is part of Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022 after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas filed by relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut. Jones repeatedly called the 2012 shooting that killed 20 children and six educators a hoax staged by actors and aimed at increasing gun control.",
      "Most of the proceeds from the sale of Infowars, as well as many of Jones\u2019 personal assets, will go to the Sandy Hook families to help satisfy judgments issued by juries and judges in state courts in Connecticut and Texas. Some proceeds will go to Jones\u2019 other creditors.",
      "The Onion, which wants to turn Infowars\u2019 website and social media accounts into parodies, offered $1.75 million for Infowars\u2019 assets in the auction, while First United American Companies bid $3.5 million.",
      "But The Onion\u2019s bid also included a pledge by many of the Sandy Hook families to forgo some or all of the auction proceeds due to them to give other creditors a total of $100,000 more than they would receive under other bids.",
      "The trustee, Christopher Murray, chose The Onion, saying its proposal was better for creditors because they would receive more money. The Onion valued the bid, with the Sandy Hook families\u2019 offer, at $7 million, because that amount was equal to a purchase price that would provide the same amount of money to the other creditors.",
      "Tanenbaum testified that he agreed with the $7 million valuation and believed The Onion\u2019s bid conformed to the auction rules.",
      "A lawyer for Jones, Ben Broocks, asked Tanenbaum how it was possible that the Sandy Hook families\u2019 offer boosted The Onion\u2019s offer to such a high amount.",
      "\u201cIt means the purchase price value has gone up because another purchase price would have to be higher than that value in order to provide the same net benefit to that group of creditors,\u201d Tanenbaum said.",
      "During his opening argument, Broocks said there was no way The Onion should have been chosen over First United American.",
      "\u201cHow does a $1.75 million bid beat a $3.5 million bid?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow is that $1.75 million greater? Well, it\u2019s voodoo economics to use a phrase.\u201d",
      "Broocks and a lawyer for First United American, Walter Cicack, also questioned why a live bidding round wasn\u2019t held after the sealed offers weren\u2019t submitted, as they said they expected, but the judge\u2019s order made live bidding optional.",
      "Jones has been criticizing the sale process on his show and social media sites, calling it \u201crigged\u201d and a \u201cfraud.\u201d",
      "Joshua Wolfshohl, an attorney for Murray, told the judge Monday that no wrongdoing occurred during the auction. He called the complaints by Jones and First United American Companies unfounded.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of their complaints are just fantastic, imagined conspiracy theories that have no basis in reality,\u201d he said.",
      "Murray, The Onion and the Sandy families deny allegations of wrongdoing. In his own court filing, Murray called the allegations \u201ca disappointed bidder\u2019s improper attempt to influence an otherwise fair and open auction process.\u201d",
      "Up for sale at the auction were all the equipment and other assets in the Infowars studio in Austin, Texas, as well as its social media accounts, websites, video archive and product trademarks. Jones uses the studio to broadcast his far-right, conspiracy theory-filled shows on the Infowars website, his account on the social platform X and radio stations.",
      "Jones has set up another studio, websites and social media accounts in case The Onion wins approval to buy Infowars and kicks him out. Jones has said he could continue using the Infowars platforms if the auction winner is friendly to him.",
      "Jones is appealing the $1.5 billion in judgments citing free speech rights but has acknowledged that the school shooting happened.",
      "On Friday, a Connecticut appeals court reduced by $150 million the original $1.44 billion judgment against Jones in the lawsuit against him in that state, but upheld the rest of the award. Jones\u2019 lawyer said he will ask Connecticut\u2019s highest court to review the appellate ruling. Jones is also appealing a $50 million judgment in a similar Texas defamation lawsuit."

      "\"I'll be looking at J6 early on, maybe the first nine minutes,\" he told the magazine.",
      "Trump was repeatedly pressed if he would pardon all rioters, including those who were convicted for violent offenses.",

A vast majority should not be in jail, and they've suffered gravely.\"",
      "Discussing his pledge to oversee mass deportations, Trump said he was willing to use the military to find and deport migrants living in the U.S. without legal permission -- which would mark a shift as the military doesn't normally engage with domestic law enforcement issues.",
      "When asked what he would do if the military refuses such an order, Trump replied: \"I'll only do what the law allows, but I will go up to the maximum level of what the law allows.\"",
      "He was also asked about grocery prices, something Trump's cited as key to his victory over Vice President Kamala Harris. Inflation spiked to a peak of more than 9% during the Biden-Harris administration but has since cooled to 2.7% as of November.",
      "Trump vowed to lower prices down throughout his campaign, even displaying food items like bacon or eggs during one of his events. But in his sit-down with Time, Trump brushed off whether his presidency would be considered a \"failure\" if he failed to do so.",
      "\"I don't think so. Look, they got them up. I'd like to bring them down,\" Trump said. \"It's hard to bring things down once they're up. You know, it's very hard. But I think that they will.\"",

      "\"If President Biden wanted to talk to me about that, I would talk to him about it. But I don't think I should be giving public advice on the pardon power. I think it's too -- it's a very personal thing, but it is -- I hope he won't do that,\" Clinton said.",
      "\"Most of us get out of this world ahead of where we'd get if all we got was simple justice. And so it's normally a fool's errand. You spend a lot of time trying to get even,\" he added.",
      "President Biden and his senior aides have been discussing possible preemptive pardons for people who might be targeted by the new Trump administration, according to a source close to the president. Experts have told ABC News he has the power to do so under the Constitution.",
      "Clinton emphasized that he does not believe any potential charges from the incoming Trump administration brought against Hillary Clinton would be valid, arguing that she did not do anything wrong with her handling of emails during her time at the State Department -- a controversy which became a flashpoint late in the 2016 election cycle.",
      "Asked separately about his recent comments that a Republican could be more likely to be the first female president, Clinton said, \"The impulse to say a woman probably shouldn't be president comes more from the right than from the left -- in the brain -- and it's an impulsive thing.\"",
      "He also surmised that voters are not always looking toward how much experience a politician had, because of how they're focused on day-to-day issues.",
      "\"If you're an alienated voter and you're genuinely worried about your family's financial security or your personal security, then the last thing you want is somebody who's well qualified \u2026 if you think the total sum of impact of government action is negative, then you may not want somebody who's well qualified,\" Clinton said.",
      "\"And that's the danger we're at now, because it actually does matter if you know things.\"",
      "Asked about what may happen after Trump's victory, Clinton emphasized that Trump won fairly.",
      "\"So, I think what we have to do is to observe a peaceful transfer of power, stand up for what we believe, and work together when we can,\" Clinton said.",
      "\"I do not think we should just be jamming them, even though they do that to us a lot. I think it's a mistake,\" he added.",
      "During the 2024 campaign cycle, Bill Clinton campaigned for Vice President Kamala Harris, serving as a key surrogate sent to rural areas and to speak with working-class voters.",
      "Asked how Democrats can win back working-class voters who have been shifting to support Republicans, Clinton said that he feels part of the challenge is \"cultural,\" as rural voters skewer more conservative and are dealing with things they are not used to.",
      "\"The world moves on, and things that once made sense to people don't anymore,\" he said. \"The world moves on, and things that once made sense to people don't anymore. Things that should make sense don't anymore.\"",
      "\"We need to quit screaming at each other and listen to each other. We need to have a serious conversation about these things. And I think one of the things that Democrats sometimes do is give up on too many people, because the demographics say they're not going to be for it,\" Clinton said.",
      "\"Well, that may be, but you know, if you don't deal with something that's controversial, just because you don't want to hear it, that's like an insult to voters.\"",
      "Clinton has devoted time to charitable and health causes since his presidency, and his memoir \"Citizen: My Life After the White House\" released in November.",
      "\"First, it was fun, and secondly, it was important,\" Clinton said of his charitable work. \"And thirdly, I could do it. And it didn't matter if the president was Barack Obama or George Bush, we just did things that human beings needed.\"",

      "A woman was killed after crashing into a officer responding to the threat.",
      "The death of a woman this week in a car crash involving a police officer who was responding to a bomb threat against Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's Georgia home demonstrates the growing danger of swatting, police and experts said.",
      "Swatting refers to when a false threat is made to draw police and first responders to a location.",
      "The woman, identified by police as Tammie Pickelsimer, was killed after crashing into a bomb squad member who was responding to the call, according to a statement from the Rome Police Department.",
      "According to police, the threat was sent by email to them last week, but it was re-routed to a junk folder. Police on Monday discovered the email which correctly listed the congresswoman's home address.",
      "Greene was not home at the time, but the message from the email specifically targeted the congresswoman's mailbox, Greene posted on X.",
      "The email spurred a response from police who then sent an officer to monitor the mailbox while waiting for the bomb squad.",
      "Rome police sergeant and bomb squad member David Metroka was en route to join the bomb squad at their headquarters when he crashed into the 66-year-old Pickelsimer, Georgia State Patrol said.",
      "Picklesimer suffered significant injuries and later died at the hospital, according to GSP. The officer had minor injuries and was later released from the hospital.",
      "Police did not find a bomb at Greene's home. In a statement, the Rome Police Department addressed the dangers of swatting incidents.",
      "\"The Rome Police Department continues to work closely with Congresswoman Greene's staff to address the growing concern of swatting incidents and has implemented protocols to ensure that emergency responses are only triggered when truly necessary,\" the police department said in a statement. \"This particular situation did not require an emergency response.\"",
      "The police department added, \"The Rome Police Department extends its heartfelt condolences to the Pickelsimer family during this difficult time. The department holds the individual responsible for sending the threatening email fully accountable for setting this tragic chain of events into motion. In collaboration with Congresswoman Greene's office, the Rome Police Department is working with federal authorities to ensure the perpetrator is apprehended and brought to justice.\"",
      "The Rome Police Department told ABC News the email had an IP address linked to Russia.",
      "Greene said she \"felt heartsick,\" and expressed her concern over violent political threats in a statement on X.",
      "\"These violent political threats have fatal consequences,\" she said. \"It\u2019s an undue strain on our law enforcement who must treat them seriously. The officer was responding to protect my life. And now, a woman has lost her life because of this despicable act.\"",
      "According to John Bandler, an adjunct professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, swatting is a harassment tactic used to dispatch an \"arm of government\" for emergency services.",
      "Bandler believes the uptick in swatting stems from cyber crimes allowing criminals to commit a crime against someone else without having to get close to it, he said.",
      "\"It is a way people can do a crime and they think they won't get caught doing it,\" Bandler said. \"And it seems much more an indirect way of doing it.\"",
      "Most people are never going to be swatted, Bandler said. But he notes it will be hard to protect yourself from this sort of crime, just like it is to protect yourself from all crime, he said.",
      "Bandler calls for all swatting attempts to be prosecuted as a felony in every state and on the federal level. Swatting becomes a felony on the federal level when it crosses state lines.",
      "He said swatting is extremely dangerous and scatters police efforts.",
      "\"Not only are you wasting law enforcement's time, but you're triggering that emergency response and that is always going to be dangerous,\" Bandler said.",
      "Greene said her office is cooperating with local law enforcement and the FBI as they investigate the threat."

    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 14:07:19 -0500",
    "summary": "A pressure campaign from allies of Donald Trump toward Senate skeptics of some of his Cabinet picks appears to be starting to pay off",
    "story": [
      "\"The president's been very clear of what he wants,\" one Republican said.",
      "A pressure campaign from allies of Donald Trump toward Senate Republican skeptics of some of his Cabinet picks appears to be starting to pay off in a sign of the president-elect's anticipated sway once he enters the Oval Office next month.",
      "Some GOP senators, such Joni Ernst of Iowa and South Carolina's Lindsey Graham, who had been dubious about how they'd vote on Pete Hegseth, the former Fox News host and Trump's pick for Pentagon chief, are sounding more optimistic on getting to \"yes,\" even if they're not quite there yet.",
      "And broader furor around other controversial nominees, including former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard to be director of national intelligence, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, and Kash Patel to lead the FBI has drawn fewer headlines as the picks meet with senators, though all three are still expected to face tight confirmation processes.",
      "The shifts have come after Trump allies in Washington and in the news media underscored the importance of the president-elect getting his preferred administration in place and shone a glaring spotlight on potential holdouts, making clear that nothing short of their political survival was at stake.",
      "\"A month ago, they had running room and courage to oppose Hegseth. They've run out of runway and any courage now is false because the MAGA base is onto them and will make them pay,\" said one source close to the transition, referencing Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" mantra.",
      "After it appeared that Hegseth's nomination was on life support, the pressure campaign kicked into high gear.",
      "Trump himself has been more vocal recently about Hegseth, saying on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" over the weekend that \"we'll be working on his nomination\" and \"I've had a lot of senators calling me up saying he's fantastic.\" Trump's transition also released what essentially amounted to a hype video Tuesday, touting some senators' glowing remarks about Hegseth.",
      "A conservative group with ties to Elon Musk, the world's richest man who has carved out a powerful role inside Trump's orbit, is also spending $500,000 on a new ad pushing the Senate to confirm Hegseth. The ads push viewers to \"call your senator today and urge them to confirm Pete Hegseth\" and are airing nationally -- but also targeting digital platforms in Ernst's home state of Iowa.",
      "Those moves, compounded by electoral threats from Trump online media allies like Steve Bannon and Dan Bongino, seem to have moved the needle, even as Hegseth continues to bat away allegations of excessive drinking and sexual misconduct from former colleagues and one woman who claims he raped her.",
      "After predicting there would be \"a very thorough vetting before [Hegseth] moves forward,\" Ernst said after an \"encouraging\" meeting Monday, \"As I support Pete through this process, I look forward to a fair hearing based on truth, not anonymous sources.\"",
      "Graham, who had cast the claims against Hegseth as serious, also said Monday that he had \"a very positive, thorough and candid meeting\u201d with Hegseth and echoed that accusations should be \"supported by testimony before Congress -- not anonymous sources.\"",
      "The movement indicates the immense power Trump and his allies hold, and how influential they could be with the party's base. And the political graveyard is packed with the careers of Republican lawmakers who defied Trump, only to lose office in a primary.",
      "\"We will use every resource at our disposal to make sure that every one of Trump's nominees and Cabinet picks are confirmed. And if that does not happen, the ultimate recourse will be at the ballot box for those elected officials who choose to not vote for them,\" said a second source close to the transition. \"That includes Pete, that includes Bobby, that includes Kash, includes everybody.\"",
      "\"We've been very clear. And the president has made calls to various U.S. senators for some of his nominees. The president's been very clear of what he wants. Elon Musk has been very clear,\" the person added. \"When you're the world's richest man, and you have $350 billion, that makes politicians quake.\"",
      "To be sure, Hegseth himself has also been putting in the work to get confirmed. He's continued to deny the allegations against him, held a blitz of meetings with senators, and Ernst said he committed to appointing a senior official who would tackle the issue of sexual assault within the military.",
      "But the role of Trump's allies can't be dismissed.",
      "The pressure campaign is coming ahead of a new Congress in which Republicans will hold a 53-47 Senate majority, meaning any Cabinet pick cannot afford to lose more than three GOP votes if Democrats vote unanimously in opposition.",
      "Members of Congress are historically fervent in their defense of their role as an equal branch of government -- a role manifested in their \"advice and consent\" function regarding a president's Cabinet picks. Already, Senate opposition sunk the fortunes of former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., Trump's pick for attorney general who had been accused of sexual misconduct that he denied.",
      "Yet Trump has a unique hold on his base, and threats of primaries in cases of disloyalty may be a permanent fixture for lawmakers to prevent opposition to Cabinet picks to mushroom over the next several weeks -- and to enforce support over next four years.",
      "\"I think that these senators are very susceptible to pressure because they've witnessed what's happened to members who are now former members who opposed the president. So, we're seeing a lot of members change their tune because they're worried and they don't ever be primaried out of office, and they don't want to have the president having some cross words for them,\" said Brian Darling, a GOP strategist and former Senate aide.",
      "\"Republicans may not appreciate it in the Senate, but it's a fact of life,\" he added.",
      "Already, damage may have been done for Senate GOP critics, some Republicans warned.",
      "Even if every Republican senator comes around on all of Trump's picks, the president-elect's supporters have long memories -- and the strain of populism that is one of the country's dominant political drivers has piqued anti-incumbent fervor.",
      "\"Even her pushback has been noticed in Iowa,\" Bob Vander Plaats, an influential Christian conservative leader in Iowa, said of Ernst. \"You've seen a lot of people push back on her because of it, and there's been some calls from primarily those outside of Iowa going, 'she probably should be primaried.' I haven't seen anything real of that measure in Iowa yet. But it's a primary rich environment today.\"",

    "story": [
      "They say Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs is their biggest concern.",
      "As Democratic governors prepare to navigate and resist parts of President-elect Donald Trump's next administration, one told ABC News she is most alarmed by Trump's tariff plan.",
      "\"Tariffs would be devastating to our economy, especially with the amount of trade we do with Canada,\" Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey told ABC News.",
      "Trump has threatened to impose a 25% across the board tariff on Mexico and Canada, in addition to a 10% tariff on goods imported from China. These are the U.S.'s top three trading partners. Economists warn this would raise prices on everyday goods and wreak havoc on the economy.",
      "\"I'm a governor who's come in, cut taxes, worked to lower housing costs, grow the economy. If he were to impose tariffs -- it would first of all -- I think it's not smart to do -- and it would be devastating to consumers,\" Healey said, \"Think about all the housing we're trying to build here right now -- what will that do to housing costs?\"",
      "In an interview with NBC News that aired on Sunday, Trump said he couldn't guarantee that his tariff plan would not raise prices for American consumers.",
      "Other Democratic governors, who gathered last weekend for the first time since the election for a winter meeting in Beverly Hills, California, said Trump's tariff proposals were a chief concern among a number of others: threats to entitlements, his immigration proposals, and repeals of climate and reproductive protections. Several high-profile governors told ABC News they're deep into preparations to use legislative, executive or legal actions to combat Trump's moves.",
      "At the Beverly Hilton over the weekend, the tight-knit group of Democratic talent -- many of whom will be some of the strongest detractors of Trump's policies and also some of the best-positioned to be at the top of the party's presidential ticket in 2028 -- gathered for private, closed-door meetings with one another, donors and other stakeholders. The group of about 18 governors and governors-elect, hosted by California Gov. Gavin Newsom, focused on how to navigate through Trump's leadership, according to several who spoke with ABC News, rather than any significant post-election analysis following the Democrats' losses last month.",
      "The group of governors in Beverly Hills included many of the likely 2028 contenders, including blue state leaders like Newsom and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who have been actively on offense against Republican leadership since Nov. 6, and red state ones like Democratic Governors Association Vice Chair and Chair-elect Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear.",
      "Healey, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz were also on the guest list -- many of whom have questions looming about their own political futures.",
      "\"I would expect that we'll put up quite a fight to take the House back. And I think that we'll have an incredible bench in the primary '28,\" New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham told ABC News about the plans of many of the governors.",
      "The governors are striking different tones as they prepare for Trump's presidency.",
      "The strongest, most combative voices of course have been from leaders like Newsom, who initiated a recently convened a special legislative session in California to increase funding for its Department of Justice and other agencies so they'll be able to quickly file litigation to challenge actions taken by a second Trump administration. Pritzker, too, has made not-so-veiled threats about how he'd approach the administration should it \"come for\" his people, and recently announced his position as co-chair, along with Jared Polis of Colorado, of a new nonpartisan coalition of governors committed to protecting the \"state-level institutions of democracy\" ahead of Trump's presidency.",
      "Other governors encouraged their peers to meet this moment offensively through their agendas.",
      "\"Democratic governors should approach this with strength and resolution and an activist agenda. Because this is the place where we can make progress too,\" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee told ABC News.",
      "\"You can't stop some 85% of the things I would like to do in that state, so I think the order of the day is defend where we can in fighting with an advance every day with our own ambitions and unaffected by him, so that shadow doesn't fall in our state,\" said Inslee, who is leaving his seat this winter to make way for incoming Gov. Bob Ferguson.",
      "But a different group of governors are acting much more lukewarm in their approaches, emphasizing their desire to \"work\" with the Trump administration and some citing past collaborations with the president-elect's team, like during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Beshear said last weekend that Democrats needed to lean into \"reason\" while Trump is in office and that he's willing to work with the incoming administration.",
      "\"The middle ground, middle of the road, common ground, common sense, is open. It's open,\" Beshear told a group of reporters on Saturday.",
      "Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, the DGA's chair, said this weekend that she wasn't yet anticipating Trump or his agencies' actions, but \"We will always look for ways to work together\" with the caveat that she'll \"draw the line\" on things \"that they push us to do that we think are wrong, illegal, anything like that.\"",
      "The varying approaches from governors to Trump's agenda could be a coordinated strategy as the group wrestles with how best to support each other within a party attempting to rebuild -- a complicated task as they also eye each other as potential presidential primary competition.",
      "\"We know how to create space to protect people and protect the priorities,\" Lujan Grisham told ABC, noting that she and many other governors aren't officially part of Pritzker and Polis' new coalition, for example. \"We did it on climate. We still do it on climate. We did it on reproductive premiums, we're gonna have to still do it on reproductive premiums, and we'll do some test cases in states that allow us to frame and direct these coalitions.\"",
      "\"We want to be strategic about what it is that we are announcing. And here's why: We've got a president-elect and a team that, before this and every day, said 'We're going to punish anyone in our way, and we're going to particularly punish states,'\" she went on. \"And the difference in California versus New Mexico -- California is definitely on the radar. I don't minimize what the Trump administration can negatively do to my state, but we're also very effective at watching and understanding what's occurring, and then we can deploy our joint efforts pretty damn fast.\"",
      "While governors can mount legal fights against parts of Trump's plan, the president can use executive power to impose sweeping tariffs.",
      "But for immigration, on the other hand, governors can resist Trump's proposals in clearer ways.",
      "Border state Gov. Lujan Grisham told ABC News she'd block Trump's ability to use detention centers, deploy the National Guard or even request data in her state if he attempted mass deportations.",
      "\"I take him at his word. He says he's going to do, try to do mass deportations,\" she said, adding that she wouldn't be a partner in those moves: \"There's a lot that he can't do by himself.\" .\"I mean, I've made it very clear over a number of years on this issue is that I will not use our National Guard to perform that kind of service,\" Kelly told reporters.",
      "\"I will not send them to the border. We have had Guard members go to the border, but they have been federalized when they've been down there. I don't see that as the role of the National Guard -- they are there to serve Kansas, Kansas issues, so I don't see that changing... The State Police are mine, and it's not their job, either. So we will take the same approach as we have with the Guard,\" Kelly added.",
      "On immigration, most Democratic governors agree that violent criminals need to be deported, noting that it's always been the case that local and state law enforcement work with federal authorities on investigating crimes. But where many governors draw the line is on deporting undocumented immigrants who have been living and working in America for a long time, arguing it's inhumane and damages the economy.",
      "\"We don't know what President Trump's immigration plan is going to look like at the end of the day. He is a master of saying something, creating a great deal of noise, and then the reality may be different. So I'm going to wait to see exactly what it is he ultimately proposes,\" incoming North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein told reporters about his plans to respond to Trump's immigration moves.",
      "\"The people of North Carolina have every right to be safe in their communities, and anybody who commits a violent crime must be held accountable, fully, and that's whether they're in this country as American citizens or they're here as undocumented people, and if they're here undocumented, they should be deported,\" Stein said.",
      "They also question how Trump will execute his plan. Trump could direct the National Guard to help with transport and logistics, but one Democratic governor told ABC News these are precious resources, and they need their National Guard for emergencies like storms, fires and severe flooding.",
      "Trump's team has discussed in the past how to strip federal resources from Democratic-run cities if they refuse to work with the administration on deporting undocumented immigrants, according to sources familiar with the matter.",
      "Blue state governors say they're concerned about the Trump administration weaponizing federal funding and \"picking winners and losers.\" One governor told ABC News their state is focused on locking down every federal dollar the state is entitled to, and securing all of the funding made available through the Biden administration's infrastructure law and CHIPS and Science Act.",
      "In California, Newsom has also started to \"Trump-proof\" his budget, which is one of the aims of his move to convene the legislature last week.",

    "title": "America's swing to the right in 2024 was wide, if not always deep",
    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 16:58:42 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump gained ground in every state and most counties in the 2024 election compared to 2020.",
    "story": [
      "Trump gained ground in every state and most counties compared to 2020.",
      "Despite what you may have heard, the 2024 election was pretty close. President-elect Donald Trump won a clear victory in the Electoral College, but he leads outgoing Vice President Kamala Harris in the national popular vote by only 1.5 percentage points, 49.8 percent to 48.3 percent* \u2014 one of the smallest margins ever in a presidential race.",
      "Nonetheless, the magnitude of Trump's triumph may appear much larger because it featured a major swing to the right from where the nation voted in 2020. As President Joe Biden defeated Trump by about 4.5 points nationally four years ago, Trump's 2024 advantage represents about a 6-point shift to the right, which is the largest swing toward either party since 2008. Back then, Barack Obama's 7.3-point edge represented a nearly 10-point swing to the left from George W. Bush's 2.5-point win in 2004.",
      "Yet the national swing only tells part of the story. What particularly stands out this year is the breadth of the swing in Trump's direction across not only the 50 states and the District of Columbia, but also an overwhelming majority of the more than 3,000 counties or their equivalents in the United States. Compared with his showing in 2020, Trump didn't pick up a huge amount of ground in many places, but he did gain at least a little bit nearly everywhere. We can see this by drilling into the state-level and county-level data below.",
      "Every state swung to the right in 2024",
      "From one presidential election to the next, more states usually swing toward the party that gains ground compared with how it performed four years earlier. However, it's rare for every state to move in the same direction, even in elections where one candidate wins decisively. After all, changes in the makeup of the party coalitions and the varying appeal of individual candidates can lead different states to move in opposite directions. Plus, at least in a few historical cases, a third-party candidate may have won a meaningful share of the vote that cut more into one party's coalition than another.",
      "But in 2024, all 50 states and D.C. swung to the right to varying degrees based on their margins versus the 2020 race. This marked the first presidential election since 1976 in which all 51 components of the Electoral College moved in the same direction relative to how they voted four years earlier.",
      "Unlike 1976, though, all 50 states and D.C. moved to the right in 2024 even though the previous election was also highly competitive. That wasn't the case in the closely fought 1976 race won by Jimmy Carter: His victory came four years after a landslide result in 1972, when Richard Nixon carried 49 states and won by 23 points nationally \u2014 the largest popular vote edge a candidate has earned in the post-World War II era \u2014 making 1976's leftward swing more of a return to a highly competitive baseline.",
      "Although six other elections since 1976 featured larger swings than in 2024, at least one state in each of those contests still moved toward the party that lost ground. In 1980, Vermont was the only state where Carter's margin improved even as he lost reelection badly to Ronald Reagan. In 1984, Reagan built significantly on his 1980 margins while winning the only definite landslide since Nixon's 1972 victory, but seven states and D.C. still voted more Democratic than they had four years earlier. Republicans lost ground in 49 states while winning again in 1988, but George H.W. Bush's margin grew very slightly over Reagan's in Tennessee and D.C. When the elder Bush lost reelection in 1992, he did worse in nearly every state, but still managed to improve his margin slightly in Iowa. And when Obama won by the largest margin in recent years in 2008, five now-dark red states trended right (Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Tennessee and West Virginia).",
      "While every state swung to the right in 2024, the extent of that swing did vary quite a bit. Weighted by each state's share of the national popular vote, the average state shifted 5.6 points to the right by margin from its 2020 result. Leading the way was New York, which Harris only won by about 13 points after Biden carried it by 23 points \u2014 a swing of more than 10 points. Other populous blue states like New Jersey (10 points) and California (9 points) also swung notably to the right, as did large red states like Florida (10 points) and Texas (8 points).",
      "Conversely, 36 states and D.C. shifted to the right by less than the weighted average. Those states tended to be less populous and therefore more rural, but also include most of the seven principal swing states in the 2024 race, which had the most concentrated campaign attention and spending during the election. Of those, only Arizona had a larger-than-average shift to the right of 5.8 points, while Nevada's 5.5-point rightward shift was about the same as the weighted average. Beyond that, Michigan swung just 4.2 points to the right, and the other four swing states \u2014 Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2014 all swung right by fewer than 3 points.",
      "Of all the states, Washington state had the smallest swing to the right, going from Biden +19 to Harris +18. The Washington outcome serves as yet another reminder that you should never rely on one data point as an indicator of things to come. After all, Washington's blanket and top-two primary results have often served as a decent predictor for the national political environment in the ensuing November election. But in 2024, Democrats running for the U.S. House of Representatives did better in the state's top-two primaries than they performed in 2020 or 2022, yet the November results saw Republicans nationally do much better than in 2020 and similar to their 2022 result in the national popular vote for the House.",
      "Most counties swung right to a small or medium degree",
      "Naturally, as one party gains more compared to the last election, it tends to gain a larger share of voters across the nation's counties, and county-level data can help us understand the depth and breadth of the swing behind an election's outcome. But a simple count of the number of counties that moved in one direction isn't especially helpful in painting this picture. After all, most counties are rural (and consistently conservative-leaning), but rocks and trees can't vote. Carter's 1976 victory was the last time a Democratic presidential nominee won more counties than the Republican did, yet Democrats have won five of the 12 White House contests since then.",
      "To get a read on the scope of county-level swings, it's more useful to consider the share of the nation's overall vote found in counties that moved toward one party or the other. That way, we better account for the vast differences in population across counties. By this measure, the rightward swing of Trump's 2024 victory featured substantial breadth. Compared with the 2020 election, 92 percent of voters lived in counties (or their equivalents) that swung toward Trump, while only 8 percent lived in places that moved toward Harris. The only recent election to rival that span is Obama's 2008 win, when 92 percent of voters lived in counties that swung to the left from the 2004 election.",
      "Now, the depth of Trump's swing was somewhat shallower than Obama's 2008 win, which isn't necessarily surprising considering 2008 saw a bigger overall swing nationally (9.7 points to the left). More than half of all votes in 2008 came from places that swung at least 10 points to the left by margin. By comparison, only 11 percent of 2024 votes hailed from counties that swung more than 10 points to the right, while 81 percent overall came from counties that shifted between zero and 10 points to the right.",
      "Compared to recent contests besides 2008, though, the broad scope of Trump's gains across much of the country seem striking. The third-biggest swing in the past quarter century after 2008 and 2024 came in 2012, when Obama won reelection but the country as a whole swung 3.4 points to the right. Yet even as much of the country swung slightly to the right that year, about 1 in 4 votes still came from counties that moved at least somewhat to the left. In 2020, we saw a similar story: Biden swung the country about 2.4 points to the left from 2016, but a tad more than 1 in 4 votes came from counties that swung right toward Trump.",
      "Another data point further suggests that the shift from 2020 to 2024 was not just broad, but especially consistent in its impacts across the country. Overall, the correlation between each county's margin in 2020 compared with 2024 was .995 on a scale of -1 to 1 \u2014 a near-perfect positive association between the two elections, and the strongest between the results in any two consecutive presidential elections dating back to 2000. To be clear, this does not mean that the results were the same in each county in 2020 and 2024. Rather, it broadly means that the more Republican a county voted in 2020, the more Republican it tended to vote in 2024.",
      "Although results in other recent pairs of elections have been highly correlated as well, the 2020-24 comparison is particularly notable because such an incredibly strong association happened even while the country swung 6 points to the right. This suggests that, broadly speaking, this ample national swing did not vary massively across the country. By contrast, the sizable 10-point swing to the left in 2008 from 2004 had a county-level correlation of .933, meaning that while the margins across counties were relatively similar, more places still saw some substantial movement that didn't correspond as closely. And in 2016, which saw particularly large county-level swings from 2012 because of the shifting nature of the Democratic and Republican coalitions at the start of the Trump era, the correlation between the two contests was .945.",
      "***",
      "The breadth of the nation's rightward swing could suggest a couple of larger possibilities. Considering 2008 saw the only similarly large national shift in recent times amid financial and global turmoil, the broad swing in 2024 seems to be another point in favor of larger fundamentals-based reasons for the shifts in this election. Dissatisfaction with the economic status quo and immigration, along with high disapproval of the incumbent president, were all clear boons for Trump's candidacy.",
      "At the same time, Trump's gains may have greater resonance moving forward. The relative consistency of the county-level shifts suggests that there weren't major coalition shifts this year, but even minor swings could be a harbinger. Notably, Trump improved most in more urban and more racially diverse places. Odds are that the 2028 election results will be highly correlated with the 2024 results, so even small coalition changes in this election could have a long-term impact on the makeup of the parties and the preferences of voters as we look ahead to future elections.",

    "story": [
      "New Education and the Workforce Committee chair will be elected Thursday.",
      "Republican Rep. Virginia Foxx has reached her final hours as the conference's leader on education policy.",
      "For 20 years, Foxx has served on the House Education and the Workforce Committee. For the last two terms while Republicans were in the majority in the House, she's held the coveted position of chairwoman and was ranking member when Democrats were in control from 2019 until 2021. In fact, the 81-year-old congresswoman was granted a waiver to lead the committee for the 118th Congress because Republicans limit their top committee position to six years.",
      "The Republican Steering Committee will elect the next chair on Thursday.",
      "Foxx told ABC News that her top priority this session was reducing college costs through reauthorizing the Higher Education Act.",
      "Many of the K-12 topics on the former college instructor and community college president's legislative agenda became winning issues for Republicans. Parents' rights, protecting women and girls in sports, and school choice policies -- issues that reached the national stage on the campaign trail this year -- were widely supported by Republicans under Foxx's leadership.",
      "Foxx is known for foiling the Biden administration's signature higher education policies, including his student loan forgiveness program. She's been called a \"hero\" by staffers and a \"force of nature\" by House Speaker Mike Johnson.",
      "\"She has been a very faithful friend to me and a good model for all of us,\" Johnson recalled in an interview with ABC News. \"Her work ethic is incredible. She is so passionate about what she does. She is a force of nature, but she also has a way to balance it with humility,\" Johnson said.",
      "Foxx's dedication to education was exhibited by her committee's crackdown on alleged antisemitism engulfing college campuses over the last year. She spearheaded the collecting of more than 400,000 pages of documents, historic subpoenas for documents and internal communications, and hearings that led to the resignations of Ivy League presidents who failed to protect Jewish students at U.S. universities, according to the committee's wide-reaching report.",
      "\"Our goal was and is to make sure that Jewish students are safe on campus,\" Foxx told ABC News, adding, \"All students should be safe on campus, but it was the Jewish students who were being threatened and harassed and, at times, assaulted.\"",
      "House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik has worked alongside Foxx for the last decade on the committee. Stefanik credits Foxx with being the driving force pushing education to the top of the House's agenda as Johnson took up the antisemitism issue earlier this spring.",
      "\"The great thing about Virginia is she's not going to slow down, and I think she will have other great chapters in Congress, but it's been great to be on the committee with her, and I'm very proud of her, and she is someone that so many people look up to,\" Stefanik told ABC News.",
      "Foxx's work ethic can be traced back to her humble beginning in Avery County, North Carolina, in Appalachia. She told ABC News that she grew up very poor.",
      "\"I just never imagined, in my wildest dreams, being in Congress or having a portrait,\" Foxx said when asked this fall about the painting of her that now hangs in the Education Committee's hearing room on Capitol Hill. \"I grew up in a town with no electricity and no running water.\"",
      "Foxx is now a mentor to her colleagues, including Stefanik and Utah's Burgess Owens.",
      "\"She's a bulldog when it comes down to what she wants to get accomplished and that's what we've needed to actually bring education to the forefront,\" Rep. Owens told ABC News.",
      "A former NFL player, Owens said he admires Foxx's ability to build a team and compared the chairwoman to his legendary head coach Al Davis.",
      "\"I see what Dr. Foxx is doing with education in the same way,\" Owens said. \"I think for the first time, education is becoming a priority, not only for those of us who have a passion for it, but for Americans across the country who just took it for granted,\" he said.",
      "A relative newcomer to the committee, Owens wants to follow in Foxx's footsteps. He is challenging Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Michigan, to succeed Foxx as chair.",
      "Owens told ABC News he's feeling anxious about winning over his colleagues on the committee. Meanwhile, Walberg and Rep. G.T. Thompson of Pennsylvania are the second-longest serving Republicans on the committee behind Foxx. After 16 years, Walberg said he believes he deserves the top position.",
      "Foxx said she has loved chairing the committee, but it's just one of many highlights during her time on the Hill.",
      "\"My greatest achievement comes every day when we help another constituent, so my life isn't just tied up in the committee,\" she said."

The technology we have right now with the deicing vehicles ... we\u2019ve been able to reduce our throughput time on deicing by half and still meeting all the requirements that we need to in terms of adequately deicing the aircraft, but having one person do it.",

      "Jordan Vilchez, who grew up in California and was moved into the Peoples Temple commune at age 14, told The Associated Press in a phone interview from the U.S. that she has mixed feelings about the tour.",
      "She was in Guyana\u2019s capital the day Jones ordered hundreds of his followers to drink a poisoned grape-flavored drink that was given to children first. Her two sisters and two nephews were among the victims.",
      "\u201cI just missed dying by one day,\u201d she recalled.",
      "Vilchez, 67, said Guyana has every right to profit from any plans related to Jonestown.",
      "\u201cThen on the other hand, I just feel like any situation where people were manipulated into their deaths should be treated with respect,\u201d she said.",
      "Vilchez added that she hopes the tour operator would provide context and explain why so many people went to Guyana trusting they would find a better life.",
      "The tour would ferry visitors to the far-flung village of Port Kaituma nestled in the lush jungles of northern Guyana. It\u2019s a trip available only by boat, helicopter or plane; rivers instead of roads connect Guyana\u2019s interior. Once there, it\u2019s another six miles via a rough and overgrown dirt trail to the abandoned commune and former agricultural settlement.",
      "Neville Bissember, a law professor at the University of Guyana, questioned the proposed tour, calling it a \u201cghoulish and bizarre\u201d idea in a recently published letter.",
      "\u201cWhat part of Guyana\u2019s nature and culture is represented in a place where death by mass suicide and other atrocities and human rights violations were perpetuated against a submissive group of American citizens, which had nothing to do with Guyana nor Guyanese?\u201d he wrote.",
      "Despite ongoing criticism, the tour has strong support from the government's Tourism Authority and Guyana\u2019s Tourism and Hospitality Association.",
      "Tourism Minister Oneidge Walrond told the AP the government is backing the effort at Jonestown but is aware \u201cof some level of push back\u201d from certain sectors of society.",
      "She said the government already has helped clear the area \u201cto ensure a better product can be marketed,\u201d adding that the tour might need Cabinet approval.",
      "\u201cIt certainly has my support,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is possible. After all, we have seen what Rwanda has done with that awful tragedy as an example.\u201d",
      "Rose Sewcharran, director of Wonderlust Adventures, the private tour operator who plans to take visitors to Jonestown, said she was buoyed by the support.",
      "\u201cWe think it is about time,\u201d she said. \u201cThis happens all over the world. We have multiple examples of dark, morbid tourism around the world, including Auschwitz and the Holocaust museum.\u201d",
      "The November 1978 mass suicide-murder was synonymous with Guyana for decades until huge amounts of oil and gas were discovered off the country\u2019s coast nearly a decade ago, making it one of the world\u2019s largest offshore oil producers.",
      "New roads, schools and hotels are being built across the capital, Georgetown, and beyond, and a country that rarely saw tourists is now hoping to attract more of them.",
      "An obvious attraction is Jonestown, argued Astill Paul, the co-pilot of a twin-engine plane that flew U.S. Rep. Leo J. Ryan of California and a U.S. news crew to a village near the commune a day before hundreds died on Nov. 18, 1978. He witnessed gunmen fatally shoot Ryan and four others as they tried to board the plane on Nov. 18 and fly back to the capital.",
      "Paul told the AP he believes the former commune should be developed as a heritage site.",
      "\u201cI sat on the tourism board years ago and did suggest we do this, but the minister at the time lashed the idea down because the government wanted nothing to do with morbid tourism,\u201d he recalled.",
      "Until recently, successive governments shunned Jonestown, arguing that the country\u2019s image was badly damaged by the mass murder-suicide, even though only a handful of Indigenous people died. The overwhelming majority of victims were Americans like Vilchez who flew to Guyana to follow Jones. Many endured beatings, forced labor, imprisonment and rehearsals for a mass suicide.",
      "Those in favor of a tour include Gerry Gouveia, a pilot who also flew when Jonestown was active.",
      "\u201cThe area should be reconstructed purely for tourists to get a first-hand understanding of its layout and what had happened,\" he said. \u201cWe should reconstruct the home of Jim Jones, the main pavilion and other buildings that were there.\u201d",
      "Today, all that is left is bits of a cassava mill, pieces of the main pavilion and a rusted tractor that once hauled a flatbed trailer to take temple members to the Port Kaituma airfield.",
      "Until now, most visitors to Jonestown have been reporters and family members of those who died.",
      "Organizing an expedition on one\u2019s own is daunting: the area is far from the capital and hard to access, and some consider the closest populated settlement dangerous.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still a very, very, very rough area,\u201d said Fielding McGehee, co-director of The Jonestown Institute, a nonprofit group. \u201cI don\u2019t see how this is going to be an economically feasible kind of project because of the vast amounts of money it would take to turn it into a viable place to visit.\u201d",
      "McGehee warned about relying on supposed witnesses who will be part of the tour. He said the memories and stories that have trickled down through generations might not be accurate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a game of telephone,\u201d he said. \u201cIt does not help anyone understand what happened in Jonestown.\u201d",
      "He recalled how one survivor had proposed a personal project to develop the abandoned site, but those from the temple community said, \u2018Why do you want to do that?\u2019",
      "McGehee noted that dark tourism is popular, and that going to Jonestown means tourists could say they visited a place where more than 900 people died on the same day.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the prurient interest in tragedy,\u201d he said.",
      "If the tour eventually starts operating, not everything will be visible to tourists.",
      "When Vilchez returned to Guyana in 2018 for the first time since the mass suicide-murder, she made an offering to the land when she arrived in Jonestown.",
      "Among the things she buried in the abandoned commune where her sisters and nephews died were snippets of hair from her mother and father, who did not go to Jonestown.",
      "\u201cIt just felt like a gesture that honored the people that died,\u201d she said.",

    "summary": "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is capping the fees at $5 with a rule set to take effect in October 2025, if it isn't overturned by Congress or altered under a Trump administration",
    "story": [
      "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is capping the fees at $5 with a rule set to take effect in October 2025, if it isn't overturned by Congress or altered under a Trump administration",
      "NEW YORK -- The Biden administration has finalized a rule limiting overdraft fees banks can charge, as part of the White House's campaign to reduce junk fees that hit consumers on everyday purchases, including banking services. President Joe Biden had called the fees, which can be as high as $35, \u201cexploitative,\u201d while the banking industry has lobbied extensively to keep the existing fee structures in place.",
      "Under the finalized rule, banks will be able to choose from three options: they may charge a flat overdraft fee of $5, they may charge a fee that covers their costs and losses, or they may charge any fee so long as they disclose the terms of the overdraft loan the way they would for any other loan, typically expressed as an annual percentage rate, or APR.",
      "While banks have cut back on overdraft fees in the past decade, the nation\u2019s biggest banks still take in roughly $8 billion in the charges every year, according to data from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and bank public records. Currently, there is no cap on the overdraft fees that banks can legally charge.",
      "Right now, when a bank temporarily lends a consumer money when their account has reached a zero balance, the consumer is typically responsible for paying back both the overdrawn amount and an additional fee, which can be more than the original amount charged. In one example often cited by opponents of the fees, a $3 cup of coffee can end up costing someone more than $30.",
      "The finalized rule is set to take effect in October 2025, but the incoming Trump administration has yet to tap anyone to lead the CFPB, and has mentioned the idea of eliminating the agency.",
      "The finalized rule applies to banks and credit unions that have more than $10 billion in assets, which includes the nation\u2019s largest banks. Banks have previously sued the CFPB over these rules and caps on credit card late fees, and are likely to sue again. Congress also has the ability to challenge or overturn the rule.",
      "Overdraft fees originated during a time when consumers wrote and cashed checks more frequently \u2014 so that the checks would clear instead of bouncing, if there was an issue of timing \u2014 but banks steadily increased the fees in the first two decades of the 2000s. The fees disproportionately affect banks\u2019 most cash-strapped consumers. A majority of overdrafts (70%) are charged to customers with average account balances between $237 and $439, according to the CFPB.",
      "The agency estimates the new rule would save consumers about $5 billion in annual overdraft fees, or $225 per household that typically experiences the fees.",

In July, he posted a message on his own social network Truth Social threatening to send election fraudsters to prison in part by citing a nickname he used for the Meta CEO. \u201cZUCKERBUCKS, be careful!\u201d Trump wrote.",

In 2022 and 2023, the Fed raised its key short-term rate 11 times \u2014 to a two-decade high \u2014 in a drive to reverse an inflationary surge that followed the economy's unexpectedly strong recovery from the COVID-19 recession. The steady cooling of inflation led the central bank, starting in the fall, to begin reversing that move.",
      "In September, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate, which affects many consumer and business loans, by a sizable half-point. It followed that move with a quarter-point rate cut in November. Those cuts lowered the central bank\u2019s key rate to 4.6%, down from a four-decade high of 5.3%.",
      "The producer price index released Thursday can offer an early look at where consumer inflation might be headed. Economists also watch it because some of its components, notably healthcare and financial services, flow into the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge \u2014 the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, index.",
      "Despite the overall uptick in producer prices, Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics noted in a commentary that the components that feed into the PCE index were \u201cuniversally weak\" in November and make it even more likely that the Fed will cut its benchmark rate next week.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s forthcoming agenda has raised concerns about the future path of inflation and whether the Fed will continue to cut rates. Though Trump has vowed to force prices down, in part by encouraging oil and gas drilling, some of his other campaign vows \u2014 to impose massive taxes on imports, for example, and to deport millions of immigrants working illegally in the United States \u2014 are widely seen as inflationary.",
      "Still, Wall Street traders foresee a 98% likelihood of a third Fed rate cut next week, according to the CME FedWatch tool."

      "Civic engagement nonprofits believe democracy is an exercise in need of constant support \u2014 not just extra money around major major campaigns",
      "NEW YORK -- A nonprofit law group dedicated to protecting the rights of Southern voters of color had more on its plate this year than just the 2024 presidential election.",
      "The Southern Coalition for Social Justice hosts voter registration drives and monitors election certification. Staff attorneys help run a legal hotline for voting irregularities. Teams challenge electoral maps and restrictive laws deemed unfair. It's costly, year-round work that senior counsel Mitchell Brown considers vital to participatory democracy \u2014 but also work that gets less attention outside of high-profile campaign cycles.",
      "\u201cA lot of people exert a lot of energy during the presidential year and it falls off for the next three to four years,\" Brown said. \"That can\u2019t happen. Because there\u2019s a lot of changes that are occurring in between those four years between presidential elections.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are no more off years anymore,\" he added.",
      "The coalition benefited this spring from a progressive philanthropic network organized around the belief that democracy is an exercise \u2014 not a given \u2014 in need of constant support. Led by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar\u2019s Democracy Fund, petitioners pledged to reverse existing boom-and-bust dynamics where money floods politically engaged nonprofits late into election years only to dry up afterward. Beginning with the \u201cAll by April\u201d campaign to move money early, the effort is continuing with the \u201cElection Day to Every Day\u201d push to shore up next year's funding.",
      "However, according to interviews with other nonprofit leaders in the left-leaning civic space, the philanthropic sector at large has not heeded the call. For the nonprofit leaders experiencing budgets as usual, the anticipated pattern of funding drop-offs is raising stakes many leaders felt were already heightened by the fraught political climate.",
      "With reported security threats and staff burnout, Democracy Fund President Joe Goldman said it's especially inefficient to spend millions training people, developing skills and creating a knowledge base only to cut nonprofit budgets and \"throw it away.\u201d Despite what Democracy Fund said was widespread agreement that democracy is under threat, the organization found that many funders had no plans before September to help grantees prepare for the post-election environment.",
      "\u201cWe need to show them that we've got their backs,\" Goldman said.",
      "Grassroots nonprofits \u2014 both \u201c501(c)3\" groups, named after the tax code section they were organized under, which are restricted from party politics altogether, and \u201c501(c)4\" organizations, which are allowed limited partisan activity \u2014 believe their bottom-up approach positions them well to engage their communities in local politics.",
      "That might take the form of deep canvassing. Unlike political canvassers who knock on doors and call numbers to sway votes, deep canvassers have longer conversations with strangers about their concerns and desires. The idea is to form connections that eventually change hearts and minds on divisive topics. Or, it might look like mobilizing residents around single issues in their backyards.",
      "Groups that spent 2020 doing such work felt drained afterward, according to Women Donors Network President Leena Barakat, whose group signed the Election Day to Every Day petition. The election had high turnout. But money and energy were depleted, she said, and there was scant capacity for sustaining political engagement with democratic processes. By the time 2024 rolled around, many civically-minded nonprofits were still playing catch up with their staffing levels. Any financial windfall this year wouldn\u2019t have been enough to effectively organize in just six months.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t show up for just an election day. They are there to really understand and meet the needs of their community year-round,\u201d said Women Donors Network President Leena Barakat, whose group signed the Election Day to Every Day petition. \u201cTo just fund them around elections is incredibly transactional and less effective in the work that we are trying to do. Change moves at the speed of trust.\u201d",
      "The effort's proponents suggest financial backing to form those ties is limited in part because the work goes unseen to funders. Philanthropists tend to prefer projects that can be measured easily and quickly, the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy Senior Research Manager Katherine Ponce noted. But Ponce said the work of relationship development and trust building is difficult to quantify and happens slowly.",
      "Explicitly electoral work understandably gets a lot of resources during election years, according to Alice Evans of the Southeast Immigrant Rights Network. It makes sense to focus on efforts like get-out-the-vote events, she said, but it also makes it harder for SIRN to support what she called \u201cvery democracy-related work.\u201d The nonprofit coalition of more than 50 immigrant- and refugee-led groups provides leadership trainings for the heads of immigration-focused organizations and \u201cKnow Your Rights\u201d toolkits for their communities.",
      "Evans, who oversees fundraising, said she is bracing for organizing conditions to grow \u201cmore hostile\u201d under the incoming Trump administration; SIRN is preparing a \u201crapid response fund\u201d in anticipation of immigration crackdowns.",
      "\u201cIn order for a democracy to function and be healthy, we need people understanding their rights,\" Evans said. \"Understanding and taking up their part in co-creating democracy. And instead, I think often these days, it feels like we often understand democracy as this transactional thing that we sort of receive.\u201d",
      "DoSomething is a nonprofit that encourages youth participation by providing opportunities to volunteer and organize. But DoSomething CEO DeNora Getachew said funders told her that youth are not a strategic investment despite 41 million Gen Z members being eligible to vote this year.",
      "Money flowed across the philanthropic sector during the first half of the year, DoSomething Vice President of Development Katie Tynes said, but the overall spigot seemed to tighten in the second half. Tynes said she also saw funding shift from 501(c)3s to 501(c)4s. While there\u2019s room for both types of tax-exempt organizations, she said, it was troubling because the former tend to do more people-centered work on the ground whereas the latter have more political agendas.",
      "Speaking anecdotally, Getachew said she saw a decline this year in funding for nonprofit groups like hers focused on evergreen civic engagement.",
      "\u201cThis very cyclical, very transactional rush to register young people to vote, get them to turn out to vote and then bid them adieu in those in-between years \u2014 if we don't develop the civic muscle of young people early and then ensure that they practice that muscle consistently, I think we're going to have a big challenge with the viability of our democracy long-term,\u201d she said.",
      "Still, the \u201cAll by April\u201d campaign claimed some success. Democracy Fund reported sparking $79 million in new 501(c)3 grants for election-related work and $61 million in money disbursed sooner than planned. Brown said the Southern Coalition for Social Justice was able to hire three new attorneys with the influx of donations spurred by the springtime push to provide funding earlier into the election cycle.",
      "But two of them are fellows, he said, and SCSJ has an expanded docket of redistricting cases to maintain.",

    "summary": "U.N. experts say there has been a slight drop in the production of opium in Myanmar, the world&rsquo;s biggest source of the illicit drug from which heroin is derived, but warn there are still strong prospects for future expansion of the deadly trade",
    "story": [
      "U.N. experts say there has been a slight drop in the production of opium in Myanmar, the world\u2019s biggest source of the illicit drug from which heroin is derived, but warn there are still strong prospects for future expansion of the deadly trade",
      "BANGKOK -- There has been a slight drop in the production of opium in Myanmar, the world\u2019s biggest source of the illicit drug from which heroin is derived, experts from the United Nations said Thursday, while warning of strong prospects for future expansion of the deadly trade.",
      "The Myanmar Opium Survey 2024 issued by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime says that after three consecutive years of growth, the area where opium is cultivated fell by 4% to 45,200 hectares (111,700 acres) and production decreased by 8% to 995 metric tons due to a 4% decline in opium yield.",
      "UNODC announced last year that Myanmar had overtaken Afghanistan to become the world\u2019s top opium producer, saying a ban imposed by the ruling Taliban after its 2021 takeover led to a 95% drop there in opium cultivation. Opium, the base from which morphine and heroin are produced, is harvested from poppy flowers.",
      "Meanwhile, Myanmar registered growth in cultivation and production from 2021 through 2023, which UNODC attributed largely to",
      "fostered by the crisis that arose after its army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021. Resistance to the takeover has led to what is now a civil war.",
      "Many farmers who had left opium behind during the period of relative stability before the military takeover returned to growing opium, Masood Karimipour, UNODC Regional Representative for Southeast Asia and the Pacific, said at a press briefing about the survey, which utilized both on-the-ground investigations and satellite surveillance.",
      "The consequences of the supply shakeup remain unclear, UNODC experts said.",
      "\u201cWe believe that at the moment the global supply chain for heroin has not been fully adjusted,\u201d said Inshik Sim, a UNODC Research Officer, \u201cAnd there is an implication that because there is a lack of heroin at the global level, somebody has to fill the markets and that may push the Myanmar opium poppy farmers to increasingly engage in opium poppy cultivation.\u201d",
      "In 2024, however, UNODC says the fighting at the heart of the instability intensified so much that it may have constrained production, due to factors including displacement and restrictions on movement, as appears to be the case in the opium-producing regions of Shan and Kachin in eastern and northern Myanmar.",
      "That does not necessarily mean production has plateaued, said the U.N. experts.",
      "\u201cTroublingly, we are seeing indicators that the expanding and intensifying conflict in Myanmar is also a growing concern,\u201d said Karimipour. \u201dSo as the situation in Myanmar remains volatile and as the governance and humanitarian crises there continue, we may again see more people pushed into opium cultivation.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd we also note that the farmers have reported to us that their number one reason is just to put food on the table and that economic need will continue to intensify and worsen. So we don\u2019t predict an alleviation in the motivation to continue to grow opium.\u201d",
      "\"It\u2019s very important for the international community to do what it can to support farming communities, to build resilience outside the opium economy, as the push factors that we\u2019ve just discussed will continue,\" Karimipour said, adding that, \u201cand it\u2019s important to continue monitoring the situation in both Myanmar and Afghanistan as it relates to the global heroin supply chains.\u201d",
      "Northeastern Myanmar is part of the infamous \u201cGolden Triangle,\u201d where the borders of Myanmar, Laos and Thailand meet. The production of opium and heroin historically flourished there, largely because of the lawlessness in border areas where Myanmar\u2019s central government has been able to exercise only minimum control over various ethnic minority militias, some of them partners in the drug trade.",
      "In recent decades, after the region\u2019s opium production had dropped, methamphetamine in the form of tablets and crystal meth supplanted it. It\u2019s easier to make on an industrial scale than the labor-intensive cultivation of opium, and gets distributed by land, sea and air around Asia and the Pacific."

      "But when Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, appeared initially cool to the nomination of President-elect Donald Trump \u2019s choice of Pete Hegseth to serve as defense secretary \u2014 a man who once said women should not serve in combat and who has himself been accused of sexual assault \u2014 she faced an onslaught of criticism from within her own party, including threats of a potential primary challenge in 2026.",
      "\u201cThe American people spoke,\u201d said Bob Vander Plaats, president and CEO of the Family Leader and a conservative activist in Ernst\u2019s home state.",
      "\u201cWhen you sign up for this job, it\u2019s a big boy and big girl job, and she\u2019s feeling the pressure of people vocalizing their disappointment, their concern with how she\u2019s handling this.\u201d",
      "The pressure campaign against Ernst, once a rising member of the GOP leadership, shows there is little room in Trump\u2019s party for those who can\u2019t get to yes on Hegseth or any of his other picks for his incoming administration",
      "It underscores the power Trump is expected to wield on Capitol Hill in a second term and serves as a warning to other lawmakers who may be harboring their own concerns about other Trump selections, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for health secretary and Tulsi Gabbard to be director of national intelligence.",
      "\u201cIf the king wants a different senator from Iowa, we\u2019ll have one. If he doesn\u2019t, we won\u2019t,\u201d said Iowa talk show host Steve Deace, suggesting on his show Monday that he would be willing to jump in against Ernst if Trump wanted a challenger. \u201cI think someone\u2019s got to be made an example out of, whether it\u2019s Joni or someone else.\u201d",
      "People close to Ernst, a retired Army National Guard lieutenant colonel, stress her mettle and say her eventual decision will depend on her assessment of Hegseth, a former \u201cFox & Friends Weekend\u201d host and veteran, and nothing else.",
      "\u201cHas there been Twitter pressure? Sure. But Joni\u2019s a combat veteran. She\u2019s not easily pressured,\u201d said David Kochel, an Iowa Republican strategist and longtime Ernst friend and adviser.",
      "Ernst has worked steadily to shore up her relationship with Trump after declining to endorse him before the Iowa caucuses that kicked off this year's campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. During a recent visit to Mar-a-Lago, Trump's Florida club, she met with Trump and billionaire Elon Musk with ideas for their budget-slashing Department of Government Efficiency. She heads up a newly formed DOGE caucus in the Senate.",
      "Trump has not tried personallty to pressure Ernst to back Hegseth, according to a person familiar with their conversations who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose them. And he has not targeted her \u2014 or any potential holdouts \u2014 publicly in social media posts.",
      "He also hasn't had to.",
      "The response to Ernst built quickly, first in whispers following her initially cool remarks after meeting with Hegseth, then into a pile-on from powerful figures in the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement.",
      "Only about 2 in 10 Americans approve of Hegseth\u2019s nomination, according to Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs polling. About one-third of Republicans approve of him as a pick, and 16% disapprove. Another 1 in 10 Republicans, roughly, are neutral and say they neither approve nor disapprove.",
      "Trump allies had been concerned that a successful effort to derail Hegseth\u2019s candidacy would empower opposition to other nominees, undermining his projections of complete dominance of the party. In the narrowly held Senate, with a 53-47 GOP majority in the new year, any Trump nominee can only afford a few Republican \u201cno\u201d votes if all Democrats are opposed.",
      "Those piling on included Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who warned that Ernst\u2019s political career was \u201cin serious jeopardy\" and that primary challengers stood at the ready.",
      "One social media post from the CEO of The Federalist featured side-by-side photos comparing Ernst to ousted Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., whom Trump recently said deserves to be jailed, along with other members of the House committee that investigated the Capitol riot.",
      "Building America\u2019s Future, a conservative nonprofit, announced plans to spend half a million dollars supporting Trump's pick of Hegseth, the Daily Caller first reported. The group has already spent thousands on Facebook and Instagram ads featuring Ernst\u2019s photo and is running a commercial urging viewers to call their senators to back him.",
      "Criticism mounted at home, too. Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird, who quickly endeared herself to Trump when she became the highest-ranking state official to endorse him ahead of this year\u2019s caucuses, wrote an op-ed for the conservative Breitbart news site that was seen as a not-so-subtle warning.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re witnessing in Washington right now is a Deep State attempt to undermine the will of the people,\" she wrote.",
      "Local Republican groups also encouraged Iowans to call Ernst\u2019s office and urged her to back Trump's picks.",
      "While incumbents have particular staying power in Iowa, Trump has a track record of ending the careers of those who cross him.",
      "Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller defended the tactics.",
      "\u201cRight now, this is President Trump\u2019s party,\u201d he said Tuesday at The Wall Street Journal's CEO Council Summit in Washington. \u201cI think voters want to see the president being able to put in his people.\u201d",
      "Ernst has gradually appeared to soften on Hegseth. By Monday, after meeting with him once again, she issued a statement saying they had had \u201cencouraging conversations.\u201d",

      "\u201cAs I support Pete through this process, I look forward to a fair hearing based on truth, not anonymous sources,\u201d she said.",

She was reelected in 2022 after beating a Trump-endorsed challenger.",

      "WASHINGTON -- As several of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s choices for high-level positions in his incoming administration face scrutiny on Capitol Hill, a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that Americans have their own doubts.",
      "Relatively few Americans overall approve of Pete Hegseth, Trump's choice to lead the Department of Defense, or Tulsi Gabbard, his pick for intelligence chief, although a substantial share doesn\u2019t know who those figures are. The other selections who were included in the poll, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for health secretary and Marco Rubio for secretary of state, are more well-known but not much more popular among Americans overall.",
      "Trump and his allies are pushing Republican senators to confirm his picks, who are meeting with lawmakers before Trump returns to the White House next month. Given the Republicans' slim majority in the Senate, the stakes are high for each Trump pick.",
      "An Army veteran and former Fox News commentator, Hegseth has been trying to make his case amid allegations of excessive drinking and the revelation that he made a settlement payment after being accused of a sexual assault that he denies. Trump has reiterated his support for Hegseth, who appears to have won over some of the senators who were once critical of his selection.",
      "Hegseth is still an unknown quantity for many Americans. About 4 in 10 don't know enough about him to give an opinion, according to the poll. But his selection is viewed more negatively than positively among Americans who do know who he is. About 2 in 10 U.S. adults approve of Hegseth being picked for Trump's Cabinet, while 36% disapprove and about 1 in 10 don't know enough to have an opinion.",
      "He has higher support among Republicans, but it's not overwhelming. Many Republicans do not have an opinion of Hegseth: About 4 in 10 say they don\u2019t know enough about him. About one-third of Republicans approve of him as a pick, and 16% disapprove. Another 1 in 10 Republicans, roughly, are neutral and say they neither approve nor disapprove.",
      "Those approval numbers among Republicans are at least slightly lower for Hegseth than any of the other names included in the poll.",
      "Gabbard, who represented Hawaii in the House for four terms as a Democrat, sought the 2020 presidential nomination before leaving her party. She was one of Trump's most sought-after surrogates in the 2024 campaign. Gabbard has faced new questions about her proximity to Syria amid the sudden end  of Syrian President Bashar Assad's long hold on power.",
      "Gabbard is as unknown as Hegseth is, but Americans are a little less likely to disapprove of her nomination. About 2 in 10 Americans approve of Trump's pick of Gabbard, while about 3 in 10 disapprove. The rest either do not know enough to say \u2014 about 4 in 10 said this \u2014 or have a neutral view.",
      "Approval is slightly higher among Republicans than Hegseth's, though. About 4 in 10 Republicans approve of the choice, while very few disapprove and 16% have a neutral view. Similar to Americans overall, about 4 in 10 Republicans don't know enough to say.",
      "A scion of a famous Democratic dynasty, Kennedy made a name in his own right as an environmental attorney who successfully took on large corporations. In recent decades, he has increasingly devoted his energy to promoting claims about vaccines that contradict the overwhelming consensus of scientists. Trump has said he would give Kennedy free rein over health policy \u2014 from drug, vaccine and food safety to medical research and the social safety net programs Medicare and Medicaid.",
      "Only 14% of Americans say they don't know enough to have an opinion about Trump's move to name Kennedy, but that greater name recognition doesn't translate into warmer feelings. About 4 in 10 Americans disapprove of Trump's selection of Kennedy, while about 3 in 10 approve and 14% are neutral.",

      "The honors for the businessman-turned-politician are a measure of Trump's remarkable comeback from an ostracized former president who refused to accept his election loss four years ago to a president-elect who won the White House decisively in November.",
      "Before he rang the opening bell at 9:30 a.m., a first for him, Trump spoke at the exchange and called it \u201ca tremendous honor.\u201d",
      "\u201cTime magazine, getting this honor for the second time, I think I like it better this time actually,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump, accompanied by his wife, Melania Trump, daughters Ivanka and Tiffany and Vice President-elect JD Vance, grinned as people chanted \u201cUSA\u201d before he opened the trading day. He then raised his fist.",
      "In his remarks, he talked up some of the people he has named to his incoming administration, including Treasury pick Scott Bessent, and some of his announced policies, including a promise this week that the federal government will issue expedited permits, including environmental approvals, for projects and construction worth more than $1 billion.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re going to have a tremendous run. We have to straighten out some problems, some big problems in the world,\u201d he said.",
      "Sam Jacobs, Time's editor in chief, announced on NBC's \u201cToday\u201d show that Trump was Time\u2019s 2024 Person of the Year. Jacobs said Trump was someone who \u201cfor better or for worse, had the most influence on the news in 2024.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is someone who made an historic comeback, who reshaped the American presidency and who\u2019s reordering American politics,\" Jacobs said. \"It\u2019s hard to argue with the fact that the person who\u2019s moving into the Oval Office is the most influential person in news.\"",
      "In an interview with the magazine published Thursday, Trump spoke about his final campaign blitz and election win.",

      "The NYSE regularly invites celebrities and business leaders to participate in the 9:30 a.m. ceremonial opening trading. Thursday will be Trump's first time doing the honors, which have become a marker of culture and politics.",
      "Trump has long had a fascination with being on the cover of Time, where he first made an appearance in 1989. He has falsely claimed to hold the record for cover appearances, and The Washington Post reported in 2017 that Trump had a fake picture of himself on the cover of the magazine hanging in several of his golf country clubs.",

      "Trump said he would not ask members of his administration to sign a loyalty pledge. \u201cI think I will be able to, for the most part, determine who\u2019s loyal,\u201d he said. But he said he will fire anyone who doesn\u2019t follow his policies.",
      "On the war in Gaza, Trump said he wants to end the conflict and that Netanyahu knows it. When Trump was asked whether he trusted Netanyahu, he told Time: \u201cI don\u2019t trust anybody.\u201d",

      "Trump crafted his image as a wealthy real estate developer, which he played up as the star of the TV reality show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d and during his presidential campaign.

    "published": "Thu, 12 Dec 2024 09:46:23 -0500",
    "summary": "President Joe Biden is commuting the sentences of roughly 1,500 people who were released from prison and placed on home confinement during the coronavirus pandemic and pardoning 39 Americans convicted of nonviolent crimes",
    "story": [
      "President Joe Biden is commuting the sentences of roughly 1,500 people who were released from prison and placed on home confinement during the coronavirus pandemic and pardoning 39 Americans convicted of nonviolent crimes",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden is commuting the sentences of roughly 1,500 people who were released from prison and placed on home confinement during the coronavirus pandemic and is pardoning 39 Americans convicted of nonviolent crimes. It's the largest single-day act of clemency in modern history.",
      "The commutations announced Thursday are for people who have served out home confinement sentences for at least one year after they were released. Prisons were uniquely bad for spreading the virus and some inmates were released in part to stop the spread. At one point, 1 in 5 prisoners had COVID-19, according to a tally kept by The Associated Press.",
      "Biden said he would be taking more steps in the weeks ahead and would continue to review clemency petitions. The second largest single-day act of clemency was by Barack Obama, with 330, shortly before leaving office in 2017.",
      "\u201cAmerica was built on the promise of possibility and second chances,\u201d Biden said in a statement. \u201cAs president, I have the great privilege of extending mercy to people who have demonstrated remorse and rehabilitation, restoring opportunity for Americans to participate in daily life and contribute to their communities, and taking steps to remove sentencing disparities for non-violent offenders, especially those convicted of drug offenses.\u201d",
      "The clemency follows a broad pardon for his son Hunter, who was prosecuted for gun and tax crimes. Biden is under pressure from advocacy groups to pardon broad swaths of people, including those on federal death row, before the Trump administration takes over in January. He\u2019s also weighing whether to issue preemptive pardons to those who investigated Trump\u2019s effort to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and are facing possible retribution when he takes office.",
      "Clemency is the term for the power the president has to pardon, in which a person is relieved of guilt and punishment, or to commute a sentence, which reduces or eliminates the punishment but doesn\u2019t exonerate the wrongdoing. It\u2019s customary for a president to grant mercy at the end of his term, using the power of the office to wipe away records or end prison terms.",
      "Those pardoned Thursday had been convicted of nonviolent crimes such as drug offenses and turned their lives around, White House lawyers said. They include a woman who led emergency response teams during natural disasters; a church deacon who has worked as an addiction counselor and youth counselor; a doctoral student in molecular biosciences; and a decorated military veteran.",
      "The president had previously issued 122 commutations and 21 other pardons. He's also broadly pardoned those convicted of use and simple possession of marijuana on federal lands and in the District of Columbia, and pardoned former U.S. service members convicted of violating a now-repealed military ban on consensual gay sex.",
      "Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., and 34 other lawmakers are urging the president to pardon environmental and human rights lawyer Steven Donziger, who was imprisoned or under house arrest for three years because of a contempt of court charge related to his work representing Indigenous farmers in a lawsuit against Chevron.",
      "Others are advocating for Biden to commute the sentences of federal death row prisoners. His attorney general, Merrick Garland, paused federal executions. Biden had said on the campaign trail in 2020 that he wanted to end the death penalty but he never did, and now, with Trump coming back into office, it\u2019s likely executions will resume. During his first term, Trump presided over an unprecedented number of federal executions, carried out during the height of the pandemic.",
      "More clemency grants are coming before Biden leaves office on Jan. 20, but it's not clear whether he'll take action to guard against possible prosecution by Trump, an untested use of the power. The president has been taking the idea seriously and has been thinking about it for as much as six months \u2014 before the presidential election \u2014 but has been concerned about the precedent it would set, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions.",
      "But those who received the pardons would have to accept them. New California Sen. Adam Schiff, who was a part of the House committee that investigated the violent Jan. 6 insurrection, said such a pardon from Biden would be \u201cunnecessary,\u201d and that the president shouldn\u2019t be spending his waning days in office worrying about this.",
      "For Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., another target of Trump's threats, said in a statement this week that his suggestion that she and others be jailed for the investigations \"is a continuation of his assault on the rule of law and the foundations of our republic.\u201d",
      "Before pardoning his son, Biden had repeatedly pledged not to do so. He said in a statement explaining his reversal that the prosecution had been poisoned by politics. The decision prompted criminal justice advocates and lawmakers to put additional public pressure on the administration to use that same power for everyday Americans. It wasn\u2019t a very popular move; only about 2 in 10 Americans approved of his decision, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research."

      "The weather improved so much Wednesday that meteorologists said all red flag warnings, which indicate conditions for high fire danger and the notorious Santa Ana winds, were discontinued. The conditions allowed firefighters to have \u201ca lot of success\u201d despite the nearly inaccessible terrain, CalFire Assistant Chief Dusty Martin said.",
      "Still, some 20,000 residents remained under evacuation orders and warnings Wednesday evening from the blaze, dubbed the Franklin Fire, which was only 7% contained over 6 square miles (16 square kilometers).",
      "It\u2019s unclear how the blaze started. Officials said nine structures had been destroyed and at least six others had been damaged, though crews had only surveyed about 25% of the affected area, said Deputy Chief Albert Yanagisawa of the Los Angeles County Fire Department.",
      "Much of the devastation occurred in Malibu, a community of about 10,000 people on the western edge of Los Angeles known for its stunning bluffs and Zuma Beach, which features in many Hollywood films.",
      "Flames burned near horse farms, celebrities\u2019 seaside mansions, and Pepperdine University, where students were forced to shelter in place on campus for a second night Tuesday.",
      "Faculty members are determining how best to complete the semester, which ends at Pepperdine this week. Final exams were postponed or canceled, depending on the class, university spokesperson Michael Friel said. An early analysis showed little to no damage to structures on campus, the university said.",
      "Lonnie Vidaurri\u2019s four-bedroom home in the Malibu Knolls neighborhood is one of those destroyed. After evacuating to a hotel in Santa Monica with his wife and two young daughters, a neighbor called to tell Vidaurri that firefighters would need to break into his house.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty torched all around,\u201d Vidaurri said. He expects that the family\u2019s pet bunnies did not survive the fire, and that they lost most of their things. \u201cMy girls cried, obviously, but it could have been worse.\u201d",

      "The fire erupted shortly before 11 p.m. Monday and swiftly moved south, jumping over the famous Pacific Coast Highway and extending all the way to the ocean. It was propelled by Santa Ana winds, with gusts that reached 40 mph (64 kph). Santa Anas are notorious seasonal winds that blow dry air from the interior toward the coast, pushing back moist ocean breezes.",
      "Alec Gellis stayed behind Monday night to save his home in Malibu\u2019s Serra Retreat neighborhood from the flames. He used pumps in the home\u2019s swimming pool to help spray water over the house and surrounding vegetation, turning the lush area \u201cinto a rainforest.\u201d",

      "Oregon lawmakers are convening for a special session to discuss emergency wildfire funding after a record wildfire season in the state",
      "SALEM, Ore. -- Oregon lawmakers are convening Thursday for a special session to discuss emergency funding to pay out millions in unpaid bills stemming from the state\u2019s 2024 record wildfire season.",
      "As wildfires still rage in California, Oregon is among several states grappling with steep costs related to fighting wildfires this year. New Mexico lawmakers in a July special session approved millions in emergency aid for wildfire victims, and states including North Dakota and Wyoming have requested federal disaster declarations to help with recovery costs.",
      "Fighting the blazes that scorched a record 1.9 million acres (769,000 hectares), or nearly 2,970 square miles (7,692 square kilometers), largely in eastern Oregon, cost the state over $350 million, according to Gov. Tina Kotek. The sum has made it the most expensive wildfire season in state history, her office said.",
      "While over half of the costs will eventually be covered by the federal government, the state still needs to pay the bills while waiting to be reimbursed.",
      "\u201cThe unprecedented 2024 wildfire season required all of us to work together to protect life, land, and property, and that spirit of cooperation must continue in order to meet our fiscal responsibilities,\u201d Kotek said in a late November news release announcing the special session.",
      "Oregon wildfires this year destroyed at least 42 homes and burned large swaths of range and grazing land in the state\u2019s rural east. At one point, the Durkee Fire, which scorched roughly 460 square miles (1,200 square kilometers) near the Oregon-Idaho border, was the largest in the nation.",
      "Kotek declared a state of emergency in July in response to the threat of wildfire, and invoked the state\u2019s Emergency Conflagration Act a record 17 times during the season.",
      "For the special session, Kotek has asked lawmakers to approve $218 million for the Oregon Department of Forestry and the Oregon Department of the State Fire Marshal. The money would help the agencies continue operations and pay the contractors that helped to fight the blazes and provide resources.",
      "The special session comes ahead of the start of the next legislative session in January, when lawmakers will be tasked with finding more permanent revenue streams for wildfire costs that have ballooned with climate change worsening drought conditions across the U.S. West.",
      "In the upcoming legislative session, Kotek wants lawmakers to increase wildfire readiness and mitigation funding by $130 million in the state\u2019s two-year budget cycle going forward. She has also requested that $150 million be redirected from being deposited in the state\u2019s rainy day fund, on a one-time basis, to fire agencies to help them pay for wildfire suppression efforts.",
      "While Oregon\u2019s 2024 wildfire season was a record in terms of cost and acreage burned, that of 2020 remains historic for being among the worst natural disasters in Oregon\u2019s history. The 2020 Labor Day weekend fires killed nine people and destroyed upward of 5,000 homes and other structures."

      "The latest figures from the most comprehensive survey of American life compare the years 2014-2018 and 2019-2023, timeframes before the COVID-19 pandemic and during the virus' spread. The American Community Survey data show how lives were changed and family relationships altered by the pandemic and other occurrences like the opioid crisis.",
      "The survey of 3.5 million households covers more than 40 topics, including ancestry, fertility, marital status, commutes, veterans status, disability and housing.",
      "The decrease in grandparents' taking care of their grandchildren is most likely because opioid-related deaths stabilized and then declined during the more recent timeframe since substance abuse is a leading reason grandparents find themselves raising grandchildren. A reduction in the number of incarcerated women also likely played a role, said Susan Kelley, a professor emerita of nursing at Georgia State University.",
      "\u201cIt's very rarely for positive reasons that grandparents find themselves in this situation. Usually, it's a tragic situation in an adult child's life \u2014 either a death, incarceration or mental health issues which correlate with substance abuse,\" Kelley said. \"Many grandparents thrive in that role, but there are still socioeconomic and emotional burdens on the grandparents.\"",
      "A stronger economy in the most recent period also may be a reason the number of grandparents living with their grandchildren declined from 7.2 million to 6.8 million by making it less likely that adult children with their own children were seeking housing help from their parents, she said.",
      "The decline in the number of young children enrolled in preschool stemmed from an unwillingness to send young children to school and the closure of many schools at the height of the pandemic, according to the Census Bureau.",
      "\u201cThese data show how the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on patterns of early childhood education,\u201d the bureau said in a separate report. \"Future research will show if this was the start of a long-term trend or if enrollment will bounce back to prior levels.\"",
      "Americans continued to get older, with the median age rising to 38.7 from 37.9 and the nation's share of senior citizens hitting 16.8% from 15.2%. The share of households with a computer jumped to almost 95% from nearly 89%, as did the share of households with a broadband connection to almost 90% from 80%.",
      "Additionally, fewer people moved and more people stayed put in the most recent time period compared with the earlier one, in many cases because of rising home values and the limited availability of homes to buy.",
      "Home values increased by 21.7% and the percentage of vacant homes dropped from 12.2% to 10.4%. The median home value jumped from $249,400 to $303,400 nationwide.",
      "In some vacation communities popular with the wealthy, the bump was even more dramatic, such as in the county that is home to Aspen, Colorado, where it went from $758,800 to $1.1 million, and in the county which is home to Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, where it jumped from $812,400 to $1.1 million.",

    "published": "Thu, 12 Dec 2024 09:00:41 GMT",
    "summary": "Energy firms will be forced to offer the new tariffs under a proposed shake-up of bills by the regulator.",
    "story": [
      "Energy firms will be forced to offer customers tariffs with no standing charges, under a proposed shake-up of bills by regulator Ofgem.",
      "All households pay the fixed daily charges covering the costs of connecting to a supply, but there have been widespread calls for these fees to be scrapped.",
      "Ofgem is proposing suppliers offer one price-capped tariff that includes the standing charge, and another that loads these costs on energy usage charges instead. Customers could choose which suits them best.",
      "The planned overhaul, for next winter, also raises the possibility of some unpaid bills that built up during a recent high-price crisis to be written off.",
      "Standing charge anger",
      "When Ofgem asked for the public's views on standing charges it received an unprecedented response of 30,000 submissions.",
      "The majority were against standing charges - fixed fees, typically totalling more than \u00a3300 a year, that are paid irrespective of how much energy households use.",
      "Under Ofgem's price cap, standing charges have risen by 43% since 2019.",
      "Those with low energy usage, such as people who live alone, argued that even if they further reduced how much gas and electricity they used, they saw little difference in their bills. They wanted more control over their bills.",
      "However, those with high energy needs could see a big rise in bills were these charges to be included in the price of each unit of energy used. It would mean higher bills for people with disabilities who have to charge up specialist equipment.",
      "\"We hear from people who've turned off their heating, ration their hot water, and avoid charging essential mobility devices, yet still feel like they're fighting a losing battle with their energy bills,\" said Alex Belsham-Harris from Citizens Advice.",
      "Ofgem's proposed solution is to tell energy firms to make a dual pricing offer - one with, and one without, a standing charge. The tariff without a standing charge would have a higher price for each unit of energy. Both would fall under the existing price cap system.",
      "Such tariffs already exist, but only from a handful of suppliers and are not available to everyone.",
      "Customers would need to make a choice, but some campaigners want those with low energy use to automatically move on to a deal free of standing charges.",
      "\"The problem with presenting a choice of price caps is many vulnerable people won't make that choice,\" said Martin Lewis, founder of Money Saving Expert.",
      "One of those who could benefit would be Joanne Wilkinson.",
      "\"I try not to look [at the standing charges] because it's depressing,\" she said.",
      "She said she had enough to worry about dealing with baby daughter Adeline, but noticed how quickly the meter goes through the money that was loaded on to it.",
      "Lower wages in the north of England made it even harder for parents like her to afford energy bills, she said, especially as she was still on maternity leave.",
      "But Energy UK, which represents suppliers, said that such a fundamental proposed change needed careful consideration.",
      "\"It would be a major undertaking to make all customers aware of this change and to ensure they then choose the best option for their circumstances,\" said the trade body's chief executive, Dhara Vyas.",
      "She told the BBC the addition of a zero standing charge price cap option would \"quite significantly change the nature of the price cap\".",
      "\"It would go from being one single regulated price that gives customers protection whether or not they switch, to a situation where I think customers might be expected to make an active choice about which cap they are on.\"",
      "Asked whether standing charges should be scrapped altogether, Tim Jarvis, director general of markets at Ofgem, told the BBC the option had been looked at, but added the costs \"need to appear in bills somewhere\".",
      "He said moving costs into unit rates could have \"some quite bad effects on people in some of the most vulnerable situations\".",
      "The regulator's proposals do not deal with the variation of standing charges in different parts of the UK, with billpayers in some areas paying considerably more. Ofgem intends to make that part of a wider, separate inquiry.",
      "Debt repayment plan",
      "The amount of money owed to suppliers by customers has nearly doubled in two years, now totalling about \u00a33.8bn.",
      "The regulator is also setting out a plan for next winter that would deal with some of this debt, built up during a period of high prices, that has little chance of being repaid.",
      "It is planning a \"debt guarantee\" to improve the standard of service offered by suppliers supporting customers in debt, which it said would give households \"consistent, compassionate and tailored support\".",
      "Suppliers could also be required to accept debt repayment offers from reputable third parties such as debt advice agencies or consumer organisations."

    "story": [
      "Electrical goods retailer Currys has said that some price increases will be \"inevitable\" after tax rises announced in the latest Budget.",
      "Currys boss Alex Baldock said the \"unwelcome\" tax changes announced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves will also put a dampener on investment and hiring plans.",
      "A rise in employer National Insurance contributions and the minimum wage going up have led several businesses to warn they will have to pass on costs to consumers.",
      "Currys said recent changes to tax and other government policy would increase its costs by \u00a332m, and it had only planned for about half of that.",
      "Those costs break down as \u00a312m from increased National Insurance contributions, \u00a39m from the rise in the National Living Wage, \u00a32m from business rates due to inflation, and \u00a39m from its supply chain hiking costs due to wages and tax, the firm said in its first-half results.",
      "\"The unwelcome headwinds from UK government policy... [will] add cost quickly and materially, depress investment and hiring, boost automation and offshoring, and make some price rises inevitable,\" said Mr Baldock.",
      "The government has insisted that it has been taking tough choices to lay the groundwork for future economic growth.",
      "Last month Currys was one of the firms behind a letter from major UK retailers to the chancellor saying that High Street job losses were \"inevitable\", prices would rise, and shops would close because of tax increases in the Budget and other rising costs.",
      "Businesses including Sainsbury's, Marks & Spencer and BT have all hinted at price rises due to the changes, while pub chain Wetherspoons has said \"all hospitality business\" will increase prices.",
      "Primark's owner has also said it may invest more overseas due to the \"weight of tax rises\" in the UK.",
      "The comments from Currys came as it reported a loss before tax of \u00a310m in the half year to 26 October, down from a \u00a344m loss a year earlier.",
      "The retailer makes most of its profit in the second half of the year, which includes Black Friday and the key Christmas trading period.",
      "Sales for the half year rose by 1% to \u00a33.92bn across the group, with a \"strong\" performance in the UK helped to offset falling sales in its Nordics business.",
      "Mr Baldock said he was \"very encouraged\" by the company's progress, and profits were expected to grow this year."

      "Born in the Colombian city of Medell\u00edn in 1991 her full name is Carolina Giraldo Navarro. She wanted to be a singer from an early age, and when she was 14 she appeared on the Colombian version of the talent show X Factor in 2005.",
      "Success did not immediately follow, and instead by 2014 she had moved to the US to live with her aunt in New York City to learn English and do menial work. She almost gave up pursuing a career in music at this time, but her father convinced her that she could make it.",
      "While in the US Karol G also attended a music business conference in Boston, which she says was very helpful in helping her understand how the industry worked.",
      "She got her breakthrough hit single in 2017, the song Ahora Me Llama, which was a collaboration with Puerto Rican male artist Bad Bunny. Her first album Unstoppable then followed.",
      "Since then the hits have just kept on coming, and her 2023 album, Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito, was the first entirely Spanish-language release by a female artist to top the US album chart.",
      "Karol G's style of music is more often described as \"reggaeton\". This combines hip-hop with Latin American and Jamaican music, with the singing and rapping usually done in Spanish.",
      "While she is widely reported to be both hardworking and ambitious, Roc\u00edo Guerrero, head of Latin music at Amazon Music, says that the singer \u2013 and Latin music in general - have been greatly helped by the rise of streaming, both the music and the accompanying videos.",

      "\"Radio stations were local, but with streaming we brought together all of those audiences [around the globe]. It has given more opportunity to more Latin songs and artist to be exposed. Karol G is a perfect example of this evolution.\"",

      "And this year, Karol's G's Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito album was the fourth most streamed globally on Spotify.",
      "This helped to boost interest in her 2023-24 sell-out, global Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito Tour. This grossed $307m in ticket sales. And while that figure is dwarfed by the $2bn achieved by Taylor Swift's Eras tour, Karol G's earnings were the highest for a female Latin artist.",
      "Carlos Balado, a professor at OBS Business School in Barcelona, analyses the economic impact of music concerts. He says that both Karol G and Taylor Swift have benefited from the increased popularity of going to such a big live event.",
      "\"There's a growing trend where the public considers that part of their normal spending has to go towards concerts,\" he adds.",
      "Leila Cobo, chief content officer for Latin/Espa\u00f1ol at US music magazine Billboard, which is also known for its music charts, says Karol G has helped to put Colombian music on the map.",
      "\"I think music is the biggest ambassador for Colombia. I really do,\" she says. \"And Karol G has tapped into this female Latin female fanbase who really didn't have someone like her. They wanted someone relatable, fun, sexy, had cool songs, but wasn't completely over the top.",
      "\"And reggaeton is super danceable, it's super consumable, it's super youth oriented,\" adds Ms Cobo, who is the author of a book on Latin music.",
      "Despite winning numerous awards and critical acclaim, Karol G has not been immune to criticism. Her lyrics have been slammed for being too raunchy, and critics have also taken aim at her for calling one of her songs \"Bichota\". This is a slang term meaning big shot or boss, and often associated with drugs and criminality.",
      "She argues that she repurposed the word to signify empowerment. As for her lyrics, her defenders say that rather than singing about and objectifying women, she sings on behalf of them.",
      "Karol G's estimated net worth had skyrocketed to $25m by 2023 according to Celebrity Net Worth - a figure that's likely increased substantially since her recent tour.",
      "Outside of music she earns money by collaborations with shoemaker Crocs, sportswear brand Kappa, Smirnoff vodka, and Spanish fashion label Loewe. Her name has also appeared on the front of FC Barcelona shirts as part of the football club's partnership with music streamer Spotify.",
      "Ms Cobo says: \"She's branching out. She's a very bright, inquisitive person and always looking to grow. And she's very aware that it's not just about music.\"",

      "Three suspects have already been interviewed under caution and there are plans to interview others next year, according to police.",
      "But no one will be charged until officers have read the final report from the separate public inquiry, almost 30 years after concerns were first raised.",
      "'Taken its toll'",
      "Lee Castleton, a sub-postmaster from Bridlington, near Hull, who was bankrupted in 2004 after losing a two-year battle with the Post Office over Horizon, said: \"I can't understand why it's taken so long, I can't understand why things are having to be gone over and over and over... But you know, never give in, we'll get there.\"",
      "Former sub-postmistress Seema Misra was wrongly found guilty of theft and false accounting in 2010, and sent to prison while eight-weeks pregnant.",

The investigation will be led by the Metropolitan Police in London, while Police Scotland, the Police Service of Northern Ireland and National Crime Agency are also involved.",
      "Commander Stephen Clayman said the scale of the investigation was \"unprecedented\".",
      "\"We have got, we think, over 3,000 people affected in some way, by Horizon. So it's huge and we have got to put in a commensurate number of officers, to start moving it at pace,\" he said.",
      "The first phase of the investigation will focus on those making \"key decisions\" on investigations and prosecutions, looking at possible offences of perjury and the serious offence of perverting the course of justice.",
      "A second phase will cast the net wider, potentially taking in senior post office executives.",
      "Work is already underway on building some of the cases, and police are in regular dialogue with the Crown Prosecution Service.",
      "The first trials may involve cases from either phase, police said, but timescales and the numbers of potential suspects could change as more evidence is gathered.",
      "Officers are already working with 1.5 million documents in the case and expect this number to grow.",
      "The investigation has also launched an online portal to allow sub-postmasters and others to submit evidence to the investigation."

      "US inflation - the rate at which prices increase - rose slightly to 2.7% last month, official figures showed. Despite the increase, prices are rising far more slowly than in June 2022, when Russia's invasion of Ukraine sparked turmoil in global oil markets and sent fuel prices soaring.",
      "Though the progress has appeared in economic data for months, economic dissatisfaction has remained high, as price increases in other areas, such as housing, overshadowed the wider improvement.",
      "The issue played a key role in the US election, helping Donald Trump win re-election to the White House last month.",

      "\"Inflation has been coming steadily back into focus in the US,\" said Lindsay James, investment strategist at Quilter Investors.",
      "\"This is due in part to the lack of progress that has been made over the last three months, but also because of concerns that higher US government spending plus the introduction of Trump's tariffs could create a more inflationary backdrop.\"",
      "The US central bank lowered interest rates for the first time in more than four years in September, citing the progress stabilising prices.",
      "Many analysts still expect officials to announce another cut to interest rates at their meeting this month, but they have warned that rates are likely to stay higher than previously expected next year unless price increases in areas outside of petrol start to ease more significantly.",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 01:42:14 GMT",
    "summary": "The charity is one of a number of care organisations warning they will have to axe vital services.",
    "story": [
      "A leading charity that supports people with learning disabilities says it may be forced to stop running at least 60 of its services as a result of increasing National Insurance costs.",
      "Mencap is one of a growing number of care organisations warning they will have to axe vital services because of the impact of the Budget.",
      "Businesses - including charities - currently pay a rate of 13.8% National Insurance on employees' earnings above \u00a39,100 a year. But that will increase to 15% in April 2025, instead starting when wages reach \u00a35,000.",
      "Mencap says the rise will cost it \u00a35.3m every year.",
      "The government also announced an increase to the national minimum wage during the Budget - with hourly rates for over-21s set to go up to \u00a312.21 an hour. That will cost the charity a further \u00a36.7m, it says.",
      "Combined with having to increase wages for other workers as a result of the minimum wage rise, the charity estimates the changes will cost up to \u00a318m a year.",
      "Local authorities, who pay for most social care for older and disabled people, say the rising costs for the sector are \"insurmountable\".",
      "The government says it is tackling the challenges facing adult social care, as well as providing it with extra money as part of \u00a33.5bn in additional funding for councils in England next year.",
      "Round-the-clock support",
      "Twenty-six people with a range of learning disabilities live at Churchfields, in Essex. It is one of 600 services run by Mencap across England, Wales and Northern Ireland.",
      "While Churchfields is not under threat, contracts to provide other similar services could be ended, Mencap says.",
      "Among the residents at Churchfields are Barry and Betty. Both use wheelchairs and need round-the-clock support. Betty can speak a few words, but Barry is non-verbal. He often relies on sign language and answering yes/no questions written for him on a white board to communicate.",
      "But with both, their faces and reactions can tell their story more eloquently than words.",
      "Their faces light up when they see each other. Betty lifts Barry's hand to kiss it and they both smile and laugh. An engagement ring glimmers on Betty's left hand \u2013 staff helped Barry propose to her.",
      "Teeto Adegbenro, who is one of Barry's care workers, is passionate about his work.",
      "\"The quality of life you give to these people is the experience they have in their life,\" he says.",
      "It takes 50 staff to support the people at Churchfields to live full lives. Mencap employs about 7,500 staff across all its services. Many care workers are on low pay.",
      "October's Budget increased the national minimum wage (NMW) - a move that was expected and welcomed by those running care services in a sector where it is hard to recruit.",
      "However, care organisations say the changes to National Insurance contributions (NICs) will have a big impact - particularly on social care, where many people work part-time and were previously below the threshold to pay the tax.",
      "Mencap says the NICs increase will add at least \u00a3615 to the annual costs of employing each of its staff members.",
      "When that is combined with the rise in the minimum wage, the charity will have to find an extra \u00a312m each year.",
      "But if the charity increases everyone's salary to maintain pay differences that reflect levels of experience and responsibility, then it says the annual additional costs could rise to \u00a318m.",
      "Mencap's chief executive, Jon Sparkes, told the BBC it may have to stop running at least 60 services.",
      "\"They are services that provide basic daily social care, support for 200 people with a learning disability, and services that employ about 400 people,\" he says. \"Those are the services I'm worried about immediately.\"",
      "He warned: \"It could be more.\"",
      "Local authorities pay the charity to support people with learning disabilities, so in practice it would be handing contracts back to councils.",
      "Mr Sparkes says unless there is a substantial increase in fees they will have to tell councils \"we can't afford to run this service safely on the funding that we're getting\".",
      "Similar worries are widespread across adult social care services. A new report, commissioned by care associations and written by health and care analysts LaingBuisson, says 80-85% of social care in England is provided by small, local organisations, which have little financial resilience.",
      "Dr Jane Townson, of the Homecare Association, representing providers who support people in their own homes, is worried there is a real risk of a \"significant reduction in care and support services\".",
      "She fears that will leave some people without essential services, and increase the pressure on families and the NHS.",
      "\"We are at a tipping point and need immediate government intervention,\" she says.",
      "Most social care in England is funded by councils. Care providers estimate that just to cover the increased costs of the national minimum wage and NICs fees for their services would need to increase by 9-10% next year.",
      "But local authorities are also under huge financial pressure. Melanie Williams, president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS), represents the people who run council social care.",
      "She says local authorities are already struggling financially, facing inflationary costs and increasing demand from people who need more complex care.",
      "\"The costs are insurmountable,\" she says. \"Many of us have overspends in adult social services. It just feels that we're in an impossible situation.\"",
      "ADASS calculates that an additional \u00a31.8bn is needed for care services in England \"just to stand still\".",
      "The government says ensuring there is a stable economy is one of the foundations for it's plan to  \"deliver stability, growth and investment for communities across the UK\".",
      "It says it is tackling the challenges facing social care with a range of measures, including improving staff pay and increasing financial support for families with caring responsibilities, adding: \"We are tackling the challenges facing adult social care and taking the first steps towards building a National Care Service.\"",
      "The spokesperson added: \"We are giving local authorities an additional \u00a33.5bn in 2025-26, including a \u00a3680m increase in the social care grant to support the sector.\"",

    "summary": "The company saw a 40% increase in pollution incidents in the first half of the year as its debts continued to swell.",
    "story": [
      "The boss of Thames Water has defended executive bonuses as the firm calls for a hike in customer bills to ensure its survival.",
      "Chris Weston said the supplier needed to offer \"competitive packages\" to attract talent, but the water regulator has previously said that customers must not foot the bill for \"undeserved bonuses\".",
      "It comes as the embattled company saw a 40% increase in pollution incidents in the six months to 30 September, as its debts continued to swell, according to its latest set of results.",
      "Thames approaches a critical moment next week, with Ofwat set to decide whether to allow a proposed 59% increase in consumer bills over the next five years.",
      "The ailing business is saddled with debts which stood at just under \u00a316bn at the end of September.",
      "The firm has said customer bills need to rise or else it will not be able to recover from its financial crisis. However, if the company does collapse, water supplies will not be affected.",
      "Water firms across the UK have faced a fierce backlash over sewage discharges and pipe leaks in recent years, but Thames has been in the spotlight given its debt pile, and the fact one in four people in the UK rely on it.",
      "Critics have argued the water industry has historically neglected investment in favour of paying executive bonuses and shareholder dividends.",
      "But on Tuesday, Mr Weston defended bosses getting \u00a3770,000 in bonuses.",
      "\"I completely understand that there are customers out there who struggle with their bills,\" he added, pointing to bill support offered to about 377,000 customers in the last year.",
      "Mr Weston, who was hired in January, was also awarded a bonus of \u00a3195,000 for his first three months at the company.",
      "The regulator Ofwat recently blocked three companies, including Thames, from using customer money to pay executive bonuses as bills have steadily increased.",
      "Why is Thames Water in so much trouble?",
      "How much sewage is released into lakes, rivers and the sea?",
      "A final decision on whether Thames can increase its bills by 59% is due on 19 December.",
      "Mr Weston described the upcoming decision as a \"critical\" step which would be \"fundamental\" to the company's future.",
      "Bosses have argued they need extra cash to make Thames \"investible\" enough to attract fresh funding, and to pay for improvements to its network of pipes and sewers.",
      "Thames reported a 40% rise in sewage pollution with 359 incidents in the six months to September.",
      "Mr Weston blamed a particularly wet spring and summer period, and said that problems with its infrastructure were \"decades in the making\".",
      "Ofwat has also appointed an independent monitor to supervise Thames as it attempts its turnaround.",
      "Pivotal moment",
      "The company could run out of money within the first three months of 2025, which is why its creditors have offered it a further \u00a33bn cash loan to be released in two tranches, the first \u00a31.5bn of which could be released in February.",
      "It is waiting for a court date next week to approve the cash injection which could prove pivotal as it would mean it had enough money to last until October next year.",
      "An insider told the BBC that if it was not for the firm's huge debt pile, Thames would be in reasonable shape financially.",
      "In its latest results, it reported a profit before tax of \u00a3249.6m for the six months to September, up 20% on the year before.",
      "When Thames Water was privatised in 1989 it had no debt. However, over the years it borrowed heavily.",
      "Thames needs to raise about \u00a34bn in new equity too, which would not need to be paid back.",
      "While there are several interested parties that could put that money in, the investment would depend on how much pain lenders are willing to take and whether or not Ofwat will allow the company to push through steep bill increases.",
      "Mr Weston said on Tuesday there was \"considerable interest\" from potential equity investors in the company.",
      "But the process for an equity injection cannot be finalised until Ofwat makes a decision on bill increases.",
      "Unions argued on Tuesday that a recovery for the company was now \"virtually impossible\".",
      "Gary Carter, the national officer of the GMB union, called for government to step in.",
      "\"Right now the company is being squashed by an ever-increasing debt mountain, on increasingly arduous terms,\" he added.",
      "Unite general secretary Sharon Graham also called for officials to stand up for the \"public interest\" and consider bringing Thames back into public ownership.",
      "Speaking on Tuesday, Mr Weston said that the firm had not asked the government or regulators to step in and implement a form of publicly funded administration, called a special administration regime."

    "title": "Water giant uses accounting trick to inflate balance sheet by \u00a31.68bn",
    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 17:00:17 GMT",
    "summary": "A substantial Severn Trent Water investment is based on IOU notes - BBC Panorama finds.",
    "story": [
      "One of England's top-rated water companies is using an accounting trick to artificially inflate its balance sheet by more than a billion pounds, BBC Panorama has discovered.",
      "Severn Trent Water claims that an investment is worth \u00a31.68bn in its accounts, when in reality it has no value to the overall business.",
      "The made-up money makes the company appear more financially robust and helps to support its bumper payouts to shareholders.",
      "Severn Trent denies the accounts are misleading and says Panorama's allegations are \"completely inaccurate\".",
      "The water company - which is regulated by Ofwat - is part of a complex web of companies in the wider Severn Trent plc group.",
      "It serves more than eight million people across central England and mid-Wales and has been awarded the Environment Agency's top four-star rating for environmental performance for a record five consecutive years. Its ultimate parent company, Severn Trent plc, is popular with investors, as it has consistently paid large dividends to shareholders.",
      "But some of Severn Trent's customers are unhappy. The Shrewsbury-based campaign group Up Sewage Creek wants more of the company's earnings to be used to combat pollution in local rivers. \"They've not updated the infrastructure, they've used our money to enrich themselves and enrich their shareholders,\" one of the campaigners told us.",
      "The complex accounting trick started in March 2017 when a shell company, with no money or assets, called Severn Trent Trimpley was set up as part of the group. Another Severn Trent company called Severn Trent Draycote - which owns the water company - agreed to buy Trimpley for \u00a32.",
      "Trimpley then issued additional shares and Draycote bought them for a staggering \u00a33bn.",
      "No money actually changed hands, however, as Draycote paid Trimpley with a \u00a33bn loan note - effectively an IOU. But, on paper, Trimpley immediately appeared to be worth \u00a33bn because it had the IOU.",
      "Severn Trent Water then acquired 49% of Trimpley - and that investment was valued in the water company's accounts at \u00a31.47bn. A hugely valuable asset appears to have been created for Severn Trent Water out of thin air.",
      "Panorama discovered the Trimpley investment through the work of retired auditor Stanley Root.",
      "He told the programme: \"This is as near to an unreal transaction as you can get - that has just been made up and put into the accounts to make the accounts look better.",
      "\"I think it misleads the reader to think that the net assets of Severn Trent Water Limited are higher than they are and that the company is in a much healthier position than it really is. So I think the balance sheet, the financial statements, are misleading.\"",
      "Since 2017, the made-up money on Severn Trent Water's books has grown in value because of interest payments.",
      "Draycote has agreed to pay Trimpley interest on the \u00a33bn IOU, which means the IOU gets bigger each year.",
      "As the value of the IOU goes up, so does the paper value of Trimpley. And that means Severn Trent Water's investment in Trimpley rises every year too.",
      "The Trimpley investment is now valued at \u00a31.68bn in the regulated water company's 2023/24 accounts.",
      "Those accounts were audited and signed off by Severn Trent Water's directors. When referring to the Trimpley investment, the accounts say: \"In the opinion of the directors the fair value of the company's investments are not less than the amount at which they are stated in the balance sheet.\"",
      "While that may be technically correct, the \u00a31.68bn value is based on an IOU that is ultimately backed up by Severn Trent Water itself.",
      "In the wider group accounts the made-up money is cancelled out by the IOU that Draycote issued, so it is only the balance sheet of the regulated water company, Severn Trent Water, that is inflated.",
      "So why do it? Severn Trent told the BBC that Trimpley was set up to allow the water company to legitimately account for future earnings, but that it has never been used for that purpose.",
      "Another possible explanation is that Trimpley helps support increased dividends.",
      "As well as bolstering the balance sheet, the made-up \u00a31.68bn has also been added to Severn Trent Water's retained earnings - that is the pot of money from which cash can be paid out to shareholders. The more money there is in that pot, the easier it is to justify large dividends.",
      "Since Trimpley was added to the accounts in 2017, Severn Trent Water Ltd has paid out \u00a31.615bn in dividends.",
      "Profits over the same period were \u00a31.246bn, so Severn Trent Water has paid out \u00a3369m more than it made in profit during that period. It looks like cash is being drained from the regulated water company.",
      "Auditor Stanley Root says water companies are under great pressure to pay substantial dividends and the Trimpley scheme helps Severn Trent Water deliver.",
      "\"It makes the company's balance sheet look more stable than it really is. It gives them the appearance of financial resilience. It helps to support the dividend payments they're making.\"",
      "Severn Trent denies that Trimpley has supported shareholder payouts: \"All dividends paid by Severn Trent are justified by earnings and any assertion otherwise is unjustified and wrong.\"",
      "However, it is clear that Trimpley is having a dramatic effect on the pot of money from which shareholders can be paid.",
      "Severn Trent Water's 2023/24 accounts - which include the \u00a31.68bn investment - report the company has very healthy retained earnings of \u00a31.84bn.",
      "But the accounts for the wider Severn Trent Group, where all the creative accounting is cancelled out, show retained earnings of just \u00a37.9m.",
      "Severn Trent says: \"Trimpley is an entirely legitimate, legal and transparent structure.\"",
      "Its accounts are independently audited and \"any suggestion that we have misled our investors, regulators and customers on the company's finances is false\".",
      "It says the IOU is \"very much a real asset\" as it is backed up by other group companies.",
      "Severn Trent also says it is in good financial health, it raised an additional billion pounds from shareholders last year and will continue to invest record amounts into infrastructure.",

    "story": [
      "A real-life \"Succession\" battle for Rupert Murdoch's media empire has ended with a Nevada court commissioner denying the billionaire's bid to change a family trust and give control to his eldest son.",
      "The case pitted the 93-year-old against three of his children over who would gain the power to control News Corp and Fox News when he dies.",
      "It has been reported that Mr Murdoch wanted to amend a family trust created in 1999 to allow his son Lachlan to take control without \"interference\" from his siblings Prudence, Elisabeth and James.",
      "A Nevada commissioner ruled Mr Murdoch and Lachlan had acted in \"bad faith\" and called the efforts a \"carefully crafted charade\", according to the New York Times.",
      "In a statement, a spokesperson for Prudence, Elisabeth and James said: \"We welcome Commissioner Gorman's decision and hope that we can move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members.\"",
      "Adam Streisand, a lawyer for Mr Murdoch, told the New York Times they were disappointed and planned to appeal.",
      "A spokesperson for Mr Murdoch declined to comment to the BBC. Mr Streisand did not immediately respond to inquiries.",
      "The famous family was one of the inspirations behind the hugely popular TV series Succession - something the Murdochs have always refused to comment on.",
      "But according to the New York Times report, which is based on a copy of the sealed court ruling, the billionaire's children had started discussing their father's death and how they would handle it after an episode of the HBO series where \"the patriarch of the family dies, leaving his family and business in chaos\".",
      "The episode led to Elisabeth's representative to the trust writing a \"'Succession' memo\" that sought to prevent this from happening in real life, said reports.",
      "The case has played out behind closed doors in Nevada, a state that offers one of the most confidential legal settings for matters including family trust disputes.",
      "It has a \"close on demand\" statute that allows parties involved in certain sensitive cases to request that court proceedings be sealed from public access, ensuring complete privacy.",
      "Mr Murdoch, who has been married five times, also has two younger children, Grace and Chloe, who do not have any voting rights under the trust agreement.",
      "The case was launched after Mr Murdoch decided to change the trust over worries about a \"lack of consensus\" among the children, the Times reported.",
      "Lachlan is thought to be more conservative than his siblings and would preserve the legacy of his media brands.",
      "From the 1960s, Mr Murdoch built a global media giant with major political and public influence.",
      "His two companies are News Corporation, which owns newspapers including the Times and the Sun in the UK and the Wall Street Journal in the US, and Fox, which broadcasts Fox News.",
      "Mr Murdoch had been preparing his two sons to follow in his footsteps, beginning when they were teenagers, journalist Andrew Neil told the 2020 BBC documentary The Rise of the Murdoch Dynasty.",
      "\"Family has always been very important to Rupert Murdoch, particularly from the point of view of forming a dynasty,\" the former Sunday Times editor said.",
      "In 1999, the Murdoch Family Trust, which owns the media companies, was supposed to largely settle the succession plans.",
      "It led to Mr Murdoch giving his eldest children various jobs within his companies.",
      "The trust gives the family eight votes, which it can use to have a say on the board of News Corp and Fox News. Mr Murdoch currently controls four of those votes, with his eldest children being in charge of one each.",
      "The trust agreement said that once Mr Murdoch died, his votes would be passed on to his four eldest children equally.",
      "However, differences in opinions and political views were said to lead to a family rift.",
      "The battle over changes to the trust was not about money, but rather power and control over the future of the Murdoch empire.",
      "The commissioner's ruling is not final. The court filing acts as a recommended resolution but a district judge will still weigh in and could choose to rule differently.",
      "The judge could take weeks or months to make a decision, which will not be available to the public.",

    "story": [
      "With winter nights drawing in across North America, Canadian \u201csnowbirds\u201d \u2013 citizens who flee their freezing temperatures for sunnier climes every year \u2013 are planning their annual trips to Florida or the Caribbean.",
      "Traditionally, Cuba has been hugely popular among Canadians, drawn to the pristine white sands of beach resorts like Varadero.",
      "They fill the void left by Americans wary of the travel restrictions imposed on them under the continuing US economic embargo of the largest island in the Caribbean.",
      "Figures show that almost one million Canadian tourists visited Cuba last year, the top country of origin for visitors by some margin.",
      "As such, a recent decision by the Canadian tour operator, Sunwing Vacations Group \u2013 one of Cuba\u2019s leading travel partners \u2013 to remove 26 hotels from its Cuba portfolio is a blow to the island\u2019s struggling tourism industry.",
      "Sunwing took the decision after Cuba endured a four-day nationwide blackout at the end of October, caused by failures with the country's aging energy infrastructure.",
      "This was followed by another national power cut last month, when Hurricane Rafael barrelled its way across the island, worsening an already-acute electricity crisis.",
      "A third countrywide blackout then happened on Wednesday, 4 Dec, after Cuba's largest power plant broke down.",
      "\u201cCuba has had some volatility in the last few weeks and that may shake consumer confidence,\u201d Sunwing\u2019s chief marketing officer, Samantha Taylor told the Pax News travel website last month.",
      "\u201cThere are incredible places to go in Cuba,\u201d she stressed, keen to emphasise that the company isn\u2019t pulling out of Cuba altogether. \u201cBut we also recognise that if clients are a little uncomfortable, we need to give them options.\u201d",
      "Specifically, that involved drawing up a list of what they called \u201chidden gems\u201d \u2013 alternative holiday destinations in the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas and Colombia.",
      "The implications for Cuba are clear.",
      "With tourism now the island\u2019s principal economic motor, and the main source of foreign currency earnings after remittances, that an important tour operator is pointing its customers towards other countries\u2019 beaches over crumbling energy infrastructure is a real concern.",
      "\u201cOur message to Canadians is that tourism is one of the economy\u2019s priorities,\u201d said Lessner G\u00f3mez, director of the Cuban Tourism Board in Toronto in a statement. \u201cThe Ministry of Tourism has been preparing for the winter season to deliver better services, uninterrupted supplies, a better airport experience, and more and new car rentals.\u201d",
      "While Cuba\u2019s tourism agency tries to ease fears about the extent of the electricity blackouts, few can deny that these have been extremely difficult months on the island. Hurricane Rafael was only the latest storm to hit Cuba in a frenetic Atlantic hurricane season in which more powerful and more frequent storms are the new normal.",
      "Of course, severe weather is a problem across the Caribbean. But for Cuba, there are other complications in play.",
      "Donald Trump\u2019s re-election to the White House and his choice for Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, stand to make life even more complicated for Cubans than it already is.",
      "\u201cThis is probably the Cuban Revolution\u2019s hardest moment,\u201d says former Cuban diplomat, Jes\u00fas Arboleya. \u201cAnd unfortunately, I see nothing on the horizon whatsoever which allows for an optimistic view of the future of US-Cuba relations.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump has handed US policy towards Cuba to those sectors of the Cuban American right who have essentially lived off anti-Castro policies since their origins.\u201d",
      "Mr Arboleya adds that Marco Rubio, currently a US Senator for Florida, is the leading voice among them. He is a Cuban American long opposed to the communist government in Havana.",
      "His parents were Cubans who moved to the US in 1956, three years before Fidel Castro seized power, but his grandfather fled the Castro-led turn to communism on the island.",
      "\u201cPeople are horrified by the idea of another Donald Trump presidency. It spells real trouble,\u201d echoes Cuban political commentator and editor of Temas magazine, Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez.",
      "Current US policy towards Cuba is \u201csomewhat schizophrenic\u201d, he argues.",
      "\u201cOn the one hand, the State Department facilitates support to the private sector, and [pushes for] economic changes in Cuba. But on the other hand, Congress and Senate seem to freeze any advances on those reforms.\u201d",
      "The expectation is, however, that a future Secretary of State Rubio will coalesce the US\u2019s Cuba policy around a single idea - maximum pressure on the island by tightening the already-harsh sanctions.",
      "Cubans fear that could mean the suspension of commercial flights to Cuba, or even the closure of the US Embassy in Havana, which was officially reopened in 2015 after decades of frosty relations.",
      "If implemented, such steps would be deliberately designed to further harm Cuba\u2019s floundering tourism trade, the aim to hit the communist-run nation when it\u2019s down. Tourist numbers to Cuba have almost halved since the high point of nearly five million visitors during the Obama-era d\u00e9tente with Cuba.",
      "Between 2015-2017 US visitors flocked to the island under more relaxed travel restrictions, keen to experience a country that had long been denied them. Around the same time, the Cuban government embarked on a major hotel-building spree, confident that demand would remain strong over the next decade.",
      "However, there followed a double blow to Cuban tourism from which it hasn\u2019t fully recovered. First, the Trump Administration rolled back President Obama\u2019s engagement policies, and then the Covid-19 pandemic sent the industry into freefall.",
      "With many of those hotels now registering much lower occupancy rates than originally predicted, and real difficulties in providing the five-star customer experience as advertised amid the blackouts and shortages, some question the strategy of putting so many eggs in the tourism basket in the first place.",
      "\u201cWhy has Cuba invested 38% [of government funds] on average over the past decade in hotels and infrastructure connected to international tourism, but only 8 to 9% on energy infrastructure?\u201d asks economist Ricardo Torres at the American University in Washington DC. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense. The hotels run on electricity.\u201d",
      "Even with all the current challenges, most visitors agree that Cuba remains a unique travel experience. The cliches \u2013 classic cars, cigars and mojitos \u2013 still appeal to many, while others prefer to travel the island absorbing its history, culture and music.",
      "Yet as tour operator Sunwings\u2019 decision to step back shows, some tourists are finding it hard to appreciate Cuba during its energy crisis, especially if it\u2019s about to be exacerbated by a hostile administration \u2013 and Secretary of State \u2013 in Washington."

    "title": "Puberty blockers: Can a drug trial solve one of medicine's most controversial debates?",
    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 00:43:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The government has pledged to determine the evidence - and establish whether the benefits outweigh any potential harms of prescribing puberty blockers to children questioning their gender",
    "story": [
      "It is among the most delicate and controversial challenges in modern medicine - how to determine whether the benefits of puberty blockers (or drugs that delay puberty) outweigh the potential harms.",
      "This question came to the fore in June 2023 when NHS England proposed that in the future, these drugs would only be prescribed to children questioning their gender as part of clinical research.",
      "Since then, a new government has arrived in Westminster and Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said he is committed to \"setting up a clinical trial\" to establish the evidence on puberty blockers. The National Institute for Health and Care Research is expected to confirm soon that funding is in place for a trial.",
      "The dilemma that remains is, how will such a trial work?",
      "Eighteen months since the announcement there is still a lack of consensus around how the trial should be conducted. It will also need to be approved by a committee of experts who have to decide, among other things, whether what's being tested might cause undue physical or psychological harm.",
      "But there is a second unanswered question that some, but by no means all, scientists have that is more pressing than the first: is it right to perform this particular trial on children and young people at all?",
      "A rapid rise in referrals",
      "When the Gender and Identity Development Service (GIDS) was established at London's Tavistock Clinic in 1989, it was the only NHS specialist gender clinic for children in England, and those referred there were typically offered psychological and social support.",
      "Over the last 10 years, however, there has been a rapid increase in referrals - with the greatest increase being people registered female at birth. In a separate development, around the same time the approach of typically offering psychological and social support moved to one of onward referrals to services that prescribed hormone drugs, such as puberty blockers.",
      "Known scientifically as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, puberty blockers work on the brain to stop the rise in sex hormones - oestrogen and testosterone - that accompany puberty. For years, they were prescribed to young patients with gender dysphoria (those who feel their gender identity is different from their biological sex). But in March 2024, NHS England stopped the routine prescribing of puberty blockers to under 18s, as part of an overhaul of children's gender identity services.",
      "NHS England said in a policy statement: \"There is not enough evidence to support the safety or clinical effectiveness of PSH [puberty suppressing hormones] to make the treatment routinely available at this time.\"",
      "The ban was later tightened to apply to private clinics as well.",
      "In April 2024, a review of gender identity services for children and young people, led by Dr Hilary Cass, a past president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, published its final report, which called out the \"field of gender care\" for not taking a cautious and careful approach.",
      "She also reported that the change in practice at GIDS away from one primarily relying on psychological and social support was largely based on a single study that looked at the effect of medical interventions such as puberty blockers on a very narrowly defined group of children and there was a lack of follow up in the longer term.",
      "Elsewhere, some other countries were re-examining puberty blockers too. Scotland paused the use of them while Finland, Sweden, France, Norway, and Denmark have all re-evaluated their positions on medical intervention for under 18s - including puberty blockers - to differing degrees. In other places there is still support for the use of puberty blockers.",
      "In medicine, when there is genuine uncertainty as to whether the benefits of a treatment outweigh the harms - called equipoise - some ethicists argue there's a moral obligation to scientifically study such treatments. But there are some from across the debate who don't think there is equipoise in this case.",
      "The ethical dilemma at the heart of the trial",
      "The BBC has learned details about the arguments going on around the concept of a trial and how it could look. Some argue that there is already evidence that puberty blockers can help with mental health, and that in light of this it would be unethical to perform a trial at all because this would mean some young people experiencing gender distress would not be given them.",
      "The World Professional Association of Transgender Health (WPATH) has expressed their concern about the trial for this reason. They support the use of puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and surgery. WPATH, who have faced increasing criticism of their guidelines from some clinicians, say that it is ethically problematic to make participation in a trial the only way to access a type of care that is \"evidence based, widely recognised as medically necessary, and often reported as lifesaving.\"",
      "Meanwhile other clinicians believe there is no good evidence that puberty blockers can help with mental health at all. They also point to research that questions the negative impact that the drugs might have on brain development among teenagers, as well as evidence around the negative impact on bone density.",
      "Dr Louise Irvine is a GP and co-chair of the Clinical Advisory Network on Sex and Gender which says it is cautious about using medical pathways in gender dysphoric children. She says: \"Given that puberty blockers by definition disrupt a crucial natural phase of human development, the anticipated benefits must be tangible and significant to justify the risk to children.",
      "\"In pushing ahead with a puberty blockers trial, we are concerned that political interests are being prioritised over clinical, ethical and scientific concerns, and over the health and wellbeing of children.\"",
      "The NHS adult gender services holds data that tracks 9,000 young people from the youth service. Some argue that this should be scrutinised before any trial goes ahead as it could provide evidence on, among other things, the potential risks of taking puberty blockers.",
      "But there is a third view held by some others, including Gordon Guyatt, a professor at McMaster University in Canada, who points out that randomised trials are done in \"life-threatening stuff all the time\" where no-one can be sure of the long-term effects of a treatment. In his view it would be \"unethical not to do it\".",
      "\"With only low quality evidence, people's philosophies, their attitudes or their politics, will continue to dominate the discussion,\" he argues. \"If we do not generate better evidence, the destructive, polarised debate will continue.\"",
      "- Dr Cass found the existing research in the field was poor quality and that there was not a reliable enough evidence base to base clinical decisions on. Young people involved in many of the existing studies may have also had interventions including psychological support and other medical treatments and so it was not always possible to disentangle the effect of each different treatment.",
      "- When it comes to suppressing puberty by using drugs, the rationale for doing so \"remains unclear\", Dr Cass said.  One of the original reasons given was to allow time to think by delaying the onset of puberty. But the evidence suggests the vast majority who start on puberty blockers go on to take cross-sex hormones - oestrogen or testosterone. It is not clear why but one theory, the Cass report suggests, is that puberty blockers may, in their own right, change the \"trajectory\" of gender identity development.",
      "- Clinicians \"are unable to determine with any certainty\" which young people \"will go on to have an enduring trans identity\", Dr Cass wrote. In other words, there's a lack of clarity about which young people might benefit in the long term and which may be harmed overall by the process.",
      "How the trial could look",
      "Recruitment for the trial is due to start in 2025, months later than originally anticipated. Young people will likely be referred after a full assessment by specialist clinicians. A lot is still to be determined, including how many participants there will be.",
      "Ultimately the scientists running the trials will need to establish whether people who get an intervention are better off than those who do not. In this case, do the puberty blocking drugs and their effect make the young people better off?",
      "\"Better off\" in this instance includes the extent to which a young person's mental health may be improved if they are happy with their body. Quality of life is determined by various factors including self-confidence and self-esteem. As well as getting the personal views from the young people and parents, the trial could measure actual real life changes, such as time spent in education and time spent with family and friends.",
      "But there are potential harms to study too, such as the possibility of reduced bone density. Some scientists suggest examining the impact on learning using a form of IQ test.",
      "Normal brain development is influenced by both puberty and chronological age, which usually act in tandem during adolescence. It's not clear how this is affected when puberty is suppressed. Brain scans are one way of understanding any effect.",
      "Some scientists believe it may be possible to simply randomly assign trial participants into two groups where one gets puberty blockers, the other gets a placebo and nobody is aware which group they're in.",
      "But others believe a placebo group is impossible. They say the placebo group would go through puberty, realise they weren't on puberty blockers and potentially drop out of the trial or even find other ways to obtain puberty blockers. Either scenario would reduce the validity of the results.",
      "Professor Gordon Guyatt and others have outlined a potential trial where the group of patients not receiving drugs would be made up entirely of children who are keen to socially transition, such as by changing how they dress and altering their name and pronouns. Researchers could then monitor the difference between the groups.",
      "A second possibility is that both trial groups are given puberty blockers but one group gets them after a delay, during which time they receive psychological and emotional support. This would help researchers determine, among other things, whether their gender-related distress subsides during that delay while receiving the support.",
      "Alongside this there would be a \"matched\" control group that doesn't take a placebo or puberty blockers, whether for health reasons or because they don't want to, that get similar tests and scans.",
      "Puberty occurs in stages when different bodily changes occur. A third proposal could involve a second group being given drugs at a later stage in puberty than the first.",
      "This would allow researchers to explore when the right time to give puberty blockers might be. For example, it would enable the researchers to see if starting the drugs early improves wellbeing by reducing gender-specific body changes. They would also be able to see whether starting the drugs earlier has a greater negative impact on bone density and brain development.",
      "Children referred to GIDS also experienced higher rates of anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and autism compared to the general child population. Trial participants would continue to receive treatment related to these conditions but - so we know any differences in the results from the groups are down to the drug - they will need to be balanced for the above conditions.",
      "All these considerations demonstrate the complexity of trying to obtain evidence in this area that is reliable and definitive.",
      "What parents say",
      "Many parents are watching closely to see how it will play out. Annabel (not her real name) is one of them. She is part of the Bayswater Group, a collection of parents with children who are questioning their gender who say they are \"wary of medical solutions to gender dysphoria\". She began looking into puberty blockers when her own daughter began questioning her gender in her early teens, an option put on the table by GIDS.",
      "Ultimately her daughter decided not to take them. Annabel was not convinced there was enough evidence to show they were beneficial and she was unsure what it would mean for her daughter's long-term physical and psychological health.",
      "Today, she still has unanswered questions - including some further ones around the trial. \"A big concern for me is will this new trial, if it gets approval, give us the evidence that we want? Or will we end up with more weak data that Dr Cass said undermined decision making in this area?\"",
      "Natacha Kennedy, a lecturer at Goldsmiths, University of London who researches transgender issues, has examined the results of a survey of 97 parents of young people with gender-related distress that took place following the puberty blockers ban. She believes that puberty blockers should be an option available for young people questioning their gender and that many will not accept being part of a placebo group in a trial.",
      "\"These parents are desperate and if [they] get to a trial and it turns out their child is not being given the actual puberty blockers, then there is no point in them being there,\" she says.",
      "\"There may be some parents who would\u2026 find another way [to obtain the drugs].\"",
      "Why these Israeli men volunteered to fight - but now refuse to return to Gaza",
      "'I spent 30 years as a therapist to killers - and no-one is born evil'",
      "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",
      "Whatever trial format is settled on, more scrutiny will follow. And there will no doubt be fierce debate about the merits of the trial and what it can tell us, as many scientists around the world are watching to see what happens in the UK.",
      "But inevitably, there will be a long wait to fully understand the longer term effects on physical and mental health of those who take puberty blockers - and the long-term effects on those with gender-related distress who don't. Nor do we know how many people detransition, though the Cass report says, \"there is suggestion that numbers are increasing\".",
      "\"We really need to have long-term follow up,\" argues Annabel. \"Can a child possibly understand what that means to their fertility and a loss of sexual function and what that will mean for their future life?\"",
      "For now, she and the scores of parents, carers and young people, can only watch and wait for the trial to begin and for its verdict - and what that means for whether puberty blockers will be prescribed to children once again in the future.",

      "That's according to Vevo, which is the main provider of official music videos to YouTube. Karol G's were the most streamed around the world for each of the past four years, 2021 to 2024.",
      "This year, Karol G's Vevo videos were watched 3.5 billion times, with fellow Colombian Shakira in second place on 1.96 billion, and Swift on 1.95 billion.",
      "So who is Karol G, and what has fuelled the success that also saw her sell out Madrid's Bernab\u00e9u Stadium over four nights back in July, plus stadiums across the US last year?",
      "Born in the Colombian city of Medell\u00edn in 1991 her full name is Carolina Giraldo Navarro. She wanted to be a singer from an early age, and when she was 14 she appeared on the Colombian version of the talent show X Factor in 2005.",
      "Success did not immediately follow, and instead by 2014 she had moved to the US to live with her aunt in New York City to learn English and do menial work. She almost gave up pursuing a career in music at this time, but her father convinced her that she could make it.",
      "While in the US Karol G also attended a music business conference in Boston, which she says was very helpful in helping her understand how the industry worked.",
      "She got her breakthrough hit single in 2017, the song Ahora Me Llama, which was a collaboration with Puerto Rican male artist Bad Bunny. Her first album Unstoppable then followed.",
      "Since then the hits have just kept on coming, and her 2023 album, Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito, was the first entirely Spanish-language release by a female artist to top the US album chart.",
      "Karol G's style of music is more often described as \"reggaeton\". This combines hip-hop with Latin American and Jamaican music, with the singing and rapping usually done in Spanish.",
      "While she is widely reported to be both hardworking and ambitious, Roc\u00edo Guerrero, head of Latin music at Amazon Music, says that the singer \u2013 and Latin music in general - have been greatly helped by the rise of streaming, both the music and the accompanying videos.",
      "\"Streaming democratised the landscape,\" says Ms Guerrero, explaining that it has allowed Latin music, which wasn't being played on mainstream radio stations to travel the world.",
      "\"Radio stations were local, but with streaming we brought together all of those audiences [around the globe]. It has given more opportunity to more Latin songs and artist to be exposed. Karol G is a perfect example of this evolution.\"",
      "Today on Amazon Music more than a third of Latin music is now consumed outside Latin America, and in the last three years alone the listenership for Karol G has grown by more than 250%.",
      "Meanwhile, in the US, Latin music is now the fastest-growing genre, hitting a record $1.4bn (\u00a31.1bn) in venues last year, according to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Streaming accounted for 98% of this.",
      "And this year, Karol's G's Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito album was the fourth most streamed globally on Spotify.",
      "This helped to boost interest in her 2023-24 sell-out, global Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito Tour. This grossed $307m in ticket sales. And while that figure is dwarfed by the $2bn achieved by Taylor Swift's Eras tour, Karol G's earnings were the highest for a female Latin artist.",
      "Carlos Balado, a professor at OBS Business School in Barcelona, analyses the economic impact of music concerts. He says that both Karol G and Taylor Swift have benefited from the increased popularity of going to such a big live event.",
      "\"There's a growing trend where the public considers that part of their normal spending has to go towards concerts,\" he adds.",
      "Leila Cobo, chief content officer for Latin/Espa\u00f1ol at US music magazine Billboard, which is also known for its music charts, says Karol G has helped to put Colombian music on the map.",
      "\"I think music is the biggest ambassador for Colombia. I really do,\" she says. \"And Karol G has tapped into this female Latin female fanbase who really didn't have someone like her. They wanted someone relatable, fun, sexy, had cool songs, but wasn't completely over the top.",
      "\"And reggaeton is super danceable, it's super consumable, it's super youth oriented,\" adds Ms Cobo, who is the author of a book on Latin music.",
      "Despite winning numerous awards and critical acclaim, Karol G has not been immune to criticism. Her lyrics have been slammed for being too raunchy, and critics have also taken aim at her for calling one of her songs \"Bichota\". This is a slang term meaning big shot or boss, and often associated with drugs and criminality.",
      "She argues that she repurposed the word to signify empowerment. As for her lyrics, her defenders say that rather than singing about and objectifying women, she sings on behalf of them.",
      "Karol G's estimated net worth had skyrocketed to $25m by 2023 according to Celebrity Net Worth - a figure that's likely increased substantially since her recent tour.",
      "Outside of music she earns money by collaborations with shoemaker Crocs, sportswear brand Kappa, Smirnoff vodka, and Spanish fashion label Loewe. Her name has also appeared on the front of FC Barcelona shirts as part of the football club's partnership with music streamer Spotify.",
      "Ms Cobo says: \"She's branching out. She's a very bright, inquisitive person and always looking to grow. And she's very aware that it's not just about music.\"",
      "Karol G's business ventures are controlled by her company Girl Power Inc, which also oversees her charity Con Cora Foundation.",
      "This aims to help improve the lives of underprivileged women and children across Latin America by giving educational scholarships to teenage mothers, supporting girls who want to go into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, providing financial aid to kids' football teams, and society-reintegration projects for female inmates.",
      "Meanwhile, Karol G launched her own record label in 2023, Bichota, to have more control over her music, which is subsequently distributed and promoted by US company Interscope, part of the giant Universal Music Group.",
      "Yet despite her global success, there are still markets she hasn't yet cracked - the UK, for example, where she's still not widely known. Britain has a small, but fast-growing Hispanic diaspora.",
      "However, Amazon's Ms Guerrero thinks it is only a matter of time before Karol G does break the British market. \"It's going to happen. It's just a matter of time,\" she says.",

    "summary": "The long-awaited decision follows a standoff with Meta, and succeeds a world-first law from 2021.",
    "story": [
      "Australia's government says it will create new rules to force big tech companies to pay local publishers for news.",
      "The long-awaited decision sets out a successor to a world-first law that Australia passed in 2021, which was designed to make giants like Meta and Google pay for hosting news on their platforms.",
      "Earlier this year Meta - which owns Facebook and Instagram - announced it would not renew payment deals it had in place with Australian news organisations, setting up a standoff with lawmakers.",
      "The new rules, announced on Thursday, will require firms that earn more than A$250m ($160m; \u00a3125m) in annual revenue to enter into commercial deals with media organisations, or risk being hit with higher taxes.",
      "The design of the scheme is yet to be finalised but it will apply to sites such as Facebook, Google and TikTok.",
      "In a statement, Meta said it was concerned that the government was \"charging one industry to subsidise another\".",
      "Unlike the previous model, the new framework - called the News Bargaining Incentive - will require tech firms to pay even if they do not enter deals with publishers.",
      "\"Digital platforms receive huge financial benefits from Australia and they have a social and economic responsibility to contribute to Australians' access to quality journalism,\" Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones said on Thursday.",
      "The previous News Media Bargaining Code saw news organisations negotiate commercial deals with tech giants, while also committing firms like Facebook and Google to invest millions of dollars in local digital content.",
      "That code aimed to address what the government called a power imbalance between publishers and tech companies, while offsetting some of the losses traditional media outlets have faced due to the rise of digital platforms.",
      "As deals brokered under that arrangement neared expiry, Meta said that it would not be renewing them, leading to a roughly A$200m loss in revenue for Australian publishers.",
      "Instead, Meta said it would phase out its dedicated news tab - which spotlights articles - on Facebook in Australia, and reinvest the money elsewhere.",
      "\"We know that people don't come to Facebook for news and political content\u2026 news makes up less than 3% of what people around the world see in their Facebook feed,\" it said in a statement in February.",
      "The announcement prompted a strong response from Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government, which described the move as \"a fundamental dereliction\" of Meta's \"responsibility to its Australian users\".",
      "\"The risk is that misinformation will fill any vacuum created by news no longer being on the platform,\" Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said at the time.",
      "The new taxation model begins in January 2025 and will be cemented into law once parliament returns in February.",
      "The government says it will be designed to make tech companies fund Australian journalism in exchange for tax offsets, not to raise revenue."

      "Ad\u00e8le Haenel, a French actor who has accused a filmmaker of sexually assaulting her when she was a child, shouted at him to \"shut up\" before storming out in the middle of his trial.",
      "Christophe Ruggia, 59, was speaking in his defence at the time, arguing he had merely tried to \"protect\" Haenel during the early days of her fame.",
      "A French prosecutor has requested two years of house arrest for Ruggia, 59, who Haenel has said assaulted her in the early 2000s when she was between 12 and 15 and he was in his late 30s.",
      "Ruggia has said the accusations of sexual molestation are \"pure lies\".",
      "He also accused Haenel of wanting to take revenge on him for not hiring her for any more roles after she starred in his 2002 film Les Diables (The Devils).",
      "Haenel has said she was controlled and manipulated by Ruggia when she was a child and that nobody protected her when she was \"asked to do things in the name of art\".",
      "She alleges that Ruggia started molesting her during the shoot, when she was 12.",
      "Haenel, who starred in the acclaimed 2019 film Portrait of a Lady on Fire, publicly quit the French film industry last year because of what she said was its \"general complacency\" towards sexual predators.",
      "In 2019, she gave a lengthy and emotional interview to French outlet Mediapart in which she detailed what she called the \"sexual harassment\" she suffered at Ruggia's hands.",
      "She said she had decided to speak out about her alleged abuse after watching the documentary Leaving Neverland, which explored the singer Michael Jackson's relationships with children.",
      "\"It made me see I had clung for too long to the version of Ruggia, that it had all been a story of love,\" she said, adding that it made her understand the mechanisms of \"control and fascination\".",
      "Haenel said that on set Ruggia would touch her constantly, kiss her on the cheek, put his hands on her hips and call her \"my darling\" and \"sweetie\", and that he progressively isolated her from her family, telling her parents not to come to the film set to avoid distracting her.",
      "Other actors and technicians on the set told Mediapart of the unhealthy atmosphere.",
      "A summary of the charges quoted by French media says Ruggia and Haenel continued to see each other every Saturday after the shooting of Les Diables wrapped up, \"under the guise of film lessons\" during which Ruggia would allegedly touch her sexually and put his hands in her underwear.",
      "Investigators said they had found notes on Ruggia's computer in which he wrote about 12-year-old Haenel's \"overflowing sensuality\".",
      "When she eventually cut off links with him, he kept writing her numerous letters, according to the charge sheet. She later plunged into a deep depression which lasted until she was 28, she said.",
      "\"When I was under his thumb I felt dirty and wanted to die,\" Haenel told investigators.",
      "Ruggia has admitted to having made \"errors\" in his conduct towards Haenel.",
      "\"I did not see that my adulation for her, and the hopes I placed in her, might - given her young age - come across at times as irksome. If this is what happened... I ask her pardon,\" he said in a statement in 2019.",
      "At the trial, prosecutor Camille Poch said she had \"no doubt\" the allegations were truthful and said Ruggia's defence was \"unlikely\". \"He made the choice to sexually assault her. He had his whole conscience as a grown man to decide to act otherwise.\"",
      "Haenel was the first prominent French actor to accuse the French film industry of turning a blind eye to sexual assault.",
      "Since then, actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu has been accused of rape and is due to stand trial next year. Film directors Beno\u00eet Jacquot and Jacques Doillon have also been accused of rape and sexual offences by actress Judith Godr\u00e8che.",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 12:09:18 GMT",
    "summary": "The actor plays Dylan in A Complete Unknown, which focuses on the singer's rise to fame in the 1960s.",
    "story": [
      "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet has been praised by critics for his portrayal of Bob Dylan, in a new film biopic of the US singer-songwriter.",
      "A Complete Unknown has already scored three Golden Globe nominations and is likely to be in the Oscars race in the new year.",
      "The Guardian said Chalamet showed \"amazing bravado\" in his performance, while Empire said the actor is \"superb\" and his \"musical talent is unimpeachable\".",
      "But the Independent said the biopic itself \"plays too safe\" and Screen Rant described the \"serviceable\" film as a \"fascinating yet frustrating\" portrait.",
      "A Complete Unknown is released on Christmas Day in the US, and 17 January in the UK.",
      "Dylan himself has endorsed the film, although he had not actually seen it at the time he posted about it last week on X.",
      "\"Timmy's a brilliant actor so I'm sure he's going to be completely believable as me. Or a younger me. Or some other me,\" Dylan said.",
      "In her three-star review, the Independent's Clarisse Loughrey said the film \"takes a reverent stance to Dylan's artistry, populated by technically accomplished musical performances\".",
      "She said Chalamet's voice \"isn't perfect, but it's undoubtedly impressive\", adding the film is \"shot with a real sensitivity to the emotional landscape of each track\".",
      "The film is based on Elijah Wald's 2015 book, Dylan Goes Electric!",
      "Set in the early 1960s, it tells the story of Dylan's rise to fame, and the conflict between his folk roots and his desire to expand his repertoire to include rock 'n' roll.",
      "The friction is represented by the choice between his use of an acoustic and electric guitar, and Dylan's lyrics gradually become bolder and more reflective of the world he sees around him.",
      "The film climaxes with a famously chaotic performance at at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965, where Dylan was booed by some members of the audience for playing an electric set with an amplified band.",
      "Deadline's Pete Hammond praised the film's production design, costumes and cinematography, as well as its lead performance.",
      "\"At the centre of this all is a remarkable performance by Chalamet, who performs all the songs himself in astonishing and authentic fashion. There is no lip-syncing or blending of voices between actor and subject,\" he noted.",
      "\"The music of course is worth the price of admission, but in Mangold's hands fortunately there is so much more to add, thus making Bob Dylan a little less than complete unknown by the time the credits roll.\"",
      "The film also follows Dylan's romantic relationships with two women in particular - civil rights activist Sylvie Russo (played by Elle Fanning) and folk musician Joan Baez (Monica Barbaro).",
      "Screen Rant's Mae Abdulbaki reflected: \"I could understand both women more clearly than Chalamet's Dylan. Behind his sunglasses and tight body language, Dylan remains elusive.",
      "\"The film is very much about an artist who doesn't explain himself, and I have immense respect for that, but it also creates an emotional disconnect in narrative form. It was as though I was watching a series of events that I couldn't bring myself to care about. That's what Mangold risks by keeping Dylan out of reach.\"",
      "There was a rave review from the Guardian's Peter Bradshaw, who awarded the film five stars and praised Chalamet's \"hilarious and seductive portrayal\".",
      "\"Interestingly the story, despite the classic music-biopic tropes that Mangold did so much to popularise, does not conform to the classic rise-fall-learning-experience-comeback format,\" he said. It's all rise, but troubled and unclear.\"",
      "The Times Kevin Maher was far less enthusiastic, awarding just two stars",
      "\"There will be audiences who will regard the recreation of Newport '65 as a monumental cinematic event. But for many it will land with a giant shrug of indifference,\" he noted.",
      "\"[Chalamet's] performance is an unhelpful study in blank-eyed lockjaw minimalism, while his singing voice is fine if, occasionally, close to parody (but all Dylan imitators sound like parody).\"",
      "With an acclaimed back catalogue built up over seven decades, Dylan is best known for hits such as Blowin in the Wind, Mr. Tambourine Man, It Ain't Me Babe, Girl From The North Country and The Times They Are a Changin'.",
      "\"Perhaps Dylan himself is too mercurial a figure for a biopic to ever capture him completely,\" wrote the Telegraph's Robbie Collin in a four-star review. \"A Complete Unknown comes about as close as one could reasonably hope.",
      "\"For the most part, the film plays like a juicy rise-to-power drama rather than a scenic tour of an artist's Wikipedia page.\"",
      "Elsewhere, the Evening Standard's Nick Curtis joked the film made him \"really, really want to learn to play harmonica\".",
      "\"It's a defiantly unlikeable performance, miles away from Chalamet's romantic leads,\" Curtis noted.",
      "\"He captures Dylan's craning stance and the way he used hair and sunglasses as a mask, the insistent buzz and keen of his speaking and singing voice and the odd, touchy, insularity.\"",
      "A Complete Unknown also stars Edward Norton and is directed by James Mangold, the filmmaker behind Johnny Cash biopic Walk The Line and films in the X-Men and Indiana Jones franchises.",
      "The Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney added: \"Commendably, neither the movie nor the actor sugarcoat the abrasiveness of a creative genius whose insensitivity toward people close to him often stands in stark contrast to the humanity in his songs.\"",
      "\"That detachment leaves something of a hole where the emotional centre should be in the screenplay by Mangold and Jay Cocks. Making a film about an enigmatic subject is inherently challenging and the writers deserve credit for declining to try to solve the mystery of Bob Dylan, even if that also risks making them seem incurious.\"",
      "Empire's John Nugent concluded: \"Frustratingly, for a story about a poetic genius, it struggles to find something fresh to say.",
      "\"There is some interesting stuff about the burden of talent... But by 1965 he is almost always behind sunglasses, his enigma calcified.",
      "\"The film doesn't claim to understand Dylan, and suggests Dylan might not understand himself, either. That title, it seems, is literal.\"",

      "His lawyers have characterised the multiple civil lawsuits, including the claims of 300 potential victims, as a part of a \"reckless media circus\".",
      "They said Mr Buzbee's press conference, and the creation of a toll-free phone number for tip-offs, were \"clear attempts to garner publicity\".",

      "\"In court, the truth will prevail: That Mr. Combs never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone - man or woman, adult or minor.\"",
      "The musician is currently being held in Manhattan's Metropolitan Detention Center, awaiting trial on separate criminal charges of sex trafficking and racketeering, which he also denies.",
      "Who is Tony Buzbee?",
      "Mr Buzbee, whose practice is based in Houston, is an outsized character in US legal circles, once described by the New York Times as \"a big, mean, ambitious, tenacious, fire-breathing Texas trial lawyer\".",

      "His involvement with Mr Combs began last year - after his co-counsel Andrew Van Arsdale, who previously represented hundreds of victims in a sexual abuse lawsuit against the Boy Scouts of America, began receiving calls about the star.",
      "\u201cI think he got a little bit overwhelmed, and he realised that this might be more than he could handle [on his own]\u201d, Buzbee says.",

      "Lawyers for Mr Combs have denied the allegations, saying in a statement to the BBC that he \"has never sexually assaulted anyone - adult or minor, man or woman\".",
      "The lawsuits have so far been filed anonymously, with the alleged victims referred to in court documents as John Doe or Jane Doe.",

      "In an extensive statement, Jay-Z, whose real name is Shawn Carter, called the claims \"idiotic\" and accused Mr Buzbee of attempting to blackmail him by threatening to make his name public.",

      "There have also been widely-discredited fakes, including a tell-all biography purportedly written by Mr Combs' late partner, Kim Porter; and a viral song, in which Justin Bieber purportedly sang, \"I lost myself at a Diddy party\". The latter turned out to be an AI-generated fake.",
      "Lawyers for Mr Combs have argued that the number of \"false and outrageous\" claims being made by \"government agents, plaintiffs' attorneys, and others with questionable motives\" could be \"perceived as prejudicing potential jurors\".",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 17:59:30 GMT",
    "summary": "Demi Agoglia, 26, travelled to Turkey after seeing social media adverts for the butt lift procedure.",
    "story": [
      "A mum of three who died after a Brazilian butt lift (BBL) procedure had undergone a \"frankly barbaric medical practice\" in which she gave no informed consent, a coroner has concluded.",
      "Demi Agoglia, from Salford, had travelled to Turkey for the procedure in January after seeing social media adverts for Comfort Zone, based in Istanbul.",
      "The 26-year-old died in a hospital in Istanbul on 8 January three days after the operation and a catalogue of poor care, an inquest heard.",
      "Bolton coroner John Pollard found she died from a microscopic fat embolism, caused when injected fat enters the bloodstream, and ruled she died as a result of \"misadventure contributed to by neglect\".",
      "Her mother, Christine Tydd, said she had told her daughter she was a \"good looking girl\" and did not need the operation shortly before she travelled to Turkey on 4 January with her partner, Bradley Jones.",
      "\"She was conscious about the way she looked. There was no changing her mind,\" she told the hearing.",
      "Landscaper Mr Jones said he also did not want Ms Agoglia to have the surgery, but she had booked the trip months earlier after \"she had seen some celebrity\" advertising the procedure.",
      "The BBL procedure sees fat taken from elsewhere on the body and injected into the hips and buttocks.",
      "Mr Pollard said: \"I find there was no proper informed consent in this matter, there was no proper pre-operative care and advice, and no proper post-operative care.",
      "\"All of this meant the care in total fell well below the standard expected of this type of treatment and the lack of care contributed significantly to Demi's death.\"",
      "The day after the surgery, Ms Agoglia told her mum: \"I've got the bum I always wanted\".",
      "The next day her mum got a text from her partner saying: \"She's gone.\"",
      "Mr Jones told the inquest that following the operation Ms Agoglia was \"shaking\" and appeared \"very, very cold\".",
      "Staff from Comfort Zone, who the coroner said it later emerged were not qualified nurses, were called to the villa Ms Agoglia was staying in after she complained of a tight chest.",
      "They checked her blood pressure but did not inspect the area of the operation or check her heart rate and pulse, the inquest heard.",
      "Ms Agoglia collapsed at the villa the following day and was taken back to hospital where she died.",
      "'Felt she wasn't good enough'",
      "Her sister, Chloe, said in a statement read by a family friend, Ellie Foulkes, outside court, that the family were going through \"the worst possible heartbreak\".",
      "\"Our Demi was a beautiful, outgoing, very confident girl and she didn't need the surgery at all.",
      "\"She went for the sake of her feeling like she wasn't good enough in herself,\" she said.",
      "\"Our Demi hasn't just left her family behind she has left the most beautiful little boys.",
      "\"Forever and always in our heart Demi.\"",
      "She added: \"Sleep tight.\"",
      "She urged people to do \"more research\" if they were thinking of going to Turkey for surgery.",
      "But a spokesman for Comfort Zone said Ms Agoglia was \"thoroughly informed of the risks involved with cosmetic surgery\" and said claims staff were unqualified were \"categorically untrue\".",
      "The coroner told Ms Agoglia's family he would write to Health Secretary Wes Streeting.",
      "\"I do feel something further needs to be done to stop this frankly barbaric medical practice being conducted to such low standards that would certainly not be tolerated in the UK,\" he added.",
      "A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: \"Our thoughts are with Demi's family and friends at this difficult time.",
      "\"It is unacceptable that people's lives are being put at risk by inadequately trained operators in the cosmetic sector. The government is urgently exploring options for further regulations in this area.",

    "published": "Thu, 12 Dec 2024 03:08:22 GMT",
    "summary": "For the first time, the annual report delved into race and ethnic data of those who underwent assisted dying.",
    "story": [
      "The rate of medical assistance in dying - also known as euthanasia - has grown in Canada for the fifth straight year, albeit at a slower pace.",
      "The country released its fifth annual report since legalising assisted dying in 2016, which for the first time included data on the ethnicity of those seeking euthanasia.",
      "Around 15,300 people underwent assisted dying last year, accounting for 4.7% of deaths in the country. Canada lawmakers are currently seeking to expand access to euthanasia to cover people with mental illnesses by 2027.",
      "Canada is among a few countries that have introduced assisted dying laws in the past decade. Others include Australia, New Zealand, Spain, Austria.",
      "The figures released on Wednesday by Health Canada show that the rate of assisted dying in Canada increased by nearly 16% in 2023. This number is a sharp drop from the average increase of 31% in previous years.",
      "The report cautioned that it is too early to determine what caused the rate to slacken.",
      "Nearly all of those who requested assisted dying - around 96% - had a foreseeable natural death. The remaining 4% were granted euthanasia due to having a long-term chronic illness and where a natural death was not imminent.",
      "The average age of those seeking assisted dying was around 77 years old, with cancer being the most frequent underlying medical condition.",
      "For the first time, the report delved into race and ethnic data of those who died by euthanasia.",
      "Around 96% of recipients identified as white people, who account for about 70% of Canada's population. It is unclear what caused this disparity.",
      "The second most reported ethnic group was east Asians (1.8%), who account for about 5.7% of Canadians.",
      "Assisted dying continued to have the highest usage rate in Quebec, which accounted for nearly 37% of all euthanasia deaths, despite the province holding just 22% of Canada's population.",
      "Quebec's government launched a study earlier this year to examine why its euthanasia rate was so high.",
      "While the number of assisted deaths in Canada is growing, the country still falls behind the Netherlands, where euthanasia accounted for around 5% of total deaths last year.",
      "UK MPs voted late last month to pass a similar bill that gives terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to have an assisted death, though it will face months of further scrutiny before it could become law.",
      "As British MPs debated the legislation, Canada was cited by some as a cautionary tale due to its perceived lack of safeguards.",
      "Like the UK, Canada initially only legalised assisted dying for those whose death was \"reasonably foreseeable\".",
      "However, Canada expanded access in 2021 to people who may not have a terminal diagnosis, but want to end their life because of a chronic, debilitating condition.",
      "It was set to broaden access once again to people with mental illnesses earlier this year.",
      "But that was delayed for the second time after concerns were raised by Canadian provinces, which oversee healthcare delivery, about whether the system could cope with such an expansion.",
      "On Wednesday, Health Canada defended the procedure, saying that the criminal code sets out \"strict eligibility\" criteria.",
      "But Cardus, a Christian think tank, said the latest figures were \"alarming\" and showed Canada has one of the fastest growing euthanasia programmes in the world.",
      "A report released in October by Ontario - Canada's most populous province - has since shed some light on controversial cases where people were granted assisted dying when they were not nearing their natural death.",
      "One example included a woman in her 50s with a history of depression and suicidal thoughts who had a severe sensitivity to chemicals.",
      "Her request for euthanasia was granted after she failed to secure housing that could have met her medical needs.",
      "Another case made headlines in recent months of a Nova Scotia cancer patient who said she was asked if she was aware of assisted dying as an option twice as she underwent mastectomy surgeries.",
      "The question \"came up in completely inappropriate places\", she told the National Post.",

    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 00:43:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The government has pledged to determine the evidence - and establish whether the benefits outweigh any potential harms of prescribing puberty blockers to children questioning their gender",
    "story": [
      "It is among the most delicate and controversial challenges in modern medicine - how to determine whether the benefits of puberty blockers (or drugs that delay puberty) outweigh the potential harms.",
      "This question came to the fore in June 2023 when NHS England proposed that in the future, these drugs would only be prescribed to children questioning their gender as part of clinical research.",
      "Since then, a new government has arrived in Westminster and Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said he is committed to \"setting up a clinical trial\" to establish the evidence on puberty blockers. The National Institute for Health and Care Research is expected to confirm soon that funding is in place for a trial.",
      "The dilemma that remains is, how will such a trial work?",
      "Eighteen months since the announcement there is still a lack of consensus around how the trial should be conducted. It will also need to be approved by a committee of experts who have to decide, among other things, whether what's being tested might cause undue physical or psychological harm.",
      "But there is a second unanswered question that some, but by no means all, scientists have that is more pressing than the first: is it right to perform this particular trial on children and young people at all?",
      "A rapid rise in referrals",
      "When the Gender and Identity Development Service (GIDS) was established at London's Tavistock Clinic in 1989, it was the only NHS specialist gender clinic for children in England, and those referred there were typically offered psychological and social support.",
      "Over the last 10 years, however, there has been a rapid increase in referrals - with the greatest increase being people registered female at birth. In a separate development, around the same time the approach of typically offering psychological and social support moved to one of onward referrals to services that prescribed hormone drugs, such as puberty blockers.",
      "Known scientifically as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, puberty blockers work on the brain to stop the rise in sex hormones - oestrogen and testosterone - that accompany puberty. For years, they were prescribed to young patients with gender dysphoria (those who feel their gender identity is different from their biological sex). But in March 2024, NHS England stopped the routine prescribing of puberty blockers to under 18s, as part of an overhaul of children's gender identity services.",
      "NHS England said in a policy statement: \"There is not enough evidence to support the safety or clinical effectiveness of PSH [puberty suppressing hormones] to make the treatment routinely available at this time.\"",
      "The ban was later tightened to apply to private clinics as well.",
      "In April 2024, a review of gender identity services for children and young people, led by Dr Hilary Cass, a past president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, published its final report, which called out the \"field of gender care\" for not taking a cautious and careful approach.",
      "She also reported that the change in practice at GIDS away from one primarily relying on psychological and social support was largely based on a single study that looked at the effect of medical interventions such as puberty blockers on a very narrowly defined group of children and there was a lack of follow up in the longer term.",
      "Elsewhere, some other countries were re-examining puberty blockers too. Scotland paused the use of them while Finland, Sweden, France, Norway, and Denmark have all re-evaluated their positions on medical intervention for under 18s - including puberty blockers - to differing degrees. In other places there is still support for the use of puberty blockers.",
      "In medicine, when there is genuine uncertainty as to whether the benefits of a treatment outweigh the harms - called equipoise - some ethicists argue there's a moral obligation to scientifically study such treatments. But there are some from across the debate who don't think there is equipoise in this case.",
      "The ethical dilemma at the heart of the trial",
      "The BBC has learned details about the arguments going on around the concept of a trial and how it could look. Some argue that there is already evidence that puberty blockers can help with mental health, and that in light of this it would be unethical to perform a trial at all because this would mean some young people experiencing gender distress would not be given them.",
      "The World Professional Association of Transgender Health (WPATH) has expressed their concern about the trial for this reason. They support the use of puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and surgery. WPATH, who have faced increasing criticism of their guidelines from some clinicians, say that it is ethically problematic to make participation in a trial the only way to access a type of care that is \"evidence based, widely recognised as medically necessary, and often reported as lifesaving.\"",
      "Meanwhile other clinicians believe there is no good evidence that puberty blockers can help with mental health at all. They also point to research that questions the negative impact that the drugs might have on brain development among teenagers, as well as evidence around the negative impact on bone density.",
      "Dr Louise Irvine is a GP and co-chair of the Clinical Advisory Network on Sex and Gender which says it is cautious about using medical pathways in gender dysphoric children. She says: \"Given that puberty blockers by definition disrupt a crucial natural phase of human development, the anticipated benefits must be tangible and significant to justify the risk to children.",
      "\"In pushing ahead with a puberty blockers trial, we are concerned that political interests are being prioritised over clinical, ethical and scientific concerns, and over the health and wellbeing of children.\"",
      "The NHS adult gender services holds data that tracks 9,000 young people from the youth service. Some argue that this should be scrutinised before any trial goes ahead as it could provide evidence on, among other things, the potential risks of taking puberty blockers.",
      "But there is a third view held by some others, including Gordon Guyatt, a professor at McMaster University in Canada, who points out that randomised trials are done in \"life-threatening stuff all the time\" where no-one can be sure of the long-term effects of a treatment. In his view it would be \"unethical not to do it\".",
      "\"With only low quality evidence, people's philosophies, their attitudes or their politics, will continue to dominate the discussion,\" he argues. \"If we do not generate better evidence, the destructive, polarised debate will continue.\"",
      "- Dr Cass found the existing research in the field was poor quality and that there was not a reliable enough evidence base to base clinical decisions on. Young people involved in many of the existing studies may have also had interventions including psychological support and other medical treatments and so it was not always possible to disentangle the effect of each different treatment.",
      "- When it comes to suppressing puberty by using drugs, the rationale for doing so \"remains unclear\", Dr Cass said.  One of the original reasons given was to allow time to think by delaying the onset of puberty. But the evidence suggests the vast majority who start on puberty blockers go on to take cross-sex hormones - oestrogen or testosterone. It is not clear why but one theory, the Cass report suggests, is that puberty blockers may, in their own right, change the \"trajectory\" of gender identity development.",
      "- Clinicians \"are unable to determine with any certainty\" which young people \"will go on to have an enduring trans identity\", Dr Cass wrote. In other words, there's a lack of clarity about which young people might benefit in the long term and which may be harmed overall by the process.",
      "How the trial could look",
      "Recruitment for the trial is due to start in 2025, months later than originally anticipated. Young people will likely be referred after a full assessment by specialist clinicians. A lot is still to be determined, including how many participants there will be.",
      "Ultimately the scientists running the trials will need to establish whether people who get an intervention are better off than those who do not. In this case, do the puberty blocking drugs and their effect make the young people better off?",
      "\"Better off\" in this instance includes the extent to which a young person's mental health may be improved if they are happy with their body. Quality of life is determined by various factors including self-confidence and self-esteem. As well as getting the personal views from the young people and parents, the trial could measure actual real life changes, such as time spent in education and time spent with family and friends.",
      "But there are potential harms to study too, such as the possibility of reduced bone density. Some scientists suggest examining the impact on learning using a form of IQ test.",
      "Normal brain development is influenced by both puberty and chronological age, which usually act in tandem during adolescence. It's not clear how this is affected when puberty is suppressed. Brain scans are one way of understanding any effect.",
      "Some scientists believe it may be possible to simply randomly assign trial participants into two groups where one gets puberty blockers, the other gets a placebo and nobody is aware which group they're in.",
      "But others believe a placebo group is impossible. They say the placebo group would go through puberty, realise they weren't on puberty blockers and potentially drop out of the trial or even find other ways to obtain puberty blockers. Either scenario would reduce the validity of the results.",
      "Professor Gordon Guyatt and others have outlined a potential trial where the group of patients not receiving drugs would be made up entirely of children who are keen to socially transition, such as by changing how they dress and altering their name and pronouns. Researchers could then monitor the difference between the groups.",
      "A second possibility is that both trial groups are given puberty blockers but one group gets them after a delay, during which time they receive psychological and emotional support. This would help researchers determine, among other things, whether their gender-related distress subsides during that delay while receiving the support.",
      "Alongside this there would be a \"matched\" control group that doesn't take a placebo or puberty blockers, whether for health reasons or because they don't want to, that get similar tests and scans.",
      "Puberty occurs in stages when different bodily changes occur. A third proposal could involve a second group being given drugs at a later stage in puberty than the first.",
      "This would allow researchers to explore when the right time to give puberty blockers might be. For example, it would enable the researchers to see if starting the drugs early improves wellbeing by reducing gender-specific body changes. They would also be able to see whether starting the drugs earlier has a greater negative impact on bone density and brain development.",
      "Children referred to GIDS also experienced higher rates of anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and autism compared to the general child population. Trial participants would continue to receive treatment related to these conditions but - so we know any differences in the results from the groups are down to the drug - they will need to be balanced for the above conditions.",
      "All these considerations demonstrate the complexity of trying to obtain evidence in this area that is reliable and definitive.",
      "What parents say",
      "Many parents are watching closely to see how it will play out. Annabel (not her real name) is one of them. She is part of the Bayswater Group, a collection of parents with children who are questioning their gender who say they are \"wary of medical solutions to gender dysphoria\". She began looking into puberty blockers when her own daughter began questioning her gender in her early teens, an option put on the table by GIDS.",
      "Ultimately her daughter decided not to take them. Annabel was not convinced there was enough evidence to show they were beneficial and she was unsure what it would mean for her daughter's long-term physical and psychological health.",
      "Today, she still has unanswered questions - including some further ones around the trial. \"A big concern for me is will this new trial, if it gets approval, give us the evidence that we want? Or will we end up with more weak data that Dr Cass said undermined decision making in this area?\"",
      "Natacha Kennedy, a lecturer at Goldsmiths, University of London who researches transgender issues, has examined the results of a survey of 97 parents of young people with gender-related distress that took place following the puberty blockers ban. She believes that puberty blockers should be an option available for young people questioning their gender and that many will not accept being part of a placebo group in a trial.",
      "\"These parents are desperate and if [they] get to a trial and it turns out their child is not being given the actual puberty blockers, then there is no point in them being there,\" she says.",
      "\"There may be some parents who would\u2026 find another way [to obtain the drugs].\"",
      "Why these Israeli men volunteered to fight - but now refuse to return to Gaza",
      "'I spent 30 years as a therapist to killers - and no-one is born evil'",
      "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",
      "Whatever trial format is settled on, more scrutiny will follow. And there will no doubt be fierce debate about the merits of the trial and what it can tell us, as many scientists around the world are watching to see what happens in the UK.",
      "But inevitably, there will be a long wait to fully understand the longer term effects on physical and mental health of those who take puberty blockers - and the long-term effects on those with gender-related distress who don't. Nor do we know how many people detransition, though the Cass report says, \"there is suggestion that numbers are increasing\".",
      "\"We really need to have long-term follow up,\" argues Annabel. \"Can a child possibly understand what that means to their fertility and a loss of sexual function and what that will mean for their future life?\"",
      "For now, she and the scores of parents, carers and young people, can only watch and wait for the trial to begin and for its verdict - and what that means for whether puberty blockers will be prescribed to children once again in the future.",

    "story": [
      "The government is not \"waging war on rural England\" with plans to force councils to allow more homes to be built in their areas, the housing minister has said.",
      "Matthew Pennycook hit back at Conservative claims the government was \"concreting over\" green belt land.",
      "He told MPs new housing targets for local councils were focused on parts of the country where housing was least affordable - and it was \"wrong\" to say rural areas would bear the brunt of the changes.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has made increasing housebuilding a key priority, promising 1.5 million new homes in England over the next five years.",
      "\"Our plan for change will put builders not blockers first, overhaul the broken planning system and put roofs over the heads of working families and drive the growth that will put more money in people's pockets,\" said the PM.",
      "However, councils, including some Labour-run authorities, have previously raised concerns higher housing targets will be almost impossible to achieve.",
      "They point to strains on local infrastructure, land shortages and a lack of capacity in the construction industry as among the constraints on housebuilding.",

      "Councils will also be ordered to review green belt boundaries - which were created to prevent urban sprawl - by identifying lower-quality \"grey belt\" land that can be built on.",
      "Building on green belt land, which is higher quality, will be allowed if other options have been exhausted - but it must comply with a set of \"golden rules,\" the government said.",
      "Developers will need to prioritise necessary infrastructure, such as nurseries and GP surgeries, as well as guarantee affordable housing and access to green spaces.",
      "It is still not clear what will count as grey belt land.",
      "The government has previously given disused petrol stations and car parks as examples.",
      "It gave some further explanation in the document, such as land that does not preserve the character of historic towns - but councils will have to wait until the new year for full guidance.",
      "Pennycook said the government had listened to feedback from councils who wanted housing to be better targeted at areas where affordability pressures were most acute.",
      "London, the south-east and east of England now have higher housing targets than those proposed by the government in July, while the targets for other regions are lower.",
      "However, Conservative shadow housing secretary Kevin Hollinrake said: \"This planning framework pushes development to rural areas, concreting over green belt, green fields and over our green and pleasant land, rather than focusing on supporting building in urban areas, where we need to build the most.\"",
      "He added that it was \"vital\" homes were built in the right places with the right infrastructure and the government would \"bulldoze through the concerns of local communities\".",
      "Craig Bennett, chief executive of the Wildlife Trusts, said there was a danger the environment could suffer from plans to boost housebuilding.",
      "He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it would be \"a colossal, historic missed opportunity\" to build new homes \"in a way that destroys nature, rather than at the same time, restores and rebuilds our natural infrastructure\".",
      "Overall, councils are being told they must reach a combined target of 370,000 new homes a year \u2013 although the government has not set a date for when this will be achieved.",
      "There is an expectation that not all the homes planned for by this target will be delivered within five years.",
      "The government has also promised \u00a3100m of extra funds for councils and 300 additional planning officers to speed up decision-making processes.",
      "It said local authorities would have 12 weeks to come up with timetables for new housebuilding plans or risk intervention from ministers.",
      "The Local Government Association (LGA) said tackling local housing challenges would require a \"collaborative approach\" between councils and the government.",
      "Councils and communities who know their local areas well are \"best placed to make judgement decisions on how to manage competing demand for land,\" LGA spokesman Adam Hug said."

      "Those costs break down as \u00a312m from increased National Insurance contributions, \u00a39m from the rise in the National Living Wage, \u00a32m from business rates due to inflation, and \u00a39m from its supply chain hiking costs due to wages and tax, the firm said in its first-half results.",
      "\"The unwelcome headwinds from UK government policy... [will] add cost quickly and materially, depress investment and hiring, boost automation and offshoring, and make some price rises inevitable,\" said Mr Baldock.",

      "Last month Currys was one of the firms behind a letter from major UK retailers to the chancellor saying that High Street job losses were \"inevitable\", prices would rise, and shops would close because of tax increases in the Budget and other rising costs.",

So far, they have pushed the SDF out of Tal Rifaat and Manbij, and Syrian Kurds fear that more of the areas they control will now come under attack.",

    "story": [
      "Germany will tighten its law to make it easier to prosecute those helping to smuggle migrants to the UK, as part of a new plan agreed between the two countries.",
      "Facilitating people-smuggling is not technically illegal in Germany currently, if it is to a third country outside the EU - which, following Brexit, includes the UK.",
      "Under the new agreement, the Home Office says Germany has pledged to make the activity a clear criminal offence.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the \"ground-breaking\" agreement would help tackle the criminal gangs organising small boat crossings.",
      "The Conservatives said the plan did not \"go far enough\" and would not provide the deterrent necessary to reduce crossings.",
      "Earlier this year, a five-month long BBC investigation exposed the significant German connection to small boat crossings in the Channel, with people-smugglers operating in the west German city of Essen.",
      "The new joint UK-German agreement comes as the Home Office's own Border Security Command warns that Channel crossings \"are the most dangerous they have ever been\".",
      "Charlie Eastaugh, director of international operations at the command, told the BBC: \"We've seen tyre inner tubes being used in place of life jackets, it's extraordinarily dangerous, they are death traps.",
      "How many people cross the Channel in small boats?",
      "Ministers know they have to tackle small boat crossings",
      "\u2018Death trap\u2019 Channel boats traded by smugglers in German city - BBC undercover",
      "\"There are fewer boats and fewer engines in supply, we have seized over 450 boats and engines across Europe - and organised crime gangs are taking greater risks.",
      "\"We're seeing increased numbers in these boats because of the disruptive work we have carried out with our law enforcement partners in Europe.\"",
      "Miguel Berger, the German ambassador to the UK, said it was already effectively illegal to smuggle people towards the UK as they would have to go through an EU country like France or Belgium.",
      "\"If we also cooperate in the countries of transit and origin, I think we can jointly put a lot of pressure on these criminal networks,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday.",
      "More than 33,000 have crossed the English Channel by small boat this year, which is higher than the 29,000 last year, but below the record numbers in 2022.",
      "More than 70 people have died trying to make the crossing this year this year, and the average number of people per boat has risen to 53 compared with 10 back in 2019.",
      "After coming into power in July, the Labour government ditched the previous Conservative government's plan to deter crossings by sending to Rwanda those making the journey.",
      "Instead Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said his government would focus on tackling the criminal gangs arranging the crossings.",
      "As part of that approach, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has signed an agreement with Germany's Interior Minister Nancy Faeser, committing to co-operation on tackling people smuggling.",
      "The Joint Action Plan includes Germany's intention to make clear that activities facilitating migrant-smuggling to the UK will be deemed criminal offences.",
      "It also commits both countries to \"exchanging expertise with a special focus on removing migrant-smuggling content from social media platforms\".",
      "The UK government said: \"Once enacted, this anticipated law change is expected to significantly increase the number of prosecutions made in relation to migrant smuggling.\"",
      "In October, the BBC uncovered the activities of small boat smugglers based in Germany, including how they used multiple secret warehouses to evade the German police.",
      "At the time, one UK Home Office source told the BBC there was \"frustration\" about Germany's legal framework, which did not technically consider the arranging of  people smuggling to countries outside of the EU to be illegal.",
      "Speaking on Monday, Cooper said the partnership would help the UK go after the gangs who had been \"getting away with it for too long\".",
      "Faeser said it would \"help us end the inhumane activities of criminal migrant smuggling organisations\".",
      "\"Many of these crimes are planned in Germany. Together, we are now countering this unscrupulous business with even more resolve.\"",
      "Responding to the announcement, Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said: \"The British public deserves a serious plan to control our borders and stop criminal gangs.",
      "\"The National Crime Agency has said a deterrent is necessary to reduce the number of crossings, yet Labour scrapped the only deterrent before it even got started.",
      "\"Meanwhile the numbers of illegal immigrants coming here continue to climb, with an 18% increase compared to the same period last year, with more than 20,000 people having made the crossing since the election.\"",
      "The plan was signed ahead of a meeting of the Calais Group in London on Tuesday, a grouping of northern European countries focused on tackling illegal migration.",
      "Cooper was joined by ministers and police from Germany, as well as from France, Belgium and the Netherlands, to discuss migration in Europe.",
      "Sir Keir has said he wants to reduce both regular and irregular migration but has avoided setting a target for cutting numbers, arguing that an \"arbitrary\" cap would not work.",
      "Privately, Labour ministers acknowledged that tackling irregular migration would be key to how they are judged by voters.",

      "Waiting lists in Wales are at record levels and growing, A&Es and the ambulance service are braced for another difficult winter.",
      "The costs of medicines continue to rise and the maintenance backlog cost for NHS buildings is estimated to be more than \u00a3750m.",
      "Meanwhile Welsh health boards project their combined deficits will be around \u00a3221m at the end of this financial year - so the extra cash could be swallowed up very quickly.",
      "But there are other risks in prioritising spending on health above other Welsh government departments - many of which have faced substantial cuts in recent budgets.",
      "Experts warn if not enough money is spent on services like housing, leisure, and early years support for children - which help people live healthier lives in the first place - it could lead to even more pressure on the health service down the line.",
      "And that's a concern considering health and care now consumes around 56% of the Welsh government's day to day spending budget - much higher than 36%  at the start of devolution 25 years ago."

      "Reform UK has unveiled billionaire property developer - and former Conservative donor - Nick Candy as its treasurer, with the job of raising big money to fight the next general election.",
      "It is the latest in a series of announcements by Nigel Farage's party aimed at showing it is serious about winning power.",
      "Candy, who is married to Australian singer and actress Holly Valance, who also supports Reform, made his money by buying and renovating properties with his brother Christian.",
      "The pair were privately educated, and bought their first property in London in 1995, using a \u00a36,000 loan from their grandmother. They have never disclosed their wealth, but describe themselves as \"self-made billionaires\".",
      "The property tycoon was close to former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, donating more than \u00a3270,000 to the Conservative Party under his leadership and attending the then-PM's wedding.",
      "Now he says Farage could win the next general election - and is promising to raise \"tens of millions\" for Reform UK, telling journalists he will donate a \"seven figure sum\" of his own cash as well.",
      "\"This country needs change and I believe the person to make that change is Nigel Farage and I believe he'll be the next prime minister of this country,\" he said as he was unveiled to the cameras at Westminster.",

      "Former Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns joins Reform UK",
      "Reform to challenge Labour at Senedd poll - Farage",
      "Elon Musk has expressed interest in Candy's appointment, amid speculation the billionaire owner of X is looking into offering Farage's party a large donation.",
      "Candy said he and Musk exchanged messages following the announcement on Tuesday morning, but the new Reform UK treasurer refused to be drawn on any negotiations.",
      "When he was quizzed about the Donald Trump-supporting tycoon, Farage said: \"We don't know anything about Elon Musk other than he is supportive of our position.\"",
      "But he joked: \"If people offer us money legally, we'll take it.\"",
      "Businesses or individuals have to be registered in the UK to donate to a political party, raising questions about how the South African-born US citizen could give money to Reform.",
      "Farage denies Reform UK is becoming a party of millionaires and billionaires, saying the fundraising drive is about getting on an \"even financial footing\" with the other main parties.",
      "\"If we do that we will achieve extraordinary things,\" he added.",
      "As well as cash, Reform UK has been gaining valuable contacts in Westminster.",
      "Last week former Johnson adviser Tim Montgomerie, a veteran Tory commentator who founded the influential Conservative Home website, announced he was defecting to the party, citing immigration as a policy failure he could not forgive.",
      "Farage has a patchy record when it comes to high-profile signings. In his former life as UKIP leader he managed to fall out with figures such as TV personality Robert Kilroy-Silk, Tory defector Douglas Carswell and former EU auditor Marta Andreasen, shortly after unveiling them amid much fanfare.",
      "But he has also managed to attract wealthy backers in the past, such as insurance tycoon Arron Banks, who bankrolled his Brexit campaign.",
      "He is positioning Reform UK as the party for voters hungry for change - a platform Labour won a landslide election victory on just over five months ago.",
      "But Sir Keir Starmer's decision to make difficult and unpopular decisions at the start of his premiership, along with a number of unforced errors, has seen Labour's popularity plummet, as Reform's has risen.",
      "Reform UK sits comfortably in third place ahead of the Liberal Democrats in national opinion polls, and is narrowing the gap with the two main parties.",
      "The fledgling party proved incapable of transforming the size of its support into seats at Westminster in July.",
      "The Liberal Democrats won 3.5 million votes and 72 MPs through their highly-targeted campaign, whereas Reform UK picked up just over four million votes, but only five seats.",
      "Farage is on a mission to learn from the Lib Dems how to make Westminster's first-past-the-post voting system work for his party.",
      "Reform UK's new multi-millionaire chairman Zia Yusuf has taken on the job of \"professionalising\" the party - no easy task when it has attracted so much controversy in its short life with its choice of candidates in particular.",
      "Farage has faced questions over James McMurdock, the Reform MP for South Basildon and East Thurrock, who has a spent conviction after assaulting his girlfriend in 2006.",
      "The party has said it was aware of the previous conviction when McMurdock was selected as a candidate, and believes \"strongly that people can change their lives\".",
      "But Reform UK is pledging to vet candidates more thoroughly ahead of next year's local elections in an attempt to avoid embarrassment.",
      "One target is the new mayoral seat in Greater Lincolnshire, where former Conservative MP Andrea Jenkyns has been revealed as the party's candidate.",
      "Reform has so far been seen largely as a threat to the Conservatives - but on the day after the general election, Farage made their strategy clear when he declared: \"We're coming for Labour\".",
      "The big parties will be watching Reform UK's recent flurry of announcements nervously - and wondering whether they can keep this momentum up."

    "story": [
      "The speed of the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria is giving us a real-time insight into the dilemmas of foreign policy.",
      "The solid becoming fluid in the blink of an eye, and a whole array of awkward questions being posed.",
      "A dictator flees, his regime collapses and Foreign Secretary David Lammy addresses the Commons, telling MPs that Assad is a \"monster,\" a \"butcher\" a \"drug dealer\" and a \"rat\".",
      "But things are moving quickly.",
      "Asylum applications suspended",
      "When asked whether the UK would be suspending asylum applications from Syria, Lammy indicated that he didn't know.",
      "He didn't know that his cabinet colleague, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, was saying, at pretty much exactly that moment, that they were being suspended.",
      "In the year to September, the fifth largest number of asylum claims by nationality came from Syrians and nearly every claim - 99% - were granted.",
      "But the government is now pausing applications, alongside France, Germany and others.",
      "Why?",
      "The main reason is that the vast majority of people applying for asylum from Syria were doing so, they said, because they were fleeing the Assad regime.",
      "That regime has now gone and therefore so has, on the face of it, the central case being made in most applications.",
      "The other reason, described as much less significant in numerical terms but still a potential cause for concern on security grounds, is Syrians associated with the failed regime themselves now trying to claim asylum.",
      "Figures in government are now also contemplating the prospect that some Syrians in the UK may now want to return to their home country.",
      "What comes next in Syria?",
      "And what about what \u2013 and who \u2013 comes next in Syria?",

      "The British government labels them a proscribed terrorist organisation.",
      "The United States and the European Union attach their own labels which amount to broadly the same thing.",
      "Being proscribed means it is a criminal offence for people to promote, support or be a member of the organisation.",
      "And in practical terms it means the government can't have a conventional diplomatic relationship with it.",
      "That is one thing, when it is an organisation it doesn't want to have anything to do with, quite another if it ends up being the recognised government of a country.",
      "So how soon could HTS be de-proscribed?",
      "Cabinet Office Minister Pat McFadden, one of the most senior figures in the government, told the BBC there could be a \"relatively swift decision\" on whether to talk to HTS.",
      "But fast forward a few hours and both the foreign secretary and the prime minister were emphasising a much slower pace, saying \u2013 in line with the message from the White House \u2013 that HTS would be judged on its actions, with the implication this could take time and would not be rushed.",
      "Lammy said it was right to be \"cautious\".",
      "Sir Keir Starmer said \"no decision is pending at all.\"",

      "But in private, again and again, that sentiment comes from the mouths of this new government\u2019s most senior officials.",
      "No, they are not talking about Cummings\u2019s views on Brexit or Elon Musk. They are talking about \u2018Whitehall\u2019 - the shorthand by which the political class refers to the tangle of institutions and civil servants whose job it is to implement the government\u2019s agenda.",
      "In Whitehall, Cummings has long argued, \u201cfailure is normal\u201d while \u201cconfident public school bluffers\u201d - rather than people with real policy expertise - reign supreme.",
      "Generations of politicians have made similar critiques but rarely with such freewheeling intensity.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s speech on Thursday was primarily designed to offer more clarity for a sceptical public about the direction of his government, refining the five missions which he talked of in opposition.",
      "But the speech had a secondary aim: galvanising Whitehall, after he accused too many civil servants of being \"comfortable in the tepid bath of managed decline\".",
      "Union boss accuses Starmer of using Trumpian language",
      "Will the government be able to hit its new targets?",
      "How will Starmer's new-look Downing Street work?",
      "When they were in opposition, many Labour figures took the view that the Conservatives had hobbled their own government through a needlessly antagonistic relationship with the civil service.",
      "Few talk that way now. \u201cThe biggest disappointment of going into government has been the quality of the civil service,\u201d one leading government adviser said.",
      "Another added: \u201cThe Cummings analysis is where we are in lots of ways.\"",
      "One senior government source said: \u201cDominic Cummings was right about Whitehall. But I blame him and the Conservative Party for 14 years of low pay, bad leadership and demoralisation which means we don\u2019t have the right people in the right places.\u201d",
      "Wherever the blame is ascribed for Whitehall\u2019s deficiencies, the frustration is beginning to spill into public view.",
      "Peter Hyman, the Labour adviser who came up with Sir Keir's \u2018missions\u2019 but did not follow him into government, wrote in the New Statesman last week that there were \u201cbarriers within the state\u201d to delivering Starmer\u2019s agenda.",
      "He said it was \u201castonishing\u201d how many senior civil servants still relied on \u201cclunky cabinet committees\u201d and old-fashioned processes.",
      "For some of the PM\u2019s top team the flaws in the British state are built into its very fabric.",
      "\u201c10 Downing Street is a ridiculous place to run a major economy,\u201d one government adviser said.",
      "\u201cYou go from a modern open plan office in opposition to Downing Street where you\u2019re all scattered around like kids in a big house who\u2019ve gone off to separate bedrooms to do their homework.\u201d",
      "Yet vague aspirations to move the prime minister and his team into the Cabinet Office next door and turn Downing Street into state rooms to entertain dignitaries \u2014 yes, also previously discussed by Cummings  - are likely to remain just that.",
      "\u201cCan you imagine how long it would take the civil service to make that happen?\u201d an official sighed.",
      "Plenty would think this unfair on the civil service, which has often found itself a scapegoat for failings of politicians but cannot publicly answer back.",
      "After all, Labour figures acknowledge they were nowhere near as ready for government as they needed to be. That was in part the reason for the rapid departure of Sue Gray, Sir Keir\u2019s initial chief of staff, after just three months in post.",
      "Certainly even among those civil servants who are alive to Whitehall\u2019s systemic flaws there is a view that the prime minister himself needs to be much more active in driving the machine if he wants to achieve results.",
      "\u201cStarmer appears to confuse process with outcomes,\u201d one said.",
      "\u201cYou can set up a child poverty taskforce, OK. But what do you want to do about the two-child benefit cap? You still have to make political choices and officials can\u2019t do that for you.\u201d",
      "As well as setting up a child poverty taskforce, Sir Keir has formed a series of \u2018mission boards\u2019 designed to drive through his agenda in each of those five core areas.",
      "Each is chaired by the relevant minister - for example, the health mission board is chaired by Wes Streeting, the health secretary.",
      "Alex Thomas, a former senior civil servant who is now at the Institute for Government think tank, suggested that Sir Keir himself would be a better chair for those boards if he wants \u201caction and dynamism across the system.\u201d",
      "Thomas said: \u201cThe British system of government responds to ministerial and particularly prime ministerial involvement and leadership \u2026 If you leave it to the civil service, however much talent there is, it will end up missing the mark because it lacks that political direction and that authority.\u201d",
      "Those around Starmer acknowledge that the mission boards are not yet quite at full strength. They will soon become more public-facing entities, holding meetings outside of London and doing more to bring in expertise from outside government.",
      "Stocktaking",
      "But the principal way in which the prime minister will seek to drive his agenda is via \u201cstock takes\u201d. These are meetings where Sir Keir brings those responsible for each mission into Downing Street to hold them accountable for what the data is showing in their area and asking them how they propose to improve. It\u2019s an idea which was pioneered by Sir Tony Blair on the advice of Michael Barber, his delivery adviser, who recently returned to government.",
      "The frequency of these stocktakes will soon increase, a senior government source said, adding: \u201cIf we are saying that this is the mission of the government and this is how people should judge its success and failure then it is clearly something you need the PM driving through.\u201d",
      "In the next few weeks Pat McFadden, the cabinet minister helping the prime minister to coordinate policy across Whitehall, will give a speech with more detail on the government\u2019s plans for civil service reform.",
      "Both he and Sir Keir are said to be seized of the need to bring more outside expertise into government and to make better use of data and artificial intelligence.",
      "The government\u2019s stated aims here are bold. Announcing the appointment of Sir Chris Wormald this week as the new cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, Sir Keir charged him with \u201cnothing less than the complete re-wiring of the British state\u201d.",
      "There was no shortage of people in Whitehall questioning whether the longest-serving head of a government department  - Sir Chris has run the health department for eight years and education for four before that  - is the right person to transform Whitehall. Sir Chris's supporters say that within the current system he is one of those most open to reform.",
      "The appointment was received with open contempt by Cummings, who sarcastically described it as a \u201ctruly beautiful, artistic\u201d decision which should serve as a \u201cwake up call\u201d that \u201cthe Westminster system is totally determined to resist any change\u201d.",
      "And on that, at the very least, the success of this government depends on Dominic Cummings being wrong."

      "When Dr Mowla came across the galaxy, she had never seen clumps of stars in such vivid and varying colours. It led her to believe that there was something different about this system, so she checked how far away it was.",
      "To her surprise it turned out to be more than 13 billion light years away.",
      "The light from Firefly Sparkle is from not long after the creation of the Universe and so has taken more than 13 billion years to reach us. It is so small and so far away that not even JWST would have been able to see it, were it not for an extremely lucky cosmic coincidence.",
      "There was a cluster of galaxies exactly between Firefly Sparkle and the JWST, which distorted spacetime to stretch the light from the faraway galaxy and effectively act as a gigantic magnifying glass.",
      "Astronomers call this process gravitational lensing, which in this instance enabled the research co-lead Dr Kartheik Iyer of Columbia University in New York, and other members of the team, to see for the first time, incredible details of how the first galaxies like our own Milky Way formed.",
      "\u201cIt takes the light coming from the firefly and bends it and amplifies it so we can see it in glorious detail,\u201d he told BBC News.",
      "\"Our reconstruction shows that clumps of actively forming stars are surrounded by diffuse light from other stars. This galaxy is literally in the process of assembling.\"",

      "The long-awaited decision sets out a successor to a world-first law that Australia passed in 2021, which was designed to make giants like Meta and Google pay for hosting news on their platforms.",
      "Earlier this year Meta - which owns Facebook and Instagram - announced it would not renew payment deals it had in place with Australian news organisations, setting up a standoff with lawmakers.",

      "The new taxation model begins in January 2025 and will be cemented into law once parliament returns in February.",

      "They harness quantum mechanics - the strange behaviour of ultra-tiny particles - to crack problems far faster than traditional computers.",
      "It's hoped quantum computers might eventually be able to use that ability to vastly speed up complex processes, such as creating new medicines.",
      "There are also fears it could be used for ill -  for example to break some types of encryption used to protect sensitive data.",
      "In February Apple announced that the encryption that protects iMessage chats is being made \"quantum proof\" to stop them being read by powerful future quantum computers.",
      "Hartmut Neven leads Google's Quantum AI lab that created Willow and describes himself as the project's \"chief optimist.\"",
      "He told the BBC that Willow would be used in some practical applications - but declined, for now, to provide more detail.",
      "But a chip able to perform commercial applications would not appear before the end of the decade, he said.",
      "Initially these applications would be the simulation of systems where quantum effects are important",
      "\"For example, relevant when it comes to the design of nuclear fusion reactors to understand the functioning of drugs and pharmaceutical development, it would be relevant for developing better car batteries and another long list of such tasks\".",
      "What is quantum computing?",
      "Apples and oranges",
      "Mr Neven told the BBC Willow's performance meant it was the \"best quantum processor built to date\".",
      "But Professor Alan Woodward, a computing expert at Surrey University, says quantum computers will be better at a range of tasks than current \"classical\" computers, but they will not replace them.",
      "He warns against overstating the importance of Willow's achievement in a single test.",
      "\"One has to be careful not to compare apples and oranges\" he told the BBC.",
      "Google had chosen a problem to use as a benchmark of performance that was, \"tailor-made for a quantum computer\" and this didn't demonstrate \"a universal speeding up when compared to classical computers\".",
      "Nonetheless, he said Willow represented significant progress, in particular in what's known as error correction.",
      "In very simple terms the more useful a quantum computer is, the more qubits it has.",
      "However a major problem with the technology is that it is prone to errors - a tendency that has previously increased the more qubits a chip has.",
      "But Google researchers say they have reversed this and managed to engineer and program the new chip so the error rate fell across the whole system as the number of qubits increased.",
      "It was a major \"breakthrough\" that cracked a key challenge that the field had pursued \"for almost 30 years\", Mr Neven believes.",
      "He told the BBC it was comparable to \"if you had an airplane with just one engine -  that will work, but two engines are safer, four engines is yet safer\".",
      "Errors are a significant obstacle in creating more powerful quantum computers and the development was \"encouraging for everyone striving to build a practical quantum computer\" Prof Woodward said.",
      "But Google itself notes that to develop practically useful quantum computers the error rate will still need to go much lower than that displayed by Willow.",
      "Willow was made in Google's new, purpose-built manufacturing plant in California.",
      "Countries around the world are investing in quantum computing.",
      "The UK recently launched the National Quantum Computing Centre (NQCC).",
      "Its director, Michael Cuthbert, told the BBC he was wary of language that fuelled the \"hype cycle\" and thought Willow was more a \"milestone rather than a breakthrough\".",
      "Nevertheless, it was \"clearly a highly impressive piece of work\".",
      "Eventually quantum computers would help with a range of tasks including \"logistics problems such as cargo freight distribution on aircraft or routing of telecoms signals or stored energy throughout the national grid\", he said.",
      "And there were already 50 quantum businesses in the UK, attracting \u00a3800m in funding and employing 1300 people.",
      "On Friday, researchers from Oxford University and Osaka University in Japan published a paper showcasing the very low error rate in a trapped-ion qubit.",
      "Theirs is a different approach to making a quantum computer that's capable of working at room temperature - whereas Google's chip has to be stored at ultra low temperatures to be effective.",
      "Scientific findings from Google's development of Willow have been published in the journal Nature",

      "The deadline would see TikTok effectively banned in the US from 19 January 2025.",
      "In Monday's request for an emergency injunction, TikTok's lawyers argued the law would \"inflict extreme and irreparable harm\" on the company - adding it would do so \"on the eve of a presidential inauguration\".",
      "President-elect Donald Trump will take office as the country's 47th president on 20 January.",
      "He has previously claimed he would \"save TikTok\" from a ban.",
      "Ahead of the run-up to the November election, Trump said the law would benefit Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.",
      "But experts have warned that while his promises may offer a lifeline for the company's US future, they are no guarantee of the action he will take once in office.",
      "DOJ officials said in their letter also filed on Monday that the appeals court should reject the injunction request.",

    "summary": "Queensland's new laws will see children found guilty of serious crimes given harsher penalties.",
    "story": [
      "The Australian state of Queensland has passed laws which will see children as young as 10 subject to the same penalties as adults if convicted of crimes such as murder, serious assault and break-ins.",
      "The government says the harsher sentencing rules are in response to \"community outrage over crimes being perpetrated by young offenders\" and will act as a deterrent.",
      "But many experts have pointed to research showing that tougher penalties do not reduce youth offending, and can in fact exacerbate it.",
      "The United Nations has also criticised the reforms, arguing they disregard conventions on the human rights of children and violate international law.",
      "The Liberal National Party (LNP) - which won the state election in October - made the rules a hallmark of its campaign, saying they put the \"rights of victims\" ahead of \"the rights of criminals\".",
      "\"These laws are for every Queenslander who has ever felt unsafe and been a victim of youth crime across our state,\" Premier David Crisafulli said after parliament passed the bill on Thursday.",
      "Leading up to the vote, both sides of politics had claimed that Queensland was in the grips of a youth crime wave, and that a more punitive approach was necessary to combat the issue.",
      "But data from the Australian bureau of statistics, shows that youth crime has halved in Queensland across the past 14 years, that it hit its lowest rate in recorded history in 2022, and has remained relatively steady since.",
      "Figures from the Queensland Police Service and the Australian Institute of Criminology also demonstrate a clear downward trend.",
      "Dubbed by the government as \"adult crime, adult time\", the new laws list 13 offences which will now be subject to harsher prison sentences when committed by youths, including mandatory life detention for murder, with a non-parole period of 20 years.",
      "Previously, the maximum penalty for young offenders convicted of murder was 10 years in jail, with life imprisonment only considered if the crime was \"particularly heinous\".",
      "The laws also remove \"detention as a last resort\" provisions - which favour non-custodial orders, such as fines or community service, for children rather than incarceration - and will make it possible for judges to consider a child's full criminal history when sentencing.",
      "The Queensland Police Union has called the changes  \"a leap forward in the right direction\", while Queensland's new Attorney-General Deb Frecklington says it will give courts the ability to \"better address patterns of offending\" and \"hold people accountable for their actions\".",
      "But in a summary, Frecklington also noted the changes were in direct conflict with international standards, that Indigenous children would be disproportionately impacted and that more youngsters were likely to be held in police cells for extended periods because detention centres are full.",
      "Queensland already has more children in detention than any other Australian state or territory.",
      "Premier Crisafulli said on Thursday that although there may be \"pressure in the short-term\" his government had a long-term plan to \"deliver a raft of other detention facilities and different options\".",
      "Australia's commissioner for children, Anne Hollonds, described the changes as an \"international embarrassment\".",
      "She also accused Queensland's government of \"ignoring evidence\" which suggests \"the younger a child comes into contact with the justice system, the more likely it is that they will continue to commit more serious crimes\".",
      "\"The fact that [the bill's] provisions are targeting our most at-risk children makes this retreat from human rights even more shocking,\" she said in a statement on Wednesday.",
      "Other legal experts, who gave evidence to a parliamentary hearing on the bill last week, said the laws could have unintended consequences for victims, with children being less likely to plead guilty given the tougher sentences, resulting in more trials and longer court delays.",

      "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says its air force and navy have conducted more than 350 strikes since Saturday night, taking out an estimated 70-80% of Syrian strategic military assets from Damascus to Latakia.",

    "story": [
      "Russian naval vessels appear to have temporarily left their main port in Syria, satellite images reviewed by BBC Verify show, amid continuing uncertainty about Moscow's military future in the country after the fall of its ally, Bashar al-Assad.",
      "Images taken by Maxar on 10 December show some ships have left Tartous naval base since Sunday and are currently sitting offshore in the Mediterranean Sea.",
      "Meanwhile, other photos taken on the same day show activity continuing at Russia's main airbase in Syria, Hmeimim, with jets clearly visible on the tarmac.",
      "On Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow would enter talks with incoming authorities about Russia's future military presence.",
      "\"Everything possible is now being done to get in touch with those involved in ensuring security and, of course, our military is also taking all the necessary precautions,\" he told reporters in Moscow.",
      "He previously warned that it was \"premature\" to speculate on the bases' future.",
      "\"You know that, of course, we maintain contacts with those who control the situation in Syria now. This is necessary because we have our bases there and our diplomatic office [embassy]. And of course, ensuring the safety and security of our facilities are of utmost importance,\" he told reporters.",
      "The Tartous naval facility houses elements of the Black Sea Fleet and is Russia's only repair and replenishment hub in the Mediterranean. Established by the Soviet Union in the 1970s, it was expanded and modernised by Russia in 2012 as the Kremlin began to increase its support for President Assad's regime.",
      "It allows Russian vessels to remain in the Mediterranean without having to return to ports in the Black Sea via the Turkish Straits. It is also a deep-water port, meaning it can host submarines from Moscow's nuclear fleet, according to the US Naval Institute.",
      "The new satellite images show Moscow has at least temporarily brought its ships out of the port, with two guided missile frigates moored about 13km (eight miles) off the Syrian coast. It is unclear where the remainder of the fleet - pictured in earlier images - currently is.",
      "It is also unclear whether their departure is part of a permanent withdrawal from Tartous. In recent weeks, satellite images have repeatedly shown naval vessels coming and going from the port.",
      "Mike Plunkett from the open-source defence intelligence analysts at Janes organisation noted that the Russian movements appeared to have been \"conducted to ensure that their ships are not vulnerable to attack\".",
      "\"Whether they are worried about attack from the Syrian rebels or collateral damage from any Israeli strike on Syrian assets in Tartus is unknown,\" he added.",
      "Frederik Van Lokeren, a former Belgian navy lieutenant and analyst, told BBC Verify that it appeared the Russian vessels were now in a holding pattern while Moscow deliberated on its next move.",
      "\"They're effectively in limbo at the moment, because they don't quite know what's going to happen,\" Mr Van Lokeren said.",
      "\"Obviously, since they're lingering there, it seems that Russia is not willing to withdraw all its naval vessels out of the area just yet, which might be an indication that they're negotiating with regional partners to see where they can redeploy these vessels.\"",
      "Analysts have speculated that if Russia is forced to close the Tartous naval facility, it could redeploy its presence to Tobruk in Libya. The region is controlled by the Kremlin-backed Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar and already hosts some Russian airbases.",
      "But withdrawing from Tartous would be immensely costly, and Mr Van Lokeren noted that the move would also bring Russian vessels closer to Nato bases, making them easier to track. For now, he said, there is no indication that Russia is moving the necessary naval assets to remove equipment from Tartous.",

      "Satellite images reviewed by BBC Verify showed at least two large jets - identified by Janes as IL-76 transport aircraft - still sitting on the tarmac at the base on 10 December. Helicopters could also be seen at the base in the images.",
      "Janes also notes that air defence systems deployed at the site remain visible in the north-western corner of the image.",
      "Dara Massicot, an analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said on X on Sunday that an evacuation of the airbase would involve a massive airlift requiring far more jets than those visible in the satellite images, suggesting that Moscow does not plan to evacuate imminently.",
      "\"When Russian forces deployed to Syria in 2015, they flew almost 300 sorties in two weeks, and that was before base expansion,\" she wrote on X.",
      "\"A change signifying a major evacuation will be clear,\" she added.",
      "Despite the current holding pattern Russian forces appear to be displaying, the fall of the Assad regime represents a major blow to the Kremlin's ambitions in the region. During a 2017 visit to Khmeimim air base, President Vladimir Putin made clear that he intended for Moscow's presence to be a long-term project.",

    "summary": "For the first time, the annual report delved into race and ethnic data of those who underwent assisted dying.",
    "story": [
      "The rate of medical assistance in dying - also known as euthanasia - has grown in Canada for the fifth straight year, albeit at a slower pace.",
      "The country released its fifth annual report since legalising assisted dying in 2016, which for the first time included data on the ethnicity of those seeking euthanasia.",
      "Around 15,300 people underwent assisted dying last year, accounting for 4.7% of deaths in the country. Canada lawmakers are currently seeking to expand access to euthanasia to cover people with mental illnesses by 2027.",
      "Canada is among a few countries that have introduced assisted dying laws in the past decade. Others include Australia, New Zealand, Spain, Austria.",
      "The figures released on Wednesday by Health Canada show that the rate of assisted dying in Canada increased by nearly 16% in 2023. This number is a sharp drop from the average increase of 31% in previous years.",
      "The report cautioned that it is too early to determine what caused the rate to slacken.",
      "Nearly all of those who requested assisted dying - around 96% - had a foreseeable natural death. The remaining 4% were granted euthanasia due to having a long-term chronic illness and where a natural death was not imminent.",
      "The average age of those seeking assisted dying was around 77 years old, with cancer being the most frequent underlying medical condition.",
      "For the first time, the report delved into race and ethnic data of those who died by euthanasia.",
      "Around 96% of recipients identified as white people, who account for about 70% of Canada's population. It is unclear what caused this disparity.",
      "The second most reported ethnic group was east Asians (1.8%), who account for about 5.7% of Canadians.",
      "Assisted dying continued to have the highest usage rate in Quebec, which accounted for nearly 37% of all euthanasia deaths, despite the province holding just 22% of Canada's population.",
      "Quebec's government launched a study earlier this year to examine why its euthanasia rate was so high.",
      "While the number of assisted deaths in Canada is growing, the country still falls behind the Netherlands, where euthanasia accounted for around 5% of total deaths last year.",
      "UK MPs voted late last month to pass a similar bill that gives terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to have an assisted death, though it will face months of further scrutiny before it could become law.",
      "As British MPs debated the legislation, Canada was cited by some as a cautionary tale due to its perceived lack of safeguards.",
      "Like the UK, Canada initially only legalised assisted dying for those whose death was \"reasonably foreseeable\".",
      "However, Canada expanded access in 2021 to people who may not have a terminal diagnosis, but want to end their life because of a chronic, debilitating condition.",
      "It was set to broaden access once again to people with mental illnesses earlier this year.",
      "But that was delayed for the second time after concerns were raised by Canadian provinces, which oversee healthcare delivery, about whether the system could cope with such an expansion.",
      "On Wednesday, Health Canada defended the procedure, saying that the criminal code sets out \"strict eligibility\" criteria.",
      "But Cardus, a Christian think tank, said the latest figures were \"alarming\" and showed Canada has one of the fastest growing euthanasia programmes in the world.",
      "A report released in October by Ontario - Canada's most populous province - has since shed some light on controversial cases where people were granted assisted dying when they were not nearing their natural death.",
      "One example included a woman in her 50s with a history of depression and suicidal thoughts who had a severe sensitivity to chemicals.",
      "Her request for euthanasia was granted after she failed to secure housing that could have met her medical needs.",
      "Another case made headlines in recent months of a Nova Scotia cancer patient who said she was asked if she was aware of assisted dying as an option twice as she underwent mastectomy surgeries.",
      "The question \"came up in completely inappropriate places\", she told the National Post.",

      "Prosecutors have been able to go into this level of detail because, unusually for a rape trial, there is a staggering amount of evidence, as the alleged assaults were filmed over almost a decade by Dominique Pelicot.",
      "He has admitted all the charges against him and has told the court all 50 of his co-accused are guilty too.",
      "All the video evidence means none of the men have been able to deny they ever went to the Pelicots' home. But the majority vehemently contest the charges of aggravated rape that would incur hefty sentences.",

      "Having learned how to drug his wife in order to abuse her, he did so for five years and admits it.",
      "He blames his crimes on meeting Dominique Pelicot, who he says was \"reassuring, like a cousin\". Prosecutors are seeking a 17-year jail term.",
      "'Manipulated and tricked by Pelicot'",

      "Redouane A, an unemployed man aged 40, argued that if he had set out to rape Gis\u00e8le he would not have allowed her husband to take videos.",
      "Some also say they were intimidated by Dominique Pelicot, who one lawyer told the BBC, was an \"abominable character\".",
      "In tears, male nurse Redouan E told the courtroom he was too scared of him to leave the bedroom. \"Maybe you can't tell from the videos, but I was really terrified!\" he told judges.",
      "Others maintain they were offered drinks that were spiked with drugs and therefore cannot remember the encounter, although Dominique Pelicot has denied ever doing this.",
      "The majority, however, maintain they were manipulated or tricked by Dominique Pelicot, who convinced them they were taking part in a sex game with a consensual couple.",
      "\"They were put in a situation where they were scammed,\" Christophe Bruschi, Joseph C's lawyer, told the BBC. \"They were taken for a ride.\"",
      "But Dominique Pelicot has always said he made it abundantly clear to the men that his wife was not aware of the plot.",

      "Since September, the 50 men have appeared, one after the other, in front of the court in Avignon.",
      "Usually in rape cases character investigations can take several days.",
      "In this trial, because of the sheer number of defendants involved, they have been condensed into a few hours at most. Their lives have been dissected at record speed, often turning the court session into a litany of stories of abuse and trauma.",
      "Simon\u00e9 M, a 43-year-old construction worker, said he was raped when he was 11 by a family friend who employed him to look after cattle in the French overseas territory of New Caledonia.",
      "Father-of-four Jean-Luc L, 46, told the court how he and his family had left Vietnam on a dinghy when he was a child and lived in a refugee camp in Thailand for several years before moving to France.",
      "Fabien S, a 39-year-old man with several previous convictions including drug dealing and sexual assault of a minor, was abused and beaten by foster parents from a very young age. Like several others, he said he only realised during psychiatrist appointments ordered by the court that his hazy, painful childhood memories actually constituted rape.",
      "Many wives, partners and family members of the defendants were called up to give character statements. They, too, scrambled for answers as they sought to understand how the men in their lives could have ended up \"caught up in this kind of situation\", as one woman put it.",
      "\"I was shocked, it doesn't sound like him at all. He was the joy of my life,\" said the elderly father of Christian L.",
      "The firefighter is also being investigated for possessing child abuse imagery, as are four others, and faces 16 years in jail. \"Something must have happened, he must have become depressed,\" his father wondered aloud.",

      "\"When they told me what he was accused of I said: 'never, that's impossible... I don't understand what he's doing here at all.'\"  She believed it was the death of their 18-year-old son that had led her ex-husband to fall into a deep depression, start drinking and eventually make contact with Dominique Pelicot.",
      "\"I will always be there for him, whatever happens,\" said the ex-girlfriend of Guyana-born Joan K. At 27, he is the youngest of the defendants and a former soldier in the French army.",
      "He has denied raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot on two occasions. While he knew she would be unconscious, he said he had not realised she had not given her consent.",
      "In floods of tears, a woman called Samira said she has spent the last three and a half years \"looking for answers\" as to why J\u00e9r\u00f4me V had gone to the Pelicots' six times.",

      "He is one of the few who have admitted to raping Gis\u00e8le, saying he liked the idea of having \"free rein\" over her \u2013 but blamed it however on his \"uncontrollable sexuality\".",
      "Gis\u00e8le Pelicot: They raped me in full conscience",
      "Many former and current partners of the defendants have undergone tests to see if they too had been drugged like Gis\u00e8le. One woman said she would \"always have a terrible doubt\" that the \"respectful, thoughtful, sweet man\" she knew had abused her too without her knowledge.",
      "Since the start of the trial, much has been made of the need to find an element that ties all these men together.",

      "The photograph below shows the same whale photographed in 2022, off the Zanzibar coast.",
      "Dr Kalashnikova said it was very likely the longest distance a humpback whale had ever been recorded travelling.",
      "Humpback whales live in all oceans around the world. They travel long distances every year and have one of the longest migrations of any mammal, swimming from tropical breeding grounds to feeding grounds in cooler waters.",
      "But this male's journey was even more spectacular, involving two distant breeding grounds.",

      "The wandering male was among a group of humpbacks photographed from a research vessel on the Pacific coast of Colombia in 2013.",
      "He was then identified in a similar area in 2017 - and off Zanzibar in 2022.",

      "Jones later acknowledged that the killings were real and insisted his statements were covered by US free speech protections.",
      "But relatives of the victims won defamation judgements against Jones and his company over his false statements.",
      "He declared bankruptcy in 2022 as the Sandy Hook case made its way to court, and in June 2024, a judge ordered the liquidation of Jones's personal assets.

      "In exchange, PNG signed a separate pact which it says reaffirms its commitment to Australia as its major security partner.",
      "The precise terms of the dual deals are confidential, but the BBC understands they allow Australia to withdraw funding if PNG enters a security agreement with a nation outside the so-called \"Pacific family\". That term is widely accepted to exclude China, despite Beijing's efforts to gain a foothold in the region.",
      "If Canberra pulls out, the NRL is then obligated to drop the PNG team.",

      "\"For us, it's not just sport and sport commerce, it is [about]... uniting the most diverse nation on the face of planet Earth and also uniting PNG-Australia together in ways that matter most, people to people,\" he told reporters.",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese declared it was a \"great day\" for both countries, and said PNG - the only country in the world where rugby league is the national sport - \"deserves\" a spot in the league.",

      "'Unprecedented' win for sport diplomacy",
      "Stuart Murray, an Associate Professor of International Relations, told the BBC that while Australia's use of sport as a diplomatic strategy is nothing new, this agreement is unprecedented.",

      "Both prime ministers have sought to downplay the security aspect of the deals, framing them instead as a boon to what Mr Nobetau says has been a \"thinning\" relationship between the two countries.",
      "Marape made a point to say the agreement \"doesn't stop us from relating with any nation, especially our Asian neighbours\".",
      "\"We relate with China, for instance, a great trading partner, a great bilateral partner,\" he said. \"But in security, closer to home\u2026 our shared territory needs to be protected, defended, policed\u2026 together.\"",
      "Government sources say the deals do not give Australia veto power over PNG security agreements. But their framing does have the effect of eliminating almost every other potential partner - and Mr Nobetau said the announcement could be seen by some in PNG as \"an exertion of Australian power over PNG sovereignty\".",
      "Both he and Dr Murray also note, however, that the dual deals speak to an emerging \"transactional\" dynamic in Pacific relations.",
      "\"People that talk about goodwill and who say sport and politics don't mix, that's the 20th century view,\" Dr Murray said. \"For us, there's no way we're going to give away one of our prize cultural assets for nothing. That doesn't happen in diplomacy.\"",
      "Dr Murray and Mr Nobetau also both agree that the deals mark a significant moment in bilateral relations between the two countries - and are a likely indicator of how Australia is going to continue to pursue its agenda across the region.",
      "\"China puts in a lot of money into sport infrastructure\u2026 which is sort of what China is good at\u2026 [but] China is not going to be offering any alternatives in this space,\" Mr Nobetau said.",

      "Mahama will be flanked by former Education Minister Naana Jane Opoku-Agyemang, who is set to become Ghana's first female vice-president when the new government takes office next month.",
      "Dr Yakubu said her appointment was not one of \"tokenism\" and she was not someone who could be \"manipulated\".",
      "\"We have a fantastic first female vice-president in Prof Naana Jane Opoku-Agyemang,\" she told the BBC Focus on Africa podcast.",
      "Mahama served his first four-year term as president after winning in 2012, but lost his re-election bid in 2016 as Nana Akufo-Addo rose to power with Bawumia as his running-mate.",
      "Dr Yakubu said Mahama contested the 2016 election on his track record in building roads, schools and hospitals but voters rejected him, as their mantra then was: \"We don't eat infrastructure.\"",
      "But, she said, during the Covid pandemic voters came to appreciate the infrastructure his government had built, especially hospitals.",
      "This - along with the fact that the economy had plunged into a deep crisis under the current government, forcing it to seek a $3bn (\u00a32.4bn) bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) - led to Mahama being re-elected, Dr Yakubu added.",
      "She told the BBC that Mahama would now be expected to fulfil his campaign promise to create jobs in order to bring down the unemployment rate of almost 15%, and to ease the cost-of-living crisis by scrapping some taxes - or what Ghanaians call \"nuisance taxes\".",
      "Mahama has promised to make Ghana a \"24-hour economy\" through the creation of night-time jobs in both the public and private sectors. He said he would give businesses tax incentives to stay open at night and reduce electricity prices for them.",
      "But his critics have doubts, pointing out that Ghana plunged into its worst electricity crisis during his first term and the power cuts were so bad that Mahama joked at the time that he was known as \"Mr Dumsor\" - \"dum\" means \"off\" and \"sor\" means \"on\" in the local Twi language.",
      "He has pledged to abolish several taxes - including the much-criticised electronic levy on mobile transactions and the one on the carbon emissions produced by petrol or diesel-powered vehicles.",
      "Prof Bokpin said he doubted the Mahama administration would be able to fulfil its promises.",
      "\"They have not done the cost-benefit analysis. There's no budgetary space to translate those promises into actuals,\" he said.",
      "But Mahama is confident he will prove his critics wrong, saying he intends to renegotiate the conditions of the IMF loan so money is freed up for \"social intervention programmes\" in a country where 7.3 million people live in poverty.",
      "In an interview ahead of the election, Mahama told the BBC the IMF wanted \"a certain balance\" in government finances.",
      "\"If you're able to cut expenditure, and you're able to increase revenue and increase non-tax revenue coming in, you'll be able to create a balance,\" he said.",
      "Dr Asah-Asante said Mahama's experience as former president would stand him in good stead to navigate Ghana through choppy waters.",
      "\"Of course, he is likely to encounter difficulties, but he has what it takes to turn things around,\" the analyst added.",
      "Apart from the economy, corruption is one of the biggest issues facing Ghana but not everyone is convinced that Mahama will be able to tackle the scourge.",
      "Mahama's previous stint in government - as vice-president and president - was plagued by corruption allegations, although he has consistently denied any wrongdoing.",
      "In 2020, a UK court had found that aviation giant Airbus had used bribes to secure contracts with Ghana for military planes between 2009 and 2015.",
      "An investigation was then started in Ghana, but the Office of the Special Prosecutor, in a decision announced just months before the election, concluded there was no evidence that Mahama was involved in any corrupt activities himself.",
      "The outgoing government has also been dogged by corruption allegations, including over the purchase of ambulance spare parts at a cost of $34.9m and a  controversial national cathedral project in which $58m has been spent without any progress in building it.",
      "Mahama promised his government would tackle corruption, and ensure that officials were prosecuted for wrongdoing.",
      "\"We are thinking about special courts,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Dr Asah-Asante said Mahama should demand financial accountability from the outgoing government during a handover phase so that \"whatever has gone wrong,  he will be able to right\" as soon as his government takes office next month.",
      "The analyst added that Mahama, who will be inaugurated next month when President Akufo-Addo steps down after his two terms in office, had no choice but to meet the expectations of Ghanaians - or else they would \"punish his government the way they have punished the NPP\".",
      "Mahama succinctly acknowledged this in his victory speech, saying: \"Expectations of Ghanaians are very high, and we cannot afford to disappoint them.",
      "\"Our best days are not behind us; our best days are ahead of us. Forward ever - backwards never.\"",

      "Bashar al-Assad became president after the death in 2000 of his father Hafez, who had ruled for almost three decades.",
      "In 2011, he brutally crushed a peaceful, pro-democracy uprising, sparking a devastating civil war in which more than half a million people have been killed and 12 million others have been forced to flee their homes.",
      "Thirteen days ago, the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and allied rebel factions launched a major offensive in north-western Syria.",
      "The rebels quickly captured the country's second-largest city, Aleppo, then swept southwards down the highway to the capital, Damascus, as the military collapsed.",
      "Russia announced that Assad had stepped down and left Syria on Sunday, hours after the rebels entered Damascus and crowds gathered on the streets to celebrate. It later emerged that Assad had flown to Moscow and been granted asylum.",
      "HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani meanwhile arrived in Damascus and told Syrians: \"The future is ours.\"",
      "How did the takeover unfold?",
      "For the past four years, it had felt like the civil war was effectively over.",
      "Assad's government had regained control over most of Syria's cities with the help of Russia, Iran and Iranian-backed militias like Hezbollah, and the front lines were largely frozen.",
      "However, large parts of the country were still out of the government's control.",
      "The rebels' last stronghold was in Aleppo and Idlib provinces, which border Turkey and where more than four million people were living, many of them displaced. It was dominated by HTS, but a number of allied rebel groups and jihadist groups were also based there. Turkish-backed rebel factions also controlled territory with the support of Turkish troops.",
      "On 27 November, HTS and its allies launched their surprise offensive.",
      "After three days, they took control of most of Aleppo - Syria's second-largest city. They said they faced little resistance on the ground after the government rapidly withdrew its troops and security forces.",

      "The Turkish-backed rebel factions meanwhile capitalised on the government's retreat by launching a separate offensive on territory north of Aleppo controlled by a Kurdish-led militia alliance supported by the United States, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).",
      "Assad vowed to \"crush\" the rebels with the help of his allies. Russian warplanes intensified strikes on rebel-held areas and Iran-backed militias sent reinforcements to help the military near Hama - the next city south on the way to Damascus.",
      "But Hama fell to the rebels on Thursday, after several days of fierce battles that eventually prompted the military to withdraw.",
      "The rebels declared their next goal was to take Homs, Syria's third-largest city, and achieved that on Saturday night after only a day of fighting. At the same time, other rebel factions reached the suburbs of Damascus.",
      "Early on Sunday, HTS-led rebels announced they had entered Damascus and released detainees at the country's most notorious military prison, Saydnaya.",
      "Less than two hours later, they declared: \"The tyrant Bashar al-Assad has fled.\"",
      "The rebels also promised to build a \"homeland for all, including all sects and social classes\".",

      "What is Hayat Tahrir al-Sham?",
      "The Islamist militant group that led the offensive against Assad was set up in 2012 under a different name, al-Nusra Front.",
      "Al-Nusra Front, which pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda the following year, was regarded as one of the most effective and deadly groups fighting President Assad.",
      "But it was feared for its jihadist ideology, and was seen as being at odds with the largely secular main rebel coalition - the Free Syrian Army.",
      "In 2016, Al-Nusra broke ties with al-Qaeda and took the name Hayat Tahrir al-Sham when it merged with other factions a year later.",
      "However, the UN, US, UK and a number of other countries continue to consider HTS as an al-Qaeda affiliate and frequently refer to it as al-Nusra Front. The US named Abu Mohammed al-Jolani as a specially designated global terrorist and offered a $10m reward for information that led to his capture.",
      "HTS consolidated its power in Idlib and Aleppo provinces by crushing its rivals, including al-Qaeda and Islamic State (IS) group cells. It set up the so-called Syrian Salvation Government to administer the territory according to Islamic law.",
      "Why did the rebels succeed?",
      "For several years, Idlib remained a battleground as Syrian government forces tried to regain control.",
      "But in 2020, Turkey and Russia brokered a ceasefire to halt a push by the government to retake Idlib. The ceasefire largely held despite sporadic fighting.",
      "HTS and its allies said on 27 November that they had launched an offensive to \"deter aggression\", accusing the government and allied Iran-backed militias of escalating attacks on civilians.",
      "But it came at a time when the government had been weakened by years of war, sanctions and corruption - with allies Russia and Iran preoccupied by other conflicts.",
      "The Iran-backed group Hezbollah had recently suffered from Israel's offensive in Lebanon. Israeli strikes had eliminated Iranian military commanders in Syria, and Russia was distracted by the war in Ukraine.",

      "Outgoing prime minister Mohammed al-Jalili said on Monday that most members of his former cabinet were working with the rebels \"so that the transitional period is quick and smooth\".",
      "The rebels said in a brief statement that their forces were close to establishing complete control of Damascus and preserving public property. They also said Syria's new government would begin its work as soon as it was formed.",
      "The National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, which represents now-former opposition groups, said on Sunday that it was committed to \"completing the transfer of power to a transitional governing body with full executive powers, paving the way for a free, democratic and pluralistic Syria\".",
      "The statement made no mention of HTS, but its vice-president, Dima Moussa, told the BBC that the \"transition requires coming together of all Syrian people, including those who are carrying arms\".",
      "Meanwhile, the war continued in other parts of Syria.",
      "HTS and its allies said their forces were advancing in the western countryside of Deir al-Zour, the largest city in eastern Syria.",
      "Turkish-backed rebel factions fighting under the banner of the Syrian National Army were also advancing north-west of Aleppo into territory held by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.",
      "Israel confirmed it was attacking suspected government chemical weapon and missile sites in Syria, saying this was to stop them falling into the hands of extremists. It also said it would keep a \"limited\" troop presence in what had been a demilitarised buffer zone in part of the Golan Heights because Syrian troops had abandoned their posts there.",
      "Former Assad loyalists also appeared to be still in control of the Mediterranean coast and mountains in the west of the country. The region is a stronghold of Assad's minority Alawite sect and also the location of two key Russian military bases - Hmeimim airbase and the naval base in Tartous.",
      "How have world and regional powers reacted?",

      "US President Joe Biden said the collapse of the Assad government was a \"fundamental act of justice\" after decades of repression, but cautioned that the takeover by Islamist rebels created a moment of \"risk and uncertainty\".",

    "story": [
      "Syrian rebel leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani has dropped that nom de guerre associated with his jihadist past, and been using his real name, Ahmed al-Sharaa, in official communiques issued since Thursday, ahead of the fall of President Bashar al-Assad.",
      "This move is part of Jolani's effort to bolster his legitimacy in a new context, as his Islamist militant group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), leading other rebel factions, announces the capture of the Syrian capital, Damascus, solidifying its control over much of the country.",
      "Jolani's transformation is not recent, but has been carefully cultivated over the years, evident not only in his public statements and interviews with international outlets but also in his evolving appearance.",
      "Once clad in traditional jihadist militant attire, he has adopted a more Western-style wardrobe in the past years. Now, as he leads the offensive, he has donned military fatigues, symbolising his role as the commander of the operations room.",
      "But who is Jolani - or Ahmed al-Sharaa - and why and how has he changed?",

      "Listen to BBC Monitoring's podcast The Global Jigsaw: The rebels who retook Aleppo",
      "The IS-Iraq link",
      "A 2021 PBS interview with Jolani revealed that he was born in 1982 in Saudi Arabia, where his father worked as an oil engineer until 1989.",
      "In that year, the Jolani family returned to Syria, where he grew up and lived in the Mezzeh neighbourhood of Damascus.",
      "Jolani's journey as a jihadist began in Iraq, linked to al-Qaeda through the Islamic State (IS) group's precursor - al-Qaeda in Iraq and, later, the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI).",
      "After the 2003 US-led invasion, he joined other foreign fighters in Iraq and, in 2005, was imprisoned at Camp Bucca, where he enhanced his jihadist affiliations and later on was introduced to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the quiet scholar who would later go on to lead IS.",
      "In 2011, Baghdadi sent Jolani to Syria with funding to establish al-Nusra Front, a covert faction tied to ISI. By 2012, Nusra had become a prominent Syrian fighting force, hiding its IS and al-Qaeda ties.",
      "Tensions arose in 2013 when Baghdadi's group in Iraq unilaterally declared the merger of the two groups (ISI and Nusra), declaring the creation of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS), and publicly revealing for the first time the links between them.",
      "Jolani resisted, as he wanted to distance his group from ISI's violent tactics, leading to a split.",
      "To get out of that sticky situation, Jolani pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda, making Nusra Front its Syrian branch.",
      "From the start, he prioritised winning Syrian support, distancing himself from IS's brutality and emphasising a more pragmatic approach to jihad.",
      "Syria's Assad falls - follow live updates",
      "Syria's Assad falls - follow live updates",
      "Joining al-Qaeda",
      "In April 2013, al-Nusra Front became al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate, putting it at odds with IS.",
      "While Jolani's move was partly an attempt to maintain local support and avoid alienating Syrians and rebel factions, the al-Qaeda affiliation ultimately did little to benefit this effort.",
      "It became a pressing challenge in 2015 when Nusra and other factions captured Idlib province, forcing them to co-operate in its administration.",
      "In 2016, Jolani severed ties with al-Qaeda, rebranding the group as Jabhat Fatah al-Sham and later as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) in 2017.",
      "While initially appearing superficial, the split revealed deeper divisions. Al-Qaeda accused Jolani of betrayal, leading to defections and the formation of Hurras al-Din, a new al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria, which HTS later crushed in 2020. Members of Hurras al-Din, however, have remained cautiously present in the region.",
      "HTS also targeted IS operatives and foreign fighters in Idlib, dismantling their networks and forcing some to undergo \"deradicalisation\" programmes.",
      "These moves, justified as efforts to unify militant forces and reduce infighting, signalled Jolani's strategy to position HTS as a dominant and politically viable force in Syria.",
      "Despite the public split from al-Qaeda and name changes, HTS continued to be designated by the UN, US, UK and other countries as a terrorist organisation, and the US maintained a $10m reward for information about Jolani's whereabouts. Western powers considered the break-up to be a fa\u00e7ade.",
      "Forming a 'government' in Idlib",
      "Under Jolani, HTS became the dominant force in Idlib, north-west Syria's largest rebel stronghold and home to about four million people, many of whom were displaced from other Syrian provinces.",
      "To address concerns about a militant group governing the area, HTS established a civilian front, the so-called \"Syrian Salvation Government\" (SG) in 2017 as its political and administrative arm.",
      "The SG functioned like a state, with a prime minister, ministries and local departments overseeing sectors such as education, health and reconstruction, while maintaining a religious council guided by Sharia, or Islamic law.",
      "To reshape his image, Jolani actively engaged with the public, visiting displacement camps, attending events, and overseeing aid efforts, particularly during crises like the 2023 earthquakes.",
      "HTS highlighted achievements in governance and infrastructure to legitimise its rule and demonstrate its ability to provide stability and services.",
      "It has previously praised the Taliban, upon their return to power in 2021, lauding them as an inspiration and a model for effectively balancing jihadist efforts with political aspirations, including making tactical compromises to achieve their goals.",
      "Jolani's efforts in Idlib reflected his broader strategy to demonstrate HTS's ability not only to wage jihad but also to govern effectively.",
      "By prioritising stability, public services and reconstruction, he aimed to showcase Idlib as a model of success under HTS rule, enhancing both his group's legitimacy and his own political aspirations.",
      "But under his leadership, HTS has crushed and marginalised other militant factions, both jihadists and rebel ones, in its effort to consolidate its power and dominate the scene.",
      "Anti-HTS protests",
      "For over a year leading up to the HTS-led rebel offensive on 27 November, Jolani faced protests in Idlib from hardline Islamists as well as Syrian activists.",
      "Critics compared his rule to Assad's, accusing HTS of authoritarianism, suppressing dissent and silencing critics. Protesters labelled HTS's security forces as \"Shabbiha\", a term used to describe Assad's loyalist henchmen.",
      "They further alleged that HTS deliberately avoided meaningful combat against government forces and marginalised jihadists and foreign fighters in Idlib to prevent them from engaging in such actions, all to appease international actors.",
      "Even during the latest offensive, activists have persistently urged HTS to release individuals imprisoned in Idlib allegedly for expressing dissent.",
      "In response to these criticisms, HTS initiated several reforms over the past year. It disbanded or rebranded a controversial security force accused of human rights violations and established a \"Department of Grievances\" to allow citizens to lodge complaints against the group. Its critics said these measures were just a show to contain dissent.",
      "To justify its consolidation of power in Idlib and the suppression of plurality among militant groups, HTS argued that unifying under a single leadership was crucial for making progress and ultimately overthrowing the Syrian government.",
      "HTS and its civilian arm, the SG, walked a tightrope, striving to project a modern, moderate image to win over both the local population and the international community, while simultaneously maintaining their Islamist identity to satisfy hardliners within rebel-held areas and HTS's own ranks.",
      "For instance, in December 2023, HTS and the SG faced a backlash after a \"festival\" held at a glossy new shopping mall was criticised by hardliners as \"immoral\".",
      "And this August, a Paralympic Games-inspired ceremony drew sharp criticism from hardliners, prompting the SG to review the organisation of such events.",
      "These incidents illustrate the challenges HTS faces in reconciling the expectations of its Islamist base with the broader demands of the Syrian population, who are seeking freedom and coexistence after years of authoritarian rule under Assad.",
      "Leading a new path?",
      "As the latest offensive unfolded, global media focused on Jolani's jihadist past, prompting some rebel supporters to call for him to step back, viewing him as a liability.",
      "Although he previously expressed willingness to dissolve his group and step aside, his recent actions and public appearances tell a different story.",
      "HTS's success in uniting rebels and nearly capturing the whole country in under two weeks has strengthened Jolani's position, quieting hardline critics and accusations of opportunism.",
      "Jolani and the SG have since reassured domestic and international audiences.",
      "To Syrians, including minorities, they promised safety; to neighbours and powers like Russia, they pledged peaceful relations. Jolani even assured Russia its Syrian bases would remain unharmed if attacks ceased.",
      "This shift reflects HTS's \"moderate jihad\" strategy since 2017, emphasising pragmatism over rigid ideology.",
      "Jolani's approach could signal the decline of global jihad movements like IS and al-Qaeda, whose inflexibility is increasingly seen as ineffective and unsustainable.",
      "His trajectory might inspire other groups to adapt, marking either a new era of localised, politically flexible \"jihadism\" or just a temporary divergence from the traditional path in order to make political and territorial gains."

      "According to a law enforcement bulletin seen by US media, Mr Mangione was allegedly motivated by resentment at what he called \"parasitic\" health insurance companies.",
      "He had spent time in a surfing community in Hawaii, but left owing to debilitating back pain, say those who remember him. It is unclear, however, to what extent his own health troubles shaped his views of the medical industry.",
      "He was arrested on Monday at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, and was allegedly in possession of a gun, bullets, multiple fake IDs and cash.",
      "Mr Mangione also had a handwritten document that expressed \"ill will\" towards corporate America and included passages such as \"frankly, these parasites had it coming\", according to police.",
      "Investigators say the words \"deny\", \"defend\" and \"depose\" were written on shell casings found at the scene of Mr Thompson's murder.",
      "Law enforcement sources say this may be a reference to the \"three Ds of insurance\" - tactics used by companies to reject payment claims by patients.",

    "summary": "India's economy slumped to 5.4% , below the central bank's RBI's 7% forecast. What's going on?",
    "story": [
      "Is the world's fastest-growing big economy losing steam?",
      "The latest GDP numbers paint a sobering picture. Between July and September, India's economy slumped to a seven-quarter low of 5.4%, well below the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) forecast of 7%.",
      "While it is still robust compared with developed nations, the figure signals a slowdown.",
      "Economists attribute this to several factors. Consumer demand has weakened, private investment has been sluggish for years and government spending - an essential driver in recent years - has been pulled back. India's goods exports have long struggled, with their global share standing at a mere 2% in 2023.",
      "Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies report tepid sales, while salary bills at publicly traded firms, a proxy for urban wages, shrank last quarter. Even the previously bullish RBI has revised its growth forecast to 6.6% for the financial year 2024-2025.",
      "\"All hell seems to have broken loose after the latest GDP numbers,\" says economist Rajeshwari Sengupta. \"But this has been building up for a while. There's a clear slowdown and a serious demand problem.\"",
      "Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman paints a brighter picture. She said last week that the decline was \"not systemic\" but a result of reducing government spending during an election-focused quarter. She expected third-quarter growth to offset the recent decline. India will probably remain the fastest-growing major economy despite challenges like stagnant wages affecting domestic consumption, slowing global demand and climate disruptions in agriculture, Sitharaman said.",
      "Some \u2013 including a senior minister in the federal government, economists and a former member of RBI's monetary policy group \u2013 argue that the central bank's focus on curbing inflation has led to excessively restrictive interest rates, potentially stifling growth.",
      "High rates make borrowing more expensive for businesses and consumers, and potentially reduce investments and dampen consumption, both key drivers of economic growth. The RBI has kept interest rates unchanged for nearly two years, primarily because of rising inflation.",
      "India's inflation surged to 6.2% in October, breaching the central bank's target ceiling (4%) and reaching a 14-month high, according to official data. It was mainly  driven by food prices, comprising half of the consumer price basket \u2013 vegetable prices, for example, rose to more than 40% in October. There are also growing signs that food price hikes are now influencing other everyday costs, or core inflation.",
      "But high interest rates alone may not fully explain the slowing growth. \"Lowering rates won't spur growth unless consumption demand is strong. Investors borrow and invest only when demand exists, and that's not the case now,\" says Himanshu, a development economist at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University.",
      "However, RBI's outgoing governor, Shaktikanta Das, believes India's \"growth story remains intact\", adding the \"balance between inflation and growth is well poised\".",
      "Economists point out that despite record-high retail credit and rising unsecured loans - indicating people borrowing to finance consumption even amidst high rates - urban demand is weakening. Rural demand is a brighter spot, benefiting from a good monsoon and higher food prices.",
      "Ms Sengupta, an associate professor at Mumbai-based Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, told the BBC that the ongoing crisis was borne out by the fact that India's economy was operating on a \"two-speed trajectory\", driven by diverging performances in its \"old economy and new economy\".",
      "The old economy comprising the vast informal sector, including medium and small scale industries, agriculture and traditional corporate sector, are still waiting for long-pending reforms.",
      "In contrast, the new economy, defined by the boom in services exports post-Covid, experienced robust growth in 2022-23. Outsourcing 2.0 has been a key driver, with India emerging as the world's largest hub for global capability centres (GCCs), which do high-end offshore services work.",
      "According to Deloitte, a consulting firm, over 50% of the world's GCCs are now based in India. These centres focus on R&D, engineering design and consulting services, generating $46bn (\u00a336bn) in revenue and employing up to 2 million highly skilled workers.",
      "\"This influx of GCCs fuelled urban consumption by supporting demand for luxury goods, real estate and SUVs. For 2-2.5 years post-pandemic, this drove a surge in urban spending. With GCCs largely established and consumption patterns shifting, the urban spending lift is fading,\" says Ms Sengupta.",
      "So the old economy appears to lack a growth catalyst while the new economy slows. Private investment is crucial, but without strong consumption demand, firms will not invest. Without investment to create jobs and boost incomes, consumption demand cannot recover. \"It's a vicious cycle,\" says Ms Sengupta.",
      "There are other confusing signals as well. India's average tariffs have risen from 5% in 2013-14 to 17% now, higher than Asian peers trading with the US. In a world of global value chains, where exporters rely on imports from multiple countries, high tariffs make goods more expensive for companies to trade, making it harder for them to compete in global markets.",
      "Then there is what economist Arvind Subramanian calls a \"new twist in the tale\".",
      "Even as calls grow to lower interest rates and boost liquidity, the central bank is propping up a falling rupee by selling dollars, which tightens liquidity. Since October, the RBI has spent $50bn from its forex reserves to shield the rupee.",
      "Buyers must pay in rupees to purchase dollars, which reduces liquidity in the market. Maintaining a strong rupee through interventions reduces competitiveness by making Indian goods more expensive in global markets, leading to lower demand for exports.",
      "\"Why is the central bank shoring up the rupee? The policy is bad for the economy and exports. Possibly they are doing it because of optics. They don't want to show India's currency is weak,\" Mr Subramanian, a former economic adviser to the government, told the BBC.",
      "Critics warn that the \"hyping up the narrative\" of India as the fastest-growing economy is hindering essential reforms to boost investment, exports and job creation. \"We are still a poor country. Our per capita GDP is less than $3,000, while the US is at $86,000. If you say we are growing faster than them, it makes no sense at all,\" says Ms. Sengupta.",
      "In other words, India requires a significantly higher and sustained growth rate to generate more jobs and raise incomes.",
      "Boosting growth and consumption will not be easy in the short term. Lacking private investment, Himanshu suggests raising wages through government-run employment schemes to increase incomes and spur consumption. Others like Ms Sengupta advocate for reducing tariffs and attracting export investments moving away from China to countries like Vietnam.",
      "The government remains upbeat over the India story: banks are strong, forex reserves are robust, finances stable and extreme poverty has declined. Chief economic adviser V Anantha Nageswaran says the latest GDP figure should not be over-interpreted. \"We should not throw the baby out with the bathwater, as the underlying growth story remains intact,\" he said at a recent meeting.",
      "Clearly the pace of growth could do with some picking up. That is why scepticism lingers. \"There's no nation as ambitious for so long without taking [adequate] steps to fulfill that ambition,\" says Ms Sengupta. \"Meanwhile, the headlines talk of India's age and decade - I'm waiting for that to materialise.\""

      "Investigators say the black pistol allegedly recovered from Luigi Mangione, the suspect arrested in connection with the killing of a healthcare executive, appeared to be a ghost gun - a firearm that can be assembled at home.",

      "Here's what to know about these firearms.",
      "What is a ghost gun?",
      "Ghost guns are so-called because they are potentially untraceable. They can be assembled at home, either from scratch or through weapon parts kits, and they are not marked with serial numbers.",
      "The weapon allegedly carried by Mr Mangione in his backpack seems to have been typical. The arrest warrant described it as a \"semi-automatic pistol with what appears to be a 3D-printed loaded receiver with a metal slide and silencer\".",
      "Police said it was capable of firing 9mm rounds, and was consistent with the type of weapon used in the fatal shooting of Mr Thompson in New York the week before.",
      "The Biden administration, arguing in favour of regulating the firearms, has previously described ghost guns as being \"ridiculously easy\" to put together.",

      "According to figures from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), 20,000 suspected ghost guns were reported as being found by law enforcement in criminal investigations in 2022 - a tenfold increase from 2016.",

      "America was finding it \"very hard\" to restrict the firearm, said Ms Kayyem, former assistant secretary for policy at the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "More than 48,000 people were killed by firearms generally in the US in 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).",
      "Are ghost guns regulated?",
      "The killing has renewed scrutiny of ghost guns - which the Biden government has tried to regulate by saying they should be treated in the same way as commercially available firearms.",
      "Manufacturers of ghost gun kits are now required to include serial numbers on their products, and perform background checks on the purchasers.",
      "In October, the US Supreme Court signalled its willingness to uphold the law, which has been challenged by gun rights groups saying that authorities had overstepped the bounds of pre-existing legislation.",
      "A ruling that upholds the ATF's new regulation would mark a change for this Supreme Court, which has a conservative super-majority that has been largely sceptical of gun regulations.",

      "Some people argue mining the seabed is not financially viable. With technology moving so fast, these metals may not even be in demand by the time it gets going.",
      "But there are takers. And in 2022, the Cook Islands gave out three licences to companies to start exploring the possibility of deep-sea mining.",
      "They're now working with scientists in researching the environmental impact.",

      "While there's a growing call to delay deep-sea mining until regulations by the International Seabed Authority are drawn up, this only applies to international waters.",

      "With winter nights drawing in across North America, Canadian \u201csnowbirds\u201d \u2013 citizens who flee their freezing temperatures for sunnier climes every year \u2013 are planning their annual trips to Florida or the Caribbean.",
      "Traditionally, Cuba has been hugely popular among Canadians, drawn to the pristine white sands of beach resorts like Varadero.",
      "They fill the void left by Americans wary of the travel restrictions imposed on them under the continuing US economic embargo of the largest island in the Caribbean.",
      "Figures show that almost one million Canadian tourists visited Cuba last year, the top country of origin for visitors by some margin.",
      "As such, a recent decision by the Canadian tour operator, Sunwing Vacations Group \u2013 one of Cuba\u2019s leading travel partners \u2013 to remove 26 hotels from its Cuba portfolio is a blow to the island\u2019s struggling tourism industry.",
      "Sunwing took the decision after Cuba endured a four-day nationwide blackout at the end of October, caused by failures with the country's aging energy infrastructure.",
      "This was followed by another national power cut last month, when Hurricane Rafael barrelled its way across the island, worsening an already-acute electricity crisis.",
      "A third countrywide blackout then happened on Wednesday, 4 Dec, after Cuba's largest power plant broke down.",
      "\u201cCuba has had some volatility in the last few weeks and that may shake consumer confidence,\u201d Sunwing\u2019s chief marketing officer, Samantha Taylor told the Pax News travel website last month.",
      "\u201cThere are incredible places to go in Cuba,\u201d she stressed, keen to emphasise that the company isn\u2019t pulling out of Cuba altogether. \u201cBut we also recognise that if clients are a little uncomfortable, we need to give them options.\u201d",
      "Specifically, that involved drawing up a list of what they called \u201chidden gems\u201d \u2013 alternative holiday destinations in the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas and Colombia.",
      "The implications for Cuba are clear.",
      "With tourism now the island\u2019s principal economic motor, and the main source of foreign currency earnings after remittances, that an important tour operator is pointing its customers towards other countries\u2019 beaches over crumbling energy infrastructure is a real concern.",
      "\u201cOur message to Canadians is that tourism is one of the economy\u2019s priorities,\u201d said Lessner G\u00f3mez, director of the Cuban Tourism Board in Toronto in a statement. \u201cThe Ministry of Tourism has been preparing for the winter season to deliver better services, uninterrupted supplies, a better airport experience, and more and new car rentals.\u201d",
      "While Cuba\u2019s tourism agency tries to ease fears about the extent of the electricity blackouts, few can deny that these have been extremely difficult months on the island. Hurricane Rafael was only the latest storm to hit Cuba in a frenetic Atlantic hurricane season in which more powerful and more frequent storms are the new normal.",
      "Of course, severe weather is a problem across the Caribbean. But for Cuba, there are other complications in play.",
      "Donald Trump\u2019s re-election to the White House and his choice for Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, stand to make life even more complicated for Cubans than it already is.",
      "\u201cThis is probably the Cuban Revolution\u2019s hardest moment,\u201d says former Cuban diplomat, Jes\u00fas Arboleya. \u201cAnd unfortunately, I see nothing on the horizon whatsoever which allows for an optimistic view of the future of US-Cuba relations.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump has handed US policy towards Cuba to those sectors of the Cuban American right who have essentially lived off anti-Castro policies since their origins.\u201d",
      "Mr Arboleya adds that Marco Rubio, currently a US Senator for Florida, is the leading voice among them. He is a Cuban American long opposed to the communist government in Havana.",
      "His parents were Cubans who moved to the US in 1956, three years before Fidel Castro seized power, but his grandfather fled the Castro-led turn to communism on the island.",
      "\u201cPeople are horrified by the idea of another Donald Trump presidency. It spells real trouble,\u201d echoes Cuban political commentator and editor of Temas magazine, Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez.",
      "Current US policy towards Cuba is \u201csomewhat schizophrenic\u201d, he argues.",
      "\u201cOn the one hand, the State Department facilitates support to the private sector, and [pushes for] economic changes in Cuba. But on the other hand, Congress and Senate seem to freeze any advances on those reforms.\u201d",
      "The expectation is, however, that a future Secretary of State Rubio will coalesce the US\u2019s Cuba policy around a single idea - maximum pressure on the island by tightening the already-harsh sanctions.",
      "Cubans fear that could mean the suspension of commercial flights to Cuba, or even the closure of the US Embassy in Havana, which was officially reopened in 2015 after decades of frosty relations.",
      "If implemented, such steps would be deliberately designed to further harm Cuba\u2019s floundering tourism trade, the aim to hit the communist-run nation when it\u2019s down. Tourist numbers to Cuba have almost halved since the high point of nearly five million visitors during the Obama-era d\u00e9tente with Cuba.",
      "Between 2015-2017 US visitors flocked to the island under more relaxed travel restrictions, keen to experience a country that had long been denied them. Around the same time, the Cuban government embarked on a major hotel-building spree, confident that demand would remain strong over the next decade.",
      "However, there followed a double blow to Cuban tourism from which it hasn\u2019t fully recovered. First, the Trump Administration rolled back President Obama\u2019s engagement policies, and then the Covid-19 pandemic sent the industry into freefall.",
      "With many of those hotels now registering much lower occupancy rates than originally predicted, and real difficulties in providing the five-star customer experience as advertised amid the blackouts and shortages, some question the strategy of putting so many eggs in the tourism basket in the first place.",
      "\u201cWhy has Cuba invested 38% [of government funds] on average over the past decade in hotels and infrastructure connected to international tourism, but only 8 to 9% on energy infrastructure?\u201d asks economist Ricardo Torres at the American University in Washington DC. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense. The hotels run on electricity.\u201d",
      "Even with all the current challenges, most visitors agree that Cuba remains a unique travel experience. The cliches \u2013 classic cars, cigars and mojitos \u2013 still appeal to many, while others prefer to travel the island absorbing its history, culture and music.",
      "Yet as tour operator Sunwings\u2019 decision to step back shows, some tourists are finding it hard to appreciate Cuba during its energy crisis, especially if it\u2019s about to be exacerbated by a hostile administration \u2013 and Secretary of State \u2013 in Washington."

    "published": "Sun, 08 Dec 2024 01:56:57 GMT",
    "summary": "France's nuclear giant has lost control of its uranium mining operations in the West African state.",
    "story": [
      "In the latest sign of a dramatic deterioration in relations, Niger's military rulers appear increasingly determined to drive France out of any significant sector in their economy - and particularly uranium mining.",
      "This week the French state nuclear company Orano announced that the junta - which deposed France's ally, President Mohamed Bazoum, in a coup in July 2023 - had taken operational control of its local mining firm, Soma\u00efr.",
      "The company's efforts to resume exports have for months been blocked by the regime and it is being pushed into financial crisis.",
      "And the impact could be felt more widely - although Niger accounts for less than 5% of the uranium produced globally, in 2022 it accounted for a quarter of the supply to nuclear power plants across Europe.",
      "So the timing could hardly be more awkward, as Western countries struggle to meet the challenge of climate change and cut their carbon emissions from electricity generation.",
      "For French President Emmanuel Macron, already wrestling with political crisis at home, the potential departure of Orano from Niger is certainly awkward in image terms.",
      "For it coincides with bruising news from other long-standing African partners - Chad has suddenly announced the ending of a defence agreement with Paris, while Senegal has confirmed its insistence on the eventual closure of the French military base in Dakar.",
      "But in any case, the crisis facing Orano in Niger represents a significant practical challenge for French energy supply.",
      "With 18 nuclear plants, totalling 56 reactors, which generate almost 65% of its electricity, France has been ahead of the game in containing carbon emissions from the power sector.",
      "But the country's own limited production of uranium ended more than 20 years ago.",
      "So, over the past decade or so, it has imported almost 90,000 tonnes - a fifth of which has come from Niger. Only Kazakhstan - which accounts for 45% of global output - was a more important source of supply.",
      "The continuing paralysis, or the definitive shutdown, of Orano's operations in Niger would certainly force France to look elsewhere.",
      "This should be achievable, as alternative supplies can be obtained from countries including Uzbekistan, Australia and Namibia.",
      "Last year, as West African neighbours responded to the coup in Niger by imposing a trade blockade that paralysed uranium exports, other suppliers readily stepped into the breach.",
      "The European Union's imports of the mineral from the country plunged by a third, but these were largely replaced by Canada.",
      "But there was also a politically awkward price to pay. EU imports of uranium from Russia rose by more than 70%, despite the heavy sanctions imposed on Moscow because of its invasion of Ukraine.",
      "And of course, it is Russia which has become the new best friend of the military leaders who have seized power in Niger and its allied neighbours, Burkina Faso and Mali, since 2020.",
      "Russian military contractors fight alongside the Malian army in its campaign against jihadists and ethnic Tuareg separatists, while they also help to protect the senior leadership of the juntas in Niger and Burkina Faso.",
      "So although France, and Europe more generally, would be able to find ways to cope with a definitive loss of Niger's uranium supply, the shift would not be entirely comfortable.",
      "In the short-term at least, EU states would probably become more reliant on Russia and its central Asian neighbours, thus undermining their own effort to maintain economic pressure on President Vladimir Putin during a potentially crucial period in the Ukraine crisis.",
      "Moreover, Niger's regime, whose attitude towards the EU as a whole has become almost as mistrustful as its broken relationship with France, continues to seek alternatives to its old Western partnerships.",
      "And Iran - a potential customer, of course, for uranium - has emerged as an option.",
      "Contacts between the two governments have deepened, with Niger's Prime Minister Ali Mahamane Lamine Zeine visiting Tehran in January. Rumours of a possible deal for the supply of uranium \"yellowcake\" (concentrate) briefly circulated a few months ago.",
      "Meanwhile, the outlook for Orano's hopes of restoring normal uranium operations and exports from Niger look dim, given the hostile attitude of the military regime in Niamey.",
      "That antipathy is partly explained by Macron's vocal condemnation of the July 2023 overthrow of Bazoum, who had been one of his closest African political and security partners.",
      "Paris firmly endorsed the tough stance of the West African regional grouping Ecowas, and there were even rumours that it might have been ready to provide tacit support had the bloc ever gone ahead with its short-lived threat to intervene militarily in Niger to reinstate Bazoum.",
      "In this poisonous atmosphere of hostility and mistrust, Orano was an obvious and convenient target for junta retaliation.",
      "The French company's predominant role in the uranium sector had for years fuelled resentment among many Nig\u00e9riens, amidst claims that the French company was buying their uranium on the cheap, despite periodic renegotiations of the export deal. Although the mining operations only started years after independence, they were seen as emblematic of France's ongoing post-colonial influence.",
      "After last year's coup, Orano itself tried to stay out of the diplomatic row, keep a low profile and carry on operating normally.",
      "But the Ecowas trade blockade prevented it from exporting the output from the Soma\u00efr mine, near Arlit, in the Sahara Desert.",
      "And even after the sanctions were lifted in late February, the usual uranium export route, via Benin's port of Cotonou, remained blocked, because the junta kept the border closed in an ongoing political row with Benin.",
      "Orano offered to fly the uranium out, but the regime shunned this suggestion.",
      "In June the junta cancelled the French company's rights to develop a new mine at the large Imouraren deposit, which had been seen as the uranium sector's principal new hope for future growth.",
      "Meanwhile, the export blockage was pushing Soma\u00efr, which by November was sitting on 1,150 tonnes of blockaded stocks of uranium concentrate worth $210m (\u00a3165m), into financial crisis.",
      "And when Orano decided to halt further production and prioritise the payment of workforce salaries, relations with the government deteriorated further into this week's almost total breakdown.",
      "Of course, it is not just the company but also Niger's economy that pays a price for this situation, in lost export earnings and risking hundreds of jobs.",
      "For Arlit and other communities in the desert north, this would be a devastating blow, despite talk of revived activity at a Chinese mining project in the region and some interest in the sector among other potential partners.",
      "But Niger's junta feels no need to make concessions to Orano because it is now buoyed by a sharp rise in oil exports, thanks to a new Chinese-built pipeline.",
      "With that financial cushion, the regime appears prepared to bear the cost of paralysing and probably dismantling the traditional uranium partnership with France - now its main international opponent.",

    "summary": "Shanthi tried her best to create a sense of normality for her children on the remote British island Diego Garcia.",
    "story": [
      "It's morning in a makeshift camp on the remote British island of Diego Garcia, and Shanthi's husband has just awoken to find their young children staring through a security fence.",
      "As the children watch an officer and guard dog patrol the secretive island, home to a strategic UK-US military base in the middle of the Indian Ocean, they make a stark remark: \"Even the dogs have more freedom than us.\"",
      "\"When I heard that I felt heartbroken,\" he says.",
      "It was a scene that captured their family's predicament - they were stranded on a mysterious military fortress by accident, yet had a son and daughter, aged five and nine, to raise.",
      "In an effort to find normality in the tiny camp they were housed in under constant surveillance, the family found ways to entertain themselves, to study, grow food and celebrate special occasions.",
      "Shanthi, not her real name, says they had paid $5,000 (\u00a33,900) in savings and given all of her gold jewellery to smugglers for an ambitious journey to Canada, more than 12,000 km away, with dozens of other Sri Lankan Tamils.",
      "They all said they were fleeing persecution in Sri Lanka and India, some because of links with the former Tamil Tiger rebels who were defeated in the civil war that ended in 2009.",
      "The fishing boat they were in leaked in rough seas, prompting their rescue by the Royal Navy who took them in October 2021 to Diego Garcia - and they were placed in the fenced-off migrant camp. Shanthi remembers her son asking if they had arrived in Canada.",
      "Her young children received no formal education on the island for the first six months there so, as a trained teacher, Shanthi began giving English lessons to the children in the camp.",
      "\"We started with the basics - the alphabet, nouns, verbs, present continuous,\" she says.",
      "Shanthi's husband later built a writing desk out of wooden pallets so the children could do homework in the tent.",
      "The children soon began to complain of boredom in the evenings so Shanthi - who had trained in Bharatanatyam, an Indian classical dance - began giving dance lessons, too, playing music downloaded from her phone.",
      "Three years after the family first arrived in the camp, they were finally sent to the UK this week in what the government described as a \"one off\" case in the interests of their welfare.",
      "\"It's like an open prison - we were not allowed to go outside, we were just living in a fence and in a tent,\" Shanthi, aged in her early 30s, says in an interview on the outskirts of London.",
      "\"Every day our life was the same.\"",
      "It was like living \"in a cage,\" she adds.",
      "While guards watched and military jets occasionally roared overhead, Shanthi and the other Tamils approached British forces on the island with a letter asking to be sent to a safe country. It marked the first time that asylum claims had ever been filed in the territory.",
      "This sparked a lengthy legal battle 6,000 miles away in the UK, and while that took its course, Shanthi and the others stuck there, took matters into her own hands.",
      "While the Tamils were not allowed to cook their own food, the camp was full of coconut trees, and Shanthi and others used the husks to line planters in which they grew their own vegetables - chilli, garlic and cucumber.",
      "\"They would sometimes give us red chilis so we dried them in the sun and collected the seeds and then grew them. In the salad sometimes we'd get cucumber so we collected the seeds and kept them in the sunlight and after they dried they would grow,\" she says.",
      "Every day, they would make sambol - a popular Sri Lankan side dish - by mashing the coconut and chilli.",
      "They struggled to eat the American food served to them from the base, and would put the vegetables in hot water with garlic and chilli to try to make curries.",
      "With limited access to clothing, particularly for the 16 children in the camp, Shanthi and other women stitched dresses from bed sheets. Come Christmas time, they turned paper napkins into flowers, and cut moon and star shapes out of food containers to decorate a tree.",
      "Relations with the guards that watched over them were often tense, but at Diwali, Shanthi says an \"officer with a good heart brought us a biryani\". On another occasion, a guard brought a cake for her son, who had been counting down the days to his birthday.",
      "But as time went on, Shanthi says, the feelings of helplessness grew.",
      "Life in the camp was to exist in a bubble - news of major wars breaking out in Ukraine and the Middle East trickled through from the guards watching over the migrants, but they were kept away from the base and consumed by their own lives.",
      "Access to the island, part of the Chagos Archipelago, is heavily restricted. It has officially had no resident population since the early 1970s when the UK evicted all the people living there so it could develop the strategic base.",
      "\"From day one until we left, every day we were living with rats,\" Shanthi says. \"Sometimes the rats would bite our children - their legs, fingers and hands. They stole our food. At nights sometimes they would crawl over our blankets and our heads.\"",
      "Giant coconut crabs and tropical fire ants would also crawl into the camp.",
      "During storms, rain water would pour in through holes in the tents, which had previously been used for Covid patients in the pandemic.",
      "When United Nations investigators visited the camp late last year, the children told them they dreamed of going for a picnic, riding a bike or eating an ice cream.",
      "At one point earlier this year, a medical official described the camp as being in \"complete crisis\", with mass self-harming and incidents of attempted suicide.",
      "\"My daughter was watching everything that happened. She'd say 'mum they've cut themselves. Should I cut myself?' So I'd say 'no, no. You can't do anything. I'll protect you. Come and listen to some music, come and take some paper and just draw,'\" she recalls through tears.",
      "Both she and her husband sob as they talk about the two times their daughter self-harmed.",
      "\"Both times I felt really bad and couldn't process it. When she did this, she told me she did it because she hoped if she died her parents and her brother would go to a safe third country,\" Shanthi says.",
      "There were also cases and allegations of sexual assault and harassment within the camp by other migrants, including against children.",
      "\"Over three years we suffered so much. I don't know how we survived,\" Shanthi says.",
      "Throughout the Tamils' time on the island, British authorities acknowledged that it was not a suitable place for them, and said they were looking for long-term solutions. The government said the group's wellbeing and safety was the \"top priority\".",
      "Shanthi says the happiest moment in the camp came recently when officials announced that they would be brought to the UK, where they would be given the right to remain for six months. Shanthi says no one in the camp slept that night.",
      "Upon arriving in the UK, Shanthi says she was struck by \"the cold\" - and it felt like waking from a coma. She had forgotten how to download apps, send WhatsApp messages or pay in shops.",
      "Her children talk of starting school, making friends and riding a double-decker bus.",
      "But the family's long-term future remains uncertain. They have now filed asylum claims in the UK in hopes of remaining. If unsuccessful, they will likely be returned to Sri Lanka.",
      "The UK agreed earlier this year to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius in a historic move. Under the deal, which has still to be signed, Diego Garcia would continue to operate as a UK-US military base but Mauritius would take responsibility for any future migrant arrivals.",

      "But it was the news of Prithvi Shaw - Pant's Delhi Capitals teammate - going unsold that grabbed more attention.",
      "Among those seated in the auction in positions to make bids were Sourav Ganguly and Ricky Ponting, who had been closely associated with Shaw in his years with Capitals, as also Rahul Dravid, who was coach when India won the under-19 World Cup under Shaw in 2018.",
      "Their disinterest was telling. Shaw found no takers.",
      "Ironically, just nine months earlier, before the start of the 2024 IPL season, it was Pant whose career looked in jeopardy.",
      "A horrific car crash in December 2022 had left him with multiple life-threatening injuries. But showing iron will, great determination and self-discipline, Pant fought his way back from what seemed a dead-end to his career.",
      "Pant faced the challenges of IPL 2024 head-on and excelled, earning a rapid recall to international cricket. He was part of the T20 World Cup-winning squad. Dominating the domestic season, he impressed in the domestic Duleep Trophy, paving the way for a sensational return to Test cricket. Against Bangladesh, he lit up the field with a scorching century.",
      "Shaw, meanwhile, under pressure after a couple of poor IPL seasons, has lurched from one crisis to another.",
      "His indifferent form in IPL 2024 saw him lose his place in the playing XI mid-season. A spate of low scores in the current domestic season saw him lose his place in the Mumbai Ranji Trophy team too. And an outright rejection in the IPL mega auction has brought his career to the precipice of a premature end.",

      "Tendulkar's spectacular rise to eminence following his world record 664-runs partnership with Vinod Kambli in a school game way back in 1987, had inspired quite a few batting prodigies, especially from Mumbai. Shaw was one of them.",
      "A short and stocky opening batsman, Shaw did not have the technical virtuosity Tendulkar had even as a teenager. But he had a gift of timing, and took the attack to the bowlers with such panache that selectors were instantly enamoured.",
      "He was fast-tracked into first-class cricket, like Tendulkar, scoring a century on debut in the domestic Ranji and Duleep Trophy, which hardened comparisons between the two.",
      "In late 2018, he got a Test call-up against the West Indies. Shaw hit 134 off just 154 deliveries, studded with rifle-shot drives, cuts and pulls. He was barely 19. Only Tendulkar among Indians had scored his maiden Test century at a younger age.",
      "Touted as a worthy successor to Tendulkar and Virat Kohli, Shaw had the world at his feet. But he's been on a slippery slope since.",
      "Six years after his sensational debut he played in only four more Tests. Add six ODIs and a solitary T20i, it still makes for a dismal aggregate of international appearances for a batsman whose precocity had promised a long, dazzling career.",
      "An unfortunate foot injury, which saw him being sent back from the tour of Australia in 2020 was the start of Shaw's problems. Later that year, he tested positive for a banned substance and was lucky to get away with a light sentence. Thereafter his batting form started declining steadily, touching excellence agonisingly infrequently to impress selectors.",
      "Meanwhile stories of Shaw getting embroiled in wild parties and brawls started to spread. By the middle of IPL 2024, he was on notice, as it were. After the IPL 2025 mega auction, his career seems engulfed in uncertainty.",
      "Injury, illness, and poor form can derail even the best, but those close to Shaw reveal that misfortune has played only a minor role in his precarious downfall.",
      "Ricky Ponting, who as Delhi Capitals coach worked closely with Shaw, says: \"There's only so much [advice] you can give and only so many times you can try [to sort him out] .\"",
      "Former India batsman Praveen Amre, who was assistant coach with Delhi Capitals was more direct. \"Prithvi\u2019s inability to handle IPL fame and money has been his undoing. I\u2019ve talked to him several times, giving him the example of Vinod Kambli who frittered away his career for the lack of discipline,\u2019\u2019 Amre told a national daily.",
      "The IPL has revolutionised young players\u2019 lives, offering a platform for talent and livelihood. Yet, the challenges of early success, instant fame,and rapid wealth remain pressing. Rahul Dravid, drawing on his experience as U-19 and India A coach, has emphasised the need for stronger junior-level mentoring to keep players on track. Shaw\u2019s struggles underscore the importance of his insight.",
      "What the future holds for Shaw time will tell.",
      "At 25, he still has age on his side. But Indian cricket is overflowing with talent, and competition for places is intense. The path from here is all uphill.",
      "\"Some of the greatest sports stories are comeback stories, If Prithvi Shaw has decent people around him who care about his long term success, they\u2019d sit him down, tell him to get off social media & train his absolute backside off in getting super fit. It\u2019ll get him back into the correct path where past success can return. Too talented to throw it all away,\" Former England captain Kevin Pietersen posted on X.",
      "The message to Shaw is clear. Redemption lies in his own hands.",

    "published": "Sat, 07 Dec 2024 01:18:02 GMT",
    "summary": "President Yoon Suk-yeol's martial law announcement left many Koreans with one thought: not again.",
    "story": [
      "Koh Jae-hak can still vividly remember when he saw policemen gunning down a group of young women in cold blood.",
      "It was April 1960. Students had launched protests calling for the resignation of the dictatorial president Syngman Rhee. Mr Koh was working in a government building when he looked out of the window and saw protesters clashing with police.",
      "\"There were demonstrations from various universities, and they all gathered in front\u2026 that's when shots were fired,\" the 87-year-old said. Days later, martial law was declared.",
      "South Korea is widely considered a peaceful beacon of democracy in Asia, but that wasn't always the case. This is a country that saw 16 bouts of martial law during its first four decades ruled largely by dictators.",
      "It is why democracy is now deeply treasured by South Koreans as a hard-won right. It is also why President Yoon Suk Yeol's declaration of martial law this week \u2013 the first to happen in 45 years and during democratic rule - was particularly triggering and prompted such a visceral response.",
      "Almost immediately, lawmakers jumped out of bed and rushed to the national assembly, clambering over fences to reverse martial law.",
      "Hundreds of ordinary citizens gathered to hold back troops who had been ordered to throw out MPs.",
      "Some soldiers, apparently unwilling to carry out their orders, reportedly dragged their feet in clearing the crowd and entering the building.",
      "When Yoon declared martial law on Tuesday night, he said it was necessary to get rid of \"pro-North anti-state\" forces. Initially, it caused confusion with some South Koreans who believed there was a genuine threat from the North.",
      "But as they continued watching Yoon's televised announcement, many grew sceptical. He gave no evidence of such forces at work, nor explained who they were. As Yoon had previously used similar language to describe the opposition that had been stymying his reforms, the public concluded he was actually trying to crush his political foes.",
      "Previous periods of martial law had also been justified by leaders as necessary to stabilise the country, and sometimes stamp out what they alleged were communist subversives planted by North Korea.",
      "They curtailed freedom of press and freedom of movement. Night curfews and arrests were common.",
      "Violent clashes sometimes took place, most indelibly in 1980, when then President Chun Doo-hwan extended martial law to deal with student protesters calling for democracy in the southern city of Gwangju. A brutal military crackdown was launched, and it has since been labelled a massacre \u2013 while the official death toll is 193, some experts believe hundreds more died.",
      "South Korea eventually transitioned to democracy in 1988, when the government held its first free and fair presidential election following mounting public pressure. But the preceding decades had permanently and profoundly shaped the nation's consciousness.",
      "\"Most Koreans have trauma, deep trauma, about martial law,\" said Kelly Kim, 53, an environmental activist. \"We don't want to repeat the same thing over and over.\"",
      "Ms Kim was a young child when martial law was last in place and has little memory of it. Still, she shudders at the thought of it returning.",
      "\"The government would control all the media, our normal activities. I'm working in civil society, so all our activities, like criticising the government, would not be possible under the martial law. So that's really horrible.\"",
      "Fear, fury and triumph: Six hours that shook South Korea",
      "'We had to stop this': Woman who grabbed South Korean soldier's gun speaks to BBC",
      "Yoon Suk Yeol, South Korea's scandal-hit president who declared martial law",
      "The freedoms afforded by democracy have not just led to a thriving civil society.",
      "In the more than 35 years since that first democratic election, South Korea's creative industries have flourished, with its dramas, TV shows, music and literature becoming world famous. Those creative industries have turned their own lenses onto the country's past, bringing history to life for those too young to remember.",
      "The country has seen a proliferation of shows about its dictatorship past, immortalising incidents such as the Gwangju uprising in popular culture.",
      "Some were blockbusters featuring South Korea's biggest stars, such as last year's 12.12 The Day, a historical drama starring popular actor Hwang Jung-min. The movie depicts the political chaos that took place in 1979 as martial law was declared following the assassination of then president Park Chung-hee.",
      "\"As soon as I saw the images [of Yoon's declaration of martial law], it reminded me of that movie\u2026 it made me question, are we about to repeat that history now?\" said Marina Kang, a 37-year-old web designer.",
      "\"Korea's got a wealth of visual representational works [of that era] in films and documentaries. Though we only have indirect experience of the horrific past through these works\u2026 that still makes me feel very strongly that such events should not happen again.\"",
      "Among younger citizens, there is a sense of disbelief that it could have returned. Despite never knowing life under martial law, they have been taught by their parents and older relatives to fear it.",
      "\"At first [when I heard Yoon's announcement], I was excited at the thought of getting a day off from school. But that joy was fleeting, and I was overwhelmed by the fear of daily life collapsing. I couldn't sleep,\" said 15-year-old Kwon Hoo.",
      "\"My father was concerned that under martial law, he wouldn't be able to stay out late even though his work required him to\u2026 when he heard the news about the possibility of a curfew being imposed again, he started swearing while watching the news.\"",
      "Not all South Koreans feel this way about their past.",
      "\"The vast majority of Koreans appreciate democracy enormously and regret the authoritarianism of the post-war period,\" said Mason Richey, associate professor of international politics at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul.",
      "But, he added, \"the country remains very divided regarding numerous aspects of the authoritarian past, notably how justified certain repressive measures were in order to prevent communist subversion.\"",
      "There is the view among a significant portion of the population, especially among older folk, that martial law was necessary in the past for stability and democracy.",
      "\"Back then, it was a time defined by ideological warfare between democracy and communist socialism,\" said Kang Hyo-san, 83. He was sitting next to his friend Mr Koh in a cafe at Gwanghwamun, Seoul's main square and focal point for the city's protest rallies.",
      "The competing ideologies would lead to clashes and \"when the military intervened, the situation would stabilise\u2026 it was a process to restore order and properly establish free democracy.",
      "\"Given the circumstances, we couldn't help but view it positively,\" he said, adding that he felt each period of martial law left the country in a more \"favourable\" position. Martial law in South Korea \"fundamentally differed\" from other nations, where it \"wasn't about killing people or senseless violence\", he insisted.",
      "But this time, it's different. Both octogenarians felt that Yoon's declaration of martial law was unacceptable. \"Even though we've experienced martial law many times throughout our lives, this time there's no justification for its declaration,\" said Mr Koh.",
      "Like them, Ms Kim, the environmental activist, was glad Yoon did not succeed and democracy prevailed in the end. \"Because we fought so hard to get it, right? We don't want to lose it again.",
      "\"Without democracy and freedom of living, what is life?\"",

      "Rappers Jay-Z and Sean \"Diddy\" Combs have been accused in a civil lawsuit of raping a 13-year-old girl back in 2000.",
      "The lawsuit, which was originally filed in October and re-filed Sunday in New York to add Jay-Z to the list of defendants, alleges that the victim, identified only as a woman now living in Alabama, was raped by both men at a Video Music Awards afterparty.",
      "Jay-Z, whose real name is Shawn Carter, referred to the allegations in a statement as a \"blackmail attempt.\" Combs' attorney denied the allegations.",
      "The lawsuit alleges the girl went to the VMAs in New York City without a ticket hoping to get inside, but was instead invited to an afterparty by a limo driver who claimed to work for Combs. The limo driver allegedly drove her to the party, where she was told to sign something that she believes was a non-disclosure agreement, the lawsuit claims.",
      "While inside, the lawsuit alleges, \"after attempting to talk to numerous celebrities, Plaintiff accepted a drink from one of the waitresses circulating the crowd.\" The lawsuit claims she began to feel \"woozy and lightheaded\" after drinking \"a portion of the drink\" and went to find a place to lie down. She went into a room that had a bed in it and, shortly after lying down, Combs, Carter and an unnamed woman celebrity whom the alleged victim recognized entered the room, the lawsuit claims.",
      "The lawsuit then alleges that Carter held her down and raped her while Combs and the woman celebrity watched. After, Combs also raped her while Carter and the woman watched, the suit claims. Combs then attempted to force the girl to perform oral sex on him, but she managed to punch him, grab her clothes, wrap them around her \u00a0and run away, according to the lawsuit.",
      "\"Although there were other guests still at the party, no one appeared to take notice of Plaintiff's distress or attempted to help her,\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "According to the lawsuit, after leaving the house and putting her clothes back on, the girl managed to run back to a gas station she had seen on the way to the party, where a clerk \"noticed her distress and allowed her to use the phone.\" She then allegedly used the phone to call her father and have him pick her up.",
      "The woman is seeking unspecified damages.",

What he had calculated was the nature of these allegations and the public scrutiny would make me want to settle. No sir, it had the opposite effect! It made me want to expose you for the fraud you are in a VERY public fashion. So no, I will not give you ONE RED PENNY!!\"",
      "\"Only your network of conspiracy theorists, fake physics, will believe the idiotic claims you have levied against me that, if not for the seriousness surrounding harm to kids, would be laughable,\" the statement added.",

He is not mentioned, referenced, or implicated in any way in the criminal investigation of Mr. Combs. He is neither a target nor a person of interest in that investigation.\"",

      "Buzbee was sued last month by an anonymous male celebrity, who alleges the lawyer tried to extort payments by threatening to file allegations of sexual assault, which the celebrity denies. Buzbee, in return, denies the extortion allegations.",
      "Buzbee did not immediately respond to a CBS News request for comment. In a statement posted Sunday night on X, Buzbee alleged that Carter was behind the anonymous lawsuit against him.",
      "\"What he fails to say in his recent statement is my firm sent his lawyer a demand letter on behalf of an alleged victim and that victim never demanded a penny from him. Instead, she only sought a confidential mediation,\" Buzbee wrote. \"Since I sent the letter on her behalf, Mr. Carter has not only sued me, but he has tried to bully and harass me and this plaintiff. His conduct has had the opposite impact. She is emboldened. I'm very proud of her resolve.\"",
      "Buzbee also wrote on Instagram that there has been a \"coordinated and aggressive effort\" against him that has included \"filing frivolous cases against me and my law firm, defaming me with outrageous assertions to anyone who will listen, and having mysterious people follow me and my family.\"",
      "\"People will see through this effort to discredit me and my clients and the truth will be revealed. I also won't allow anyone to scare my clients into silence,\" Buzbee wrote.",
      "Combs is currently in custody in New York as he awaits trial on federal sex trafficking charges. His attempts to secure bail have been denied several times.",
      "Combs was arrested in September and charged with sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and transportation to engage in prostitution, with prosecutors accusing him of using his business empire to engage in repeated abuses over the years. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.",

      "As part of a settlement first\u00a0announced\u00a0in December 2022, the video game maker has been ordered by the FTC to pay $245 million to resolve allegations that it used unlawful billing practices involving design tricks\u00a0known as dark patterns to get players to unintentionally rack up charges. It is the largest ever refund amount in a gaming case, the agency said.",
      "The FTC says it is sending more than 629,000 payments Monday, with more disbursements to come at a later date. About half of the first tranche of payments will be made through PayPal, and the other half will be checks. Collectively, customers will receive $72 million in refunds, according to the agency.",
      "How much money will each customer get?",
      "The average payment is around $114, the FTC said. Epic Games customers who are entitled to refunds selected their payment method when they submitted a claim form. Customers who chose to receive PayPal payments have 30 days to redeem the funds, while check recipients have 90 days to cash them.",
      "What did Epic Games do?",
      "The FTC alleges the Fortnite-maker used dark patterns along with a variety of other tactics to trick customers into making unwanted purchases.",
      "For example, a \"counterintuitive, inconsistent, and confusing button configuration\" led Fortnite players to easily incur unwanted charges with the press of a single button, according to the FTC. Additionally, trying to transition the game from sleep to wake mode often triggered unwanted purchases. Other times, pressing an \"adjacent button\" while trying to preview an item led to a charge.",
      "\"As our complaints note, Epic used privacy-invasive default settings and deceptive interfaces that tricked Fortnite users, including teenagers and children,\" FTC Chair Lina M. Khan said in December 2022, when the settlement was first announced. \"Protecting the public, and especially children, from online privacy invasions and dark patterns is a top priority for the Commission, and these enforcement actions make clear to businesses that the FTC is cracking down on these unlawful practices.\"",

    "summary": "Selena Gomez is up for two acting awards at the 2025 Golden Globes for her roles in the film \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" and the series \"Only Murders in the Building.\"",
    "story": [
      "Awards season kicked off with a bang for Selena Gomez, who on Monday received Golden Globe nominations for her performances on both the big and small screens.",
      "Gomez, who was already a two-time Golden Globe nominee, earned nods this year in the categories for best actress in a musical or comedy TV series and best supporting actress in a motion picture. Mindy Kaling and Morris Chestnut unveiled the nominees in a televised presentation Monday morning at the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles.",
      "The best actress nomination went to Gomez for her role in the Hulu mystery series \"Only Murders in the Building,\" which she reprised for a fourth run in August after previously gleaning acclaim for her work on its earlier seasons. Gomez's last two Globe nominations were in the same category for \"Only Murders.\" Her co-stars, Steve Martin and Martin Short, have received equivalent nods in the best actor category each year since the show became eligible for consideration at the awards ceremony.",
      "For best supporting actress, Gomez was nominated for \"Emilia P\u00e9rez,\" the Spanish-language musical thriller from French director Jacques Audiard about a Mexican cartel boss undergoing gender-affirming surgery. Gomez co-starred in the film alongside Zoe Salda\u00f1a, whose performance also earned a Golden Globe nomination for best supporting actress in a motion picture.",
      "Gomez praised Salda\u00f1a in a social media post reacting to the nominations.",
      "\"I don't even know what to write.. I'm so proud of @zoesaldana and I am so grateful and honored @goldenglobes,\" she wrote in a video caption  on her Instagram Stories, which captured the moment Gomez heard her name in the category for best supporting actress in a movie.",
      "\"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" led Monday's Golden Globes nominations with 10 nods in total, across multiple acting categories in addition to directing, screenwriting and music. (Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, who plays the titular character, was also nominated.) \"Only Murders\" is also a top competitor, with four nods tying the show in second place among TV contenders. It is tied with \"Sh\u014dgun\" and second only to \"The Bear.\"",
      "Gomez called out Gasc\u00f3n in another Instagram post, along with the French composers Cl\u00e9ment Ducol and Camille, who worked on \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" and received Golden Globe nominations for best original song and score.",
      "\"@karsiagascon mi amor I am so proud and grateful to know you!\" Gomez wrote, before congratulating Audiard, Ducol and Camille.",
      "Nominating an actor in two categories for their work in multiple projects at one awards show is uncommon, but it has happened at the Golden Globes before. Over the last decade, Amy Adams, Regina King and Alicia Vikander are just some of the celebrities who have competed in dual Globes races during a single year. Among the pool of 2025 nominees, Gomez and Sebastian Stan were the only actors recognized in multiple acting categories for multiple roles.",
      "Stan, of \"Pam & Tommy\" fame, was nominated in the best actor categories for musical or comedy film as well as drama. He received the nods for his lead roles in the dark comedy \"A Different Man\" and the controversial biopic \"The Apprentice,\" where he portrayed a young Donald Trump.",

    "summary": "Dionne Warwick, Smokey Robinson and Melba Moore discuss the history of the Harlem landmark \"where stars are born and legends are made.\"",
    "story": [
      "On Wednesday nights, the Apollo Theater in Harlem is one of the hottest tickets in town. But there's no celebrity headliner. It's Amateur Night! And the audience is there to pick the NEXT breakout star.",
      "\"I know how tough the crowd can be,\" said Kyle Parks, a 23-year-old singer from Yonkers, New York. \"I know that's what makes this place legendary, what goes into it.\"",
      "Parks won the crowd over with his performance of \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" by Sam Cooke. Others ... weren't so lucky. Marion Caffey, longtime producer of the Apollo's iconic Amateur Night, said, \"They're brutally honest. And just sometimes just brutal, not necessarily honest!\"",
      "Caffey says it's the longest-running singing competition in history. \"Well, 'The Voice,' and 'America's Got Talent,' and 'American Idol,' and 'Star Search,' we are the great-grandfather of all of that,\" he said. \"This was the blueprint.\"",
      "The theater's motto is \"Where stars are born and legends are made\"\u2026 and it's launched plenty of them, from James Brown and Ella Fitzgerald, to Stevie Wonder, Lauryn Hill and H.E.R.",
      "And if you're wondering why every performer rubs that tree stump, according to Caffey, \"This stump used to be a full tree. And it stood outside the Lafayette Theater. And they would pull leaves from the tree for good luck. And now everyone comes here and rubs the Tree of Hope for good luck.\"",
      "Does it work? \"Well, I think it's good luck if you win, and it's not such good luck if you lose,\" Caffey said.",
      "But it worked for the award-winning singer Dionne Warwick, whose career skyrocketed since she and her gospel group won Amateur Night back in 1958.",
      "What did winning prove to her? \"Well, that we were good enough, first of all,\" Warwick said. \"And that we won $50!\"",
      "Warwick said going to the 1,500-seat theater was like going to school and getting a crash course in performing: \"The old saying is true, it is so true: 'If you can make it at the Apollo, you can make it anywhere.' They brought out the very best in you. Every single time I played the Apollo, it got better and better and better. And I mean, I felt like I was at home.\"",
      "But it wasn't always welcoming. Before it was the Apollo, it was a whites-only burlesque theater. In 1934, under new ownership and a new name, it opened its doors to everyone. Music historian Guthrie Ramsey said, \"It was one of the first to allow Black and white patrons to enjoy the music together. After all, it's New York City, and the Black community was growing. And so, it was basically a business model decision to allow Black citizens in.\"",
      "Ramsey says the story of the Apollo and the story of America are intertwined. \"It was a representative of anything that was going on in America, you could see the Apollo Theater reflecting that,\" he said. \"It's all of our histories. We all have a stake in it.\"",
      "During the civil rights movement, the Apollo became more than just a performance space. Motown great Smokey Robinson said, \"Sittin' in and marching and doing all this, and going to restaurants and they don't wanna serve us, and all that, we couldn't stay in any hotels \u2013 it was a rough time, you know?\"",
      "But the Apollo was like a beacon. \"It was the beacon,\" Robinson said. \"It was the Black music staple. It was just, you know, where the Black acts came. Couldn't play nowhere else!\"",
      "Robinson says the first time he and The Miracles performed here, he was a nervous wreck. They bombed! \u00a0\"I was frightened to death to be at the Apollo Theater,\" he said. \"Had we not had a record out and supposedly be 'professional' at that point, that the guy with the hook would have came and took us off the stage, because we were terrible!\" he laughed. \"We were just amateurs, we were so terrible, until Mr. Schiffman, the guy who owned the Apollo at that time, called Berry Gordy, who was our manager and stuff at that point, and told him he wanted his money back!\"",
      "In the decades that followed, as more places became integrated, the Apollo struggled financially, and closed its doors more than once. \"We could've lost the Apollo, but we're still here,\" said actress and singer Melba Moore. She says she grew up watching shows at the theater, and then got a chance to perform here \u2013 and later became a guest host on \"It's Showtime at the Apollo,\" the TV version of Amateur Night.",
      "Moore says this theater is something to be treasured.",
      "Tonight, the Apollo Theater is being awarded a prestigious Kennedy Center Honor at a ceremony that we'll see later this month on CBS.",
      "Michelle Ebanks, president and CEO of the theater, says it's the first time an institution (rather than a person) has received such recognition. \"The idea of the Apollo opened up this whole universe, so that everyone could see this is American culture, too,\" Ebanks said. \"This is the magic of art, the power of art.\"",
      "This is also the year the theater begins its 90th season. And to Smokey Robinson, the Apollo is still a force to be reckoned with. \"You know, it's the beginning. It's the proving ground. It's the Apollo!\"",

    "summary": "The internationally acclaimed Netflix series \u2013 a dystopian parable about capitalism and greed \u2013 is now releasing Season 2. Hwang Dong-hyuk says the lethal competition, played with childish games, is \"getting darker, episode by episode.\"",
    "story": [
      "\"Squid Game\" fans know that trumpet wakeup call means someone is going to die. Not our hero, Gi-hun, but one or more of the players hoping to win a fortune competing in childish, but lethal, games. It's at once a thriller and a critique of inequality and greed.",
      "Season 1 was an international blockbuster. With 330 million views, it's Netflix's most-watched series of all time. It won Emmys for its lead actor, Lee Jung-jae, and creator Hwang Dong-hyuk. Both made history as the first Asian winners in their categories.",
      "We first spoke with Hwang in Korea just as he was about to start a global promotional tour for Season 2.",
      "\"So, you are kind of in a sweet spot now?\" I asked.",
      "\"I don't know what you mean by 'sweet spot,'\" Hwang replied.",
      "\"Just that things are going your way?\"",
      "\"But it's not easy. Nothing's easy,\" he said. \"People keep saying to me, 'You are the happiest person in Korea.' But in my mind, I am not that happy. I'm struggling every day and night.\"",
      "That's thanks to a brutal workload: Hwang directed and wrote every episode. Sworn to secrecy, \"Sunday Morning\" was invited to a soundstage outside Seoul where much of Season 2 was shot.",
      "Hwang was at the top of his game, but it wasn't always that way. He was only five when his father died. After that, he says, his family was trapped in poverty. As a struggling filmmaker, and in debt, Hwang said he sought escape in comic books. \"I read a lot in the survival game genre and gambling genre,\" he said. \"And that led me to think, what if I were to combine childhood games with people putting their lives at stake for a huge cash prize? And that was really how the idea was conceived.\"",
      "And a blockbuster was born.",
      "In the show, contestants driven by desperation risk everything for money, exploited by a sinister game master, the powerful Front Man.",
      "Asked if \"Squid Game\" represents how he sees capitalists and capitalism in general - a group of desperate people manipulated by a cruel and wealthy elite - Hwang replied, \"I think fundamentally what continues to drive this system is human selfishness and greed. These days I'm becoming more pessimistic about human nature. I almost think that, for homo sapiens, it's greed that allows them to create a society that they feel most comfortable in.\"",
      "Many of the characters in Season 2 are new (Hwang having killed off so many of them in Season 1), but the guards are back, and so is Gi-hun, now on a doomed mission to stop the game.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Squid Game: Season 2\" click on the video player below:",
      "Hwang said that \"Squid Game\" Seasons 2 and 3 \"will show people the bottom of this world, the bottom of the human being.\"",
      "So, it gets even darker? \"Yeah, it's getting darker, episode by episode,\" Hwang said.",
      "The show is so popular that recently 50,000 people applied for a chance to take part in a real-life (but non-deadly) Squid Game in Paris. The prize: an early look at the new season.",
      "Hwang is amazed, especially by his show's wild success in the U.S., where audiences have not traditionally gone for a subtitled TV series: \"I was always hoping to make something very popular in the States, so I was surprised,\" he said. \"At the same time there was, like, in my dream come true. But that level of success [was] just beyond my expectations.\"",
      "Ironically, this creator of a dystopian parable about desperation and poverty now finds himself a wealthy man \u2013 one of the great winners of capitalism. Has that changed him? \"Not much,\" he said. \"Made my life better, for sure, because I don't have to worry about [making] money anymore. But since then, I don't think I was changed a lot by more success or more money, because it's just a number. It doesn't have any meaning to me at all.\"",
      "What does have meaning is his work. But the success and the pressure of \"Squid Game\" have taken a toll: \"It's more than, like, five years I've been just working on this one project, day and night. I'm so exhausted. I'm so sick of, you know?\" he laughed. \"I need a break, I need a break.\"",
      "A break from non-stop work \u2026 and from his deep dive into the dark depths of human nature.",
      "So, what makes Hwang Dong-hyuk laugh? \"My friends! I love talking to my friends and having a beer.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 08 Dec 2024 10:08:24 -0500",
    "summary": "With her album, \"Hit Me Hard and Soft,\" and her current tour (her first without brother Finneas), Billie Eilish is discovering parts of herself she didn't know were there \u2013 from finding a new voice as a songwriter, to stretching her singing after starting vocal lessons.",
    "story": [
      "At the open of a Billie Eilish concert, a giant light box rises in the arena. \"Spoiler alert! I'm in the cube, but you can't see me,\" she said. \"I can literally see everybody so well from inside this box, but they have no idea I can see them. It feels like I'm wearing an invisibility cloak.\"",
      "\"That's a luxury you don't have most of the time,\" I said.",
      "\"That's true!\" she laughed. \"But it also makes me feel a little like I'm not real?\"",
      "Her whole career has been kind of unreal. Eilish, who turns 23 this month, has more than 100 million followers on Spotify, an ardent fan base that filled the United Center in Chicago.",
      "A few hours before showtime, Eilish was scurrying around backstage, introducing us to her backup singers \u2026 her band \u2026 and taking us to a room full of rescue dogs, who offer stress relief. \"Welcome to the puppy room!\" she said. A couple have already been adopted.",
      "She's filled her crew with friends (even the furry kind) because this tour is different. Since Eilish broke out at 14, her older brother, Finneas, has been her producer, songwriting partner and backing band. For the first time, she's on tour without him. \"I've never done a show without my brother in my life,\" she said. \"I mean, I've barely performed and sung without my brother, like, ever.\"",
      "But they agreed it was time for her to go out on her own. Finneas told us, \"I was built into the show for several years in an irreplaceable way. And I always kind of was trying to make myself replaceable.\"",
      "Her mom, Maggie Baird, came to the Chicago show. But Eilish's parents also aren't touring with her anymore. \"It does feel strange, yeah,\" Baird said. \"But it also feels okay. And there's also a lot of jobs I used to do where I'm like, I'm happy I don't have to do that one anymore!\"",
      "\"Honestly, she won't admit it, but I think it's been really nice for her that I've been gone,\" Billie laughed. \"And that then she can come see me and it's not just, like, her whole life. I mean, I've been her whole life for, like, 23 years now.\"",
      "\"Pretty good life, though,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah, a lot! But, yeah\u2026\"",
      "Earlier this year, Eilish won her second Oscar for the \"Barbie\" theme, \"What Was I Made For.\" She already has nine Grammys, and now another seven nominations. Among her nominations are record of the year and song of the year, for a song (\"Birds of a Feather\") that she almost didn't put on her album.",
      "Billie and Finneas had struggled with the song. \"We wrote, like, the first half and it was super-good,\" she said. \"And then we overthought it for, like, months and months and months.\"",
      "I asked, \"When you sing it, do you hear all that you went through to create it?\"",
      "\"Sometimes,\" she replied. \"Sometimes when I listen to it, I hear certain parts that I'm like, 'Oh, that was such a nightmare! That was so punishing!'\"",
      "Watch Billie Eilish perform \"Birds of a Feather\":",
      "Eilish admits that, until recently, she didn't think of herself so much as a songwriter. That has changed. \"I did, like, way more writing on this album than anything ever,\" she said. \"But this is the thing I'm trying to say: I've been writing music since I was 11. But because I wasn't as fast at it, or wasn't as good, as my brother, I kind of thought, 'Oh, I'm not a songwriter.'\"",
      "But when they sat down to write Billie's third album, \"Hit Me Hard and Soft,\" Finneas felt uninspired.",
      "\"We'd get in the studio to write and I'd be, like, 'Can we go play pickleball?'\" he said. \"I think I just sort of had a little fatigue there.\"",
      "Billie said they were in \"different places,\" and that she felt alone. In the past, Finneas would help pull a lyric out of his sister. This time, she had to coax the words out of herself. \"And then, in just being given that space, I'd come up with it,\" she said.",
      "On the last chorus of \"Birds of a Feather,\" Eilish reached for a note she wasn't sure she could hit.\u00a0 Her vocal bravery came after she started taking singing lessons.",
      "I asked, \"Have you found some part of yourself you didn't even know was there?\"",
      "\"Yeah! Oh, yeah. I mean, my voice!\" she laughed. \"I can't express how gratifying, and satisfying, and fulfilling it has been to, like, learn these things about my own voice \u2013 that's in my body \u2013 that I didn't even know I was capable of. \u2026 It's so liberating.\"",
      "Hear Billie Eilish's isolated vocal track for \"Birds of a Feather\":",
      "For all we may think we know about Billie Eilish, the singer is just beginning to know herself.",
      "I asked, \"What's interesting to me is, you're talking now about two things: one is, you've discovered a part of your voice you didn't even know was there; and you've discovered you're more of a songwriter than you ever thought. Where does that leave you?\"",
      "\"Great question,\" Eilish said. \"We'll see. I don't know!\"",

      "Nineteen cases are confirmed, with 17 hospitalized, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in its latest update. States with confirmed illnesses include: California, Georgia, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oregon and Tennessee.",
      "Seven of the illnesses are related to pregnancy, the CDC stated.",
      "In California, a mother and her twins were sick and both infants died, but because listeria was found only in a sample from the mother and one twin, only the mother and one twin are included in the confirmed cases in the outbreak.",

      "Sick people's samples were collected from Oct. 24, 2021, to Oct. 28, 2024, the agency said.",
      "The outbreak might be higher than reported, the CDC said, because people who have gotten sick may not have gotten tested for listeria. It takes 3 to 4 weeks to determine if someone was part of an outbreak.",
      "Listeria can be especially harmful to pregnant people, people age 65 or older, and those with weakened immune systems.",

    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 10:25:22 -0500",
    "summary": "Consumers are venting frustrations about health insurance in wake of UnitedHealthcare CEO murder. Costs have outpaced inflation for years.",
    "story": [
      "Health insurance costs are far outpacing inflation, leaving more consumers on the hook each year for thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket expenses. At the same time, some insurers are rejecting nearly 1 in 5 claims. That double whammy is leaving Americans paying more for coverage yet sometimes feeling like they're getting less in return, experts say.",
      "Frustration over denials and medical costs has fueled an outpouring of vitriol against health insurance companies in the wake of the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Also last week, a similar outcry led Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield to reverse a\u00a0decision\u00a0to limit anesthesia coverage during surgeries.",
      "The anger may be rooted in fears that unexpected medical costs could prove financially ruinous, as well as concerns that essential care could be denied by an insurer, putting health and well-being at risk even for those who have health insurance.",
      "Some of those anxieties are well-founded: The top\u00a0cause of bankruptcy in the U.S. is health care-related debt, underscoring the financial stresses that can stem from high medical costs.",
      "In fact, most adults say they worry about their ability to pay for health care services or unexpected medical bills, a sentiment shared by people regardless of whether they're financially comfortable or struggling, a KFF survey found earlier this year.",
      "In 2024, the average health insurance premium for families carried a price tag of $25,572 per year, while single workers paid an average of $8,951, representing a 6% and 7% increase from the year earlier, KFF data shows. Since 2000, the rise in health insurance premiums has outpaced inflation for all but a handful of years, the health policy research firm found.",
      "\"Unhappiness with insurers stems from two things: 'I'm sick and I'm getting hassled,' and the second is very much cost \u2014 'I'm paying more than I used to, and I'm paying more than my wages went up',\" said Rob Andrews, CEO of the Health Transformation Alliance, a cooperative representing major companies such as American Express and Coca-Cola that works on improving health insurance for their employees. \"A lot of people think they are getting less\" from their insurers, Andrews said.",
      "And while Americans have unhappily encountered other types of inflation in recent years \u2014\u00a0sky-high grocery prices\u00a0have been credited with helping President-elect Donald Trump claim victory last month \u2014 health insurance can take on an even more personal edge, Thomas pointed out.",
      "\"It's not like, 'How much do I have to pay for a lawn chair or a steak,'\" Andrews noted. \"People are sick or having some sort of health problem they are worried about.\"",
      "To be sure, people with employer-sponsored health insurance typically don't pay the full premium, as their employers pick up much of the tab.",
      "Yet KFF data shows that employees' share of their premiums are also on the rise, with a worker with family coverage typically paying premiums of $5,700 per year in 2017, the most recent year for that data, up from about $1,600 in 2000, KFF data shows. The average family deductible \u2014 the amount paid out-of-pocket before insurance kicks in \u2014 has increased from $2,500 in 2013 to $3,700 in 2023, according to KFF.",
      "About 81% of Americans last year said they were dissatisfied with the cost of health care in the U.S, a 16-year high, Gallup polling found.",
      "\"We've gotten to a point where health care is so inaccessible and unaffordable, people are justified in their frustrations,\" Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, told CBS Mornings on Friday.",
      "Health insurance denials",
      "Aside from rising health insurance costs, Americans are also expressing anger at coverage denials, which a KFF analysis of nongroup qualified health plans in 2021 found impacted almost 1 in 5 claims. However, their study found denial rates varied considerably by insurer, with some as low as 2% while others were as high as 49%.",
      "\"When you are paying for something, and then they don't give it to you and they keep raising prices, of course you will be frustrated by that,\" noted Holden Karau, a software engineer who created a free service called\u00a0Fight Health Insurance to help people appeal their denials.",
      "Karau says she came up with the app, which uses AI to craft appeal letters, after her own and her dog's experience with insurance. Her pet insurer initially refused to pay for anesthesia for her dog's root canal, while Karau, who is transgender, said she dealt with many appeals to get her own procedures and surgeries covered by her insurance.",
      "More insurance companies are using AI to review claims and issue denials, which isn't always obvious to consumers. The shift to AI-based reviews has sparked lawsuits against insurers, with UnitedHealthcare sued last year by the families of two now-deceased customers who alleged the insurer knowingly used a faulty algorithm to deny elderly patients coverage for extended care deemed necessary by their doctors.",
      "\"With AI tools on the insurance side, they have very little negative consequences for denying procedures,\" Karau added. \"We are seeing really high denial rates triggered by AI. And on the patient and provider side, they don't have the tools to fight back.\"",
      "Most people may not be aware that they have the right to appeal a denial, Karau noted. The majority of people who are hit with a denial or billing errors don't contest, a study found earlier this year. For those that do, a first appeal will be dealt with by the insurer, but if that in-house appeal is also denied, you have the right to ask for an independent reviewer to look at your claim, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.",
      "\"There are multiple levels of appeal, and in my experience, I would say it's important to appeal until you at least get to an independent reviewer,\" Karau said. \"If you don't appeal, you won't get the care you need.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 17:05:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Even those enrolled in Medicare have a harder time paying for treatment compared with older adults in other countries.",
    "story": [
      "In the U.S., having health insurance is necessary, but not sufficient to ensure access to affordable medical care.",
      "While the U.S. lacks a universal health care system like those that exist in most other wealthy nations, most Americans over 65 are insured through Medicare. Yet many still struggle to afford care, with high out-of-pocket costs putting necessary medications and doctor visits out of reach, according to\u00a0research from The Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit that works to promote an equitable health care system.",
      "These extra costs, for which Medicare beneficiaries are on the hook, make it harder for older Americans to access affordable care relative to their peers in nine other countries, the group found. Researchers compared coverage for older adults in the U.S. to health care systems in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.",
      "Nearly one in four older adults in the U.S. spent at least $2,000 in out-of-pocket expenses last year, compared to less than 5% of older adults in France and the Netherlands who spent that much, The Commonwealth Fund found. Only in Switzerland did older adults report spending more on health care than those in the U.S.",
      "\"The reason to focus on this population is because in the U.S. nearly every adult over 65 has Medicare,\" Munira Z. Gunja, senior researcher for international health policy and practice innovations at The Commonwealth Fund told CBS MoneyWatch. While the U.S. stands out as \"the only high-income country without a universal health system,\" when it comes to the over-65 population, \"at least, we are on par with other countries,\" she said.",
      "Does Medicare fall short?",
      "But the study suggests that the kind of coverage Medicare plans provide isn't meeting many Americans' needs. Eight percent of older adults in the U.S., more than any other wealthy country except Austria, reported delaying or forgoing medical care because of costs. And there are repercussions to not getting the care one needs: One-third of older U.S. adults who said they faced cost-related barriers to accessing care reported being either in fair or poor health.",
      "\"We find that while nearly every older adult has Medicare coverage, it is still more expensive than what older adults in other nations face, and because of that, older adults in the U.S. are more likely to skip care,\" Gunja said. \"When they need prescription drugs, they are more likely to skip getting those too.\"",
      "Oftentimes, for example, Medicare Advantage members find themselves seeing out-of-network doctors, which exposes them to \"a ton of health care costs,\" according to Gunja.",
      "One exception",
      "There's one area in which Medicare beneficiaries faced few out-of-pocket costs and, as a result, were less likely to skip care \u2014 mental health treatment. Less than 5% of residents in all nations skipped mental health care over affordability concerns. The stat illustrates that when treatment is affordable, patients are more inclined to seek out the care they need, according to Gunja.",
      "\"It's a benefit that's offered on all health plans, and we see what happens when people don't need to spend as much on a service,\" she said.",
      "Solutions?",
      "When older people skip or delay care, their health can worsen, leading to sicker patients, who tend to require more costly care. That in turn drives up federal Medicare spending, according to The Commonwealth Fund.",
      "Gunja suggests that the U.S. can look to other countries for solutions that make health care more affordable for older adults. Some examples include capping out-of-pocket expenses and fully covering hospital and physician services.",
      "\"Across the board, the U.S. generally comes out last for most measures when it comes to affordability measures,\" Gunja said. \"Getting health insurance is absolutely necessary. But it's only the first step. We need to make sure coverage is not just comprehensive, but also affordable.\"",

    "story": [
      "Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield said Thursday that the health insurance provider is reversing a policy that was set to go into effect in February that would have limited anesthesia coverage during surgeries and other procedures, a change that had prompted an outcry from some physicians and lawmakers.",
      "The policy, which would have covered Anthem's plans in Connecticut, New York and Missouri, was disclosed in recent weeks, with the company's New York unit posting a\u00a0notice on Dec. 1. The policy would have excluded people under 22 years old and maternity care.",
      "According to the original policy statement, Anthem had said it would pay only for anesthesia treatments for the length of time that a procedure or surgery is estimated to require based on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service's physician work time values. The insurer noted that claims for anesthesia \"above the established number of minutes will be denied.\"",
      "In an email to CBS News on Thursday, Anthem said it was backing away from the policy, and added there had been \"widespread misinformation about an update to our anesthesia policy.\"",
      "\"As a result, we have decided to not proceed with this policy change,\" an Anthem spokesperson wrote in an email. \"To be clear, it never was and never will be the policy of Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield to not pay for medically necessary anesthesia services. The proposed update to the policy was only designed to clarify the appropriateness of anesthesia consistent with well-established clinical guidelines.\"",
      "Before the announcement of Anthem's reversal, the plan had drawn criticism from medical professionals as well as Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat, who wrote on social media on Wednesday that the plan is \"appalling.\"",
      "\"Saddling patients with thousands of dollars in surprise additional medical debt.   And for what? Just to boost corporate profits?\" Murphy wrote. \"Reverse this decision immediately.\"",
      "Connecticut Comptroller Sean Scanlon told the Hartford Courant Thursday that the policy would not take place in his state after negotiating with the insurer.",
      "\"After hearing from people across the state about this concerning policy, my office reached out to Anthem, and I'm pleased to share this policy will no longer be going into effect here in Connecticut,\" Scanlon told the newspaper.",
      "\"Appalling behavior by commercial health insurers\"",
      "In a statement last month, the American Society of Anesthesiologists also called on Anthem to reverse the policy.",
      "\"With this new policy, Anthem will arbitrarily pre-determine the time allowed for anesthesia care during a surgery or procedure,\" the group said. \"If an anesthesiologist submits a bill where the actual time of care is longer than Anthem's limit, Anthem will deny payment for the anesthesiologist's care.\"",
      "The insurer's new policy could result in denials of coverage to patients who might need more anesthesia because their surgery is difficult or unusual, or if a complication occurs, the group added.",
      "\"This is just the latest in a long line of appalling behavior by commercial health insurers looking to drive their profits up at the expense of patients and physicians providing essential care,\" said Donald E. Arnold, an anesthesiologist and president of the American Society of Anesthesiologists. \"This egregious policy breaks the trust between Anthem and its policyholders who expect their health insurer to pay physicians for the entirety of the care they need.\"",

    "summary": "In some U.S. states, more than 40% of residents report having to cut back on basic necessities to afford their electricity bill, survey finds.",
    "story": [
      "With the\u00a0cost of things\u00a0like food and housing still straining people's budgets, many U.S. households over the past year have found themselves having to pare their spending on basic necessities just to keep the lights on at home.",
      "That's according to a recent Lending Tree study which analyzed U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey data from Aug. 20, 2024 to Sep. 16, 2024 to find the percentage of Americans 18 and older that had cut back on necessary expenses to pay their energy bill, kept their home at an unsafe or unhealthy temperature, or was unable to pay the full amount on an energy bill at least once over the preceding 12 months.",
      "The study found that more than 34% of respondents said they have had to cut back or skip spending on certain necessary expenses at least once over the past year in order to pay their energy bill.",
      "\"Even though inflation has moderated in recent months, life is still crazy-expensive, and that can make it hard to pay your bills,\" Matt Schulz, LendingTree chief credit analyst, said in the report. \"Lots of people have found themselves needing to make difficult decisions to keep the lights on. For some, that might mean cutting back on some expenses. For others, it might mean getting a side hustle or a second job.\"",

      "Hotter temperatures mean higher utility costs for millions of Americans",
      "Not surprisingly, households in poorer states are having a harder time keeping up with their electricity bill. In Alabama and Mississippi, more than 44% of residents reported having to make sacrifices to pay their utility bill, according to LendingTree. Eight of the top 11 states with the highest percentage of people struggling to pay energy bills are in the South, according to the report.",
      "\"Southern states tend to be low-income states, which means that each month can be a struggle,\" Schulz said. \"Add in that these are also low credit score states, and the predicament gets tougher.\"",
      "Adding to people's struggle is the rising cost of utilities. On average, in August Americans spent an average of $185.59 on electricity bills, according to LendingTree, a 2.6% increase from $180.82 in the same month a year ago. That said, residents in states with the highest energy rates don't necessarily pay the highest average monthly bills, according to the report, which found notable disparities in energy usage.",
      "For instance, Arizona, which has an average electricity rate of 42.10 cents per kilowatt-hour, or 14.7% below the national average of 16.63 cents, still has the second highest average monthly bill at $254.47, according to the report. Connecticut, which only has the third-highest electricity rate at 29.93 cents, or 109.7% above the national average, has the highest average monthly bill in the country, $254.47.",
      "Schulz expects both power costs and usage to continue increasing.",
      "\"For one, climate change and the\u00a0extreme weather that can come along with it may lead to greater usage, both in the heat of summer and the cold of winter,\" he said. \"Also, many utility companies are seeking to raise their rates in response to growing demand and other issues, and they're getting their way in many cases. It all adds up to some challenges for people with tight budgets.\"",

That's helped lower the inflation rate to its current level from a recent peak of 9.1% in June 2022, yet the last leg of the Fed's journey to push inflation down to a 2% annual rate is proving elusive.",
      "\"This is the second month in a row that the year-over-year change in the Consumer Price Index has increased. Prices rose by 0.3% between October and November,\" noted Bright MLS chief economist Lisa Sturtevant in an email after the report was released.",
      "She added, \"Since May 2023, wages have been rising faster than inflation, which is the main reason why persistently higher inflation has not slowed overall consumer spending.\"",
      "But the impact of high consumer prices is pinching many families, she added. \"Recent research from the U.S. Census Bureau has shown that moderate-income families are experiencing the strain of inflation much more than higher-income households,\" Sturtevant added.",
      "Problem areas: Shelter and grocery prices",
      "Pinch points for consumers last month were shelter prices \u2014 rent and housing costs \u2014 as well as food, according to the CPI data. Housing prices have proved particularly sticky since the pandemic, with home prices, rents and mortgage rates all rising significantly in recent years.",

      "Food prices also rose last month, with groceries increasing 0.5% on a month-over-month basis, the BLS said.",
      "\"Shelter costs continue to be the number one source for higher prices, and that the rate of increase has slowed is no comfort,\" said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union, in an email. \"Many food prices rose, including the proxy for that category, eggs, up about 8% for the month.\"",
      "He added, \"This report may show a mild increase in the grand scheme, and should guarantee another rate cut when the Fed meets next week, but especially for lower-income Americans it's adding to the harsh burden of high costs.\"",
      "Fed's December rate meeting",

    "summary": "The judge criticized the auction process as flawed and said the outcome \"left a lot of money on the table\" for Sandy Hook families.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Tuesday night rejected the sale of the conspiracy platform Infowars to The Onion satirical news outlet after Alex Jones claimed that a recent bankruptcy auction was fraught with illegal collusion.",
      "The Onion was named the winning bidder on Nov. 14 over a company affiliated with Jones. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez's decision means Jones can stay at Infowars in Austin, Texas. The Onion had planned to kick Jones out and relaunch Infowars in January as a parody.",
      "At the end of a lengthy two-day hearing in a Texas courtroom, Lopez criticized the auction process as flawed and said the outcome \"left a lot of money on the table\" for families of victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.",
      "\"You got to scratch and claw and get everything you can for them,\" Lopez said.",
      "The Onion offered $1.75 million in cash and other incentives for Infowars' assets in the auction. First United American Companies, which runs a website in Jones' name that sells nutritional supplements, bid $3.5 million.",
      "Lopez cited problems \u2014 but no wrongdoing \u2014 with the auction process. He said he did not want another auction and left it up to the trustee who oversaw the auction to determine the next steps.",
      "Trustee Christopher Murray had defended The Onion's bid during the hearing.",
      "\"Only two people showed up to bid and\u2026one was just better than the other,\" Murray testified, referring to The Onion. Asked how much better it was, he said \"by a lot.\"",
      "Although The Onion's cash offer was lower than that of First United American, it also included a pledge by many of the Sandy Hook families to forgo $750,000 of the auction proceeds due to them and give it to other creditors, providing the other creditors more money than they would receive under First United American's bid.",
      "Jones did not attend the proceedings and instead broadcast from his studios in Austin.",
      "\"I can't imagine the judge would certify this fraud,\" Jones said on his show Tuesday. \"I mean it's head-spinning the stuff they did and what they claimed.\"",
      "The trustee and The Onion deny the allegations from Jones and the company and accuse them of sour grapes.",
      "CBS News has reached to The Onion and representatives of Jones for comment on the ruling.",
      "The sale of Infowars is part of Jones' personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022 after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas filed by relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.",
      "Jones repeatedly called the shooting that killed 20 children and six educators a hoax staged by actors and aimed at increasing gun control. Parents and children of many of the victims testified in court that they were traumatized by Jones' conspiracies and threats from his followers.",
      "Jones has since acknowledged that the Connecticut school shooting happened.",
      "Most of the proceeds from the sale of Infowars, as well as many of Jones' personal assets, will go to the Sandy Hook families. Some proceeds will go to Jones' other creditors.",
      "Murray testified that he did not favor either bidder over the other and was not biased.",
      "He also revealed that First United American submitted a revised bid in recent days, but he said he could not accept it because the Sandy Hook families in the Connecticut lawsuit objected.",
      "The Onion valued its bid, with the Sandy Hook families' offer, at $7 million because that amount was equal to a purchase price that would provide the same amount of money to the other creditors.",
      "In a court filing last month, Murray's lawyers called First United American's request to disqualify The Onion's bid a \"disappointed bidder's improper attempt to influence an otherwise fair and open election process.\"",
      "Murray's lawyer questioned him Tuesday afternoon, then Jones' attorney, Ben Broocks, cross-examined him into the early evening.",
      "Broocks noted that the Sandy Hook lawsuit judgments could be overturned in pending appeals and got Murray to acknowledge that the Sandy Hook families' offer in The Onion bid could fall apart if that happens. That's because the percentage of the auction proceeds they would be entitled to could drop sharply and they wouldn't get the $750,000 from the sale to give to other creditors.",
      "Broocks also questioned Murray about last-minute changes to the proposed sale to The Onion, with Murray responding that they were the result of different viewpoints on the numbers being settled.",
      "Auctioneer Jeff Tanenbaum on Monday defended both the value of the bid and its selection.",
      "Up for sale were all the equipment and other assets in the Infowars studio in Austin, as well as the rights to its social media accounts, websites, video archive and product trademarks. Jones uses the studio to broadcast his far-right, conspiracy theory-filled shows on the Infowars website, his account on the social platform X and radio stations. Many of Jones' personal assets also are being sold.",
      "Jones has set up another studio, websites and social media accounts in case The Onion wins approval to buy Infowars and kicks him out. Jones has said he could continue using the Infowars platforms if the auction winner is friendly to him.",
      "Jones is appealing the $1.5 billion in judgments citing free speech rights.",
      "After being named the winning bidder last month, The Onion CEO Bell Collins briefly described its plans for Infowars in a statement to social media.",
      "\"We are planning on making it a very funny, very stupid website. We have retained the services of some Onion and Clickhole Hall of Famers to pull this off. I can't wait to show you what we have cooked up,\" he wrote.",
      "The Onion said its \"exclusive launch advertiser\" would be the gun violence prevention organization Everytown for Gun Safety.",
      "In a satirical\u00a0article\u00a0posted to The Onion, the supposed CEO of Global Tetrahedron, the parent company of The Onion, said \"the decision to acquire InfoWars was an easy one for the Global Tetrahedron executive board.\"",
      "\"Founded in 1999 on the heels of the Satanic 'panic' and growing steadily ever since, InfoWars has distinguished itself as an invaluable tool for brainwashing and controlling the masses,\" fake Global Tetrahedron CEO Bryce P. Tetraeder wrote. \"No price would be too high for such a cornucopia of malleable assets and minds.\"",

      "\"Andrew has a proven record of standing up to Big Tech censorship, and protecting Freedom of Speech in our Great Country,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social, adding, \"Andrew will be the most America First, and pro-innovation FTC Chair in our Country's History.\"",
      "Fertitta, meanwhile, the billionaire CEO of hospitality group Landry's, Inc., is Trump's pick for U.S. ambassador to Italy, people familiar with the decision told CBS News Tuesday. Trump transition officials declined to comment.",
      "Fertitta is a friend of Trump's and longtime GOP donor who leads Landry's Inc., a Texas-based corporation with hotels, restaurants and casinos. He starred in a reality TV show on CNBC called \"Billion Dollar Buyer\" and owns more than 600 properties in 36 states and in over 15 countries, according the company's website, including the iconic Golden Nugget Casino, Morton's The Steakhouse, the Palm Restaurant and Joe's Crab Shack.",

      "Johnson \u2014 not the Republican senator \u2014 served as ambassador to El Salvador during Trump's first administration. His nomination comes as the president-elect has been threatening tariffs on Mexican imports and the mass deportation of migrants who have arrived to the U.S.-Mexico border. Johnson is also a former U.S. Army veteran and was in the Central Intelligence Agency.",
      "Guilfoyle is a former California prosecutor and television news personality who led the fundraising for Trump's 2020 campaign and became engaged to Don Jr. in 2020. Trump called her \"a close friend and ally\" and praised her \"sharp intellect make her supremely qualified.\" Guilfoyle was on stage with the family on election night.",

      "The replacement of Khan at the FTC likely means that the commission will operate with a lighter touch when it comes to antitrust enforcement. The new chair is expected to appoint new directors of the FTC's antitrust and consumer protection divisions.",
      "\"These changes likely will make the FTC more favorable to business than it has been in recent years, though the extent to which is to be determined,\" wrote Anthony DiResta, a consumer protection attorney at Holland & Knight, in a recent analysis.",
      "Deals that were blocked by the Biden administration could find new life with Trump in command.",
      "For example, the new leadership could be more open to a proposed merger between the country's two biggest supermarket chains, Kroger and Albertsons, which forged a $24.6 billion deal to combine in 2022. Two judges halted the merger Tuesday night.",
      "The FTC had filed a lawsuit in federal court earlier this year to block the merger, claiming the deal would eliminate competition, leading to higher prices and lower wages for workers. The two companies say a merger would help them lower prices and compete against bigger rivals like Walmart.",
      "One of the judges said the FTC had shown it was likely to prevail in the administrative hearing.",
      "Yet given the widespread public concern over high grocery prices, the Trump administration may not fully abandon the FTC's efforts to block the deal, some experts have said.",
      "And the FTC may continue to scrutinize Big Tech firms for any anticompetitive behavior. Many Republican politicians have accused firms such as Meta of censoring conservative views, and some officials in Trump's orbit, most notably Vice President-elect JD Vance, have previously expressed support for Khan's scrutiny of Big Tech firms.",

      "\"It's similar to last year. From what we're hearing, wholesalers are holding their prices,\" Jill Sidebottom, a spokesperson for the National Christmas Tree Association, a trade group that advocates for the tree industry, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "For consumers, Christmas trees this holiday season will average around $80 to upwards of $100, compared with $75 in 2023 and in line with the previous year's figures, according to the group.",

      "\"It's more expensive the closer to the city you get,\" she said.",
      "\"The original tight supply goes back to 2008, when there was an oversupply and growers stopped planting as many,\" said Sidebottom, noting that it takes up to a decade to grow a tree. Extreme weather, including a 2021 heat dome, also killed a lot of trees in the Pacific Northwest, she added.",
      "Christmas trees are grown in every U.S. state, with Oregon, North Carolina and Michigan producing the most. Trees are also imported from Canada, with tree types including the Douglas fir imported from British Columbia.",

      "Drought conditions hit parts of the country in recent months, resulting in wildfires in parts of the East Coast and potentially sleepless nights for tree farmers, given roots that were not properly hydrated in the fall may not make it.",
      "\"We were very worried that it would impact the trees for this year. Thankfully we have not seen any issues,\" Angevine-Bergs said. \"We started cutting some trees early just to see, and in November we began realizing this year's trees are not going to be affected -- taller trees have deeper roots.\"",
      "The roughly 8-foot tree now standard for the Christmas holiday typically takes about eight years to grow, with a white pine, for instance, growing quickly and white fir and spruce trees taking longer.",
      "\"There's about a foot of growth a year, so you're sitting on your money a long time,\" Sidebottom said of the investment made by growers as they wait for their seedlings to sprout and flourish into mature trees.",
      "Just like the holiday shopping season, Americans have moved up the timing as to when they purchase Christmas trees. Last year, a third of Americans bought their Christmas trees during the week after Thanksgiving and another 33% made the purchase during the first week of December, according to a poll of 1,499 adults taken in August and September last year.",
      "Another 16% bought their tree in the second week of December; 14% claimed a tree before Thanksgiving; 3% in the third week of December and only 1% on Christmas Eve, the survey found.",

      "In decades past, \"We never sold trees before Thanksgiving,\" said Angevine-Berg of her roughly 50 acre farm, in the family for 156 years and selling Christmas trees since 1960. \"As a child, we were always busy on Christmas Eve, and now you wouldn't necessarily be open.

    "story": [
      "A probate commissioner has ruled against Rupert Murdoch's effort to change his family's trust to give one of his sons control of his media empire and ensure Fox News maintains its conservative editorial slant, according to a sealed document obtained by The New York Times.",
      "In a decision filed on Saturday, a probate commissioner in Nevada concluded that Murdoch, 93, and his son, Lachlan Murdoch, had acted in \"bad faith\" in their endeavor to amend the irrevocable trust, The New York Times\u00a0reported\u00a0on Monday.",
      "The trust divides control of the company equally among four of Rupert Murdoch's children \u2014 Prudence, Elisabeth, Lachlan and James \u2014 after he dies. Lachlan Murdoch has been the head of Fox News and News Corp since late last year, when his father stepped down.",
      "The elder Murdoch has argued that to preserve his businesses' commercial value for all his heirs, the trust must be changed to allow Lachlan Murdoch to maintain Fox News' conservative bent. James and Elisabeth Murdoch are both known to have less-conservative political views than their father or brother, potentially complicating efforts to ensure that Fox News remains conservative.",
      "In his 96-page opinion, Nevada Probate Commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr. of the Second Judicial District Court characterized the plan to change the trust as a \"carefully crafted charade\" to \"permanently cement Lachlan Murdoch's executive roles\" inside the empire \"regardless of the impacts such control would have over the companies or the beneficiaries\" of the family trust.",
      "Adam Streisand, a lawyer for Rupert Murdoch, told the newspaper that his client and his client's son were disappointed with the ruling and intended to appeal.",
      "A spokesperson for Prudence, Elisabeth and James Murdoch said in an emailed statement to The Associated Press that they welcome the ruling and hope that their family can \"move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members.\"",
      "Gorman in his conclusion said: \"The effort was an attempt to stack the deck in Lachlan Murdoch's favor after Rupert Murdoch's passing so that his succession would be immutable. The play might have worked; but an evidentiary hearing, like a showdown in a game of poker, is where gamesmanship collides with the facts and at its conclusion, all the bluffs are called and the cards lie face up.\"",

    "summary": "Consumers are venting frustrations about health insurance in wake of UnitedHealthcare CEO murder. Costs have outpaced inflation for years.",
    "story": [
      "Health insurance costs are far outpacing inflation, leaving more consumers on the hook each year for thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket expenses. At the same time, some insurers are rejecting nearly 1 in 5 claims. That double whammy is leaving Americans paying more for coverage yet sometimes feeling like they're getting less in return, experts say.",
      "Frustration over denials and medical costs has fueled an outpouring of vitriol against health insurance companies in the wake of the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Also last week, a similar outcry led Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield to reverse a\u00a0decision\u00a0to limit anesthesia coverage during surgeries.",
      "The anger may be rooted in fears that unexpected medical costs could prove financially ruinous, as well as concerns that essential care could be denied by an insurer, putting health and well-being at risk even for those who have health insurance.",
      "Some of those anxieties are well-founded: The top\u00a0cause of bankruptcy in the U.S. is health care-related debt, underscoring the financial stresses that can stem from high medical costs.",
      "In fact, most adults say they worry about their ability to pay for health care services or unexpected medical bills, a sentiment shared by people regardless of whether they're financially comfortable or struggling, a KFF survey found earlier this year.",
      "In 2024, the average health insurance premium for families carried a price tag of $25,572 per year, while single workers paid an average of $8,951, representing a 6% and 7% increase from the year earlier, KFF data shows. Since 2000, the rise in health insurance premiums has outpaced inflation for all but a handful of years, the health policy research firm found.",
      "\"Unhappiness with insurers stems from two things: 'I'm sick and I'm getting hassled,' and the second is very much cost \u2014 'I'm paying more than I used to, and I'm paying more than my wages went up',\" said Rob Andrews, CEO of the Health Transformation Alliance, a cooperative representing major companies such as American Express and Coca-Cola that works on improving health insurance for their employees. \"A lot of people think they are getting less\" from their insurers, Andrews said.",
      "And while Americans have unhappily encountered other types of inflation in recent years \u2014\u00a0sky-high grocery prices\u00a0have been credited with helping President-elect Donald Trump claim victory last month \u2014 health insurance can take on an even more personal edge, Thomas pointed out.",
      "\"It's not like, 'How much do I have to pay for a lawn chair or a steak,'\" Andrews noted. \"People are sick or having some sort of health problem they are worried about.\"",
      "To be sure, people with employer-sponsored health insurance typically don't pay the full premium, as their employers pick up much of the tab.",
      "Yet KFF data shows that employees' share of their premiums are also on the rise, with a worker with family coverage typically paying premiums of $5,700 per year in 2017, the most recent year for that data, up from about $1,600 in 2000, KFF data shows. The average family deductible \u2014 the amount paid out-of-pocket before insurance kicks in \u2014 has increased from $2,500 in 2013 to $3,700 in 2023, according to KFF.",
      "About 81% of Americans last year said they were dissatisfied with the cost of health care in the U.S, a 16-year high, Gallup polling found.",
      "\"We've gotten to a point where health care is so inaccessible and unaffordable, people are justified in their frustrations,\" Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, told CBS Mornings on Friday.",
      "Health insurance denials",
      "Aside from rising health insurance costs, Americans are also expressing anger at coverage denials, which a KFF analysis of nongroup qualified health plans in 2021 found impacted almost 1 in 5 claims. However, their study found denial rates varied considerably by insurer, with some as low as 2% while others were as high as 49%.",
      "\"When you are paying for something, and then they don't give it to you and they keep raising prices, of course you will be frustrated by that,\" noted Holden Karau, a software engineer who created a free service called\u00a0Fight Health Insurance to help people appeal their denials.",
      "Karau says she came up with the app, which uses AI to craft appeal letters, after her own and her dog's experience with insurance. Her pet insurer initially refused to pay for anesthesia for her dog's root canal, while Karau, who is transgender, said she dealt with many appeals to get her own procedures and surgeries covered by her insurance.",
      "More insurance companies are using AI to review claims and issue denials, which isn't always obvious to consumers. The shift to AI-based reviews has sparked lawsuits against insurers, with UnitedHealthcare sued last year by the families of two now-deceased customers who alleged the insurer knowingly used a faulty algorithm to deny elderly patients coverage for extended care deemed necessary by their doctors.",
      "\"With AI tools on the insurance side, they have very little negative consequences for denying procedures,\" Karau added. \"We are seeing really high denial rates triggered by AI. And on the patient and provider side, they don't have the tools to fight back.\"",
      "Most people may not be aware that they have the right to appeal a denial, Karau noted. The majority of people who are hit with a denial or billing errors don't contest, a study found earlier this year. For those that do, a first appeal will be dealt with by the insurer, but if that in-house appeal is also denied, you have the right to ask for an independent reviewer to look at your claim, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.",
      "\"There are multiple levels of appeal, and in my experience, I would say it's important to appeal until you at least get to an independent reviewer,\" Karau said. \"If you don't appeal, you won't get the care you need.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 05:45:24 -0500",
    "summary": "The IIHS says a \"small increase in crash speed can really ramp up the danger to a pedestrian,\" and our penchant for big vehicles \"has intensified that effect.\"",
    "story": [
      "Researchers at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety who looked back at data on more than 200 vehicle-pedestrian crashes in the U.S. say Americans' preference for large, tall vehicles is compounding the risks of serious injury to pedestrians associated with higher-speed crashes. The authors of the IIHS study conclude that the size of many American vehicles means serious pedestrian injuries are more likely in crashes when compared to the expected risks on the roads in Europe, where vehicles are generally smaller.",
      "IIHS researchers analyzed 202 crashes involving a vehicle and at least one pedestrian aged 16 or older between 2015 and 2022 in four states, \"to generate an estimate for the link between injury outcomes and impact speed,\" with information about the front-end height of the vehicles being used additionally \"to examine the moderating effect of\" the vehicle's size on the outcome for the pedestrians.",
      "\"A small increase in crash speed can really ramp up the danger to a pedestrian. Our fondness for tall SUVs and pickups in the U.S. has intensified that effect,\" IIHS President David Harkey was quoted as saying about the study's findings.",
      "While it was already understood that more speed at the point of impact increases risks to pedestrians struck by vehicles, the IIHS said the new study was carried out to provide, \"an updated estimate of pedestrian injury risk at different severity levels\" based on the evolving design of vehicles on U.S. roads today.",
      "\"As expected, impact speed strongly predicted injury risk, and hood leading edge height significantly increased the risk of pedestrian injury overall as well as the potency of impact speed for serious injuries,\" the IIHS said.",
      "While the study found no significant change in risk to pedestrians based on the weight of the vehicles involved, the IIHS said that, \"in general, higher vehicle front ends increased the likelihood of both moderate and serious pedestrian injuries.\"",
      "For example, it said that when a median-height pickup, with a front end about 13 inches higher than most cars, hits a pedestrian at 27 mph, there's a 83% chance of moderate injury and a 62% chance of serious injury, compared to 60% and a 30% respectively if the vehicle involved in the crash is a median-height car.",
      "\"Although SUVs are a growing share of the market in Europe, the passenger vehicle fleet there has long been dominated by cars. In contrast, the majority of passenger vehicles on U.S. roads today are SUVs or pickups,\" IIHS senior statistician Sam Monfort, the lead author of the study, was quoted as saying by the institute. \"These choices have very real consequences for pedestrian safety.\"",
      "\"Speed increases have a more pronounced effect when taller vehicles are involved\" in a crash, the organization said. \"For example, as crash speed increases from 15 mph to 35 mph, the risk of a serious injury goes from 9% to 52% when a median-height car is involved. With a median [height] pickup, the risk shoots up from 11% to 91%.\"",
      "Previous research by the IIHS published in 2022 found that drivers of bigger vehicles were more likely to hit pedestrians while making turns than drivers of cars, and another IIHS study published last year that pickups, SUVs and vans with hoods higher than 40 inches at the front edge were about 45% more likely to cause pedestrian fatalities in crashes than cars and other vehicles with lower, sloping hoods.",
      "Despite the concern over the impact of larger vehicles in U.S. pedestrian crashes, however, data showed 2023 saw the first overall year-on-year decline in pedestrian deaths from vehicle accidents in about four years, since the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of pedestrians killed on U.S. roads in 2023 dropped 5.4% compared to the previous year \u2014 which saw a 40-year high \u2014 but it was still 14.1% higher than the number of deaths recorded in 2019, before the pandemic, according to the Governors Highway Safety Association.",

It is the largest ever refund amount in a gaming case, the agency said.",
      "The FTC says it is sending more than 629,000 payments Monday, with more disbursements to come at a later date.

    "published": "Sun, 08 Dec 2024 09:26:29 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump wants to impose across-the-board tariffs on imported goods from both allies and adversaries, claiming it's other nations who will pay such taxes to the U.S. Treasury. But it's American consumers who will be opening their wallets.",
    "story": [
      "Incoming President Donald Trump has made his feelings about tariffs very clear: \"The word 'tariff' is the most beautiful word in the dictionary,\" he has said. \"I think it's more beautiful than 'love.' \u2026 I love tariffs! \u2026 Music to my ears!\"",
      "And what exactly is a tariff? It is a tax. According to Dartmouth economics professor Doug Irwin, \"In U.S. history, we're basically only talking about import tariffs, taxes on imported goods coming into the U.S.\"",
      "Irwin says governments have all kinds of reasons for introducing tariffs: \"Sometimes it's to reduce the trade deficit. Sometimes it's to bring back jobs. Sometimes it's to punish other countries for their unfair trade practices. Sometimes it's to raise revenue so that we can cut income taxes.\"",
      "At its most fundamental, a tariff works like this:",
      "Suppose we import a product from China. The price is $50. But before you can buy it, our government adds $25 to the price. That's the tariff. Your final price is $75. China gets its $50; the extra $25 winds up going to the U.S. Treasury.",
      "But who pays these tariffs?",
      "According to Trump, it's the other countries. \"Trillions and trillions of dollars pouring into the United States Treasury,\" is his description of what happens. \"China paid hundreds of billions of dollars during my term.\"",
      "But as Irwin points out, that's NOT the way tariffs work!",
      "\"I think economists would say that's very misleading to say that that's what's going on,\" he said. \"Of course, it's the U.S. consumers that are paying those, not China itself. China's not writing checks to the U.S. government.\"",
      "Rather, it is a transfer of money from consumers to the federal government. A tax.",
      "Tariffs have been part of international trade since our country was founded; the first one was imposed by George Washington! And what we've learned from history is that they often have unintended consequences.",
      "We have a tariff on sugar that has doubled the price of sugar. It has helped out our sugar cane farmers in Louisiana and Florida, but it's also driven 34% of American chocolate and candy manufacturing (and jobs) out of the country.",

      "More confectionery manufacturers move outside U.S. (Confectionery Production)",
      "Then, there was Trump's 25% tariff on imported steel in 2018. Our steelmakers thrived, but companies that make things out of steel (like Ford, GM and Caterpillar) suffered dearly. Just ask Ford's then-CEO Jim Hackett, who in 2018 told Bloomberg, \"The metals tariffs took about a billion dollars of profit from us. If it goes on longer, there will be more damage.\"",
      "Tariffs against one particular country can backfire. Irwin said, \"With the China tariffs, we're importing a lot more from Vietnam, we're importing a lot more from Malaysia. If the idea with the tariff was to bring jobs back home, instead we're just shifting them from China to Vietnam, in some sense.\"",
      "And P.S.: Tariffs don't just raise prices on the imported stuff; they can affect the price of domestic substitutes as well.",
      "So, if there's a tariff on imported steel, and I'm an American steelmaker, I can opportunistically say, \"Well hey, now I can raise my prices, too!\"?\u00a0 Absolutely! says Irwin: \"Consumers don't have the choice anymore. They can buy the really high-priced steel, or they can buy you.\"",
      "Finally, there's the retaliation problem. \"When we imposed the steel tariffs, the European Union and China got very upset with us,\" Irwin said. \"And what did they do? They raised tariffs on American farm goods. So, all of a sudden, American farmers, who had nothing to do with steel per se, found their sales limited overseas.\"",
      "Even Ronald Reagan could have told you that. In fact, he did! In 1987, Reagan said, \"High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars. The result is more and more tariffs, higher and higher trade barriers, and less and less competition.\"",
      "So, exactly what tariffs has Trump proposed? During his campaign, he promised as president he would \"phase in a system of universal baseline tariffs.\" Originally, he outlined tariffs across the board -- every product, in every category, from every country in the world. \"We're going to charge them 10 to 20 percent,\" he said.",

      "Retailers tell consumers that Trump tariffs are a reason to shop now",
      "Why is Trump threatening a 100% tariff on the BRICS nations?",
      "Now, every recent president has favored some tariffs. The Biden administration, for example, maintained some of the tariffs from Trump's first term, and imposed its own 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars. But these tariffs have always targeted particular categories of products. \"An across-the-board tariff? That's not targeting a particular commodity or product, that's not targeting a particular country,\" said Irwin. \"It's just saying, 'All imports, all sources get hit with this tax.' That's a very different type of tariff.\"",
      "And wouldn't we then notice prices going up, on everything?\u00a0 \"We would definitely notice,\" Irwin said.",
      "More recently, Trump has proposed double-digit tariffs on everything imported from Mexico, Canada and China. They would raise the price we pay for things like fruit, lumber, electronics, oil, medicine, metal and beef.",

      "Small businesses are \"casualty of war\" in proposed Trump tariffs, Pittsburgh business owner says",
      "Studies have calculated that those tariffs will cost 1% of all American jobs (according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics); raise average car prices by $3,000 (according to Wolfe Research); and cost every American household at least $1,000 a year (according to Yale Budget Lab).",
      "But Trump's transition leader Howard Lutnick predicts that his boss won't tax imported goods for which there are no American-made alternatives. Back in September, Lutnick told CNBC, \"Tariffs are an amazing tool by the president to use. They're an amazing tool. But he understands, don't tariff stuff we don't make. If we don't make it, and you want to buy it, I don't want to put the price up.\"",
      "Can Trump impose tariffs without Congress? It's complicated, according to experts",
      "Can Trump impose tariffs without Congress? It's complicated, according to experts",
      "But maybe Trump has no intention of imposing the tariffs for real? Maybe he's playing a strategic game -- tariffs as negotiating tactics?",
      "\"Tariffs can be used as a threat and a bargaining chip,\" said Irwin. \"And sometimes, if you're really credible, just making the threat of a tariff is enough to bring another country to change its policy in a way that you desire without your actually having to impose the tariff in the end.\"",
      "In the end, when a government wants to achieve some economic or geopolitical goal, it can use all kinds of different tools: subsidies, tax breaks or penalties, trade agreements, regulations, certifications, investment incentives, diversification.",
      "According to Doug Irwin, tariffs are a powerful tool, too. They're just rarely the best one. \"What economists have concluded is that tariffs usually have a lot of unintended consequences, can lead to blowback where other countries retaliate against you, and so are not a really good policy instrument for achieving goals that we all Americans want to achieve,\" he said.",

    "summary": "The public's deep frustration with the health insurance industry is coming to the surface online after the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson\u200b.",
    "story": [
      "The fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson is surfacing the public's deep frustration with the health insurance industry.",
      "On \"CBS Mornings\" Friday, Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News said the main issue is that health care costs are too high.",
      "\"What we see in this country is that the number one cause of bankruptcy is health-care-related expenses,\" she said.",
      "After groceries, transportation and rent, health care costs are the No. 1 cost of concern to families in this country, according to KFF polling.",
      "\"We've gotten to a point where health care is so inaccessible and unaffordable, people are justified in their frustrations,\" Gounder said.",
      "Can the insurance industry do something about high costs?",
      "There are things that can be done, Gounder said.",
      "Under President Barack Obama, for example, there was the Affordable Care Act, which helped to expand health insurance.",
      "\"You had Medicaid, you had the marketplace, then you also have subsidies to make it more affordable to purchase plans on the marketplace,\" Gounder said. \"Those were made even more generous during the pandemic, and then those more generous subsidies were extended under the Inflation Reduction Act under President Biden.\"",
      "But, there is still the challenge of why health care costs are rising.",
      "\"You have efforts to extend coverage and make more people have health care be available, but prices are going up,\" Gounder said.",
      "What could change in U.S. health care look like?",
      "In the U.S., people are faced with both rising health care costs and insurance premiums.",
      "According to a\u00a0KFF poll\u00a0from earlier this year, a quarter of U.S. adults say they've skipped or postponed getting the care they need simply because of the cost.",
      "Compared with other developed countries, the U.S has a different, \"very piecemeal\" approach, Gounder said.",
      "\"Many other countries have what we call socialized medicine,\" Gounder said. \"By the way, Medicare is socialized medicine, and even that socialized medicine is the most expensive in terms of health care for the elderly in the world.\"",
      "Many different proposals have been made to improve the situation, she said, including the Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to negotiate down the price of drugs.",
      "\"We've already seen one round of price negotiations. The incoming administration wants to eliminate the Inflation Reduction Act, at least many of the provisions of that. So whether that will continue, we don't know,\" she said.",
      "There have also been mergers and acquisitions in the health care industry, which means less competition.",
      "\"Biden administration has really been trying to pursue antitrust suits to block some of these,\" Gounder said. \"The Trump administration, the prior administration, tried to make health care pricing more transparent. That was another way of trying to make things better. It's not enough. These are all sort of chipping away at a bigger problem.\"",
      "What you can do if a claim is denied",
      "In posts to social media, doctors are sharing their experiences with more and more claims being denied \u2014 something Gounder is seeing too.",
      "\"What we're also seeing now is increasing use of AI by the insurance companies to deny claims, and then you have competing AIs being developed by health care systems to fight the health insurance AIs,\" she said. \"Me as a doctor, I have to spend a lot of time on the phone with various different companies to try to explain why my patient is in the hospital.\"",
      "If you are finding your claims to be denied, Gounder suggests following a few steps:",
      "Collect all of the paperwork you can to make your case",
      "Review very carefully the statements that are sent to you and what the issues are",
      "See what your doctor can do to start in terms of filing an appeal",

    "story": [
      "In the wake of\u00a0UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson's killing in New York City Wednesday morning, some companies are taking additional precautionary measures to protect their executives while corporate security firms are reporting an uptick in interest in their services.",
      "The shooting of Thompson, who did not appear to have a security detail with him when he was attacked outside a Manhattan hotel, is shining a light on the business of protecting prominent corporate executives, whose security costs can reach millions of dollars per year.",
      "It's common for the top brass at public companies to be protected by guards around the clock, according to security experts. Social media's amplification of everyday individuals' dissatisfaction with a particular person, product or service has only heightened the need for protection, they say. That's particularly true in an industry like health care insurance, when many Americans say they are dissatisfied with the services they receive.",
      "Indeed, in the wake of Thompson's killing, many on social media expressed vitriol for some health insurers' practices.",
      "\"We've gotten to a point where health care is so inaccessible and unaffordable, people are justified in their frustrations,\" Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, told CBS Mornings about the public voicing its frustrations.",
      "To be sure, some of the biggest U.S. companies, particularly those in the tech sector, were spending heavily on personal and residential security for their top executives prior to Thompson's killing. Meta, whose businesses include Facebook and Instagram, reported the highest spending on personal security for top executives last year, at more than $24 million, filings culled by research firm Equilar show.",
      "While Thompson had an in-house security detail during his New York City visit, it wasn't with him at the time of the shooting, according to CNN, which cited a source familiar with UnitedHealthcare's security.",
      "In the wake of the attack, corporate security experts said companies should take time to evaluate their corporate security protocols and beef up protective measures, if necessary, to protect against a variety of threats.",
      "\"My phone has been ringing off hook, with calls in particular coming from health care leaders who are reevaluating their security,\" said Paul Sarnese, a safety and security consultant and former president of the International Association for Healthcare Security and Safety (IAHSS).",
      "He said the deadly incident will likely prompt more executives to seek more robust protection. \"This incident will definitely change those executives' minds that might have been reluctant to initiate security protocols. I think they'll be more receptive to executive protection,\" he said.",
      "Too much information",
      "In the wake of Thompson's death, some companies are taking steps to limit publicly available information about their executives. For example, a page on UnitedHealthcare's website about the company's leadership \u2014 where Thompson and other executives' bios were listed \u2014\u00a0no longer exists, and instead redirects to the company's home page.",
      "Medica, a Minnesota-based nonprofit health care firm, as well as other insurers have taken similar actions, their websites show.",
      "Medica told the Associated Press Friday that it is temporarily closing its six offices for security reasons, in addition to removing executives bios' from its website.",
      "\"Although we have received no specific threats related to our campuses, our office buildings will be temporarily closed out of an abundance of caution,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Experts say these types of moves are wise.",
      "\"I think we share too much. I don't need to know where you live and that you're married and have three wonderful kids,\" Sarnese said. \"We don't need to advertise to the public where the president and CEO are sitting.\"",
      "While executives across all industries should be evaluating their security postures, healthcare industry professionals have received more threats in recent years as a result of divisiveness that arose around safety protocols, including mask mandates, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Sarnese said.",
      "\"Every industry has challenges because there is always going to be somebody who is upset with a service or product or philosophy. But COVID changed everything. We never saw the level of threats we saw during COVID toward healthcare workers and leaders, because of some of the mistrust and misinformation that was out there in the community,\" he said.",
      "\"All the ways things can go wrong\"",
      "Security industry veteran Brittney Blair of K2 Integrity said that online threat monitoring is as essential as physical protection.",
      "More companies are becoming more active in tracking cyber threats, including monitoring the web and dark web.",

    "published": "Thu, 12 Dec 2024 10:47:00 -0500",
    "summary": "\"These actions represent the largest single-day grant of clemency in modern history,\" the White House said.",
    "story": [
      "President Biden is commuting the sentences of nearly 1,500 people who were released from prison and placed on home confinement during the coronavirus pandemic and is pardoning 39 Americans convicted of nonviolent crimes. It's the largest single-day act of clemency in modern history.",
      "The White House has not released the names of those who received relief.",
      "The commutations announced Thursday are for people who have served out home confinement sentences for at least one year after they were released. Prisons were uniquely bad for spreading the virus and some inmates were released in part to stop the spread. At one point, 1 in 5 prisoners had COVID-19, according to a tally kept by The Associated Press.",
      "\"These actions represent the largest single-day grant of clemency in modern history,\" the White House said.",
      "Mr. Biden said he would be taking more steps in the weeks ahead and would continue to review clemency petitions. The second largest single-day act of clemency was by Barack Obama, with 330, shortly before he left office in 2017.",
      "\"America was built on the promise of possibility and second chances,\" Mr. Biden said in a statement. \"As president, I have the great privilege of extending mercy to people who have demonstrated remorse and rehabilitation, restoring opportunity for Americans to participate in daily life and contribute to their communities, and taking steps to remove sentencing disparities for non-violent offenders, especially those convicted of drug offenses.\"",
      "The clemency follows a broad pardon for his son Hunter, who was prosecuted for gun and tax crimes, criticizing the Justice Department's handling of his son's case in his statement explaining the pardon. The president had previously said he would not pardon Hunter. One of Mr. Biden's closest allies, former top aide Anita Dunn, said she agreed with his decision to pardon Hunter but she criticized the way in which the pardon happened.",
      "\"I do not agree with the way it was done, I don't agree with the timing, and I don't agree, frankly, with the attack on our judicial system,\" Dunn said at The New York Times' annual DealBook summit.",
      "Mr. Biden is under pressure from advocacy groups to pardon broad swaths of people, including those on federal death row, before the Trump administration takes over in January. He's also weighing whether to issue preemptive pardons to those who investigated Trump's effort to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and are facing possible retribution when he takes office.",
      "Those pardoned Thursday had been convicted of nonviolent crimes such as drug offenses and turned their lives around, White House lawyers said. They include a woman who led emergency response teams during natural disasters; a church deacon who has worked as an addiction counselor and youth counselor; a doctoral student in molecular biosciences; and a decorated military veteran.",
      "The president had previously issued 122 commutations and 21 other pardons. He's also broadly pardoned those convicted of use and simple possession of marijuana on federal lands and in the District of Columbia, and pardoned former U.S. service members convicted of violating a now-repealed military ban on consensual gay sex.",
      "Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts and 34 other lawmakers are urging the president to pardon environmental and human rights lawyer Steven Donziger, who was imprisoned or under house arrest for three years because of a contempt of court charge related to his work representing Indigenous farmers in a lawsuit against Chevron.",
      "Others are advocating for Mr. Biden to commute the sentences of federal death row prisoners. His attorney general, Merrick Garland, paused federal executions. Mr. Biden had said on the campaign trail in 2020 that he wanted to end the death penalty but he never did, and now, with Trump coming back into office, it's likely executions will resume. During his first term, Trump presided over an unprecedented number of federal executions, carried out during the height of the pandemic.",
      "More pardons are coming before Mr. Biden leaves office on Jan. 20, but it's not clear whether he'll take action to guard against possible prosecution by Trump, an untested use of the power.",
      "\"My administration will continue reviewing clemency petitions to advance equal justice under the law, promote public safety, support rehabilitation and reentry, and provide meaningful second chances,\" Mr. Biden said in a statement.",
      "The president has been taking the idea seriously and has been thinking about it for as much as six months - before the presidential election - but has been concerned about the precedent it would set, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions.",
      "But those who received the pardons would have to accept them. New California Sen. Adam Schiff, who was the chairman of the congressional committee that investigated the violent Jan. 6 insurrection, said such a pardon from Mr. Biden would be \"unnecessary,\" and that the president shouldn't be spending his waning days in office worrying about this.",
      "A president has the power to both pardon, in which a person is relieved of guilt and punishment, or commute a sentence, which reduces or eliminates the punishment but doesn't exonerate the wrongdoing. It's customary for a president to grant mercy at the end of his term, using the power of the office to wipe away records or end prison terms.",
      "Before pardoning his son, Mr. Biden had repeatedly pledged not to do so. He said in a statement explaining his reversal that the prosecution had been poisoned by politics. The decision prompted criminal justice advocates and lawmakers to put additional public pressure on the administration to use that same power for everyday Americans. It wasn't a very popular move; only about 2 in 10 Americans approved of his decision, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "\"The President's categorical approach to clemency has also inspired leaders across the country to take similar action,\" the White House said Thursday. \"Over ten states and localities, including Maryland and Massachusetts, have issued categorical clemency for marijuana convictions, impacting hundreds of thousands of people and allowing individuals to move past their convictions and move on with their daily lives.\"",

      "Trump is only the second president to have non-consecutive terms in office, the other being Grover Cleveland in the late 1800s.",
      "The magazine outlined Trump's comeback during the wild 2024 campaign: how he cleared the GOP field to clinch the nomination; spent three weeks in May in a New York courtroom before ultimately being convicted; survived two assassination attempts; consolidated support from Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Elon Musk; and overcame the swapping of the Democratic nominee.",
      "\"The election gave Trump political capital to address the sources of American discontent at home and abroad,\" Time's article said. \"The question now is how he intends to spend it. By his own account, Trump will push the limits of presidential power and the law.\"",

      "Trump also told the magazine that he told former Rep. Matt Gaetz, Trump's first pick for attorney general who withdrew his name from consideration, that he didn't think \"this is worth the fight.\"",

    "story": [
      "FBI Director Christopher Wray announced he will resign from his post at the end of the current administration, leaving the bureau in advance of President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration next month.",
      "He made the announcement during a packed, standing-room town hall with FBI employees at the bureau's headquarters Wednesday.",
      "\"After weeks of careful thought, I've decided the right thing for the bureau is for me to serve until the end of the current administration in January and then step down,\" he said. \"My goal is to keep the focus on\u202four mission \u2014 the indispensable work you're doing on behalf of the American people every day. In my view, this is the best way to avoid dragging the bureau deeper into the fray, while reinforcing the values and principles that are so important to how we do our work.\"",
      "\"It should go without saying, but I'll say it anyway \u2014 this is not easy for me,\" Wray continued. \"I love this place, I love our mission, and I love our people \u2014 but my focus is, and always has been, on us and doing what's right for the FBI.\"",
      "Thousands from FBI offices across the country tuned in for the live stream of his speech. Some people cried as Wray spoke. At the end of his remarks, he received a standing ovation that went on for over a minute, until Wray left the room.",
      "The president-elect welcomed Wray's announcement in a social media post, calling it \"a great day for America.\"",
      "Trump appointed Wray \u2014 a former federal prosecutor and counterterrorism official \u2014 as FBI director in 2017 for a 10-year term after firing James Comey. Wray has since come under fire from Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill over the FBI's handling of investigations into the president-elect. He has remained director under President Biden, but Trump previously said he intended to remove Wray and replace him with Kash Patel, a former GOP congressional staffer who was tapped by Trump during his first term for roles in the Defense Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.",
      "Wray told the FBI's rank and file, \"We're not on any one side \u2026 We're on the American people's side,\" and on \"the Constitution's side,\" adding, that \"no matter what's happening out there, in here, we've got to stay committed to doing our work the right way every time \u2014 with rigor and integrity.\"",
      "Attorney General Merrick Garland praised Wray, saying in a statement that he \"has served our country honorably and with integrity for decades, including for seven years as the Director of the FBI under presidents of both parties.\"",
      "\"The Director of the FBI is responsible for protecting the independence of the FBI from inappropriate influence in its criminal investigations,\" Garland said. \"That independence is central to preserving the rule of law and to protecting the freedoms we as Americans hold dear. Director Wray has done that job with integrity and skill.\"",
      "CBS News has learned Wray wrestled with his decision to step down but opted to go because he's concerned if he were to stay, the attacks on him could drag the FBI into another political fight it doesn't need.",
      "FBI directors are appointed for a 10-year term, which has historically been intended to ensure the position is insulated from political considerations. But presidents have the power to fire and nominate directors at will, and many FBI directors have not served their full terms. The Senate must also vote to confirm any president's nominee to serve as FBI director.",
      "Wray's announcement clears the way for Patel to lead the FBI in Trump's second term. Patel has been meeting in the Capitol with senators who will vote on his confirmation.",
      "Wray and FBI leadership became targets of Trump's ire in 2022, when FBI agents executed a court-authorized search warrant at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. The search exposed what had been an ongoing federal probe into Trump's handling of classified records after he left office. The investigation culminated in criminal charges against Trump filed by special counsel Jack Smith, but they have since been dismissed by a federal judge. Trump pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.",
      "If confirmed, Patel would be the third FBI director to work under a Trump administration and take over the nation's chief federal law enforcement apparatus, amid years of intense criticism from Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill. While Wray's departure from the job was largely expected, Trump's announcement that he planned to nominate Patel to the position raised speculation among federal law enforcement about whether Wray would resign or remain in his post ahead of Trump's inauguration.",
      "Wray took over the post after Trump fired then-Director James Comey, in part because of the FBI's investigation into the 2016 election that resulted in Robert Mueller's appointment as special counsel for that case. Comey, who has since become an outspoken critic of the president-elect, found himself at odds with Democrats and Republicans upon his departure from the FBI's top job.",
      "Since his confirmation in 2017, Wray has spent much of his tenure focusing on internal matters like agent recruitment and national security issues including countering China's espionage campaigns. He sounded the alarm on foreign efforts to target American infrastructure and warned of aggressive posturing by Iran and Russia.",
      "The FBI employs about 35,000 people \u2014 including thousands of field agents \u2014 tasked with enforcing federal law and investigating crimes across the country, including terrorism, espionage and child exploitation.",
      "Patel, who could soon be Wray's replacement, has been outspoken in his criticism of the federal agency and has said he would implement massive reforms and seek retribution for Trump, saying at one point, \"We're going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections.\"",
      "In his remarks, Wray reminded the bureau's employees that working at the FBI \"means conducting investigations without fear or favor ... and it means not pursuing investigations when the predication is not there.\"",
      "Patel would report directly to the attorney general of the United States \u2014\u00a0 Trump's current pick for the post is former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.",
      "Trump's announcement that he planned to nominate the 44-year-old Patel to serve as FBI Director was met with criticism from Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill and some former officials from Trump's first term.",
      "John Bolton, who served as national security adviser in Trump's first term and was Patel's boss, compared the nomination to Joseph Stalin's secret police chief.",
      "\"Fortunately, the FBI is not\" Stalin's secret police, Bolton said. \"The Senate should reject this nomination 100-0,\" a reaction that prompted pushback from Trump allies and Vice President-Elect J.D. Vance.",

While the majority of Democrats opposed the bill, 81 joined with 200 Republicans in support of its passage. Just 16 Republicans opposed the legislation. It now heads to the Senate for approval.",

      "Johnson cited a 14.5% pay raise for junior service members and improved housing for military families. And he celebrated an expansion of U.S. joint military exercises with Israel and increases in funding for defense initiatives in the Indo-Pacific, among other things.",

      "Blinken declined to take the blame for decisions that were made leading up to the exit, explaining that actions taken by the first Trump administration left the Biden administration in a weak position and intelligence assessments expected Kabul to remain the hands of the Afghan government.",
      "Blinken's testimony came nearly three months after the committee\u00a0voted\u00a0along party lines to recommend that the nation's top diplomat be held in contempt of Congress amid a standoff over his appearance before the panel to discuss its investigation into the\u00a02021 withdrawal.",
      "The committee and State Department had been at odds for months, leading Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the Republican chairman, to issue multiple subpoenas for Blinken to testify in September. McCaul said Blinken's appearance was important as the committee considers \"potential legislation aimed at helping prevent the catastrophic mistakes of the withdrawal.\"",
      "The Afghanistan hearing",
      "\"Tragically, more than three years after this administration's disastrous withdrawal, you're finally here to take responsibility,\" McCaul said Wednesday, also accusing Blinken in the lead up to the evacuation of denying \"imminent and dangerous threats to American interests, American citizens and our decade long Afghan partners, all the while, the Taliban captured province after province on their march to Kabul.\"",
      "Republicans on the committee released a lengthy report in September that detailed their yearslong investigation into the chaotic exit from Afghanistan and accused the Biden administration of misleading the public about the end of the 20-year war.",
      "Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the committee, on Wednesday called the report \"partisan and misleading\" and said Republicans have \"muddled the facts\" about whether a suicide bombing that killed 13 U.S. service members was preventable.",
      "Blinken, whose opening statement was repeatedly disrupted by protesters, acknowledged the service members who died and their families, saying he deeply regretted that the U.S. \"did not do more and could not do more to protect them.\"",
      "\"To the extent President Biden faced a choice, it was between ending the war or escalating it,\" Blinken said. \"In the three years since the end of our country's longest war. All of us, including myself, have wrestled with what we could have done differently during that period and over the proceeding two decades.\"",
      "Blinken also acknowledged that the Taliban was not in compliance with a deal the Trump administration struck with the group to withdraw U.S. forces from the country by May 2021. The deal, known as the Doha Agreement, laid out a series of conditions for the Taliban to fulfill in order for U.S. forces to fully leave Afghanistan.",
      "\"The Taliban was in violation of the Doha Agreement in a number of ways,\" he said. \"It was in violation when the previous administration drew down forces repeatedly. It was in violation during the time that we were in office before the evacuation.\"",
      "According to Blinken, the Biden administration unsuccessfully tried to get the Taliban to abide by the conditions and negotiate with the Afghan government.",
      "\"They didn't do that,\" he said. \"But because we had the deadline, and because we had the prospect of the Taliban resuming attacks on U.S. forces, which would have required us to put tens of thousands of Americans back into Afghanistan, we followed through with pulling them out.\"",
      "He said the Doha Agreement \"created a tremendous crisis in confidence\" in the Afghan government. The Afghan government was excluded from the Trump administration's negotiations with the Taliban that led to the agreement.",
      "Blinken said he was on the phone with then-Afghan President Ashraf Ghani the night before he fled the country as the Taliban closed in.",
      "\"He told me that he wanted to continue working on getting an agreement with the Taliban, but if he couldn't, he would stay and fight to the death,\" Blinken said. \"And he left the next day.\"",
      "Though the U.S. tried to get in contact with every U.S. citizen in the Afghanistan, Blinken said, hundreds who wanted to leave the country did not make it out before the withdrawal. As of now, \"every American who identified themselves and said that they wanted to leave has been given an opportunity to do so,\" he said. But some returned after the withdrawal and have been detained, he said.",
      "\"We are working every day to get them out, to get them back,\" he said.",
      "The committee's report",
      "During its investigation, the committee conducted 18 transcribed interviews with Biden administration officials and received more than 20,000 pages of documents from the State Department, some of which were obtained through subpoenas. Blinken was not among those who testified for the report, but the State Department noted amid the standoff with the committee that he has testified to Congress on Afghanistan more than 14 times.",
      "The report accused President Biden and his administration of ignoring repeated warnings from military officials, national security advisers and U.S. allies about the risks of removing all American forces from Afghanistan, saying Mr. Biden \"prioritized politics and his personal legacy over America's national security interests.\"",
      "Blinken was among those faulted in the report, which said he \"remained largely absent throughout the State Department's withdrawal planning\" and the evacuation.",
      "\"Indeed, witnesses interviewed, and documents produced by federal agencies pursuant to the investigation, confirm Secretary Blinken likely ceded his responsibility to subordinates on Afghanistan,\" the report said.",
      "Blinken advocated for the U.S. Embassy in Kabul to remain open regardless of the military withdrawal, according to the report, which said that the desire to maintain a diplomatic presence contributed to the State Department's \"lack of urgency and their delays in planning for the worst-case scenarios.\"",
      "The report also noted that diplomatic officials on the ground expressed concerns about the commitment to keep the embassy open despite the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan, culminating in a July 2021 dissent cable warning that Kabul would fall after the planned withdrawal. Two weeks before the U.S. troops left Afghanistan, State Department leaders agreed to shutter the embassy, the report said.",
      "Republicans threatened to hold Blinken in contempt of Congress in 2023 as they sought to review the classified dissent cable. The State Department eventually allowed lawmakers to view a partially redacted version.",
      "\"You personally read this, sir,\" McCaul said while questioning Blinken on Wednesday. \"Why did you ignore the cries for help? Why did you leave the embassy open?\"",
      "McCaul also said it appeared that Blinken delegated his responsibility and pressed him on who was calling the shots.",
      "\"To legislate moving forward, I need to know who was in charge,\" McCaul said, calling on Mr. Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan to testify to the committee.",
      "About 20 minutes later, McCaul announced that Sullivan had agreed to testify on Tuesday.",
      "Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee accused Republicans of politicizing the withdrawal and said the majority took \"particular pains to avoid facts involving former President Donald Trump.\"",
      "Last year, the White House released its own 12-page summary of a classified review of the Afghanistan exit that largely blamed the Trump administration for the Doha Agreement. Another report partially declassified and released by the State Department last year faulted both the Trump and Biden administrations for \"insufficient\" planning surrounding the withdrawal.",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 14:04:45 -0500",
    "summary": "A Democrat-led push to secure a majority on the National Labor Relations Board until 2026 fell short, facing opposition from Republicans and independents.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A Democrat-led push to secure a majority on the National Labor Relations Board until 2026 fell short on Wednesday, as Senate Republicans and two independents blocked the nomination of Lauren McFerran to continue serving on the labor board.",
      "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer filed cloture Monday on the nominations of McFerran, a Democrat, to remain for another five-year term on the National Labor Relations Board. McFerran is the current chair of the NLRB whose term is set to expire later this month. Her confirmation to another term would have maintained a Democratic majority on the board, in a move that would have marked a key victory for Democrats heading into a second Trump administration and a Republican trifecta in Washington.",
      "In a 50 to 49 vote, Senate Republicans, joined by independent Sens. Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin, blocked the nomination from advancing. Without the confirmation, the board is expected to swing to come under Republican control, with a vacancy for President-elect Donald Trump and the incoming GOP-controlled Senate to fill in the new year.",
      "Schumer praised McFerran ahead of the vote on Wednesday, saying she has \"served admirably on the NLRB for many years, where she's known for her fairness, her deep expertise and guiding the board to deal with the challenges of the contemporary work place.\"",
      "\"If you truly care about working families, if you care about fixing income inequality in America, then you should be in favor of advancing today's NLRB nominee,\" Schumer said, stressing that \"you can't say you're for working families and then go and vote no today, because the NLRB protects workers from mistreatment on the job and from overreaching employers.\"",
      "The NLRB is an independent federal agency with five board members that serves as a mediator between labor unions and big business by enforcing labor law under the National Labor Relations Act. Under the union-friendly Biden administration, the NLRB has delivered a slew of pro-union rulings.",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent and longtime labor advocate, posted Tuesday on social media\u00a0 that McFerran has \"done an exceptional job protecting workers' rights & standing up against illegal union busting,\" arguing that it's \"imperative that a majority of Senators vote to reconfirm her this week so she can continue this vital work.\"",
      "Republicans largely opposed the nomination, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who came out in opposition of McFerran's nomination on Tuesday. The Kentucky Republican, who is leaving leadership in January, said Tuesday in remarks from the Senate floor that his colleagues should consider the \"gross mismanagement of Ms. McFerran's watch.\"",
      "\"Her confirmation would give a lame-duck president control of an independent board well into his successor's term,\" McConnell added.",
      "Manchin, a West Virginia independent who caucuses with Democrats, also joined with Republicans to oppose advancing the nomination, as did Sinema, an Arizona independent. The two senators, who are often key votes on partisan measures, are both departing the Senate after opting not to seek reelection. Sen. Roger Marshall, a Kansas Republican, did not vote.",
      "The vote came as Senate Democrats have been making a last-minute push to confirm President Biden's remaining nominees to the nation's courts. Democrats are hoping to meet or surpass Trump's judicial confirmations from his first term, but have run into resistance from Republicans in recent weeks who are looking to drag out the process.",

    "summary": "\"The Task Force found that the tragic and shocking events in Butler, Pennsylvania were preventable and should not have happened,\" a House task force found.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House task force investigating the assassination attempts against President-elect Donald Trump released a final report on its probe on Tuesday, presenting a series of recommendations to combat future security failures, including reducing the number of officials it protects during campaign season.",
      "\"The Task Force found that the tragic and shocking events in Butler, Pennsylvania were preventable and should not have happened. There was not, however, a singular moment or decision that allowed Thomas Matthew Crooks to nearly assassinate the former President,\" the 180-page report said, noting that \"various failures \u2026 coalesced to create an environment in which the former President \u2014 and everyone at the campaign event \u2014 were exposed to grave danger.\"",
      "The House voted to establish the panel following the July 13 assassination attempt against Trump in Butler, where a gunman opened fire during a rally and a bullet grazed the former president's ear. Secret Service snipers shot and killed the gunman, identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks. The Secret Service came under intense scrutiny following the incident, and its director soon resigned.",
      "The task force, made up of seven Republicans and six Democrats, also looked into a second assassination attempt on Sept. 15 in West Palm Beach, Florida, which was foiled. Trump was golfing when a Secret Service agent discovered a man with a rifle who was waiting along the tree line of the course.",
      "What the report says",
      "Over the course of the investigation, the task force said it conducted 46 interviews, reviewed 18,000 pages of documents and visited the incident sites in Butler and West Palm Beach.",
      "The panel found that the \"failures\" that led to the July 13 incident were \"not isolated to the campaign event itself.\" The lawmakers noted that \"preexisting issues in leadership and training created an environment\" in which the failures could occur, like giving significant responsibilities to Secret Service personnel with little to no experience in advanced planning roles.",
      "\"The events of July 13, 2024, were tragic and preventable, and the litany of related security failures are unacceptable,\" the report says, acknowledging that the Secret Service's mission \"allows no margin for error.\"",
      "The task force made three dozen recommendations, including reducing the number of individuals it protects. The lawmakers also said Congress should examine whether the Secret Service should still be involved in investigating fraud and financial crimes.",
      "\"Congress must consider whether the Secret Service's investigative obligations can effectively coexist with its primary protective mission, and whether the agency's investigative functions should remain within the Department of Homeland Security,\" the report said.",
      "\"The number of individuals being protected has greatly expanded, a resource demand which becomes further taxed during the longer and more intensive modern presidential campaign seasons,\" it said, noting that the Secret Service also protects foreign dignitaries during the U.N. General Assembly in New York City in September, which comes at the height of the campaign season. \"As a result, Congress, DHS, and the USSS should jointly consider the protective role the USSS plays for foreign leaders and consider whether such duties can be transferred or abrogated in order to focus on the USSS's primary duty: to protect the President and other critical U.S. leaders.\"",
      "It also recommended that Secret Service consolidate the plans of all law enforcement entities working an event; fill gaps with its own personnel when local counterparts are unable to provide adequate security; identify all potential lines of sight vulnerabilities; require counter-surveillance assets for all large outdoor events; and address inadequate training. Other recommendations included reviewing protocols for identifying security breaches during golf outings and using a specific type of vehicle, which was redacted in the report, on the golf course.",
      "The panel also called on Congress to review the agency's financial and personnel resources, recommending that it take a look at \"reducing the pace of travel, ensuring overtime is properly compensated, and giving incentives for veteran agents to stay with the USSS beyond minimum retirement ages.\"",
      "While the panel's investigation has wrapped, the task force encouraged relevant committees in Congress to work to address \"important questions\" that it was unable to examine fully. On the top of that list, the panel said, are the motivations of the shooter and would-be shooter, which the panel said \"remain largely unknown.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 14:14:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Manhattan prosecutors say Donald Trump's election in November shouldn't mean his conviction in May needs to be vacated.",
    "story": [
      "New York prosecutors say President-elect Donald Trump's return to the White House should not undermine the decision of 12 jurors who found him guilty of dozens of felonies in May, telling the judge overseeing the case that the conviction should stand.",
      "\"This Court should reject [Trump's] motion to 'immediately' dismiss the indictment and vacate the jury's guilty verdict based on the outcome of the recent presidential election,\" prosecutors for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg wrote in their filing, which was made public Tuesday. \"There are no grounds for such relief now, prior to defendant's inauguration, because President-elect immunity does not exist.\"",
      "Soon after Trump's election in November, his defense lawyers promised to urge Justice Juan Merchan to toss his indictment in the \"hush money\" case and set aside the verdict. They made their motion on Dec. 2, hinging their push to discard the will of 12 jurors who sat for the seven-week trial on an unlikely subject: President Biden's son, Hunter. Trump's attorneys said the announcement of Hunter Biden's controversial pardon echoed Trump's complaints about his prosecution, claiming it was politically driven.",
      "Prosecutors did not mention either Biden or the pardon in their response filing.",
      "They hit back against the core of Trump's effort to set aside his conviction. Trump's lawyers \u2014 two of whom are slated to take on senior roles in the Justice Department after Trump's inauguration \u2014 have argued that it would be unconstitutional for an incoming president to carry the burden of a guilty verdict reached before his election.",
      "\"[Trump's] suggestion that his subsequent election 'superseded' the jury's verdict is deeply misguided,\" prosecutors wrote. \"As this Court carefully and correctly instructed the jury, it was the empaneled jurors who were 'deciding whether the Defendant is guilty or not guilty' because only these jurors \u2014 not the general electorate \u2014 heard all the evidence in this trial.\"",
      "Prosecutors argued Trump's lawyers are trying to \"effectively extend the period of [Trump's] immunity to a time before his presidency, by wiping out the effects of an indictment and jury verdict that took place before he was even reelected President.\"",
      "Trump's sentencing has been postponed three times since his conviction in May. It was initially scheduled for July 11, but Merchan pushed that date back so Trump's attorneys could file a separate motion to dismiss following a landmark Supreme Court ruling. The nation's highest court concluded in early July that former presidents could not be charged for official acts, and evidence related to their official work as president could not be used as evidence against them.",
      "Merchan has not ruled on that motion. He postponed the second sentencing date, Sept. 18, after Trump's lawyers argued it was too close to the election. After Trump's election victory on Nov. 5, they demanded a Nov. 26 sentencing date be postponed so they could file the new motion to dismiss the case, revolving around his return to the White House.",
      "Bragg's office said in its filing it would be open to postponing sentencing and other proceedings until after Trump's term in office, which ends in 2029.",
      "\"If [Trump] is not sentenced before his inauguration, there is also no legal barrier to deferring that sentencing until after the end of his presidency,\" they wrote.",
      "Prosecutors also floated terminating the case \"with a notation that the jury verdict has not been vacated and the indictment has not been dismissed,\" an option they acknowledged is typically used when defendants die before case proceedings conclude.",
      "\"Especially given the novelty of defendant's own immunity claims, it would hardly be improper for this Court to exercise its inherent authority to consider novel remedies such as adopting a version of the Alabama rule in the context of this unique case,\" prosecutors wrote.",
      "The judge's decision will be the latest moment in the case to set a historical precedent. Trump was the first person to be elected president after being convicted of crimes. When the unanimous jury concluded in May he was guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records, he became the first former president ever convicted of crimes. In March 2023, Trump became the first former president ever indicted when a grand jury concluded he should be charged.",
      "The case focused on a coverup of a \"hush money\" payment to an adult film star. Trump authorized a scheme to conceal reimbursements to a lawyer who made the payment days before Trump's first election.",
      "Trump pleaded not guilty in the case and has promised to appeal his conviction.",

    "story": [
      "The Justice Department failed to follow department policy and ignored some established protections when seeking records from members of Congress, dozens of congressional staffers and members of the media during the first Trump administration, an internal watchdog found.",
      "A report by the department's Office of Inspector General released on Tuesday focused on numerous leak investigations launched by the Justice Department and the FBI between 2017 and 2020 to determine how eight journalists from the Washington Post, the New York Times and CNN obtained classified information that appeared in reports. The data mostly included metadata about emails and phone calls, and did not contain the content of the communications.",
      "In 2017, FBI investigators honed in on members of Congress and their staff as possible sources of various news reports, eventually obtaining data from two Democratic lawmakers and 43 congressional staffers from both parties. Inspector General Michael Horowitz criticized the large number of congressional employees whose information was obtained, and urged the department to implement stronger policies to protect the data of members of Congress and their staff.",
      "\"[D]ozens of congressional staffers became part of the subject pool in a federal criminal investigation for doing nothing more than performing constitutionally authorized oversight of the executive branch,\" the report said. In a 2023 lawsuit against the Justice Department, Kash Patel, Trump's pick to serve as FBI director in the upcoming administration, said he was one of those staffers while working for the House Intelligence Committee. Patel alleged the collection was \"in complete contravention of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\"",
      "The inspector general also revealed the two lawmakers were targeted because a Democratic staffer \"identified them to investigators as potential leakers but without providing any evidentiary support for the claim.\"",
      "CBS News reported in 2021 that Justice Department prosecutors had subpoenaed Apple for data from the accounts of Reps. Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell of California while investigating leaks of classified information related to contacts between aides to President-Elect Donald Trump and Russia in the early days of the Trump administration. Both men criticized the investigative steps at the time. Schiff was sworn in this week as the next senator from California, and Swalwell remains in the House.",
      "There were four secret investigations in total, all of which were closed without criminal charges. The probes emerged into public view in 2021, when the Biden administration informed the three news organizations that their records had been swept up in the Trump-era probes. The Post, the Times and CNN each announced and condemned the revelations at the time.",
      "Notably, the inspector general's review said there was no evidence that the investigations were influenced by politics or other improper considerations. The report also said that certain processes and approvals that are now required were not in place at the time.",
      "However, the report said the decision to go after the communications of congressional staffers and members \"implicated the constitutional rights and authorities or a co-equal branch of government.\"",
      "Such conduct, the report argued, \"risks chilling Congress' ability to conduct oversight of the executive branch.\" The inspector general said there was no definitive department policy on the matter and much of the decision-making was left up to line prosecutors on the cases. As a result, the report called for further safeguards and policy changes, some of which have been implemented.",
      "Unlike investigations into members of Congress, Justice Department policy stipulates that prosecutors must first prove to have \"exhausted\" other avenues before seeking to secretly obtain records from members of the media. But Horowitz found investigators in 2020 \"did not fully adhere\" to other policies when they turned their attention to the news media organizations that published the classified information.",
      "According to the report, then-Attorney General William Barr authorized the collection of the journalists' communication data because policy required senior approval for investigations into journalists, but prosecutors working on the cases did not follow other procedures. Horowitz found that in all of the investigations, the Justice Department's New Media Review Committee \u2014 a group of officials within the department tasked with reviewing such investigative steps \u2014 was not established. The report also said prosecutors failed to obtain necessary sign-off from the intelligence community before collecting communications data in at least one instance.",
      "Unsealed court records showed the requests were made in the final weeks of Trump's first term. Barr did not agree to be interviewed for the inspector general's report. The former head of the Justice Department's national security division told the inspector general Barr and his predecessor had \"made it very clear leak investigations were a priority of the Department.\"",
      "\"In our judgment, the Department's deviation from its own requirements indicates a troubling disparity between, on the one hand, the regard expressed in Department policy for the roles of the news media in American democracy and, on the other hand, the Department's commitment to complying with the limits and requirements that it intended to safeguard that very role,\" Horowitz wrote.",
      "Following the revelations that the reporters were subjects of the Trump-era Justice Department investigations, the Garland Justice Department changed department policies governing news media organizations.",

      "Trump said in an interview with NBC News\u00a0that he told Trudeau Canada needs to \"close\" its borders to prevent migrants and drugs from \"pouring in.\" And if he doesn't close the Canadian border, Trump said he would impose a 25% tariff on imports from Canada. He leveled the same threats against Mexico.",
      "Trump has complained about fentanyl coming into the U.S. from Mexico and Canada, even though there have been fewer seizures from across the Canadian border than from the Mexican border.

      "Washington \u2014 A group of Senate Democrats is pressing President Biden to work to \"protect immigrant families\" in the final weeks of his presidency, with President-elect Donald Trump set to take office next month.",
      "\"As Senators who represent diverse states across our nation and who collectively represent millions of immigrant families, we write to express our deep concern about the threat the incoming administration poses to immigrants in our communities,\" the group of senators, led by Democratic Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois, wrote in a letter to the president Monday.",
      "The senators cited Trump's threat of mass deportations that they say will \"jeopardize the safety and security\" of millions of families, \"sow deep distrust and fear\" in the communities and \"destabilize the U.S. economy.\" And they urged Mr. Biden to take a number of actions in advance of Trump's inauguration, stressing that the \"window to secure and finalize your administration's policies is closing rapidly.\"",
      "\"We urge you to act decisively between now and the inauguration of the President-elect to complete the important work of the past four years and protect immigrant families,\" Durbin said in the letter, which was also signed by Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n of New Mexico and Alex Padilla of California.",
      "Among the requests, the group asked the president to prioritize redesignating and extending Temporary Protected Status for all eligible countries, which allows migrants from countries experiencing unsafe conditions to legally reside in the U.S. The group also asked the president to expedite the processing of benefit requests for recipients of DACA, the program for hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children and have been granted protection from deportation.",
      "The push comes as Trump has made clear his intention to pursue a radical shift on immigration policy, which became a key part of his campaign as he promised to target both unauthorized and legal immigrants with unprecedented measures.",
      "In an interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that aired Sunday, reiterated a number of the pledges, including that he's \"absolutely\" still planning to end birthright citizenship on Day One of his presidency. He also made clear that he plans to carry out his mass deportations pledge, beginning with criminals.",
      "When asked by host Kristen Welker whether it's possible to deport everyone who's in the U.S. illegally, Trump responded that \"you have no choice.\" He said his administration would be \"starting with the criminals\" before others, noting that \"we're going to see how it goes.\"",
      "On DACA recipients, known as Dreamers, Trump said he would work with Democrats on a plan, claiming that \"Republicans are very open to the Dreamers.\"",
      "\"I want to be able to work something out,\" Trump said, while indicating that he wants the DACA recipients to be able to stay. Legislative efforts to codify the DACA program have failed for more than a decade, and Republican-led states have filed numerous lawsuits over the years arguing the program is unconstitutional. The president-elect tried to end the program during his first administration.",
      "On immigrant families more broadly, Trump emphasized that he doesn't \"want to be breaking up families,\" saying that \"the only way you don't break up the family is you keep them together and you have to send them all back.\"",
      "In their letter, the senators noted that while they support \"commonsense\" border security measures, they \"will continue to oppose any policies that contradict our nation's core values.\"",

      "The oldest known wild bird in the world has laid an egg at the ripe age of about 74, her first in four years, U.S. wildlife officials said.",
      "The long-winged seabird named Wisdom, a Laysan albatross, returned to Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge at the northwestern edge of the Hawaiian Archipelago and laid what experts estimate may be her 60th egg, the Pacific Region of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service said in a Facebook post this week.",
      "Wisdom and her mate, Akeakamai, had returned to the atoll in the Pacific Ocean to lay and hatch eggs since 2006. Laysan albatrosses mate for life and lay one egg per year, but according to the USFWS, Akeakamai hadn't been seen for several years, prompting \"Wisdom to begin courtship dances with other males\" as soon as she returned to the island last week.",

The 60 Minutes team found that many of Wisdom's fellow albatrosses have died around her with bellies full of plastic, making her a source of some optimism for researchers.",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 14:39:54 -0500",
    "summary": "Engineers now say they understand the most likely cause of the Ingenuity helicopter's crash landing on Mars earlier this year.",
    "story": [
      "Nearly a year after NASA's Ingenuity helicopter crash landed on Mars following an extended, remarkably successful mission, engineers have determined the most likely culprit: Flight over sand drifts so featureless that on-board sensors could not determine the helicopter's orientation and velocity.",
      "The result was a \"hard\" sideways landing on a steep slope that spun Ingenuity about so fast its rotors, spinning at nearly 400 mph to provide lift in the ultra-thin martian atmosphere, suffered structural failure. One broke off and the others were severely damaged.",
      "H\u00e5vard Grip, Ingenuity's first pilot, said in an interview Wednesday that lessons learned from Ingenuity's 72nd and final flight on Jan. 18 will be fed into designs for more powerful Mars helicopters now being studied at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory where Ingenuity was built.",
      "\"We're working very actively right now on what that might look like,\" Grip said in an interview. \"We're developing this large aircraft concept with six rotors and 36 blades that could fly its own science payload around Mars. So that is kind of where our focus is in the helicopter world right now.\"",
      "During a briefing Wednesday at the American Geophysical Union's annual meeting in Washington, D.C., Teddy Tzanetos, the Ingenuity project manager, discussed the six-rotor Mars Chopper concept, a rotorcraft that would be 20 times heavier than Ingenuity and could fly up to two miles per day carrying several pounds of science instrumentation.",
      "Ingenuity \"became the first mission to fly commercial off-the-shelf cellphone processors in deep space,\" Tzanetos said in a NASA news release. The mission showed \"that not everything needs to be bigger, heavier and radiation-hardened to work in the harsh Martian environment.\"",
      "Carried to Mars by NASA's Perseverance rover, Ingenuity was dropped to the surface of the red planet in April 2021 and made its initial flight two weeks later. Built primarily to find out if helicopters could fly in the cold, thin atmosphere, Ingenuity was expected to make five flights over 30 days as a proof of concept.",
      "The the surprise of virtually everyone, it ended up making 72 flights over nearly three years, repeatedly scouting ahead of Perseverance while logging more than two hours of flight time and traveling a cumulative 10.7 miles at altitudes up to nearly 80 feet before its final flight on Jan. 18.",
      "During that flight, Ingenuity climbed to an altitude of about 40 feet, hovered and captured photographs of the surrounding terrain and began to descend 19 seconds after takeoff. Thirteen seconds after that, the helicopter was back on the ground, but contact had been lost.",
      "Communications through Perseverance were restored the next day, and six days after the flight, the rover sent back pictures showing the helicopter had sustained major damage to its rotors.",
      "Flight controllers initially suspected Ingenuity made a hard landing at a steep angle, causing its high-speed rotors to hit the ground.",
      "But the most likely scenario, Grip said, is that the helicopter was unable to determine its horizontal velocity as it flew over virtually featureless sand and touched down while moving sideways at a speed well above its design constraints.",
      "\"We also landed on a steep slope, probably the steepest slope that we have encountered in all of our flights,\" he said. \"The combination of the two lends itself well to what our most likely scenario hypothesizes.",
      "\"When it contacted the ground, it sort of whipped around quickly in order to align itself with the surface. That forces the helicopter to rotate around in roll and pitch, and because this rotor is stiff, the rotor has to sort of follow more or less instantly, and that puts a lot of bending moments on the blades.\"",
      "Those bending moments, or forces, were extreme because the tips of the rotors were moving so fast. The tips of the blades broke away, putting the rotor system out of balance. That, in turn, resulted in enough vibration to cause one rotor to break off at its root. Grip said none of the blades touched the surface during the landing.",
      "In yet another surprise for flight controllers, Ingenuity came to a rest on its landing legs with its small solar array pointed skyward. While it could no longer fly, it continued to relay martian weather reports to Perseverance through last November when the rover finally moved too far away to maintain the radio link.",
      "\"I always pictured that a bad landing would end with, you know, the thing just in 1,000 pieces on the surface,\" Grip said. \"So the fact that it's upright and talking to us (was) not at all what I would have anticipated.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Geminid meteor shower peak is a week away, but this year it might be a good idea to keep an eye out early, according to NASA. Dedicated skywatchers might want to check the sky not only in the days ahead of the peak, however \u2014 but also early in the morning.",
      "The shower will peak from Friday Dec. 13 into early Saturday Dec. 14 \u2014 when the moon is nearly full, according to NASA. Illumination from the moon could make spotting the cosmic show a challenge during the peak, but bright meteors can be spotted the week before the peak.",
      "Here's what you should know about the Geminids meteor shower, including how to watch:",
      "Where you can see the Geminids",
      "Meteors from the Geminids will be visible throughout the sky and across the globe, according to NASA. They're best viewed in an area far away from city and street lights.",
      "Viewers \u2014 who should prepare for frigid temperatures \u2014 should lie flat on their backs with their feet facing south. Give your eyes a half hour to adjust to the dark.",
      "The shower usually starts around 9 or 10 p.m. local time, with the meteors best viewed at night or in the pre-dawn hours.",
      "EarthSky, an astronomy website published by experts in the field, suggests finding a way to block out the moon when watching for the Geminids.",
      "\"So with moonlit skies in 2024, you might only catch the brightest meteors,\" according to EarthSky. \"Luckily, many of the Geminids are bright meteors. Try blocking out the moon when watching for meteors.\"",
      "Are any nights this year good for Geminid viewing?",
      "Casual observers won't be able to pick up any noticeable activity from the Geminids until the night of Dec. 11, according to Bill Cooke, lead of NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office. More than half of the moon's surface will already be illuminated by the sun at that point of the month, so it will still cause some problems with meteor viewing.",
      "Astronomy fans determined to see the Geminids without interference from the moon's light may have some luck if they're willing to get up after moon-set around 3:30 a.m. local time, Cooke said. Even then though, it will be a challenge to spot many Geminids an hour.",
      "\"In short, 2024 is a bad year for Geminid watching \u2013 December 2025 will be much better,\" Cooke said.",
      "What are the Geminids?",
      "Most meteor showers originate from comets, but the Geminids come from 3200 Phaethon, an asteroid. The Geminids first appeared in the mid-1800s. At the time, there were 10 to 20 meteors an hour, but the shower has grown bigger and meteors are now visible at a rate of 120 meteors an hour under perfect conditions.",
      "While most meteors appear to be colorless or white, NASA scientists say the Geminids are bright, fast and usually yellow in color. They streak through the sky at a speed of 22 miles per second.",
      "Meteors are space rocks that enter Earth's atmosphere and heat up as they fall toward Earth, according to NASA. The streak of light is actually glowing, hot air.",

      "The California Public Utilities Commission alleged the company covered up details of the crash and suspended Cruise's driverless testing permit. Soon afterwards, Cruise\u00a0pulled all its driverless cars off the road nationwide.",
      "The incident\u00a0sparked widespread criticism of the company\u00a0and its autonomous vehicles. Cruise had already been under fire for a number of collisions that led the company to\u00a0cut its operating robotaxi fleet in during the summer of 2023.",

      "The FTC alleges the Fortnite-maker used dark patterns along with a variety of other tactics to trick customers into making unwanted purchases.",
      "For example, a \"counterintuitive, inconsistent, and confusing button configuration\" led Fortnite players to easily incur unwanted charges with the press of a single button, according to the FTC. Additionally, trying to transition the game from sleep to wake mode often triggered unwanted purchases. Other times, pressing an \"adjacent button\" while trying to preview an item led to a charge.",

      "Forty-year-old Dominique Moore said he was \"thankful and blessed\" after his release from a state prison in El Dorado. And cheers from a crowd of relatives greeted Cedric Warren, 34, as he walked out of jail in the county where he was convicted nearly 15 years ago in the drug house shooting that killed Charles Ford and Larry Ledoux.",
      "The men's life sentences had carried no chance of parole for 25 years.",
      "Warren did not speak with the media, but family members voiced their relief and joy, CBS affiliate KCTV reported.",
      "\"I really want to cry, but I can't. That's how overwhelmed I am,\" Warren's father, Cedric Toney, said after a vehicle carrying his son pulled away from the jail. Warren himself was too overcome to talk to a throng of reporters who awaited his release.",
      "Toney alleged misconduct from Roger Golubski, who died last week in an apparent suicide just before the start of his criminal trial over allegations that he sexually assaulted Black women.",
      "But that had nothing to do with Wyandotte County Judge Aaron Roberts' decision to toss Warren's convictions on Monday and Moore's on Wednesday. Roberts found that prosecutors failed to turn over information about the severe mental health issues of a key witness. The witness had schizophrenia, and offered a shifting account of what happened, the defense wrote in court filings.",
      "Not aired in court was Toney's claim that before Golubski supervised the investigation that led to his son's arrest, the former detective stalked Toney's daughter and his son's mother. He said he suspected his son's first stop would be their graves; both died while he was incarcerated.",
      "The allegation of misconduct is similar to one raised in the case of Lamonte McIntyre, who served 23 years behind bars for a double homicide before he was freed. McIntyre's mother has said Golubski pressured her for sexual favors.",
      "Wyandotte County District Attorney Mark Dupree could have retried Warren and Moore but announced Wednesday that he wouldn't, paving the way for their release.",
      "He said Golubski's involvement had nothing to do with the decision and said it wasn't an exoneration. Instead, he said another trial wouldn't be \"just or fair\" because a wrong was done by his predecessors who withheld the key evidence.",
      "Since taking office in 2017, Dupree said his office has increased training on fairness and is nearly done digitizing thousands of old cases. That is a key step in a $1.7 million effort to look for potential misconduct in the cases involving Golubski and others.",
      "\"It's not about getting the conviction. It's about getting a just outcome and doing what is right,\" Dupree said.",

    "published": "Thu, 12 Dec 2024 10:47:00 -0500",
    "summary": "\"These actions represent the largest single-day grant of clemency in modern history,\" the White House said.",
    "story": [
      "President Biden is commuting the sentences of nearly 1,500 people who were released from prison and placed on home confinement during the coronavirus pandemic and is pardoning 39 Americans convicted of nonviolent crimes. It's the largest single-day act of clemency in modern history.",
      "The White House has not released the names of those who received relief.",
      "The commutations announced Thursday are for people who have served out home confinement sentences for at least one year after they were released. Prisons were uniquely bad for spreading the virus and some inmates were released in part to stop the spread. At one point, 1 in 5 prisoners had COVID-19, according to a tally kept by The Associated Press.",
      "\"These actions represent the largest single-day grant of clemency in modern history,\" the White House said.",
      "Mr. Biden said he would be taking more steps in the weeks ahead and would continue to review clemency petitions. The second largest single-day act of clemency was by Barack Obama, with 330, shortly before he left office in 2017.",
      "\"America was built on the promise of possibility and second chances,\" Mr. Biden said in a statement. \"As president, I have the great privilege of extending mercy to people who have demonstrated remorse and rehabilitation, restoring opportunity for Americans to participate in daily life and contribute to their communities, and taking steps to remove sentencing disparities for non-violent offenders, especially those convicted of drug offenses.\"",
      "The clemency follows a broad pardon for his son Hunter, who was prosecuted for gun and tax crimes, criticizing the Justice Department's handling of his son's case in his statement explaining the pardon. The president had previously said he would not pardon Hunter. One of Mr. Biden's closest allies, former top aide Anita Dunn, said she agreed with his decision to pardon Hunter but she criticized the way in which the pardon happened.",
      "\"I do not agree with the way it was done, I don't agree with the timing, and I don't agree, frankly, with the attack on our judicial system,\" Dunn said at The New York Times' annual DealBook summit.",
      "Mr. Biden is under pressure from advocacy groups to pardon broad swaths of people, including those on federal death row, before the Trump administration takes over in January. He's also weighing whether to issue preemptive pardons to those who investigated Trump's effort to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and are facing possible retribution when he takes office.",
      "Those pardoned Thursday had been convicted of nonviolent crimes such as drug offenses and turned their lives around, White House lawyers said. They include a woman who led emergency response teams during natural disasters; a church deacon who has worked as an addiction counselor and youth counselor; a doctoral student in molecular biosciences; and a decorated military veteran.",
      "The president had previously issued 122 commutations and 21 other pardons. He's also broadly pardoned those convicted of use and simple possession of marijuana on federal lands and in the District of Columbia, and pardoned former U.S. service members convicted of violating a now-repealed military ban on consensual gay sex.",
      "Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts and 34 other lawmakers are urging the president to pardon environmental and human rights lawyer Steven Donziger, who was imprisoned or under house arrest for three years because of a contempt of court charge related to his work representing Indigenous farmers in a lawsuit against Chevron.",
      "Others are advocating for Mr. Biden to commute the sentences of federal death row prisoners. His attorney general, Merrick Garland, paused federal executions. Mr. Biden had said on the campaign trail in 2020 that he wanted to end the death penalty but he never did, and now, with Trump coming back into office, it's likely executions will resume. During his first term, Trump presided over an unprecedented number of federal executions, carried out during the height of the pandemic.",
      "More pardons are coming before Mr. Biden leaves office on Jan. 20, but it's not clear whether he'll take action to guard against possible prosecution by Trump, an untested use of the power.",
      "\"My administration will continue reviewing clemency petitions to advance equal justice under the law, promote public safety, support rehabilitation and reentry, and provide meaningful second chances,\" Mr. Biden said in a statement.",
      "The president has been taking the idea seriously and has been thinking about it for as much as six months - before the presidential election - but has been concerned about the precedent it would set, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions.",
      "But those who received the pardons would have to accept them. New California Sen. Adam Schiff, who was the chairman of the congressional committee that investigated the violent Jan. 6 insurrection, said such a pardon from Mr. Biden would be \"unnecessary,\" and that the president shouldn't be spending his waning days in office worrying about this.",
      "A president has the power to both pardon, in which a person is relieved of guilt and punishment, or commute a sentence, which reduces or eliminates the punishment but doesn't exonerate the wrongdoing. It's customary for a president to grant mercy at the end of his term, using the power of the office to wipe away records or end prison terms.",
      "Before pardoning his son, Mr. Biden had repeatedly pledged not to do so. He said in a statement explaining his reversal that the prosecution had been poisoned by politics. The decision prompted criminal justice advocates and lawmakers to put additional public pressure on the administration to use that same power for everyday Americans. It wasn't a very popular move; only about 2 in 10 Americans approved of his decision, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "\"The President's categorical approach to clemency has also inspired leaders across the country to take similar action,\" the White House said Thursday. \"Over ten states and localities, including Maryland and Massachusetts, have issued categorical clemency for marijuana convictions, impacting hundreds of thousands of people and allowing individuals to move past their convictions and move on with their daily lives.\"",

    "summary": "In some U.S. states, more than 40% of residents report having to cut back on basic necessities to afford their electricity bill, survey finds.",
    "story": [
      "With the\u00a0cost of things\u00a0like food and housing still straining people's budgets, many U.S. households over the past year have found themselves having to pare their spending on basic necessities just to keep the lights on at home.",
      "That's according to a recent Lending Tree study which analyzed U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey data from Aug. 20, 2024 to Sep. 16, 2024 to find the percentage of Americans 18 and older that had cut back on necessary expenses to pay their energy bill, kept their home at an unsafe or unhealthy temperature, or was unable to pay the full amount on an energy bill at least once over the preceding 12 months.",
      "The study found that more than 34% of respondents said they have had to cut back or skip spending on certain necessary expenses at least once over the past year in order to pay their energy bill.",
      "\"Even though inflation has moderated in recent months, life is still crazy-expensive, and that can make it hard to pay your bills,\" Matt Schulz, LendingTree chief credit analyst, said in the report. \"Lots of people have found themselves needing to make difficult decisions to keep the lights on. For some, that might mean cutting back on some expenses. For others, it might mean getting a side hustle or a second job.\"",
      "Electricity prices are on the rise. Is it inflation or an underlying issue?Hotter temperatures mean higher utility costs for millions of Americans",
      "Electricity prices are on the rise. Is it inflation or an underlying issue?",
      "Hotter temperatures mean higher utility costs for millions of Americans",
      "Hotter temperatures mean higher utility costs for millions of Americans",
      "Not surprisingly, households in poorer states are having a harder time keeping up with their electricity bill. In Alabama and Mississippi, more than 44% of residents reported having to make sacrifices to pay their utility bill, according to LendingTree. Eight of the top 11 states with the highest percentage of people struggling to pay energy bills are in the South, according to the report.",
      "\"Southern states tend to be low-income states, which means that each month can be a struggle,\" Schulz said. \"Add in that these are also low credit score states, and the predicament gets tougher.\"",
      "Adding to people's struggle is the rising cost of utilities. On average, in August Americans spent an average of $185.59 on electricity bills, according to LendingTree, a 2.6% increase from $180.82 in the same month a year ago. That said, residents in states with the highest energy rates don't necessarily pay the highest average monthly bills, according to the report, which found notable disparities in energy usage.",
      "For instance, Arizona, which has an average electricity rate of 42.10 cents per kilowatt-hour, or 14.7% below the national average of 16.63 cents, still has the second highest average monthly bill at $254.47, according to the report. Connecticut, which only has the third-highest electricity rate at 29.93 cents, or 109.7% above the national average, has the highest average monthly bill in the country, $254.47.",
      "Schulz expects both power costs and usage to continue increasing.",
      "\"For one, climate change and the\u00a0extreme weather that can come along with it may lead to greater usage, both in the heat of summer and the cold of winter,\" he said. \"Also, many utility companies are seeking to raise their rates in response to growing demand and other issues, and they're getting their way in many cases. It all adds up to some challenges for people with tight budgets.\"",

Lee disappeared and his body has never been found, but a judge declared him dead.",
      "Jurors said they were unable to reach a verdict after over nine and a half hours of deliberation. They had been instructed to find Herrington guilty of either capital murder, first-degree murder, second-degree murder, or manslaughter by culpable negligence, or find him not guilty, CBS affiliate WREG reported. The judge said another venue may be needed for Herrington's new trial, according to the station.",
      "Herrington, 24, showed little emotion as he left the courtroom with his attorneys and several relatives. He remains free on bond and is still charged with capital murder, which Mississippi law defines as a killing committed along with another felony \u2014 in this case, kidnapping. Prosecutors had said they would not seek the death penalty. He faces life in prison if he is tried again and convicted.",
      "Jurors on Wednesday were told they could also consider lesser charges of first-degree murder, punishable by life in prison; second-degree murder, 20 years to life; or manslaughter, up to 20 years.",
      "Circuit Judge Kelly Luther said he will consult with prosecutors and defense attorneys about setting another trial.",
      "Both Herrington and Lee had graduated from the University of Mississippi. Lee, 20, was pursuing a master's degree. He was known for his creative expression through fashion and makeup and often performed in drag shows in Oxford, according to a support group called Justice for Jay Lee.",
      "Lee disappeared July 8, 2022, in Oxford, where the university is located and the trial was held.",
      "Police arrested Herrington two weeks after Lee vanished. Investigators testified that they used warrants to obtain electronic records including explicit messages between social media accounts belonging to the two men and online searches conducted by Herrington, including one inquiring how long it takes to strangle someone.",
      "Prosecutors said during closing arguments Wednesday that Herrington and Lee had a sexual encounter that ended badly and Lee left Herrington's apartment. They said text messages showed that Herrington, who was not openly gay, persuaded Lee to return with the promise of more sex. Prosecutors said Lee was killed after going back.",
      "\"Tim Herrington lived a lie \u2014 lived a lie to his family,\" District Attorney Ben Creekmore said. \"He lied to Jay Lee to coax him over there, promising to do something with him.\"",
      "Herrington's attorney, Kevin Horan, has said prosecutors cannot prove Lee is dead without having a body. He told jurors Wednesday that text messages showed Herrington did not lure Lee to his apartment.",
      "\"He's the one that's being dominant anchoring this particular conversation,\" Horan said of Lee.",
      "Lee, 20, has not contacted friends or family, and his financial transactions and once-prolific social media posts have stopped since the day he disappeared, investigators testified.",
      "Police arrested Herrington two weeks after Lee went missing. Authorities interviewed Herington twice that day, and he gave conflicting information about the hours before Lee vanished, Oxford Police Chief Jeff McCutchen testified Tuesday.",
      "Before officers interviewed Herrington, they had already obtained explicit messages exchanged between social media accounts belonging to Herrington and Lee during the final hours Lee was known to be alive, McCutchen said.",
      "Google records obtained through a warrant showed that Herrington searched \"how long does it take to strangle someone\" at 5:56 a.m., University Police Department Sgt. Benjamin Douglas testified last week.",
      "The final text message from Lee's phone was sent to a social media account belonging to Herrington at 6:03 a.m. from a spot near Herrington's apartment, McCutchen said Tuesday. A cellphone tower in another part of Oxford last located any signal from Lee's phone shortly before 7:30 a.m., the police chief said. A security camera showed Herrington moments later jogging out of a parking lot where Lee's car was abandoned, investigators testified earlier.",
      "On the day Lee vanished, Herrington was also seen on security cameras buying duct tape in Oxford and driving to his own hometown of Grenada about an hour south of Oxford, police have testified.",
      "Herrington's relatives sat behind him in the courtroom, and Lee's sat behind prosecutors. When Luther dismissed court after the mistrial, he instructed the two groups to leave separately.",
      "Jurors were chosen from another county about 250 miles to the south. They heard eight days of arguments and testimony.",
      "The judge twice urged jurors to continue deliberating when they said they were deadlocked. After the third such message, Luther declared the mistrial and thanked them for serving, adding: \"I've asked a lot of you.\"",

      "The United Kingdom indefinitely extended a ban on puberty blockers for people younger than 18, barring medication prescriptions used to treat gender dysphoria, the government announced this week. There will be exemptions for people who choose to participate in a clinical trial aiming to study the safety and effectiveness of puberty suppression, which is set to begin next year. Young people already prescribed puberty blockers are allowed to continue taking them, the government said.",

In March, Britain's National Health Service stopped routine prescriptions of puberty blocking drugs to children and teenagers under 18 at clinics, in response to a landmark review of the country's approach to gender identity in health care.",

      "A man identifying himself as an American from Missouri, Travis Timmerman, was found Thursday in Syria after he said he was freed from a prison earlier in the week, when longtime dictator Bashar al-Assad was forced from power by a shock rebel offensive.",
      "Timmerman told CBS News senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer that he had been trying to make his own way out of the country after walking out of the prison where he'd been held for more than half of a year. He said he was detained upon entering Syria without permission seven months ago after spending a month in neigboring Lebanon.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News the government was aware of the reports that an American had been found outside Damascus and that it was seeking to provide support, but the official declined to provide any further detail out of respect for his privacy.",
      "Timmerman said two men armed with AK-47s broke his prison door down Monday with a hammer.",
      "\"My door was busted down, it woke me up,\" Timmerman said. \"I thought the guards were still there, so I thought the warfare could have been more active than it ended up being\u2026 Once we got out, there was no resistance, there was no real fighting.\"",
      "Timmerman said he had gone to Syria for Christian \"spiritual purposes\" and that his experience in prison \"wasn't too bad.\"",
      "\"I was never beaten. The only really bad part was that I couldn't go to the bathroom when I wanted to. I was only let out three times a day to go to the bathroom,\" he said.",
      "Timmerman said he left the prison with a large group and started walking away. He said he had been trying to head toward Jordan.",
      "He said he \"had a few moments of fear,\" when he left the prison, and hadn't really processed that he was free.",
      "\"I still haven't really thought about that. I've been more worried about finding a place to sleep each night since then,\" he told CBS News. \"So I've been working, really.\"",
      "Timmerman said he hadn't been afraid to approach people to ask for help or a place to sleep at night on his journey.",
      "\"They were coming to me, mostly,\" Timmerman said, adding that he'd spoken with his family three weeks ago, through a phone that he had while in prison. He said he had been allowed to use it.",
      "\"I'm feeling well. I've been fed and I've been watered, so I'm feeling well,\" Timmerman said.",

    "story": [
      "Soccer's international governing body FIFA confirmed Wednesday the locations for the next two men's World Cups, announcing Spain, Portugal and Morocco as joint hosts for the 2030 tournament, with games played in Uruguay, Paraguay and Argentina. FIFA also announced Saudi Arabia as the host for the 2034 World Cup.",
      "The consideration and now announcement of Saudi Arabia as a host has prompted backlash from rights groups due to the country's human rights record.",
      "\"FIFA is willfully blind to the country's human rights record, setting up a decade of potentially horrific human rights abuses preparing for the 2034 World Cup,\" Minky Worden, director of global initiatives at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement in November.",
      "Saudi Arabia's human rights record",
      "Rights groups point to evidence that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS, has presided over numerous documented cases of torture, mass executions and forced disappearances. Domestic criticism of the state, even on social media, has been met with imprisonment and torture.",
      "The CIA concluded with \"high confidence\" that MBS had personally ordered the 2018 assassination and dismemberment of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi at a Saudi diplomatic office in Turkey.",
      "The kingdom has recently made massive investments in global sports, drawing accusations of \"sportswashing\"\u00a0\u2014 the use of athletes and games to mask repression and authoritarian rule by \"laundering\" the image of a country.",
      "Concerns over 2034 World Cup",
      "According to Human Rights Watch, Saudi Arabia's hosting documents show it plans extensive construction work to prepare for the World Cup, including 11 new and refurbished stadiums, over 185,000 new hotel rooms and the expansion of other infrastructure including airports and roads.",
      "\"Saudi Arabia's massive infrastructure deficit will rest entirely on the backs of migrant workers building it,\" Human Rights Watch said in a report, adding that an independent analysis commissioned by the Saudi Arabia Football Federation as part of its FIFA bid was \"embarrassingly inadequate.\"",
      "Human Rights Watch, along with 10 other rights groups and labor organizations including Amnesty International and Football Supporters Europe, wrote to the law firm that produced the report for the Saudi federation to voice their concerns. Human Rights Watch said there was no meaningful response from the firm.",
      "\"Not a single migrant worker, victim of human rights crimes, torture survivor, jailed women's rights advocate, or Saudi civil society member was consulted for FIFA's supposedly independent report,\" Worden said. \"FIFA's treatment of the Saudi bid is an abysmal failure to implement mandatory human rights risk assessments and protections for the millions of migrant workers who are going to make the 2034 World Cup possible.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 12 Dec 2024 05:29:20 -0500",
    "summary": "The Georgian government's move away from the European Union and closer to Russia is fueling daily protests. Here's why it matters.",
    "story": [
      "Live television coverage showed police in the former Soviet republic of Georgia beating and arresting an opposition leader last week during a raid on his party's offices. The scenes played out on the 10th day of violent clashes in capital city Tbilisi between police and protesters furious about the Georgian president's decision to put talks on joining the European Union on hold.",
      "The unrest that erupted two weeks ago, after months of public frustration over Georgia's future, has caused significant casualties and seen more than 400 people arrested.",
      "Over 100 people have been hospitalized with injuries sustained during clashes with riot police, but the protesters continue taking to the streets of Tbilisi by their thousands every night.",
      "As the protests continue, there's concern the political crisis could escalate into more widespread violence, and there's also concern that a key U.S. partner on the far eastern edge of Europe could shift its political tendencies away from the democratic West and toward Moscow \u2014 whether or not its people agree with the move. Below is a look at what led to the unrest, and why the political crisis in the country that straddles Europe and Asia matters to the wider world.",
      "What led to the protests in Georgia?",
      "The protests have been driven largely by what many Georgians see as the governing Georgian Dream party's increasing authoritarian tendencies. In power since 2012, the ruling party led by billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili initially promised democratic reforms and closer ties with Europe and the West, including the EU.",
      "Critics argue that over time, the party has shifted toward Russia, undermining many Georgians' aspirations to see their country join the EU.",
      "The government's decision to freeze EU accession talks, and before that, to adopt a controversial \"foreign agents\" bill similar to legislation in Russia, were both seen as clear evidence of that shift to the east by Georgia's ruling party. There were previous protests over the new law as it went through the approval process, with many fearing it will stifle civil society and media freedom in the country.",
      "The situation deteriorated in November following allegations of voter suppression and election fraud in parliamentary elections. The post-election protests, which grew in size and intensity, were fueled by opposition claims that the government was manipulating the democratic process.",
      "President Salome Zurabishvili, an independent politician, has been among the most vocal critics of the ruling Georgian Dream party over alleged election interference, calling the recent vote a \"total fraud.\" According to the Reuters news agency, two international polling groups from the U.S. agreed with that assessment, calling the results statistically impossible.",
      "On Dec. 3, the country's Constitutional Court rejected Zurabishvili's call to annul the parliamentary election results, further exacerbating the tension on the streets. On the ninth day of the protests she called the actions of the police gross violations of human rights in her post on X.",
      "Georgia's relationship with Russia",
      "The protests in Georgia have highlighted the country's complex, fraught relationship with its much larger neighbor to the north, Russia.",
      "Russia invaded Georgia in 2008\u00a0and it continues to occupy the regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.",
      "Russia firmly opposes Georgia's aspirations to join both the EU and the U.S.-led NATO military alliance, and it has leveraged both its economic and political influence to try to prevent the country from aligning with the Western institutions.",
      "In an interview with 60 Minutes earlier this year President Zurabishvili called Russia's subtle, yet impactful bid to influence Georgian politics part of a \"hybrid war\" being waged by Moscow against the West.",
      "She said Russia's tactics included spreading disinformation, exerting economic pressure and manipulating internal politics to prevent Georgia from fully integrating with its European neighbors to the west.",
      "Critics, including the president, highlight the recent adoption of the foreign agents law, which requires all non-profit organizations and media outlets that receive foreign funding to register as \"foreign agents\" in Georgia, as an example of the ruling party dragging the country closer to Russia's authoritarian model.",
      "Similar laws in Russia, enacted since Vladimir Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, have been used to curb dissent and limit political freedom.",
      "Critics argue that the law represents a major setback for democratic reforms set in motion when Georgia gained its independence from the former Soviet Union, and it was always seen as a significant hurdle to EU membership.",
      "LGBTQ rights in Georgia have also been a contentious issue, with the ruling party and influential religious groups often opposing reforms. Discrimination against LGBTQ people remains widespread, and pride marches are regularly met with violent counterprotests.",
      "The social divide is another point of tension, as many pro-European activists see the protection of minority rights as an essential part of Georgia's future in the EU.",
      "Why does Georgia's political crisis matter to the U.S.?",
      "Georgia's political unrest has important implications for both the European Union and NATO, with Western capitals worried that a move toward Russia and its style of authoritarianism could embolden Moscow as it tries to curb Western influence across the continent.",
      "Georgia has been a critical partner to the U.S. in the South Caucasus region, which straddles the border between Eastern Europe and Asia. If Georgia's government continues shifting its alignment toward Russia, it could undermine U.S. influence.",
      "\"Political crisis in Georgia is a significant challenge for the West,\" Royal United Services Institute associate fellow Natia Seskuria told CBS News. \"Georgia has remained one of the most pro-Western countries in the region, with an overwhelming majority of the population supporting the country's integration into the EU and NATO.\"",
      "Seskuria said the lack of any significant international response to the unrest was likely deepening and prolonging the crisis.",
      "The U.S. State Department suspended its strategic partnership with Georgia at the end of November, citing the country's shift away from European integration.",
      "\"The Georgian people overwhelmingly support integration with Europe,\" the State Department said when it suspended the partnership, adding a condemnation of \"the excessive use of force by police against Georgians seeking to exercise their rights to assembly and expression, including their freedom to peacefully protest.\u00a0 We call on all sides to ensure protests remain peaceful.\"",
      "Seskuria said all eyes in Georgia were on the incoming Trump administration, with many wondering how it might approach the country's political tumult given Mr. Trump's previous remarks praising President Vladimir Putin.",
      "President Zurabishvili, speaking to 60 Minutes in June, expressed her frustration with what she deemed lackluster U.S. support for the peaceful protests against Russian-sympathetic political\u00a0 forces in her country.",
      "\"I think that some more public recognition is needed,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "A male humpback whale made one of the longest and most unusual migrations on record for the species, an anomaly scientists say might be linked to climate change.",
      "The whale was first sighted in waters off northwestern Colombia in July 2013, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal\u00a0Royal Society Open Science on the creature's movements and how to potentially explain them. Authors said that same whale was seen again four years later, in another spot off the Colombian coast about 50 miles away from the location of the first sighting.",
      "An unlikely third encounter with the humpback happened in August 2022, when it was spotted off eastern Africa in a channel between Zanzibar and mainland Tanzania. The whale would have had to cross multiple oceans and travel more than 8,000 miles from the Colombian Pacific to get there, and experts believe it was trying to find a mate or food. The whale's lengthy voyage set a record for the longest known migration between breeding grounds.",
      "Sightings were tracked through photographs submitted by citizen scientists to happywhale.com, where marine enthusiasts, researchers and other professionals plot the locations and movements of whales worldwide.",
      "Though humpbacks are among several species of whales known to\u00a0migrate extraordinarily long distances\u00a0each year to pursue sources of food in colder waters and breed in tropical seas, the study's authors called the humpback's behavior \"atypical.\" This whale's crusade dwarfed even the longest transits reported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which notes in a description of humpback whales shared on its site that some populations are known to migrate as far as 5,000 miles in a single year.",
      "The study said the long-distance movement was peculiar \"and raises the question as to what its drivers are, which could include but not necessarily be limited to mating strategies.\"",
      "The whale's penchant to explore an unexpected and faraway habitat could also have been rooted in environmental shifts caused by climate change, the authors said. Things like higher sea surface temperatures are impacting marine life around the world and could similarly affect distributions of krill in certain areas, which could in turn affect feeding grounds for humpbacks like the long-distance traveler.",
      "Their study did note that more research is necessary to arrive at any conclusions about the whale's migration pattern.",
      "\"On the other hand, population increases may also be a driver of these breeding ground shifts, when animals may need to explore new breeding and/or feeding areas due to competition from larger, more established males in both areas,\" the authors wrote. \"The exact cause or drivers of these breeding habitat shifts can only be speculated due to the current limited data availability on humpback whale behavioural ecology.\"",

    "summary": "The secretary of state's testimony comes months after Republicans issued a scathing report on the Biden administration's handling of the exit from Afghanistan.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday defended President Biden's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan while appearing before the Republican-led House Foreign Affairs Committee, which has long sought to question him over the deadly evacuation.",
      "\"I firmly believe the president's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan was the right one,\" he told lawmakers.",
      "Blinken declined to take the blame for decisions that were made leading up to the exit, explaining that actions taken by the first Trump administration left the Biden administration in a weak position and intelligence assessments expected Kabul to remain the hands of the Afghan government.",
      "Blinken's testimony came nearly three months after the committee\u00a0voted\u00a0along party lines to recommend that the nation's top diplomat be held in contempt of Congress amid a standoff over his appearance before the panel to discuss its investigation into the\u00a02021 withdrawal.",
      "The committee and State Department had been at odds for months, leading Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the Republican chairman, to issue multiple subpoenas for Blinken to testify in September. McCaul said Blinken's appearance was important as the committee considers \"potential legislation aimed at helping prevent the catastrophic mistakes of the withdrawal.\"",
      "The Afghanistan hearing",
      "\"Tragically, more than three years after this administration's disastrous withdrawal, you're finally here to take responsibility,\" McCaul said Wednesday, also accusing Blinken in the lead up to the evacuation of denying \"imminent and dangerous threats to American interests, American citizens and our decade long Afghan partners, all the while, the Taliban captured province after province on their march to Kabul.\"",
      "Republicans on the committee released a lengthy report in September that detailed their yearslong investigation into the chaotic exit from Afghanistan and accused the Biden administration of misleading the public about the end of the 20-year war.",
      "Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the committee, on Wednesday called the report \"partisan and misleading\" and said Republicans have \"muddled the facts\" about whether a suicide bombing that killed 13 U.S. service members was preventable.",
      "Blinken, whose opening statement was repeatedly disrupted by protesters, acknowledged the service members who died and their families, saying he deeply regretted that the U.S. \"did not do more and could not do more to protect them.\"",
      "\"To the extent President Biden faced a choice, it was between ending the war or escalating it,\" Blinken said. \"In the three years since the end of our country's longest war. All of us, including myself, have wrestled with what we could have done differently during that period and over the proceeding two decades.\"",
      "Blinken also acknowledged that the Taliban was not in compliance with a deal the Trump administration struck with the group to withdraw U.S. forces from the country by May 2021. The deal, known as the Doha Agreement, laid out a series of conditions for the Taliban to fulfill in order for U.S. forces to fully leave Afghanistan.",
      "\"The Taliban was in violation of the Doha Agreement in a number of ways,\" he said. \"It was in violation when the previous administration drew down forces repeatedly. It was in violation during the time that we were in office before the evacuation.\"",
      "According to Blinken, the Biden administration unsuccessfully tried to get the Taliban to abide by the conditions and negotiate with the Afghan government.",
      "\"They didn't do that,\" he said. \"But because we had the deadline, and because we had the prospect of the Taliban resuming attacks on U.S. forces, which would have required us to put tens of thousands of Americans back into Afghanistan, we followed through with pulling them out.\"",
      "He said the Doha Agreement \"created a tremendous crisis in confidence\" in the Afghan government. The Afghan government was excluded from the Trump administration's negotiations with the Taliban that led to the agreement.",
      "Blinken said he was on the phone with then-Afghan President Ashraf Ghani the night before he fled the country as the Taliban closed in.",
      "\"He told me that he wanted to continue working on getting an agreement with the Taliban, but if he couldn't, he would stay and fight to the death,\" Blinken said. \"And he left the next day.\"",
      "Though the U.S. tried to get in contact with every U.S. citizen in the Afghanistan, Blinken said, hundreds who wanted to leave the country did not make it out before the withdrawal. As of now, \"every American who identified themselves and said that they wanted to leave has been given an opportunity to do so,\" he said. But some returned after the withdrawal and have been detained, he said.",
      "\"We are working every day to get them out, to get them back,\" he said.",
      "The committee's report",
      "During its investigation, the committee conducted 18 transcribed interviews with Biden administration officials and received more than 20,000 pages of documents from the State Department, some of which were obtained through subpoenas. Blinken was not among those who testified for the report, but the State Department noted amid the standoff with the committee that he has testified to Congress on Afghanistan more than 14 times.",
      "The report accused President Biden and his administration of ignoring repeated warnings from military officials, national security advisers and U.S. allies about the risks of removing all American forces from Afghanistan, saying Mr. Biden \"prioritized politics and his personal legacy over America's national security interests.\"",
      "Blinken was among those faulted in the report, which said he \"remained largely absent throughout the State Department's withdrawal planning\" and the evacuation.",
      "\"Indeed, witnesses interviewed, and documents produced by federal agencies pursuant to the investigation, confirm Secretary Blinken likely ceded his responsibility to subordinates on Afghanistan,\" the report said.",
      "Blinken advocated for the U.S. Embassy in Kabul to remain open regardless of the military withdrawal, according to the report, which said that the desire to maintain a diplomatic presence contributed to the State Department's \"lack of urgency and their delays in planning for the worst-case scenarios.\"",
      "The report also noted that diplomatic officials on the ground expressed concerns about the commitment to keep the embassy open despite the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan, culminating in a July 2021 dissent cable warning that Kabul would fall after the planned withdrawal. Two weeks before the U.S. troops left Afghanistan, State Department leaders agreed to shutter the embassy, the report said.",
      "Republicans threatened to hold Blinken in contempt of Congress in 2023 as they sought to review the classified dissent cable. The State Department eventually allowed lawmakers to view a partially redacted version.",
      "\"You personally read this, sir,\" McCaul said while questioning Blinken on Wednesday. \"Why did you ignore the cries for help? Why did you leave the embassy open?\"",
      "McCaul also said it appeared that Blinken delegated his responsibility and pressed him on who was calling the shots.",
      "\"To legislate moving forward, I need to know who was in charge,\" McCaul said, calling on Mr. Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan to testify to the committee.",
      "About 20 minutes later, McCaul announced that Sullivan had agreed to testify on Tuesday.",
      "Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee accused Republicans of politicizing the withdrawal and said the majority took \"particular pains to avoid facts involving former President Donald Trump.\"",
      "Last year, the White House released its own 12-page summary of a classified review of the Afghanistan exit that largely blamed the Trump administration for the Doha Agreement. Another report partially declassified and released by the State Department last year faulted both the Trump and Biden administrations for \"insufficient\" planning surrounding the withdrawal.",

      "A shipwreck dating back to the 5th and 6th centuries B.C. was discovered near Sicily along with ancient anchors made from stone and iron, Italian officials said.",
      "The 2,500-year-old wreck was found buried beneath sand and rocks by crews working on an underwater excavation project in the waters of Santa Maria del Focallo, near Ispica at the southern tip of the Italian island,\u00a0said\u00a0Sicily's Superintendent of the Sea in a statement Monday.",
      "When archaeologists unearthed the sunken ship, they discovered a hull built using an \"on-the-shell\" construction technique, a simplistic early shipbuilding method often traced to populations around the Mediterranean. They also found a trove of anchors several feet from the wreckage, the superintendent said, two of the anchors were made from iron and likely originated in the 7th century A.D. The other four anchors, which were made from heavy stone, probably date back to the prehistoric era.",
      "RITROVATO UN RELITTO ARCAICO NELLE ACQUE DI SANTA MARIA DEL FOCALLO\nUN\u2019IMPORTANTE SCOPERTA ARCHEOLOGICA CHE TESTIMONIA I...",
      "Archaeologists created a three-dimensional model of the shipwreck and collected samples from the artifacts for analysis, hoping to understand more about the materials that compose them.",
      "\"This discovery represents an extraordinary contribution to the knowledge of the maritime history of Sicily and the Mediterranean and highlights once again the central role of the Island in the traffic and cultural exchanges of antiquity,\" said Francesco Paolo Scarpinato, Sicily's regional councilor for cultural heritage and Sicilian identity, in a translated statement on the shipwreck published\u00a0by the University of Udine. \"The wreck, dating back to a crucial period for the transition between archaic and classical Greece, is a precious piece of the submerged Sicilian cultural heritage.\"",
      "The three-week excavation in Santa Maria del Focallo, which was part of the Kaukana Project, an archaeological research initiative, ended in September, but officials did not share their findings until this week. The superintendent of the sea led the initiative with archaeologists from the University of Udine, near the site of the excavation.",
      "Those involved with the project say this wreck could potentially shine a light on an important chapter of ancient Greece, which occupied Sicily for hundreds of years until the island was taken by Rome around 200 B.C.",
      "Massimo Capulli,\u00a0a coordinator of the Kaukana Project\u00a0and professor at the University of Udine, added in a separate statement released by the university that studying the wreck may help illuminate how trade happened between ancient Greeks and Carthaginians, two groups that thousands of years ago fought for control of the seas around present-day Sicily.",
      "\"We are in fact faced with material evidence of the traffic and trade of a very ancient era,\" Capulli said.",

      "Haqqani was the brother of Jalaluddin Haqqani, the late founder of the notorious Haqqani network. The closely affiliated group was responsible for some of the most violent attacks during the Taliban's two-decade insurgency in the wake of the U.S.-led 2001 invasion to topple the previous Taliban government.

      "\"Italian tourism is under attack. The 2026 Milan-Cortina Olympics and the 2025 Jubilee whet the appetites of the mafia,\" Demoskopika president Raffaele Rio said in a report.",

    "story": [
      "Seoul, South Korea\u00a0\u2014 South Korea's previous defense minister was stopped from attempting suicide while in detention over last week's martial law declaration, officials said Wednesday, as President Yoon Suk Yeol's office resisted a police attempt to search the compound.",
      "The main liberal opposition Democratic Party is pushing for a new motion to impeach Yoon for his Dec. 3 decree that imposed martial law in South Korea for the first time in more than four decades. Its first impeachment attempt against Yoon last Saturday failed after ruling party lawmakers boycotted the vote. The party said it plans to submit the new motion on Thursday to set up another vote this Saturday.",
      "Yoon's ill-conceived power grab has paralyzed South Korean politics, frozen its foreign policy and rattled financial markets. On Wednesday, rival North Korea's state media for the first time reported about the turmoil across the border, but the country hasn't shown any suspicious activities.",
      "Shin Yong Hae, commissioner general of the Korea Correctional Service, told lawmakers that former Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun tried to kill himself the previous night at a detention center in Seoul. He said correctional officers stopped him and that he was in stable condition. Kim was arrested by prosecutors early Wednesday on allegations of playing a key role in a rebellion and committing abuse of power. He became the first person formally arrested over the martial law decree.",
      "Kim, one of Yoon's close associates, has been accused of recommending martial law to Yoon and sending troops to the National Assembly to block lawmakers from voting on it. Enough lawmakers eventually managed to enter a parliament chamber and they unanimously rejected Yoon's decree, forcing the Cabinet to lift it before daybreak on Dec. 4.",
      "Kim said in a statement on Tuesday that he \"deeply apologizes for causing significant anxiety\" to the public. He said all responsibility for the martial law imposition rests with him and pleaded for leniency for soldiers deployed to enforce it.",
      "Prosecutors have up to 20 days to determine whether to indict Kim.",
      "Later Wednesday, police detained National Police Agency Commissioner General Cho Ji Ho and Kim Bong-sik, head of Seoul's metropolitan police. They were accused of deploying police forces to parliament to block lawmakers from voting.",
      "The focus of the investigation is determining whether Yoon, Kim and others involved in imposing martial law committed the act of rebellion. A conviction for rebellion carries a maximum penalty of death in South Korea.",
      "South Korean police said they sent officers to search Yoon's office Wednesday to look for any evidence related to the martial law introduction. But investigators had failed to enter the office as of Wednesday evening, about six hours after their arrival, senior police officer Lee Ho-young told the parliament. Some observers earlier said the presidential security service was unlikely to permit any searches of Yoon's office, citing a law that prohibits searches of sites with state secrets without approval from those in charge of the areas in question.",
      "Yoon on Saturday apologized over the martial law decree, saying he wouldn't avoid legal or political responsibility for it. He said he would leave it to his party to chart a course through the country's political turmoil, \"including matters related to my term in office.\"",
      "The leader of Yoon's ruling party later vowed to arrange the president's stable exit from office, saying the party would coordinate with Cabinet members over state affairs and that Yoon would be sidelined from duties. The comments were criticized as unrealistic and unconstitutional, and caused widespread questions about who is in charge of South Korea and its military at a time of heightened tension with North Korea. The Justice Ministry on Tuesday banned Yoon from leaving the country as he faces investigations.",
      "Vice Defense Minister Kim Seon Ho reiterated Wednesday that Yoon remains in charge of the military. But Yoon hasn't been involved in any major official activities since lifting martial law, except for accepting resignation offers by officials involved in the martial law case and appointing the head for the country's Truth and Reconciliation Commission.",
      "A Wednesday article from the North's state news agency reported about the South Korean political chaos and protests triggered by Yoon's martial law decree. The report mostly attempted to explain the South Korean events, though it called Yoon \"a traitor\" and his military \"gangsters.\"",
      "Many experts say North Korea is sensitive to the domestic spread of news on major anti-government protests in foreign countries, because its own people have no official access to international news and could be affected by such events. The U.S. State Department said Monday that the U.S.-South Korean alliance remains \"iron-clad\" and that Washington is committed to the peace and security of the Korean Peninsula.",
      "In his martial law announcement, the conservative Yoon stressed a need to rebuild the country by eliminating \"shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces,\" a reference to his liberal rivals who control parliament. Since taking office in 2022, Yoon has had near-constant friction with the Democratic Party, which introduced motions to impeach some of his top officials and launched a political offensive over scandals involving Yoon and his wife.",
      "Opposition parties and many experts say the martial law decree was unconstitutional. They say a president is by law allowed to declare martial law only during wartime or similar emergency situations, but South Korea wasn't in such a predicament. They argue that deploying troops to seal the National Assembly to suspend its political activities amounted to rebellion because the constitution doesn't allow a president to use the military to suspend parliament in any situation.",
      "If Yoon is impeached, his presidential powers would be suspended until the Constitutional Court decides whether to restore his powers or remove him from office. If he is dismissed from office, a new presidential election would be required.",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 05:04:59 -0500",
    "summary": "The sound of a bottle popping may be a familiar harbinger of good, but the humble material behind the pop has more uses than you might imagine.",
    "story": [
      "Lisbon, Portugal \u2014\u00a0The sound of a cork popping out of the end of a bottle is known across the world. It often precedes moments of celebration, a shared meal or simply the quiet enjoyment of a glass of wine. But many who've taken part in the simple ritual may not realize that it's also a synonym for sustainability, natural wonder, and even human ingenuity.",
      "Cork, the humble material used for centuries to seal bottles, is a unique product not only for the way it's grown, but also for the plethora of inventive uses people have found for it \u2014 which go far beyond the ubiquitous bottle stoppers. Cork is used in everything from the building of spacecraft to the insulation of homes, and it can replace rubber or plastic on just about anything that needs protection from heat or vibration.",
      "Thanks to the unique, delicate conditions in which it grows, cork is also a powerful, natural carbon sink, meaning it absorbs harmful CO2 from the atmosphere and locks it away.",
      "CBS News visited the southern European nation of Portugal, which produces the majority of the world's cork, and met Ant\u00f3nio Rios Amorim, who humbly rejects the title \"King of Cork.\"",
      "\"I'm just inheriting a huge legacy from a family that, for the last 154 years, has been dedicating itself to cork, and really trying to develop this unique product to give it new life,\" he said.",
      "Amorim Cork produces more than five billion of the approximately 13 billion cork bottle stoppers produced annually across the globe. It's enough to give the family firm comfortable supremacy in the industry, but Amorim said finding new and innovative uses for the material, beyond sealing bottles, remained \"fundamental\" to his empire's future.",
      "Among the less-well-known applications \u2014 and one Amorim clearly relishes \u2014 is the use of cork on NASA rockets. The material is mixed into the heat shields that protect spacecraft as they leave and reenter the Earth's atmosphere.",
      "Its light weight, malleability and insulating properties against vibration have made the spongy material a natural choice for some of the most important space missions, including the Apollo missions and the Mars rovers. It's also used on Elon Musk's SpaceX rockets.",
      "\"It's remarkable,\" said Eduardo Soares, as he gave CBS News a tour of Amorim's eclectic showroom. \"Cork has this very peculiar effect, a slow burning process. It will absorb heat without transferring it.\"",
      "As head of the unit tasked with dreaming up new ways for Amorim to profit from cork that isn't suitable for bottle stoppers, Soares could easily identify every product in the room.",
      "Biodegradable cork granules replace rubber in artificial turf infill, which also helps keep surface temperatures down and avoids the release of microplastics; Insulation panels that absorb vibration, making train carriages quieter and smoother; Children's playground flooring, normally made of synthetic materials, now have a natural alternative.",
      "For Amorim, the list of alternative uses for cork seems endless.",
      "\"It's very important for us that we use the raw material that we take out from nature until the very last limit,\" Soares explained.",
      "Amorim is also part of a recycling initiative, aptly named The Cork Collective, that aims to help restaurants and hotels recycle the cork stoppers from bottles they open, to give the precious material a new lease of life.",
      "Another family-run business in the field is Sofalca, which specializes in turning cork into natural insulation for walls and floors.",
      "CEO Paulo Estrada gave CBS News a tour of his factory's autoclaves, affectionately nicknamed the \"popcorn makers,\" which cook granules of cork at high temperatures and under intense pressure. The cork expands, and its natural resin glues it all together without the need for added chemicals. A large block rolls off the assembly line, ready to be cut into slabs, shaped into enormous walls of art or even pieces of furniture.",
      "Estrada said the material can give an otherwise unassuming part of someone's home a \"contemplative effect.\"",
      "\"If you come near a cork wall, you will touch, smell and feel it. Nobody stays indifferent,\" he added.",
      "The desire by businesses to make the most out of every single ounce of the natural material can be explained by its biggest caveat: Cork is a layer of bark that grows only on the Quercus Suber oak tree. It typically takes 25 years from the moment a tree is planted for it to be ready for its first harvest. It then takes another nine years to regrow the bark.",
      "\"You have to be patient,\" said Casimiro Milheiras, taking a quick break from climbing up trees with a small axe. At 57, Milheiras is one of thousands of seasonal workers hired every summer to comb through Portugal's scorching Alentejo region to manually strip the bark off the Quercus oaks.",
      "\"It's almost an art form, so you only do this work if you really love it,\" he said.",
      "His 20 years of experience have taught him exactly how to strike the tree hard enough to pierce through the bark, but not so hard that he cuts into the trunk, as doing so would compromise the next harvest.",
      "The natural landscape cork comes from isn't just important for the industry, however. Environmental impact studies by international consulting firms EY and PricewaterhouseCoopers have demonstrated that many of Amorim's products are actually carbon negative, which means the overall process \u2014 from growth to extraction, transportation and production \u2014 absorbs more carbon than it emits into the environment.",
      "\"There is no best example of a carbon sink in a forest like the cork oak forest, because we don't cut the tree,\" explained Nuno Oliveira, \"we want them to grow [for] as long as possible.\"",
      "Oliveira is the director of Amorim's forestry division, which is responsible for the research and practices that keep its cork oak forests healthy. His work helps secure the future of both Portugal's cork industry, and the company.",
      "Standing in a field of planted cork oaks that were about 100 years old on average, Oliveira explained that as long as the trees keep growing and regrowing their precious bark, they will keep sucking carbon out of the air.",
      "His biggest challenge, he said, has been to find a way to shorten the time needed for a tree's first cork harvest from the current 25 years, to just 10, which CEO Amorim highlighted as one of the most \"fundamental\" questions his business needs to answer.",
      "\"This is a gift of nature,\" Amorim said. \"We need to consume products with a negative carbon footprint. That means we are going to have to plant a lot more cork trees, which at the end of the day will make us live in a much better world.\"",

    "summary": "The Arctic tundra has historically helped reduce global emissions. But rising temperatures and wildfires in the region are changing that, scientists say.",
    "story": [
      "Foreboding environmental milestones abounded again this year in the Arctic, where experts say dramatic climate shifts are fundamentally altering the ecosystem and how it operates. One recent turning point for the region involves its carbon footprint: Where conditions in the Arctic historically worked to reduce global emissions, they're now actively contributing to them.",
      "That's a major transition that could reap consequences on human, plant and animal life far beyond Earth's northernmost arena, warned a cohort of scientists whose research appears in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's 2024 Arctic Report Card, published Tuesday. The report is an annual assessment of the polar environment, which in recent years has become a stark alert signal marked by unprecedented and ominous observations all linked to rising temperatures from human-caused climate change.",
      "A focus of the latest Arctic evaluation was the effects of warmer weather and wildfires on the tundra, a far-northern biome that's typically known for extreme cold, little precipitation and a layer of permanently frozen soil, called permafrost, covering the land. Those traits collectively made the Arctic an important carbon sink for millennia, meaning the region essentially helped reduce carbon dioxide emissions worldwide by absorbing more carbon than it emitted into the atmosphere.",
      "That has mainly been due to carbon uptake from plants, which regulate atmospheric levels of the molecule through photosynthesis, and a storage process in the permafrost, which traps carbon dioxide in the ground. But warming air temperatures in the Arctic are breaking down permafrost across the tundra, in some cases, severely. The Arctic report, for example, showed Alaskan permafrost temperatures in 2024 were the second-warmest ever recorded. That causes the soil to heat up and thaw, its carbon repositories decompose along with it.",
      "Research included in NOAA's Arctic report shows carbon once stored in the tundra's permafrost is actually being released into the atmosphere. In parts of the region, it's happening at a rate that outweighs the carbon sink and instead creates a net increase in greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 something of particular concern to climate scientists at a time when pollution from fossil fuel production has already reached a record high.",
      "The same fossil fuels overwhelming the atmosphere and prompting ongoing admonition from top weather and climate officials\u00a0at the United Nations are fueling the emissions in the Arctic, said Rich Spinrad, the administrator of NOAA, in a statement on the new report's findings.",
      "\"Our observations now show that the Arctic tundra, which is experiencing warming and increased wildfire, is now emitting more carbon than it stores, which will worsen climate change impacts,\" Spinrad said. \"This is yet one more sign, predicted by scientists, of the consequences of inadequately reducing fossil fuel pollution.\"",
      "Wildfires in the Arctic have been raging at rates never seen before, and that alone drives up carbon emissions. Researchers suggest 2024 had the second-highest annual volume of wildfire emissions north of the Arctic Circle on record. Coupled with the release of carbon dioxide and methane gas from permafrost stores, they say net emissions could continue to increase in the place that climate change is heating up faster than anywhere else on the planet.",

      "Damascus \u2013 Syria's capital city was on auto-pilot Tuesday, with no new government in place in the wake of the dramatic rebel offensive that toppled longtime dictator Bashar al-Assad on Sunday. But as the former al-Qaeda offshoot that led that charge put some of its senior figures in charge of a self-declared transitional administration, many Syrians appeared determined to try to get on with business as usual.",
      "Some institutions, including Syria's central bank, asked employees to show up for work, and many people appeared to be hoping that just sticking to daily routines would prove the safest option in the face of complete uncertainty over the country's future.",
      "Some efforts are being made to quell concern. Mohamed al-Bashir, a politican who previously led local government in the parts of northwestern Syria and Idlib ruled by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, before its extraordinary 12-day lightening offensive, has been named a transitional prime minister for the next three months.",
      "And while there remains lingering anxiety, there was still an excited buzz, especially in the capital Damascus, which until Sunday was the seat of the Assad family's brutal grip on power for half a century. On Monday, crowds came to sightsee around one of the former dictator's houses and to get to know the Islamist fighters who swept into their city on Sunday.",
      "Those rebel forces, while patrolling the streets, were on their best behavior -\u2014 even allowing members of the public to hold their weapons for smiling photo opportunities.",
      "\"It's a celebration for all of us, for all the Syrians: here and all over the world,\" said Lina Zacchar, one of the many Syrians who came to take a look at the former president's family home. \"My mum is Christian, so she is afraid. But we are telling her... we hope for a new Syria. We are all brothers, we are all sisters, we are all one! We are Syrians.\"",
      "At another symbol of the regime, the presidential palace, members of the public walked the vast ceremonial rooms where the Assads once welcomed dignitaries.",
      "The idea of getting anywhere near the palace would have once been unimaginable for the general population. Now, its doors are wide open.  CBS News found the palace patrolled by a rebel soldier named Ahmed who had nearly been killed opposing Assad's forces nine years ago.",
      "\"I was personally targeted and I was wounded in a strike in 2015 on our home. My relatives are detained and I don't know their destiny,\" Ahmed told CBS News on Monday. \"They might be in the regime prisons and I hope we can release them from it.\"",
      "Ahmed \u2013 like all of the other rebel fighters \u2013  is waiting for new orders. There remains a huge question mark over HTS's efforts to gain political legitimacy, tarnished by a questioned human rights records in the areas of Syria in which it has governed, and lingering doubts about the faction's ability to heal the country's religious divides.",
      "Parts of the country also remains ravaged by war as Turkey-backed opposition fighters battle U.S.-allied Kurdish forces in the north, and the Islamic State group and its extremist ideology remains active in pockets of the country.",
      "As Syria undergoes a seismic transition, the country is in a historic, but still dangerous, moment.",

    "story": [
      "A Ukrainian man who embarked on a perilous journey fleeing his war-torn country into Romania was rescued from a deep mountain ravine in subzero temperatures with an unlikely companion: his months-old kitten named Peach.",
      "More than a dozen rescuers worked in a harsh blizzard to save Vladislav Duda, 28, who was found \"soaked and frozen\" and severely hypothermic in a 400-meter (437-yard) deep ravine in the northern Maramures region last week, according to the region's mountain rescue service. Duda had fled Ukraine to avoid being drafted into his country's armed forces fighting Russia.",
      "\"The cat was warm and was warming him \u2026 so he saved his life,\" Dan Benga, the director of the Maramures mountain rescue service, told The Associated Press. \"The only thing we saw he is caring about is the cat. He doesn't care about himself.\"",
      "When the rescue team located and found the Ukrainian, they unzipped his jacket and discovered Peach snuggled up inside. Benga recalls asking Duda if he was OK, to which he replied: \"I'm happy because my cat is alive. I got a chance from God for a new life. The happiest moment is because the cat is here with me,\" Benga recalled Duda saying.",
      "The auburn-colored kitten, a tomcat named \"Peach\" in Ukrainian, was experiencing the effects of malnutrition after they ran out of food four days earlier and melted snow helped to keep him alive.",
      "\"It's like a dream, after all I have been through, I only hoped to be found and to survive,\" Duda, who worked as a journalist in Ukraine, told the AP. \"Peach kept my heart warm and he kept my faith alive.\"",
      "A helicopter retrieval was initially launched but was aborted due to dangerous weather that hampered visibility. Ground rescuers then embarked on a grueling mission through deep snow and temperatures as low as minus 10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit) until they reached the pair.",
      "During the complex ascent out of the ravine which took more than five hours, the Ukrainian would not let go of his kitten. He kept Peach clutched to his chest \"from the bottom to the top ... until we put him in the ambulance,\" Benga said. \"He said only 'Please take care of the cat.'\"",
      "Close to getting frostbite, Duda is now receiving anti-inflammatory medication and blood circulation treatment, said Izabella Kiskasza, who runs a community center for Ukrainian refugees in Maramures and is assisting the duo. Peach received veterinary treatment in Baia Mare on Monday and is expected to fully recover.",
      "Duda left his home in Ukraine's war-ravaged Kharkiv region more than a week before getting stranded with his feline companion in the arching Carpathian Mountain range, which straddles northern Romania and southwest Ukraine.",
      "While Peach is the first feline rescued from the mountainous Romanian region, Duda is just one of many Ukrainian men who have risked their lives traversing the harsh conditions of the mountains to avoid being drafted into their country's grinding war with Russia.",
      "Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, more than 160 Ukrainian men have been rescued from Romania's Maramures region and the numbers have doubled each year since, Benga said. Another 16 have been found dead.",
      "Two other Ukrainian draft-aged men were rescued by helicopter the same day as Duda, he said.",
      "\"There are a lot of people who are coming, but they have no medical problem \u2026 and they don't call for help,\" Benga said. \"The people who are calling for help are in the last few hours of their life.\"",
      "Ukraine has taken steps to broaden its pool of draft-eligible men, but the efforts have only scratched the surface against a much larger Russian military. In April, Ukraine's parliament passed a law lowering its draft-eligible age for men from 27 to 25.",
      "Desertion is also starving the Ukrainian army of desperately needed manpower at a crucial time in its war with Russia. The U.S., which has also urged Ukraine to draft more troops, and allow for the conscription of those as young as 18, on Saturday announced a new $988 million military assistance package for Ukraine in its war with Russia as Washington races to provide aid to Kyiv before\u00a0President-elect Donald Trump takes office.",
      "\"What I remember is the fear of the unknown and the fear of not making it through the night alive,\" Duda recalled on Monday. \"My Peach kept me alive. When escaping we were afraid of everybody, not to be sent back to fight in a war that is not ours.\"",
      "According to the United Nations, there are nearly 4 million internally displaced people in Ukraine and 6.8 million refugees from Ukraine have been recorded globally as of November 2024.",
      "According to the animal welfare group Four Paws, since the start of the war, thousands of pet dogs and cats have been lost or abandoned. In 2022, a German organization set up a shelter at the Ukraine-Poland border to help rescue stranded pets.",

    "summary": "Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu is now juggling his own trial on corruption charges along with the war in Gaza and a new security challenge in neighboring Syria.",
    "story": [
      "Tel Aviv, Israel\u00a0\u2014 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took the stand Tuesday in his long-running trial for alleged corruption, setting off what's expected to be a weekslong spectacle that will draw unwelcome attention to his legal woes as he faces an international arrest warrant for war crimes and the fighting in Gaza continues. It is the first time a sitting Israeli prime minister takes the stand as a criminal defendant, an embarrassing milestone for a leader who has tried to cultivate an image as a sophisticated and respected statesman.",
      "Upon starting his testimony, Netanyahu said \"hello\" to the judges. One judge told him he had the same privileges as other witnesses and could sit or stand as he chose.",
      "\"I waited eight years for this moment, to say the truth,\" Netanyahu said, standing at a podium in a packed Tel Aviv courtroom. He called the charges against him \"an ocean of absurdness\" and promised his version would cut through the prosecution's case.",
      "Netanyahu appeared at ease as he began telling his version of events and shared personal details about his life that he might hope would shape the judges' perception of him. He said he used to lose sleep over media coverage but learned it had no meaningful bearing \u2014 in contrast to the prosecution's attempts to paint him as image-obsessed.",
      "He said he smoked cigars but could hardly finish them because of his workload, but hated champagne. One case revolves around him receiving a \"supply line\" of cigars and champagne from billionaire associates.",
      "His lawyer asked that he be allowed to receive notes while testifying to help ensure he can continue running the country.",
      "Netanyahu will answer during his court appearances to charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases.",
      "He is accused of accepting tens of thousands of dollars' worth of cigars and champagne from a billionaire Hollywood producer in exchange for assisting him with personal and business interests. He is also accused of promoting advantageous regulation for media moguls in exchange for favorable coverage of himself and his family.",
      "Netanyahu, 75, denies wrongdoing, saying the charges are a witch hunt orchestrated by a hostile media and a biased legal system out to topple his lengthy rule. His testimony caps years of scandals that have swirled around him and his family.",
      "The testimony, set to take place six hours a day, three days a week for several weeks, will take up a significant chunk of Netanyahu's working hours, prompting critics to ask if he can capably manage a country embroiled in a war on one front, containing the fallout from a second, and keeping tabs on other potential regional threats, including from Iran or the recent fall of longtime dictator Bashar al-Assad in neighboring Syria.",
      "Netanyahu, in his testimony, said he could \"find a balance\" between both commitments.",
      "Dozens of people gathered outside of the court in Tel Aviv, some protesting against Netanyahu, including family members of hostages held in Gaza, and also a group of his supporters. A banner draped in front of the court read: \"Crime Minister.\"",
      "Under Israeli law, indicted prime ministers are not required to step down. But the charges against Netanyahu cleaved deep divisions in Israel, with protesters demanding he resign and former political allies refusing to serve in government with the Israeli leader, triggering a political crisis that led to five elections in less than four years beginning in 2019. He overcame the political tumult only two years ago by striking an agreement with smaller right-wing parties that had long languished on the edges of Israeli politics, to form the country's most far-right government ever.",
      "Netanyahu's supporters view the charges as the result of the justice system's bias and overreach, while his opponents have accused him of prolonging the raging war in Gaza in a bid to distract from, if not delay his own court proceedings. Netanyahu launched the war on Gaza's Hamas rulers immediately after they carried out their brutal Oct. 7, 2023 terror attack on Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 others hostage.",
      "Despite the pressure, the polarizing Netanyahu has rejected calls to step down and has used his position as prime minister to lash out at law enforcement, media and courts.",
      "An Israeli court rejected a request by Netanyahu's lawyers to reduce the expected testimony hours, as well as several other requests to delay its start, which they said were necessary because of the prime minister's busy schedule and the country's significant challenges. A verdict isn't expected until 2026 at the earliest and Netanyahu will have the option to appeal at the Supreme Court.",
      "The court has spent months hearing prosecution witnesses in the three cases, including some of Netanyahu's once closest aides who turned state witnesses. The prosecution has tried to portray the prime minister as an image-obsessed leader who broke the law to improve his public perception.",
      "The most damaging case against Netanyahu involves an influence-peddling scandal in which two of his formerly closest aides have testified against him on suspicions of promoting regulation worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Israel's Bezeq telecom company. In return, Bezeq's popular news site, Walla, allegedly provided favorable coverage of Netanyahu and his family.",
      "Netanyahu is also alleged to have offered a newspaper publisher legislation that would weaken his paper's main rival in return for more favorable coverage.",
      "Moreover, the prime minister is accused of accepting nearly $200,000 in champagne and cigars from Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan and in exchange, he allegedly operated on Milchan's behalf on U.S. visa matters, tried to legislate a generous tax break for him and sought to promote his interests in the Israeli media market.",
      "Netanyahu's testimony could further tarnish his image at a complicated time for Israel's longest-serving leader. His popular support dropped after the Hamas attack in October 2023, with the public blaming his leadership for failing to prevent the assault, and if elections were held today polls suggest he would struggle to form another new government.",
      "Israel is still fighting Hamas in Gaza with no end in sight, despite heavy international pressure to wind down the war, as well as pressure from the families of hostages still held in Gaza and their supporters to bring their loved ones home.",
      "The Israeli leader, along with his former defense minister, also faces an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court for war crimes charges related to the war in Gaza, which his office has dismissed as \"absurd and false actions and charges.\"",

      "How does laughter positively impact the body?",
      "The body is receptive to laughter \u2014 here\u2019s how it works.",
      "There are two parts of the nervous system \u2014 the sympathetic and the parasympathetic, said Beth Oller, M.D., a family physician with Rooks County Health Center in Stockton, Kansas.",
      "The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for fight-or-flight responses, \"which are activated all too often in many of us, with all the things to worry about in our world today.\"",
      "Over-activation of the sympathetic nervous system can increase the risk of heart disease, cancer, obesity and other illnesses, an expert said. (iStock)",
      "Over-activation of the sympathetic nervous system can increase the risk of heart disease, cancer, obesity and other illnesses, Oller said.",
      "\"On the other hand, our parasympathetic nervous system is the one that calms our body down \u2014 and exercise, meditation, deep breathing and laughing can activate this system,\" the doctor continued.",
      "\"Laughing decreases the stress hormone cortisol, which helps reverse the stress response.\"",
      "\"Laughter is free, lacks side effects, and has psychological and physical benefits.\"",
      "Some early research has found that laughter decreases stress hormones, reduces artery inflammation and increases HDL, which is the \"good cholesterol,\" said Oller.",
      "\"Laughter has been associated with a lower prevalence of cardiovascular disease by increasing blood flow and oxygen intake,\" the doctor added. \"Laughter promotes vasodilation, which leads to improved blood flow and enhances circulation.\"",
      "FATHER OF THE BRIDE FORGETS HIS OWN DAUGHTER IN WEDDING-DAY \u2018FUMBLE\u2019",

      "The role of laughter in mental health",
      "The psychological benefits of laughter have been researched for some time, according to Sara Brides, a licensed clinical social worker who treats patients at Novant Health Cancer Institute in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.",
      "\"Laughter can reduce stress,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"Our brains can cope with stress; however, remaining in a stress response for prolonged periods of time is not healthy.\"",
      "\"One way to increase spontaneous laughter is to intentionally spend time with those you enjoy and who naturally make you laugh.\"",
      "When someone laughs \u2014 particularly when it\u2019s spontaneous or genuine laughter \u2014 endorphins are released, cortisol (the stress hormone) decreases, and dopamine and serotonin (the happy hormones) increase.",
      "\"Dopamine is associated with a sense of reward, pleasant sensations and motivation, and serotonin is associated with happiness, decreased depression and anxiety, and learning and motivation,\" Brides added.",

      "\"The American people, they delivered a mandate to the next president of the United States, and to President Trump the mandate is that this illegal immigration problem is something that needs to be fixed, that it needs to be fixed now,\" Sonza, an attorney and former Republican candidate in Ohio's 1st Congressional District, said.",
      "He explained that one of the \"biggest challenges\" Trump will face in order to deliver that immigration mandate is public officials \"continuing to defy the law\" in liberal jurisdictions.",
      "\"What we've seen is clear leadership in President Trump that he's not going to go for it,\" Sonza said. \"The sanctuary cities and sanctuary jurisdictions that are trying to now protect illegal immigrants, many of them criminals that have broken our laws, not just on the southern border, but here within our border as well, tried to harbor them within their jurisdiction. No \u2014 that is what undermines our national security and our safety in our community. And in President Trump, holding those cities and jurisdictions accountable is exactly, again, what we need in order to go back to a land of laws, and so this comes down to leadership.\"",

Sonza told Fox News Digital that deportation is not only a useful tool, but a necessary one as well.",
      "\"At the end of the day, it comes back to righting a wrong that we've seen in the last four years, going back to the way immigration should be, and that is the legal way when it comes to deportation,\" Sonza said. \"President Trump has been very clear on his strategy. There are priorities in terms of the prosecution and the deportation of dangerous individuals, including human traffickers, drug cartels, violent gangs like MS 13. They don't belong in our country, and they certainly have tried to exploit the immigration loopholes that they\u2019ve found on the southern border, smuggling people, drugs, weapons, inflicting devastating harm on our communities.

Look at visa overstays accounting for nearly 40% of illegal immigration. That is the very thing that President Trump in his plan is targeting by addressing violent criminals, addressing criminals that have broken laws within our community and then addressing overstays and fraudulent documentation.

These scams can take various forms, often disguised as legitimate offers or services that promise easy returns on investments. Let's look at the common signs of these scams, why they are so prevalent and what steps you can take to protect yourself from becoming a victim.",
      "GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS - SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S NEWSLETTER - THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE",
      "What is a blockchain scam?",
      "A blockchain scam refers to a deceptive scheme aimed at tricking you into losing your money or digital assets within the cryptocurrency space. As the popularity of cryptocurrencies continues to rise, so does the prevalence of these scams, which exploit the lack of regulation and the anonymity often associated with blockchain technology. In essence, blockchain scams come in various forms, each designed to mislead and defraud unsuspecting victims.",
      "One of the most common types is the \"Pump and Dump\" scheme. In this scenario, scammers artificially inflate the price of a low-value cryptocurrency by spreading false information or hype. Once the price reaches a certain level, they sell off their holdings, causing the price to plummet and leaving other investors with significant losses.",
      "Another notorious scam is the Initial Coin Offering scam. Here, fraudsters promote a new cryptocurrency project with promises of high returns and innovative technology. However, once they collect funds from investors, they often vanish without delivering any product or service, leaving investors with worthless tokens.",
      "Phishing scams are also rampant in the blockchain world. Scammers impersonate legitimate cryptocurrency platforms or services to trick you into providing sensitive information such as private keys or login credentials. Once they gain access to a victim's wallet, they can easily transfer funds to their own accounts.",
      "Additionally, there are fraudulent giveaway schemes where scammers promise to double or triple an individual's cryptocurrency holdings if they send a specific amount to a designated wallet. After sending their funds, victims find that the promised rewards never materialize.",

      "Unsolicited contact: Legitimate crypto services don\u2019t randomly reach out offering free money. If you receive an unexpected email claiming you\u2019ve won cryptocurrency or are entitled to a payment, it\u2019s a strong indicator that something is off.",
      "Pressure to act: Scammers often create a sense of urgency to push you into making hasty decisions. Phrases like \"Act now!\" or \"Limited time offer!\" are red flags that should make you pause and think twice before responding.",
      "Requests for payment: Any service asking for upfront fees to receive crypto is likely a scam. Genuine platforms will never require you to pay before delivering funds or services. So, be wary of any requests for payment in advance.",
      "Suspicious links: Scammers often embed links in emails or messages that lead to phishing sites designed to steal your credentials. Always hover over links to see where they lead before clicking, and if anything looks suspicious, don\u2019t engage. If you have any doubts about a link's legitimacy, it\u2019s best to avoid clicking on it altogether.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "Data breaches: Companies get hacked, and your info gets leaked faster than gossip at a high school reunion. Always monitor your accounts for unusual activity.",

      "Protecting yourself from blockchain scams",
      "Given the decentralized and often anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies, scams pose significant challenges in terms of tracing and recovering lost funds. Therefore, it\u2019s essential for anyone participating in the crypto space to stay informed about these scams, exercise caution when engaging in transactions and follow the steps below.",
      "1. Verify independently: Always log in to your accounts directly, not through email links. Scammers often create fake websites that look almost identical to legitimate ones, so it's crucial to enter URLs manually or use bookmarks for trusted sites. This simple practice can prevent you from falling victim to phishing attempts.",
      "2. Use strong authentication: Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication on all your crypto accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring not just your password but also a second form of verification, such as a text message code or an authentication app. Even if someone manages to steal your password, they won\u2019t be able to access your account without this additional verification.",
      "3. Be skeptical: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Scammers often lure victims with promises of guaranteed returns or exclusive investment opportunities. Always approach such offers with skepticism and conduct thorough research before making any commitments.",
      "4. Check email addresses: Scammers frequently use domains that look similar to legitimate ones, so always double-check the email address from which a message originates. A small typo or a different domain can indicate a scam. If you're unsure, reach out directly to the company using contact information from their official website.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "5. Keep software updated: Ensure your devices and antivirus software are up to date.\u00a0Regular updates often include security patches that protect against vulnerabilities that scammers might exploit. Keeping your software current is a critical step in safeguarding your digital assets.",
      "6. Consider using a data removal service: Personal data removal services can help scrub your personal information from the web, making it harder for scammers to target you with personalized phishing attempts. By reducing your digital footprint, you can significantly decrease the chances of being targeted by malicious actors.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your personal data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Remember, in the world of crypto, vigilance is your best friend. If you're ever unsure about an email or offer, it's always better to err on the side of caution. Don't hesitate to reach out to official support channels. Stay safe out there, and may your crypto wallets always be full (and scam-free).",

    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 10:00:21 -0500",
    "summary": "Tech expert Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson discusses how Chinese cyber espionage targets U.S. telecoms to steal Americans&apos; information.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News correspondent David Spunt has more on the \"sophisticated penetration\" of several carriers on \"Special Report.\"",
      "U.S. telecom giants are under constant attack from Chinese hackers. A federal investigation has uncovered a massive cyber espionage campaign by the Chinese government, targeting U.S. telecommunications networks to steal Americans' information. A top White House official confirmed that at least eight U.S. telecom companies have been affected by this hacking spree.",
      "To combat this, the FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) have released advice for telecom companies to help them detect and block the hackers while preventing future attacks. I break down the details of this Chinese hacking campaign and share tips on how to keep your data safe.",
      "GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS \u2013 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S NEWSLETTER \u2013 THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know about the China hacking campaign",
      "According to the FBI, hackers linked to Beijing have infiltrated the networks of \"multiple\" telecom companies, gaining access to customer call records and private communications of \"a limited number of individuals.\" Since this is an espionage campaign, they\u2019re not interested in the average Joe\u2019s texts or call history. Instead, their targets are Americans involved in government and politics.",
      "The hackers also tried to copy \"certain information that was subject to U.S. law enforcement requests pursuant to court orders,\" according to the FBI. This suggests they might have been attempting to breach programs like those under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows U.S. spy agencies to monitor the communications of individuals suspected of working for foreign powers.",
      "Earlier this month, Deputy National Security Advisor Anne Neuberger shared new details about the scale of the Chinese hacking campaign. According to Neuberger, the U.S. believes the hackers managed to access communications from senior government officials and prominent political figures.",
      "She explained that while the hackers were focused on a relatively small group of individuals, a limited number of Americans\u2019 phone calls and texts were compromised. Neuberger also mentioned that the affected telecom companies are working to address the breaches, but none have been able to completely remove the Chinese hackers from their networks yet.",
      "This campaign is believed to have started a year or two ago, according to the\u00a0Associated Press. Authorities suspect a Chinese hacking group known as Salt Typhoon to be behind the operation.",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HERE\u2019S WHAT RUTHLESS HACKERS STOLE FROM 110 MILLION AT&T CUSTOMERS",
      "How are hackers able to access sensitive information?",
      "Salt Typhoon managed to access call records and private communications by exploiting decades-old back doors in major telecom providers, including AT&T and Verizon, experts believe.",
      "\"The irony here is that the back doors exploited by the Chinese are, in fact, the same back doors that are utilized by federal law enforcement for purposes of conducting legal surveillance,\" John Ackerly, CEO and co-founder of Virtru, a data-centric security company, told CyberGuy.",
      "The vulnerabilities are a result of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), a federal law that mandates back doors in critical telecommunications infrastructure. CALEA enables law enforcement agencies to access phone records and metadata, including facilitating wiretaps, as part of authorized investigations.",
      "\"The problem with back doors is simple. They're not selective. A back door created for law enforcement is, by its very nature, a vulnerability in the system. And vulnerabilities, once they exist, can be exploited by anyone who discovers them. Both good guys and bad guys can enter back doors,\" said Ackerly, who previously served as a White House technology adviser.",

      "BEWARE OF ENCRYPTED PDFs AS LATEST TRICK TO DELIVER MALWARE TO YOU",
      "The solution is end-to-end encryption",
      "To protect private conversations and phone calls, cybersecurity experts recommend using end-to-end encrypted platforms. Jeff Greene, executive assistant director of cybersecurity at CISA, urged Americans to prioritize encrypted communication tools.",
      "\"Use your encrypted communications where you have it,\" Greene advised, emphasizing the importance of secure platforms. He added, \"We definitely need to do that, kind of look at what it means long term, how we secure our networks.\"",
      "An FBI official warned that citizens should be \"using a cellphone that automatically receives timely operating system updates, responsibly managed encryption and phishing resistant MFA for email, social media and collaboration tool accounts.\"",
      "However, cybersecurity experts warn that these measures are not foolproof. The term \"responsibly managed encryption\" is problematic, as it intentionally leaves room for \"lawful access,\" such as the back doors required by CALEA.",
      "\"It\u2019s clear that encryption with back doors is not actually responsible at all,\" Ackerly said. \"It\u2019s time for the U.S. government to acknowledge and support end-to-end encryption as a stronger protection against foreign adversaries.\"",

      "10 ways to protect your personal information against cybersecurity threats",
      "Now that we've discussed the threat, let\u2019s take a look at the solutions. Here are 10 ways you can keep your personal information safe.",
      "1) Use end-to-end encrypted platforms:\u00a0For private communications, prioritize platforms that offer end-to-end encryption. This ensures that only you and the intended recipient can access your messages or calls, preventing unauthorized access by hackers or other third parties.",
      "\"Anyone can take control of their own data and protect themselves from security threats by using applications that provide end-to-end encryption. Whether you\u2019re emailing, sending messages and files or video chatting, the only way to truly ensure your data is safe from bad actors is to encrypt it as it travels,\" Ackerly said. \"Choose an app or tool that is easy to use, so that you will actually use it.\"",
      "For texting, consider apps like\u00a0Signal or WhatsApp. For email services, look for ones that offer easy-to-use end-to-end encryption. These platforms ensure that your private communications remain secure from unauthorized access.\u00a0See my review of the best secure and private email services here.",
      "2) Keep your device's operating system updated:\u00a0Make sure your cellphone and other devices automatically receive timely operating system updates. These updates often include important security patches that protect against new vulnerabilities exploited by hackers. For reference, see my guide on\u00a0how to keep all your devices updated.",
      "3) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Set up phishing-resistant\u00a02FA on your email, social media and collaboration tool accounts. This adds an extra layer of protection, requiring more than just a password to access your accounts, making it harder for cybercriminals to steal your information.",
      "4) Use strong antivirus software: Be aware of phishing techniques and remain skeptical of suspicious links, emails or phone calls asking for personal information. Cybercriminals often use these methods to gain access to your sensitive data.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5) Encrypt sensitive data:\u00a0Encrypt data on USB drives, SIM cards and laptops to protect information if devices are lost or stolen. Also, be sure to password-protect your sensitive files or folders by following\u00a0these steps.",
      "6) Implement strong password practices: Use unique, complex passwords for each account and consider using a\u00a0password manager.",
      "7) Regularly backup your data: Backing up your data helps protect against data loss from ransomware or device failure. You'll want to back up your\u00a0mobile device,\u00a0Mac and\u00a0Windows computers.",
      "8) Be cautious with public Wi-Fi: Use a\u00a0VPN (virtual private network) when connecting to\u00a0public Wi-Fi networks to encrypt your internet traffic. This makes it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "9) Invest in personal data removal services: Consider services that scrub your personal information from public databases. This reduces the chances of your data being exploited in phishing or other cyberattacks after a breach.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "10) Use identity theft protection: Identity theft protection services monitor your accounts for unusual activity, alert you to potential threats and can even assist in resolving issues if your data is compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "There\u2019s no denying that the U.S. is facing a serious cyberattack that puts millions at risk. What\u2019s even more concerning is that hackers continue to exploit telecom providers even after the issue has been made public. The government and the affected companies must prioritize addressing this threat and patching the back doors these cybercriminals are using. We\u2019re witnessing one of the largest intelligence compromises in U.S. history.",

      "2) Disconnect from the internet: This can prevent potential remote access by scammers.",
      "3) Do not provide remote access: Never give control of your device to unsolicited callers.",
      "4) Run a security scan using strong antivirus software: Use reputable, up-to-date, strong antivirus software to check your system. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "8) Invest in personal data removal services: Using a data removal service can be an effective additional step to protect your personal information after a potential tech support scam.

By eliminating unnecessary or outdated information, data removal services minimize your online presence, making it harder for scammers to find and exploit your data.",

    "story": [
      "A VPN could be your secret weapon to protect your identity and finances.",
      "VPNs (virtual private networks) are a powerful tool for securing your internet connection. They protect your data by encrypting it, making it harder for hackers or even your internet service provider (ISP) to see what you're doing online. But how should you set up a VPN? Should you install it on each device or run it on your home network through a router? We will break down the pros and cons of both methods to help you make the right decision.",

      "Woman using a VPN on her cellphone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How VPNs work",
      "VPNs operate through two primary mechanisms: IP address masking and data encryption. When you connect to a VPN, it hides your real IP address by assigning you a new one from their server network, effectively preventing websites and cyber criminals from tracking your location or identifying you based on your IP address.",
      "Simultaneously, VPNs encrypt all data transmitted between your device and the internet, rendering it unreadable to anyone who might attempt to intercept it. This encryption process ensures that sensitive information, such as credit card details, remains confidential throughout your online activities. By combining these two powerful features, VPNs create a secure tunnel for your internet traffic, significantly enhancing your online privacy and security.",
      "VPN on devices vs. router: What's the difference?",
      "Understanding the difference between using a VPN on individual devices vs. setting it up on your router is crucial for maximizing your online security and privacy.",
      "Most people are familiar with using a VPN app on their phone, laptop or tablet. In this setup, the device connects directly to the internet through the VPN, keeping that device's internet activity secure.",
      "With a VPN router, instead of installing a VPN on each device, the router connects to the VPN. This means every device connected to your Wi-Fi \u2013 whether a smartphone, laptop, gaming console or even a smart TV \u2013 automatically uses the VPN, even if that device doesn\u2019t support VPN apps.",
      "A home router (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "TOP ROUTERS FOR BEST SECURITY 2024",
      "Why use a VPN router?",
      "There are several advantages to running a VPN directly on your router.",
      "A VPN router ensures that every device on your network is protected, even those that don\u2019t support VPNs, like smart home devices or certain game consoles. Once the router is set up with a VPN, it encrypts the internet traffic of all connected devices.",
      "Installing or managing VPN software on every device is unnecessary with a VPN router. Once the router is configured, you can sit back and enjoy a protected internet connection across your entire home network. However, it\u2019s a good idea to occasionally check that the connection is working properly using tools like DNS leak tests.",
      "Using a VPN prevents your ISP from seeing which websites or services you\u2019re using. This is particularly useful if you\u2019re concerned about privacy or want to access geo-restricted content, such as streaming services like Netflix or gaming platforms.",
      "A home router (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Are there any downsides to VPN routers?",
      "While VPN routers are convenient, they do come with a few potential drawbacks.",
      "Most basic routers provided by your ISP don\u2019t support VPN connections. You\u2019ll likely need to purchase a more advanced, VPN-compatible router, which can be pricier, starting at around $50 and going much higher for premium models.",
      "Encrypting all the traffic in your home network requires processing power. If you have a lot of devices connected at once, a primary router might struggle to keep up. In this case, a higher-end router with more processing power is recommended.",
      "When you use a VPN app on a device, switching server locations, adjusting security settings or choosing different VPN protocols is easy. Making these changes on a VPN router requires logging into the router\u2019s settings, which can be more time-consuming and complicated.",
      "DON'T TOSS YOUR OLD INTERNET ROUTER UNTIL YOU DO THIS",
      "How to set up a VPN on a router",
      "Setting up a VPN on your\u00a0router may seem complex, but it significantly enhances your digital security, especially when paired with a robust router. Here\u2019s how to approach this process.",
      "Choose a compatible VPN service: Select a VPN provider that supports\u00a0router installations. Look for services that offer comprehensive guides and customer support to assist you through the setup.",
      "Select the right router: Ensure your router is VPN compatible and has strong security features. Opt for\u00a0routers that support the latest Wi-Fi encryption standards, such as WPA3, and have built-in firewalls to protect against external threats. This will provide a solid foundation for your VPN connection.",
      "Install the VPN: Follow your VPN provider's step-by-step instructions to configure the service on your\u00a0router. This typically involves entering your login credentials, installing necessary certificates and selecting a server location.",
      "Test your connection: Once configured, verify that your VPN is functioning correctly by testing the connection. Ensure that all devices connected to the router are protected by the VPN.",
      "Leverage additional security features: Take advantage of your router\u2019s features such as guest networks and parental controls to enhance security further. A separate guest network prevents unauthorized access to your main network, while regular firmware updates from the manufacturer help mitigate vulnerabilities.",
      "By integrating these steps, you not only set up a VPN but also fortify your home network against potential cyber threats.",

      "WHY YOU SHOULD BE USING A VPN TO SAFEGUARD YOUR STOCK TRADING ACTIVITIES",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Both VPN routers and VPN apps have their own strengths, and the right choice depends on your specific needs. A VPN router might be the way to go if you\u2019re looking for convenience and whole-home protection. But if you prefer flexibility and more control over individual devices, sticking with a VPN app might suit you better.

      "1. Check all of your cable connections",
      "While it might sound obvious, the first step to troubleshooting a computer that constantly crashes is ensuring everything is firmly plugged in. It's often the most overlooked step, so if you're using a desktop, you'll want to look behind your PC and ensure everything is plugged in. It would be best to try using a different electrical outlet to first rule out any electrical issues in your home.",
      "If you feel comfortable opening up your desktop PC, you can also go inside the case and ensure all your PCI connections are firmly plugged in. You'll want to ensure all your cables going to the power supply are firmly connected, and the same is true with the PCI power cables that supply electricity to the GPU and CPU.",

      "Computer overheating is a common cause of intermittent shutdowns and crashes. If your CPU (central processing unit), essentially the brain of your computer, or graphics card gets too hot, your computer might shut down to ensure the components aren't damaged. If you notice that your laptop or desktop is giving off a lot of heat, or in the case of a laptop, it is hot to the touch, or if you notice your fans running louder than usual, these are all signs of overheating.",
      "If your computer is overheating, the first step is to clean it thoroughly. I recommend blowing dust out of the interior fans with compressed air and keeping your PC in an area where it can receive proper airflow. If you have a desktop PC, try not to keep it under your desk. Keeping a PC under a desk can cause issues with dust build-up and lack of airflow. It's best to keep your desktop in a part of your home or office where it can receive a decent amount of airflow.",

      "Have you ever found yourself needing to constantly turn the volume up on your TV because it sounds like the actors onscreen are speaking in whispers, but then whenever action is onscreen, your TV feels deafening? It's not just you.",
      "This is one of the most common issues people have with their TV audio, but, fortunately, you can change a few settings on your TV to make the dialogue sound clearer.",

      "A viewer adjusting TV audio settings with a remote control. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Most modern TVs feature preset audio settings that you can adjust on the fly to make things sound better, depending on whether you're gaming, watching a live concert or watching a slow-burn drama. Too much bass will often obscure spoken dialogue in TV shows and movies, and I suggest going through your TV's preset audio settings to see if you can make the audio clearer. Most TVs feature a movie, music and standard mode for TV audio. You can find your TV's audio presets by navigating to the settings from your remote and selecting \"sound.\"",
      "Some TVs will also feature audio presets explicitly designed for dialogue. Check to see if you have a setting for \"Dialogue,\" \"News,\" \"Speech\" or even \"Speech Boost\" in your TV audio settings. Any three of these should help your TV dialogue come through more clearly. You might also want to consider disabling settings for surround sound or bass boost, as these can cover up the sound of dialogue by increasing the bass too much.",
      "Increasing the treble might be worth it if you have access to EQ settings on your TV and are struggling to hear TV dialogue. It's an easy fix that can improve audio quality without taking too much away from non-dialogue sound in a movie or TV show.",

      "2. Adjust dynamic range compression",
      "A floor-standing speaker. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Dynamic range compression, or \"volume leveling,\" is useful for tailoring audio sound to personal needs. Volume leveling reduces the gulf between the loudest and quietest sounds onscreen, making it easier to hear and understand onscreen dialogue, especially in action movies, where the dialogue is often much quieter than the preceding action sequence. You'll find the settings for volume leveling or dynamic range compression in your TV audio settings, which, on most TVs, you can access directly from the remote.",
      "My TV features volume leveling, and I love to use it when I watch TV late at night at a low volume. It helps me to understand everything easily without having the speakers loud enough to wake anyone else up. It's also a great way to keep the audio level when commercials come on if you watch cable.",

While a few high-level TVs come with a built-in soundbar, you'll still have the best experience with your own independent speakers or a soundbar. If you followed the two tips above but are still having trouble hearing movie or TV dialogue, it might be time to look into and invest in a set of speakers or, if you want a single unit,\u00a0a soundbar.",
      "I prefer using a soundbar with a TV over speakers for a cleaner setup because they often come with built-in subwoofers that enhance the bass, making action scenes and music sound more immersive. Additionally, modern soundbars are sleek and can easily blend with your home decor. Many of them also support advanced audio technologies like Dolby Atmos, which provides a surround sound experience without the need for multiple speakers scattered around the room.",

      "What is scambaiting?",
      "Scambaiting is when someone interacts with a scammer to waste their time and resources. Some of these online experiences are entertaining and even hilarious to watch. Instead of falling for their sneaky tricks, scambaiters play along, knowing it's a scam, and take on the role of a potential victim to keep the scammers busy. But get this \u2014 there's now some new technology to do the scambaiting for you.",

      "TOP 10 ROBOCALL HOTSPOTS IN AMERICA",
      "Why scambaiting matters",
      "So, why should we care about scambaiting? This creative strategy offers several compelling benefits. First and foremost, it effectively wastes scammers' time. Every minute they spend on the phone with Daisy is a minute they can't use to target real victims. By keeping them occupied, we can potentially prevent them from scamming someone else.",
      "In addition to wasting time, scambaiting raises awareness about common scams. It serves as an educational tool, helping others recognize and avoid falling prey to similar tactics. The more people understand how these scams operate, the less likely they are to become victims. Moreover, watching scammers get flustered sheds light on the lengths these criminals will go to and highlights the importance of staying vigilant against their schemes.",

      "That's Daisy, an artificial intelligence-powered grandma developed by Virgin Media O2 to interact with scammers. When a scam call comes in, Daisy automatically answers and engages the caller in conversation, wasting their time. With her friendly personality and quick thinking, she keeps them on the line while gathering useful information about their tactics.\u00a0Daisy combines various AI models that work together to listen and respond to fraudulent calls instantaneously. She's so lifelike that she has successfully kept numerous fraudsters on calls for 40 minutes at a time. By tricking the criminals into thinking they were defrauding a real person and playing on scammers' biases about older people, Daisy has prevented them from targeting real victims.",
      "Now, before you get too excited, Daisy is currently only available for customers of Virgin Media O2 in the U.K., but other companies in the U.S. are beginning to offer similar AI-driven solutions. For instance,\u00a0Apate.ai has developed AI.Callee, which engages scammers in real-time conversations across various channels. Another U.S. company,\u00a0Scamnetic, has launched an AI-based scam-detection solution that can be integrated into enterprise platforms to protect consumers from various types of scams.",

      "Protecting yourself from robocall scams",
      "While scambaiting can be a fun way to fight back against scams, the best defense is simply not picking up and answering scam calls in the first place. One effective strategy is to consider investing in personal data removal services that wipe your information from public databases on the internet. By reducing your digital footprint, you can make it more difficult for scammers to contact you in the first place. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

      "The introduction of AI-powered scambaiters like Daisy marks a new era in the fight against fraud. While it's entertaining to imagine scammers being outwitted by a chatty AI grandma, it's important to remember that the ultimate goal is to protect vulnerable individuals from falling victim to these schemes. As technology evolves, so do the tactics of scammers, making it crucial for everyone to stay informed and vigilant.

      "Preston noted that the proposed state would border Mexico in an effort to combat illegal immigration. Among his many grievances are California's crime woes, which prompted voters to recall San Francisco's district attorney in 2022 and Alameda County DA Pamela Price in November. In Los Angeles County, voters ousted DA George Gascon on Nov. 5 after only one term as critics blamed him for being too lenient on criminals.",

    "summary": "Analysts and commentators say the collapse of Syria&apos;s Bashar al-Assad&apos;s regime is likely to reshape the power dynamics in the Middle East while signaling a critical shift in influence among world powers.",
    "story": [
      "Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., joined 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the latest on the overthrow of Assad's regime in Syria, President-elect Donald Trump's demand for NATO members and the status of Pete Hegseth's confirmation process.",
      "The stunning collapse of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime in Syria has sent shock waves throughout the region and beyond, marking a dramatic turning point after nearly 14 years of civil war. Assad\u2019s rule, long sustained by Russia and Iran, has come to an end, leaving his former patrons scrambling to manage the fallout. The implications for these two powers, as well as for the broader regional and global landscape, are profound.",
      "Russia\u2019s involvement in Syria was never just about Assad, experts say. Securing a foothold in the Middle East was a cornerstone of Moscow\u2019s strategy, with the Khmeimim Air Base and Tartus naval facility serving as vital assets for projecting power. However, with Assad now gone, Russia\u2019s assets in Syria are at risk.",
      "Rebekah Koffler, strategic military intelligence analyst and author of \"Putin\u2019s Playbook,\" emphasized the significance. \"Syria has been a key theater in the broader proxy conflict between Russia and the U.S. losing Assad represents a strategic defeat for Russia, costing them critical bases in the Middle East and further stretching their military resources as they continue fighting in Ukraine.\"",

      "Ksenia Svetlova, a senior non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council, described the fallout as, \"Russia has been exposed for what it really is- a power that overpromises but underdelivers. They came to Syria with grand ambitions, but apart from helping Assad survive through joint efforts with Iran and Hezbollah, they achieved little. The post-war reconstruction never began, and with Russia now focused on Ukraine, Syria became a secondary priority. Now, Russia has abandoned Assad, revealing itself as an unreliable partner.\"",
      "She said this failure sends a message to Moscow\u2019s allies. \"In the Middle East, Russia now looks weak compared to the United States. Syrians are stunned that Moscow left 'Baby Assad,' as the regime opponents call him, to collapse, while the U.S. has demonstrated strength by standing firmly with Israel in its time of need.\"",

      "The fall of Assad highlights Syria\u2019s role as a battleground in the U.S.- Russia proxy war, as Koffler explained. \"Before Assad\u2019s fall, President Trump reportedly called Putin to de-escalate tensions, but instead, Putin doubled down by escalating his nuclear doctrine, signaling a refusal to back down. Now that Assad, one of Putin\u2019s key allies, has lost Syria, the balance of power shifts dramatically. With this loss, Trump may have newfound leverage over Putin, as losing Syria undermines Russia\u2019s influence in the region and strains its already overstretched resources. This could open a path for Trump to negotiate the end of the war in Ukraine from a stronger position, leveraging Putin\u2019s setbacks in Syria.\"",

Syria was a crucial link in Tehran\u2019s \"Axis of Resistance,\" connecting Iran to Hezbollah in Lebanon and enabling the smuggling of weapons across the region via a corridor stretching from Iran through Iraq and Syria into Lebanon.",
      "\"This is an unprecedented, historic moment,\" Svetlova said. \"The Iranian \u2018Ring of Fire,\u2019 meticulously built by Qassem Soleimani, has been shattered. If Soleimani was still alive, he would be horrified to see the collapse of his life\u2019s work.\"",
      "The weakening of Hezbollah during its war with Israel further exacerbated Assad\u2019s vulnerability, leaving the regime without critical support on the ground. Hezbollah had been a key force assisting Assad\u2019s army during the civil war, but after sustaining heavy losses to Israeli forces, it could no longer provide sufficient support. Meanwhile, Iran refrained from sending additional troops to bolster Assad.",

For years, Khamenei and the Revolutionary Guard funneled resources into preserving the Axis of Resistance, draining the Iranian people\u2019s wealth. Now, with Assad gone, there is hope that Iran\u2019s oppressive influence in the region will weaken. This is a moment of joy for those who have long opposed the regime\u2019s policies.\"",
      "\"The Iranian people and the regime are worlds apart in their perspectives,\" said another Iranian dissident who spoke anonymously to Fox News Digital from the country. \"While the regime has largely watched Assad's downfall from the sidelines, likely due to its own internal weaknesses or strategic agreements, the Iranian people are celebrating. There\u2019s a wave of hope and joy spreading across social media, fueled by the idea that revolutions in countries aligned with the Islamic Republic - past or present - could spark a domino effect. For many, Assad's collapse represents the weakening of the resistance axis and a glimmer of possibility for change within Iran itself.\"",

      "Before presenting his documentation to the world, Neuer attempted to address it directly with UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini. In a letter to Lazzarini, Neuer explained that Lazzarini\u2019s staff have previously complained that U.N. Watch did not submit its reports to UNRWA for comment prior to publishing. Neuer then recounted several attempts to meet personally with Lazzarini to discuss U.N.

      "The Summary",
      "A report on proposed changes to U.S. dietary guidelines suggests encouraging people to eat more beans and lentils for protein and less red meat.Updated guidelines are expected to go into effect later next year. Future guidelines should also spur people to eat more whole grains and consume less sugary drinks, sodium and processed food, the report says.",

      "Updated guidelines are expected to go into effect later next year.",
      "Future guidelines should also spur people to eat more whole grains and consume less sugary drinks, sodium and processed food, the report says.",
      "Eat more beans, peas and lentils as protein sources and decrease consumption of processed and red meat \u2014 those changes are among the recommendations detailed in a new report suggesting potential updates to U.S. dietary guidelines.",
      "The guidelines are changed on a five-year schedule, and the new set is expected to go into effect next year. The report, released Tuesday, comes from an advisory committee to the Agriculture Department, made up of 20 professors in the public health and medical sectors.",
      "The committee proposed that the updated guidelines, which would remain in effect into 2030, should emphasize plant-based proteins and encourage people to eat more whole grains and decrease their intake of sugary drinks, sodium and processed foods.",
      "\"There\u2019s strong evidence to suggest that a dietary pattern that is high in beans, peas and lentils is associated with lower chronic disease risk,\u201d said the advisory committee\u2019s vice chair, Angela Odoms-Young, a professor of maternal and child nutrition at Cornell University.",
      "Under the current dietary guidelines, beans, peas and lentils are categorized as both vegetables and protein foods. But the new report proposes removing them from the vegetable group and putting them at the top of the list of protein foods to encourage people to eat more plant-based protein.",
      "The suggestions are based on a review of published studies on long-term links between diet and the risk of chronic conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease.",
      "Past research has established a link between diets high in processed red meat (products like bacon and hot dogs) and a greater risk of negative health outcomes, including cancer and dementia. Although questions linger about the health effects of unprocessed red meat, like home-cooked steaks or lamb chops, years of research and diet rankings consistently find a regimen commonly known as the Mediterranean diet to be the healthiest.",
      "That eating pattern is primarily plant-based, with multiple servings of fruits and vegetables daily, alongside whole grains, legumes, nuts, olive oil and seafood. Red meats are eaten only occasionally. The diet has been linked to\u00a0a lower risk of cardiovascular disease\u00a0and\u00a0related conditions\u00a0like obesity, high cholesterol and hypertension.",
      "Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S. Replacing some red and processed meats with plant-based protein sources could help address that, Odoms-Young said.",
      "She suggested that people try \u201cmeatless Mondays,\u201d reducing the portion sizes of meat in meals or incorporating more beans, peas or lentils into meals they are already planning.",
      "\"That's not saying that you can't eat animal protein, but how do you have a diet where you can increase the amount of plant-based protein in the diet,\" she said.",
      "The report also recommends that people cut down on sugary drinks and sodium and increase their whole grain intake to make up 50% of all grains eaten. Consuming high amounts of sugar and salt, coupled with low amounts of whole grains, negatively affects health outcomes, the report said.",
      "\"When we look at the evidence around how those things impact people's health, we see that the major diseases, chronic diseases, that are responsible for preventable deaths are linked to those excess consumptions,\" said another member of the advisory committee, Cheryl Anderson, the dean of the University of California, San Diego\u2019s Herbert Wertman School of Public Health and Human Longevity Science.",
      "A 2019 study linked high consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages to a greater risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, while other research published the same year found that consuming excess salt increased the likelihood of hypertension. Whole grains, meanwhile, are known to help lower the risk of diabetes, heart disease and other conditions, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "Odoms-Young and Anderson said that in crafting the proposed changes, committee members considered how to make them equitable, practical and accessible across various groups, factoring in differences in socioeconomic status and access to grocery stores, for example.",
      "\"We are making these recommendations with the hope that no matter where people live, learn, work, play or pray, they would be able to follow the guidance,\" Anderson said.",
      "Odoms-Young said the proposal is just a preliminary step, since \"most of the guidelines people don't meet right now.\"",
      "More broadly than the report, she said, U.S. leaders should consider how to implement policies and programs that help people meet the country's dietary guidelines.",
      "The report has been submitted to the Agriculture Department and the Department of Health and Human Services for review, and a 60-day public comment period is underway. In the end, the government can decide whether or not to adopt some or all of the recommendations."

      "Gukesh, who became at the age of 12 then the second-youngest grandmaster in history represents a new wave of Indian talent after Anand broke Russia\u2019s grip on the game with his title win in 2007. Gukesh has called Anand his \u201cinspiration and a role model.\u201d",

    "summary": "Luigi Mangione, who is charged with killing the UnitedHealthcare CEO, appears to have posted online about struggling with chronic back pain and undergoing spinal surgery.",
    "story": [
      "The man charged with killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson posted online in recent years about undergoing spinal surgery and struggling with chronic back pain, numbness and restless sleep, according to what appears to be an archived version of his deleted Reddit account.",
      "Luigi Mangione, 26, was charged Monday in New York with one count of murder, three counts of criminal possession of a weapon and one count of possession of a forged instrument. Thompson\u2019s murder, which occurred last week outside a hotel in New York City, has captured national attention, spurring conversations about gun violence, corporate America and the health care industry.",
      "Mangione\u2019s attorney has said that he intends to plead not guilty to all charges.",
      "The archived Reddit posts may shed light on Mangione\u2019s interests and mental state over the last eight years. He appears to have been active on the platform since 2016 under the username \u201cMister_Cactus,\u201d posting most frequently about spine health, travel and gaming.",
      "Although the account has been suspended, NBC News reviewed an archive of its deleted posts and comments spanning several years. The activity appears to match up with known events in Mangione\u2019s life. NBC News also spoke to several of his friends who said that although they weren\u2019t able to confirm that the Reddit account was Mangione\u2019s, some of the posts aligned with Mangione and his life events.",
      "A Reddit spokesperson said the platform\u2019s policy is to suspend accounts that may be related to suspects in high-profile criminal investigations, a common practice among tech companies to avoid impersonation or interference in such cases.",
      "The activity on the \u201cMister_Cactus\u201d account included posts on a subreddit focused on spondylolisthesis, a condition in which a bone in the spine slips out of alignment and puts pressure on the lower vertebrae and the nerves around the spine.",
      "In comments exchanged with another user on the subreddit in April, \u201cMister_Cactus\u201d wrote that his condition \u201cwent bad to the point where I felt it every day.\u201d",
      "A post sharing advice with other spondylolisthesis patients in October 2023 reads: \u201cConstant pain means something is wrong.\u201d",
      "Yoni Ashar, an expert in pain science and an assistant professor at the University of Colorado\u2019s Anschutz Medical Campus, said back pain can lock patients in a \u201cvicious cycle\u201d that affects sleep, mental health and other aspects of their well-being.",
      "\u201cIt could be the endless agony from the moment you wake up to the moment you manage to fall asleep, if you\u2019re able to sleep,\u201d Ashar said. \u201cIt\u2019s just nonstop, always there, always hurting.\u201d",
      "On a separate subreddit, the \u201cMister_Cactus\u201d account solicited guidance in 2018 about \u201crestless sleep,\u201d describing waking up frequently throughout the night and feeling \u201cunrefreshed no matter how much sleep I get.\u201d",
      "Reddit posts from last year suggest that the back problems flared up after the user went surfing. The movement aggravated back pain that he said he had dealt with since childhood, according to a post in July 2023. After the surfing incident, the post continued, \u201cI slipped on a piece of paper and my right glute locked and right leg shut down for a week.\u201d",
      "\u201cMister_Cactus\u201d wrote at the time that he had been experiencing issues with his right hip for the past year and a half. He felt pain while sitting, he said, and he had twitching in his leg muscles and sometimes numbness and tingling in his groin",
      "The Reddit posts suggest that the account holder underwent spinal fusion surgery in 2023 and that he grappled with the decision beforehand.",
      "Spinal fusion surgery involves inserting bone or a bonelike material into the space between two spinal bones, then connecting the grafts and the bones with metal plates, screws or rods. The goal is to fuse the bones to relieve pressure on the vertebrae and reinforce the spine\u2019s shape and stability.",
      "That type of back surgery can reduce pain significantly, though recovery can take up to a year as bone grafts fuse with the vertebrae. A 2022 study found that out of around 100 patients who underwent the surgery, around 85% to 90% reported satisfaction.",
      "In the post from July 2023, \u201cMister_Cactus\u201d told another Reddit user that his operation was scheduled for two weeks later, \u201cand I keep wondering why I was so afraid of it.\u201d",
      "In the same exchange about the surgery, he said that \u201cit\u2019s not worth being so afraid of more pain/fusions down the line that you don\u2019t live your life now.\u201d",
      "The posts the next month suggest he saw positive results after the operation \u2014 he wrote that after a week, he \u201cwas on literally zero pain meds\u201d and was able to sit, walk and stand.",
      "\u201cWhen my spondy went bad on me last year (23M) it was completely devastating as a young athletic person,\u201d \u201cMister_Cactus\u201d wrote in a separate post in August 2023, referring to spondylolisthesis. He included a list of athletes with \u201csuccess stories\u201d following spinal fusion surgery.",
      "\u201cThis is not to encourage surgery per se, but just to provide reassurance that athletic life is totally normal after fusion if/when the surgery is necessary,\u201d he wrote.",
      "The Reddit posts correspond with the activity of accounts that seem to be linked to Mangione on other social media platforms. An account that appears to be Mangione\u2019s on the book review site Goodreads has on its \u201cread\u201d list books about chronic back pain and dieting, as well as \u201cIndustrial Society and Its Future,\u201d the so-called Unabomber Manifesto written by domestic terrorist Ted Kaczynski. The account gave it four out of five stars. The profile, which went private Wednesday, uses a photo of Mangione that matches others available of him, and it has activity dating to at least 2017.",
      "On X, meanwhile, header photos on an account under Mangione\u2019s name show an X-ray image of a spine with what appear to be four rods or screws inserted. (Posts on the X account date to 2016 and appear to align with Mangione\u2019s life events, such as a reference to a speech he gave as a high school senior.)",
      "Two people who were in touch with Mangione in recent years told NBC News that he talked to them about either his back pain or his concerns about the U.S. health care system.",
      "Gurwinder Bhogal, a British freelance writer who publishes a Substack newsletter called \u201cThe Prism,\u201d said he corresponded with Mangione from April to June.",
      "\u201cWe briefly touched on the differences between the U.K. and U.S. health care systems,\u201d Bhogal said. \u201cLuigi complained about how expensive health care in the U.S. was and expressed envy at the U.K.\u2019s nationalized health system.\u201d",
      "R.J. Martin, the founder of a co-living space in Hawaii called Surfbreak, where Mangione lived for six months in 2022, said Tuesday on \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d that the two had talked at the time about Mangione\u2019s spinal condition.",
      "\u201cI knew it was something that constantly weighed on him,\u201d Martin said. \u201cIt was something that impeded him from doing many things.\u201d",
      "Martin described Mangione\u2019s time at Surfbreak as \u201ca bit of a roller coaster,\u201d adding that Mangione had stayed in Hawaii to \u201ctake care of himself\u201d but \u201chad his ups and downs.\u201d"

      "The lawsuits, filed anonymously in New York state Supreme Court by lawyer Thomas Giuffra, involve incidents that happened from  2019 to 2022. All allege that Combs raped and sexually assaulted them.",
      "One man alleged Combs\u2019 associates threatened him into keeping quiet. Another alleged his assault was filmed and he was given cash after the attack. The third man alleged Combs and \u201chis associates from Bad Boy Records\u201d took turns sexually assaulting him.",
      "The way Combs went after these men was \u201cvery consistent, frighteningly consistent, exactly consistent,\u201d Giuffra told NBC News. \u201cHe would hit them with the drinks, knock them out.\u201d",
      "And when they woke up, \u201che\u2019d be raping them,\u201d the lawyer said.",
      "The new complaints are the latest in a wave of lawsuits filed against Combs in recent months \u2014 all with the complainants withholding their names \u2014 accusing him of assault and rape under similar circumstances going back to the 1990s. Combs has been behind bars since September when he was arrested by federal agents and accused of engaging in a yearslong scheme to sexually abuse and exploit women.",
      "Prosecutors said Combs, among other things, used his business empire to coerce victims into elaborate, drug-fueled \u201cfreak offs\u201d with male sex workers that he arranged, directed and recorded.",
      "Combs, 55, who is being detained at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, has pleaded not guilty to charges of racketeering, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution.",
      "His lawyers have said he is innocent of all charges. He has been denied bail three times ahead of his criminal trial, which is scheduled to start in May.",
      "The three men represented by Giuffra are all seeking unspecified damages from Combs and his companies along with a jury trial. They\u2019re also not divulging their real names.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re afraid that one night, somebody affiliated with him, hired by him, could end their life,\u201d Giuffra said.",
      "In addition to Combs, the three lawsuits list as defendants Bad Boy Entertainment Holdings Inc., Bad Boy Entertainment LLC., Bad Boy Productions Holdings, Inc., Daddy\u2019s House Recordings, Inc., and Sony Music Holdings Inc.",
      "\u201cThese complaints are full of lies. We will prove them false and seek sanctions against every unethical lawyer who filed fictional claims against him,\u201d Combs\u2019 legal team said in a statement Thursday.",
      "All complainants are identified in the new lawsuits as John Doe, and they all allege that the abuse happened under similar circumstances with Combs preying on the men by luring them, with the help of his associates, to hotel rooms or his private home, plying them with drugged drinks and then sexually assaulting and raping them.",
      "One John Doe was a longtime employee of Combs. He said in his lawsuit that he was hired in 2006 by Combs in his capacity as CEO of Bad Boy Records to run errands for him. He said that in February 2020, one of Combs\u2019 assistants arranged a private meeting with Combs at a Manhattan hotel to \u201cdiscuss missing job payments\u201d and when he arrived Combs served him an \u201calcoholic\u201d drink that made him \u201cexcessively tired.\u201d",
      "Combs suggested he \u201clay down on the couch and take a nap,\u201d the man said, according to the lawsuit. The man awoke to find Combs raping him on the couch, the court papers state.",
      "Afterward, the man said in the lawsuit that Combs and his associates threatened him to keep quiet.",
      "Another complainant said he met Combs at a Manhattan nightclub in 2019 and was \u201crecruited\u201d by Combs\u2019 security guards to join him \u201cand the rest of his entourage at the Park Hyatt hotel for an exclusive afterparty.\u201d",
      "There, he said in the lawsuit, Combs offered him a \u201ccocktail\u201d that he had personally made and then invited him and the other guests into a bedroom.",
      "\u201cOnce Plaintiff entered the bedroom, the room \u2018started spinning\u2019 and his mouth became very dry,\u201d the man said according to the court papers.",
      "Combs eventually led him to a sofa where he lost consciousness and later awoke to Combs raping him, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The man said in the lawsuit that he tried to resist and, before he blacked out again, remembered seeing\u00a0 \u201ca man and a woman sitting on the bed recording the rape on a camera.\u201d",
      "The next morning he was given $2,500 by the man who filmed the alleged rape and said it was from Combs, according to the lawsuit.",

    "summary": "The vast majority of people whose call records have been stolen by Chinese hackers have not been notified, according to industry sources.",
    "story": [
      "The vast majority of people whose call records have been stolen by Chinese hackers have not been notified, according to industry sources, and there is no indication that most affected people will be notified in the near future.",
      "The FBI, AT&T and Verizon \u2014 the two telecommunications companies the hacking campaign appears to have affected most severely \u2014 have for months alerted some victims whose phone calls were listened to or texts were read. Many of those people were high-value intelligence targets related to U.S. politics and government, an FBI official said in a media call last week. The presidential campaigns of Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, as well as the office of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told NBC News in October that the FBI had informed them that they had been targeted.",
      "The hackers accessed a different but still sensitive type of information for far more people, mostly in the Washington, D.C., area: more generalized information about phone calls and texts, called metadata. Phone companies maintain records like which phone numbers participated in calls and when those calls happened and potentially the locations of the cell towers their phones connected to.",
      "Even if the records do not pair phone numbers with customers, intelligence services may already know targets\u2019 numbers and use phone metadata to map out their travels and contacts.",
      "Alan Butler, the executive director and president of the nonprofit Electronic Privacy Information Center, said having one\u2019s phone metadata exposed is a clear violation of privacy.",
      "\u201cYou should be upset, because carriers\u2019 deficient practices resulting in the exposure of whether you called an oncologist or your church is enough of a violation, regardless of whether the actual content of those calls was also disclosed,\u201d Butler told NBC News.",
      "The hacking campaign accessed the metadata of more than a million people, an industry source briefed on the matter said. The FBI has no plans to alert those victims, an agency official said last week, and two industry sources, one familiar with AT&T\u2019s plans and one with Verizon\u2019s, said those companies have not contacted most of them.",
      "In an emailed statement, an AT&T spokesperson said the company \u201cwill continue to comply with our obligations to notify affected parties.\u201d A person familiar with the company\u2019s plans said that meant AT&T was notifying only a very small number of victims who had been affected. A person familiar with Verizon\u2019s plans said it had made similar outreach to a small number of customers whose communications were affected.",
      "Both companies declined to clarify plans for alerting people whose metadata was accessed. The Federal Communications Commission, which oversees telecommunications companies\u2019 obligations to customers whose information is breached, declined to comment.",
      "The hacking campaign, nicknamed Salt Typhoon, is one of the largest intelligence compromises in U.S. history. It has breached eight domestic telecom and internet service providers and dozens of others around the world, and it is still ongoing, a White House official said last week. The U.S., Australia, Canada and New Zealand claim it is part of an intelligence operation conducted by China.",
      "A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington has denied responsibility.",
      "While some consider phone metadata to be\u00a0 less sensitive than the contents of communications, it can still provide enormous value to intelligence services. In a 2014 forum, Gen. Michael Hayden, who previously directed both the CIA and the National Security Agency, said, \u201cWe kill people based on metadata.\u201d",
      "Dakota Cary, a China adviser at the cybersecurity company Sentinel One, said Chinese intelligence would most likely find call records, times and phone locations for the Washington area valuable.",
      "\u201cIf they pulled the call data for the National Capital Region, that would be useful for intel,\u201d Cary said. \u201cMapping the social relationships between groups of politicos would be pretty useful.\u201d",
      "The U.S. and Western cybersecurity companies have for years accused China\u2019s cyberspies of systematically stealing Americans\u2019 personal information. China has generally denied the\u00a0 accusations, often referring to the U.S.\u2019 own spying efforts.",
      "In a media call last week, the senior White House official, who asked not to be named, said that the government does not believe every American\u2019s phone records had been exposed but that Chinese intelligence had accessed the metadata of a large number of people it would be interested in.",
      "In the FBI media call, the official said that while it had conducted a major outreach campaign to people whose communications were accessed, it would not do so for people who only had their metadata stolen.",
      "\u201cThe providers and/or the carriers, whatever term we want to use, would really have the responsibility to notify their customers of the stolen records. That would not typically fall to CISA or the FBI,\u201d the FBI official said. CISA is the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.",
      "\u201cWhere we\u2019ve actually been able to prove content intercept, whether text or audio, the FBI has made individual victim notifications to all of those individuals or to their counsel,\u201d he said.",
      "Beyond AT&T and Verizon, other companies the Salt Typhoon campaign targeted have either said little about what the hackers accessed or said the hackers were not able to get much. Lumen, a midsize Louisiana-based internet service provider, was identified this year as a victim of Salt Typhoon, though it is unclear what the hackers sought to gain from it. A Lumen spokesperson said that the company had no evidence Chinese hackers were still in its networks and that \u201cour federal partners have not shared any evidence that would suggest otherwise.\u201d",
      "Another midsize internet service provider, Charter Communications, was targeted in the Salt Typhoon campaign, a person familiar with the matter said.",
      "Unlike other companies, T-Mobile has been relatively open with the public about having initially been infiltrated by hackers who appeared affiliated with Salt Typhoon, though it says that the hackers\u2019 access appears to have been cut off and that no customer data was accessed.",
      "Jeff Simon, the company\u2019s chief security officer, said the hackers appeared to have tried to gain access through another telecommunications company.",
      "\u201cWe were able to detect that activity rather quickly and essentially disconnect or stop it by disconnecting the connectivity to the other telecommunications provider,\u201d he said.",
      "Simon reiterated that the campaign was ongoing, however.",
      "\u201cThey did not give up,\u201d he said. \u201cOur assumption is that this actor is not going to give up after this one round. I mean, they\u2019re going to keep trying to get back in.\u201d"

    "published": "Thu, 12 Dec 2024 15:49:26 GMT",
    "summary": "The Montana Supreme Court affirmed a lower court ruling that temporarily blocked a state law prohibiting transition-related health care for transgender minors.",
    "story": [
      "The Montana Supreme Court on Wednesday affirmed a lower court ruling that temporarily blocked a state law prohibiting transition-related health care for minors.",
      "The suit, which was filed by two transgender teens and their families, as well as two providers of transition-related care, will now go to trial before Missoula County District Court Judge Jason Marks, who initially blocked the law in September 2023.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union and Lambda Legal, an LGBTQ legal advocacy group, which are representing the teens and providers, said the decision was a victory for the state\u2019s trans youths.",
      "\u201cFortunately, the Montana Supreme Court understands the danger of the state interfering with critical healthcare,\u201d Kell Olson, an attorney for Lambda Legal, said in a statement. \u201cBecause Montana\u2019s constitutional protections are even stronger than their federal counterparts, transgender youth in Montana can sleep easier tonight knowing that they can continue to thrive for now, without this looming threat hanging over their heads.\u201d",
      "Chase Scheuer, press secretary for Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen, said the office looks forward to \u201cdefending the case on its merits, which will include recent scientific developments ignored by this court.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Supreme Court has abandoned Montanans once again to rule in favor of their out-of-state political allies,\u201d Scheuer said in an emailed statement. \u201cIn upholding the district court\u2019s flawed decision to temporarily block a duly enacted law, the Supreme Court put the wellbeing of children -- who have yet to reach puberty -- at risk by allowing experimental treatments that could leave them to deal with serious and irreversible consequences for the rest of their lives to continue.\u201d",
      "Doctors treat gender dysphoria \u2014 the distress that results when a person\u2019s gender identity is in conflict with their gender assigned at birth \u2014 on a case-by-case basis, but minors who do pursue medical transition begin puberty blockers, which temporarily stop puberty, at its onset.",
      "Montana\u2019s Republican-controlled Legislature passed a law in April 2023 prohibiting health care providers from using puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgery to treat minors with dysphoria. The law also prohibits Medicaid from covering such treatments for trans minors.",
      "When Marks issued a preliminary injunction against the law last year, he wrote that it was likely unconstitutional and that \u201cbarring access to gender-affirming care would negatively impact gender dysphoric minors\u2019 mental and physical health.\u201d",
      "He also noted that the same Legislature, which described puberty blockers and hormone therapy as \u201cexperimental,\u201d had passed a law giving patients, including minors, the right to receive treatment with experimental drugs if they consent and the treatment is recommended by a health care provider, The Associated Press reported.",
      "In upholding the injunction, Montana Supreme Court Justice Beth Baker wrote in the majority opinion that the Legislature \u201cdid not make gender-affirming care unlawful,\u201d nor \u201cdid it make the treatments unlawful for all minors,\u201d as minors can still receive the treatments for other reasons.",
      "\u201cInstead, it restricted a broad swath of medical treatments only when sought for a particular purpose,\u201d Baker wrote, adding that the law \u201cputs governmental regulation in the mix of an individual\u2019s fundamental right \u2018to make medical judgments affecting her or his bodily integrity and health in partnership with a chosen health care provider.\u2019\u201d",
      "All seven state Supreme Court justices agreed with the decision to uphold the injunction. Two issued a separate concurring opinion, arguing that the court should have made clear that discrimination based on transgender status is a type of sex discrimination prohibited by the equal protection clause of Montana\u2019s Constitution. One issued a partial dissent, arguing that the court should\u2019ve allowed the portion of the law prohibiting Medicaid coverage of trans care for minors to take effect, because \u201cthere is no current federal mandate for Medicaid funding of gender-affirming care.\u201d",
      "Montana is one of 26 states that has passed a law restricting transition-related care for minors, according to the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ think tank. Montana garnered international headlines last year when state lawmakers were debating the law. State Rep. Zooey Zephyr, the first trans woman elected to Montana\u2019s Legislature, was censured in a party-line vote after telling her colleagues that they would have blood on their hands if they supported the restriction on trans care.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court took up such restrictions for the first time last week, when it heard arguments over a similar law in Tennessee. It is expected to issue a decision this summer."

      "How Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign burned through more than $1.4 billion in 15 weeks dominated the storyline of the vice president\u2019s devastating loss to Donald Trump on Nov. 5.",
      "While there are questions that only the campaign itself can answer, the four people running to be the next Democratic National Committee chair say they want to find out as much as they are able about an election in which Democrats had more money and manpower but lost the White House anyway.",
      "In interviews, the candidates for DNC chair said that as the party moves into 2025, it should be armed with a postmortem to learn lessons from an election in which the Democratic presidential candidate lost every battleground state and the popular vote.",
      "The DNC would not have the power to conduct a forensic examination into the Harris campaign\u2019s spending, as the campaign is a separate entity, but the candidates each said they supported a broad review of what happened leading up to the White House loss, including looking at messaging, voter outreach and how resources were dispensed.",
      "Ken Martin, the Minnesota Party chair and a DNC vice chair, said the party needs a sweeping review of how it is approaching the electorate. He called for a third-party audit of the entire party infrastructure, including the DNC and its sister committees that fight for Democratic gains in Congress.",
      "\u201cI think you\u2019re looking at everything. It\u2019s not just contracts and consultants, it\u2019s not just ad spends and media buys, it\u2019s A through Z,\u201d Martin said.",
      "While Martin took particular aim at consultants, saying they \u201cneed to go,\u201d he said he was not referring to the Harris campaign.",
      "\u201cThis is not a commentary on any one specific campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a commentary on the culture of Washington, D.C.\u201d",
      "Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler said the party would be best armed to win future elections by diving into 2024 data.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important for us to learn every lesson we can about what just took place, and that\u2019s ecosystem-wide,\u201d Wikler said. \u201cIt\u2019s about reckoning with what works, what didn\u2019t, what we can learn, how we can win as many elections as we can \u2014 and stretch every resource as far as we can \u2014 in the years to come. Learning from what just took place is a good way to do that.\u201d",
      "Wikler is also urging the party to look at alternative ways of communicating to voters, including appearing on shows that traditionally cater to conservative audiences, as well as building out progressive news spaces \u201cfree of right-wing propaganda.\u201d",
      "Wikler, Martin, former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley and New York state Sen. James Skoufis have announced they are running for DNC chair in an election that will take place Feb. 1.",
      "It's unclear what kind of impact any kind of postmortem would have. After Mitt Romney lost the presidential contest in 2012, Reince Priebus famously led a Republican \"autopsy\" to better understand what went wrong. Among the conclusions was that the party was too old and that it needed better messaging on immigrants. Then, Trump won in 2016, blowing up many of the report's assertions.",
      "On Thursday, the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee will meet to hash out some of the details of the election. Democrats will hold four public forums for the candidates throughout January.",
      "President Joe Biden\u2019s handpicked DNC chair, Jaime Harrison, has announced he is stepping down. When Republicans control the White House, the DNC chair role becomes an open contest, and that person wields far more power than when a Democrat is president.",
      "Biden granted his campaign chair, Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, vast political control, leading to plenty of consternation within the DNC and in some corners of the campaign over what critics described as a top-down approach in decision-making. Harrison wielded little power at that time \u2014 which some DNC officials said should change moving forward.",
      "\u201cRegardless of whether you have the White House or not, you can\u2019t shelve the chair or the chair\u2019s voice in this process,\u201d a DNC official complained in an interview about the 2024 campaign. \u201cThis should be the last cycle that this happens.\u201d",
      "How Democrats used their vast resources has come under particular scrutiny after Harris\u2019 presidential campaign raised \u2014\u00a0and spent \u2014 a stunning $1.4 billion in 107 days. The pace rattled supporters, donors and even some on the campaign, who complained of lavish spending on celebrities and ongoing appeals for money even after Harris lost the election.",
      "\u201cThere needs to be a full review, a full and formal evaluation of this last cycle \u2014 the good, the bad and the ugly,\u201d Skoufis said. \u201cCertainly, as part of that broader review, I very strongly believe we should be looking at that partnership ... between the DNC and the Harris campaign. Was it effective? And yes, was the money spent appropriately, not just on the DNC side, but also within the presidential campaign?\u201d",
      "O\u2019Malley called for an \u201cafter-action report\u201d about what worked and what did not for the party\u2019s strategy this year but stopped short of calling for a forensic audit of the\u00a0DNC or the Harris campaign, noting they are separate entities.",
      "\u201cWe need a dispassionate after-action to learn what worked and what didn\u2019t,\u201d he Malley said. \u201cI refuse to call it an autopsy.\"",
      "\u201cOpenness and transparency is the opening ante in building trust ... in order to rebuild trust with people who gave generously, time and again.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Even though a record number of kids died from the flu last year, the percentage of children getting flu shots continues to plummet.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Wednesday that as of Nov. 30, just over a third of U.S. kids \u2014 37% \u2014 had gotten flu shots, down from 43% at the same time last year.",
      "The downward trend worries pediatricians who are starting to see an uptick in flu cases.",
      "\u201cI always have a little bit of dread when flu season is around the corner,\u201d said Dr. Kristina Bryant, a pediatric infectious disease doctor at Norton Children\u2019s in Louisville, Kentucky, \u201cbecause children experience illness and suffering during flu season, and much of that can be prevented through vaccination.\u201d",
      "Just over half of kids, 55%, got the flu shot during the 2023-24 season, the lowest rate in 12 years, said Alicia Budd, head of the CDC\u2019s domestic influenza surveillance team.",
      "\u201cFlu coverage had been slowly increasing\u201d before Covid hit, Budd said. \u201cFlu vaccination levels have not rebounded to pre-pandemic levels.\u201d",
      "This year\u2019s flu shot covers the two main strains of the virus circulating so far, H1N1 and H3N2.",
      "Budd said any strain of the flu can be dangerous for kids. \u201cWe are not seeing anything yet that would indicate that this season would be any different,\u201d she said.",
      "A preliminary report released in October suggested the flu shots\u2019 effectiveness at keeping kids ages 5 and younger out of the hospital may be on the lower end, at just 39%. Last year\u2019s shot was estimated to be up to 61% effective at preventing hospitalization in kids.",
      "Dr. Michelle Taylor, a pediatrician who is the health officer of the Shelby County Health Department in Memphis, Tennessee, said the flu vaccine is safe and worthwhile, even if it\u2019s not perfect.",
      "\u201cEven if you\u2019re exposed and you are positive for flu, that shot gives the best chance of having a much easier course of illness than if you had not been vaccinated at all,\u201d Taylor said.",

      "Flu season was particularly deadly for kids last year, when 205 children died \u2014 a record number since before the pandemic.",

      "\u201cSome seasons, we see a really sharp peak and then it goes away quickly. Other seasons are more long and drawn-out,\u201d Budd said. \u201cLast year was more drawn-out, so unfortunately, there was more opportunity for children to get infected.\u201d",
      "Who needs the flu shot this year?",
      "The CDC recommends an annual flu shot for everyone 6 months and older.",
      "For most, that\u2019s a single shot. Kids who\u2019ve had only one shot may need two, four weeks apart, to be considered fully vaccinated.",

    "story": [
      "Biden administration officials said Wednesday they have no current plans to authorize a stockpiled bird flu vaccine, despite an escalating outbreak among livestock in the U.S. and at least 58 human infections across seven states.",
      "The move means any decisions about a bird flu vaccine will likely be left to health officials in the incoming Trump administration, who may be led by anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whom Trump has picked to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "The virus has been spreading in dairy cows since the spring and had infected at least 774 herds in 16 states as of Wednesday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Last Friday, the Agriculture Department stepped up its response to the outbreak, issuing a federal order mandating testing of the national milk supply.",
      "The USDA said the testing, set to begin next week in six states, will give farmworkers better confidence in the safety of their animals and their ability to protect themselves from infection, as well as give officials a better sense of where herds are infected.",
      "The virus\u2019s spread in mammals that have close contact with humans is concerning for public health experts, because it gives the bird flu many opportunities to jump to people and potentially mutate to spread effectively from person to person.",
      "Almost all bird flu cases in the U.S. have been in farmworkers who have had contact with infected animals \u2014 either dairy cows or poultry \u2014 aside from a patient in Missouri and a child in California. A teen in Canada who got very sick and was hospitalized also had no clear contact with infected animals.",
      "The federal government has two bird flu vaccine candidates available in limited quantities in the nation\u2019s stockpile, though they need to be authorized by the Food and Drug Administration before they can be used.",
      "In May, health officials said the government would begin looking at vaccination if the virus mutated in ways that would make existing antivirals like Tamiflu less effective, or if it appeared it was causing serious illness in people.",
      "Dr. Nirav Shah, the CDC\u2019s principal deputy director, said Wednesday that the criteria for deploying a vaccine remains the same.",
      "\u201cWhen we think about respiratory vaccines, their sweet spot is really in preventing severe disease and death,\u201d Shah said. \u201cWhen we look at what is currently unfolding with H5, even in the human cases, thankfully what we\u2019ve seen thus far is mild disease,\u201d he said, using a shorthand for the strain of the influenza virus causing the bird flu outbreak.",
      "\u201cThat is not a guarantee, and that could change, but that is one of the things that we are on the lookout for because the vaccine would be maximally effective against reducing severity of disease,\u201d Shah said. While the administration isn\u2019t considering a vaccine today, that could change if the outbreak changes, he said.",
      "Still, some public health experts believe the time for vaccination is now, particularly for farmworkers.",
      "\u201cI do not think we should gamble with farmworkers\u2019 lives by waiting for them to be hospitalized or die before using the tools we have to protect them,\u201d said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health.",
      "A balancing act",
      "Whether to authorize or deploy a vaccine is a constant balancing act for public health agencies, Shah said, noting that even the safest vaccine can come with side effects.",
      "In 1976, at the first signs of an H1N1 swine flu outbreak in the U.S., public health officials quickly initiated a nationwide vaccine campaign. The shot, however, caused a small increased risk of Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare condition that causes the immune system to attack healthy nerve cells.",
      "The outbreak never spread widely, but it set public trust in the flu shot back decades.",
      "\u201cIt led to an analysis and introspection about whether the response to those 13 cases of swine flu had been an overreaction,\u201d Shah said. \u201cAnd, indeed, there was a high degree of vaccine skepticism that emerged.\u201d",
      "Still, the public health agencies are prepared to authorize a vaccine for bird flu if needed, Shah said, adding officials are consistently testing strains against the vaccine candidates.",
      "A spokesperson at the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, an agency within HHS that manages the nation's stockpile, said the agency has worked to \u201cfill and finish\u201d vaccine doses of a candidate vaccine that\u2019s well-matched to the virus circulating in dairy cows.",
      "There will be up to 10 million doses available by the end of the first quarter of next year, enough to vaccinate 5 million people, the spokesperson said.",
      "A spokesperson for the FDA said the agency is \u201cactively engaged with federal partners in the U.S., as well as industry,\u201d including evaluating potential vaccine candidates, should the need arise for use in people.",
      "When is the right time?",
      "Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said there isn\u2019t a need to authorize a vaccine at this time, given the lack of evidence of human-to-human spread nor signs that the virus is causing severe disease in people. Existing tools, such as antivirals and personal protective equipment, are sufficient enough right now, he said.",
      "There are a higher number of cases, but Schaffner attributed that to public health officials looking harder for the virus through testing and surveillance.",
      "Schaffner said the incoming Trump administration\u2019s anti-vaccine rhetoric doesn\u2019t change his stance.",
      "\u201cI think we should be very careful about anticipating what the new administration will do,\u201d he said. \u201cThe administration will be getting a lot of good, solid scientific evidence, not only from people at the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration, but they will hear from industry and lots of public health officials and experts across the country.\u201d",
      "The Trump transition team didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "Dr. Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, also said it\u2019s not necessary to authorize a vaccine at this time.",
      "\u201cWe need to keep advocating based on the science and data to make informed decisions, or do the best we can at the intersection of science, economics and political science,\u201d\u00a0Poulsen said.",
      "Nuzzo, of the Brown University School of Public Health, said that while antivirals are important for anyone exposed to or infected with the virus, their effectiveness is limited by a very small window of time in which they must be given. She also said the country\u2019s testing strategy is not timely enough to adequately protect farmworkers.",
      "A vaccine, she said, could protect farmworkers from the possibility of severe illness.",
      "Poulsen said one issue officials could run into, however, is finding farmworkers who are willing to get the vaccine, noting that some may be distrustful of the shot.",
      "\u201cI would start with seasonal flu and only go to the H5N1 strains if they find that people are propagating virus or getting severely sick,\u201d Poulsen said.\u00a0\u201cThat has not happened.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A federal judge in North Dakota blocked a Biden administration rule that allowed DACA recipients to sign up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act.",
      "In a ruling Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Dan Traynor sided with a group of 19 Republican state attorneys general who filed a lawsuit in August to prevent the rule from taking effect, saying it violates a law that prohibits giving public benefits to people without legal immigration status.\u00a0Traynor was appointed by Trump during his first term in office.",
      "People who received benefits from DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, began signing up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, at the start of open enrollment on Nov. 1. Coverage for those who signed up was expected to start as early as\u00a0 Jan. 1.",
      "They had been barred from getting government-funded health insurance, meaning their only option was to get coverage through their jobs or state programs that offer it. Others went uninsured or relied on low cost or free care through community health clinics.",
      "Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach, who led the legal effort against the Biden administration, called it a \u201cbig win for the rule of law.\u201d",
      "\u201cCongress never intended that illegal aliens should receive Obama care benefits,\u201d he wrote in a post on X.",
      "DACA was an executive action signed by then-President Barack Obama in June 2012 that protected undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children from deportation and gave them work authorization. DACA recipients are sometimes referred to as \"Dreamers.\"",
      "Drishti Pillai, director of immigrant health policy at KFF, a nonprofit group that researches health policy issues, said Monday\u2019s ruling applies only to the 19 states that filed the lawsuit, leaving the Biden administration rule in effect elsewhere.",
      "Those states are Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.\u00a0\u200b\u200b",
      "Still, the elimination of expanded coverage, Pillai said, could leave thousands of uninsured DACA recipients in those states without an affordable option. She added that it\u2019s unlikely that the ruling will be appealed.",
      "\u201cGiven that President-elect Trump tried to end DACA during his first term and his views on immigration more broadly, the Trump administration seems unlikely to appeal any ruling against DACA or the coverage expansion,\u201d Pillai said.",
      "In an interview with NBC News\u2019\u00a0Kristen Welker that aired Sunday, Trump said he would work with Democrats on a deal that allows DACA recipients to stay in the U.S.",
      "\u201cI want to be able to work something out, and it should\u2019ve been able to be worked out over the last three or four years and it never got worked out,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "Middletown Mayor Tony Perry needs answers.",
      "The constituents of his northern New Jersey township want to know what is going on with the strange lights that have been hovering in the night sky for weeks.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure how I can go back to my residents and say that I\u2019m satisfied from this meeting, when now I know that I have 180 drones that have been flying over the state of New Jersey,\u201d Perry said following a briefing Wednesday with a representative from the Department of Homeland Security. \u201cWe have no more information as to where these drones are coming from, where they\u2019re launching from, where they\u2019re landing.\u201d",
      "The briefing comes as New Jersey is experiencing one of the more bizarre, widespread and extended bouts ever recorded of what appear to be unknown autonomous vehicles.",
      "The drones \u2014 which are not \u201chobbyist,\u201d but commercial-grade devices, according to many officials \u2014 have sparked concerns over privacy, security and public safety since the first sightings in mid-November. Eyewitness reports, social media videos and officials confirm the drones are up to 6 feet in diameter, can quickly go from emitting eerie lights to no light at all and often avoid detection.",
      "Now, the unexplained drone sightings \u2014 and the lack of information about them \u2014 are prompting uncertainty and frustration from local officials and law enforcement who say agencies like the FBI and Homeland Security aren\u2019t doing enough to be transparent with residents.",
      "At Wednesday\u2019s briefing hosted by Gov. Phil Murphy\u2019s office, a representative from Homeland Security joined via Skype to speak alongside state officials, addressing local officials on the issue. Murphy did not attend, according to local officials who were at the meeting.",
      "The FBI, which announced earlier this week that it was opening an investigation into the drones, did not have a representative present, Perry told NBC News. Other than that, little information is available. Mayors in attendance at the briefing told NBC News that no one from state or federal agencies could directly confirm how many drones they believe could be flying over the state, with one saying they know of \u201cat least 400 sightings,\u201d while another said \u201cthere could be thousands.\u201d",
      "In a Wednesday segment of a program on WBGO, Murphy said that there could be \u201coverreporting\u201d of sightings, with many residents potentially seeing the same device or mistaking other flying objects for drones.",
      "Several officials present at the briefing stated that the drones are commercial-grade, but that they cannot confirm whether the drones belong to U.S. companies or foreign entities.",
      "Though Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J. said Wednesday that the drones were coming from an Iranian \u201cmothership\u201d off the East Coast, the Pentagon quickly denied the claims.",
      "\u201cThere is no Iranian ship off the coast of the United States, and there\u2019s no so-called mothership launching drones towards the United States,\u201d Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said the same day.",
      "Shortly after the meeting ended, New Jersey Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia posted online about her frustration, emphasizing her belief that \u201cmilitary intervention is the only path forward.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe know nothing. PERIOD,\u201d she wrote via X. \u201cTo state that there is no known or credible threat is incredibly misleading, and I informed all officials of that sentiment.\u201d",
      "Murphy later expressed plans to send letters to the congressional leadership and President Joe Biden urging answers for the community: \u201cOverwhelmingly, the feds have to take the lead here.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m relying overwhelmingly on the experts and the federal government who do this for a living,\u201d he responded to a question regarding claims that there are no viable dangers. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence that anything is armed. There\u2019s some theories out there \u2014 we take nothing off the table.\u201d",
      "Technological developments that have improved the capability and availability of drones have made the machines a growing nuisance around the world \u2014\u00a0as well as a national security issue. Drones have begun playing a larger role in military conflicts, while also pestering American bases in the United Kingdom and the U.S. Police now often take special precautions to counter drones at major events.",
      "The New Jersey drones were reportedly seen over the Naval Weapons Station Earle in Monmouth County and Picatinny Arsenal in Morris County, two military bases in the state, as well as over dozens of homes.",
      "Mine Hill Mayor Sam Morris, who attended Wednesday\u2019s briefing, told NBC News that while officials said that they are able to detect and confirm drone sightings in multiple counties in the state, many of the drones go dark and lack any kind of trackers, making it difficult to take them down, identify them or follow them.",
      "The FBI said at a Homeland Security hearing in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday that while it has started an investigation, it did not yet have answers.",
      "\u201cWe do not attribute that to an individual or a group, yet; we\u2019re investigating but I don\u2019t have an answer of who\u2019s responsible for that,\u201d Robert W. Wheeler Jr., assistant director of the Critical Incident Response Group for the FBI, said.",
      "When asked whether there is a risk to the public, Wheeler said, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that is known, that would lead me to say that, but we just don\u2019t know and that\u2019s the concerning part.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Northern Command, a military agency established after 9/11 to coordinate Department of Defense civilian disaster response efforts, confirmed Wednesday that though it is aware of the sightings and has conducted an analysis, it has \u201cnot been requested to assist with these events.\u201d",
      "State Sen. Jon Bramnick released a statement Tuesday urging the New Jersey leadership to announce a limited state of emergency in order to ban all drone flights until authorities can give more information on the sightings.",

      "Monmouth County Sheriff Shaun Golden joined in the calls for a state of emergency Wednesday, urging the governor in a statement to issue an executive order banning recreational drone use during nighttime hours.",
      "He said the drones have caused a growing sense of \u201cunease\u201d among residents. A map released by Monmouth County depicts several areas of reported sightings.",
      "As such sightings continue, New Jersey residents have taken to social media to share images and videos of the drones flying above them.",

      "On Monday, a group of 20 mayors from Morris County wrote a letter to Murphy expressing \u201cdeep concern\u201d and emphasizing the impact on 500,000 county residents and officials. The letter requested a formal investigation into the flights, clear communication to officials and an implementation of preventative measures to tackle unsafe drone operations.",
      "Murphy said during a press gaggle Monday that he doesn\u2019t \u201cblame people for being frustrated,\u201d adding \u201cthe most important point to say is we don\u2019t see any concern for public safety.\u201d",
      "Despite his emphasis that there is no cause for concern, more local officials are coming forward to say they are disappointed in the lack of transparency from both state and federal officials.",

      "One man alleged Combs\u2019 associates threatened him into keeping quiet. Another alleged his assault was filmed and he was given cash after the attack. The third man alleged Combs and \u201chis associates from Bad Boy Records\u201d took turns sexually assaulting him.",
      "The way Combs went after these men was \u201cvery consistent, frighteningly consistent, exactly consistent,\u201d Giuffra told NBC News. \u201cHe would hit them with the drinks, knock them out.\u201d",
      "And when they woke up, \u201che\u2019d be raping them,\u201d the lawyer said.",
      "The new complaints are the latest in a wave of lawsuits filed against Combs in recent months \u2014 all with the complainants withholding their names \u2014 accusing him of assault and rape under similar circumstances going back to the 1990s. Combs has been behind bars since September when he was arrested by federal agents and accused of engaging in a yearslong scheme to sexually abuse and exploit women.",

      "One John Doe was a longtime employee of Combs. He said in his lawsuit that he was hired in 2006 by Combs in his capacity as CEO of Bad Boy Records to run errands for him. He said that in February 2020, one of Combs\u2019 assistants arranged a private meeting with Combs at a Manhattan hotel to \u201cdiscuss missing job payments\u201d and when he arrived Combs served him an \u201calcoholic\u201d drink that made him \u201cexcessively tired.\u201d",
      "Combs suggested he \u201clay down on the couch and take a nap,\u201d the man said, according to the lawsuit. The man awoke to find Combs raping him on the couch, the court papers state.",
      "Afterward, the man said in the lawsuit that Combs and his associates threatened him to keep quiet.",
      "Another complainant said he met Combs at a Manhattan nightclub in 2019 and was \u201crecruited\u201d by Combs\u2019 security guards to join him \u201cand the rest of his entourage at the Park Hyatt hotel for an exclusive afterparty.\u201d",

    "summary": "The Montana Supreme Court affirmed a lower court ruling that temporarily blocked a state law prohibiting transition-related health care for transgender minors.",
    "story": [
      "The Montana Supreme Court on Wednesday affirmed a lower court ruling that temporarily blocked a state law prohibiting transition-related health care for minors.",
      "The suit, which was filed by two transgender teens and their families, as well as two providers of transition-related care, will now go to trial before Missoula County District Court Judge Jason Marks, who initially blocked the law in September 2023.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union and Lambda Legal, an LGBTQ legal advocacy group, which are representing the teens and providers, said the decision was a victory for the state\u2019s trans youths.",
      "\u201cFortunately, the Montana Supreme Court understands the danger of the state interfering with critical healthcare,\u201d Kell Olson, an attorney for Lambda Legal, said in a statement. \u201cBecause Montana\u2019s constitutional protections are even stronger than their federal counterparts, transgender youth in Montana can sleep easier tonight knowing that they can continue to thrive for now, without this looming threat hanging over their heads.\u201d",
      "Chase Scheuer, press secretary for Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen, said the office looks forward to \u201cdefending the case on its merits, which will include recent scientific developments ignored by this court.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Supreme Court has abandoned Montanans once again to rule in favor of their out-of-state political allies,\u201d Scheuer said in an emailed statement. \u201cIn upholding the district court\u2019s flawed decision to temporarily block a duly enacted law, the Supreme Court put the wellbeing of children -- who have yet to reach puberty -- at risk by allowing experimental treatments that could leave them to deal with serious and irreversible consequences for the rest of their lives to continue.\u201d",
      "Doctors treat gender dysphoria \u2014 the distress that results when a person\u2019s gender identity is in conflict with their gender assigned at birth \u2014 on a case-by-case basis, but minors who do pursue medical transition begin puberty blockers, which temporarily stop puberty, at its onset.",
      "Montana\u2019s Republican-controlled Legislature passed a law in April 2023 prohibiting health care providers from using puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgery to treat minors with dysphoria. The law also prohibits Medicaid from covering such treatments for trans minors.",
      "When Marks issued a preliminary injunction against the law last year, he wrote that it was likely unconstitutional and that \u201cbarring access to gender-affirming care would negatively impact gender dysphoric minors\u2019 mental and physical health.\u201d",
      "He also noted that the same Legislature, which described puberty blockers and hormone therapy as \u201cexperimental,\u201d had passed a law giving patients, including minors, the right to receive treatment with experimental drugs if they consent and the treatment is recommended by a health care provider, The Associated Press reported.",
      "In upholding the injunction, Montana Supreme Court Justice Beth Baker wrote in the majority opinion that the Legislature \u201cdid not make gender-affirming care unlawful,\u201d nor \u201cdid it make the treatments unlawful for all minors,\u201d as minors can still receive the treatments for other reasons.",
      "\u201cInstead, it restricted a broad swath of medical treatments only when sought for a particular purpose,\u201d Baker wrote, adding that the law \u201cputs governmental regulation in the mix of an individual\u2019s fundamental right \u2018to make medical judgments affecting her or his bodily integrity and health in partnership with a chosen health care provider.\u2019\u201d",
      "All seven state Supreme Court justices agreed with the decision to uphold the injunction. Two issued a separate concurring opinion, arguing that the court should have made clear that discrimination based on transgender status is a type of sex discrimination prohibited by the equal protection clause of Montana\u2019s Constitution. One issued a partial dissent, arguing that the court should\u2019ve allowed the portion of the law prohibiting Medicaid coverage of trans care for minors to take effect, because \u201cthere is no current federal mandate for Medicaid funding of gender-affirming care.\u201d",
      "Montana is one of 26 states that has passed a law restricting transition-related care for minors, according to the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ think tank. Montana garnered international headlines last year when state lawmakers were debating the law. State Rep. Zooey Zephyr, the first trans woman elected to Montana\u2019s Legislature, was censured in a party-line vote after telling her colleagues that they would have blood on their hands if they supported the restriction on trans care.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court took up such restrictions for the first time last week, when it heard arguments over a similar law in Tennessee. It is expected to issue a decision this summer."

And I was like, \u2018OK, this is our sunset era, like this might be done.\u2019",
      "\"And then, as soon as we started shooting again, and Jeremiah reminded us all of just how special it is, what we\u2019re doing \u2026 it felt like the first day of joy again,\" he continues.",
      "In November 2023, Berk announced with a \u201cheavy heart\u201d that Season Eight would be his last on \"Queer Eye,\" which was rebooted in 2018 with a new cast after the initial run of Bravo's \"Queer Eye for the Straight Guy\" in the early 2000s. The design expert explained the reason for his departure in a January 2024 Vanity Fair interview and confirmed that there had been tension between him and his co-star France.",
      "That, paired with an explosive Rolling Stone expos\u00e9 in March that alleged controversy between the \"Queer Eye\" members, left them in a difficult place as they began to film Season Nine. But Jonathan Van Ness recalls Brent showing up to shoot in March and creating a \u201csafe\u201d and \u201cvulnerable\u201d space.",
      "\u201cJeremiah really just went out of his way to be like, 'You\u2019re safe here,'\" the stylist describes. \"He gave us all of these quartz just to signify transparency and openness and safety and, like, I\u2019m a big rock girl.\"",
      "Brent also acknowledges his love of crystals during the first episode of Season Nine, which takes place in Las Vegas.",
      "Karamo Brown chimes in to say he's ready for \"another seven years\" of the series as they start this new beginning with Brent, who feels just as excited about his new \"family.\"",
      "Brent says that he hopes the new season reminds viewers of how \u201cgreat\u201d his castmates are.",
      "\"I sat there every day (of filming) in complete awe of what they do, you know, watching people create, love, connect, share, build, grow. It was just wild,\" Brent recalls. \"And they're so much better than you think they are, like, they're even better.\"",
      "\"Queer Eye,\" which centers around improving the lives of people with moving backstories, premiered six years ago with France, Berk, Van Ness, Brown and Antoni Porowski. In Season Nine, Brent brings his interior design experience to the table, which is just one piece of his already impressive resume that includes starring in several TV series alongside his husband, Nate Berkus, and authoring his first book, \"The Space That Keeps You.\"",
      "In a December episode of \u201cWatch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen,\u201d Brent revealed that he had no contact with Berk after he was announced as his replacement, and that they\u2019ve never met.",
      "During his TODAY.com interview, Brent says it \"was not hard\" to jump right into his inaugural season of \"Queer Eye,\" due to his co-stars being masters of their specific trades.",
      "\"My only job when I started here was making sure that they knew that I was going to earn their trust,\" he says, to which Brown responds, \"And did he do the work.\""

      "One user dressed similarly to Grainge and mimicked the model\u2019s dance moves. She captioned the clip, \u201ci just love them okay!!!!!\u201d Another user did the dance in a fur coat. One said she was \u201cpracticing\u201d her Sofia Richie dance in the kitchen \u2014 and another did it on the kitchen counter. Yet another did it on the streets of New York. A group of women did it at a bar: \u201cPeak girlhood,\u201d the caption read.",
      "What\u2019s the controversy?",
      "It\u2019s not apparent that Grainge actually intended to start a trend.\u00a0TODAY.com has reached out to Grainge for comment.",
      "Whereas other dance trends are sparked by deliberate choreography, Grainge may have been \u201cvibing,\u201d as one TikToker said in her her analysis. She \u201cjust has rhythm,\u201d another TikToker said.",
      "\u201cSo this is the dance everyone\u2019s talking about? Just a little shimmy?\u201d one creator said, likening Grainge's moves to a dance you do when you\u2019re \u201cliterally about to leave\u201d a club.",
      "Some people in the comments are baffled by what the fuss is all about. \u201cIsn\u2019t this how everyone dances?\u201d one wrote in a roundup of videos. \u201cI\u2019m so confused,\u201d said another.",
      "A creator posted a parody video of what she thought the \u201cSofia Richie dance\u201d would be, given the hype. In it, she goes through a series of exaggerated, sped-up moves. People in the comments agreed with her take. One comment read, \u201cI was expecting a full routine\u201d from Grainge \u2014 but maintained that the video was \u201ccute.\u201d",
      "The trend demonstrates enduring Grainge\u2019s status as \u201cit girl,\u201d capable of launching trends with a single shimmy. Critics also say the trend could signal the \u201cdeath of originality,\u201d as a Mamamia writer put it.",
      "One creator summed the entire debacle up like this: \u201cDo you guys not have rhythm? My girl was just vibing. You guys have to put a name on everything.\u201d"

      "What was the inspiration behind the name of your latest album?",
      "I picked Patterns because I feel like, thematically, it kind of encompasses the whole record. It\u2019s very much a love letter to self-assessment. I started writing this album when I was 30. I\u2019m 31 now, and it kind of covers that chunk of my life. Naturally, we kind of look a little more introspectively into ourselves and analyze where we\u2019re at, and what we love about our life and our surroundings, and then what we want to kind of evolve into.",
      "What was it like to work with an all-woman team for this record?",
      "I was lucky enough to work with only women on this record \u2014 four of them, Jessie Jo Dillon, Karen Fairchild, Hillary Lindsey, and Alysa Vanderheym. And the reason that came to be \u2014 it was not this pre-calculated idea. I honestly knew that to start writing a record, I needed to feel safe, and so I called my friends, who just happened to be incredible pillars in music. We went away to a retreat outside of St. Louis, and it was just womanhood with some wine. A lot of music came out of it, and that is \u201cPatterns.\u201d",
      "Do you have a message for your fellow \u201cVoice\u201d coaches?",
      "You know, it\u2019s such a love fest this season. There\u2019s so much love and respect, especially amongst the coaches. But don\u2019t think that I don\u2019t want to win! Listen, I know that I\u2019m the girl. I know that I\u2019m new. I know you guys have like, 85 years on me. That\u2019s the vibe.",
      "What\u2019s another creative avenue you want to explore in the future?",
      "I really do love cooking. I want to get better at it because I\u2019m Italian. So, I really gotta dig my heels into the pasta realm. I want to host. That\u2019s my thing. When my friends come over, I\u2019m always just like, \u201cWhat do you want to eat, to drink? Like, what do you need? Sweatpants? What can I get you?\u201d I think that\u2019s part of my love language.",
      "What was it like working with boyfriend Chase Stokes for the \u201cFirst Rodeo\u201d music video?",

I mean, the song is about him, and that moment of kind of surrendering to the idea of falling in love again. And it\u2019s interesting. It\u2019s like this delicate balance, where we love being able to share our relationship, but also we want to protect it at the same time. So I\u2019m really proud of how we were able to just gently put \u201cus\u201d into the video together. But still, you know, we don\u2019t want to exploit it \u2014 our relationship. I just wanted his heart in it.",
      "What is your best advice on how to successfully slide into someone\u2019s DMs?",
      "Am I known for this now? Am I a DM slider?",
      "You just have to shoot your shot, because I think the worst thing that can happen is it doesn\u2019t work out, and that means it\u2019s not meant to be. But you\u2019re coming from a place of empowerment. No harm, no foul. Shoot your shot. Send the DM, send the text.",

And we\u2019ve just gotten into town in New York from rehearsals. So, I think I just want to be present. I want to give this record a life for the first time, and to do it on that stage at MSG, which I\u2019ve never played before ... I mean, it\u2019s one for the books. For me, I\u2019ll remember it for the rest of my life.",
      "What can your fans expect from your upcoming tour?",
      "We have a hydraulic lift. We have some movement. We have a little pyro. Mostly it\u2019s a show that I wanted to feel very all-encompassing. It\u2019s very visual-heavy, and I just want people to feel like you\u2019re stepping into a different world for an hour and a half. Whether you\u2019re more connected to yourself, or the person that you\u2019re with, or us on stage, I just want you to feel connected. And so we\u2019ve really tried to curate the whole night to feel like that.",
      "If you could form a super group with two other country artists, who would you choose?",
      "I would pick Carly Pearce, because we\u2019re just real life friends. I love her so much. And I would pick Shania (Twain), because I think we both just love her. We would let her sing the whole time, and we\u2019d just hold down the background vocals.",
      "Rapid fire round:",

      "An oat milk latte with one pump of pumpkin spice. Just one \u2014 just enough just to get a whiff of fall.",
      "My favorite karaoke song to perform is Kelly Clarkson's \"Since You\u2019ve Been Gone,\" because no one can really sing that, except for Kelly Clarkson.",
      "What\u2019s not Virgo about me? I love a plan. I\u2019m a control freak. I\u2019m very tidy in the way that I operate in a career space. But if you saw my bathroom or my closet, that\u2019s not very Virgo of me. It\u2019s just open suitcases, clothes everywhere. But my boyfriend is also a Virgo, and he\u2019s the same way. So I wonder how that works. I should talk to an astrologist about that.",
      "The last show I watched and loved was \u201cNobody Wants This\u201d on Netflix. I already die for Kristen Bell, but I just feel like the way that that show was written and represented, like a modern relationship, was just so yummy. I\u2019m such a fan."

    "summary": "Golden Bachelor Gerry Turner says that he has cancer and it led to his breakup from Theresa Nist. Here's what happened.",
    "story": [
      "Gerry Turner is sharing a sobering update on his health.",
      "The \"Golden Bachelor\" star revealed that he has an incurable form of bone marrow cancer called Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia and said the diagnosis played a part in his breakup with Theresa Nist, whom he married on live TV in January 2024.",
      "Turner, 72, shared the news in an interview with People.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, there\u2019s no cure for it. So that weighs heavily in every decision I make,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like 10 tons of concrete were just dropped on me. And I was a bit in denial for a while, I didn\u2019t want to admit to it.\u201d",
      "Per the Mayo Clinic, Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia is a form of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma that originates in the white blood cells, transforming some of them into cancer cells that build up in bone marrow. The Mayo Clinic said this type of cancer grows slowly and \"may not cause symptoms for years.\"",
      "At first hesitant to speak about the cancer, Turner said he felt compelled to after getting involved with charities. He also thought going public with his diagnosis might \"clear up a lot of mystery\" surrounding his split from Nist in the spring of 2024.",
      "After getting engaged on the ABC dating series \u201cThe Golden Bachelor,\u201d the couple tied the knot in a live televised ceremony in January 2024. Three months later, in April, Turner filed for divorce.",
      "During an interview on ABC at the time, Turner said the decision came out of a \"number of heart-to-heart conversations\" about \"our situation, our living situation, so forth.\" Together, he said they decided \"it's probably time for us to \u2014 dissolve our marriage.\"",
      "Turner gave further context to the decision in his People interview.",
      "\u201cAs Theresa and I were trying very hard to find our lifestyle and where we were going to live and how we were going to make our life work, I was unfortunately diagnosed with cancer,\u201d Turner told People.",
      "The father of two first started the journey to being diagnosed when he went to an orthopedic surgeon to address an old shoulder injury. After the doctor pointed out \"some unusual blood markers,\" Turner started the process of seeking answers, which led him to an oncologist.",
      "Initially, oncologists suspected that the reality star had a \"blood disorder.\" Following several rounds of testing, including a bone marrow biopsy, Turner got an official diagnosis and shared the news with his new wife.",
      "\u201cCertainly, it was hard for me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the conversation was brief and I think (she was) a little bit awestruck by the news. So understandable.\u201d",
      "At the time, Turner and Nist \u2014 who live in Indiana and New Jersey, respectively \u2014 were in the process of figuring out where they would settle down.",
      "Turner decided that uprooting his life after his diagnosis wasn't the best route.",
      "\u201cI wanted my life to continue on as normal as possible, and that led me to believing that as normal as possible more meant spending time with my family, my two daughters, my two son-in-laws, my granddaughters,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the importance of finding the way with Theresa was still there, but it became less of a priority.\u201d",
      "After the couple announced their divorce, speculation ran rampant about what led to their breakup.",
      "Now that he's sharing his diagnosis, Turner hopes that the public will \u201clook at things a little bit differently.\"",
      "\u201cWhen you are hit with that kind of news and the shock wears off after a few days or a few weeks and you regroup and you realize what\u2019s important to you, that\u2019s where you start to move forward,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd I hope that people understand in retrospect now that that had a huge bearing on my decisions and I think probably Theresa\u2019s as well.\u201d",
      "Turner wishes nothing but \"all of the good luck in the world\" for Nist, calling their journey together a \"cherished memory.\"",
      "\u201cIt was wonderful, and I certainly wish it would\u2019ve had a different ending, that we would\u2019ve found our way, that we would\u2019ve found solutions to a problem. And most of all, that I would not have had a diagnosis that so strongly influenced my decisions and the direction I went,\" he said.",
      "Nist, on her end, shared a different story with the publication. Nist said she was \"extremely upset\" after finding out about the cancer. But from her experience, Turner's cancer \"wasn't a factor\" in ending the relationship \u2014 \"at least not for me,\" she said.",
      "\u201cIf that was something on his part, maybe, I don\u2019t know. But no, that didn\u2019t factor into ending the relationship,\u201d she said. \u201cPart of it was the distance, but that wasn\u2019t the only part. That\u2019s really all I will say.\u201d",
      "This follows a cryptic remark in a November 2024 interview on the podcast \u201cAlmost Famous.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou really can\u2019t know somebody in four weeks. I\u2019ll just say that,\u201d she said, and added \u201cnot just the location thing\u201d led to their divorce.",
      "Nist told People she wishes her ex-husband the best. \u201cI wish him the best and that I know that he was in a very difficult situation and that good things will come to him,\u201d she said."

    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 18:58:53 GMT",
    "summary": "The hit Christmas song by Jos\u00e9 Feliciano was born out of loneliness. Learn the 'Feliz Navidad' lyrics in English and Spanish, and the song's history.",
    "story": [
      "I stared out the car window as my mom drove our Dodge Dart through the desert night. I was 10 years old, and my family was on a trip from Los Angeles to El Paso, Texas, to visit my grandpa for the holidays. Beside my mom, Aunt Emma was asleep in the front seat, and so were my brothers next to me in the back. Then the AM radio crackled. \u201cFeliz Navidad,\u201d a man sang. \u201cI wanna wish you a merry Christmas, from the bottom of my heart!\u201d",
      "My mother hummed along with the melody. That song seemed like a beacon, the sound of people like us coming over the airwaves. We were in an old car on a dark road in the middle of nowhere. But with my family so close, and \u201cFeliz Navidad\u201d on the radio, it felt like the safest place in the world.",
      "As a kid in the 1970s, I assumed that the voice behind \u201cFeliz Navidad\u201d was Mexican American like me. In fact, singer Jos\u00e9 Feliciano was born in 1945 in Puerto Rico. He wrote \u201cFeliz Navidad\u201d in 10 minutes and recorded it in one take, he once told The New Yorker. The novelty song that has become a holiday staple was released in 1970, when Richard Nixon was president, the Vietnam War was raging, and Hispanic Heritage Month didn\u2019t exist yet.",
      "For Feliciano, \u201cFeliz Navidad\u201d represented a comeback. After coming to prominence with his rendition of \u201cLight My Fire\u201d in 1968, he performed an unconventional version of the national anthem at the World Series. This generated a backlash that nearly derailed his career. Luckily, two years later Feliciano charmed his way back into the public eye with \u201cFeliz Navidad.\u201d",
      "Although I grew up in an assimilated household, where my family spoke English at home, it was still special to hear Feliciano\u2019s bilingual song every year. Before Latinos were a regular presence on TV and radio, we would hear him and feel like, in a sense, he was us.",
      "I was in sixth grade the year that my older brother got a movie camera for Christmas. His present sparked a performance in our living room by my Aunt Lela, the free spirit of the family. Wearing a cape fashioned from wrapping paper, she belted out her own version of \u201cFeliz Navidad.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is my first live Christmas special!\u201d she exclaimed. My cousins and I clapped along as the adults rolled their eyes. \u201cFeliz Navidad\u201d was perfect for my aunt \u2014 and for everyone \u2014 because anybody can sing it.",
      "The genius of \u201cFeliz Navidad\u201d is its simplicity. It has only 19 words, 13 in English and six in Spanish. (The English: I wanna wish you a merry Christmas/ From the bottom of my heart. The Spanish: Feliz Navidad/ Pr\u00f3spero a\u00f1o y felicidad. Translated, it means merry Christmas and happy new year.) Feliciano repeats them for three minutes, long enough to craft a bouncy earworm. If you listen closely, you can hear the strings of the cuatro, an instrument derived from the guitar that often accompanies Christmas carols in Puerto Rico.",
      "Like \u201cAll I Want for Christmas Is You\u201d by Mariah Carey, \u201cFeliz Navidad\u201d has become one of the best-known holiday songs of all time. It has been covered by artists including Luciano Pavarotti, Celine Dion and Latin superstar Thalia. For many Latinos, it is not officially the Christmas season until we\u2019ve heard this song.",
      "Ironically, Feliciano has stated in interviews that this song was born of loneliness. He was in an L.A. studio over the holidays, missing his family, when he wrote and recorded it.",
      "I learned what it was like to feel melancholy at Christmas in 2020, during the pandemic. Instead of spending the holidays in California with my family, I stayed home in New York City. I took solo walks in Central Park and stared out the window a lot. One day, I was so lonely that I went and sat at the bus stop even though I wasn\u2019t even waiting for a bus.",
      "In the evenings, when I listened to streaming radio, there was \u201cFeliz Navidad.\u201d It was only then that I detected a yearning in Feliciano\u2019s voice. That year, the song struck me as bittersweet; it made me miss my relatives more, while simultaneously reminding me of happier times.",
      "It\u2019s now been over five decades since Feliciano released \u201cFeliz Navidad.\u201d Yet he will always be the original crossover artist who brought Latin sounds into the mainstream, and his most famous song remains the only Spanish-language Christmas classic in the U.S.",
      "These days, when I hear \u201cFeliz Navidad,\u201d it can call up all kinds of emotions. I think of my mom humming to herself, back when a long car trip was a big adventure. I remember my childhood Christmases with my cousins, aunts and my grandpa. I reflect on how amazing it is that this snappy tune has been an annual presence in my life for nearly as long as I\u2019ve been alive. And sometimes, I don\u2019t think about any of these things. I just sing along."

      "When Jamie Foxx experienced \u201ca bad headache,\u201d on April 11, 2023, he visited a doctor who didn\u2019t take his symptoms seriously, giving him a shot of cortisone and sending him on his way, he shared during his stand-up special \u201cJamie Foxx: What Had Happened Was\u2026\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if you can do Yelps for doctors,\u201d he said in his special. \u201cThat\u2019s half a star.\u201d",
      "Luckily, Foxx\u2019s sister, Deidra Dixon, knew something was wrong with her brother and took him to another hospital. There he received emergency surgery for what turned out to be an aneurysm that led to a stroke.",
      "Brain aneurysms are common, TODAY.com previously reported, and many are harmless. However, ones that rupture and bleed, like the one Foxx had, are medical emergencies that require immediate surgery. Bleeding in the brain, also called intracranial hemorrhage, is considered a stroke, the Cleveland Clinic notes. The blood that collects in the brain makes it difficult for oxygen to reach the brain.",
      "According to the Cleveland Clinic symptoms of a ruptured aneurysm include:",
      "A headache that feels like \u201cthe worst headache of (your) life\u201d Facial drooping on one side Weakness or paralysis on one side of the body Trouble speaking Blurry vision or difficulty seeing",

      "Blurry vision or difficulty seeing",
      "\u201cIf those come with a very sudden onset, and in particular, if they come with that headache \u2026 call 911 and head to the hospital right away,\u201d Dr. M. Shazam Hussain, director of Cleveland Clinic\u2019s cerebrovascular center, told TODAY.com in September 2024.",
      "Hussain noted that some people hesitate to visit the hospital because of a headache. However skipping medical care can lead to death in 25% of people with ruptured aneurysms. Even survivors face life-altering changes with about one-third of survivors experiencing severe disability, past TODAY.com reporting says.",
      "\u201cWe heard the story too often where someone had a really bad headache \u2026 and didn\u2019t have any other symptoms \u2026 and unfortunately they wait because they think, \u2018Oh, maybe it\u2019s just a bad headache, a bad migraine,\u201d Hussain said. \u201cThen a day or two later, the aneurysm fully ruptures, you have the mask of bleeding around the brain, and it can be quite devastating.\u201d",
      "In Foxx\u2019s case, his sister\u2019s determination likely made a difference in his outcome.",
      "\u201cMy sister \u2026 said that something\u2019s wrong with my brother,\u201d Foxx said. \u201cThey said she drove around Atlanta sort of aimlessly. She didn\u2019t really know where the hospitals was, but as she was driving around she came upon Piedmont hospital.\u201d",
      "Her instinct about Foxx was right. The doctor at this hospital who evaluated him gave Dixon \u201csome horrible news.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe said, \u2018He\u2019s having a brain bleed that\u2019s led to a stroke, and if I don\u2019t go in his head right now, we\u2019re going to lose him,\u2019\u201d Foxx said.",
      "While surgery stabilized Foxx, doctors couldn\u2019t locate where the bleeding had started in his brain. Still, they felt Foxx would improve and told Dixon: \u201cHe may be able to make a full recovery, but it\u2019s going to be the worst year of his life,\u201d Foxx said.",
      "Still, it\u2019s unclear why Foxx experienced the brain bleeding and stroke.",
      "\u201cIt is a mystery,\u201d he said. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know exactly what happened to me.\u201d",
      "In some cases, it can be unclear why someone might experience a brain aneurysm. People at risk for them include:",

      "\u201cCallas has always been a fascinating character,\u201d Marc A.

Born in 1923 in New York City shortly after her Greek family emigrated, Maria Anna Cecilia Sofa Kalogeropoulos received training in singing in Greece while a teen, then became famous for her \u201cbel canto\u201d style of singing (think of a broad, flexible voice and drama in how she interpreted the music) while in Italy.",
      "\u201cThe palette of vocal colors she could bring to her singing, the nuance of her interpretation, and her emphasis on language in her performances was extraordinarily subtle and powerful,\u201d Scorca says. \u201cIn her prime, she gave 120 percent of what she had to give vocally.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Indiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark has helped take the WNBA to a whole new level of popularity, but she has made sure to remind people that much of the foundation of the league was built by Black stars.",
      "Clark, who was named Time's 2024 Athlete of the Year on Dec. 10, reflected in the publication's story on her achievement about how she views her place in the league's lineage of talent.",
      "\u201cI want to say I\u2019ve earned every single thing, but as a white person, there is privilege,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of those players in the league that have been really good have been Black players. This league has kind of been built on them.\"",
      "\"The more we can appreciate that, highlight that, talk about that, and then continue to have brands and companies invest in those players that have made this league incredible, I think it\u2019s very important,\" she continued. \"I have to continue to try to change that. The more we can elevate Black women, that\u2019s going to be a beautiful thing.\u201d",
      "Clark's comments refer to her white privilege, defined as the inherent and unearned advantages and benefits white people have over non-white people. According to Learning for Justice, white privilege \"exists because of historic, enduring racism and biases.\"",
      "The issue of race often came up during Clark's Rookie of the Year campaign this past season, whether it was her reported rivalry with Chicago Sky star Angel Reese, taking flagrant fouls on the court or her immediate popularity compared to some of the league's established Black stars.",
      "Las Vegas Aces star A'ja Wilson, a three-time WNBA MVP, spoke to Marie Claire magazine in May about the effect Clark's arrival has had on other players.",
      "\u201cI felt like I was mentally tired in that whole whirlwind of people constantly saying, \u2018A\u2019ja you\u2019re only known because of Caitlin; we\u2019re only here because of Caitlin,\u2019\u201d Wilson said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s great, I get that, but while you\u2019re here I\u2019m not going to let you discredit me or the work that I\u2019ve done, or my teammates or the people who came before have done.\u201d",
      "Wilson also told The Associated Press that she believes Clark's race is \"a huge thing\" when it comes to her popularity.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of people may say it\u2019s not about Black and white, but to me, it is,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really is because you can be top notch at what you are as a Black woman, but yet maybe that\u2019s something that people don\u2019t want to see.\"",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t see it as marketable, so it doesn\u2019t matter how hard I work. It doesn\u2019t matter what we all do as Black women, we\u2019re still going to be swept underneath the rug. That\u2019s why it boils my blood when people say it\u2019s not about race because it is.\u201d",
      "Black players like Sheryl Swoopes, Lisa Leslie, Candace Parker, Cynthia Cooper and Maya Moore helped establish the WNBA as a top women's basketball league in the world. The WNBA has also had white stars before Clark, from Sue Bird to Breanna Stewart.",
      "Clark didn't believe any hard fouls against her by Black players had anything to do with her popularity.",
      "\u201cI never thought I was being targeted,\u201d she told Time. \u201cObviously, that shouldn\u2019t ever happen within a game. But basketball is physical. Your emotions can get the best of you. My emotions have gotten the best of me many times.\u201d",
      "She also tries not to give oxygen to those looking to make any confrontations or rivalries on the court about race.",
      "\"A lot of people that wanted to have opinions on what was happening probably didn\u2019t even watch half the games that they were trying to have a take on and hadn\u2019t supported the W for a really long time,\u201d she said."

      "The reason why I wanted to stay the whole time was because I had made a marriage commitment that I was committed to. Some might say now that I was never loyal, but obviously I was \u2014 I\u2019m just saying \u2014 because I stuck with it and I wanted to work through it and figure it out. That\u2019s where my commitment level was.",
      "Conversations that he was finally willing to have with me. I know that he just was not having the conversations with me because he didn\u2019t want to deal with it. It was easier to set it aside.",
      "When we really started having conversations and he was actually honest with me to my face, which I deserve, (things shifted). There are a lot of people who are like, \u201cWhy\u2019d you stay so long? He was saying it to the world forever.\u201d It\u2019s like, yeah, he was, but I deserved to hear it. Maybe it was just a little bit of, \u201cYou\u2019re stuck with me until you say it to my face.\u201d",
      "I don\u2019t have any regrets of how it played out because there was so much that I learned about myself in the process that I\u2019m glad about.",
      "I\u2019m confident in my decision of when we decided to split because there\u2019s no question on either of our parts. He might have been there sooner and I didn\u2019t know about it. But for me, I was able to learn a lot about myself. There\u2019s no point in having regrets because you wouldn\u2019t be the person that you are had you not gone through the experiences that you did."

      "While talking to Hoda Kotb on the Dec. 11 episode of her \"Making Space\" podcast, he said he knew it was time for him and his bandmate, Brian Kelley, to part ways because it felt as if life was pulling him in a different direction.",
      "\"2020 hit. I thought I was on my journey for \u2014\u00a0we were riding off into the sunset. I had a lot of success with FGL. And God had a different plan. Pretty quickly I learned that, OK, FGL, the season of being in a band and a duo is coming to an end,\" he said. \"I guess God has something different for me, so I tried to embrace it. But it was the year that we were all kind of just figuring out life at the time. What\u2019s happening? Will I ever even play shows again?\"",
      "Hubbard explained that it was that year that everything started to change for him. Not only did he welcome his third child, Atlas Roy, 4, with wife Hayley, he also ruptured his Achilles and \"couldn't walk for, like, eight months.\"",
      "\"Needless to say, I was really humbled changing a lot of diapers, sitting at home, wondering if I was ever going to be onstage again,\" he said. \"But yeah, we pushed through. We had a great season and now we\u2019re on the other side.\"",

You go through a great time \u2014 but it can\u2019t stay great forever, so you sort of do the cycle and let life lead,\" he said.",

      "\"But once I dove off into it, I\u2019m like, man, this is actually what made me fall in love with this the first time and it's doing it again,\" he continued. \"And so it\u2019s just the excitement of the build and the challenge. I\u2019ve found that that\u2019s where I really thrive and enjoy life.\""

      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol vowed Thursday to \u201cfight to the end\u201d as he faces calls to step down over his failed attempt to impose martial law, defending his actions and lashing out at his political opponents in a defiant speech.",
      "In a lengthy national address, Yoon accused \u201canti-state forces\u201d in the opposition-controlled parliament of paralyzing the government and undermining the rule of law. He largely repeated comments he made last week when he announced the surprise martial law order, saying it was necessary to protect democracy.",
      "\u201cThe opposition parties are currently going berserk, claiming that the declaration of martial law equates to insurrection,\u201d Yoon said. \u201cIs what they claim true?\u201d",
      "Yoon apologized again \u201cfor causing surprise and anxiety\u201d with his martial law declaration, and said that \u201cwhether they impeach me or investigate me, I will stand firm.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers are voting Saturday on a second motion to impeach Yoon, after the first one failed when members of his conservative People Power Party (PPP) boycotted the vote. The party\u2019s leader appeared to reverse his stance after Yoon\u2019s address on Thursday and said that the president must be impeached, although the party remains divided.",
      "Yoon said the opposition had tried to bring down his administration by pursuing the impeachment of dozens of government officials since he took office in 2022 for a single five-year term, leading many to resign.",
      "\u201cImpeached officials are suspended from office for a long period of time \u2014 until the verdicts are handed down \u2014 even if they are found to be not at fault,\u201d he said.",
      "Characterizing the opposition as abusing their constitutional authority, Yoon said he decided to exercise his presidential authority in line with the country\u2019s constitution.",
      "He said his actions \u201cwere designed not to destroy the constitutional order and the constitution, but to protect and restore them, and to inform the public of this disastrous crisis for our country.\u201d",
      "Yoon said he discussed his plans to declare emergency martial law only with his minister of national defense, and that many of the staff and cabinet members he informed right before the declaration expressed opposition to it.",
      "Without providing evidence, Yoon also said for the first time that communist-ruled North Korea, which technically remains at war with the South, hacked into South Korea\u2019s National Election Commission last year.",
      "He said the independent agency had refused to cooperate with investigators and inspectors seeking to safeguard its system, and that the inspections that were carried out found security shortcomings. Yoon said that raised questions about the integrity of the results of April\u2019s parliamentary election, which the liberal opposition won in a landslide.",
      "The National Election Commission, which was one of the places where martial law troops were deployed last week, disputed Yoon\u2019s allegations.",
      "\u201cThe presidential address confirmed that the martial law forces entered the Election Management Commission illegally and attempted to steal our server, which is an unconstitutional and illegal activity,\u201d the commission said in a statement.",
      "Yoon, 63, who once served as the country\u2019s chief prosecutor, is under criminal investigation over the short-lived martial law declaration, which plunged the East Asian democracy and key U.S. ally into chaos. The order banned all political activity and censored the news media, and troops were deployed to the legislature in Seoul, the South Korean capital.",
      "Lawmakers defied a security cordon around the building to vote unanimously to reject the order, which Yoon lifted early Dec. 4, about six hours after he announced it.",
      "In his speech on Thursday, Yoon said \u201ca contingent of fewer than 300 soldiers without lethal weapons\u201d\u00a0had been sent to the National Assembly \u201cto maintain order\u201d as large numbers of protesters and lawmakers rushed to the building after the martial law announcement.",
      "He denied that the troops, who withdrew after the vote by lawmakers, had been deployed \u201cto disperse the National Assembly or paralyze its functions.\u201d",
      "\u201cMilitary officers have done nothing wrong,\u201d Yoon said. \u201cThey were simply following my orders to move troops after the declaration.\u201d",
      "Yoon\u2019s comments on Thursday were his first since he apologized for issuing the order on Saturday ahead of the first impeachment vote, saying he would leave his fate in the hands of his party.",
      "The PPP says that Yoon has effectively been suspended from duty and that it will \u201crestore order\u201d by ensuring his early departure from office, working with Prime Minister Han Duck-soo in the meantime to manage state affairs. But opposition lawmakers and much of the public are demanding that Yoon step down immediately, with a survey released on Thursday showing more than 7 out of 10 respondents supporting his removal from office, according to the Yonhap news agency.",
      "Yoon\u2019s hold on power and his party appears to be slipping.",
      "\u201cBasically, the speech was a rationalization of this situation and de facto confession that he has committed rebellion,\u201d PPP leader Han Dong-hoon said after Yoon\u2019s address on Thursday. \u201cI propose that PPP adopt voting for the impeachment as our party platform.\u201d",
      "Han added that he was ordering an emergency meeting to expel Yoon from the party.",
      "\u201cI believe this is the time to make clear where we stand,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a very serious situation, and what he said in his national address cannot be accepted by the people, and we also cannot accept it from the standpoint of democracy.\u201d",
      "The PPP\u2019s newly elected floor leader, Kweon Seong-dong, said he continued to oppose impeachment as well as convening the ethics committee over Yoon\u2019s party membership.",
      "\u201cI believe we should let the president decide for himself whether to stay with the party or leave it,\u201d said Kweon, a veteran politician who is close with Yoon.",
      "Roh Jong-myung, a spokesperson for the main opposition Democratic Party, said that while it was a positive sign that Han recognized the seriousness of the situation, \u201che is too late.\u201d",
      "The next impeachment vote is set to be held Saturday around 5 p.m. local time (3 a.m. ET). Though the opposition controls parliament, it is eight seats short of the 200 it needs for the bill to pass, and it remains unclear whether lawmakers from Yoon\u2019s party will attend the vote.",
      "If Yoon is impeached, he will be suspended from office while the Constitutional Court holds a trial, leaving the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy in political uncertainty potentially for months.",
      "Since the martial law declaration, lawmakers have also sought to impeach other officials accused of failing to prevent it, including the justice minister and national police chief.",
      "A government spokesperson on Tuesday implored the opposition to refrain from further impeaching officials to avoid creating a power vacuum, noting that resignations had already left top public security positions vacant.",
      "\u201cWe must prevent a situation in which stable governance becomes impossible,\u201d said the spokesperson, Culture Minister Yoo In-chon. \u201cOnly then can we maintain trust with allies such as the U.S., Japan and other friendly nations.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "With the balance of power in northern Syria swinging toward the rebels who toppled the Assad regime, U.S.-backed Kurdish forces and their ability to contain ISIS may now be under threat.",
      "The Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) \u2014 which helped the U.S. beat back the Islamic State terrorist group and currently holds thousands of captured ISIS fighters \u2014 accepted a cease-fire Tuesday with the Turkey-backed Syrian National Army (SNA), ceding control of the northern city of Manbij, a Kurdish stronghold.",
      "\u201cWe have reached a ceasefire agreement in Manbij with American mediation, to preserve the security and safety of civilians,\u201d the SDF's general commander, Mazloum Abdi, said Tuesday in a post on X. \u201cFighters \u2026 will be removed from the area as soon as possible. Our goal is to cease fire throughout Syria and enter into a political process for the future of the country.\u201d",
      "The takeover of Manbij, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham \u2014 or HTS, which has roots in extremist Islamist movements \u2014 reflects the rapidly shifting situation across Syria, including for Kurdish forces.",
      "While Israel has taken the opportunity to destroy Syrian naval ships in the west, as well as buildings linked to chemical weapons outside Damascus, the fall of Assad and the rise of HTS could scarcely have gone better for the Turkish government of President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan.",
      "Erdo\u011fan is HTS\u2019s key backer. He has long viewed the SDF as an extension of Turkey\u2019s Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and designates both as terrorist organizations. And while Syria\u2019s Kurds have, since 2011, largely defended their autonomy in the northeastern corner of Syria that borders Turkey and Iraq, the political winds have shifted against the SDF.",
      "\u201cThe Kurds in Syria, after many years of autonomous rule, are in probably the most precarious and volatile environment since they developed those structures,\u201d said Renad Mansour, a senior research fellow on the Middle East and North Africa program at the London-based think tank Chatham House.",
      "Kurdish forces have made arrangements with several different groups over the past decade, Mansour told NBC News, but \u201cthis colossal change in Syria will see them have to renegotiate this, and probably negotiations will be through violence.\u201d",
      "It took U.S. mediation to broker an armistice between the SDF and the SNA, amid a visit from Army Gen. Erik Kurilla, head of U.S. Central Command, and before Secretary of State Anthony Blinken\u2019s trip to Turkey.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve worked alongside the SDF for some time. That work continues,\u201d Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters in Japan on Wednesday. \u201cWe have a good relationship with them, and I think it will remain.\u201d",
      "But the words of America\u2019s incoming president will not have escaped the attention of the SDF leadership.",
      "\u201cSyria is a mess, but is not our friend,\u201d President-elect Donald Trump said in a post on X last week, adding in all caps: \u201cThe United States should have nothing to do with it. This is not our fight. Let it play out. Do not get involved!\u201d",
      "The early signs from the incoming Trump administration are that there will be two schools of thought regarding Syria, Mansour said. \u201cOne camp recognizes the historic fight with the Kurds against ISIS \u2026 and of course the other camp \u2014 where Trump probably lands \u2014 is to try and move out of Syria,\u201d he said.",
      "There are thought to be thousands of ISIS fighters being held in prisons and internally displaced person camps monitored by Kurdish groups and U.S. forces in Syria\u2019s northeast \u2014 an area that used to constitute part of the Islamic State\u2019s territory.",
      "If a second Trump administration were to pull out of Syria, it would leave Kurdish forces without a major international ally. HTS and its allies, meanwhile, have the backing of Turkey and Erdo\u011fan, who on Monday welcomed ejection of \u201cterrorists\u201d from Manbij, according to Reuters.",
      "There are already signals of further clashes. Kobani, to the northeast of Manbij, \u201cremains at risk of war due to continuous provocations by Turkey and its jihadist mercenaries,\u201d SDF media chief Farhad Shami told NBC News on Wednesday."

      "More recently, however, Jolani, who now uses his real name, Ahmad al-Sharaa, has undergone something of a rebrand, trimming his beard, donning Westernized green fatigues and espousing tolerance for all of Syria\u2019s myriad faiths. Nevertheless plenty of observers are reserving judgment until these words become actions.",
      "\u201cI think we should be very cautious of him,\u201d said Bilal Sukkar, a Syrian-born senior associate with the London-based intelligence consultancy S-RM. That trepidation goes for \u201cnot only respecting the rights of people belonging to other religious and sectarian groups,\u201d he said, \u201cbut actually looking at them as equal citizens.\u201d",
      "Seeing Syria\u2019s corridors of power welcome a flag \u201cindicating Islamist-Salafist leanings\u201d has \u201cput people on alert,\u201d Sukkar said. Although he does not think deploying the emblem was a \u201cwise\u201d move, he sees it as more reflective of the rebels\u2019 origins in Idlib rather than anything else.",
      "Such demographic accommodations are a huge deal in Syria, which is \u201chome to a vast diversity of religious and ethnic groups,\u201d according to the Harvard Divinity School. Some 74% of the population are Sunni Muslims, another 13% belong to other sects, such as Shia and Alawite, and 10% are Christian.",
      "The classic worry among Western foreign policy watchers was that Assad might be toppled but replaced by something that is not much better: an extremist terror group.",
      "Assad\u2019s regime was, rightly or wrongly, seen internationally as one of brutal secularism and relative interreligious tolerance. By contrast, HTS has in the past explicitly defined itself as Islamist, meaning it seeks to reorder society along Islamic law.",
      "Displaying the flag in an image meant to represent Syria\u2019s new transition government shows how HTS and Jolani are still \u201cdeeply entrenched in their Salafist-Sunni ideology and worldview,\u201d according to Fawaz Gerges, a professor at the London School of Economics and author of the 2024 book, \u201cWhat Really Went Wrong: The West and the Failure of Democracy in the Middle East.\u201d",
      "They are not going to rule Syria with the brutality of the Islamic State terrorist group or the Taliban, Gerges added, \u201cbut it would be disingenuous to say he has shedded his ideology.\u201d",
      "Gerges is among observers who see the presence of the flag as a signal that the militant group is intent on keeping its imprimatur on the new era it helped birth. Al-Bashir, chosen after a meeting with Jolani, says he will only be in post until March. But it\u2019s not clear what happens then.",
      "There have been positive early signals, including an edict that women should not be told what they can and cannot wear, as well as a plea for people not to seek vigilante vengeance.",
      "\u201cWe will guarantee the rights of all people and all communities in Syria,\u201d al-Bashir told the Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera on Tuesday. Asked whether the country\u2019s new Constitution would be \u201cIslamic,\u201d he added, \u201cGod willing, we will clarify all these details during the constitutional process.\u201d",
      "With the group now making more moderate noises, and also in a position of considerable influence, the United States is exploring removing HTS\u2019 terrorist designation, two current administration officials and a former senior U.S. official told NBC News. Although Washington will watch closely the militant group\u2019s moves from its new political vantage point.",
      "Some observers, such as Gerges, see the interim prime minister as little more than an Jolani figurehead.",
      "Even inside Syria, he is not a well-known figure. Previously, he ran the government in Idlib province, a small, rural corner of northwestern Syria where rebels maintained control outside Assad\u2019s regime until their stunning offensive.",
      "He heads what is being touted by the incoming officials as a technocratic government; he is a trained electrical engineer and has previously backed the digitization of Idlib\u2019s public services.",
      "He and his officials are now going about the process of auditing and stripping back what they and independent international watchdogs say was a deeply corrupt regime.",
      "Gerges worries that HTS and its leader have already amassed such power that they may be reluctant to relinquish it, and that there is little sign of checks or balances to contain Jolani\u2019s ambitions now that Assad has been toppled.",
      "Syria may be getting \u201crid of a strongman,\u201d he cautioned, \u201cand replacing him with another strongman.\u201d"

    "summary": "Russia is providing sanctuary to Bashar al-Assad, after the swift collapse of the Syrian leader's regime, Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister told NBC News.",
    "story": [
      "Russia is providing sanctuary to Bashar al-Assad, having transported the former Syrian leader there \u201cin the most secure way possible\u201d after the swift collapse of his regime, Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister told NBC News in an exclusive interview Tuesday.",
      "\u201cHe is secured, and it shows that Russia acts as required in such an extraordinary situation,\u201d Sergei Ryabkov said, becoming the first Russian official to confirm Assad\u2019s presence in the country.",
      "\u201cI have no idea what is going on with him right now,\u201d Ryabkov said, adding that it \u201cwould be very wrong for me to elaborate on what happened and how it was resolved.\u201d",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin has been dealt a huge blow by the collapse of a regime to which he gave his full support, helping Assad cling to power after Syria descended into civil war and maintain his family\u2019s brutal dynasty, which began in 1971.",
      "And Ryabkov said Russia would continue to support the Syrian leader whose regime has been accused by human rights groups, whistleblowers and former detainees of attacks with chemical weapons and barrel bombs and other war crimes, as well as murder, systematic torture and the enforced disappearance of tens of thousands of people since the 2011 mass uprising, which sparked that conflict.",
      "\u201cRussia is not a party to the convention that established the International Criminal Court,\u201d Ryabkov said when asked if the Kremlin would hand over Assad for trial.",
      "Syria has not joined the court, which is based in the Hague, Netherlands, and has not accepted its jurisdiction. Russia and China blocked an attempt to impose its jurisdiction in 2014. The United States and Israel also do not recognize the jurisdiction of the ICC, which has no police to enforce its warrants.",
      "Separately, in March 2023, the court issued an arrest warrant for Putin for \u201cwar crimes\u201d in overseeing the unlawful abduction and deportation of children\u00a0from Ukraine to Russia.",
      "And last month, the ICC issued\u00a0arrest warrants\u00a0for Israeli Prime Minister\u00a0Benjamin Netanyahu\u00a0and his former Defense Minister\u00a0Yoav Gallant over alleged crimes against humanity and war crimes in Gaza. Israel\u00a0rejected the charges and the U.S. said it rejected the decision.",
      "Assad \u201cwas accused by the same group of countries and governments that continuously defeat attempts to live their own ways as it happened in Iraq, in Libya and in many more,\u201d Ryabkov said, adding that it was \u201camazing, but it is also very revealing,\u201d that the U.S. \u201cconfigures its reaction and response\u201d depending on whom the court is prosecuting.",
      "Whoever ends up governing Syria, be it the  Hayat Tahrir al-Sham\u00a0(HTS) militant group, which led rebel forces as they stormed across Syria, or someone else, Ryabkov said, Russia \u201cforcefully and strongly\u201d believes that Syria \u201cshould be sovereign, unified and integral.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will not have a situation there, hopefully, that will mean separation of parts of Syria from one another,\u201d he added.",
      "He also urged Israel \u201cto seriously consider what is going on in the Golan Heights,\u201d after Netanyahu ordered his military to seize control of the demilitarized and U.N.-patrolled buffer zone with Syria that was established under a 1974 cease-fire agreement. Israel, Ryabkov said, should observe that agreement and it should \u201cnot infringe\u201d on Syria\u2019s territorial integrity.",
      "One thing Russia did share with the U.S. was concerns about the potential for the re-emergence of the Islamic State terrorist group in Syria, he said.\u00a0The U.S. has launched multiple airstrikes on ISIS targets in Syria, where it maintains a small force.",
      "On a separate matter, Ryabkov added that the Kremlin would \u201cdefinitely be prepared to consider\u201d another prisoner swap, similar to the one in August that resulted in the release of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and three other U.S. residents from Russian captivity.",
      "Deals like this required \u201ca multiphased or multistep approach on both sides,\u201d including in some cases, the pardoning of those serving sentences. Several other countries, including Germany and Slovenia, were involved in the deal mediated by Turkey.",
      "While he did not \u201cwant to pre-empt anything,\u201d Ryabkov said such deals help improve the relationship between Russia and the U.S., adding that a new deal would be \"a healthy step forward, especially at the beginning of the next administration.\u201d"

      "\u201cThe numbers of dead young soldiers lying on fields all over the place are staggering.

The delay tactic will likely pose an obstacle to enacting Trump's proposals, as Republicans won't have a supermajority in the Senate, meaning they will need to rely on some Democratic support. But if the filibuster does pose a roadblock to the president-elect's proposals, Trump told Time, \u201cIf I have even a little bit of trouble, I go to an Executive Order because I can get it done.\u201d",

      "The U.S. government has condemned the Taliban for ordering the suspension of medical education for women and girls in Afghanistan.",
      "\u201cThis directive, the latest in a series of efforts that jeopardize the rights and lives of Afghan women and girls,\u202fis an unjustifiable attack on women\u2019s access to education and health care,\u201d Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement on Wednesday.",
      "Since returning to power in August 2021 following the withdrawal of U.S.-led forces, the Taliban have steadily rolled back women\u2019s rights, including barring girls from attending classes beyond the sixth grade. In August, the Taliban published vice laws that ban women\u2019s voices and bare faces in public in an effort to completely erase Afghan women and girls from public life.",
      "Medical education, including nursing and midwifery, was one of the only forms of education still available to women in the country.",
      "\u201cThese directives, now coupled with excluding women from obtaining a medical education, further jeopardize the health, well-being, safety and lives of not just Afghan women and girls, but all Afghans,\u201d Blinken said.",
      "He called on the Taliban to rescind the order as well as all previous orders \u202f\u201cdenying women the enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Taliban and a spokesperson for the health ministry did not immediately reply to requests for comment on Thursday. But while the Taliban have not officially confirmed the order or publicly commented on the reports, three Taliban officials who spoke to NBC News on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue confirmed it was true.",
      "The directive by Taliban supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada was widely unpopular, according to two Taliban officials and commanders NBC News spoke to on Thursday.",
      "\u201cIt created a lot of unrest and panic in Afghanistan, and our senior leaders and religious scholars are engaged in meetings with [Akhundzada] to request him and convince him to lift the ban,\u201d a senior Taliban leader in the capital Kabul told NBC News.",
      "Officials were trying to convince the supreme leader to change his mind, according to a second leader who spoke from Kandahar, the birthplace of the Taliban in southern Afghanistan.",
      "\u201cEverybody in the Islamic Emirate was shocked when they came to know about this latest decision, to deprive the Afghan women even of medical education,\u201d he said.",
      "Doctors Without Borders (MSF), which operates in the country, said barring women from medical education would have far-reaching consequences for women\u2019s health in Afghanistan, which has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world.",
      "\u201cThere is no health care system without educated female health practitioners,\u201d Mickael Le Paih, the group\u2019s country representative in Afghanistan, said in a statement.",
      "The group said the availability of health care was already affected by an insufficient number of female health care workers in the country, where hospital wards are segregated by gender.",
      "\u201cFor essential services to be available to all genders, they must be delivered by all genders,\u201d Le Paih said.",
      "The Taliban have in some provinces banned women from being treated by male medical workers, meaning the new order \u201cwill result in unnecessary pain, misery, sickness and death for the women forced to go without health care, as there won\u2019t be female health care workers to treat them,\u201d Human Rights Watch said in a statement last week.",
      "According to the United Nations Population Fund, Afghanistan urgently needs an additional 18,000 midwives to meet demand.",
      "Blinken\u2019s statement on Wednesday came as he testified before the Republican-led House Foreign Affairs Committee, whose members have strongly criticized the Biden administration\u2019s handling of the disastrous U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, including a bombing at the Kabul airport that killed 13 U.S. service members and almost 200 Afghans.",
      "Blinken said many of the failures stemmed from the withdrawal deal that President Donald Trump signed with the Taliban in 2020 during his first term.",
      "\u201cTo the extent President Biden faced a choice, it was between ending the war or escalating,\u201d he said. \u201cHad he not followed through on his predecessor\u2019s commitment, attacks on our forces and allies would have resumed, and the Taliban\u2019s assault on the country\u2019s major cities would have commenced.\u201d",
      "Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, the committee chair, and other Republican lawmakers accused the Biden administration of failing to anticipate how quickly the U.S.-backed Afghan government would collapse and ignoring warnings about it from lower-ranking U.S. officials, which Blinken denied.",
      "\u201cThis catastrophic event was the beginning of a failed foreign policy that lit the world on fire,\u201d McCaul said.",
      "Also on Wednesday, Taliban refugee minister Khalil Haqqani was killed along with two others in a suicide bombing at the Ministry for Refugees and Repatriation in the Afghan capital, Kabul. He was the most high-profile casualty of a bombing in Afghanistan since the Taliban\u2019s return to power and the first cabinet member to killed.",
      "The Islamic State Khorasan Province, an affiliate of the Islamic State group, claimed responsibility for the attack.",
      "Brian Cheng reported from Hong Kong, Abigail Williams from Washington and Mushtaq Yusufzai from Peshawar, Pakistan."

      "Gukesh, who became at the age of 12 then the second-youngest grandmaster in history represents a new wave of Indian talent after Anand broke Russia\u2019s grip on the game with his title win in 2007. Gukesh has called Anand his \u201cinspiration and a role model.\u201d",
      "Thursday's decisive match came after a tense battle that left the two players tied going into the game's final classical match.",
      "The teenager left Ding gasping on Wednesday in Game 13, with Ding admitting in the post-match news conference he almost gave up but Ding survived the bashing and ended the game in a draw that tied the two players at 6.5 points.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fitting that the match goes to the last game, because we\u2019ve both showed a lot of fighting spirit and played some very entertaining chess,\u201d Gukesh said at a post-match news conference.",
      "But analysts said Ding made a crucial blunder in the deciding Game 14 that ultimately handed the teen the title.",
      "\u201cI probably got so emotional because I did not really expect to win that position,\u201d Gukesh told reporters, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "\u201cWe all know who Ding is \u2014 he has been one of the best players in history for several years. For me he is the real World Champion,\u201d Gukesh said.",
      "Indian prime Minister Narendra Modi praised the win as \u201chistoric and exemplary!\u201d",
      "Gukesh had \u201cnot only etched his name in the annals of chess history but has also inspired millions of young minds to dream big and pursue excellence,\u201d Modi said in a post on X.",
      "While the tournament is undoubtedly the game\u2019s marquee event, this year was different.",
      "Not only were the Russians absent from the final, a rarity given their decades-long dominance of the game, but also absent was one of the sport\u2019s most well-known figures, Magnus Carlsen of Norway.",
      "Carlsen, 34, gained the title of \u201cGOAT\u201d (a popular acronym for the \u201cgreatest of all time\u201d) as he reigned supreme in the sport starting in his teenage years but vacated his title in 2022, citing a lack of motivation. His last major showing, his 2021 defense against Russia\u2019s Ian Nepomniachtchi, drew record-breaking online audiences.",
      "While the absence of Carlsen, who is still one of the most marketable figures in chess, was felt in Singapore, Ding\u2019s recent struggles also cast a shadow over the finale.",
      "The Chinese move-calculating machine won the crown last year, defeating Nepomniachtchi. His victory was also a proud moment for China, affirming its status as a chess superpower."

      "\u201cThat is true, yes, and this is an example of President Trump creating an open dialogue with leaders of countries that are not just allies but our adversaries and our competitors, too,\" she said.",
      "Leavitt added, \"We saw this in his first term. He got a lot of criticism for it, but it led to peace around this world. He is willing to talk to anyone, and he will always put America\u2019s interests first.\"",
      "Asked if Xi had responded to the invitation, Leavitt said, \"To be determined,\" adding that it is \"precedent\" to invite foreign dignitaries to the inauguration.",
      "It would be unprecedented, however, if Xi actually attends. China's U.S. embassy didn't immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment.",
      "The president-elect has said he has a strong relationship with Xi and that the Chinese leader respects him. The U.S.-China relationship, on the other hand, could change during a second Trump administration as the president-elect has advocated a tougher approach toward the country than that instituted by the Biden administration.",

      "Trump had supported the ban before\u00a0reversing his position\u00a0earlier this year.",
      "Trump has long touted his close relationship with Xi, whom he hosted at Mar-a-Lago in 2017.\u00a0Xi congratulated Trump after his election victory last month, but it is not clear whether the two men have spoken.",

      "The 11-year-old's boat had originally departed from Sfax, a port city on Tunisia's central coast, before hitting the days-long storm that prevented many rescue boats from setting sail.",
      "The girl, who is from Sierra Leone, told rescuers that she had last been in contact with two other people in the water two days earlier but had not seen them since.",

The announcement comes a week after the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a case involving state bans on puberty-suppressing medication and other forms of transition-related care for minors.",
      "Puberty blockers are commonly prescribed to transgender children in countries throughout the Western world to delay the onset of puberty or pause it as it is transpiring.

Puberty resumes when the medication is no longer taken.",

      "\u201cChildren\u2019s healthcare must always be evidence-led,\u201d British Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting said in a press release. \u201cThe independent expert Commission on Human Medicines found that the current prescribing and care pathway for gender dysphoria and incongruence presents an unacceptable safety risk for children and young people.\u201d",
      "Dr. Hilary Cass, the author of the independent study, known as the \u201cCass report,\u201d said she supported the ban, according to the same release.",

      "\u201cChanging climatic and ocean conditions could be driving these migrations to new breeding grounds.
