      "Bad Bunny captivated audiences with his residency in Puerto Rico, inspiring patriotism and drawing half a million people to the island this summer",
      "NEW YORK -- Crowds wore maga flowers and \u201cpavas\u201d \u2014 straw hats traditionally worn by j\u00edbaros, Puerto Rican rural farmers. They drank Medalla beer and danced salsa.",
      "Over the course of a 31-date residency at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico in San Juan, Bad Bunny worked a miracle, inspiring patriotism in the hearts of a proud Boricua people, and in those traveling to Puerto Rico for the first time. He performed on two stages, one showcasing the island's natural beauty with its flamboyan and plantain trees, and another, a casita (\u201clittle house\u201d), for the pari de marquesina, a house party.",
      "If all the world's a stage \u2014 might as well make it home.",
      "In February, it can be expected that the artist born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio will bring the same spirit to the 2026 Super Bowl. And he'll do so in Spanish \u2014 a landmark moment for Latino culture.",
      "Bad Bunny's \u201cNo Me Quiero Ir De Aqu\u00ed\u201d residency (in English, \u201cI Don\u2019t Want to Leave Here\u201d) bypassed a traditional U.S. tour, bringing approximately half a million people to the island during the slow summer tourism season and generating an estimated $733 million for Puerto Rico. Across three hours, attendees were guided through a musical history \u2014 reggaet\u00f3n hits from Bad Bunny's singular discography as well as the folkloric styles of his latest album, \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos.\u201d (\u201cI Should Have Taken More Photos.\")",
      "There was a political history, too: like in the affecting song \u201cLo Que Pas\u00f3 a Hawaii,\u201d (\u201cWhat Happened to Hawaii\u201d), a rallying cry for Puerto Rico's autonomy. Or 2022's \u201cEl Apag\u00f3n\u201d (\u201cThe Blackout\u201d), in reference to Hurricane Maria, its aftermath and the continued anger and frustration over persistent, chronic power outages.",
      "Of course, a Super Bowl halftime show traditionally runs 12 to 15 minutes. It's not a lot of time to bring Puerto Rico, or its complicated colonial history, to the NFL's mainstream \u2014 but it is enough for a taste.",
      "It's worth mentioning Benito has done so before: making a surprise appearance at the Super Bowl in 2020, during Shakira and Jennifer Lopez's performance. He sang in Spanish alongside two artists whose bilingual hits helped usher in a crossover era for Latin music in the \u201800s. He\u2019s a direct inheritor of their successes, and he's been able to kick the door down further \u2014 helping to establish an industry where Latino superstars need not record their music in English to have a career.",
      "Bad Bunny is simultaneously an interesting and an obvious choice for the NFL: One of the most popular artists on the planet who understands that going global means embracing the local, performing during the most-watched television program of the year.",
      "In a recent interview with i-D Magazine, Bad Bunny mentioned that one of the reasons his residency bypassed the continental U.S. were concerns around the mass deportations of Latinos.",
      "\u201cThere was the issue of \u2014 like, (expletive) ICE could be outside (my concert). And it\u2019s something that we were talking about and very concerned about,\u201d he told the publication, referencing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ( Hundreds of people have been detained in Puerto Rico since large-scale arrests began in late January, surprising many in the U.S. territory that has long welcomed migrants.) It resonated with Latinos and the Spanish speaking community, who have grown increasingly weary amid growing anti-immigrant sentiment and raids, as President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies and executive actions have vastly expanded who is eligible for deportation.",
      "Bad Bunny has long been critical of Trump and backed Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. \u201cI will never forget what Donald Trump did and what he did not do when Puerto Rico needed a caring and a competent leader,\u201d he said in a video last year.",
      "For some Trump supporters, Bad Bunny's booking at the 2026 Super Bowl is a divisive political pick. Conservative commentator Benny Johnson described Bad Bunny as an \u201canti-ICE activist\" on Instagram.",

      "At the very least, Bad Bunny, who performs in Spanish and will do so at the Super Bowl, is set to make history, further proving that connecting with a U.S. and international audience does not require singing in English.",
      "The question is \u2014 what messages will Bad Bunny deliver in a culture where identity is politicized? And what does it mean that his performance arrives in the midst of one of the largest immigration crackdowns in U.S. history, where Latinos are especially vulnerable?",
      "In February, Kendrick Lamar's 2025 Super Bowl halftime performance made art of his short set, offering a meta commentary on race and America. \u201cThe revolution \u2019bout to be televised,\u201d he announced early in the performance.",
      "It featured actor Samuel L. Jackson as Uncle Sam, whose character critiqued the rapper and his dancers dressed in red, white and blue for being \u201ctoo loud, too reckless, too ghetto,\u201d reminding them to \u201cplay the game.\u201d There was the sense that Lamar was breaking the fourth wall, reminding viewers of the NFL's political associations following Colin Kaepernick\u2019s kneeling protests and the Black Lives Matter movement.",
      "That Lamar was able to weave American themes into his history-making performance as the first solo hip-hop artist to ever headline the coveted slot will no doubt benefit Bad Bunny. At the very least, he may learn from the rapper's layered and conceptual narratives, that messages on the NFL stage do not need to be explicit to be effective.",
      "At every date of his residency, Bad Bunny invited celebrities \u2014 among them LeBron James, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 \u2014 to join in his party. He also performed with many musicians, including Puerto Rico heavyweights Jowell y Randy, Arc\u00e1ngel and notably Marc Anthony. The pair duetted \u201cPreciosa,\u201d which is viewed as one of Puerto Rico\u2019s unofficial anthems.",
      "Written by Puerto Rican composer Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez Mar\u00edn in 1937, \u201cPreciosa\u201d references Puerto Rico\u2019s hybrid identity \u2014 a mix of Spanish, African and the indigenous Taino cultures \u2014 and threats made to the island in its long colonial history. (\u201cNo importa el tirano te trate con negra maldad,\u201d goes the chorus. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter that the tyrant treats you with black hatred.\u201d) It also arrived shortly after the 1937 Ponce massacre, in which a peaceful march organized by the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party ended in a police shooting where 19 died and 200 were injured.",
      "It's common for Super Bowl halftime performances to bring surprise guests into their sets \u2014 and no doubt Bad Bunny will do the same \u2014 but who he chooses will wait to be seen. If he pulls from the book of Lamar, any collaboration may have veiled political weight \u2014 informed by his residency, but softened for the NFL crowd.",

      "They filed their sentencing recommendation shortly after midnight, including letters from some of his accusers describing how his violence and demands had impacted their lives.",

      "In July, Combs was convicted of two charges for violating the Mann Act, which outlaws interstate commerce related to prostitution, for arranging the paid sexual encounters between his girlfriends and male sex workers. Each count carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.",
      "The same jury acquitted the Bad Boy Records founder of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges that could have resulted in a life sentence.",

      "New rules that limit the access of journalists in the Pentagon and appear to condition entry into the building on agreement to restrictions have led to a standoff between the press and the Trump administration's defense department",
      "Journalists who cover the Pentagon and the Trump admnistration are in a standoff about new rules that limit the access of the media to most areas within the Pentagon and appear to condition overall entry to the building on an agreement to restrictions in reporting.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's team characterizes the changes as an effort to protect national security and the safety of those who work at the Pentagon, while many in the press see it as an effort to exert control and avoid embarrassing stories.",
      "Journalists who want to hold on to badges that permit access to the Pentagon were told on Sept. 19 they must sign a letter acknowledging the new rules by this Tuesday or the badge \u201cwill be revoked.\u201d The new policy says that Defense Department information \u201cmust be approved for public release by an appropriate authorizing official before it is released, even if unclassified.\u201d Classified material faces even tighter restrictions.",
      "That level of control immediately alarmed journalists and their advocates.",
      "\u201cAsking independent journalists to submit to these kinds of restrictions is at stark odds with the constitutional protections of a free press in a democracy, and a continued attempt to throttle the public's right to understand what their government is doing,\u201d said Charles Stadtlander, spokesman for The New York Times.",
      "In a subsequent letter to the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, Hegseth aide Sean Parnell suggested that journalists misunderstood some of the new rules. He said, for example, that the restriction against releasing unclassified information is the policy that Pentagon officials must follow \u2014 not something the journalists must abide by.",
      "\u201cIt should come as no surprise that the mainstream media is once again misrepresenting the Pentagon's press procedures,\u201d Parnell said in a post on X. \u201cLet's be absolutely clear: Journalists are not required to clear their stories with us. That claim is a lie.\u201d",
      "However, the new policy says that journalists who encourage Pentagon officials to break the rules \u2014 in other words, ask sources for information \u2014 could be subject to losing their building access.",
      "While it appeared that Parnell sought to soften some of the hard edges of his policy in response to questions raised by the reporters' committee, there's still enough confusion to merit a meeting to clear things up, said Grayson Clary, a lawyer for RCFP. There's some wariness among news organizations about what they would be agreeing to if they sign the letter, and it's not clear how many people \u2014 if any \u2014 have done so.",
      "The new rules continue a tense relationship between the press and the Hegseth team, which had already evicted some news outlets from their regular workspaces in favor of friendlier outlets and limited the ability of reporters to roam around the Pentagon. Hegseth and Parnell seldom hold press briefings.",
      "Parnell did not respond to a request for comment by The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cIt's control, just 100% control,\u201d said Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine. Goldberg, who is not stationed at the Pentagon, wrote the most embarrassing story of Hegseth's tenure so far when he was inadvertently included in a Signal group chat where Hegseth and other national officials discussed an imminent attack on Houthis in Yemen. The brouhaha became widely known as \u201cSignalgate.\u201d",
      "Pentagon leadership was also reportedly unhappy over a story that said Elon Musk was to get a briefing on military strategy for China, leading President Donald Trump to stop it, and other stories about initial assessments of damage in the military strike against Iran.",
      "No American reporter accredited to the Pentagon that he knows is interested in subverting national security or putting anyone in the military in harm's way, Goldberg said.",
      "In his own case, Goldberg did not report on what he learned until after the attack was over. He said he contacted officials in the group chat to ask if there was anything he learned that was harmful to the country in any way. He did not include in his story the name of a CIA official mentioned in the messages who was technically still undercover, he said.",
      "\u201cThe only people in Signalgate who were putting American troops in harm's way were the national leadership of the United States by discussing on a commercial messaging app the launch times of strikes on a hostile country,\u201d he said.",

With the exception of a few areas, reporters are not permitted under the new rules to walk through the Pentagon without an official escort.",
      "Priest said the corridors of the Pentagon were like areas around Congress where reporters buttonhole politicians. Priest recalled staking out military officials waiting for them to come out of a bathroom.",
      "\u201cThey know the goal of the media is to get around the official gobbledygook and get out the truth,\u201d Priest said. \u201cThey may not help you. But some of them want to help Americans know what is going on.\u201d",

They've known that for decades.\u201d",
      "Reporters who don\u2019t follow the new rules won\u2019t necessarily be expelled immediately, Parnell told the reporter\u2019s committee. But access will be determined by Hegseth\u2019s team.",
      "While reporters already stationed in the Pentagon were given until Sept. 30 to sign, they were allowed to request an additional five days for legal review.",
      "Although the Times, Washington Post and Atlantic all put out statements against the Pentagon's plan, none of the publications would say what they have recommended that their reporters do \u2014 perhaps an indication that they consider negotiations potentially fruitful.",
      "President Donald Trump hasn't hesitated to fight the media when he thinks he's been wronged, launching lawsuits against CBS News, ABC News, The Wall Street Journal and the Times. Yet he's also frequently accessible to the press, more so than many of his predecessors, and there has been some uncertainty in the White House about the Pentagon's policy.",
      "When a reporter asked, \u201cshould the Pentagon be in charge of deciding what reporters can report on?\u201d the president replied, \u201cNo, I don't think so. Listen, nothing stops reporters. You know that.\u201d",
      "Goldberg noted that it's more than just an issue for reporters. \u201cThe American people have a right to know what the world's most powerful military does in their name and with their money,\u201d he said. \u201cThat seems fairly obvious to me.\u201d",

It also raises fresh questions about how much space there will be for his trademark symbolism and social commentary \u2014 including his past criticism of President Donald Trump \u2014 given the NFL's history of keeping performances tightly managed.",
      "Here are some things to know about the selection.",
      "The halftime show is a collaboration between the NFL, Roc Nation and Apple Music.",
      "Roc Nation, Jay-Z\u2019s entertainment company, has curated performers since 2019 and returns alongside veteran producer Jesse Collins. Apple Music distributes the performance, while the NFL ultimately controls the stage, broadcast and branding.",
      "Artists don\u2019t get a paycheck for performing. However, their payoff is global exposure. That imbalance gives the league leverage, though history shows that high-powered stars sometimes defy the league\u2019s guardrails.",
      "The NFL has a track record of pushing back when artists get political. However, some performers don't always comply.",
      "\u2022 In 2020, the league asked Jennifer Lopez to cut a segment featuring children in cages, a critique of U.S. immigration policies. She refused.",
      "\u2022 In 2022, it was reported that Dr. Dre and Eminem were both advised not to kneel or reference police, but they went forward.",
      "\u2022 Rapper M.I.A. flashed a middle finger during Madonna\u2019s set, earning a hefty fine in 2012. She and the NFL ultimately reached a settlement ending their multimillion dollar dispute a couple years later.",
      "While Bad Bunny is a known hitmaker, he\u2019s also an artist who ties his music to Puerto Rican identity, colonial politics and immigrant struggles. His Super Bowl announcement included a pointed dedication: \u201cThis is for my people, my culture, and our history.\u201d",
      "That alone sets the stage for a performance that could carry layered meanings far beyond spectacle.",
      "In his career, Bad Bunny has become one of the world\u2019s most streamed artists with albums such as \u201cUn Verano Sin Ti,\u201d an all-Spanish-language record.",
      "The 31-year-old artist born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio has won three Grammys and 12 Latin Grammys. He has become a global ambassador for Latin music, starred in films such as \u201cBullet Train,\u201d \u201cCaught Stealing\u201d and \u201cHappy Gilmore 2,\u201d and collaborated with top fashion houses. He enters November's Latin Grammys as the leading nominee with 12, dethroning producer and songwriter \u00c9dgar Barrera.",
      "Bad Bunny has been vocal in his opposition to Trump and his policies. In the final weeks of the 2024 campaign, he backed former Vice President Kamala Harris after a comedian at Trump\u2019s Madison Square Garden rally mocked Puerto Rico as a \u201cfloating island of garbage.\u201d",
      "Days later, Bad Bunny posted a video showcasing Puerto Rico\u2019s beaches and artists, captioned simply: \u201cgarbage.\u201d",
      "Since Trump took office, Bad Bunny's criticism hasn\u2019t slowed. This year, he shared an Instagram video appearing to show immigration agents making arrests in Puerto Rico, with the voice behind the camera cursing the agents.",

      "The halftime announcement has already drawn split responses. California Gov. Gavin Newsom cheered the booking, writing on X: \u201cCalifornia is excited to welcome you to Super Bowl LX.\u201d",

      "Bad Bunny has long shrugged off such critiques. Asked by The New York Times earlier this year how he felt about fans who don\u2019t understand his lyrics, he sang into the microphone: \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d",
      "Trump has a long history of inserting politics into sports. He\u2019s pushed for the late Pete Rose\u2019s Hall of Fame induction, threatened to block Washington\u2019s new stadium deal if the team didn\u2019t restore its old name, and frequently used sporting events as political platforms.",
      "The moves are part of his broader efforts to shape the country\u2019s cultural mood, weighing in on entertainers and companies alike. He blasted late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, whose show briefly faced suspension after the Trump administration signaled potential repercussions following remarks in the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk\u2019s assassination.",
      "He also revived his long-running feud with Rosie O\u2019Donnell, saying earlier this year that he was considering \u201ctaking away\u201d her U.S. citizenship after she criticized his proposed spending cuts.",
      "And just last month, Trump inserted himself into the backlash over Cracker Barrel\u2019s new logo, posting on Truth Social that the company should stick with its old design. When the chain reversed course, he celebrated the decision as a personal victory.",
      "For Bad Bunny, the halftime show is the ultimate stage to showcase his music, heritage and global influence. For the NFL and Apple Music, it\u2019s a balancing act: deliver a spectacle that celebrates diversity without igniting controversy that scares off advertisers.",
      "If Bad Bunny leans strictly into spectacle, the moment could be historic for Latin music. If he threads in political symbolism, it could become one of the most dissected halftime performances in Super Bowl history.",

      "\u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s widely acclaimed American epic of rebellion and resistance, opened with $22.4 million in ticket sales from North American theaters over the weekend",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s widely acclaimed American epic of rebellion and resistance, opened with $22.4 million in ticket sales from North American theaters over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "Anderson\u2019s ultracontemporary opus signifies a major gamble by Warner Bros. With \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d the studio is making a $130 million-plus bet that audiences would come out for 170-minute-long powerhouse drama from one of cinema\u2019s most celebrated auteurs the way they usually only turn up for a franchise or superhero movie.",
      "Anderson, many critics said, delivered the movie of year. \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Teyana Taylor and Sean Penn, has been hailed as a film brimming with many of the political conflicts of today. Oscar prognosticators have pegged it this year\u2019s best-picture front-runner. Aided by DiCaprio\u2019s drawing power, the film added $26.1 million overseas.",
      "But good reviews, star power and a marquee filmmaker are nowadays often insufficient to make a hit. For a movie that cost at least $130 million to make, plus many millions more to market, \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d will have a long road to reach profitability. For most releases with such a high budget, a $22.4 million start would be a disappointment.",
      "Executives for Warner Bros. declined to be interviewed about the opening.",
      "Yet \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d like movies from earlier movie eras, will hope its time in theaters is more about the long run than opening weekend. Warners is hoping word-of-mouth, awards conversation and a rolling awareness that \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d is a major movie event, will keep ticket sales strong in the weeks, or even months, to come.",
      "Some signs suggest that\u2019s possible. Audiences gave \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d an \u201cA\u201d CinemaScore. That\u2019s far better than CinemaScores for previous Anderson wide releases, including 1997\u2019s \u201cBoogie Nights\u201d (\u201cC\u201d), 1999\u2019s \u201cMagnolia\u201d (\u201cC-\u201d) and 2002\u2019s \u201cPunch-Drunk Love\u201d (\u201cD+).",
      "\u201cThe long-term playability is going to be key for this,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cAnd given the outpouring of support by critics and audiences, alike, that's where it's going to make back its budget.\u201d",
      "Yet as highly regarded as Anderson is, his films have rarely made a big impact at the box office. His biggest hit was 2007\u2019s \u201cThere Will Be Blood,\u201d which collected $76.4 million worldwide.",
      "For Warner Bros., \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d marked its ninth movie this year to open No. 1, more than any other studio. That success \u2014 with $4 billion in global sales \u2014 has included some refreshingly original films that haven\u2019t always made their most obvious way into theaters.",
      "Warners released Ryan Coogler\u2019s \u201cSinners\u201d in April, and it went on to gross $366.7 million worldwide. \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d chose to opt out of the usual fall festival platforms for prestige films, and first screened while most critics were in Venice or Toronto. Yet \u201cSinners\u201d and \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d will likely be favorites for many of the same prizes in the coming awards season.",
      "Anderson\u2019s film, loosely inspired by Thomas Pynchon\u2019s \u201cVineland,\u201d stars DiCaprio as a former revolutionary living off the grid with his teenage daughter (Chase Infiniti). Shot in VistaVision, \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d played in several large-screen formats, including 70mm, IMAX, 70mm and, on four screens, in VistaVision.",
      "Second place went \u201cGabby\u2019s Dollhouse: The Movie.\u201d The Universal Pictures release, produced by DreamWorks Animation, grossed $13.5 million in 3,500 theaters. It\u2019s a good start for the G-rated film, based on the long-running series. \u201cGabby\u2019s Dollhouse: The Movie,\u201d which cost $32 million to make, also earned an \u201cA+\u201d CinemaScore from audiences.",

      "NEW DELHI -- The death toll following a stampede at a political rally for a popular Indian actor and politician in the southern state of Tamil Nadu has climbed to 40, the state\u2019s health minister said Sunday, as medics treated at least 124 injured in hospitals.",
      "Ma Subramanian told The Associated Press that 36 victims were dead by the time they were taken to a hospital on Saturday night and four more died later. He said the injured were largely stable. The dead included nine children, Subramanian said.",
      "Tens of thousands of people gathered in the district of Karur on Saturday to attend the rally by Joseph Vijay Chandrasekhar, popularly and professionally known as Vijay, amid sweltering heat.

      "In southern Indian states, particularly Tamil Nadu, some film stars have larger than life status, rooted in the ancient Tamil culture of hero worship. Many have become successful politicians and some have even been given divine status.",

      "R. Rajendaran, a lawyer in Karur who witnessed the rally and subsequent accident, said at one point Vijay threw water bottles into the crowd from atop his campaign vehicle.",
      "\u201cWhen he decided to leave and his vehicle started moving, commotion broke out as hundreds of his fans and supporters chased his vehicle,\u201d Rajendaran said. \u201cThat is what led to the stampede.\u201d",

      "A new poll finds that younger adults are more likely to use subtitles while watching TV or movies than are older adults",
      "NEW YORK -- Taylor Heine, 35, is often multitasking when she watches TV shows or movies at home. \u201cI\u2019ll be playing on the phone, loving on my animals, maybe cleaning, picking up,\u201d she says.",
      "So she watches with the subtitles turned on.",
      "\u201cThat way I can kind of switch back and forth, be able to listen to it or look back at the screen and I know what\u2019s going on, Heine says.\u201d She can also catch up if she misses a piece of dialogue.",
      "It benefits her fianc\u00e9, too.",
      "\"When he\u2019s cooking or banging around in the kitchen, that way I don\u2019t have to blare the TV,\" she says.",
      "Closed captions or subtitles can be an acquired taste. Some people find them distracting, and even family members in the same household can be in disagreement, resulting in tussles for the remote. But Heine, who lives in Johnson City, Tennessee, is in good company, according to a new survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research: People under age 45 are more likely to use them than older adults.",
      "The poll finds that about 4 in 10 adults under 45 use subtitles at least \u201coften\u201d when watching TV or movies, compared with about 3 in 10 adults older than 45. Those 60 and older are especially likely to say they \u201cnever\u201d use subtitles.",
      "The poll suggests many young adults use subtitles because they are watching in noisy environments, whereas older adults choose them to better hear or understand what is being said.",
      "That makes sense to David Barber, a sound editor and mixer and president of the Motion Picture Sound Editors.",
      "\u201cPart of it is cultural,\u201d Barber says. \u201cWhat the younger kids are doing is, a lot of them will multitask. They\u2019ll listen to music while they\u2019re watching a show. So they\u2019re catching bits and pieces of this, bits and pieces of that. I think they probably are half-listening and half-watching. It\u2019s an interesting phenomenon.\u201d",
      "Many people, regardless of age, use closed captions simply to better catch dialogue.",
      "Most subtitle-users, 55%, say they use closed captions because they want to catch every word. About 4 in 10 say they do so because of difficulty understanding accents or because they are watching a foreign movie or show.",
      "Ariaunna Davis, 21, says she typically uses subtitles if she is in an environment where she cannot hear the audio and does not want to blast the volume, or if she cannot understand a character\u2019s accent.",
      "\u201cIf I want to know most of the words that are being said and the audio\u2019s a bit iffy, then that\u2019s the moment I\u2019ll mostly use captions,\u201d she says.",
      "Adrian Alaniz, 31, of Midland, Texas, thinks his hearing was slightly damaged by the concerts he attended when he was younger. With subtitles, he can be sure he is understanding what is going on, particularly if he is eating something crunchy like a bag of chips.",
      "In the animated shows Alaniz watches, the subtitles are particularly helpful for translation. There have been times, he says, when dubbed audio and subtitles do not match. \u201cSometimes the audio doesn\u2019t come across as clearly and the subtitles do help in that matter,\u201d he says.",
      "The poll found that about 3 in 10 U.S. adults use subtitles because they are watching in a noisy environment, while roughly one-quarter say they do so because of poor audio quality.",

He also notes that speakers are often on the back of a flat-screen TV and project toward the wall. \u201cSo you\u2019re not listening on a stellar sound system to start with,\u201d he says.",
      "Another factor is performance-based.",
      "Actors have \u201ca more internal and close\u201d style of emoting than they did decades ago, says sound designer Karol Urban, and sometimes that makes it difficult to discern dialogue.",
      "And there is now simply a lot more sound competing with dialogue, Urban says. \u201cBack in the day there were a lot less sound effects, less music swells,\u201d she notes. \u201cWhen you add more things under dialogue, you\u2019re adding more frequencies and things that can interfere with dialogue.\u201d",
      "Davis, of Tampa, Florida, points to the show \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d as one instance where she often turns on subtitles so she is not constantly adjusting the volume.",
      "\u201cA lot of times the speaking in that show is low and fits the dark environment if it\u2019s in a certain scene,\u201d she says. \u201cThen the next scene will be just music and it's blasting through the walls.\u201d",
      "About one-quarter of subtitle users say they turn on captions because they are watching while multitasking. Fewer say the reason is a hearing impairment, trying to learn a new language or watching with the sound off.",
      "Ask a younger or older adult, though, and you could get a very different justification.",
      "Young adults who have used subtitles are more likely than those 45 and older to say they do this because they are watching in a noisy environment or watching while multitasking. Older subtitle users \u2014 those 45 and older \u2014 are more likely than younger adults to say they use closed captions because they have difficulty understanding accents or because of a hearing impairment.",
      "About 3 in 10 adults 60 and older who use subtitles say they use closed captions because of a hearing impairment, compared with only 7% for younger adults.",
      "Patricia Gill, 67, of Columbus, Tennessee, does not use closed captions. But when her grandson comes over, Gill often notices he has subtitles on his phone when watching movies.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a typical almost-teenager, he just likes watching his phone,\u201d she says.",

      "On the \u201cNeon Grey Midnight Green\u201d album, Case was intent on inviting a large number of musicians to join her, and their power is evident. She employs a 16-piece orchestra. Add in 10 other listed players (including herself) and that makes for 26 musicians on the album-ending song \u201cMatch-Lit\u201d alone.",
      "\u201cI wanted to remind people of what it sounded like to have a large group of people playing together,\u201d Case said. \u201cThat doesn't mean I have anything against synthesizer string sections or horn sections, because those things sound cool when you use them in the right way. And having a whole orchestra is cost prohibitive, especially now. I really wanted to do it because I didn't think I'd have the chance to do it again.\u201d",
      "Maybe it\u2019s not a wall of sound, but the swirling strings on \u201cWreck,\u201d for example, take her music to a joyful place. Listen carefully for the harp.",
      "It wasn't writer's block that kept Case out of the picture for a few years. The pandemic was an interruption for everybody. The Vermont-based singer also records and tours with the band The New Pornographers. She has written the music for an upcoming stage adaptation of \u201cThelma & Louise.\u201d And she also wrote a memoir, \u201cThe Harder I Fight the More I Love You,\u201d published earlier this year.",
      "The book describes a harrowing upbringing, mostly in the Pacific Northwest by parents who conceived her as teenagers and were unprepared and uninterested in raising her. Case says at one point, she was told her mother had died, only to have her show up again a year and a half later with no explanation.",
      "Case was essentially on her own by the time she was a teenager. Music, to a great extent, saved her.",
      "The on-again, off-again relationship with her mother is off. \u201cI don't even know anything about my mother anymore,\u201d Case said.",

      "What will be interesting in coming months, as she prepares to take new songs on the road, is whether opening her life to the world with the memoir will draw more people to her music. Her management has seen preliminary signs that it has, but Case isn't sure.",
      "Colin Dickerman, editor-in-chief at Grand Central Publishing and editor of Case's book, has a hunch that it will. From reading reviews of the memoir, he knows it attracted fans who wanted to learn more about the writer of songs they loved. But it also reached people who were interested in the story about overcoming adversity and subsequently said they would check out her music.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Paul Thomas Anderson spent about 20 years writing \u201cOne Battle After Another.\u201d After two decades, it\u2019s never felt more relevant.",
      "The epic action thriller, inspired by Thomas Pynchon\u2019s \u201cVineland,\u201d hits theaters Friday. With a running time of 2 hours and 50 minutes, \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d wastes no time immersing audiences in its politically charged world.",
      "The revolution will not be televised, but it will be placed at the front and center of Anderson\u2019s film. The director isn\u2019t there to make his audience comfortable, star Teyana Taylor says, as he zeros in on themes of immigration, racism and systemic corruption showcased at their most absurd.",
      "\u201cI feel like PTA calls out a lot of things that are trying to get swept under the rug,\u201d Taylor told The Associated Press, referring to the director by his nickname. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I respect. This is really waking, shaking and baking some s---. Like, you gotta shake the table.\u201d",
      "Taylor\u2019s character, Perfidia Beverly Hills, is a member of the Weather Underground-inspired French 75 revolutionary group. From the film\u2019s first scene, we see the French 75 take matters into their own hands, liberating undocumented detainees, destroying corrupt political offices and launching their own form of justice, one right after the other. The group is peppered with members portrayed by musicians-turned-actors like Dijon Duenas, Alana Haim, and Shayna McHayle and notable actors like Regina Hall and Wood Harris.",
      "\u201cI mean, this movie is based on some of the revolutionaries and anarchists of the late '60s, the Weathermen that were fighting for civil rights, environmentalism too at the time, capitalism, Vietnam,\u201d star Leonardo DiCaprio told the AP. \u201cBut it\u2019s about the implosion of that too, about the extremes that people go to for their own ideology.\u201d",
      "DiCaprio portrays Bob Ferguson, known in the French 75\u2019s initial scenes as Ghetto Pat, known for his knowledge of explosives and undying devotion to both Perfidia and the revolution. Together, Perfidia and Pat seem unstoppable, until the racist and xenophobic Col. Steven Lockjaw (Sean Penn) sets out end the group to fuel his rise to power.",
      "\u201cAnd this is a movie, fast-forward, in today\u2019s day and age, where you see this sort of systematic breakdown that comes from it, if it\u2019s not done with grace and purity and consistently, the whole sort of\u2014 our revolution is dismantled and our past comes back to haunt us,\u201d said DiCaprio. \u201cSo that\u2019s what I love that Paul did. He shows extremity on both sides of the spectrum and how no one seems to be communicating or getting things done in the right way nowadays.\u201d",
      "The film jumps 16 years into the future. Perfidia has disappeared and DiCaprio\u2019s character lives under a new alias in a sanctuary city as a paranoid, stoner dad with his teenage daughter, Willa (newcomer Chase Infiniti). Everything is seemingly mundane until Lockjaw reappears, forcing the father-daughter duo on the run.",

      "Brett Goldstein explores complex relationships in the new film \u201cAll of You,\u201d streaming on Apple TV+ Friday",
      "Brett Goldstein might want to break your heart. Or at least give you a proper ugly cry.",
      "In the new film \u201cAll of You,\u201dstreaming on Apple TV+ Friday, audiences are presented with a sticky conundrum: What if your soulmate, and your best friend, were different people?",
      "Reactions might differ about the choices Simon (Goldstein) and Laura (Imogen Poots) make in the film, which is a kind of rom-com-dram, if you will. But one thing Goldstein has noticed is that a lot of people who see it think that it\u2019s about them.",
      "\u201cI think everyone has this friendship,\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cThere\u2019s someone in their life that is not their partner that they have a connection that feels more than friends, but what is that? What is love? And does it take away from the other? We just wanted to explore all of that over time.\u201d",
      "The idea came out of a getting to know you conversation with William Bridges, an Emmy winner for \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d whose episodes include \u201cUSS Callister.\" He co-wrote the film with Goldstein, and directed. At the time of the chat, Goldstein was single. Bridges was not. And Goldstein asked him if the woman he was seeing was \u201cthe one.\u201d It got them thinking about the idea of a soulmate test, something that could just take all the guesswork, all the bad dates, all the lost time, out of the equation.",
      "\u201cAll of You\u201d begins with a moment of truth as Simon accompanies Laura, his best friend from university, on her way to take the test. He even pays for it, and soon enough she\u2019s off making plans with a husband to be.",
      "Though the film has a bit of a science fiction element to it, it\u2019s decidedly less dystopian than a \u201cBlack Mirror.\u201d Some, like Laura, take the test. Some, like Simon, try to do it the old-fashioned way. But many are left wondering if they made the right choice. The film is told linearly, but skips over months and sometimes years in the saga of Laura and Simon.",

And I don\u2019t think you can vilify a person for sort of having them. It\u2019s just when they follow through it obviously complicates things.\u201d",
      "Part of the equation involved making sure that Laura\u2019s soulmate, and husband, wasn\u2019t easy to dismiss. Not only did they write him as kind, loving and a good father. They also cast a handsome Scottish actor, Steven Cree, to play him.",
      "\u201cOne thing we didn\u2019t want to do that I think romantic comedies do a lot is they make the other guy boring or a (expletive)-head. So you\u2019re going, \u2018Oh, obviously not him,\u2019\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cYou have to kind of stack the odds against all of them because that is more real and it\u2019s much more challenging, I think, for an audience because I think you are going \u2018I want this thing to happen and I also don\u2019t want this thing to happen.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d was a kind of unintentional touchstone in thinking about the idea of friendships between straight men and women that only became clear to them after they made the film. An even less intentional reference was \u201cAtonement.\u201d Unbeknownst to the filmmakers, they set a pivotal scene between Laura and Simon in the same cottage on the English Channel in East Sussex that Joe Wright used for his classic tearjerker.",
      "While movie fans might bemoan the lack of the Nora Ephron-style romantic comedies of the 1990s on our screens, modern movies are grappling with the state of relationships in serious, satirical and genre-skewing ways, with films like \u201cMaterialists,\u201d\u201cSplitsville,\u201d \u201cAll of You\u201d and more. The distinction, Bridges said, is perhaps audiences today are craving stories not about aspirational, unattainable romance, but about love \u2014 however complicated and messy it might be.",
      "\u201cWe have seen the movie where somebody runs to the train station at the end and confesses undying love and the movie ends and the idea is they live happily ever after. But I\u2019m not quite sure that that\u2019s the experience of love that a lot of people have,\u201d Bridges said. \u201cI think they\u2019re looking for love stories rather than romance stories.\u201d",

      "The Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services has brought hundreds of fraud cases in the last five years that are heavily reliant on transactional data with the goal of revoking people\u2019s federal food benefits",
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- A single mother who relied on federal food assistance lost her benefits in 2020 after Kentucky investigators concluded she\u2019d committed fraud.",
      "The state alleged she had made multiple same-day purchases, tried to overdraw her account a few times, entered a few invalid PINs and sometimes made \u201cwhole-dollar\u201d purchases that are unlikely during typical grocery runs.",
      "The woman from Salyersville in Appalachian Kentucky had an explanation: She worked at the store. She would sometimes buy lunch there and then get groceries after work. Her child would also occasionally use her card.",
      "An administrative hearing officer kicked her off the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) regardless, based solely on the allegedly suspicious shopping pattern. She sued \u2014 and won.",
      "\u201cIt is draconian to take away SNAP benefits from a single mother without clear and convincing evidence that intentional trafficking was occurring during a time when food scarcity is so prevalent,\u201d Franklin County Judge Thomas Wingate said in his 2023 decision.",
      "Over the last five years, the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services has brought hundreds of fraud cases that are heavily reliant on transactional data with the goal of revoking people\u2019s food benefits.",
      "Judges, lawyers and legal experts said in interviews and in court documents that such evidence proves little. Kentucky Public Radio reviewed dozens of administrative hearing decisions and court documents from the last five years in which the cabinet relied on shopping patterns to prove a person had \u201ctrafficked,\u201d or sold, their benefits.",
      "Kentucky is so aggressive in disqualifying people from SNAP benefits that the state is second in the nation for per-capita administrative disqualifications, behind Florida, according to the most recent federal data from 2023.",
      "In the last decade, disqualifications in Kentucky rose from fewer than 100 in 2015 to over 1,800 in 2023. And more than 300 others have been accused of selling or misusing their benefits since January 2024, according to records obtained by Kentucky Public Radio.",
      "Another Franklin County judge in 2023 ordered the cabinet to stop disqualifying individuals based solely on transactional data, but since the decision, at least three lawsuits allege the health agency continues to bring such cases.",
      "Transactional data alone cannot prove intent to commit fraud nor show the actual result of any individual transaction, University of Kentucky law professor Cory Dodds said, adding, \u201cI\u2019m not saying that folks didn\u2019t do it, didn\u2019t commit the fraud, but I don\u2019t think the cabinet in a lot of these cases has met their burden of proof, either.\u201d",
      "Kentuckians receive notice of their alleged suspicious activity through mailed letters, in which they\u2019re asked to voluntarily waive their right to a hearing and automatically accept the punishment. On first offense, that\u2019s generally a one-year SNAP ban. They\u2019re also required to repay the full amount the state says they misused.",
      "Often, these cases involve a relatively small amount of money. Records show that more than 900 people have been kicked off for \u201ctrafficking\u201d or misuse for less than $1,000 since 2022. The lowest amount alleged was 14 cents.",
      "The state has leaned heavily on administrative hearing waivers since 2015, and by 2023, almost a quarter of all disqualifications were via waiver. Some lawsuits allege individuals did not fully understand the consequences of the waivers and were encouraged to sign by officials.",
      "Kentucky Public Radio reviewed more than two dozen cases since 2020 in which the cabinet accused an individual of trafficking using only spending patterns, despite the participants\u2019 denial or lack of response \u2014 and with no other evidence or interviews presented, according to administrative hearing decisions.",
      "Kendra Steele, a spokesperson for the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, declined to schedule an interview with cabinet officials after multiple requests. Steele said in an email that \u201cwe have never\u201d brought trafficking cases based solely on transactional data and acknowledged it would not be sufficient to prove intent.",
      "In response to a different question, Steele wrote the investigation into fraud allegations consists of looking into income, living situations \u201cand patterns of spending that are indicative of trafficking.\u201d She did not indicate how any of those factors could be used to prove intentional misuse or selling of SNAP benefits, or how it differs from relying on transactional data \u2014 which is inherently a pattern of spending. Steele said in another email that they also interview vendors and SNAP recipients.",
      "Roughly 4 in 25 Kentuckians suffer from food insecurity, similar to the national rate of about 14%, according to an Associated Press analysis of U.S. Census Bureau and Feeding America data.",
      "The USDA will stop collecting and releasing statistics on food insecurity after October, saying Sept. 20 that the numbers had become \u201coverly politicized.\u201d The decision comes in the wake of federal funding cuts for food and nutrition safety net programs nationwide.",
      "In the last fiscal year, 1 in 8 Kentuckians benefitted from SNAP, formerly called food stamps. Food insecurity in Kentucky\u2019s rural areas is even more stark, and legal representation harder to come by.",
      "\u201cThe people who benefit from these programs are some of the folks that we need to be helping the most in this country,\u201d Dodds said. \u201cIt\u2019s our fellow Kentuckians who are going hungry as a result of baseless allegations of waste, fraud and abuse.\u201d",

But administrative hearing decisions reviewed by KPR from 2020 through 2023 included evidence the cabinet relied on; hearing officers would frequently say a person had trafficked their benefits based on shopping patterns the state deemed suspicious.",
      "National legal experts who specialize in SNAP access say an overreliance on transactional data isn\u2019t unique to Kentucky. Transactional data was initially meant as a tool to identify potential fraud cases \u2014 not as a means to prove it, Georgetown law professor David Super said.",
      "He\u2019s studied SNAP disqualifications for decades, and has seen many cases where he believes transactional data is misconstrued as direct evidence of wrongdoing, instead of requiring a state to build cases with witnesses, affidavits, video evidence and plea deals.",
      "In one redacted 2023 state administrative hearing decision, a hearing officer decided a woman in the eastern Kentucky city of McKee had trafficked her benefits because she had made eight back-to-back transactions in a year. The decision also said she\u2019d checked her balance several times, made a few insufficient fund attempts and had incorrectly entered her PIN number a few times.",
      "She lost her SNAP benefits for a year. In an appeal, the woman told the state she has two kids and had recently discovered she was pregnant.",
      "\u201cEveryone forgets to get something and has to go back in the store and get it,\u201d she wrote, defending her back-to-back purchases.",
      "She received another hearing, but the outcome didn\u2019t change.",
      "Cabinet officials acknowledged in cross examinations during a 2023 case that back-to-back transactions and whole-dollar purchases aren\u2019t forbidden under SNAP rules, nor are recipients told that the cabinet considers them suspicious.",
      "But all of these things are used as evidence \u2014 sometimes the sole evidence \u2014 that a person misused their benefits.",
      "Kristie Goff, an AppalRed legal aid lawyer in Prestonsburg in southeast Kentucky, used to see many of these cases, though they\u2019ve declined in the last year.",
      "\u201cThere have been very few instances in cases I have handled, where a client was not able to give me a perfectly reasonable explanation for those transactions, and none of it was trafficking,\u201d Goff said. \u201cThere are no receipts, there\u2019s no video footage to show that someone\u2019s doing anything wrong. It\u2019s just a number written on a paper.\u201d",
      "While saying purchasing history is insufficient to prove trafficking, Kentucky judges have stopped short of demanding that the state change how it trains employees or conducts its SNAP investigations.",
      "In response to an open records request, the cabinet provided KPR with documents used to train investigators on intentional program violations. They appear to almost exclusively discuss transactional data, including investigating back-to-back payments, large transactions and whole-dollar purchases.",
      "In 2020, Michigan appellate judges decided transactional data alone is never sufficient to prove that a business \u2014 or person \u2014 fraudulently used SNAP benefits.",
      "Dodds believes that should be the standard for all states, including Kentucky.",
      "He is in the early stages of systematically reviewing thousands of SNAP benefit trafficking hearing decisions between 2020 and 2023. Data from about 700 decisions in 2020 alone already shows that many Kentuckians have been denied benefits before the state presents what he considers real evidence of guilt.",
      "\u201cThere are maybe a handful of cases that I would say there was real evidence that they had done something wrong,\u201d Dodds said. \u201cThere was one where a woman was on the phone with the hearing officer while she was actively trying to sell her benefits. ...

      "A Seattle-area nonprofit group called Community Loaves donates home-baked bread and cookies to food banks in four states",
      "On a recent Saturday near Seattle, Cheryl Ewaldsen pulled three golden loaves of wheat bread out of her kitchen oven.",
      "The fragrant, oat-topped bread was destined not for her table, but for a local food bank, to be distributed to families increasingly struggling with hunger and the high cost of groceries.",
      "\u201cI just get really excited about it knowing that it\u2019s going to someone and they\u2019re going to make, like, 10 sandwiches,\u201d said Ewaldsen, 75, a retired university human resources director.",
      "Ewaldsen is a volunteer with Community Loaves, a Seattle-area nonprofit that started pairing home bakers with food pantries during the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 and hasn\u2019t stopped.",
      "Since 2020, the organization headed by Katherine Kehrli, the former dean of a culinary school, has donated more than 200,000 loaves of fresh bread and some 220,000 energy cookies to food banks. They come from a network of nearly 900 bakers in four states \u2014 Washington, Oregon, California and Idaho \u2014 and represent one of the largest such efforts in the country.",
      "Now, amid rising grocery prices and federal cuts to food aid for low-income people, demand for the group's donations of nutritious baked goods is greater than ever, Kehrli said.",
      "\u201cMost of our food banks do not get any kind of whole-grain sandwich bread donation,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we ask what we could do better, they just say, \u2018Bring us more.\u2019\u201d",
      "Ewaldsen\u2019s bread goes to the nearby Edmonds Food Bank, where the client list has swelled from 350 households to nearly 1,000 in the past three years, according to program manager Lester Almanza.",
      "Nationwide, more than 50 million people a year receive charitable food assistance, according to Feeding America, a hunger relief organization.",
      "Anti-hunger experts say they expect the need to rise as recent federal legislation sharply cutting food aid to poor people takes effect. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the tax and spending cuts bill Republicans muscled through Congress in July means 3 million people would not qualify for food stamps, also known as SNAP benefits.",
      "Gauging the impact, however, could soon be more difficult after the U.S. Agriculture Department recently said it would halt an annual report on hunger in America, saying it was redundant, costly and politicized \u201csubjective liberal fodder.\u201d After 30 years, the 2024 report, to be released on Oct. 22, will be the last, the agency said.",
      "\u201cEnding data collection will not end hunger, it will only make it a hidden crisis that is easier to ignore and more difficult to address,\u201d Crystal FitzSimons, president of the Food Research & Action Center, an advocacy group, said in a statement.",
      "Almanza said federal funding for his food bank has dropped at least 10% this year, meaning that every donation helps.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something that a lot of people rely on,\u201d he said.",
      "That includes people like Chris Redfearn, 42, and his wife, Melanie Rodriguez-Redfearn, 43, who turned to a food bank in Everett, Washington, last spring after moving to the area to find work. They had to stretch their savings until she began a new position this month teaching history at a local college. Chris Redfearn, who has worked for decades in business, is still looking.",
      "\u201cThe food pantry assists with anywhere from $40 to $80 worth of savings weekly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to keep ourselves afloat.\u201d",
      "Finding homemade bread from Community Loaves at a food pantry was a surprise, the couple said. Often, surplus bread sent by grocery stores includes highly processed white breads or sweets donated near their expiration or sell-by dates.",

      "The breads come in three varieties \u2014 honey oat, whole wheat and sunflower rye \u2014 all made with whole grains and minimally processed ingredients.",
      "\u201cThey make it really wholesome and fibrous,\u201d Chris Redfearn said. \u201cIt mimics most of the health-conscious breads that are out there.\u201d",
      "The notion of donating home-baked bread came to Kehrli, 61, during the pandemic, when she was displaced from her job at the busy Seattle Culinary Academy.",
      "\u201cI love to bake and just an idea sparked: Would it be possible for us to help from our home and get important valuable nutrition to our food banks?\u201d she recalled.",
      "Many food pantries don\u2019t accept or distribute donations of homemade baked goods. Feeding America warns individual bakers against the practice, saying \u201csince food banks can\u2019t confirm how your baked goods were made or their ingredients, they can\u2019t be donated.\"",
      "But health department rules vary by state, Kehrli learned. In Washington and the other three states where Community Loaves now operates, bread is one of the few foods allowed to be donated from a home kitchen through a program like theirs.",
      "\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be able to donate custard pies. We wouldn\u2019t be able to donate lasagna,\u201d Kehrli said. \u201cBut bread is deemed safe. Anything that is fully baked and does not require refrigeration.\u201d",
      "Still, Community Loaves bakers must follow approved recipes for the bread and two types of energy cookies. They obtain flour from common sources, and bake and deliver on a shared schedule twice a month.",
      "The bakers buy their own supplies, donating the cost of the ingredients as well as their time. Most make a few loaves per baking session before delivering them to local \u201chubs,\u201d where other volunteers collect the bread and transport it to the food banks.",
      "Bakers range from former professionals to beginners. A robust website with recipes and how-to videos backstops every step, Kehrli said.",
      "Baking the bread is satisfying on several levels, said Ewaldsen, who has donated nearly 800 loaves in less than two years. Part of it is addressing the physical need for food, but part is also addressing the spiritual hunger for connection with neighbors.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the opportunity for me to bake something and to share something with others in the community, where they don\u2019t necessarily need to know who I am, but they know that there\u2019s a community that loves and cares for them,\u201d she said.",
      "While such sentiments are sincere and admirable, anti-hunger experts stress that individual donations can't take the place of adequately funded government services for struggling Americans.",
      "\u201cIt's beautiful that our communities act this way,\u201d said Gina Plata-Nino of the Food Research & Action Center. \u201cBut it is a loaf of bread. That is going to feed one person \u2014 and there are millions in line.\"",

      "As mental health chatbots driven by artificial intelligence proliferate, a small number of states are trying to regulate them",
      "In the absence of stronger federal regulation, some states have begun regulating apps that offer AI \u201ctherapy\u201d as more people turn to artificial intelligence for mental health advice.",
      "But the laws, all passed this year, don't fully address the fast-changing landscape of AI software development. And app developers, policymakers and mental health advocates say the resulting patchwork of state laws isn't enough to protect users or hold the creators of harmful technology accountable.",
      "\u201cThe reality is millions of people are using these tools and they\u2019re not going back,\u201d said Karin Andrea Stephan, CEO and co-founder of the mental health chatbot app Earkick.",
      "___",

      "___",
      "The state laws take different approaches. Illinois and Nevada have banned the use of AI to treat mental health. Utah placed certain limits on therapy chatbots, including requiring them to protect users\u2019 health information and to clearly disclose that the chatbot isn\u2019t human. Pennsylvania, New Jersey and California are also considering ways to regulate AI therapy.",
      "The impact on users varies. Some apps have blocked access in states with bans. Others say they're making no changes as they wait for more legal clarity.",
      "And many of the laws don't cover generic chatbots like ChatGPT, which are not explicitly marketed for therapy but are used by an untold number of people for it. Those bots have attracted lawsuits in horrific instances where users lost their grip on reality or took their own lives after interacting with them.",
      "Vaile Wright, who oversees health care innovation at the American Psychological Association, agreed that the apps could fill a need, noting a nationwide shortage of mental health providers, high costs for care and uneven access for insured patients.",
      "Mental health chatbots that are rooted in science, created with expert input and monitored by humans could change the landscape, Wright said.",
      "\u201cThis could be something that helps people before they get to crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what\u2019s on the commercial market currently.\u201d",
      "That's why federal regulation and oversight is needed, she said.",
      "Earlier this month, the Federal Trade Commission announced it was opening inquiries into seven AI chatbot companies \u2014 including the parent companies of Instagram and Facebook, Google, ChatGPT, Grok (the chatbot on X), Character.AI and Snapchat \u2014 on how they \"measure, test and monitor potentially negative impacts of this technology on children and teens.\u201d And the Food and Drug Administration is convening an advisory committee Nov. 6 to review generative AI-enabled mental health devices.",
      "Federal agencies could consider restrictions on how chatbots are marketed, limit addictive practices, require disclosures to users that they are not medical providers, require companies to track and report suicidal thoughts, and offer legal protections for people who report bad practices by companies, Wright said.",
      "From \"companion apps\u201d to \u201cAI therapists\u201d to \u201cmental wellness\u201d apps, AI\u2019s use in mental health care is varied and hard to define, let alone write laws around.",
      "That has led to different regulatory approaches. Some states, for example, take aim at companion apps that are designed just for friendship, but don't wade into mental health care. The laws in Illinois and Nevada ban products that claim to provide mental health treatment outright, threatening fines up to $10,000 in Illinois and $15,000 in Nevada.",
      "But even a single app can be tough to categorize.",
      "Earkick's Stephan said there is still a lot that is \u201cvery muddy\u201d about Illinois' law, for example, and the company has not limited access there.",
      "Stephan and her team initially held off calling their chatbot, which looks like a cartoon panda, a therapist. But when users began using the word in reviews, they embraced the terminology so the app would show up in searches.",
      "Last week, they backed off using therapy and medical terms again. Earkick\u2019s website described its chatbot as \u201cYour empathetic AI counselor, equipped to support your mental health journey,\u201d but now it\u2019s a \u201cchatbot for self care.\u201d",

Directors of food pantries say the task of making sure people are fed is getting harder because of diminishing food supplies, increasing demand and an overwhelming reliance on volunteers, many of whom are retirees with ages up into their 80s.",
      "About one in seven people in rural Waldo County, where Neighbor\u2019s Cupboard is, were food insecure in 2023, a rate that was similar to the state and national average, according to an Associated Press analysis of U.S. Census Bureau and Feeding America data.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture will stop collecting and releasing statistics on food insecurity after October, saying on Sept. 20 that the numbers had become \u201coverly politicized.\u201d",
      "In March, the Trump administration cut more than $1 billion from two U.S. Department of Agriculture programs \u2014 the Emergency Food Assistance Program, which provides free food to food banks nationwide, and the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program, which provides funds to state, territorial and tribal governments to purchase food from local farmers for distribution to hunger relief organizations.",
      "\u201cI can watch the availability of federal food going down every month,\u201d Allen said.",
      "Charitable food networks are also bracing for $186 billion in cuts for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the federal low-income nutrition program better known as food stamps. In turn, Feeding America predicts that food pantries will see more demand.",
      "Complicating matters is the infrastructure through which the U.S. distributes most food to those who need help. In Maine, the nearly 600 hunger relief agencies that get free and low-cost food from Good Shepherd Food Bank rely on volunteers. This includes 250 food pantries as well as soup kitchens, senior centers, shelters, schools and youth programs.",
      "More than 75% of these organizations rely completely on volunteers, with no paid staff, according to Good Shepherd.",
      "Anna Korsen, who co-chairs the Ending Hunger in Maine advisory committee, said food pantries alone aren\u2019t the answer to food insecurity.",
      "\u201cIf our goal is to end hunger in Maine, which is a lofty goal, then we\u2019re not going to do that through a charitable food network that\u2019s run by volunteers, right?\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s supposed to be for crisis situations \u2026 but what has happened is that it is just a part of the food system now. It shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d",
      "Neighbor\u2019s Cupboard hummed with activity on a recent Wednesday morning, cans stacked in piles six feet high and children\u2019s collages taped to a cooler.",
      "Keith Ritchie was greeting clients \u2014 and keeping a gentle eye out to make sure no one took more than their fair share of limited foods. At 89, he is the pantry\u2019s oldest worker, although Betty Williams, 88, teases him about who\u2019s older.",
      "In more than 17 years of service, Ritchie said, \u201cI\u2019ve only missed twice.\u201d He drives 20 miles (32 kilometers) each way to dole out groceries and fill bags with \u201csurprises\u201d \u2013 donated items like Girl Scout cookies.",
      "\u201cYou see a lot of people you know,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know anybody\u2019s name, but I don\u2019t need a name. I just look at their faces.\u201d",
      "Younger volunteers can be harder to come by than affordable eggs. About 35% of Mainers volunteer \u2014 the third-highest rate in the nation, according to a 2024 report on the state of Maine\u2019s civic health. But just 20% of millennials volunteer in Maine, half the rate of Gen Xers and baby boomers, the same report said.",
      "It\u2019s not a lack of desire to serve, but obstacles in the way, said researcher Quixada Moore-Vissing, an author of the report.",
      "\u201cI would categorize it as being an overwhelmed and overworked society,\u201d Moore-Vissing said. \u201cThe rising costs of everything, and in particular the cost of housing, means that people have to work more.\"",

      "PORTLAND, Maine -- Australian scientists tested the strength of bite-resistant wetsuits by allowing sharks to chomp the materials at sea and found that the suits can help keep swimmers safe.",
      "Fatal shark bites are vanishingly rare, with less than 50 unprovoked shark bites on humans worldwide in 2024, according to the International Shark Attack File at the Florida Museum of Natural History. But increased sightings of large sharks in some parts of the world have swimmers, surfers and divers looking for new ways to stay safe.",

They performed the work by dragging samples of the materials behind boats and allowing white and tiger sharks to bite the samples.",
      "The bites from such large sharks can still cause internal and crushing injuries, but the materials showed effectiveness beyond a standard neoprene wetsuit, the scientists said. The research found that the bite-resistant materials \u201ccan reduce injuries sustained from shark encounters,\u201d said Flinders professor Charlie Huveneers, a member of the Southern Shark Ecology Group at Flinders and a study co-author.",
      "\"Bite-resistant material do not prevent shark bites, but can reduce injuries from shark bites and can be worn by surfers and divers,\" Huveneers said.",

      "President Donald Trump's administration has extended Georgia's Pathways to Coverage program for 15 months",
      "ATLANTA -- Georgia's program that provides health insurance to some low-income adults that document work or other activities has been extended for 15 months by President Donald Trump's administration.",
      "Republican Gov. Brian Kemp announced Thursday that the federal government approved that the Pathways to Coverage program will continue as part of the state-federal Medicaid program through December 2026. The five-year pilot program had been scheduled to expire next week, but Kemp argued Georgia should get more time because the program only started after a court battle with President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, which tried to shut it down.",
      "Georgia's program has been closely watched because Republicans mandated similar work requirements throughout the country as part of the tax and budget overhaul signed into law by Trump. Starting in 2027, some adults who seek Medicaid coverage must first show they are working, taking classes or performing community service for at least 80 hours a month.",
      "The Georgia program, which has similar work or activity requirements, has enrolled far fewer people than originally projected, covering 9,175 people as of August. It has spent twice as much on administrative costs than on providing actual health care. The Kemp administration had projected it would cover 25,000 people in its first year and up to 100,000 eventually.",
      "Critics warn the Georgia experience shows that millions will lose coverage under the Trump law because the administrative process will make it too difficult for them to document their work. Republicans have defended the low enrollment, saying Medicaid should be temporary for people who can get insurance through an employer.",
      "Pathways is Kemp's answer to pressure to expand Medicaid to cover all adults who earn less than 138% of federal poverty line wages, as originally envisioned under President Barack Obama's healthcare overhaul. Georgia is one of 10 Republican-led states that refused to expand coverage. Instead, Kemp launched Pathways, offering coverage to people who earn up to the poverty line \u2014 $15,650 a year. Georgia\u2019s traditional Medicaid program still covers poorer children, disabled adults, poor people in nursing homes and a few other very poor adults.",
      "Under the extension, Georgia will offer health coverage to parents and guardians of children younger than six without any additional work requirement. The state will also let beneficiaries report qualifying work or activity hours only once a yearly, instead of monthly. Some beneficiaries had said the monthly reporting process was glitchy and hard to use. Insurance will also start on the first day of the month that an application is received, meaning hospitals and doctors will have an incentive to help uninsured patients apply in hopes of getting paid for care already delivered. Right now, coverage doesn't start until after someone is approved.",

      "MADISON, Wis. -- Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin will stop scheduling patients for abortions starting next week as it works to find a way to provide the service in the face of Medicaid funding cuts in President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill, the nonprofit said Thursday.",
      "Abortion funding across the U.S. has been under siege, particularly Planned Parenthood affiliates, which are the biggest provider.",
      "The organization warned earlier this year that about half its clinics that provide abortion could be closed as a result of a ban on Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood for services other than abortion.",
      "The measure was part of the tax and spending law President Donald Trump signed in July. Initially, a judge said reimbursements must continue, but a federal appeals court this month said the government could halt the payments while a court challenge to the provision moves ahead.",
      "Planned Parenthood services include cancer screenings and sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment. Federal Medicaid money was already not paying for abortion, but affiliates relied on Medicaid to stay afloat.",
      "The remaining Planned Parenthood clinics in Louisiana \u2013 where abortion is banned \u2013 are scheduled to shut down at the end of this month.",
      "Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin said in a statement that it is trying to see as many patients as possible between now and Tuesday. The federal law takes effect Wednesday. It is not scheduling patients beyond that date and the organization believes the move will allow it to continue seeing other Medicaid patients. The organization said it was working with providers across the state to make sure patients are referred quickly and receive timely care.",
      "It is also considering taking legal action, the group said.",
      "\u201cPlanned Parenthood of Wisconsin will continue to provide the full spectrum of reproductive health care, including abortion, as soon and as we are able to,\u201d Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin President and CEO Tanya Atkinson said in the statement. \u201cIn the meantime, we are pursuing every available option through the courts, through operations, and civic engagement.\u201d",
      "The abortion landscape has been shifting frequently since the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2022 that allowed states to ban abortion. Currently, 12 states do not allow it at any stage of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and four more ban it after about six weeks\u2019 gestation.",
      "The bans have resulted in more women traveling for abortion and an increased reliance on abortion pills.

      "Every year, tons of heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and other drugs flow around the world",
      "UNITED NATIONS -- Every year, tons of heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and other drugs flow around the world, an underground river that crisscrosses borders and continents and spills over into violence, addiction and suffering. Yet when nations' leaders give the U.N. their annual take on big issues, drugs don't usually get much of the spotlight.",
      "But this was no usual year.",
      "First, U.S. President Donald Trump touted his aggressive approach to drug enforcement, including decisions to designate some Latin American cartels as foreign terrorist organizations and to carry out deadly military strikes on speedboats that he says said were carrying drugs in the southern Caribbean.",
      "\u201cTo every terrorist thug smuggling poisonous drugs into the United States of America: Please be warned that we will blow you out of existence,\u201d he boasted at the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday.",
      "Hours later, his Colombian counterpart fired back that Trump should face criminal charges for allowing an attack on unarmed \"young people who were simply trying to escape poverty.\u201d",
      "The U.S. \u201canti-drug policy is not aimed at the public health of a society, but rather to prop up a policy of domination,\u201d Colombia's Gustavo Petro bristled, accusing Washington of ignoring domestic drug dealing and production while demonizing his own country. The U.S. recently listed Colombia, for the first time in decades, as a nation falling short of its international drug control obligations.",
      "The barbs laid bare, on global diplomacy's biggest stage, the world's wide and pointed differences over how to deal with drugs.",
      "\u201cThe international system is extremely divided on drug policy,\u201d said Vanda Felbab-Brown, who has followed the topic as a senior fellow at the Washington-based Brookings Institution think tank. \u201cThis is not new, but it\u2019s really just very intense at this UNGA.\u201d",
      "While the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, climate change and other crises got much of the focus in the U.N.'s marathon week of speeches and meetings, the topic of drugs turned up from Trump's and Petro's tough talk to side events on such themes as gender-inclusive drug policy and international cooperation to fight organized crime.",
      "Some 316 million people worldwide used marijuana, opioids and/or other drugs in 2023, a 28% rise in a decade, according to the most recent statistics available from the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime. The figures don\u2019t count alcohol or tobacco use.",
      "The specifics vary by region, with cocaine use growing in Europe, methamphetamine on the rise in Southeast Asia, and synthetic opioids making new inroads in West and Central Africa and continuing to trouble North America, though opioid-related deaths have been falling.",
      "The U.N. drug office says trafficking is increasingly dominated by organized crime groups with tentacles and partnerships around the world, and nations need to think just as broadly about trying to tackle the syndicates.",
      "\u201cGovernments are increasingly seeing organized crime and drug trafficking as threats to national and regional security and stability, and some are coming around to the fact that they need to join up diplomatic, intelligence, law enforcement and central-bank efforts to push back,\u201d agency chief of staff Jeremy Douglas said by email.",
      "Although organized crime hasn't featured very prominently in top-level discussions at the General Assembly to date, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re at a point where this needs to, and hopefully will, change.\u201d",
      "Nations pair up in various joint counternarcotics operations and working groups and sometimes form regional coalitions, but some experts and leaders see a need to go global.",
      "Countries need to \u201cpool resources in a fight that must be a common cause among all nations,\u201d Panamanian President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino told the assembly. He said his nation had seized a \u201chistoric and alarming\u201d total of 150 tons of cocaine and other drugs this year alone.",

The International Narcotics Control Board monitors treaty compliance.",

It also says the military will no longer be paying for reservists or National Guard members to get the vaccine on their own time.",
      "News of the policy change, which has not been publicly announced by the Pentagon, comes as the Trump administration and its advisers have suggested changes to other vaccination guidance. An influential immunization panel that the administration updated to include anti-vaccine figures decided to not recommend the COVID-19 shot to anyone, while President Donald Trump used his platform to promote unproven and, in some cases, discredited ties between the pain reliever Tylenol, vaccines and autism.",
      "At the Pentagon, the flu shot memo declared that \u201cgoing forward, the Department will conserve its resources by requiring seasonal flu vaccination for Service members only when doing so most directly contributes to readiness.\" However, the document is not clear about the changes because it later says the annual requirement for active-duty troops is still in effect.",
      "While the memo was quietly sent months ago, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth drew attention to it Wednesday when he reposted a comment from an anonymous account that claimed they \u201cwon\u2019t be forced to get a flu shot this fall for the privilege of serving my state and country in the National Guard.\u201d",

      "On a visit to New Zealand, FBI Director Kash Patel gave the country\u2019s police and spy bosses gifts of inoperable pistols that were illegal to possess under local gun laws and had to be destroyed",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- On a visit to New Zealand, FBI Director Kash Patel gave the country\u2019s police and spy bosses gifts of inoperable pistols that were illegal to possess under local gun laws and had to be destroyed, New Zealand law enforcement agencies told The Associated Press.",
      "The plastic 3D-printed replica pistols formed part of display stands Patel presented to at least three senior New Zealand security officials in July. Patel, the most senior Trump administration official to visit the country so far, was in Wellington to open the FBI\u2019s first standalone office in New Zealand.",
      "Pistols are tightly restricted weapons under New Zealand law and possessing one requires an additional permit beyond a regular gun license. Law enforcement agencies didn\u2019t specify whether the officials who met with Patel held such permits, but they couldn\u2019t have legally kept the gifts if they didn\u2019t.",
      "It wasn't clear what permissions Patel had sought to bring the weapons into the country. A spokesperson for Patel told the AP Tuesday that the FBI would not comment.",
      "Inoperable weapons are treated as though they\u2019re operable in New Zealand if modifications could make them workable again. The pistols were judged by gun regulators to be potentially operable and were destroyed, New Zealand\u2019s Police Commissioner Richard Chambers told AP in a statement Tuesday.",
      "Chambers didn\u2019t specify how the weapons had been rendered inoperable before Patel gifted them. Usually this means the temporary disabling of the gun\u2019s firing mechanism.",
      "Three of New Zealand\u2019s most powerful law enforcement figures said they received the gifts at meetings July 31. Chambers was one recipient, and the other two were Andrew Hampton, Director-General of the country\u2019s human intelligence agency NZSIS, and Andrew Clark, Director-General of the technical intelligence agency GCSB, according to a joint statement from their departments.",
      "A spokesperson for the spy agencies described the gift as \u201ca challenge coin display stand\u201d that included the 3D-printed inoperable weapon \u201cas part of the design.\u201d The officials sought advice on the gifts the next day from the regulator that enforces New Zealand\u2019s gun laws, Chambers said.",
      "When the weapons were examined, it was discovered they were potentially operable.",
      "\u201cTo ensure compliance with firearms laws, I instructed Police to retain and destroy them,\u201d Chambers said.",
      "James Davidson, a former FBI agent who is now president of the FBI Integrity Project, a nonprofit that seeks to safeguard the bureau from undue partisan influence, has criticized Patel's appointment.",
      "But Davidson said the gift of the replica pistols appeared \u201ca genuine gesture\u201d from Patel and their destruction was \u201cquite frankly, an overreaction by the NZSIS, which could have simply rendered the replica inoperable,\u201d he said.",

An FBI statement in July said the move aligned New Zealand with FBI missions in other Five Eyes intelligence-sharing nations, which also include the United States, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom.",

It wasn\u2019t immediately clear Tuesday how many officials received the pistols as gifts.",
      "Patel had already provoked mild diplomatic discomfort in Wellington by suggesting in remarks supplied to reporters that the new FBI office aimed to counter China\u2019s influence in the South Pacific Ocean, where New Zealand is located. The comments prompted polite dismissal from officials in Wellington, who said the bolstered FBI presence was primarily to collaborate on child exploitation and drug smuggling crimes. Beijing decried Patel\u2019s remarks.",

If she had been denied bail, she would have been immediately removed from her position as an elected Member of Parliament.",
      "The court\u2019s action, though expected, underlines that Thailand's machinery of state remains deeply conservative, despite a recent change of government and the opposition People\u2019s Party\u2019s standing as the biggest party in Parliament. Thailand\u2019s political establishment is sensitive about any perceived threats to the status of the country\u2019s monarchy.",
      "Other recent appeals involving political activists have seen rulings that reversed the acquittal of lower courts or handed down longer prison sentences.",
      "Chonthicha\u2019s case is related to a speech she gave during a 2021 political rally in which she demanded the release of all political prisoners. She was found guilty for parts of the speech alleging that the then-government, led by Prayuth Chan-ocha, changed a law to give more power to King Maha Vajiralongkorn.",

      "Such is life these days for the NHL's rebuilding teams, looking to chart a course back to the playoffs in a league with a rising salary cap. Financial flexibility \u2014 when it comes to free agency, or using cap space to facilitate a trade \u2014 isn't what it used to be, putting an even bigger emphasis on player development.",
      "\u201c(Free agency) is something that\u2019s definitely a tool in our toolbox in roster building,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cBut I think the main one has to be and will be growing from within and building from within.\u201d",
      "The salary cap for this season is $95.5 million, up from $88 million. It goes up to $104 million for the 2026-27 season and $113.5 million in \u201927-28. Making the most of the NHL's healthy financial outlook, many of the league's top teams retained their best players this summer.",
      "Mitch Marner went from Toronto to Las Vegas in a sign-and-trade deal before free agency started, and Nikolaj Ehlers waited until July 3 before agreeing to a $51 million, six-year contract with Carolina. But depth pieces made up most of the free agent market.",
      "Kirill Kaprizov agreed to a $136 million, eight-year contract with Minnesota that was announced on Tuesday. The 28-year-old Kaprizov could have hit free agency after this season, but the talented forward stayed with the Wild for a record-setting deal.",
      "\u201cYou saw it this summer,\u201d Columbus general manager Don Waddell said. \u201cSummers before you\u2019d always have seven, eight, nine teams that had to move money to get under the cap. You didn\u2019t see that this summer. ... I think going forward you\u2019re going to see less free agency. You\u2019re going to see teams locking up their own players if they can.\u201d",
      "A diminished level of free agency puts the NHL's non-playoff teams in the same boat, facing even more pressure to grow their own stars.",
      "\u201cUltimately, for teams in our situation, I think you need those young players coming in to build that core,\" Detroit general manager Steve Yzerman said.",
      "Developing those young players goes beyond the organization, stretching to its draft picks on college, junior and international club teams. Anton Frondell, an 18-year-old forward who was selected by Chicago with the No. 2 overall pick in this year's draft, is staying in Sweden this season, and Vaclav Nestrasil, another first-rounder for the Blackhawks, is playing for the University of Massachusetts.",
      "When it comes to their prospects in other programs, NHL teams stay in close contact with their players and the coaching staffs on their teams. It doesn't sound as if Davidson and the Blackhawks have any plans to alter their approach even with their development focus.",

      "\u201cWe let the player, we\u2019re an input into their decision-making process, and then we let them go,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cAnd then once they\u2019re in an environment, in a program, we try and work with and alongside the coaching staff, because what we don\u2019t want is our player to be put in the crosshairs or at an intersection of our direction and the coaching staff direction with where they\u2019re at, and then the player has just got a million things in their head.\"",
      "Technology has become a major part of player development across the NHL. The Blackhawks use an internal app to share video, tips and other information with their current players and the prospects in their system. Davidson described the Blackhawks as \u201cactively investigating\u201d how it can use artificial intelligence within the organization.",

      "Drugmaker Pfizer has agreed to lower drug costs under a deal struck with President Donald Trump's administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- Drugmaker Pfizer has agreed to lower drug costs under a deal struck with the Trump administration, President Donald Trump said Tuesday, as he promised similar deals will be struck with other drugmakers facing a threat of tariffs.",
      "The announcement, which Trump made with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla at the White House, came as the Republican president has for months sought to lower drug costs. It also came as Washington faced a federal government shutdown at midnight amid a standoff between Democrats and Republicans over health care and its costs.",
      "Under the agreement, New York-based Pfizer will charge most-favored-nation pricing to Medicaid and guarantee that pricing on newly launched drugs, Trump said. That involves matching the lowest price offered in other developed nations.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how big this is,\" the president said.",
      "\u201cI think,\" Bourla said, \u201ctoday we are turning the tide and we are reversing an unfair situation.\u201d",
      "Trump has been talking for months about the need to lower drug prices. In May, he issued an executive order that gave drugmakers 30 days to electively lower prices or face new limits on what the government will pay.",
      "To persuade them to strike deals, Trump said he threatened to impose tariffs \u2014 a favorite tool of his to use as leverage across all areas of government \u2014 but that move could raise drug prices.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how the new policy will affect patients in Medicaid, the state and federally funded program for people with low incomes. They often pay a nominal co-payment of a few dollars to fill their prescriptions, but lower prices could help state budgets that fund the programs.",
      "Lower drug prices also will help patients who have no insurance coverage and little leverage to negotiate better deals on what they pay.",
      "\u201cThis is something that most people said was not doable,\u201d Trump said Tuesday.",
      "One thing that is not doable, however, was Trump\u2019s repeated claim that it would cut drug prices by more than 100%, \u201c14, 15, 1,600% reductions in some cases,\u201d he said.",
      "A 100% reduction would make the drugs free. Cuts greater than that would essentially mean people are paid to take the drugs.",
      "Trump said he\u2019s making deals with other drugmakers, and \u201cthey\u2019re all coming in over the next week.\u201d",
      "Besides committing to lowering costs, Trump said, Pfizer agreed to spend $70 billion in domestic manufacturing facilities, becoming the latest in a string of major drugmakers to announce plans to build production in the United States.",

      "The woman reached out to Zavala's family on a GoFundMe page and told them about the experience she had on the roller coaster.",
      "\u201cAll we want is answers regarding my son\u2019s death,\" Zavala's mother, Ana Zavala, said through an interpreter at Tuesday's news conference. \u201cWe want these answers so we can be able to honor him.

      "Lin-Manuel Miranda and his family have helped Puerto Rican arts recover after Hurricane Maria",
      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- As Hurricane Maria roared over Puerto Rico in September 2017, Marena P\u00e9rez and Aureo Andino hunkered down inside their ballet studio. The couple never imagined that they, their daughter and P\u00e9rez\u2019s parents would live there for three months, sleeping on pullout couches and relying on a gas generator.",
      "The Category 4 hurricane flooded P\u00e9rez and Andino\u2019s house with 4 feet of water. Unable to return home, the founders and directors of Mauro Ballet decided to open their doors to the community, teaching a free dance class each afternoon.",
      "\u201cIt became an oasis for dancers in Puerto Rico,\u201d said Andino. But Mauro Ballet still struggled \u2014 the dance company didn\u2019t make money for 18 months.",
      "It survived in part thanks to support from the Flamboyan Arts Fund, a $22 million initiative propelled by Lin-Manuel Miranda and his family, and funded mainly by money raised during a 2019 run of Miranda\u2019s acclaimed Broadway musical \u201cHamilton\u201d in San Juan.",
      "\u201cArtists always get left out of the conversation,\u201d Miranda, an award-winning writer and performer whose parents were raised in Puerto Rico, told The Associated Press. \u201cWe wanted to make sure they were not forgotten in relief efforts.\u201d",
      "Instead of being forgotten, artists assumed essential roles, helping the archipelago grieve from Maria\u2019s devastation and articulating the challenges Puerto Ricans faced.",
      "\u201cYou can use the arts in so many ways to express your feelings, and to heal,\u201d said P\u00e9rez.",
      "The Flamboyan Arts Fund has supported 110 Puerto Rican arts organizations and 900 artists. Now the Miranda family and the D.C.-based Flamboyan Foundation are committing an additional $10 million to Puerto Rican arts and culture.",
      "Despite federal funding cuts to arts and humanities, the new phase of giving is meant to go beyond emergency relief \u2014 helping arts and culture thrive and even become an economic driver for the archipelago.",
      "\u201cIt just gives us too much back,\u201d said Miranda, 45. \u201cIf you have ever enjoyed the work that comes from this island and its descendants, to invest in that future is important.\u201d",
      "Hurricane Maria led to an estimated nearly 3,000 deaths, most of them related to the lack of power, clean water, and other services. Damages surpassed $115 billion, and power outages lasted 11 months in some places.",
      "The destruction was so vast that Marianne Ram\u00edrez Aponte, executive director and chief curator of the Museo de Arte Contempor\u00e1neo in San Juan, worried the cultural sector could not overcome it.",
      "What happened instead was \u201cquite the opposite,\u201d she said.",
      "Arts groups opened their spaces as relief hubs and activated mutual aid networks. \u201cCultural brigades\u201d deployed their talents to comfort and entertain.",
      "\u201cIt was a horrible situation, but we were able to prove the importance of art in the social process,\u201d said Yari Helfeld, executive director of the community theater company Y No Hab\u00eda Luz.",
      "Helfeld got requests to perform from isolated communities in Puerto Rico\u2019s central mountains just weeks after the storm. She was surprised to be asked for theater when people still struggled to access food and water.",
      "\u201cThey said, \u2018You\u2019re helping heal the spirit,\u2019\u201d said Helfeld.",
      "Artists could also channel and contextualize the public frustration over the U.S. territory\u2019s slow recovery. Maria exposed the consequences of what many Puerto Ricans still consider a colonial relationship with the U.S.",

      "Republicans have crafted a short-term measure to fund the government through Nov. 21, but Democrats have insisted the measure address their concerns on health care. They want to reverse the Medicaid cuts in President Donald Trump's mega-bill passed this summer and extend tax credits that make health insurance premiums more affordable for millions of people who purchase through the marketplaces established by the Affordable Care Act. Republicans call the Democratic proposal a nonstarter.",

      "During the 35-day partial shutdown in Trump's first term, 340,000 of the 800,000 federal workers at affected agencies were furloughed. The remainder were \u201cexcepted\" and required to work.",

      "U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth in Washington, D.C., ruled that the U.S. Agency for Global Media cannot implement a reduction in force eliminating 532 jobs for full-time government employees on Tuesday. Those employees represent the vast majority of its remaining staff.",
      "Kari Lake, the agency\u2019s acting CEO, announced in late August that the job cuts would take effect Tuesday. But the judge's ruling preserves the status quo at the agency until he rules on a plaintiffs' underlying motion to block the reduction in force.",
      "Lamberth previously ruled that President Donald Trump\u2019s Republican administration must restore VOA programming to levels commensurate with its statutory mandate to \u201cserve as a consistently reliable and authoritative source of news.\u201d He also blocked Lake from removing Michael Abramowitz as VOA\u2019s director.",
      "Lamberth accused the administration of showing \u201cconcerning disrespect\u201d toward the court in response to his earlier orders to produce information about its plans for Voice of America. He noted that the agency initiated the job cuts only hours after a hearing last month in which government lawyers said a reduction in force, or RIF, was merely a possibility.",
      "\u201cThe defendants\u2019 obfuscation of this Court\u2019s request for information regarding whether their RIF plans comported with the preliminary injunction has wasted precious judicial time and resources and readily support contempt proceedings,\u201d Lamberth wrote.",

      "\u201cHowever, (the court\u2019s) deference to the plaintiffs with respect to further proceedings should not be mistaken for lenience toward the defendants\u2019 egregious erstwhile conduct,\u201d he added.",
      "Employees who sued to block the dismantling of Voice of America claimed the planned cuts would hamper the judge\u2019s ability to enforce the injunction he issued in April. \u201cThis Court should therefore preserve the status quo while the parties litigate compliance,\u201d their attorneys wrote.",
      "Government lawyers accused the plaintiffs of impermissibly trying to micromanage the agency\u2019s operations. \u201cEnjoining the reductions in force would be a wholly overbroad and improper remedy,\u201d they wrote.",

      "New rules that limit the access of journalists in the Pentagon and appear to condition entry into the building on agreement to restrictions have led to a standoff between the press and the Trump administration's defense department",
      "Journalists who cover the Pentagon and the Trump admnistration are in a standoff about new rules that limit the access of the media to most areas within the Pentagon and appear to condition overall entry to the building on an agreement to restrictions in reporting.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's team characterizes the changes as an effort to protect national security and the safety of those who work at the Pentagon, while many in the press see it as an effort to exert control and avoid embarrassing stories.",
      "Journalists who want to hold on to badges that permit access to the Pentagon were told on Sept. 19 they must sign a letter acknowledging the new rules by this Tuesday or the badge \u201cwill be revoked.\u201d The new policy says that Defense Department information \u201cmust be approved for public release by an appropriate authorizing official before it is released, even if unclassified.\u201d Classified material faces even tighter restrictions.",
      "That level of control immediately alarmed journalists and their advocates.",
      "\u201cAsking independent journalists to submit to these kinds of restrictions is at stark odds with the constitutional protections of a free press in a democracy, and a continued attempt to throttle the public's right to understand what their government is doing,\u201d said Charles Stadtlander, spokesman for The New York Times.",
      "In a subsequent letter to the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, Hegseth aide Sean Parnell suggested that journalists misunderstood some of the new rules. He said, for example, that the restriction against releasing unclassified information is the policy that Pentagon officials must follow \u2014 not something the journalists must abide by.",
      "\u201cIt should come as no surprise that the mainstream media is once again misrepresenting the Pentagon's press procedures,\u201d Parnell said in a post on X. \u201cLet's be absolutely clear: Journalists are not required to clear their stories with us. That claim is a lie.\u201d",
      "However, the new policy says that journalists who encourage Pentagon officials to break the rules \u2014 in other words, ask sources for information \u2014 could be subject to losing their building access.",
      "While it appeared that Parnell sought to soften some of the hard edges of his policy in response to questions raised by the reporters' committee, there's still enough confusion to merit a meeting to clear things up, said Grayson Clary, a lawyer for RCFP. There's some wariness among news organizations about what they would be agreeing to if they sign the letter, and it's not clear how many people \u2014 if any \u2014 have done so.",
      "The new rules continue a tense relationship between the press and the Hegseth team, which had already evicted some news outlets from their regular workspaces in favor of friendlier outlets and limited the ability of reporters to roam around the Pentagon. Hegseth and Parnell seldom hold press briefings.",
      "Parnell did not respond to a request for comment by The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cIt's control, just 100% control,\u201d said Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine. Goldberg, who is not stationed at the Pentagon, wrote the most embarrassing story of Hegseth's tenure so far when he was inadvertently included in a Signal group chat where Hegseth and other national officials discussed an imminent attack on Houthis in Yemen. The brouhaha became widely known as \u201cSignalgate.\u201d",
      "Pentagon leadership was also reportedly unhappy over a story that said Elon Musk was to get a briefing on military strategy for China, leading President Donald Trump to stop it, and other stories about initial assessments of damage in the military strike against Iran.",
      "No American reporter accredited to the Pentagon that he knows is interested in subverting national security or putting anyone in the military in harm's way, Goldberg said.",
      "In his own case, Goldberg did not report on what he learned until after the attack was over. He said he contacted officials in the group chat to ask if there was anything he learned that was harmful to the country in any way. He did not include in his story the name of a CIA official mentioned in the messages who was technically still undercover, he said.",
      "\u201cThe only people in Signalgate who were putting American troops in harm's way were the national leadership of the United States by discussing on a commercial messaging app the launch times of strikes on a hostile country,\u201d he said.",

      "Priest said the corridors of the Pentagon were like areas around Congress where reporters buttonhole politicians. Priest recalled staking out military officials waiting for them to come out of a bathroom.",
      "\u201cThey know the goal of the media is to get around the official gobbledygook and get out the truth,\u201d Priest said. \u201cThey may not help you. But some of them want to help Americans know what is going on.\u201d",
      "Experienced national security reporters know there are many ways to get information, including through other channels of government and people in the private sector. \u201cThe Pentagon is always very well versed in the advantages of controlling the story, so they always try to do that,\u201d she said. \u201cThe reporters know that. They've known that for decades.\u201d",
      "Reporters who don\u2019t follow the new rules won\u2019t necessarily be expelled immediately, Parnell told the reporter\u2019s committee. But access will be determined by Hegseth\u2019s team.",
      "While reporters already stationed in the Pentagon were given until Sept. 30 to sign, they were allowed to request an additional five days for legal review.",
      "Although the Times, Washington Post and Atlantic all put out statements against the Pentagon's plan, none of the publications would say what they have recommended that their reporters do \u2014 perhaps an indication that they consider negotiations potentially fruitful.",
      "President Donald Trump hasn't hesitated to fight the media when he thinks he's been wronged, launching lawsuits against CBS News, ABC News, The Wall Street Journal and the Times. Yet he's also frequently accessible to the press, more so than many of his predecessors, and there has been some uncertainty in the White House about the Pentagon's policy.",
      "When a reporter asked, \u201cshould the Pentagon be in charge of deciding what reporters can report on?\u201d the president replied, \u201cNo, I don't think so. Listen, nothing stops reporters. You know that.\u201d",
      "Goldberg noted that it's more than just an issue for reporters. \u201cThe American people have a right to know what the world's most powerful military does in their name and with their money,\u201d he said. \u201cThat seems fairly obvious to me.\u201d",

      "CSX railroad replaced its CEO less than two months after an investment fund urged it to either find another railroad to merge with to better compete with the proposed transcontinental Union Pacific railroad or fire outgoing CEO Joe Hinrichs",
      "CSX railroad announced Monday that it had replaced its CEO less than two months after an investment fund urged it to either find another railroad to merge with to better compete with the proposed transcontinental Union Pacific railroad or fire outgoing CEO Joe Hinrichs.",
      "The outgoing CEO, who came to the railroad in 2022 after a long career with Ford, focused on repairing CSX's relationship with its workers and labor unions and unifying the team after a bitter contract fight. But Ancora Holdings, which helped spur major changes at Norfolk Southern, said CSX's operating performance deteriorated significantly under Hinrichs' leadership. Hinrichs resigned to clear the way for Steve Angel to become CEO effective Sunday.",
      "Angel, 70, also comes from outside the rail industry although earlier in his career he oversaw GE's locomotive building unit, so he does have that experience. CSX said he has 45 years experience leading large public companies, including most recently as CEO of Linde and Praxair that provide industrial gasses to other companies.",
      "\u201cWe are excited to welcome Steve as our new CEO. He is a visionary in creating long-term value and an expert in guiding companies through significant transformation,\" the railroad's board Chairman John Zillmer said.",
      "CSX has been under pressure from Ancora and other investors since Union Pacific announced its $85 billion deal to acquire Norfolk Southern, which is CSX's rival in the eastern United States. But both BNSF and CPKC railroads said they aren't interested in a merger right now.",
      "Ancora said CSX has delivered disappointing shareholder returns and poor financial performance during Hinrichs' tenure. But over the past year, CSX was working on two major construction projects \u2014 repairs from Hurricane Helene and a major tunnel renovation in Baltimore \u2014 that disrupted the railroad. Both those projects were just completed this month, so CSX's performance was expected to improve in the fourth quarter.",
      "Even though he's not a railroader, Ancora praised Angel's hiring because of his experience with mergers and acquisitions. The top executives at Ancora, Frederick D. DiSanto and James Chadwick, said in their statement that they believe Hinrichs \u201cbotched the opportunity\u201d to merge with another railroad and may have even fought the idea. They said Angel is expected to be more aggressive at pursuing a deal and that he will re-evaluate the railroad's leadership team.",
      "\u201cWith President Donald Trump and other policymakers recently expressing enthusiasm for the benefits of a transcontinental railroad, CSX and other Class I railroads have no choice but to embrace the industry\u2019s new realities,\u201d the Ancora executives said. \u201cAlthough Steve Angel is not a railroader by trade, his M&A pedigree and value creation record indicate his appointment is an initial step in the right direction for CSX.\u201d",
      "Angel promised to make improvements at the Jacksonville, Florida-based company, which is one of the six largest railroads in North America.",

      "\u201cMy top priorities will be to ensure the safety of the railroad and our employees, deliver reliable service to our customers, and increase value for our shareholders,\u201d Angel said in a statement.",
      "Angel will earn a $1.5 million salary, but he will also be eligible for a performance stock grant targeted at $13.5 million next year if CSX hits certain performance goals. He will also receive a separate $10 million stock grant that will vest after three years based on performance. Angel will also be eligible to collect retirement from the railroad after three years. CSX also outlined a separate agreement that would pay Angel triple his salary and target bonus in the event of another railroad taking control of CSX.",
      "Ancora said it continues to buy more CSX shares and hopes to develop a better relationship with the railroad. Ancora holds three seats on Norfolk Southern's board after running a proxy campaign there to oust the previous CEO at that railroad, so the investment fund had input on the Union Pacific-Norfolk Southern merger.",
      "CFRA Research analyst Emily Nasseff Mitsch said Angel\u2019s experience overseeing the complex merger of Linde and Praxair should give CSX a strategic edge in any potential rail consolidation.",
      "Most observers believe CSX and BNSF will be at a disadvantage if the Union Pacific-Norfolk Southern merger gets approved. That transcontinental railroad will be able to shave more than a day off delivery times because it won\u2019t have to hand off shipments between railroads in the middle of the country. So far, those railroads have said they believe they could achieve most of the benefits of a merger through cooperative agreements.",
      "\u201cAngel brings exceptional credentials from 22 years at GE\u2019s locomotive operations and demonstrated value creation, generating over 200% returns at Linde and Praxair while executing major industrial mergers. We believe this positions CSX for its next growth phase,\u201d Mitsch said.",
      "CSX shares gained more than 5% Monday after the new CEO was announced.",

      "The 800-patient study by a German drugmaker is the latest evidence of the therapeutic properties of cannabis, which remains illegal under U.S. federal law even as most states have made it available for medical or recreational use.",
      "Health officials in Canada and Europe have previously approved a pharmaceutical-grade form of cannabis for several types of pain, including nerve pain due to multiple sclerosis.

      "Unlike that drug, known as Epidiolex, the new cannabis formula from drugmaker Vertanical contains THC, the active ingredient in marijuana that gets users high. But levels of the chemical are very low, essentially a microdose compared to what\u2019s available in gummies, chocolate bars and other products sold at marijuana dispensaries in the U.S. The company said patients in the trial didn\u2019t show any signs of drug abuse, dependence or withdrawal.",
      "Driving is not recommended during the first few weeks of taking the drug, although the company said the decision of whether to drive was ultimately left to patients.",
      "Vertanical is seeking approval for a large group of patients: those suffering from lower-back pain, a chronic condition that affects millions and has few proven treatments.",
      "Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen can\u2019t be used for long-term pain because of their side effects, which include stomach ulcers and indigestion. Opioids are no longer recommended, after the overprescribing of painkillers such as OxyContin in the 1990s and 2000s led to the ongoing epidemic of addiction to that class of drug.",
      "Chronic pain is one of the most frequently cited conditions of people enrolled in state-run medical marijuana programs. But there's been little rigorous research on the drug's use in that group.",
      "Lead study author Dr. Matthias Karst said in an email that the new findings show cannabis \"can significantly reduce pain and improve physical function in patients with chronic low-back pain, without the safety concerns commonly associated with opioids.\u201d Karst is a pain specialist at Hannover Medical School and a consultant for Vertanical.",

      "So you're booking your flight, and just when you're about to check out, the airline asks if you'd like to pay a little something to offset your share of the flight's pollution. Or, maybe you're an environmentally minded person, and you've heard you can buy these things called carbon offsets.",
      "Are they worth it? Let's explore.",
      "A roundtrip flight from New York to Los Angeles emits more than 1,300 pounds (about 614 kilograms) of planet-warming carbon dioxide per passenger, according to an emissions calculator from the International Civil Aviation Organization. That's about the amount of pollution you'd save if you swore off meat for 17 months.",
      "Jet engines burn fossil fuels, releasing planet-warming gases into the atmosphere. They also release water vapor, which turns into long, thin clouds called contrails that trap heat instead of letting it escape to space \u2014 additional warming that isn't typically included in a flight's emissions, said Diane Vitry, aviation director at a clean energy advocacy organization called the European Federation for Transport and Environment.",
      "Reducing emissions from air travel is difficult. Batteries weigh too much and provide too little power for long flights. Sustainable aviation fuel \u2014 biofuels made from things like corn, oil seeds and algae that can be mixed with jet fuel \u2014 is currently more expensive than traditional fuel and lacking sufficient supply to be in wide use.",
      "\u201cAviation is the problem child,\u201d Vitry said. \u201cAviation and shipping are not decarbonizing, and definitely not fast enough.\u201d",
      "That's where carbon offsets come in.",
      "A carbon offset is a certificate or a permit to emit planet-warming gases. It's connected to something that stores or reduces carbon emissions \u2014 for example, planting trees, or funding renewable energy.",
      "The idea is that the program or action offsets your pollutive action. You drive a car that pollutes a certain amount, you buy a carbon offset that leads to the planting of a tree that sequesters the same amount, and bam: the pollutive action (driving) is offset (tree planting).",
      "They've gotten popular enough that there's an entire marketplace that connects people and companies wanting to reduce their impacts with other companies that promise to do so.",

      "Sure, you can plant a tree, but Vitry said that doesn\u2019t stop your flight's emissions from entering the atmosphere. The tree may eventually absorb an equivalent amount of emissions. Or it may die. Or it may be sold as an offset multiple times by an unscrupulous company, meaning the tree can't possible absorb all the emissions it's supposed to.",

      "She said that\u2019s partly because the voluntary offset market is largely unregulated, and it\u2019s really difficult to measure offsets. The other problem is everyone involved benefits from over-exaggerating the benefits of offsets. \u201cThe buyer of the credit wants the cheap credits, the seller of the credits wants to get more credits for the same activity and the third party verifier is hired by the project developer, so has a conflict of interest to be lenient,\u201d Haya said.",

      "The Florida Panthers are going for the first Stanley Cup threepeat since the early 1980s",
      "The immense challenge of threepeating as Stanley Cup champion got even more difficult for the Florida Panthers when they lost their captain and arguably most important player for the next 7-9 months to a knee injury.",
      "Even without Aleksander Barkov, the Panthers have a chance to do something no NHL team has done in more than 40 years. And in between the rest of the league trying to stop their dynasty, the world's best hockey players will return to the Olympics for the first time in over a decade, fresh off the wildly successful 4 Nations Face-Off that reminded fans just how good the game is on the international stage.",

      "Hedman and the Lightning won the Cup back to back in 2020 and \u201821. Crosby\u2019s Pittsburgh Penguins did it in \u201816 and \u201917. No team has gone back to back to back since the New York Islanders won four consecutive championships from 1980-83.",
      "During an offseason availability, Hedman joked, \u201cThey're not going to win three in a row\u201d as he walked past Florida star Sam Reinhart, but who's betting against a team that has won 11 of 12 playoff series since trading for Matthew Tkachuk and hiring Paul Maurice as coach?",
      "Barkov's long-term injury, and Tkachuk likely missing the first two months after his own surgery gives the Panthers longer odds. They're now 11-1 to win it all, behind co-favorites Edmonton and Vegas as well as Carolina, Colorado and Dallas, according to BetMGM Sportsbook.",
      "\u201cBe the best you can be at the start of the season: That\u2019s all you can focus on,\u201d Reinhart said. \u201cWhat we learned last year is throughout it, you kind of have that \u2014 not necessarily doubt, but you kind of wonder if you\u2019re going to have it again, that juice, that energy. You just kind of trust that you\u2019ll find it when the time comes.\u201d",
      "Champions usually suffer a bit of attrition, but with the salary cap increasing a record amount, Florida kept all three of its big three free agents: playoff MVP Sam Bennett, defenseman Aaron Ekblad and winger Brad Marchand, whose acquisition at the trade deadline paved the way for another parade in Fort Lauderdale.",

      "Edmonton, with McDavid and longtime running mate Leon Draisaitl, is an 8-1 Cup co-favorite with Vegas. After Minnesota signed Kirill Kaprizov to a record-setting $136 million contract just before the season started, all eyes are on McDavid, who could break the bank if he stays or goes.",

      "Gavin McKenna, a top prospect for the 2026 NHL draft, made headlines in July by leaving the Western Hockey League to play for Penn State",
      "STATE COLLEGE, Pa. -- Gavin McKenna admits he didn\u2019t watch a lot of college hockey growing up in Western Canada.",
      "But the projected 2026 NHL draft\u2019s top prospect saw enough last season to know he wanted to play for Penn State.",
      "McKenna met with reporters Monday for the first time since shocking the hockey world in July by announcing his departure from the Western Hockey League to commit to Guy Gadowsky\u2019s Nittany Lions.",
      "\u201cSeeing what these guys did last year, making it to the Frozen Four, that was a big influence on me,\u201d McKenna said. \u201cI wanted to come to a winning team and I thought this was the spot.\u201d",
      "The 17-year-old was already the main man for a winning program.",
      "He finished second in the WHL with 129 points (41 goals, 88 assists) in 56 games last season and was the league\u2019s player of the year. He led the Medicine Hat Tigers to the WHL championship and Memorial Cup finals.",
      "In his three seasons for Medicine Hat, McKenna had 79 goals and 165 assists.",
      "Now he aims to provide even more scoring and playmaking for the Nittany Lions who return their top six scorers from last season\u2019s squad that fell a game short of playing for an NCAA title.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s continuing on where we left off and I think Gavin was really adamant about that when coming in and talking about the reasons why,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cHe\u2019s here to enhance that, not change that.\u201d",
      "McKenna is joined by new teammates Lev Katzin, Luke Misa and Shea Van Olm, and defensemen Jackson Smith and Nolan Collins who are among the nearly 325 CHL players who have committed to Division I college programs this year.",
      "The NCAA lifted its ban on CHL players in November, paving the way for McKenna and other CHL players \u2014 previously considered professionals because they received stipends for living expenses \u2014 to defect to the NCAA ranks.",
      "McKenna, living on his own for the first time nearly 3,500 miles from his home in Whitehorse in Canada\u2019s Yukon Territory, has already made a strong first impression on his coaches and teammates.",
      "Gadowsky said McKenna, is a \u201cchill, great hang\u201d while team captain Dane Dowiak called him a normal guy who \u201cjust wants to win.\u201d",
      "They\u2019ve all been mesmerized by the winger\u2019s hockey IQ, speed and ability to think and react before defenders can get a bead on him.",
      "\u201cHe does think the game differently,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cHe\u2019s a different animal when it comes to that. Not only compared to any other freshman, compared to anybody.\u201d",
      "But there are areas where the phenom will be tested, Gadowsky said.",

      "Notably, McKenna goes from being one of the older players in the WHL where players as young as 15 can suit up, to one of the youngest in the NCAA ranks.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s going to be playing against guys eight years older that have been lifting weights in a very structured environment for a long time,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, he\u2019s 17 so there is going to be a transition process, there really is.\u201d",
      "McKenna is counting on it.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot less time and space,\u201d McKenna said. \u201cThe guys are bigger, faster, older. It\u2019s not too different in terms of skill and stuff. Obviously both leagues are very skilled and guys can make plays, but in terms of speed and size, I think that\u2019s the biggest difference.\u201d",
      "Listed at 6-foot, 170 pounds, McKenna said he considered the length of the NCAA season a positive and negative when making his decision.",
      "A negative because he loves the game and wants to play as much as possible. Even with a postseason run, Penn State played 40 games last year. McKenna skated in more than 60 games each of the last two seasons with Medicine Hat.",
      "The positive? He\u2019ll have some time to develop physically for what comes after his time in Happy Valley.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m itching to play games,\u201d McKenna said. \u201cWith that though, that\u2019s a reason I came here is because less games, more time in the gym. I\u2019m not a big guy, so I want to put on weight and that was part of the reason I came here.\u201d",
      "And to win.",
      "Aiden Fink, the team\u2019s leading scorer last season with 23 goals and 30 assists, is looking forward to skating with McKenna and is ready for the extra attention on the program.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be an exciting year for us, definitely,\u201d Fink said.",

      "Democratic senators are proposing a bill that would rewrite a 1961 law prohibiting college sports conferences from banding together to sell their media rights",
      "Democratic senators introduced a bill Monday that would rewrite a 1961 law prohibiting college sports conferences from banding together to sell their media rights. It's a move they say is designed to protect athletes, Olympics sports and smaller leagues that could be getting priced out of the increasingly expensive business of name, image and likeness deals.",
      "Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., joined with Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Cory Booker, D-N.J., in backing the Student Athlete Fairness and Enforcement (SAFE) Act, a bill that gives lawmakers an alternative to a bill on the House side that has yet to come up for a floor vote.",
      "\u201cWe take a broader approach of: How do we solve the fundamental problem of implementing NIL rights, but also keeping revenue for women's and Olympic sports and an environment where everyone feels like they can compete?\u201d Cantwell said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cAnd we're maximizing for consumers and the public the amount of content available.\u201d",
      "Conferences currently sell their media rights separately, with the Big Ten, for instance, distributing around $958 million to its schools from the proceeds while the Big 12 number is at around $558 million \u2014 a 52.7% difference. All conferences are part of the $7.8 billion ESPN deal for the College Football Playoff, though the Big Ten and Southeastern Conference get more money from it.",
      "Cantwell has previously said she wants to prevent college sports from turning into a \u201cPower 2,\u201d featuring those leagues, with everyone else contending for scraps.",
      "Uunder terms of the landmark House antitrust settlement, schools as of July 1 are allowed to share up to 22% of their revenues \u2014 or around $20.5 million \u2014 from TV and other proceeds to pay players for their NIL during this school year.",
      "It has left some in the non-\u201cPower 2\u201d conferences wondering how they can draw top talent in football and basketball \u2014 the main revenue drivers \u2014 while maintaining smaller sports that form the pipeline for the teams America sends to the Olympics.",
      "The Democratic proposal, which would offer schools the same antitrust protection it does for the NFL and other pro leagues regarding their TV rights, is what billionaire Texas Tech regents chair Cody Campbell has proposed, going as far as running 30-second TV ads devoted to the topic on college football broadcasts.",
      "\u201cI think he thinks this is a way to even out the resources among all schools so that we can still have \u2018Any Given Saturday\u2019\u201d in college football, Cantwell said.",
      "Investors have floated ideas of super leagues, which would presumably involve pooling all the major-conference TV rights, estimating it could drive up to a $15 billion increase in revenue.",
      "Cantwell positions her bill as an alternative to the SCORE Act, which started with momentum but has recently stalled on the House side despite support from the NCAA.",

      "Three key elements to that bill included provisions granting the NCAA limited antitrust protection \u2014 especially in the area of preventing lawsuits over eligibility \u2014 prohibiting athletes from becoming employees of their schools and pre-empting state laws with a larger federal law.",
      "Cantwell's bill keeps the pre-emption idea but does not include the other two.",
      "\u201cThose closest to college sports ... have consistently called on Congress to take action to address the actual threats facing collegiate athletics,\" NCAA senior vice president Tim Buckley said. \u201cThis includes protecting student-athletes from being forced to become employees, and ensuring academic standards and other commonsense rules can be applied consistently.\u201d",
      "Cantwell's bill also offers strengthened protections for athletes from losing scholarships or health care. It would limit the number of times an athlete could transfer schools to two. It would give the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general authority to go after parties who violate rules written to oversee third-party collectives that now fund and oversee many of the NIL deals.",
      "The bill calls for football and basketball games to not be behind a paywall in local markets, a provision similar to how the NFL operates and that National Association of Broadcasters president Curtis LeGeyt said would strengthen \u201cthe unique connection between universities, their communities and the student-athletes who inspire them.\u201d",
      "The bill also calls on schools to use extra revenue generated from the new pooled media rights to maintain scholarships and roster spots for Olympic and women's sports at the same or greater levels than they were in 2023-24.",
      "\u201cWe're trying to be creative in how we can help some of these non-revenue sports grow in the future,\u201d Cantwell said.",

      "\u201cMets fans everywhere.

      "President of Baseball Operations David Stearns immediately took the blame at a Citi Field news conference for a club he said \u201cunderachieved greatly,\u201d acknowledging New York's pitching and defense were especially problematic as the Mets went 38-55 over their last 93 games.",
      "The players acquired leading up to the July 31 trade deadline were mostly major flops in New York, namely Cedric Mullins, Ryan Helsley and Gregory Soto, and Stearns lamented \u201cwe didn\u2019t do a good enough job of fortifying our team when we had injuries midseason.\u201d",

      "The Minnesota Twins have fired manager Rocco Baldelli, ending his seven-year tenure that included three AL Central titles after a second straight disappointing season",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- The Minnesota Twins fired manager Rocco Baldelli on Monday, ending his seven-year tenure that included three AL Central titles after a second straight disappointing season.",
      "Minnesota announced Baldelli's firing following a season marked by a major selloff leading up to the trade deadline after the team faltered in June and failed to mount any momentum in July. The Twins (70-92) went 19-35 after the deadline passed following the departure of 10 players off their major league roster, with only the Colorado Rockies faring worse over the final two months.",
      "The Twins finished with the fourth-worst record in the major leagues and their worst mark since 2016, when they went 59-103 after firing longtime general manager Terry Ryan at midseason. Current team president Derek Falvey was hired to replace Ryan after that.",
      "\"Over the past seven years Rocco has been much more than our manager. He has been a trusted partner and teammate to me in leading this organization,\u201d Falvey said in a statement. \u201cTogether we shared a deep care for the Twins, for our players and staff, and for doing everything in our power to put this club in the best position to succeed. Along the way we experienced some meaningful accomplishments, and I will always be proud of those, even as I wish we had ultimately achieved more.",
      "\u201cThis is a difficult day because of what Rocco represents to so many people here. He led with honesty, integrity, and an unwavering commitment to our players and staff. He gave himself fully to this role and I have tremendous respect and gratitude for the way he carried himself and the way he showed up every single day.\"",
      "For the second straight year, uncertainty around Baldelli\u2019s status hovered around the club. The Twins, who went 87-75 in 2023 to win their third AL Central title under Baldelli and their first series in the playoffs in 21 years, were in firm control of a wild-card spot down the stretch last season before tumbling out of contention with a 12-27 record over the last six weeks to land at 82-80.",
      "Factoring that finish into their extended funk this year, the Twins are 82-119 over their last 201 games for a .408 winning percentage. That includes a 13-game winning streak they produced earlier this season.",
      "Attendance has swooned at Target Field, with the Twins finishing with an 81-home game total of a little more than 1.7 million tickets sold, their lowest number in a non-pandemic season since 2000 when they played at the Metrodome and finished 69-93. Fans have mostly directed their disdain toward ownership, with deep frustration over cost-cutting that came after the 2023 breakthrough. The Pohlad family put the franchise up for sale last year, but decided last month to keep control and bring on two new investment groups for an infusion of cash to help pay down debt.",
      "The dizzying trade-deadline activity left Baldelli and his staff without much to work with down the stretch, though All-Star center fielder Byron Buxton was a bright spot in a breakthrough season for his health and rookie second baseman Luke Keaschall provided consistent production and a professional approach at the plate belying his inexperience.",

      "Baldelli was hired before the 2019 season to replace Hall of Famer Paul Molitor, with Falvey citing his adaptivity to the data-based direction of baseball strategy and his communication skill in distilling it to coaches and players and clearly setting expectations and preferences.",
      "Particularly in this modern age of analytics, there\u2019s plenty of mystery about just how much impact a manager in the dugout truly has on a baseball team\u2019s won-loss record, but the overall performance \u2014 even with the post-trade deadline roster depletion this year \u2014 and lack of life from the club lately suggested some type of staffing change would be warranted.",

      "Manager Bob Melvin was fired Monday after the club missed the playoffs for a fourth straight season, and only hours later beloved former Giants manager Bruce Bochy had become a potentially available free agent.",
      "Posey, San Francisco's President of Baseball Operations, announced the decision. He had shown his confidence in Melvin by exercising the veteran manager's contract option for the 2026 season on July 1.",

      "Now, another change.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not ideal but unfortunately we talked about it a lot what the standards are for the Giants and we have high standards,\u201d Posey said. \u201cAnd I hold myself to those same standards. I understand fully the position that I\u2019m in now. My job and the team\u2019s success is evaluated accordingly as well. You without a doubt hope that there can be consistency in these leadership positions. We\u2019ve got to get back to a place where we\u2019re getting in the playoffs, we\u2019re making runs in playoffs. That\u2019s what our fan base deserves, that\u2019s what the city deserves.\u201d",
      "As Posey begins finalizing his list of candidates, one familiar name immediately came up as a possibility: Bochy. He has wrapped up his three-year contract with Texas but Posey noted, \u201cI don\u2019t know what his status is yet so I can\u2019t speak on that.\u201d",
      "By later in the day, it was clear \u2014 Bochy had formally parted ways with the Rangers. Texas general manager Chris Young said in a video call when asked about the speed of the split that he was unaware of San Francisco's sudden vacancy until after his meeting with Bochy had concluded.",
      "Young said Bochy was offered an advisory role in the front office.",
      "\u201cHe never asked for an extension, it never came to that,\u201d Young said.",

      "Thomas Melchior shows up at soccer games wearing the jersey of the home team\u2019s fiercest rival \u2014 a move sure to rile the home fans \u2014 while holding a sign that says \u201clost a bet.\u201d",
      "He uses the attention to start a conversation about the dangers of sports betting, and posts video clips of the interactions on his social media accounts.",
      "The strategy can be risky \u2014 rival fans rarely mix at German soccer games and police go to great lengths to keep them apart to avoid trouble. Some of Melchior\u2019s clips show him getting confronted by aggressive fans who insult him, throw beer at him or demand that he take off his jersey.",
      "\u201cYes, it\u2019s dangerous, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for anyone,\u201d Melchior told The Associated Press on Sunday, before he unveiled his hidden Hertha Berlin jersey at a home game of local rival Union Berlin.",
      "The sign says he lost a bet, but Melchior lost so much more. A former bank teller, he was sentenced to 5\u00bd years in prison in 2019 for fraud and theft offenses against strangers and people he knew after losing more than 800,000 euros ($937,000 today) on gambling. He lost his job, friends and family, too, and felt completely alone. He thought about ending his life.",
      "Now he's working on righting his wrongs, and repaying his debts.",
      "\u201cWhen the handcuffs clicked, it was the first moment I felt free again since my first bet. That\u2019s when I felt I had survived gambling addiction,\u201d Melchior said. \u201cIn that moment, I decided I would try to repair all the damage. And I wanted to get out of prison with the best possible conditions so I could inform and warn people about gambling addiction. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here today.\u201d",
      "Melchior, who has quickly built up a large following on TikTok and Instagram, received a mostly positive response from fans on Sunday \u2014 his message had already reached many through social media and some fans stopped for selfies \u2014 but there were others who expressed surprise or amusement.",
      "\u201cPoor sod!\u201d some fans laughed as they kept walking. Others stopped to talk and to hear Melchior\u2019s story and his advice to \u201ckeep your finger away from sports betting.\u201d Some covered his Hertha shirt with Union stickers.",
      "Coincidentally, last week the German soccer players\u2019 union (VDV) called on the German soccer federation (DFB) to stop accepting sponsorship funds from sports betting providers and to do more to prevent gambling addiction.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable that the DFB proclaims \u2018supporting effective addiction prevention\u2019 as one of its goals in its statutes, while it simultaneously sells exorbitant amounts of advertising space to sports betting providers,\u201d VDV vice president Maik Franz, a former Bundesliga player, said in a statement.",

      "\u201cYou deserve it x1000,\u201d Mbappe graciously posted on social media.",
      "In second place was teenage sensation Lamine Yamal \u2014 a player of such prodigious talent that he is now the one predicted to dominate the Ballon d'Or. A new generation is threatening to usurp Mbappe before he's even established himself at the top.",
      "\u201cThe challenges do seem to be getting bigger for him to go to the top,\u201d author Luca Caioli told The Associated Press. Caioli co-wrote the book \u201cMbappe\u201d chronicling his rise from prodigy to superstar.",
      "He said the emergence of the 18-year-old Yamal places doubts over whether Mbappe would become a multiple Ballon d'Or winner.",
      "\u201cNow it could be very complicated because of the fascination of this young player of 18 years that broke all the records for (someone his) age,\u201d said Caioli. \u201cAlso the age starts to be interesting for Mbappe. He's not 19 years old like when he won the World Cup. It\u2019s changed.\u201d",
      "Yamal, who has already led Spain to a European Championship and Barcelona to the Spanish title in his nascent career, won the Kopa trophy for the best under-21 player for the second year running. But there were claims he deserved the top prize, which would have made him the youngest ever recipient of the Ballon d'Or - overtaking Brazil striker Ronaldo, who won it aged 21.",
      "La Liga president Javier Tebas said the forward was only overlooked because of his age. Yamal\u2019s father said his son was the \u201cbest player in the world by far.\u201d",
      "There was no such outrage in response to Mbappe missing out. Not even from his club, Real Madrid, which last year boycotted the ceremony when Vinicius Junior was beaten to the prize by Manchester City midfielder Rodri.",
      "Frankly, Mbappe was barely part of the conversation this year despite winning the Golden Shoe as the top scorer in Europe.",
      "But at the age of 26, Mbappe's levels are not dropping. The Golden Shoe was the first of his career and last month he moved past Thierry Henry's total of 51 goals for France. He is now just six short of overtaking Olivier Giroud as his country's all-time leading scorer.",
      "He was the first teenager since Brazil great Pele to score in a World Cup final when France won in 2018. And he followed that four years later by becoming only the second player to score a hat trick in the final when France lost on penalties against Argentina.",
      "He left Paris Saint-Germain as the club's all-time top scorer.",
      "Yet despite the comments by Tebas and Yamal\u2019s father, few could say Dembele was not a deserved winner of the Ballon d'Or as the star player of a PSG team that won the Champions League and the French league and Cup, scoring 32 goals.",
      "While it was a year of personal redemption for Dembele, whose career had stalled after a move to Barcelona in 2017, it also happened to come in the first season after Mbappe's years-long-trailed transfer from PSG to Madrid.",

The criteria includes individual and team performances, \u201cdecisive and impressive character\u201d and \u201cclass and fair play.\u201d",
      "It is, however, often weighted towards the best player in a team that wins the Champions League or a major international competition like the World Cup in any given year.",
      "Which is why Mbappe could consider himself unfortunate to miss out after winning the World Cup with France in 2018 when he placed fourth. The winner that year was Luka Modric, who was runner up in the World Cup with Croatia and won the Champions League with Madrid.",
      "\u201cI did everything I could, but not everything I could to win a Ballon d\u2019Or,\u201d Mbappe said at the time. \u201cIt shows me how much I still have to do to win this trophy or it would be too easy to get there and win it all at once.\u201d",
      "Mbappe's highest placing in the Ballon d'Or came in 2023 after his World Cup final hat trick. The winner that year was Messi, who led Argentina to victory at the Qatar tournament.",
      "The expectation that Mbappe could dominate the Ballon d'Or was based on the standards set by Messi and Ronaldo, who won it a combined 13 times. It was predicted that he and Man City striker Erling Haaland would develop a similar rivalry, but Yamal's emergence has changed that.",

      "Cale Makar has noticed major changes in college hockey since he left UMass for the NHL five years ago",
      "Cale Makar has difficulty recognizing the college hockey landscape in the wake of a seismic shift that has transformed the sport in the mere five years since he left UMass to join Colorado in the NHL.",
      "From the introduction of name, image and likeness money to the NCAA lifting its ban on Canadian Hockey League players in November, Makar was captivated by the sheer number of players committing to Division I programs this offseason. It seemed like a mass exodus culminating with Gavin McKenna \u2014 the NHL\u2019s prospective 2026 No. 1 draft pick \u2014 committing to Penn State.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a crazy world. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m kind of out of that now,\u201d Makar said. \u201cIt seems like a gong show.\u201d",
      "The path south is familiar for Canadian players like Makar. The two-time Norris Trophy winner as the league's top defenseman left his Calgary hometown to spend two years playing for the Minutemen and was voted college hockey\u2019s MVP in 2019.",
      "What\u2019s changed are the rules, leading to a transformational shift altering the dynamic between the CHL and NCAA in ways not yet entirely realized.",
      "\u201cI wish I had the answer to that,\u201d Washington Capitals assistant GM Ross Mahoney said. \u201cI guess it\u2019ll probably shake itself out in the next three or four years.\u201d",
      "What is clear is that players no longer have to choose before turning 16 whether to go to the CHL or maintain college eligibility in the United States Hockey League or go the Canadian Junior A route. They're now free to play in the CHL before deciding whether to commit to a U.S. college after high school.",
      "The influx of CHL talent should elevate college hockey to an even higher standard.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re witnessing a paradigm shift the size of which college hockey\u2019s never seen,\u201d said Frank Serratore, who's entering his 29th season as coach at Air Force. \u201cLike it\u2019s massive. I tell you what, DI hockey players have always been members of an exclusive club. And that club is about to become even more exclusive.\u201d",
      "Serratore projects CHL players adding depth and displacing players who were previously pegged as third- or fourth-liners.",
      "\u201cMany rosters are going to be unrecognizable from a year ago,\u201d he said. \u201cI've spoken to a lot of coaches who feel their fourth lines this year are going to be as good or better than their second lines.\u201d",
      "The floodgates have opened, with College Hockey Insider reporting nearly 325 CHL players committing to U.S. colleges for this season and beyond.",
      "In turn, the 61 teams making up the CHL umbrella \u2014 the Ontario, Western and Quebec Maritime leagues \u2014 suddenly have a new talent pool of USHL and Junior A prospects to draw from to fill their rosters in what has become a mass redistribution of talent across the continent.",
      "The changing landscape has opened a debate over whether the NCAA will eventually overtake the CHL as the primary feeder of talent to the NHL. Hockey East Conference Commissioner Steve Metcalf believes college hockey now has the edge.",
      "\u201cCurrently the NHL is made up of about one-third of players that come directly from college. That number is going to grow to two-thirds in no time at all,\u201d Metcalf said. \u201cAnd I haven\u2019t been able to find anyone that doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s the track we\u2019re on.\u201d",
      "The numbers were already shifting before the NCAA rule change announced last fall.",
      "Two of the past five No. 1 draft picks, San Jose\u2019s Macklin Celebrini and Buffalo\u2019s Owen Power, are Canadians who chose the USHL before being drafted out of college. Before that, Rick DiPietro in 2000 and Joe Murphy in 1986, were the only two other college hockey players to go No. 1.",

      "\u201cI think that there\u2019s actually a harmonious relationship that will inevitably develop between all the stakeholders,\u201d he said.",
      "The CHL provided data indicating of the 150 or so players committing to the NCAA this season, 87% were either skipping their 20-year-old \u201cover-age season\u201d or had already completed their eligibility. And 75% of all players making college commitments this season and beyond fall into the same category.",
      "Meantime, the CHL said nearly 250 players are joining their teams from the USHL and Junior A ranks.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Simmering political tensions between India and Pakistan have intensified on the cricket field with the India team refusing to accept the Asia Cup trophy from a senior Pakistani official, having already declined handshakes with their archrival for three consecutive matches.",
      "Tilak Varma\u2019s nerveless half-century helped India beat arch rivals Pakistan at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Sunday and claim its ninth Asia Cup \u2013 second in the T20 format.",
      "But it at the post-match presentation ceremony where tensions reached boiling point.",
      "The ceremony was first delayed for unclear reasons for over one-and-a-half hours. The Pakistan team, led by captain Salman Agha, then arrived late for the ceremony. However, there was a further delay as the Indian team refused to accept the trophy from Asian Cricket Council (ACC) chief Mohsin Naqvi, who is also the chief of Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and the Interior Minister of Pakistan.",
      "India\u2019s Twenty20 skipper Suryakumar Yadav claimed that his team was denied the chance to lift the 2025 Asia Cup trophy.",
      "\u201cThis is one thing which I have never seen since I started playing cricket, started following cricket \u2013 a champion team is denied a trophy, that too a hard earned one,\u201d said Yadav in the post-match media conference. \u201cI feel we deserved it. And I can\u2019t say anything more.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you tell me about trophies, mine are sitting in the dressing room, all 14 guys with me, the support staff \u2013 those are the real trophies throughout this journey in the Asia Cup.\u201d",
      "A statement on the ACC website had stated on Saturday that Naqvi would hand over the trophy to the Asia Cup winners. However, it is understood that the Indian team did not want to receive the trophy from him \u2013 in line with their refusal to shake hands with the Pakistan team in any of the three matches the two sides played during the tournament, both at the coin toss and at the end of the match.",
      "While the Indian team had refused to accept the trophy from Naqvi, he reportedly refused to step down from the presentation ceremony altogether. Before the ceremony began, an official also removed the Asia Cup trophy from the presentation podium. No explanation was provided from the ACC for this action.",
      "\u201cLadies and gentlemen, I have been informed by the ACC that the Indian cricket team will not be collecting their awards tonight. So that does conclude the post-match presentation,\u201d Simon Doull, former New Zealand cricketer and broadcaster, announced.",
      "This was after Tilak Varma and Abhishek Sharma had collected their individual awards \u2013 player of the match and tournament, respectively. India wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav also collected an award for his bowling performances through the tournament.",
      "All three received their awards from sponsor representatives, and did not acknowledge or shake hands with Naqvi on the presentation stage.",
      "The Pakistan team received its runners-up medals from Aminul Islam, the Bangladesh Cricket Board president, and the check from Naqvi.",
      "Eventually, the Indian team celebrated without the trophy or its individual winners\u2019 medals.",
      "\u201cWe have decided not to take the Asia Cup trophy from the ACC chairman, who happens to be one of the main leaders of Pakistan,\u201d BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia told Indian news media outlet, ANI. \u201cBut that does not mean that the gentleman will take away the trophy with him, along with the medals. So it is very unfortunate and we hope that the trophy and the medals will be returned to India as soon as possible.",
      "\u201cThere is an ICC conference in November in Dubai. In the next conference, we are going to launch a very serious and very strong protest against the act of the ACC chairperson.\u201d",

      "The Pakistan skipper believed the Indian team not only disrespected Pakistan players by not shaking hands, but they disrespected cricket.",
      "\u201cGood teams don\u2019t do what they did today (by refusing to accept the trophy from Naqvi),\u201d Agha said. \u201cWe went to pose with the trophy on our own because we wanted to fulfil our obligations.

      "More online platforms are giving secondhand shopping a digital upgrade, rolling out features like livestream shopping and AI-powered search to make thrifting faster and more exciting.",
      "Although choosing secondhand over new is often the more sustainable option, experts say it\u2019s not a license to overconsume. They warn that resale has its limits, since buying more than you need still fuels waste, and shopping online can add emissions from servers and shipping, thrifted or not.",
      "Here's how industry experts and fashion-forward shoppers shop secondhand sustainably \u2014 and how to find quality pieces that last while looking cool, too.",
      "At eBay\u2019s secondhand runway shows in New York and London, models wore pre-loved designer pieces that guests could shop live. Secondhand items like those make up 40% of the company's sales, said Alexis Hoopes, eBay\u2019s vice president of fashion.",
      "\u201cOne of our big priorities is making secondhand just as good as shopping in the primary market,\" she said.",
      "ThredUp and The RealReal have reported record sales this year, signaling that the online resale market is growing quickly. Live-auction apps like Whatnot are giving shoppers more platforms to bid on used clothing.",
      "Shoppers navigating growing online options with an eye toward sustainability can still end up buying more than they need.",
      "\u201cPeople who buy secondhand clothing were found to buy more clothing than people who don\u2019t,\u201d said Meital Peleg Mizrachi, a postdoctoral fellow at Yale University who researches textile waste. \u201cNot only that, they tend to get rid of those clothes faster than other consumers. So they\u2019re ending up creating more textile waste because they\u2019re buying more and using that clothing for a shorter period of time.\u201d",
      "Less than 20% of clothing donations to charities are resold in their stores, according to the Council for Textile Recycling. The rest is downcycled, exported \u2014 often to countries in the Global South \u2014 or ultimately discarded in landfills.",
      "Online resale also generates emissions from shipping and packaging, and running massive e-commerce platforms consumes energy, all factors that need to be considered, said Alana James, a fashion professor at Northumbria University. But all of that pales in comparison to the environmental impact of producing a new garment, she said.",
      "Experts say truly sustainable fashion requires breaking away from the fast-fashion mindset \u2014 the constant pressure to \u201cbuy now\u201d and the manufactured sense of scarcity that fuels overconsumption.",
      "\u201cHaul\u201d culture \u2014 the social media trend of showing off massive shopping sprees \u2014 shows overconsumption in a new way, said Katrina Caspelich, communications director for Remake, an advocacy group for human rights and climate justice in fashion.",
      "\u201cResponsible secondhand shopping means choosing pieces you\u2019ll truly wear, investing in quality and resisting the pull of endless trend cycles,\" she said.",
      "It can be difficult to determine quality when shopping online, but asking the seller about the garment\u2019s composition can help, said Wisdom Kaye, a menswear content creator.",
      "Natural fabrics are a good place to start, said Caspelich.",
      "\u201cLook for silk, cotton, bamboo \u2014 things that breathe and last \u2014 versus synthetics like polyester or nylon,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Scientists warn that &ldquo;flying rivers&rdquo; &mdash; invisible streams of moisture that carry rain from the Atlantic Ocean westward across the Amazon &mdash; are weakening as deforestation and climate change advance",
    "story": [
      "Scientists warn that \u201cflying rivers\u201d \u2014 invisible streams of moisture that carry rain from the Atlantic Ocean westward across the Amazon \u2014 are weakening as deforestation and climate change advance",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Droughts have withered crops in Peru, fires have scorched the Amazon and hydroelectric dams in Ecuador have struggled to keep the lights on as rivers dry up. Scientists say the cause may lie high above the rainforest, where invisible \u201cflying rivers\u201d carry rain from the Atlantic Ocean across South America.",
      "New analysis warns that relentless deforestation is disrupting that water flow and suggests that continuing tree loss will worsen droughts in the southwestern Amazon and could eventually trigger those regions to shift from rainforest to drier savanna \u2014 grassland with far fewer trees.",
      "\u201cThese are the forces that actually create and sustain the Amazon rainforest,\u201d said Matt Finer, a senior researcher with Amazon Conservation\u2019s Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project (MAAP), which tracks deforestation and climate threats across the basin and carried out the analysis.",
      "\u201cIf you break that pump by cutting down too much forest, the rains stop reaching where they need to go.\u201d",
      "Most of the Amazon\u2019s rainfall starts over the Atlantic Ocean. Moist air is pushed inland by steady winds that blow west along the equator, known as the trade winds. The forest then acts like a pump, effectively relaying the water thousands of miles westward as the trees absorb water, then release it back into the air.",
      "Brazilian climate scientist Carlos Nobre was among the early researchers who calculated how much of the water vapor from the Atlantic would move through and eventually out of the Amazon basin. He and colleagues coined the \u201cflying rivers\u201d term at a 2006 scientific meeting, and interest grew as scientists warned that a weakening of the rivers could push the Amazon into a tipping point where rainforest would turn to savanna.",
      "That's important because the Amazon rainforest is a vast storehouse for the carbon dioxide that largely drives the world's warming. Such a shift would devastate wildlife and Indigenous communities and threaten farming, water supplies and weather stability far beyond the region.",
      "The analysis by Finer's group found that southern Peru and northern Bolivia are especially vulnerable. During the dry season, flying rivers sweep across southern Brazil before reaching the Andes \u2014 precisely where deforestation is most intense. The loss of trees means less water vapor is carried westward, raising the risk of drought in iconic protected areas such as Peru\u2019s Manu National Park.",
      "\u201cPeru can do everything right to protect a place like Manu,\u201d Finer said. \u201cBut if deforestation keeps cutting into the pump in Brazil, the rains that sustain it may never arrive.\u201d",
      "Nobre said as much as 50% of rainfall in the western Amazon near the Andes depends on the flying rivers.",
      "Corine Vriesendorp, Amazon Conservation\u2019s director of science based in Cusco, Peru, said the changes are already visible.",
      "\u201cThe last two years have brought the driest conditions the Amazon has ever seen,\u201d Vriesendorp said. \u201cEcological calendars that Indigenous communities use \u2014 when to plant, when to fish, when animals reproduce \u2014 are increasingly out of sync. Having less and more unpredictable rain will have an even bigger impact on their lives than climate change is already having.\u201d",
      "Farmers face failed harvests, Indigenous families struggle with disrupted fishing and hunting seasons and cities that rely on hydroelectric power see outages as the rivers that provide the power dry up.",
      "MAAP researchers found that rainfall patterns depend on when and where the flying rivers cross the basin. In the wet season, their northern route flows mostly over intact forests in Guyana, Suriname and northern Brazil, keeping the system strong.",

      "But in the dry season \u2014 when forests are already stressed by heat \u2014 the aerial rivers cut across southern Brazil, where deforestation fronts spread along highways and farms and there simply are fewer trees to help move the moisture along.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s during the dry months, when the forest most needs water, that the flying rivers are most disrupted,\u201d Finer said.",
      "Finer pointed to roads that can accelerate deforestation, noting that the controversial BR-319 highway in Brazil \u2014 a project to pave a road through one of the last intact parts of the southern Amazon \u2014 could create an entirely new deforestation front.",
      "For years, scientists have warned about the Amazon tipping toward savannah. Finer said the new study complicates that picture.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a single, all-at-once collapse,\u201d he said. \u201cCertain areas, like the southwest Amazon, are more vulnerable and will feel the impacts first. And we\u2019re already seeing early signs of rainfall reduction downwind of deforested areas.\u201d",
      "Nobre said the risks are stark. Amazon forests have already lost about 17% of their cover, mostly to cattle and soy. Those ecosystems recycle far less water.",
      "\u201cThe dry season is now five weeks longer than it was 45 years ago, with 20 to 30% less rainfall,\u201d he said. \u201cIf deforestation exceeds 20 to 25% and warming reaches 2 degrees Celsius, there\u2019s no way to prevent the Amazon from reaching the tipping point.\u201d",
      "Protecting intact forests, supporting Indigenous land rights and restoring deforested areas are the clearest paths forward, researchers say.",
      "\u201cTo avoid collapse we need zero deforestation, degradation and fires \u2014 immediately,\u201d Nobre said. \u201cAnd we must begin large-scale forest restoration, not less than half a million square kilometers. If we do that, and keep global warming below 2 degrees, we can still save the Amazon.\u201d",
      "Finer said governments should consider new conservation categories specifically designed to protect flying rivers \u2014 safeguarding not just land but the atmospheric flows that make the rainforest possible.",
      "For Vriesendorp, that means regional cooperation. She praised Peru for creating vast parks and Indigenous reserves in the southeast, including Manu National Park. But, she said, \u201cthis can\u2019t be solved by one country alone. Peru depends on Brazil, and Brazil depends on its neighbors. We need basin-wide solutions.\u201d",

      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom has signed into law legislation aiming to increase transparency and prevent AI models from being used to cause catastrophic harms",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday signed a law that aims to prevent people from using powerful artificial intelligence models for potentially catastrophic activities like building a bioweapon or shutting down a bank system.",
      "The move comes as Newsom touted California as a leader in AI regulation and criticized the inaction at the federal level in a recent conversation with former President Bill Clinton. The new law will establish some of the first-in-the-nation regulations on large-scale AI models without hurting the state's homegrown industry, Newsom said. Many of the world's top AI companies are located in California and will have to follow the requirements.",
      "\u201cCalifornia has proven that we can establish regulations to protect our communities while also ensuring that the growing AI industry continues to thrive. This legislation strikes that balance,\" Newsom said in a statement.",
      "The legislation requires AI companies to implement and disclose publicly safety protocols to prevent their most advanced models from being used to cause major harm. The rules are designed to cover AI systems if they meet a \u201cfrontier\u201d threshold that signals they run on a huge amount of computing power.",
      "Such thresholds are based on how many calculations the computers are performing. Those who crafted the regulations have acknowledged the numerical thresholds are an imperfect starting point to distinguish today\u2019s highest-performing generative AI systems from the next generation that could be even more powerful. The existing systems are largely made by California-based companies like Anthropic, Google, Meta Platforms and OpenAI.",
      "The legislation defines a catastrophic risk as something that would cause at least $1 billion in damage or more than 50 injuries or deaths. It's designed to guard against AI being used for activities that could cause mass disruption, such as hacking into a power grid.",
      "Companies also have to report to the state any critical safety incidents within 15 days. The law creates whistleblower protections for AI workers and establishes a public cloud for researchers. It includes a fine of $1 million per violation.",
      "It drew opposition from some tech companies, which argued that AI legislation should be done at the federal level. But Anthropic said the regulations are \u201cpractical safeguards\u201d that make official the safety practices many companies are already doing voluntarily.",
      "\"While federal standards remain essential to avoid a patchwork of state regulations, California has created a strong framework that balances public safety with continued innovation,\u201d Jack Clark, co-founder and head of policy at Anthropic, said in a statement.",
      "The signing comes after Newsom last year vetoed a broader version of the legislation, siding with tech companies that said the requirements were too rigid and would have hampered innovation. Newsom instead asked a group of several industry experts, including AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li, to develop recommendations on guardrails around powerful AI models.",
      "The new law incorporates recommendations and feedback from Newsom\u2019s group of AI experts and the industry, supporters said. The legislation also doesn't put the same level of reporting requirements on startups to avoid hurting innovation, said state Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco, the bill's author.",

      "In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission has even opened an inquiry into several tech companies about the potential harms to children and teenagers who use their AI chatbots as companions.",
      "In a blog post posted Monday, OpenAI outlined the new controls for parents. Here is a breakdown:",
      "The parental controls will be available to all users, but both parents and teens will need their own accounts to take advantage of them.",
      "To get started, a parent or guardian needs to send an email or text message to invite a teen to connect their accounts. Or a teenager can send an invite to a parent. Users can send a request by going into the settings menu and then to the \"Parental controls\" section.",
      "Teens can unlink their accounts at any time, but parents will be notified if they do.",
      "Once the accounts are linked, the teen account will get some built-in protections, OpenAI said.",
      "Teen accounts will \u201cautomatically get additional content protections, including reduced graphic content, viral challenges, sexual, romantic or violent role-play, and extreme beauty ideals, to help keep their experience age-appropriate,\u201d the company said.",
      "Parents can choose to turn these filters off, but teen users don't have the option.",
      "OpenAI warns that such guardrails are \u201cnot foolproof and can be bypassed if someone is intentionally trying to get around them.\u201d It advised parents to talk with their children about \u201chealthy AI use.\u201d",

      "For example, does your teen stay up way past bedtime to use ChatGPT? Parents can set a quiet time when the chatbot can't be used.",
      "Other settings include turning off the AI's memory so conversations can't be saved and won't be used in future responses; turning off the ability to generate or edit images; turning off voice mode; and opting out of having chats used to train ChatGPT's AI models.",
      "OpenAI is also being more proactive when it comes to letting parents know that their child might be in distress.",
      "It's setting up a new notification system to inform them when something might be \u201cseriously wrong\u201d and a teen user might be thinking about harming themselves.",
      "A small team of specialists will review the situation and, in the rare case that there are \u201csigns of acute distress,\u201d they'll notify parents by email, text message and push alert on their phone \u2014 unless the parent has opted out.",
      "OpenAI said it will protect the teen's privacy by only sharing the information needed for parents or emergency responders to provide help.",
      "\u201cNo system is perfect, and we know we might sometimes raise an alarm when there isn\u2019t real danger, but we think it\u2019s better to act and alert a parent so they can step in than to stay silent,\u201d the company said.",

      "President Donald Trump and his administration have embraced artificial intelligence-generated images, crafting a new official portrait of him",
      "WASHINGTON -- Here he is, depicted at six months in office, chiseled and brawny, as mighty as the very nation. Here he is as a Star Wars Jedi wielding a patriot-red lightsaber, rescuing our galaxy from the forces of evil. Here he is taking over Gaza, transforming the strip into a luxury resort complete with a golden effigy of himself.",
      "You can be anything, perhaps you were told growing up. Doctor. Astronaut. Maybe, one day, the president. But even the chief executive of the United States, the free world\u2019s leader, frames himself as something more epic \u2014 as someone not entirely himself.",
      "On the social media accounts of Donald Trump and his second-term administration, a new official image of the president is emerging bit by bit: one generated artificially.",
      "A sign of the times, certainly \u2014 when the appeal of reimagining yourself with artificial intelligence has trickled up from us everyday citizens. Bored with your selfies? Join a viral trend: There\u2019s an image generator or a chatbot that can turn you into a Renaissance-style painting, a Studio Ghibli character or an action figure with box art and accessories.",
      "Artificial imagery isn\u2019t new for Trump, an early target of AI-generated simulacra who later exploited the technology during his 2024 campaign for the presidency. \u201cIt works both ways,\u201d the Republican president said of AI-generated content at a news conference earlier this month. \u201cIf something happens that\u2019s really bad, maybe I\u2019ll have to just blame AI.\u201d",
      "The AI images of Trump posted by him and his team opt for the alternative \u2014 not deceptive but self-evident in their fictitiousness. Pope Francis dies, and Trump jokes to reporters that he\u2019d like to be pope. A week later, he is, but in an AI-generated image that he posts, reposted by the White House. Trump likens himself to a king in a Truth Social post in February, and AI makes him one in an X post by the White House less than an hour later.",
      "The artifice arrives in Trump\u2019s usual style \u2014 brassy, unabashed, attention-grabbing \u2014 and squares with his social media team\u2019s heavy meme posting, which it has promised to continue. The administration\u2019s official social media accounts have grown by more than 16 million new followers across platforms since Inauguration Day, a White House official told NBC News.",
      "The White House recognizes the appeal. In July, it posted to its X account: \u201cNowhere in the Constitution does it say we can\u2019t post banger memes.\u201d Attached to the post, a photo of a sign on the White House lawn parodying the naysayers: \u201coMg, diD tHe wHiTE hOuSE reALLy PosT tHis?\u201d",
      "Behind the commander in chief\u2019s desire to craft an AI self \u2014 not itself uncommon \u2014 an infantry of official communications channels stands at his ready. And we, the people, can\u2019t help but tune in.",
      "Like so much on the internet these days, Trump\u2019s AI portraits are primed for people to react, says Evan Cornog, a political historian and author of \u201cThe Power and the Story: How the Crafted Presidential Narrative Has Determined Political Success from George Washington to George W. Bush.\u201d",
      "\u201cBy the time you\u2019ve seen it, you\u2019ve understood it. And that\u2019s, of course, the efficacy,\u201d Cornog said. \u201cIt requires no effort, either for the person generating it, but particularly for the person consuming it.\u201d",
      "The expressive power of political imagery, regardless of the truth of its message, has long been understood by politicians and their detractors.",
      "President William Henry Harrison\u2019s log cabin and hard cider campaign symbols, representing him as a \u201cman of the people,\u201d helped him win the election of 1840. Thirty years later, political cartoonist Thomas Nast would turn public opinion against William Marcy \u201cBoss\u201d Tweed with his scathing portrayals of the politician, whom he depicted satirically overweight from greed. \u201cLet\u2019s stop those damned pictures!\u201d Tweed once said, or so the story goes.",
      "The decades since witnessed the birth of photo, film, TV, the internet, computer printers, image-editing software and digital screens that shrank until they could fit in our pockets, making it increasingly easy to create and disseminate \u2014 and manipulate \u2014 imagery.",
      "By contrast, today\u2019s generative AI technology offers greater realism, functionality and accessibility to content creation than ever before, says AI expert Henry Ajder. Not to mention, of course, a capacity for endless automated possibility.",
      "Past presidents \u201chad to actually have fought in a war to run as a war hero,\u201d Cornog says. Now, they can just generate an image of themselves as one. On a horse \u2014 or no, a battlefield. With an American flag waving behind him and an eagle soaring.",

      "But it can just as easily fulfill an inverse desire: to depict or reinforce a subjective concept of reality.",
      "\u201cQuite a lot of people are sharing AI-generated content, which is clearly fake but is almost seen as a revelatory kind of representation of someone,\u201d Ajder said. This content feeds a mentality that mutters, \u201cWe all know they\u2019re really like this.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd so, even if people know it\u2019s fake,\u201d Ajder said, \u201cthey still see it as kind of reflecting and satisfying a kind of truth \u2014 their truth about what the world is like.\u201d",
      "The lack of subtlety in Trump\u2019s AI images of himself helps explain their consistent virality.",
      "Commenters can be found lamenting the demise of presidential decorum (\u201cI never thought I\u2019d see the day when the White House is just a joke. This is so embarrassing.\u201d) or relishing those very reactions (\u201cWatching the left explode over this has been a treat.\u201d).",
      "Other responses, even from the president\u2019s base, remain unconvinced (as one X user griped under the White House post of Trump as pope: \u201cI voted for you, but this is weird and creepy. More mass deportations and less of whatever this is.\u201d).",
      "But that is tradition for Trump, who finds no trouble cashing the currency of our attention economy: Whether you cracked a smile or clutched your pearls, he still made you look.",
      "\u201cIn his first administration, he used Twitter in a way no president had,\u201d said Martha Joynt Kumar, director of the White House Transition Project, an organization that facilitates the transition between presidents. \u201cWhat they do in this administration is taking it further, as you\u2019ve had an increase in what can be done online.\u201d Or, as one Reddit user referred to the president: \u201cTroll in Chief.\u201d",
      "Does Trump really think he should be pope? Does the White House really think him a king? Accuracy isn\u2019t the point, not for a man who frequently arbitrates what counts as truth. Trump's use of AI sticks to a familiar recipe for bait: crude comedy sprinkled with wishful thinking.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Trump said in May, when asked whether the AI-generated post of him as pope diminished the substance of the official White House account.",

      "As mental health chatbots driven by artificial intelligence proliferate, a small number of states are trying to regulate them",
      "In the absence of stronger federal regulation, some states have begun regulating apps that offer AI \u201ctherapy\u201d as more people turn to artificial intelligence for mental health advice.",
      "But the laws, all passed this year, don't fully address the fast-changing landscape of AI software development. And app developers, policymakers and mental health advocates say the resulting patchwork of state laws isn't enough to protect users or hold the creators of harmful technology accountable.",
      "\u201cThe reality is millions of people are using these tools and they\u2019re not going back,\u201d said Karin Andrea Stephan, CEO and co-founder of the mental health chatbot app Earkick.",
      "___",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE \u2014 This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org.",
      "___",
      "The state laws take different approaches. Illinois and Nevada have banned the use of AI to treat mental health. Utah placed certain limits on therapy chatbots, including requiring them to protect users\u2019 health information and to clearly disclose that the chatbot isn\u2019t human. Pennsylvania, New Jersey and California are also considering ways to regulate AI therapy.",
      "The impact on users varies. Some apps have blocked access in states with bans. Others say they're making no changes as they wait for more legal clarity.",
      "And many of the laws don't cover generic chatbots like ChatGPT, which are not explicitly marketed for therapy but are used by an untold number of people for it. Those bots have attracted lawsuits in horrific instances where users lost their grip on reality or took their own lives after interacting with them.",
      "Vaile Wright, who oversees health care innovation at the American Psychological Association, agreed that the apps could fill a need, noting a nationwide shortage of mental health providers, high costs for care and uneven access for insured patients.",
      "Mental health chatbots that are rooted in science, created with expert input and monitored by humans could change the landscape, Wright said.",
      "\u201cThis could be something that helps people before they get to crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what\u2019s on the commercial market currently.\u201d",
      "That's why federal regulation and oversight is needed, she said.",
      "Earlier this month, the Federal Trade Commission announced it was opening inquiries into seven AI chatbot companies \u2014 including the parent companies of Instagram and Facebook, Google, ChatGPT, Grok (the chatbot on X), Character.AI and Snapchat \u2014 on how they \"measure, test and monitor potentially negative impacts of this technology on children and teens.\u201d And the Food and Drug Administration is convening an advisory committee Nov. 6 to review generative AI-enabled mental health devices.",
      "Federal agencies could consider restrictions on how chatbots are marketed, limit addictive practices, require disclosures to users that they are not medical providers, require companies to track and report suicidal thoughts, and offer legal protections for people who report bad practices by companies, Wright said.",
      "From \"companion apps\u201d to \u201cAI therapists\u201d to \u201cmental wellness\u201d apps, AI\u2019s use in mental health care is varied and hard to define, let alone write laws around.",
      "That has led to different regulatory approaches. Some states, for example, take aim at companion apps that are designed just for friendship, but don't wade into mental health care. The laws in Illinois and Nevada ban products that claim to provide mental health treatment outright, threatening fines up to $10,000 in Illinois and $15,000 in Nevada.",
      "But even a single app can be tough to categorize.",
      "Earkick's Stephan said there is still a lot that is \u201cvery muddy\u201d about Illinois' law, for example, and the company has not limited access there.",
      "Stephan and her team initially held off calling their chatbot, which looks like a cartoon panda, a therapist. But when users began using the word in reviews, they embraced the terminology so the app would show up in searches.",
      "Last week, they backed off using therapy and medical terms again. Earkick\u2019s website described its chatbot as \u201cYour empathetic AI counselor, equipped to support your mental health journey,\u201d but now it\u2019s a \u201cchatbot for self care.\u201d",

      "The study found users rated Therabot similar to a therapist and had meaningfully lower symptoms after eight weeks compared with people who didn't use it. Every interaction was monitored by a human who intervened if the chatbot\u2019s response was harmful or not evidence-based.",
      "Nicholas Jacobson, a clinical psychologist whose lab is leading the research, said the results showed early promise but that larger studies are needed to demonstrate whether Therabot works for large numbers of people.",
      "\u201cThe space is so dramatically new that I think the field needs to proceed with much greater caution that is happening right now,\u201d he said.",
      "Many AI apps are optimized for engagement and are built to support everything users say, rather than challenging peoples\u2019 thoughts the way therapists do. Many walk the line of companionship and therapy, blurring intimacy boundaries therapists ethically would not.",
      "Therabot\u2019s team sought to avoid those issues.",
      "The app is still in testing and not widely available. But Jacobson worries about what strict bans will mean for developers taking a careful approach. He noted Illinois had no clear pathway to provide evidence that an app is safe and effective.",
      "\u201cThey want to protect folks, but the traditional system right now is really failing folks,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, trying to stick with the status quo is really not the thing to do.\u201d",

      "K\u0101rearea, the Indigenous M\u0101ori name for the New Zealand falcon, was crowned Bird of the Year on Monday. But the annual poll, run by conservation group Forest & Bird, is no ordinary online vote.",
      "The fiercely fought election sees volunteer (human) campaign managers apply to stump for their favorite bird. Feathers fly as avian enthusiasts seek to sway the public through meme battles, trash-talking poster campaigns and dance routines performed in bird costumes.",
      "\u201cBird of the Year has grown from a simple email poll in 2005 to a hotly contested cultural moment,\u201d said Forest & Bird Chief Executive Nicola Toki. \u201cBehind the memes and mayhem is a serious message.\u201d",
      "The contest draws attention to New Zealand\u2019s native bird species, with 80% designated as being in trouble to some degree. But it attracts passionate fandom because New Zealanders are bird-obsessed.",
      "In a country with no native land mammals except for two species of bat, birds reign supreme. They appear in art, on jewelry, in schoolchildren\u2019s songs, and in the name New Zealanders are known by abroad, \u201ckiwis.\u201d",
      "Beloved birds include alpine parrots that harass tourists and pigeons which get so drunk on berries that they sometimes fall out of trees.",
      "\u201cThis is not a land of lions, tigers and bears,\u201d said Toki. \u201cThe birds here are weird and wonderful and not what you would expect to see perhaps in other countries.\u201d",
      "The first contest two decades ago attracted fewer than 900 votes. More than 75,000 people in the country of 5 million cast ballots this year.",
      "It was the highest-ever voter turnout apart from an episode when Last Week Tonight host John Oliver volunteered as a campaign manager in 2023, prompting mostly joking accusations from New Zealanders of American interference. Perhaps inevitably, Oliver\u2019s bird, the p\u016bteketeke or Australasian crested grebe, won in a 290,000-vote landslide.",
      "Other controversies have struck the poll. In 2021, there was mild uproar when a bat won the title, despite not being a bird.",
      "The vote was ruffled by a foreign influence scandal in 2018 when self-styled comedians in Australia cast hundreds of fraudulent votes for a bird that shares its name with an Antipodean slang term for sex. Voters must now verify the email addresses used to cast their votes.",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Private investment firms that are helping finance America\u2019s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers \u2014 and the servers that power AI.",
      "Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.",
      "\u201cThe reason is very simple: because there\u2019s a lot of money to be made,\u201d said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.",
      "Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, Brown said.",
      "BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is \u201cat the beginning of a golden age.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe believe that there\u2019s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy\" and energy, Fink said.",
      "In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.",
      "Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.",
      "However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that's a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.",
      "Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.",
      "Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.",
      "Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.",
      "Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.",
      "\u201cIt's no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don\u2019t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,\u201d said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.",
      "The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech\u2019s data centers.",
      "Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.",

      "That's because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.",
      "That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.",
      "The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don\u2019t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.",
      "Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.",
      "On the other side are the state attorney general\u2019s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power's electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.",
      "In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock's ownership, Minnesota Power's operations, strategy and values wouldn't change and that it doesn't expect the buyout price \u2014 $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium \u2014 to affect electric rates.",
      "In essence, Allete \u2014 which solicited bids for a buyout \u2014 argues that BlackRock's ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota\u2019s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.",
      "Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.",
      "However, opponents say Allete's suggestion that it'll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is \u201cwell positioned\u201d to meet its financing needs.",
      "It hasn't been smooth sledding for BlackRock.",
      "In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group's \u201cintent to do what private equity is expected to do \u2013 pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.\u201d",
      "In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie's concerns.",
      "They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power's parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.",
      "\u201cFor the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,\u201d the staff wrote. \u201cFor the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity \u2018wins\u2019 and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses \u2013 it is a lose-lose.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Rep. John Moolenaar has requested an urgent briefing from the White House after Trump supported a deal giving Americans a majority stake in TikTok",
      "WASHINGTON -- The chairman of a House committee that pushed for the law demanding TikTok be spun off from its Chinese owners has requested an urgent briefing from the White House, one day after Trump signed an executive order supporting a proposed deal that would put the popular social video platform under U.S. ownership.",
      "In a statement released Friday, Rep. John Moolenaar, the chairman of the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, praised the proposed deal as \"an important step\u201d in transitioning ownership of the TikTok platform to American hands but he emphasized that \u201cdivestment was not the law's only requirement.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe law also set firm guardrails that prohibit cooperation between ByteDance and any prospective TikTok successor on the all-important recommendation algorithm, as well as preclude operational ties between the new entity and ByteDance,\u201d Moolenaar said.",
      "The Michigan Republican's statement marks the first congressional effort to conduct oversight into the negotiations over TikTok, coming nearly two weeks after Chinese and American officials met in Spain to discuss a framework divestment deal for TikTok. Trump on Thursday signed an executive order providing support for the deal, and said Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to move forward with negotiations.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to an inquiry from the Associated Press regarding the urgent briefing.",
      "Much is still unknown about the actual deal in the works, but the new U.S. venture would license the famed ByteDance-owned algorithm that currently keeps TikTok users engaged. U.S. tech giant Oracle, a confirmed partner in the U.S. investment consortium that would own TikTok, would audit the copy of the algorithm and monitor it for security purposes.",
      "Vice President JD Vance on Thursday assured the public that the deal would not only keep TikTok operating but also protect Americans' data privacy as required by law. Moolenaar on Friday said he would like to know more.",
      "While algorithms are valuable assets, the real value of TikTok is its users, which is likely why the consortium won\u2019t just start from scratch to build a new app, said computer scientist Bart Knijnenburg, an associate professor at Clemson University who has studied how recommendation systems steer people to online content.",
      "Knijnenburg said all algorithms are biased in some way and if the administration is serious about retraining the TikTok algorithm to avoid Chinese influence, it should push for \u201cradical openness\u201d in TikTok\u2019s mechanics so that users have a window into how bias might be influencing their feeds.",
      "More than politics, Knijnenburg said the biggest problem with TikTok\u2019s algorithm is that it\u2019s geared toward addictive engagement and overuse.",
      "\u201cMoving it to the U.S. is not going to magically solve these types of problems,\u201d he said. \u201cAny company might put undue influence on these applications and from a business perspective, the best way to engage users is to make them addicted to watching these videos, which is not a good idea.\u201d",
      "Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the Washington-based think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies, doubts that the deal, as revealed so far, complies with the law.",
      "\u201cThe law is clear: divestiture means severance, not supervision,\u201d Singleton said. \u201cA board seat for ByteDance or any continued role in maintaining the algorithm would flout Congress\u2019s mandate.\"",
      "Though the details have yet to be finalized, the U.S. investment group\u2019s controlling stake in the new venture would be around 80%. While ByteDance is expected to have a stake in the new venture, it would be less than 20% \u2014 a portion of the ownership reserved for foreign investors. The board running the new platform would be controlled by U.S. investors. ByteDance will be represented by one person on the board, but that individual will be excluded from any security-related matters.",

      "Singleton argues that a board foothold by ByteDance is not merely symbolic. \u201cByteDance\u2019s reported role as the largest single shareholder in a restructured TikTok U.S. venture, combined with a board seat, ensures continuing Chinese influence over the app,\u201d he said. \u201cPlainly put, ByteDance on the board means Beijing in the building.\u201d",
      "Vance said he expects the new U.S.-based TikTok to be valued at about $14 billion, describing it as a \u201cgood deal\u201d for investors who must ultimately decide \u201cwhat they want to invest in and what they think is the proper value.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s a \u201csurprisingly low\u201d valuation, said Daniel Keum, a management professor at Columbia University\u2019s business school.",
      "Keum said it\u2019s possible that \u201cpolitics overrode the business case\u201d or that the licensing structure, which hasn\u2019t yet been disclosed, could have been designed with high fees or profit-sharing that depressed the value of TikTok\u2019s app in the U.S.",
      "Keum said TikTok had an early edge in attracting youth to its innovative video-sharing format, but its competitiveness has \u201cfundamentally eroded\u201d as social media creators and influencers increasingly post their videos on many different apps.",
      "As TikTok\u2019s popularity soared among young Americans in the past several years, U.S. lawmakers grew concerned that Beijing \u2014 viewed by many on the Capitol Hill as the biggest geopolitical rival to the U.S. \u2014 could use the platform to influence public discourse in the United States.",
      "\u201cByteDance has shown time and again that it is a bad actor, and the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s ultimate goal is to see America divided and weakened,\u201d Moolenaar said in his statement. \u201cThat is why, on an overwhelming bipartisan basis, Congress required ByteDance to divest control of TikTok.\u201d",
      "President Joe Biden signed legislation passed by Congress last year that would ban TikTok unless ByteDance sold its U.S. assets to an American company by early this year. The U.S. Supreme Court in January unanimously upheld the TikTok law.",
      "Trump, after he returned to the White House, has repeatedly signed orders that have allowed TikTok to keep operating in the U.S. as his administration tries to reach an agreement for the sale of the company.",
      "On Friday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry didn't provide any new information but repeated China's position on TikTok.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese government respects the will of enterprises and welcomes them to conduct sound commercial negotiations based on market rules, reaching solutions that comply with Chinese laws and regulations and achieve a balanced outcome of interests,\u201d said Guo Jiakun, a ministry spokesperson. \"We hope the U.S. will provide an open, fair, and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese enterprises investing in the United States.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The president echoed Hegseth's sentiments in a long-winded speech.",
      "In a speech Tuesday morning before an auditorium packed with several hundred of the nation's most seasoned military commanders, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called for an end to \"woke\" culture in the military and railed against a litany of complaints such as diversity and probes into hazing.",
      "\"The era of politically correct, overly sensitive, don't-hurt-anyone's-feelings leadership ends right now,\" Hegseth said at the gathering at a Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia -- a secure site an hour south of the nation's capital.",
      "Hegseth called for \"no more division, distraction or gender delusions\" in an extraordinarily blunt speech on the importance of the \"warrior ethos,\" a term he uses to describe the spirit that makes combat units effective.",
      "\"We must be prepared,\" he said. \"Either we're ready to win or we are not.\"",
      "Hegseth -- who served as an infantry officer in the U.S. Army National Guard and was deployed to Guantanamo Bay, Iraq and Afghanistan -- issued new directives that will raise physical standards for everyone in uniform to a \"male level,\" toughen grooming standards, lift restrictions on rules of engagement, do away with racial quotas, and end restrictions on hazing for boot camp recruits.",
      "He demanded no more \"fat generals,\" saying all service members would need to meet fitness tests and grooming standards.",
      "\"No more beardos,\" he said. \"The era of unacceptable appearance is over.\"",
      "\"Simply put, if you do not meet the male level physical standards for combat positions, cannot pass a PT test or don't want to shave and look professional, it's time for a new position or a new profession.\"",
      "He said he is also \"overhauling\" the DOD's Inspector General's Office that is investigating him for creating a culture of \"walking on eggshells\" that he said \"has been weaponized, putting complainers, ideologues and poor performers in the driver's seat.\"",
      "\"Foolish and reckless political leaders set the wrong compass heading and we lost our way. We became the 'Woke Department,' but not anymore,\" he said.",
      "He justified the firing of Gen. CQ Brown as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti and other senior leaders.",
      "Hegseth said his rationale \"has been straightforward,\" contending it's hard to change a culture with people who benefited from that previous culture.",
      "Brown never pushed \"quotas\" for promotions within the military, which relies on a merit-based system that Hegseth claimed wrongfully punished too many people for \"toxic leadership.\" Brown and others pushed the idea of recruiting from a broader section of America so that the military would look more like the nation it serves.",
      "The secretary added that the department is \"clearing the way for leaders to be leaders.\"",
      "\"You might say we are ending the war on warriors,\" Hegseth, who now goes by the title \"secretary of war,\" said.",
      "He told his audience that if all the new standards he has unveiled makes their \"hearts sink,\" then they should resign.",
      "Hegseth pressed hard, as part of the broader rebranding ordered by Trump, the importance of enforcing combat standards that keep troops lethal.",
      "Trump followed Hegseth with his own speech, saying that as president, he would have their backs and that he is committed to making the military \"stronger, tougher, faster, fiercer and more powerful than it has ever been before.\"",

      "\"I am not opting this in, I am cannonballing it into the state of Nebraska,\u201d Pillen said as he announced the move Monday at Catholic school in Lincoln. He was joined by Republican U.S. Reps. Mike Flood and Adrian Smith, both of Nebraska, who supported the federal budget bill and private school scholarship plan.",
      "The measure is remarkably similar to one the state Legislature passed in 2023 to allow corporations and individuals to divert millions of dollars they owe in state income taxes to nonprofit organizations, which would in turn award that money as private school tuition scholarships. Lawmakers axed the measure the following year after opponents gathered far more signatures than was needed to ask voters to repeal it. The Legislature then passed a new law funding private school scholarships directly from state coffers.",
      "The new federal law that Pillen opted into allows individual taxpayers to direct up to $1,700 in federal income taxes owed to scholarship-granting groups to be used for eligible K-12 private school expenses. But unlike Nebraska's 2023 proposal, the federal measure allows even high-income households to receive public money for private school costs. Eligibility extends to families earning up to 300% of the area median gross income, according to the Nebraska State Education Association \u2014 the state\u2019s largest teachers union.",

      "Labor Department revisions earlier this month showed that the economy created 911,000 fewer jobs than originally reported in the year that ended in March. That meant that employers added an average of fewer than 71,000 new jobs a month over that period, not the 147,000 first reported. Since March, job creation has slowed even more \u2014 to an average 53,000 a month.",

      "NAIROBI, Kenya -- Workers and industry are bracing for the end of a longstanding U.S. trade agreement that gave African exporters preferential treatment and now leaves businesses vulnerable to new competitive pressures and tariffs.",
      "The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) will terminate as scheduled on Tuesday amid uncertainty over renegotiations and the looming impact of new tariffs announced by the White House in April.",
      "AGOA is a multilateral trade agreement that has given thousands of products from qualifying African nations duty-free access to U.S. markets since 2000.",
      "A key example of the deal's impact can be found in Kenya, where it has allowed the country\u2019s textile and apparel sector \u2014 makers of jeans, for instance \u2014 to effectively compete with Asian exporters such as in Bangladesh and Vietnam.",
      "\u201cIf AGOA goes away we have zero chance to compete with the Asian countries,\u201d said Pankaj Bedi, owner of United Aryan, an apparel manufacturer in Nairobi that exports Levi's and Wrangler jeans to the U.S.",

      "\u201cI will be asking (Trump) for the U.S. to consider seriously renewing and extending AGOA for at least a minimum of five years,\u201d Kenyan president William Ruto said last week at the UN General Assembly in New York. \u201cIt is a platform that connects Africa and the U.S. in a very fundamental way.\u201d",
      "AGOA had also given African countries hope that major elements of their export economies would be exempt from blanket tariffs of 10% \u2014 and in some cases much higher \u2014 announced by the U.S. earlier this year.",
      "Kenya is already paying 10% on non-AGOA exports, which are not many. Kenyan manufacturers will struggle to compete with rivals in Asia, even though some Asian countries may face a higher U.S. tariff, because of the limited domestic supply chain in Kenya where most of the raw materials are imported, as well as higher energy costs, lending rates, and operating expenses.",
      "Ruto and other African leaders are pushing for a last-minute renegotiation of AGOA while also scrambling to sign new bilateral agreements with the U.S. They are doing so amid a period of seismic change in global trade dynamics and with a White House that shows a mixed commitment to Africa.",
      "\u201cAfrican countries including Kenya must be alive to the possibility that AGOA won\u2019t be extended, AGOA won\u2019t be remodified, and \u2026 America won\u2019t be interested in having a trade pact,\u201d said Raphael Obonyo, a public policy expert at UN Habitat.",
      "Ruto said last week that Kenya and the U.S had made \u201cgood progress\u201d toward a bilateral agreement that could be signed by the end of this year.",
      "AGOA has mostly benefitted African economies in both big and small industries. The agreement has helped both the continent\u2019s largest exporters\u2014Nigerian and Angolan oil, South African autos, and Kenyan clothing\u2014as well as some of its smallest economies where exports are highly concentrated, such as Lesotho and Eswatini.",

    "story": [
      "A new lawsuit against Brown University has sparked debate over the secrecy of law enforcement at private colleges",
      "PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- A new lawsuit against Brown University has renewed questions surrounding the secrecy afforded many law enforcement officers employed by private colleges and universities across the U.S.",
      "Unlike public campuses, private higher education institutions are largely exempt from disclosing arrest records, incident reports and other documents even as they employ officers who have the authority to detain students, as well as, in some cases, use force. This lack of transparency has long raised objections from watchdog groups and open government advocates who say such records are critical to holding law enforcement accountable.",
      "In a recently filed legal challenge, the American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island is hoping to make a dent in that practice by arguing that Brown\u2019s police department should comply with the state\u2019s public records law.",
      "\u201cThese private university police officers have the same arrest powers, detention powers, and other powers that any other police officer has in the state working for a city or town,\u201d said Steven Brown, Rhode Island's ACLU executive director. \u201cWe think that in light of that fact, they should be treated the same as public police officers.\u201d",
      "So far Brown has declined to comment on the lawsuit, but their attorneys have filed a motion to dismiss the suit.",
      "Connecticut, Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas and Virginia are just the handful of states where private institution\u2019s police departments are subject to public records laws, according to the Student Press Law Center. The rest are largely exempt. In Massachusetts, the state Supreme Court explicitly ruled Harvard University's campus police were not subject to the state's open records laws because they were a private university.",
      "At Brown, the ACLU is representing two journalists who were both denied their public records requests seeking arrest reports made by Brown's officers. ACLU claims Brown's campus police operate under state-authorized police powers, which in turn makes them subject to Rhode Island public records law.",
      "Both reporters, one a former Brown student who wrote for the independent university newspaper and the other a reporter with Motif Magazine, filed complaints with the state hoping to appeal their denial. However, the state attorney general's office issued an opinion siding with Brown police.",
      "\u201cWhenever people are being arrested and criminally charged, state law gives the public \u2014 and therefore the press acting on behalf of the public \u2014 the right and the duty to find out what the police are doing in their name,\u201d said Michael Bilow, a plaintiff in the lawsuit and a reporter with Motif Magazine.",
      "\u201cIf the public and the press can\u2019t find out what the police are doing using the power of the law then what you end up with is a secret police,\u201d he added.",

      "Under the Clery Act, colleges and universities that receive federal funding are required to collect data on campus crime and notify students of threats \u2014 something that the majority of both private and public schools accept. Schools must disseminate an annual security report that includes crime reports and information on efforts to improve campus safety.",
      "These reports provide public safety information on their campus, but they're not always comprehensive. Last year, Liberty University agreed to pay the U.S. Department of Education an unprecedented $14 million fine in part for its failure to disclose information about crimes on its campus.",
      "One former Brown police officer, who served at the department for 18 years, says he became increasingly alarmed at the culture he observed. Michael Greco says he witnessed a police force that prioritized limiting negative attention about the school, noting that fellow officers would often refer to the police department as the \u201cQueen's army\u201d dedicated to keeping information inside the \u201cBrown bubble.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt all revolved around this loophole in the law that Brown\u2019s a private institution with police powers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can then take what should be a public record and make it into a private record. And it seems that that was our primary purpose.\u201d",
      "Greco remembered one incident in 2021 where he and fellow colleagues were instructed not to use radios when responding to a possible bomb threat on campus where someone was threatening to \u201cshoot cops.\u201d Greco said the department didn't want to alert Providence police, which monitors the radio and would respond to that type of incident.",
      "While the bomb and shooter ended up being a false alarm, Greco says leadership was unhappy how he later described the incident in his report summarizing the events. Greco has since left the department, and filed a workers' compensation claim against Brown after developing post-traumatic stress disorder that he says he began experiencing after the 2021 incident. The case is being settled, according to court documents.",
      "Greco has since publicly called for more changes inside Brown University, including testifying in front of lawmakers in support of changing state law to explicitly make universities like Brown subject to open records law.",
      "\u201cI think there should be public pressure to get some of this changed,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should be held at least to the same standards as a public police department.\u201d",
      "Similar concerns are shared by some of the students also watching college campuses handle high-profile protests and working under President Donald Trump's administration.",
      "\u201cI think there needs to be greater transparency about what\u2019s going on with these arrests on campus, especially at a time when a lot of the public doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s happening in higher ed and there\u2019s disagreements nationally about the direction of higher ed and what it stands for,\u201d said Audrey Gmerek, a Brown University student.",

      "NEW ORLEANS -- Louisiana's Republican governor asked for National Guard deployments to New Orleans and other cities, saying Monday that his state needs help fighting crime and praising President Donald Trump's decision to send troops to Washington and Memphis.",
      "Gov. Jeff Landry, a Trump ally, asked for up to 1,000 troops through fiscal year 2026 in a letter sent to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. It comes weeks after Trump suggested New Orleans could be one of his next targets for deploying the National Guard to fight crime.",
      "Trump also sent troops in recent months to Los Angeles and his administration has announced plans for similar actions in other major cities, including Chicago and Portland, Oregon.",
      "Landry said his request \u201cbuilds on the proven success\u201d of deployments to Washington and Memphis. While Trump has ordered troops into Memphis with the backing of Tennessee's Republican governor, as of Monday night there had yet to be a large-scale operation in the city.",
      "\u201cFederal partnerships in our toughest cities have worked, and now, with the support of President Trump and Secretary Hegseth, we are taking the next step by bringing in the National Guard,\u201d Landry said.",
      "Leaders in Democratic-controlled states have criticized the planned deployments. In Oregon, elected officials have said troops in Portland are not needed.",
      "In his request, Landry said there has been \u201celevated violent crime rates\u201d in Shreveport, Baton Rouge and New Orleans as well as shortages in local law enforcement. He said the state\u2019s vulnerability to natural disasters made the issue more challenging and that extra support would be especially helpful for major events, including Mardi Gras and college football bowl games.",

      "The Utah university where Charlie Kirk was assassinated lacked several key public safety measures and practices that are standard security for events around the country",
      "The Utah college where conservative leader Charlie Kirk was assassinated lacked several key public safety measures and practices that have become standard safeguards for security at events around the country, an Associated Press review has found.",
      "Utah Valley University's outdoor courtyard, where Kirk showed up on Sept. 10 to debate students, was surrounded by several tall buildings, leaving Kirk vulnerable. That was made all the more potent because campus police didn't fly a drone to monitor rooftops or coordinate with local law enforcement to secure the event. It deployed only six officers from a force that was already small for a campus its size. There were no bag checks or metal detectors.",
      "A sniper took position on a nearby roof and killed Kirk with a single shot about 20 minutes after the event began, escaping notice from campus police.",
      "Security at Utah Valley University will come into sharper focus in the coming months as lawmakers and the public seek answers about what could have been done differently.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely there were security failures; it left him exposed,\u201d said Greg Shaffer, who oversaw Kirk\u2019s security from 2015 to 2022. \u201cIt was egregious enough that someone was able to take advantage and kill him.\u201d",
      "In an interview, the AP asked the university president, Astrid Tuminez, if there was a security failure on campus surrounding the Kirk assassination. \u201cSomebody was killed and that\u2019s a tragedy, I think that\u2019s what I would say right now,\u201d she responded. Tuminez declined to answer more detailed questions about campus security, citing a pending external review. A university spokesperson also declined to answer questions about staffing, equipment, security planning and budgets.",
      "The day Kirk spoke at UVU, it was clear and sunny \u2014 the perfect weather for a drone to have had a clear view of the roofs of the surrounding buildings, including where the assassin fired a deadly shot from a bolt action rifle at Kirk from about 400 feet (122 meters) away.",
      "But no drone had been deployed, though security experts said rooftop sniper attacks were a clear threat. That was evident as recently as last year when a rooftop gunman in Butler, Pennsylvania, fired shots at a rally held by President Donald Trump during his campaign, killing one, injuring two and wounding Trump.",
      "Ty Richmond, president of event services for security firm Allied Universal, said the attempted assassination Trump exposed the risk of failing to secure elevated areas. He said drones, which cost as little as $2,000, and video surveillance should be part of the tools used to assess and address threats at any outdoor event.",
      "\u201cIt was either not done comprehensively or not done at all, because that should have been a natural ability to identify and detect any high ground risk and exposures that you would have in a situation like that,\u201d Richmond said.",
      "The UVU campus had numerous cameras, including at least one overlooking the buildings around the courtyard. A university spokesperson declined to say whether someone was actively monitoring it or if it was operating.",
      "UVU has an enrollment of 48,000 students, though Tuminez said that includes 16,000 students who are in high school and don't take classes on campuses.",
      "The university has 23 police officers, or one for every 1,400 on-campus students, according to a 2024 UVU report. The average public university has around one officer for every 500 students, according to a 2024 U.S. Department of Justice study.",
      "\u201cThere is not a campus police department in this country that could provide the level of security necessary for a large scale outdoor event with 3,000 people,\u201d said S. Daniel Carter, a campus safety consultant. \u201cThey would need help, typically from a local law enforcement agency.\u201d",
      "UVU had six campus police officers present at the event along with Kirk\u2019s personal security detail, campus police Chief Jeffrey Long said after the shooting. Utah County Attorney Jeffrey Gray said during a news conference that a UVU police officer had been watching the crowd from an \u201celevated position.\u201d",
      "Officials at the Utah County Sheriff\u2019s Office and Orem Police Department, both of which have drones, said they were not involved in security for the event.",
      "A UVU spokesperson said unlike other schools with larger security staffs, they don\u2019t have dormitories to secure. However, other Utah schools of similar size with largely commuter populations have higher ratios of officers to students.",

And the University of Utah, with 36,000 primarily commuter students, has 46 officers.",
      "Overall spending on public safety varied at those universities in 2025 \u2014 $2.3 million at Weber State and $16.2 million at the University of Utah where a 2018 murder of a student led to more spending on security. UVU officials declined to share a current budget for their department, but a legislative audit showed $1.6 million was earmarked for public safety in 2020 out of a nearly $250 million campus budget.",
      "UVU, located between Salt Lake City suburbs and Brigham Young University in Provo, grew from a community college of less than 9,000 in the early 1990s to roughly 48,000 this year thanks to the addition of four-year degrees and campus expansions. But public safety failed to keep up, said two former campus public safety leaders. Both spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared repercussions.",
      "Val Peterson, UVU\u2019s vice president for administration & strategic relations, rejected pleas for more safety resources, including hiring more officers and offering higher salaries to keep skilled personnel, the former public safety leaders said. Peterson, who is also a Republican state lawmaker leading state appropriations, oversees UVU\u2019s public safety and has been with the university for more than 30 years.",
      "Both former campus public safety officials each recalled Peterson telling them multiple times in meetings related to public safety funding about a decade ago that because a shooting had not occurred on campus in decades, it would not happen in the future. Peterson believed the sleepy campus was safe from harm, they said. UVU's president declined to comment on Peterson's alleged remarks.",
      "Former UVU police Sgt. Bryan Cunningham also recalled those comments and, he said, officers warned the administration in budget discussions related to public safety that the campus could be the scene of an \u201cactive shooter nightmare\u201d due to its layout and understaffed police department.",
      "Peterson did not respond to requests for comment sent by phone and email to his private and public offices.",
      "At the time of the shooting, the university was without a fire marshal to help plan for safety at large events. And as recently as 2023, two of the university\u2019s three emergency radio channels did not meet state standards for signal strength, according to an internal review shared with the AP. The review did not include information about the third channel.",
      "Patchy reception was a serious problem that could hamper public safety personnel from coordinating during emergencies, one of the former campus public safety officials noted.",
      "The university boosted the signal at one building in the past year, Utah Communications Authority Executive Director Tina Mathieu said. She was not aware of any other improvements.",
      "A university spokesperson didn\u2019t respond to questions about campus emergency radio signal strength.",
      "Utah lawmakers pushed to improve public school security after the deadly 2022 elementary school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, by creating a task force, appointing a state security chief and requiring an \u201carmed guardian\u201d be present at every public school. They also mandated all K-12 schools conduct rigorous safety assessments.",
      "Rep. Ryan Wilcox, a Republican who chairs the task force, introduced legislation this year to require public universities to conduct the same assessments, but the provision was removed by the state senate.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t believe the provision in the bill would have changed the outcome of the current situation,\u201d said Republican Sen. Ann Millner, who co-chairs the task force. She said that public universities should be entrusted to implement their own public safety practices \u201caligned with institutional realities\" and that any assessments would likely have taken a long time to complete.",
      "But Wilcox said the lack of mandatory security assessments can allow for vulnerabilities to go unnoticed: \u201cBecause those assessments haven\u2019t been done, I don\u2019t know what I don\u2019t know about how prepared we are.\"",

      "Victor Tony Jones, 64, is set to receive a lethal injection starting at 6 p.m. at Florida State Prison near Starke under a death warrant signed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. It would be Florida's 13th death sentence carried out in 2025, further extending the state record for total executions in a single year.",
      "Since the U.S. Supreme Court restored the death penalty in 1976, the highest previous annual total of Florida executions was eight in 2014. Florida has executed more people than any other state this year, followed by Texas with five. Two more executions are planned next month in Florida.",
      "Jones was convicted and sentenced to death in 1993 on two counts of first-degree murder. Jurors also found him guilty of two counts of armed robbery.",
      "Jones was a new employee at a Miami-Dade business owned by Matilda and Jacob Nestor in December 1990 when he stabbed the wife in the neck and the husband in the chest. Investigators determined that before he died from his wounds, Jacob Nestor managed to retreat to an office. He pulled a .22 caliber pistol from a holster and fired five times, striking Jones once in the forehead.",

      "DoorDash is adding restaurant reservations and robot deliveries to its menu in some U.S. markets",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 DoorDash is expanding its offerings, adding restaurant reservations and robot deliveries in some U.S. markets.",
      "The San Francisco-based company, already the largest U.S. delivery provider, announced its expansion plans Tuesday, saying it wants to bring even more business to the merchants it works with and stay ahead of ever-increasing customer demand. DoorDash's total orders jumped 20% to 761 million in the second quarter of this year.",
      "DoorDash's robots will bring new challenges to the company as it takes on the responsibility for storing and maintaining the devices. But DoorDash Co-Founder Stanley Tang said the company needs more delivery options to help fuel its future growth.",
      "\u201cThe shift to autonomy is happening right now, and DoorDash is uniquely positioned to do something like this,\u201d Tang said Monday during an interview at the company\u2019s San Francisco headquarters. \u201cWe need to find ways to keep up with the demand. The complexity of the deliveries being made on our platform is increasing too.\"",
      "But DoorDash's plans also threaten other delivery and reservation platforms like OpenTable and Instacart. On Monday, after DoorDash said it would expand its partnership with Kroger to offer delivery from the grocer\u2019s 2,700 U.S. stores, DoorDash's shares jumped 4% while Instacart's fell 10%.",
      "DoorDash said Tuesday that its new \u201cGoing Out\u201d tab will let users book tables at restaurants. Reservations will be offered first in New York and Miami, with other cities to be added later this year. In cities without restaurant reservation capabilities, the \u201cGoing Out\u201d tab will let DoorDash customers earn rewards and in-store offers.",
      "DoorDash said its DashPass members \u2013 who pay $9.99 for free deliveries on most orders \u2013 will also get extra perks, like the ability to reserve exclusive tables.",
      "DoorDash signaled its interest in adding reservations with its recent purchase of SevenRooms, a New York company that makes reservation and hospitality management software. DoorDash announced the $1.2 billion purchase in March.",
      "DoorDash said adding reservations and deals helps it deepen its relationship with restaurants and bring them new patrons. During testing in San Francisco, the company found that 80% of customers using \u201cGoing Out\u201d visited a restaurant they had never ordered food from before.",
      "DoorDash also said Tuesday it will soon begin providing deliveries in Phoenix with an autonomous robot. The robot, which was designed by DoorDash and is dubbed Dot, can reach speeds of up to 20 miles per hour and travel on streets, sidewalks and driveways.",
      "DoorDash has spent the last seven years developing the robot. The company decided to develop its own after finding that other delivery robots on the market, which are mostly designed for short runs on college campuses or urban sidewalks, weren\u2019t capable of operating in the suburban neighborhoods where DoorDash makes many of its deliveries.",

      "DoorDash executives view Dot\u2019s development as the next major step in an evolution that has already seen the company expand from a shoestring operation that was making a few restaurant deliveries in Palo Alto, California, 13 years ago. DoorDash has become a ubiquitous service that now operates in more than 30 countries.",
      "DoorDash has also been testing drone delivery for several years in Australia, Texas and North Carolina. Tang said the company is developing a system that will automatically determine the best mode of delivery depending on the order and where it's going.",

    "story": [
      "Chinese Premier Li Qiang has made a strong case for China's role in global governance at the United Nations General Assembly",
      "WASHINGTON -- Hardly a month after Chinese President Xi Jinping proposed his \u201cGlobal Governance Initiative,\u201d Beijing made its intent clear at the most global of forums \u2014 that it should, and is qualified to, help shape the world order even as the United States tips more inward under Donald Trump.",
      "In a seemingly jargon-filled speech delivered to the U.N. General Assembly on Friday, Chinese Premier Li Qiang told the audience that \u201ca China that bears in mind the greater good of humanity and stands ready to take up responsibilities will bring more positive energy into the world.\" His words seized on the retreat by the American president from international organizations and on his apparent disdain towards the United Nations.",
      "Li never once mentioned the United States by name. But in not-so-subtle swipes at recent actions by the United States, he touted his country's credentials: lowering tariffs to promote global economy, vowing to cut greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change and committing to safeguarding the authority of the United Nations.",
      "It represents a shift in approach to global affairs that experts say reflects a China that sees itself on the ascent.",
      "\u201cLi\u2019s speech confirms that China\u2019s foreign policy posture today is firmly anchored in the ambition of turning a Western-dominant world order into one that is much more conducive to Chinese interests, values, and leadership,\u201d said Olivia Cheung, lecturer in politics at King's College London. \u201cChina\u2019s foreign policy today is notably more confident, strategic, and coherent than how it was in 2017, where Beijing\u2019s presentation of global governance reform lacked content.\"",
      "The speech has come amid growing worries in Washington that China, the world's second-largest economy, might seek to unseat the United States as the global leader, even though Beijing has repeatedly assured Washington that it has no intention to challenge or replace the U.S. Instead, Xi has said Beijing should enjoy a global say befitting of its economic might and global stature.",
      "Li opened his speech by evoking the history of the United Nations and crediting it for the by-and-large peace and prosperity in the ensuing eight decades. Then, he lamented on the \u201cchaos\u201d the world is faced with today.",
      "\u201cThe world has entered a new period of turbulence and transformation,\u201d Li said, leveling his criticisms at \u201cunilateralism and Cold War mentality\" and repeated disruptions to the international system.",
      "\u201cHow could we, when confronted with unscrupulous acts of hegemonism and bullying, remain silent and submissive for fear of might?\u201d the Chinese premier asked. The terms \u201cunilateralism,\u201d \u201cCold War mentality,\u201d \u201chegemonism\u201d and \u201cbullying\u201d are usually associated with the U.S. in Beijing's diplomatic talks.",
      "Then, the Chinese premier portrayed China as a desirable answer to such problems \u2014 a founding member of the United Nations that has in recent years shared \u201cChina\u2019s wisdom and solution for navigating global transformations and overcoming pressing challenges.\u201d",
      "The Global Governance Initiative, as proposed by Xi in early September, \u201cpoints the right direction and provides an important pathway for building a more just and equitable global governance system,\u201d Li said.",
      "The reframing is, on some levels, fundamental.",
      "In a podcast aired Sept. 26, Cheung told the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations that Beijing's strategic thinking has shifted under Xi \u2014 from maintaining good ties with the U.S. and other Western nations for China's economic growth to \u201creshaping the international system so that the rest of the world respect and accept China\u2019s interest in the way that Beijing defines it.\"",

      "Li's speech Friday conveys the impression that Xi's proposition of \u201cforging the common destiny for humankind\u2019 is not only an aspiration but \u201dpolicy actions that are noble and urgent, with which China uniquely has strong technical competencies to lead,\" Cheung told the Associated Press.",
      "As the Trump administration imposes steep tariffs, threatens territorial annexations and goes after multilateral institutions, \u201cChina seeks to present itself as a key upholder of a postwar order in whose viability the United States seems to be losing confidence\u201d, said Ali Wyne, a senior research and advocacy advisory for U.S.-China relations at the International Crisis Group.",
      "But China does not appear to have either the capacity or the desire to offer a wholesale alternative, Wyne said. Instead, he said, China appears interested in deepening its influences in certain areas and attempting to legitimize its longstanding contention that new norms are needed to reflect emerging geopolitical trends.",
      "The gulf between Beijing's words and its actions is another question. Where the Chinese government is concerned, its action often fails to align with its word, said Craig Singleton, senior director of the China Program at the Washington-based think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies.",
      "\u201cPremier Li\u2019s remarks leaned heavily on multilateral language, but Beijing\u2019s track record tells a different story,\" Singleton said. \u201cChina champions sovereignty at the U.N. while systematically eroding it in practice, from Hong Kong to the South China Sea.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cLi\u2019s calls for \u2018cooperation\u2019 and \u2018openness\u2019 sound constructive, but they\u2019re designed to blunt pressure on China\u2019s economy and technology sector.\"",
      "A day earlier, Li held a meeting with American businesspeople and scholars in New York. He assured the group that China would \u201ccontinuously expand market access and increase imports\u201d and provide foreign businesses with \u201cthe certainty they need to operate and develop in China,\u201d according to a Chinese government statement.",
      "The two countries are locked in a trade dispute, and Xi and Trump are scheduled to meet on the sidelines of the summit of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation grouping of 21 economies, to be held at the end of October in South Korea, to help recalibrate bilateral relations.",
      "The Chinese premier said the two countries \u201ccould and should\u201d become partners and friends, and he repeated a line from Xi: \u201cThe Pacific Ocean is vast enough to accommodate both China and the United States, as well as other countries.\"",

    "story": [
      "New York \u2014\u00a0Prosecutors urged a New York federal judge Tuesday to send Sean \"Diddy\" Combs to prison for over 11 years following his conviction on prostitution-related charges, citing one of his accusers who said she lives in fear of the music mogul's release from detention.",
      "\"His crimes of conviction are serious and have warranted sentences over ten years in multiple cases for defendants who, like Sean Combs, engaged in violence and put others in fear,\" they wrote in a presentence submission requesting at least 11 years and three months in prison.",
      "They filed their sentencing recommendation shortly after midnight, including letters from some of his accusers describing how his violence and demands had impacted their lives.",
      "Prosecutors called Combs \"unrepentant\" and said Combs had conceded his acts of violence and abuse throughout his trial but \"incredibly ... he now argues that his victims should shoulder the blame.\"",
      "Combs, 55, has remained jailed since his July conviction on charges related to arranging male sex workers to travel to hotels or residences where he directed them to have sex with his girlfriends.",
      "The elaborate dayslong, drug-fueled sexual events were often filmed by Combs. Defense attorneys have asked that he be sentenced to no more than 14 months in prison. Sentencing is set for Friday. The music mogul had pleaded not guilty to all of the charges brought against him.",
      "In July, Combs was convicted of two charges for violating the Mann Act, which outlaws interstate commerce related to prostitution, for arranging the paid sexual encounters between his girlfriends and male sex workers. Each count carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.",
      "The same jury acquitted the Bad Boy Records founder of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges that could have resulted in a life sentence.",
      "Last week, the defense submitted its presentence arguments, saying Combs has suffered enough during his nearly 13 months behind bars and that he should be freed soon.",
      "They wrote that he became a changed man in a Brooklyn federal lockup, where he has been under constant suicide watch and learned to react calmly rather than violently to threats, even when a fellow inmate confronted him with a shiv.",
      "They said Combs has realized that his overuse of drugs, including some prescribed by doctors, had contributed to violent acts he participated in.",
      "Prosecutors said Combs was now trying to cast himself as a victim.",
      "\"He is not the victim,\" they wrote. \"The Court should focus on the very real effects that the defendant's conduct had on the lives of the actual victims, his victims.\"",
      "At trial, two of Combs' former girlfriends testified that they felt forced to participate in the drug-fueled sex marathons with male sex workers as Combs watched and sometimes filmed.",
      "Ex-girlfriends tell court about treatment by Coombs",
      "R&B singer Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura described being beaten by Combs when she displeased him during their decadelong relationship. Another ex-girlfriend, testifying under the pseudonym \"Jane,\" said she felt pressured to perform sexually with male sex workers. She testified that an enraged Combs once put her in a chokehold and punched her in the face.",
      "In a letter accompanying the prosecutors' submission, Cassie wrote that she testified while nine months pregnant during Combs' trial \"in front of a packed courtroom about the most traumatic and horrifying chapter in my life. I testified that from age nineteen, Sean Combs used violence, threats, substances, and control over my career to trap me in over a decade of abuse.\"",
      "Cassie wrote that Combs controlled her like a puppet.",
      "\"These events were degrading and disgusting, leaving me with infections, illnesses, and days of physical and emotional exhaustion before he demanded it all again. Sex acts became my full-time job, used as the only way to stay in his good graces,\" she said.",
      "Cassie said she still has nightmares and flashbacks on an everyday basis and requires psychological care to cope.",
      "\"My worries that Sean Combs or his associates will come after me and my family is my reality. I have in fact moved my family out of the New York area and am keeping as private and quiet as I possibly can because I am so scared that if he walks free, his first actions will be swift retribution towards me and others who spoke up about his abuse at trial,\" Cassie said.",
      "The AP does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, as Cassie has.",
      "In an indictment, prosecutors asserted that Combs used his fame, wealth and violence to force and manipulate Cassie and Jane, now-ex-girlfriends, into the sexual performances he called \"freak-offs\" or \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Judge Arun Subramanian has signaled that he is leaning toward a substantial amount of prison time, twice\u00a0refusing to grant bail\u00a0since the jury returned its verdict, citing Combs' history of violence.",

      "Italian actress Claudia Cardinale (April 15, 1938-Sept.\u00a023, 2025) starred in more than 100 films and TV productions, and was best known for her roles in Federico Fellini's \"8\u00bd,\" and Luchino Visconti's \"The Leopard.\" She was also a U.N. goodwill ambassador for women's rights.",
      "The daughter of Sicilian parents, her career began after winning a beauty pageant in Tunisia at age 17. That led to a trip to the Venice Film Festival, and offers to appear in movies. She turned them down, at first. \"It's like a man,\" she told The Guardian in 2013. \"When he's going after you, if you say yes immediately, after a little time he goes away. If you say no, he desires you for a long time.\"",
      "Often compared to Brigitte Bardot, Cardinale found success working with such directors as Mario Monicelli (\"Big Deal on Madonna Street\"), Luchino Visconti (\"Rocco and His Brothers,\" \"The Leopard,\" \"Conversation Piece\"), Sergio Leone (\"Once Upon a Time in the West\") and Werner Herzog (\"Fitzcarraldo\").",
      "She appeared in some Hollywood productions, including \"The Pink Panther\" with Peter Sellers, \"Circus World\" with John Wayne, \"Don't Make Waves\" with Tony Curtis, and \"The Professionals\" with Burt Lancaster. But she refused to sign exclusivity contracts with American studios, and so the majority of her appearances were in international films.",
      "A staple of Italian and French cinema, she continued working into her 80s. Of her roles, which extended from the sultry to the grand dame, she proudly said in 2013, \"I was never naked and I never did anything to change my face. I don't like that at all. I like to be what I am, because you cannot stop time.\""

    "summary": "His music dates back to the birth of rock 'n' roll, as an early bandmate of Buddy Holly, and the writer of such classic songs as \"I Fought the Law.\" But Sonny Curtis' most memorable composition may be a TV theme song that turned the world on with a smile.",
    "story": [
      "The theme song to \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" is familiar to generations of TV watchers. The name of the man who wrote and sang it, less so.",
      "Who can turn the world on with her smile?Who can take a nothing day, and suddenly make it all seem worthwhile?Well, it's you, girl, and you should know itWith each glance and every little movement you show it",
      "Love is all around, no need to waste itYou can have the town, why don't you take itYou're gonna make it after all",
      "But by the time Sonny Curtis recorded \"Love Is All Around\" in 1970, he'd \"made it\" several times over himself, as a songwriter, as a recording artist, and as an early bandmate of the legendary Buddy Holly.",
      "Born in 1937 in rural West Texas, Curtis grew up picking cotton on his father's farm. \"Oh, it was a miserable job,\" he told correspondent Mo Rocca. \"The heavier the cotton sack gets, the worse it is, man.\"",
      "His love of music came from family. His aunt taught him to play the guitar, and while working those fields, Curtis dreamed up his own songs: \"Driving a tractor, you go down half a mile that way, and when you get there, you turn around and come back a half mile this way. You have plenty of time to write a song!\"",
      "Curtis was just 14 when he met a young Buddy Holly in nearby Lubbock. \"Buddy had black hair, but he had dyed it blonde, and it was growing out. And he reminded me of a black-and-tan coon hound. We sorta skipped all the niceties and got our guitars and started playing.\"",
      "Rocca asked, \"How quickly did you realize this guy's serious about music?\"",
      "\"Buddy, he exuded confidence. He just knew he was gonna make it big one day.\"",
      "The two became fast friends, bonded by their love of music. Sometimes, Curtis said, he'd spend the night at Buddy's. The two would wake up at midnight and flip on the car radio for a show out of Shreveport, Louisiana, to hear some of the rhythm and blues voices that would shape rock 'n' roll: \"We heard, oh, Big Mama Thornton and Lonnie Johnson, and Lead Belly, Little Richard, Ray Charles, you name it.\"",
      "\"Were you just absorbing this?\" asked Rocca.",
      "\"Oh, boy, were we ever, yeah!\"",
      "Buddy and Sonny had formed a band and were still figuring out their own sound, when a then little-known Elvis Presley came to town. \"And I mean, the girls were goin' nuts, man. And that really got our attention. All a sudden, we thought, this not only involves music, this involves pretty girls!\"",
      "When Elvis came back to town in 1956, Buddy and Sonny's band was the opening act. \"Well, I guess we were right there sort of at the beginning of rock 'n' roll.\"",
      "\"What was Elvis like backstage?\" asked Rocca.",
      "\"He was just an old boy.\"",
      "The band went on to record some demos, but wasn't making much money.",
      "So, Curtis left to tour with country star Slim Whitman. \"He treated me kind of like a little brother,\" Curtis said. \"I remember I'd be on the stage and he'd come over and say, 'Now don't be nervous.'\"",
      "Meanwhile, Buddy Holly formed a new band, which would prove to be seminal. The Crickets shot to fame, appearing on \"The Ed Sullivan Show.\"",
      "Rocca asked, \"When that was happening, did you feel a little left out, like, 'Ugh'?\"",
      "\"I did feel kind of like the train left the station and I wasn't on it, you know?\" Curtis replied.",
      "But on February 3, 1959, Curtis' friend and former bandmate died in a plane crash near Clear Lake Iowa.",
      "Curtis served as a pallbearer.",
      "\"Buddy Holly was 22 when he died,\" Rocca said.",
      "\"Yes. Can you imagine the amount of music he pumped into the system in a short period of, like, 18 months? No telling how much he would've contributed had he been around.\"",
      "By that time, Curtis had joined the Crickets. But with Holly gone, the band felt rudderless.",
      "It was Curtis' talent for songwriting that helped put the wind back in his sails. His song \"Walk Right Back'' became a big hit for the Everly Brothers:",
      "And then there's this classic, which Curtis claims he wrote in about 20 minutes: \"I Fought the Law\":",
      "\"I Fought the Law\" has been covered by artists from The Bobby Fuller Four to The Clash.",
      "Sonny Curtis is 84 now. He and Louise, his wife of more than 50 years, live outside Nashville, where they raised their daughter, Sarah. He is enshrined in Nashville's Musicians Hall of Fame \u2013 as is his old guitar.",
      "In 2012, the year the Crickets retired, they were inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame.",
      "But it's a song Curtis wrote for the small screen that may be his most enduring legacy.",
      "In 1970, he was living in Los Angeles when he got a call from a friend about a new sitcom being produced for Mary Tyler Moore: \"It was just this young girl gets jilted in this small community, and she moves to the big city of Minneapolis, gets a job at a news station. And that was about it.\"",
      "Curtis wrote the theme song based on a four-page description of the show. \"I honed in on the part that she rented an apartment she had a hard time affording, and wrote, 'How will you make it on your own?' \u2026 'This world is awfully big, and girl, this time you're all alone.'\"",
      "Within just a few hours, Curtis was summoned to the studio to play his song for producer James L. Brooks. Curtis recalled, \"I got my guitar out and I sang it to him. He smiled and said, 'Sing that again.' And I had to sing it about ten times. And before I left that afternoon, the room was full of people standing all around the walls. I thought, 'I believe I got a shot at this!'\"",
      "WEB EXTRA: Sonny Curtis on writing the \"Mary Tyler Moore Show\" theme song",
      "Rocca said, \"It wasn't a given that you'd write and sing it.\"",
      "\"No. As a matter of fact they didn't want me to sing it. I said, 'I wanna sing this,' you know? And I was probably more pushy than I should have been, if I'da known better. But fortunately, I didn't know better at the time!\"",
      "When the show became a hit, Curtis was asked to rework his song: \"When they started to do the second season, he said, 'Sonny, she's obviously made it. And we have to have some new lyrics.'\"",
      "For a man whose career dates back to the birth of rock 'n' roll, Sonny Curtis remains disarmingly humble. \"Oh, I've always sort of had a rule, don't give advice in a crowd,\" he laughed.",
      "But when pressed, he will share some wisdom: \"If they say, 'Man, you oughta go back to Texas 'cause you'll never make it,' just look at them and say, 'No, you're wrong, because I am gonna make it.'\"",
      "Rocca replied, \"You know, I should write this down, 'cause this sounds like a song right here!\"",

      "\"We thought exactly that,\" Argent replied. \"But they saw us as doing something really quite different. But we realize now that we did really have something quite original. We really did have our own stamp.\"",
      "But there was a problem: Money. There wasn't any.",
      "Blunstone said, \"We were 19 years old, we were very na\u00efve, and we didn't realize what our options were. So, I'm afraid that touring revenue was poor. Sometimes non-existent!\"",
      "Not only that, they felt their music had stagnated and suffered. They decided to produce their own album, in their own way. They went to the mothership of British rock, the famous Abbey Road Studios in London.",
      "Returning there, Blunstone said, \"You do get this really emotional feeling walking into it. Because, I mean, there's so much history in these walls.\"",
      "The session produced what became their signature album, \"Odessey and Oracle,\" now considered one of rock 'n' roll's greats. But not then. Then, it sank without a trace. \"There was no real interest in us,\" Argent said.",
      "Blunstone said, \"I thought we had a chance, but it became fairly clear fairly quickly that the industry pretty much ignored it, really.\"",
      "The Zombies thought it was all over and broke up. Blunstone took a job in insurance. Grundy sold cars. White and Argent wrote songs for other people, including this one for Argent's new band: \"Hold Your Head Up.\"",
      "But \"Odessey and Oracle\" wouldn't die. More than a year later, one of the tracks, \"Time of the Season,\" started to get some play.",
      "\"Famously there was one DJ in Boise, Idaho who kept playing 'Time of the Season,'\" said Blunstone. \"It spread to other radio stations. It took months for it to be a hit, but again, it went to number one in Cash Box.\"",
      "Finally, more than 50 years after their hits, The Zombies made it into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame; and now, a remastered version of \"Odessey and Oracle\" has been released.",
      "\"Now,\" said Blunstone, \"it gets name-checked as a major influence in so many people's careers.\"",
      "\"Considered a Top 50 rock album, iconic rock album,\" I added.",
      "\"I know! And here we are. Is it nearly 70 years later? It's a very strange story.\"",

    "summary": "The actress talks about playing a screen goddess in the film adaptation of the Broadway musical \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\"; her love of movie musicals; and her long road from the Bronx to Hollywood.",
    "story": [
      "The first thing you notice about Jennifer Lopez' perch over West Hollywood is the Old Hollywood part of it. Images of Barbra Streisand, Bette Davis and the Rat Pack all bedazzle the walls.",
      "\"I love making movies,\" she said, pointing to one photo. \"And I feel like this is me a little bit. But it's not me, it's Sophia Loren! And with the crew there, and this is what my life is: it's me by a camera doing this every day!\"",
      "Lopez is a movie mainstay. She's made at least one film almost every year for the past three decades. Some were memorable, others weren't. Golden Globes and Oscars both eluded her. But this year just might be different, due to \"Kiss of the Spider Woman,\" an old-fashioned musical. \"I just thought to myself, This is what I've been waiting for my whole life,\" she said. \"I grew up on musicals. My mom loved musicals, and so I saw every musical you can think of. She was a fanatic!\"",
      "I asked, \"How many times do you think you saw 'West Side Story'?\"",
      "\"So many,\" she sighed. \"And it wasn't, 'Oh I've seen it about five times.' No! I've seen it hundreds of times! I feel like, so much!\"",
      "No surprise one of her idols is Rita Moreno, the other the late Chita Rivera, who starred in \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\" on Broadway \u2013 the same Tony-winning shoes that Lopez is now trying to fill.",
      "Does she feel the weight of that? \"I kind of let it go and understood that I had to make it my own,\" she said.",
      "It came, though, at a tough time in her personal life \u2013 Ben Affleck, her now ex-husband, is one of the film's executive producers. \"It was a really tough time,\" she said. \"Every moment on set, every moment I was doing this role, I was so happy. And then, it was like, back home it was not great. And it was just like, Oh, you know, how do I reconcile this?\"",
      "Their divorce was settled the same month that \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\" premiered at Sundance. \"It was the best thing that ever happened to me,\" she said. \"Because it changed me \u2026 It didn't change me, it helped me grow in a way that I needed to grow.\"",
      "The bright music of \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\" is a purposeful contrast to the film's darker tale. It's an escape for two cellmates in an Argentinian prison: Molina, a queer window dresser; and Valentin, a proud Marxist revolutionary. Going to a movie in their mind helped ease their drudgery, and dissolve their differences.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\" click on the video player below:",
      "Lopez said, \"It is a love letter, in a way, to the Latin community and to the queer community, this movie, because in a time like this \u2026 those communities are being demonized and marginalized.\"",
      "Inclusion and acceptance have always been themes in her music. Performing at the 2020 Super Bowl halftime show in Miami, one of her twins, Emme (whom she had with her third husband Marc Anthony), sang with her proudly about the challenges of identity \u2013 cultural and otherwise. \"Singing that with my child there, and them screaming that back to me \u2013 'cause I'm gonna live my life \u2013 that was one of the best moments in my life,\" said Lopez, who then apologized for getting emotional thinking back on that. \"I didn't know it would catch me like that. It was one of the best moments of my life. Being so joyful and happy and being exactly who they were.\"",
      "The kind of global platform that she has now was unimaginable back when, against her parents' wishes, she dropped out of college and ran from her home in the Bronx chasing the city lights of Manhattan.",
      "With no place to stay, she slept on a bench at the Phil Black Dance Studio on Broadway. \"I crashed there for a while,\" she said. \"You know, when you're young you can do stuff like that. You don't know what's gonna happen to you.\"",
      "\"It's not an inconvenience,\" I said.",
      "\"No! You're like, whatever. Great! I can sleep here. I'll sleep here!\"",
      "As a kid, seeing a live Broadway show was a rare privilege, but the experience stuck. \"I remember sitting in an audience, watching a live show one time,\" she said. \"And I was with a friend, and I said, 'When you see that, don't you want to be up there, doing that?' And they were like, 'No!' And I was like, 'Okay. Is it just me?'\"",
      "In-between her auditions, Lopez was selling programs for \"Phantom of the Opera\" out in front of the Majestic Theatre. \"I was, like, really using my best tactics,\" she said. \"Like, I swing it up in the air and, like, you know, kind of try to be charming and funny!\"",
      "It was a winding road that finally got Jennifer Lopez to her own musical. It might just be that going back in time to Old Hollywood \u00a0-- is what pushes her Hollywood career forward.",
      "\"The hard times are the lessons, and you have to understand that,\" she said. \"You have to understand that. And once you do, everything just becomes a little bit lighter. And you can really, really fly.\"",
      "\"Does it feel like you're flying now?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes. It does. It does,\" she replied. \"And I still feel like I want to fly higher. I want to see more. I want to do more things.\"",

    "summary": "With time running out to avert a government shutdown, millions of Americans who get health insurance under the Affordable Care Act could soon face sharply higher premiums.",
    "story": [
      "A possible U.S. government shutdown\u00a0on Wednesday could hinge on a deal to maintain a tax credit that helps 22 million Americans lower their health insurance costs when they buy policies through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces.",
      "Known as the enhanced premium tax credit, the subsidy has been used by millions of low- and middle-class households since it was authorized under the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021. Since then, spurred by the tax credit, the number of people who have enrolled in ACA marketplace health insurance plans has almost doubled, according to health care publication KFF.",
      "But it is set to expire at the end of 2025, and leading Democratic lawmakers are making a funding deal to keep the government open contingent on Republicans agreeing to extend the credit.",
      "Even as the outcome of the funding negotiations in Washington, D.C., remains uncertain, expiration of the premium health care credits could inflict financial pain on millions of Americans, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"Insurers are already preparing to send notices to households that they will see increases starting in January 2026,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy at Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal economic advocacy group, and former a White House economic official under former President Joe Biden, on a conference call Friday to discuss the tax credit.",
      "He added, \"People are more and more concerned about the cost of living, and [this is] a hit to their pocketbooks that they will start seeing in weeks.\"",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the enhanced ACA premium tax credits set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "How much could ACA premiums increase?",
      "The cost of premiums for people who buy their insurance through the ACA marketplaces could more than double, rising from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to a Sept. 30 analysis by KFF.\u00a0About 4 million people would likely drop their insurance coverage if the credit is allowed to expire because they would't be able to afford the costs, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The premium tax credit is aimed at people who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans, and who can't get affordable health care through an employer. The credit is available for those who earn between 100% to 400% of the poverty level, which means a family of four with annual income of up to $128,600 would qualify for the credit.",
      "With expiration of the ACA coverage credit only months away, some policy holders have already received noticed that their premiums \u2014 the monthly fee paid for insurance coverage \u2014 are poised to surge next year. Insurers have sent out notices in nearly every state, with some proposing premium increases of as much as 50%.",
      "Insurers are already planning on substantial premium hikes in 2026, according to a Peterson KFF Health System Tracker survey published last month. The poll found that 312 insurers participating in ACA marketplaces are proposing median increases of 18% next year, about 11 percentage points higher than in 2025.",
      "That increase would represent the largest rate hike since 2018, and is driven by higher costs for medical care as well as the expiration of the premium tax credits. Sharply higher ACA premiums would likely cause healthier people to drop coverage, making it more expensive to insure those who remain, the group said.",
      "The proposed hikes range from a high of 39.9%, from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma, to a low of 4.6% for Oscar Garden State Insurance Corporation, their survey found.",
      "In Iowa last month, the state's insurance commissioner weighed increases ranging from 3% to 37%, arousing public concerns. One woman who runs a garden center in Cedar Falls, Iowa, said she was considering dropping health insurance altogether.",
      "\"I am already living as frugally as I possibly can while working as hard as I possibly can, putting in as many hours as I am allowed to at my job, never missing a day of work,\" one woman, LuAnn, wrote in a comment published on the commissioner's website.",
      "Signs of financial fragility",
      "The potential hike in insurance costs comes as many Americans continue struggling with the cost of living, said Rohit Chopra, former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, on the conference call with Jacquez, organized by Groundwork, which supports extending the credits.",
      "\"Some people will need to drop their insurance all together, but households with someone with a chronic illness will have to pay those big, big increases,\" Chopra said. That would require some families to make tough financial choices, such as not paying other bills or accumulating debt to cover their expenses, he added.",
      "Although inflation around the U.S. has eased significantly since its post-pandemic peak in 2022, costs continue to inch higher. The Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target is slipping further from reach this year, with the Consumer Price Index climbing higher in recent months. Some consumers are showing signs of increasing financial stress, with credit card delinquencies on the rise and balances creeping higher.",
      "Meanwhile, many Americans aren't aware that the ACA enhanced premium tax credits will expire in a matter of months, KFF found in a survey.",
      "\"Consumers should not panic, but they do need to prepare,\" Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at insurance website Healthinsurance.org, said in an email.",
      "People should make sure to compare various plans available to them on the marketplaces and explore options such as Health Savings Plans, which allows people to set aside money to pay for medical expenses, she said.",
      "\"Being proactive will help minimize financial surprises,\" Norris said.",

    "summary": "President Trump's announcement this week about an alleged link between Tylenol and autism has drawn pushback from medical experts.",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett on \"The Takeout\" Thursday the Trump administration is not advising pregnant women to avoid taking Tylenol under any circumstances \u2014 as President Trump's announcement this week about an alleged link between the painkiller and fever reducer and autism draws pushback from medical experts.",
      "Oz \u2014 a former surgeon and television personality who leads the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, an agency that is under the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 said that if a pregnant woman develops a high fever, a doctor will likely encourage her to take acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, because fevers can pose health risks. And\u00a0studies show acetaminophen is the safest medication to treat fevers in pregnant women.",
      "\"The concern here is that I believe most women get low-grade fevers, they stub their toe, they have little aches and pains, and they think it's perfectly safe to throw a couple paracetamol or acetaminophen or Tylenol when they're pregnant, and I don't think that's the case,\" Oz said.",
      "On Monday, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary released an open letter to physicians that said acetaminophen use during pregnancy \"may be associated with\" an increased risk of conditions like autism.",
      "The letter noted that \"while an association between acetaminophen and autism has been described in many studies, a causal relationship has not been established.\"",
      "Makary's letter was also more tempered than Mr. Trump's comments during a news conference earlier this week in which the president said there's \"no downside in not taking\" Tylenol.",
      "\"Acetaminophen is the safest over-the-counter alternative in pregnancy among all analgesics and antipyretics,\" Makary wrote in his letter.",
      "There is concern among the medical community that, as a result of the FDA's announcement Monday, that some patients could turn to other pain medications that are proven to be unsafe during pregnancy.",
      "\"You should not, under any circumstances, avoid taking acetaminophen if you have a fever early in pregnancy, if you have a headache, if you have some other condition in pregnancy, we want you to take that medication,\" Dr. Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, told CBS News following the FDA's announcement. \"The overwhelming evidence that we have seen over the last 20 years does not show causation for acetaminophen causing autism.\"",
      "In a statement in response to the FDA's announcement, Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, said, \"Independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism,\" calling it \"the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy.\"",
      "Oz also addressed Makary's announcement that the agency will approve the prescription drug leucovorin, which is derived from folic acid, to treat autism in children. Specialists say leucovorin can be helpful in treating some autism cases, but it is not a universal remedy.",
      "\"The key question is, if you, as a researcher on those trials, had a child, would you give that child leucovorin?\" Oz said he asked of researchers studying leucovorin. \"And when I asked the doctors on those trials, they said yes.\"",
      "Autism has become more prevalent in children born in the U.S. over the past 25 years,\u00a0according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but there is no scientific consensus as to why.",
      "Oz said that when he, Makary and Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health, were asked by the White House to examine the issue, they found two \"clues,\" not conclusions, that pointed to leucovorin as a possible treatment option for autistic children, and acetaminophen as a medication pregnant women should be cautious about taking.",
      "\"These are things that we believe, that if you're fully transparent about, you'll rebuild trust with the American people,\" Oz said. \"Just tell people what you know.\"",
      "Oz argued that Mr. Trump was right in pushing for the FDA to both approve leucovorin and make its Tylenol recommendation \u2014 even though there is no consensus in the medical community and no definitive evidence supporting either move \u2014 because he believes the FDA has an obligation to be transparent.",
      "But Oz was clear that patients should consult their doctors first before making a decision.",
      "\"The Tylenol issue is whether or not we should warn moms, who are pregnant today, about a problem that we may not know fully the answer to \u2014 'Is Tylenol a problem during pregnancy?' \u2014 for another five years,\" Oz said. \"Well, what about the kid today? Are you going to take the Tylenol or not. Well I think the answer is, the best prudent answer, of course take it if a doctor says you need it. But don't take it on your own without thinking twice about it.\"",
      "Oz also indicated that he would not advise a pregnant family member to take Tylenol without talking to their physician first.",
      "\"We're guarded in saying we don't have all the answers,\" he said. \"But if it's my family, I'm not going to have my pregnant daughter take acetaminophen if she doesn't need to be on it without certainly talking to a doctor about it.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 30 Sep 2025 20:11:39 -0400",
    "summary": "The interest in catastrophe bonds comes as insured property losses increased from $30 billion in 2015 to over $110 billion in 2024.",
    "story": [
      "In many communities at high risk for natural disasters, a Wall Street financing tool that's gaining popularity, called a catastrophe bond, may make it easier for homeowners to get insurance. On Oak Island, North Carolina, homeowners who face annual hurricane risk are seeing the impacts firsthand.",
      "The interest in catastrophe bonds comes as insured property losses increased from $30 billion in 2015 to over $110 billion in 2024, adjusted for inflation, the Insurance Information Institute found, while homeowner insurance premiums increased 40% faster than inflation between 2017 and 2022, according to the Consumer Federation of America. Many insurance companies have left high-risk markets altogether.",
      "Catastrophe bonds are contingent on whether or not a disaster takes place. Insurance companies sponsor bonds that are then purchased by investors, typically institutional investors. If a natural disaster does not take place, investors get a return on their investment. But if a disaster meeting certain thresholds takes place, money goes to insurance companies to pay out customers' claims, and investors lose money. Catastrophe bonds are beneficial to insurers because they make large amounts of capital available to pay insurance claims. The bonds are appealing to investors because disasters that lead to insurance payouts are rare.",
      "Catastrophe bonds cover a wide range of disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes and pandemics. But most catastrophe bonds have specific requirements on the degree of disaster before they are \"triggered\" to pay out to insurance companies. For instance, hurricanes may be required to reach a certain category of intensity, and floods may have to reach a certain height in order for investors to lose money. Many catastrophe bonds also require a certain amount of financial losses before they begin paying out.",
      "On Oak Island, a catastrophe bond sponsored by the North Carolina Insurance Underwriting Association is helping fund insurance and hurricane resilience projects. One such project is for local resident Paige Morgan's home, installing a fortified roof meant to withstand hurricanes and other extreme weather.",
      "\"If you're not prepared for something like this, you're taking a huge risk,\" she told CBS News. \"I've seen families lose their whole house, everything in it, with these last few storms\".",
      "Using catastrophe bonds to fund weather resilience upgrades is a new model for the industry. Gina Hardy, CEO of NCIUA, added a provision to her company's bond so that when investors profit, some of their proceeds go toward funding weather resilience upgrades like those on Morgan's home.",
      "\"When you put on a fortified roof, it reduces your probability of loss by 62%, so the more fortified roofs that we can get on, the less claims that we have,\" she said.",
      "For NCIUA, catastrophe bonds have become an important part of making sure insurance is affordable to its clients. NCIUA is North Carolina's insurer of last resort and has sponsored catastrophe bonds since 2009. Their catastrophe bonds have never been triggered, but if there were ever a severe disaster, the funding would be vital.",

    "published": "Tue, 30 Sep 2025 19:47:45 -0400",
    "summary": "Some people taking out a home loan and purchasing flood insurance could face delays if the U.S. government shuts down this week.",
    "story": [
      "Americans worried that a looming U.S.\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0could derail their plans to take out a mortgage or refinance their home loan can breathe easy \u2014 mostly. Housing experts says lenders will continue processing mortgages as usual even if federal agencies close shop, while noting that a shutdown could lead to hitches for borrowers applying for government-backed loans.",
      "\"If you're expecting to close in a week or a month, there could be some slight delay,\" said Jeff Ostrowski, a housing analyst at Bankrate. \"But I think for most people, it's probably going to be a blip more than a real deal killer.\"",
      "The bulk of the mortgage market consists of loans originated by private lenders. But some government agencies have a hand in the process, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insuring private loans or Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) managing flood insurance policies.",
      "Impact on government-backed loans",
      "Borrowers applying for a conventional mortgage issued by a bank, credit union or other private lender are unlikely to encounter problems if the government closes shop. However, those applying for government-backed loans from agencies like the FHA, Department of Veteran Affairs an Department of Agriculture (USDA) could face minor delays lining up their mortgages, Holden Lewis, a senior writer at NerdWallet, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The National Association of Realtors (NAR) notes in an online\u00a0explainer\u00a0that the FHA will continue to approve most single-family mortgage loans in the event of a shutdown. The VA will also continue to guarantee home loans, but worker furloughs at the agency could lead to processing delays, the group said.",
      "\"It creates a little bit of extra stress and uncertainty, but I haven't seen a shutdown in either of those programs\" when politics led the government to shut it doors in the past, Ostrowski said.",
      "The VA and FHA account for up to a quarter of all mortgage applications, according to\u00a0Redfin. NAR\u00a0advises\u00a0U.S. veterans applying for or refinancing a government-backed loan to check with their lender on how long it will take to complete the process if the government shuts down.",
      "Another segment of the housing market that could feel the impact of a shutdown are people applying for mortgages through the USDA, which issues loans to buyers in eligible towns and rural areas. NAR\u00a0said the USDA will halt issuance of new direct and guaranteed home loans during a shutdown. Pre-scheduled direct\u2011loan closings will also be postponed.",
      "The USDA did not respond to a request for comment. The VA referred CBS News to its shutdown contingency plan, which says the agency will continue issuing \"housing benefits.\"",
      "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored entities that support roughly 70% of the mortgage market, don't rely on federal funding and have continued to operate during past shutdowns. However, they could face bottlenecks if federal agencies close down this week, said Anthony Smith, an applied economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"They rely on other federal processes like the IRS for tax transcript verifications,\" he said. \"So if the IRS shuts down or significantly cuts back on its transcript services, then Fannie and Freddie might be able to approve a loan, but they can't get the final verification piece.\"",
      "Possible flood insurance delays",
      "People purchasing a house in a flood zone could also face delays during a government shutdown, experts told CBS News. That's because homebuyers applying for a federally backed mortgage in high-risk flood areas are required to get flood insurance. A shutdown could hamper the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program, which underwrites more than 4 million flood insurance policies in the U.S.",
      "\"The government shutdown could complicate your closing because it might be harder to just secure flood insurance,\" Ostrowski told CBS News.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "According to the White House, the flood insurance program cannot sell new or renewal insurance policies during a government shutdown.\"A potential lapse of the NFIP authorization would negatively impact many thousands of Americans who would be left unable to renew/transfer their coverage or to buy the required coverage for their homes,\" a White House official said in an email.",

    "summary": "A government shutdown could begin on Wednesday. Here's what to know about student loans, educational funding and the FAFSA.",
    "story": [
      "A government shutdown on Wednesday would have the potential to disrupt a multitude of federal activities \u2014 but people with student loans are expected to continue making their repayments, according to the U.S. Department of Education.",
      "People with student loans \"will still be required to make payments on their outstanding student debt,\" the Education Department said in a Sept. 28 contingency plan for an Oct. 1 federal shutdown.",
      "While loans are still due for repayment, it could be hard to reach someone at the Education Department if a problem arises given that most of its employees are scheduled to be furloughed in case of a shutdown, said Persis Yu, managing counsel at Protect Borrowers, an advocacy group for people with student loans.",
      "\"Student loan borrowers will still need to pay their bills during a shutdown,\" Yu told CBS News. \"However, if things go wrong with their servicer, which they often do, borrowers are going to have fewer people to turn to to get those errors resolved.\"",
      "There would also likely be little impact on federal aid, such as loans and grants, for students who are currently enrolled in colleges and university programs because most payments are disbursed at the start of the academic year, according to a statement from the American Council on Education, a higher-education advocacy group.",
      "Still, some borrowers and students in the applications stage could encounter hurdles during a shutdown, the group added.",
      "\"Borrowers seeking assistance from [the Education Department] may face delays, and loan forgiveness applications could be impacted if the shutdown persists,\" the American Council on Education said.",
      "The Education Department operates the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which is aimed at helping public workers \u2014 such as teachers and police officers \u2014 discharge their federal student loans after they've served in government or not-for-profit organizations for more than 10 years.",
      "The DOE also runs income-driven repayment plans that provide forgiveness after 20 - 25 years of repayment.",
      "About 2,100 of the Education Department's roughly 2,400 employees are expected to be furloughed if the government shuts down on Wednesday, according to the agency's contingency plan. Those include most of the agency's Office of Federal Student Aid, the plan shows.",
      "Could Pell Grants or the FAFSA be impacted?",
      "The Education Department said it would continue to disburse student aid such as Pell Grants and Federal Direct Student loans in the event of a shutdown because those programs are funded through mandatory spending or carryover appropriations, and therefore don't require approval from Congress.",
      "\"More than 9.9 million students receive student aid, in the form of grants and loans, at approximately 5,400 schools through these programs,\" the agency noted.",
      "The DOE said it plans to use permanent appropriations to continue processing student aid requests through the Free Applications for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, which opened on Sept. 24 for the 2026-27 academic year. The FAFSA is used by parents and students to apply for loans, grants and work-study funds to pay for college or career training programs.",
      "\"FAFSA applications actually opened early, with the form becoming fully available as of Sept. 24,\" rather than the traditional opening day of Oct. 1, NerdWallet lending expert Kate Wood told CBS News. \"Students shouldn't expect delays or for deadlines to be pushed back. Unless the Education Department says otherwise, there's no reason to wait to file the FAFSA.\"",
      "Funding for Title I and IDEA grants, which are for low-income schools and disabled students, respectively, would also continue to be available, it added.",
      "Likewise, most GI Bill benefits for students who are veterans should also continue without disruption if the government shuts down because the program is funded by mandatory spending that doesn't need to be re-approved by Congress, according to the American Council on Education, which cited the Department of Veterans Affairs' contingency plan.",
      "\"However, some delays [for ex-military students] could arise if the shutdown is prolonged or if students require additional verification, corrections or appeals during the lapse,\" the ACE noted.",
      "It added, \"In previous shutdowns, VA has experienced backlogs in claims processing and a slowdown in support services due to furloughed staff and reduced system capacity.\"",
      "What Education Department activities would be impacted?",
      "New grants would be halted during a government shutdown, the Education Department noted. But since most grants are awarded over the summer, only a small number of recipients would likely be impacted, it added.",
      "\"Grantees will continue to be able to draw down funds from these awards and, therefore, the impacts on schools and students should be minimal,\" the agency said. \"The Office for Civil Rights would pause its review and investigations of civil rights complaints.\"",

      "Known as the enhanced premium tax credit, the subsidy has been used by millions of low- and middle-class households since it was authorized under the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021. Since then, spurred by the tax credit, the number of people who have enrolled in ACA marketplace health insurance plans has almost doubled, according to health care publication KFF.",

      "Even as the outcome of the funding negotiations in Washington, D.C., remains uncertain, expiration of the premium health care credits could inflict financial pain on millions of Americans, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"Insurers are already preparing to send notices to households that they will see increases starting in January 2026,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy at Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal economic advocacy group, and former a White House economic official under former President Joe Biden, on a conference call Friday to discuss the tax credit.",

      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the enhanced ACA premium tax credits set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "How much could ACA premiums increase?",
      "The cost of premiums for people who buy their insurance through the ACA marketplaces could more than double, rising from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to a Sept. 30 analysis by KFF.\u00a0About 4 million people would likely drop their insurance coverage if the credit is allowed to expire because they would't be able to afford the costs, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The premium tax credit is aimed at people who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans, and who can't get affordable health care through an employer. The credit is available for those who earn between 100% to 400% of the poverty level, which means a family of four with annual income of up to $128,600 would qualify for the credit.",
      "With expiration of the ACA coverage credit only months away, some policy holders have already received noticed that their premiums \u2014 the monthly fee paid for insurance coverage \u2014 are poised to surge next year. Insurers have sent out notices in nearly every state, with some proposing premium increases of as much as 50%.",
      "Insurers are already planning on substantial premium hikes in 2026, according to a Peterson KFF Health System Tracker survey published last month. The poll found that 312 insurers participating in ACA marketplaces are proposing median increases of 18% next year, about 11 percentage points higher than in 2025.",
      "That increase would represent the largest rate hike since 2018, and is driven by higher costs for medical care as well as the expiration of the premium tax credits. Sharply higher ACA premiums would likely cause healthier people to drop coverage, making it more expensive to insure those who remain, the group said.",
      "The proposed hikes range from a high of 39.9%, from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma, to a low of 4.6% for Oscar Garden State Insurance Corporation, their survey found.",
      "In Iowa last month, the state's insurance commissioner weighed increases ranging from 3% to 37%, arousing public concerns. One woman who runs a garden center in Cedar Falls, Iowa, said she was considering dropping health insurance altogether.",
      "\"I am already living as frugally as I possibly can while working as hard as I possibly can, putting in as many hours as I am allowed to at my job, never missing a day of work,\" one woman, LuAnn, wrote in a comment published on the commissioner's website.",
      "Signs of financial fragility",
      "The potential hike in insurance costs comes as many Americans continue struggling with the cost of living, said Rohit Chopra, former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, on the conference call with Jacquez, organized by Groundwork, which supports extending the credits.",
      "\"Some people will need to drop their insurance all together, but households with someone with a chronic illness will have to pay those big, big increases,\" Chopra said. That would require some families to make tough financial choices, such as not paying other bills or accumulating debt to cover their expenses, he added.",
      "Although inflation around the U.S. has eased significantly since its post-pandemic peak in 2022, costs continue to inch higher. The Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target is slipping further from reach this year, with the Consumer Price Index climbing higher in recent months. Some consumers are showing signs of increasing financial stress, with credit card delinquencies on the rise and balances creeping higher.",

      "Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, who was in the Oval Office with the president for the announcement, said Mr. Trump's threat of 100% tariffs on drugs manufactured outside the U.S. motivated his company to take swift action. The president said Pfizer's drug prices will be lower starting \"immediately.\"",
      "The president said the cost of some Pfizer drugs could see decreases in price of 50%-100%. Mr. Trump said this would save American consumers and taxpayers \"hundreds of millions of dollars a year.\" The president said Americans have been \"subsidizing research and development costs for the entire planet\" because of the higher prices they have been paying.",

      "\"For years, other rich nations refused to pay their fair share for medical innovation,\" Bourla said. \"And as a result, Americans had to assume disproportionate costs.\"",
      "The Pfizer agreement is a part of the White House agenda to secure \"most favored nation\" pricing with pharmaceutical manufacturers. In May, Mr. Trump signed an executive order\u00a0calling on drugmakers to lower their prices and bring them in line with what other high-income countries pay for the same drugs.

      "The president's announcement comes days after he announced that on Wednesday, the U.S. would begin imposing a 100% tariff on any branded or patented pharmaceutical product \"unless a Company IS BUILDING their Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plant in America.\" That move could increase the costs of some drugs for consumers.",
      "Bourla mentioned the impending tariffs in his comments Tuesday, saying the tariffs had motivated his company. He said the Mr. Trump gave Pfizer a three-year grace period on the tariffs, and the tariffs would be inapplicable, as long as Pfizer manufactures in the U.S. As a part of the agreement, Bourla said Pfizer agreed to move their production of medicines used in America to the U.S.",
      "\"The president is absolutely right, tariff is the most powerful tool to motivate behaviors, Mr. President,\" Bourla said. \"And clearly motivated ours, right?\"",
      "Mr. Trump also said the tariffs had \"played a big role\" in the deal.",
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said more details of agreements by pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices will come this fall. Mr. Trump echoed that point, saying other companies are on board, too.",
      "\"President Trump is doing more to lower healthcare costs than anyone else in Washington, D.C.,\" said White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai ahead of the president's announcement. \"While Democrats are threatening to shut down the government to subsidize health care for illegal aliens, President Trump is leveraging the power of the federal government to drastically cut drug prices for everyday Americans. Democrats talked the talk for decades about drug prices, but only President Trump is actually walking the walk.\"",
      "Neither Pfizer nor the White House have released specific drug prices yet.",
      "The details of the \"TrumpRx\" website have not yet been shared, but a senior administration official expected the website to be live in early 2026.",
      "The announcement comes as Democrats remain at an impasse with the president and Republicans over keeping the government funded beyond midnight: they say the president is not doing enough to lower health care prices, and they've been pushing for an extension of the Affordable Care Act before premiums increase for many who have health care through the ACA.",

    "published": "Tue, 30 Sep 2025 11:15:44 -0400",
    "summary": "The U.S. government could shut down on Wednesday if Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even if a U.S.\u00a0government shutdown begins on Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress, with lawmakers currently at loggerheads over funding the federal government past Sept. 30.",
      "If an agreement isn't reached before then, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for their operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",
      "Benefit verificationsEarnings record corrections and updates unrelated to the adjudication of benefitsPayee accountingsPrisoner activities \u2014 suspensionRequests from third parties for queriesFreedom of Information Act requestsIT enhancement activities, public relations and trainingReplacement Medicare cardsOverpayments processing",

      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News.",

    "summary": "\"The last thing we want to do is just keep raising prices on our guests,\" Gregory's Coffee founder Gregory Zamfotis said. That might be easier said than done.",
    "story": [
      "The first Gregory's Coffee opened in 2006 on Manhattan's Park Avenue. Nineteen years later, the family-owned business has expanded to over 54 locations around the U.S. as well as a roastery in Queens, New York, that handles coffee beans from Brazil, Rwanda, Nicaragua and other major global producers.",
      "For Gregory Zamfotis, founder of the New York City-based chain, the business is about more than just dollars and cents \u2014 it's also about recognizing the special place coffee has long had in American culture as a driver of social connections.",
      "\"Coffee is built into the fabric of our society,\" Zamfotis told CBS News. \"People come together over coffee. When it's a meeting or interview, or we just want to get some work done, coffee tends to be the centerpiece of those conversations.\"",
      "With many Americans still feeling the effects of elevated inflation, for many coffee drinkers, one of those conversations is likely to center on the drink's soaring costs.",
      "Prices have leaped nearly 21% over the past 12 months, with the average retail price of 100% ground roast coffee recently reaching a record high of $8.87 per pound, up from $7.02 in January, USDA data shows.",
      "Several factors are behind the spike in coffee prices, including droughts in Brazil and volatile weather in other regions where the bean is cultivated. More recently, heavy U.S. tariffs on coffee-producing countries \u2014 including a hefty 50% levy on Brazil \u2014 have also driven up prices.",
      "Though coffee is a staple of American daily life, the vast majority of the beans is imported. Much of that is sourced from Latin America, with Brazil alone accounting for 35%, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "By contrast, the U.S. produces relatively little coffee compared to the rest of the world. Hawaii, the top-producing state, harvested 21 million pounds during the 2024\u201325 season, according to the USDA. Yet Americans consumed a whopping 3.3 billion pounds of coffee during the same period, the agency said.",
      "\"Prices are going to have to go up\"",
      "Jake Leonti, director of coffee at Gregory's Coffee, said it's also far pricier to grow and produce coffee in the U.S.",
      "\"It's exponentially [more] expensive because it's Americans farming,\" he said. \"Whereas we can get super high-quality coffee from different parts of the world at a price that's much more friendly to the consumer.\"",
      "Gregory's Coffee has not raised prices yet despite the jump in costs. But Leonti said that could change soon.",
      "\"Prices are going to have to go up \u2014 there's no other way around it,\" he said. \"We're seeing tariffs from the places where we get our bags printed as well. So everything around the coffee business is getting tariffs at some point.\"",
      "Like other retailers, Gregory's prices vary depending on where a store is located, reflecting regional labor and other costs. In New York City, the chain charges $3.45 for a regular cup of coffee, while at its New Jersey and Washington, D.C., outlets the same item runs $3.15.",
      "Other retailers are also preparing for increased coffee costs. Mark Smucker, CEO of The J.M. Smucker Co., whose portfolio includes the Folgers Coffee, Caf\u00e9 Bustelo and Dunkin' at-home brands, said during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call in June that prices will likely increase for a third time this year \"due to higher green coffee costs.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Starbucks Chief Financial Officer Catherine R. Smith said during the company's third-quarter earnings call in July that, due to the company's coffee buying and hedging practices, customers shouldn't expect price increases until the first half of fiscal 2026.",
      "At Gregory's Coffee, \"The last thing we want to do is just keep raising prices on our guests,\" Zamfotis said. \"We're hoping that if prices go up a few pennies across the board, that doesn't turn off our everyday customers.

      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies would be expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even if lawmakers fail this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "Barring a deal in Congress, a shutdown would begin at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Labor said it would delay releases of economic data if the federal government shuts down\u00a0this week, which could postpone Friday's highly anticipated monthly jobs report.",
      "On Friday, the Labor Department posted a 73-page \"contingency plan\" detailing operations if government funding lapses at midnight on Sept. 30. If that occurs, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) would suspend all operations, including data collection activities for BLS surveys, website updates and economic reports, the plan states.",
      "The BLS is scheduled to release its report on September employment gains on Oct. 3. In a shutdown, government agencies must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded from other sources, such as fees, or under other legislation.",
      "The BLS' closely watched monthly jobs report drew scrutiny last month when President Trump\u00a0fired its commissioner of labor statistics after disappointing employment numbers. At the same time, the Federal Reserve has signaled it is closely watching the labor market for signs of weakness amid a hiring slowdown.",
      "Awkward timing",
      "Earlier this month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited headwinds facing the labor market as a key factor in the central bank's vote for an\u00a0interest rate cut\u00a0earlier this month.",
      "\"The timing of the looming potential government shutdown is not ideal for the Fed, which is set to meet again on October 29th,\" said Mike Reid, senior U.S. economist at the Royal Bank of Canada, in a research report.",
      "Although it's unclear whether a shutdown will occur or how long it could last, the possibility raises the risk that some government economic reports would not be available to the Fed before its next meeting on Oct. 29, he added.",
      "\"In our view, an increasingly data dependent Federal Reserve with limited visibility into the September data increases the probability of an October pause,\" meaning that the Fed could hold off on an additional rate cut at the Oct. 29 meeting, Reid\u00a0wrote.",
      "Earlier this month, the BLS reported that\u00a0employers added 22,000 jobs in August, falling short of economists' forecasts. The September report, scheduled for Friday, is expected to show about 50,500 new hires, according to economists polled by FactSet.",
      "\"We believe that a shutdown will have only a small and transitory economic impact, but it may spur some financial market volatility, especially if delays in government economic reports obscure the path of Federal Reserve's interest-rate cuts,\" said Jennifer Timmerman, investment strategy analyst, in a Wells Fargo Investment Institute\u00a0report\u00a0released Monday.",

    "published": "Mon, 29 Sep 2025 13:17:33 -0400",
    "summary": "While the tariffs will impact everyone to some degree, experts say more of the pain will be felt by lower-income consumers.",
    "story": [
      "Fresh tariffs on upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities recently announced by President Trump on social media\u00a0could cause already high prices to rise even further, and deter some Americans from embarking on home renovation projects.",
      "Mr. Trump on Thursday said his administration will levy a 50% tariff on all imported kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and \"associated products,\" plus a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture from abroad.",
      "Preventing what he called the \"flooding\" of such goods into the U.S. is a matter of national security, the president added. Both sets of tariffs will kick in Oct. 1, he said. \"It is a very unfair practice, but we must protect, for National Security and other reasons, our Manufacturing process,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "Prices for living room, kitchen and dining room furniture \u2014 much of which is imported \u2014 rose 9.5% from August 2024 to August 2025,\u00a0the latest CPI data shows, driven by Mr. Trump's country-based tariffs, according to economists.\u00a0Furniture and bedding also rose 4.7% over the same period, and 2.8% for household furnishings and supplies.",
      "If the new levies go into effect, furniture makers will feel the hit, and some will likely pass the costs on to consumers, industry analysts told CBS News. The sectoral tariffs could also hinder business activity and growth, they added, as companies wait to see if tariff policies change and defer investment decisions.",
      "\"Higher prices are an inevitable consequence of these tariffs,\" Zak Stambor, a retail analyst at market research company eMarketer, told CBS News. \"People undergoing bathroom or kitchen renovations are in a tough spot right now because there was so little warning. The costs of those things will now be higher, and people might not have already bought them because they were waiting for permits.\"",
      "Low-income consumers will feel the squeeze the most, not just because they have less discretionary income but because lower-cost furniture sold in the U.S. tends to be imported from Southeast Asian countries such as Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Malaysia and India.",
      "Some higher-end furniture is manufactured in the U.S., and therefore less exposed to tariffs, according to Telsey Advisory Group managing director and senior retail analyst Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez. She said retailers will have no choice but to raise prices on imported goods once the tariffs take effect.",
      "\"They are trying not to raise prices too much ahead of holiday season. But they can't absorb 30% tariffs on top of other tariffs that are already in place,\" she told CBS News. \"They'll have to pass through pricing, probably in the form of a double-digit price increase.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to CBS News's request for comment on analysts' claims the tariffs could drive up prices or inhibit business investment.",
      "Uncertainty persists",
      "From retailers' point of view, the levies could make investing in new inventory a riskier and more difficult proposition, according to Stambor, as costs and consumer demand could shift.",
      "\"Retailers' only certainty is that uncertainty is here to stay. What's true today very well may not be true tomorrow and that makes life incredibly challenging,\" he said.",
      "Naturepedic, an Ohio-based maker of organic mattresses and bedroom furniture, said it had been planning to launch an upholstered product line in late 2025 or early 2026, including headboards. However, as of Thursday, it is reconsidering that expansion.",
      "\"We are having to go back to the drawing board a little bit,\" Naturepedic Chief Growth Officer Arin Schultz told CBS News. \"We might drop it if it doesn't make sense, even though we're pretty far along in the process.\"",
      "Of the tariffs announced on Thursday, he said, \"If they could turn around and not do it, that would be great.\"",
      "Cost to consumers",
      "John Mercer, head of global research at Coresight Research, a provider of retail industry insights, doesn't expect all manufacturers to pass on all tariff-related costs to the consumer, and says some will likely take steps to mitigate the impact.",
      "Firms with larger inventories will be able to sell through what they have in stock before implementing any price hikes, while on-demand furniture makers may have to raise prices sooner, rather than later, he said.",
      "Mr. Trump has promoted tariffs as a way of reducing trade deficits with other nations and bolstering domestic jobs in manufacturing.",
      "Mercer, however, doesn't expect the levies to compel makers of upholstered furniture and cabinetry to quickly move production to the U.S.",
      "\"Generally, that's not easy, and it's more expensive,\" he said. \"There is a reason why companies have offshored production, and that's because because it's traditionally much cheaper.\"",

      "According to a Saturday notice published by the Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service, the recall covers select State Fair corn dogs and Jimmy Dean \"Pancakes & Sausage On a Stick\" and \"French Toast & Sausage On a Stick\" products from Texas-based Hillshire Brands, which is a subsidiary of Tyson Foods.",
      "The contamination problem was discovered after Hillshire received multiple consumer complaints, the service notes, five of which involved injuries. The company later determined that a \"limited number\" of these products included \"extraneous pieces of wooden stick within the batter,\" Tyson said in a corresponding announcement, adding that it opted to initiate a recall \"out of an abundance of caution.\"",
      "The recalled corn dogs and sausage-on-a-stick goods were produced between March 17 and as recently as Friday, per Saturday's recall notices. Tyson, which is headquartered in Arkansas, said the issue was isolated to one facility located in Haltom City, Texas.",
      "FSIS is worried that some of these recalled products may be in consumers' refrigerators and freezers in households across the U.S., as well as some schools and other institutions. In addition to being sold online and to retailers nationwide, the agency noted Saturday, these products were also sold to school districts and Defense Department facilities.",
      "Consumers in possession of the recalled items are urged to throw them away or return them to their place of purchase.",
      "To determine which corn dogs and other sausage goods are subject to this recall, consumers should check the product's name, use-by dates and other identifying information published online by the FSIS and Tyson. The products being recalled should also have an establishment number of \"EST-582\" or \"P-894\" printed on the packaging.",
      "It's unclear if consumers who purchased these now-recalled products will be eligible for a refund. The FSIS says consumers with questions about the recall can contact Christina Self, The Hillshire Brands Company Associate Director of Customer Care, at 888-747-7611.",
      "Foreign object contamination is one of the top reasons for food recalls in the U.S. Beyond plastic, metal fragments, bits of bugs and more \"extraneous\" materials have prompted recalls by making their way into packaged goods.",

    "story": [
      "On Sept. 29, 1916, it was front page news that a surge in Standard Oil's stock price likely made oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller America's first billionaire.",
      "More than a century later, the United States is home to hundreds of billionaires whose fortunes increasingly come from technology and financial markets. Together, they control a growing share of the country's wealth \u2014 approaching the percentage held by Gilded Age industrialists who built monopolies in railroads, oil and steel.",
      "Here's what research tells us about America's billionaire class today.",
      "American billionaires number over 900, according to researchers",
      "There are a few different estimates of the number of American billionaires, but researchers tend to agree that the billionaire class exceeds 900 and is growing.",
      "Forbes, which has produced a list of billionaires since the 1980s, counted roughly 900 in early 2025 \u2014 up from 813 in 2024.",
      "Meanwhile, the wealth-data firm Altrata pinned the number of U.S. billionaires at 1,135 in 2024, an uptick from 1,050 in 2023 and up more than 80% from levels in 2016, when they began releasing yearly reports.",
      "And JP Morgan Chase Private Bank estimated the number at roughly 1,990 in 2024 \u2014 about 15% more than its 2023 estimate.",
      "Part of the reason estimates vary is that the ultra-wealthy are not required or incentivized to disclose their net worth. The SEC requires investors to report ownership of more than 5% of a company's shares, but valuations fluctuate with the market, complicating wealth estimates.",
      "Adjusted for inflation, the number of billionaires with a Rockefeller-sized fortune is a much smaller set.",
      "His $1 billion in 1916 would be worth roughly $30 billion today. By that measure, only about 30 American billionaires have a similar fortune, according to Forbes and\u00a0Bloomberg. Among them are Oracle founder Larry Ellison and Tesla founder Elon Musk, with net worths above $300 billion. Other tech titans also top the list, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos \u2014 both with fortunes of over $200 billion each, as of Sept. 29.",
      "Christopher Nichols, a professor of history at Ohio State University said, \"The billionaires of the Gilded Age and the multimillionaires were involved in what we think of as blue chip industries, where there are lots of jobs and stuff produced. The billionaires of today's world are mostly working in tech sectors and places that very often don't employ many people.\"",
      "Billionaires have roughly $6.8 trillion in wealth in 2025",
      "Together, America's billionaires had an approximate total net worth of $6.8 trillion in the spring of 2025, Forbes estimates, which is a jump of more than a trillion compared to last year after a strong year of growth for U.S. stocks in 2024.",
      "In the 20th century, Scottish journalist B.C. Forbes, who founded the eponymous magazine, wrote that if Rockefeller's wealth \"could be turned into cash and distributed equally\u2014which it couldn't\u2014[it] would give every man, woman and child in the United States $10 each.\"",
      "Today, if that estimated $6.8 trillion held by U.S. billionaires could be turned into cash and divided equally among roughly 340 million Americans, it would amount to about $20,000 per person.",
      "Another way to think about that sum is that it could theoretically be used to buy every NFL team, pay off Americans' student loan and medical debt\u00a0and purchase 9 million homes at the current median sales price, with hundreds of billions left over.",
      "The ultra rich own an increasingly large share of the nation's wealth",
      "Data from the World Inequality Database shows that the share of wealth held by the top 1% and the ultra-rich top 0.001% has been rising for decades \u2014 toward the record levels observed in the Gilded Age.",
      "The share of the national wealth held by the top 1% peaked at nearly 50% in 1929 before tumbling during the Great Depression, according to the data.",
      "\"What happened with the Great Depression was that large fortunes were lost in the stock market. And then the New Deal rebuilt the economy around workers and around small businesses,\" said Jeremi Suri, a professor of history and public affairs at University of Texas.",
      "But in the early 1980s, the top 1% began regaining ground, as union jobs declined and traditional industries like manufacturing shrunk, according to Suri.",
      "By 2023 the top 1%, or those with over $4.6 million in assets, controlled more than a third of the nation's wealth \u2014 up over 10 percentage points from 1980.",
      "Data collected by the same researchers shows that the trendline looks similar for those in the top 0.001% of people in the country \u2014 or those who owned more than $1.5 billion in 2023.",
      "The hundreds of billionaires in this category owned about 1% of the nation's net wealth in 1980 and 5% in 2023.",
      "Most billionaires are males with self-made fortunes, but a significant number inherited their money",
      "Demographically, the billionaire class still resembles J.D. Rockefeller in many ways.",
      "The vast majority of the world's billionaires are men \u2014 about 86.5% in 2025, according to Forbes \u2014 and most make rather than inherit their wealth.",
      "Rockefeller himself was the son of a traveling salesman and a housewife. While his family helped him launch his career, Rockefeller built the majority of his fortune on his own, according to Nichols, an editor of \"A Companion to the Gilded Age and Progressive Era.\"",
      "\"He came from enough middle class wealth that he could get a loan from his dad to start that business, which so often is the story for business folks,\" Nichols said. \"But he made his billions through his business acumen and hard work, and then also his ruthless competitiveness in an under-regulated time.\"",
      "Research suggests inheritance plays a significant role for many wealthy people today. Roughly 30% of the world's billionaires have inherited their fortunes, according to a 2024 report by UBS, a wealth management company in Sweden. And the share in the U.S. is about a third, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Altrata data.",

      "Palmer has no regrets about his decision to forego college and instead establish himself as a tradesman. \"I am very happy doing what I am doing now because it has given me the opportunity to work for myself and be independent,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Experts say the skilled trades \u2014 jobs like electricians, plumbers, welders, masons, HVAC technicians and other occupations requiring extensive training and often licensing \u2014 are attracting a growing number of young people put off by high tuition costs.",
      "More than 57% of Gen Zers surveyed by Jobber, a software tool for service businesses, cite student loan debt as a concern about going to college, according to the company's annual report on attitudes toward blue-collar jobs.",
      "More recently, signs that\u00a0artificial intelligence is starting to gobble up the kind of entry-level jobs that once went to young college graduates are also leading young workers to consider the trades. Some 77% of Gen Zers say it's important that their future job is hard to automate, with many pointing to professions like carpenter, plumber, and electrician as occupations they believe are safe from automation. By contrast, they see less security in fields like software development, data analytics, and accounting, according to the survey.",
      "\"That route is losing some of the stigma,\" said David Asay, president of Advantage Reline, a trenchless pipe rehabilitation company in Mesa, Arizona. \"The perception among that younger group is no longer, 'Oh, you're working construction, you didn't go to school?' It's, 'What a cool skillset. You're making a good career path.'\"",

      "\"The attitude was that jobs in the trades were less than desirable,\" said Angie Hicks, co-founder of Angi, an online home improvement services guide told CBS News.",
      "But several factors are contributing to a shift in how people are thinking about such occupations. For one, going to college for many Americans often requires going into debt. The average cost of college, including tuition and room and board, now tops\u00a0$38,000 a year and is approaching $60,000 for private institutions, according to the Education Data Initiative.",

      "More recently, economists also point to a jump in unemployment for recent college grads, which some experts say is an early warning sign that AI is taking jobs away from less experienced workers.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/government-shutdown-september-2025-economic-impact-social-security-tsa/",
    "published": "Mon, 29 Sep 2025 09:12:41 -0400",
    "summary": "The economic impact of a government shutdown depends on its duration, economists say. Some payments, like Social Security, would continue to be issued.",
    "story": [
      "A government shutdown could begin on Wednesday, halting pay for hundreds of thousands of federal workers and delaying services, as lawmakers remain deadlocked over funding past Sept. 30.",
      "The financial impact of a shutdown typically depends on the length of the disruption, with each week costing the U.S. economy about $7 billion, according to a new analysis from EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco. A suspension could also weigh on investor and consumer confidence at a time when the U.S. economy is already facing headwinds, he told CBS News.",
      "Government shutdowns aren't new: The U.S. has experienced 14 of them since 1980, with the longest occurring over 34 days from December 2018 into January 2019, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. They're triggered when Congress fails to pass a full-year spending bill or a continuing resolution to fund the government for the pending fiscal year, which begins on Wednesday. Oct. 1.",
      "\"We've been to this picnic before, unfortunately,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at Pacific Research Institute, told CBS News. Pacific Research is a think tank that focuses on free trade.",
      "\"In general, things like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, those will continue to go out, and we'll continue to pay interest on the debt,\" Winegarden said.",
      "But, he added, \"The general rule is that the longer it goes on, the bigger the disruption.\"",
      "What happens if there is a government shutdown?",
      "Without congressional approval for new spending, federal agencies are typically prohibited from doling out money. Activities at many agencies will be suspended until lawmakers agree on a new funding bill, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers likely to be furloughed during that time.",
      "Yet because the government must continue to provide services that protect life and property, agencies will determine which essential workers must continue working, although they won't receive pay until lawmakers resolve the funding gap. Federal agencies develop plans ahead of a shutdown to determine which employees will remain working.",
      "For instance, the Department of Health and Human Services posted its shutdown plan on Sept. 25, which states that more than 32,000 employees, or about 41% of the agency's workforce, will be furloughed. The other employees are either funded through sources other than annual appropriations or will continue to work, although without pay, because they are in essential roles.",
      "And while federal employees would eventually receive back pay, others could experience financial strain while their paychecks are suspended, Daco noted.",
      "During the shutdown of 2018-2019, about 800,000 government workers missed several weeks of pay, creating financial hardships for many. Some turned to online fundraising campaigns for assistance, while others relied on food banks to help them get through the period.",
      "Government shutdowns have typically been short, with the pay of military service persons often seen as a deadline for getting funding restored, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report. The next military pay date at risk from a shutdown would be Oct. 15, they noted.",
      "\"For civilian employees, the first pay date at risk would be Oct. 10 but this is less likely to drive a compromise,\" the analysts noted.",
      "What is the economic impact of a government shutdown?",
      "While the biggest direct hit would be on government workers, followed by federal contractors who would also be shut off from funding, delayed federal procurement on goods and services could also ripple through the broader economy, Daco told CBS News.",
      "A shutdown could also undermine confidence in the economy at a time when some sectors, such as the labor market, are facing headwinds, he added. Markets could be rattled by the disruption, as well as consumer sentiment, some economists noted.",
      "\"We need more certainty in the rules of the game of the economy,\" Winegarden said. \"Uncertainty, at this moment, is the last thing we need.\"",
      "A halt in government functions could also complicate monetary policy decisions, potentially resulting in delays for key economic data next month, such as the Oct. 3 jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. With the labor market stalling out over the summer, Federal Reserve officials are expected to closely scrutinize the latest jobs data when they make their next rate decision at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.",
      "\"A government shutdown at this economic juncture represent a graver risk than when the economy is running at full steam,\" Daco said.",
      "Would Social Security benefits be impacted?",
      "Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are covered by mandatory spending, which means that funding for these programs has been approved by Congress to continue without an expiration date.",
      "Social Security benefits would be paid on time, while health care payments for seniors in Medicare and low- and middle-income Americans enrolled in Medicaid would continue.",
      "However, Social Security's administrative budget needs to receive approval from Congress, which means that some of its services could be impacted in a shutdown, some experts note.",
      "\"In the event of a government shutdown ... customer service at the Social Security Administration may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing and replacing Medicare cards,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in a Friday email.",
      "Would other federal functions like the TSA be impacted?",
      "Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration agents would be required to work without pay because they provide essential services.",
      "Unlike other government agencies. the U.S. Postal Service operates as a self-funded, independent agency. That means mail, packages and other shipments would still be delivered and post offices would remain open in the event of a shutdown.",
      "But there could be other impacts for consumers and businesses. For one, some mortgage processing could face delays because the flood insurance program would be closed to new policies until Congress agrees to a new spending deal, according to TD Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg.",
      "\"That means no mortgages which require federal flood insurance will be originated,\" he noted.",
      "In previous shutdowns, other services were also suspended, such as the Food and Drug Administration's inspections, as well as the entry to the National Parks, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.",

    "published": "Mon, 29 Sep 2025 05:00:16 -0400",
    "summary": "Under a new law, many Americans will have to meet a work requirement to obtain and keep their Medicaid coverage. But due to an exemption, millions living in areas of high unemployment could be spared.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of Medicaid enrollees may have a way out of the new federal work requirement \u2014 if they live in a county with high unemployment.",
      "By January 2027, President Trump's far-reaching domestic policy law will require many adult, nondisabled Medicaid enrollees in 42 states and Washington, D.C., to work or volunteer 80 hours a month or go to school.",
      "But under the law, Medicaid enrollees in counties where unemployment is at least 8% or 1.5 times the national unemployment rate could be shielded from the work requirement, if their state applies for an exemption.",
      "A new analysis by KFF shows that exemption in the GOP's work requirement could offer a reprieve to potentially millions of Americans caught in a tough spot \u2014 needing to work to secure health insurance but having trouble finding a job.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office projected the work requirement would apply to 18.5 million Medicaid enrollees, causing about 5.3 million to lose their government health coverage by 2034. CBO spokesperson Caitlin Emma confirmed to KFF Health News that analysts factored the unemployment rate exemption into their projections. Only states that expanded Medicaid under the 2010 Affordable Care Act or a special waiver must enact a work requirement, under the federal law.",
      "But how many people could be exempt depends on how the Trump administration interprets the law, in addition to whether their states' officials apply.",
      "For example, if Trump officials exempt people in counties where the unemployment rate has been above the law's thresholds for any month over a 12-month period, about 4.6 million Medicaid enrollees in 386 counties could qualify for an exemption today based on the latest unemployment data, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "That amounts to just under a quarter of all Medicaid enrollees subject to the work requirement.",
      "Under that one-month threshold, \"the impact could be fairly significant,\" said Jennifer Tolbert, a co-author of the analysis and the deputy director of KFF's Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured.",
      "But, she said, the Trump administration is more likely to adopt a stricter threshold based on average unemployment over a 12-month period. That would align with work requirements under the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the food assistance commonly known as food stamps.",
      "Only about 1.4 million Medicaid enrollees living in 158 counties could be exempted under that standard, or about 7% of the total subject to work requirements, KFF found. That's about 7% of enrollees who live in expansion states who would otherwise need to meet the new requirement.",
      "Based on the 12-month criteria, about 90% of Medicaid enrollees who could be exempted based on high unemployment reside in five states, according to KFF: California, New York, Michigan, Kentucky, and Ohio. California alone accounts for over half of those who could be exempted.",
      "The unemployment rate exemption is one of several carve-outs from the Medicaid work requirement in the GOP's law. The law also exempts parents with children under 14, people who are disabled or frail, and those who are pregnant, incarcerated, or in a substance use disorder program, among others. The high unemployment provision is different than most because it exempts people living in entire counties.",
      "Two top Republicans key to the bill's passage \u2014 House Speaker Mike Johnson and Sen. Mike Crapo, chair of the Senate Finance Committee \u2014 did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "To qualify for the Medicaid exemption, states would have to apply to the federal government on behalf of individuals in eligible counties. And if a county earned an exemption, the government would determine how long it applies.",
      "Even if the federal government grants exemptions broadly, health advocates fear some Republican-led states could balk at applying for exemptions in order to keep enrollment down, as they say has been the case with SNAP exemptions. As of 2023, 18 states did not have an exemption under the SNAP program, even though some of their residents might be eligible.",
      "\"It's not a guarantee that people can rely on,\" said Emily Beauregard, executive director of Kentucky Voices for Health, an advocacy group that intends to push for the broadest possible exemptions to help people maintain their coverage. Eastern Kentucky has several counties with perennially high unemployment.",
      "In advocating for Mr. Trump's bill, many Republicans in Washington argued that most people who gained Medicaid benefits under the Affordable Care Act should be working to get off of government assistance.",
      "But as Georgia's and Arkansas' experiences have shown, Medicaid work requirements can be costly for states to run and frustrating for enrollees to navigate. About 18,000 people in Arkansas, or nearly a quarter of the state's adults who gained Medicaid coverage through the ACA expansion, lost coverage when the state had a work requirement in 2018 and 2019. A court ended the state's work requirement program.",
      "Critics point out that most Medicaid enrollees already work or have a disability or caregiving responsibilities, and they argue the reporting requirements merely serve as a bureaucratic hurdle to obtaining and keeping coverage. Under the GOP law, enrollees' work status needs to be verified at least twice a year.",
      "Most of the coverage losses due to work requirements occur among people who work or should qualify for an exemption but nevertheless lose coverage due to red tape, research shows.",
      "Not every state must implement a work requirement under Mr. Trump's law, only those that chose to expand Medicaid coverage to more low-income people through the ACA or a federal waiver. The ACA has provided hundreds of billions in federal dollars to help states cover everyone making up to 138% of the federal poverty level \u2014 $21,597 for an individual in 2025.",
      "Forty states and Washington, D.C., took up the expansion. Georgia and Wisconsin partly expanded their Medicaid eligibility by getting a federal waiver, adding them to the list of states subject to the work requirement. These two states were not included in the KFF analysis because of a lack of county-level enrollment data.",
      "Jennifer Wagner, director of Medicaid eligibility and enrollment at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said she is pleased the law makes some exceptions for places where jobs are scarce. It could limit how many people lose coverage because of the work requirement, she said.",
      "Wagner said SNAP's unemployment rate exemption has helped millions of people avoid losing their food assistance, but its impact also depends on whether a state seeks the waiver.",
      "She is concerned the Trump administration may make it difficult for counties to get exempted under the Medicaid law.",
      "\"I'm glad it's in there as it will certainly help people, but it's still a terrible bill,\" she said. \"This will not really blunt the harm of the bill.\"",

The products contain the establishment number \"P- 45288\" inside the USDA mark of inspection. The stores possibly affected are in Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah, Trader Joe's said Friday.",
      "The affected meals from Walmart contain the establishment numbers \"EST. 50784\" and \"EST. 47718\" inside the USDA mark of inspection on the label. They were sent to Walmart stores nationwide.",
      "\"The health and safety of our customers is always a top priority. We have removed this product from our impacted stores and we are working with the supplier to investigate,\" a Walmart spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News on Friday.",
      "There have been no reported illness complaints for the product in question and consumers should discard the meals if they have them and can receive a full refund at any Walmart store. Trader Joe's told customers to discard the product or return it to their local store for a full refund.",
      "\"We are issuing this guidance in an abundance of caution because testing of another brand with a shared ingredient source indicated this product may have the potential to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes,\" Trader Joe's said on its website. \"There have been no positive Listeria tests for the Trader Joe's product itself, and there have been no reports of illness associated with these production codes.\"",
      "No recall has been issued, but FreshRealm, a large food producer that distributed the products, said they advised Walmart this week to pull the meals from store shelves. Additional products may be identified, according to the FSIS.",
      "The meals may be contaminated with the same strain of listeria that caused an outbreak tied to chicken fettuccine Alfredo meals sold at Walmart and Kroger stores.\u00a0Four people were killed and at least 20 were sickened in the outbreak, which federal health officials updated on Friday evening. The outbreak led to a large recall this summer.",
      "\"FreshRealm held beef meatball marinara linguine meals after they tested positive for the outbreak strain,\" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0said in its update Friday. \"Pasta that went into the beef meatball marinara linguine meals has tested positive for Listeria, but additional information is pending to determine if the samples taken from the pre-cooked pasta is the same strain making people sick. Do not eat affected foods, return them or throw them out.\"",

      "A pair of e-commerce entrepreneurs who bought a number of well-known retail brands \u2014 including RadioShack, Modell's Sporting Goods and Pier 1 Imports \u2014 out of bankruptcy are accused of running a Ponzi scheme.",
      "The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday accused Alex Mehr and Tai Lopez, founders of the Miami-based Retail Ecommerce Ventures (REV), of defrauding investors out of approximately $112 million.",
      "Through their holding company, Mehr and Lopez acquired distressed brick-and-mortar companies in order to turn them into successful, online-only brands. Dress Barn and Linens 'n Things were also among their acquisitions.",

In 2023, Unicomer Group acquired RadioShack, and in 2024, relaunched it as an e-commerce platform. RadioShack's current owners are not named in the lawsuit.",
      "Modell's Sporting Goods filed for bankruptcy in March 2020, when it also announced it would be closing all of its stores. REV bought the Modell's brand name and assets in August 2020. Pier 1 Imports \u2014 which still exists as an online store \u2014 declared bankruptcy in early 2020. REV acquired its trademark name and assets later that same year.",
      "The SEC's suit alleges that between 2020 and 2022, Mehr and Lopez, \"made material misrepresentations\" to hundreds of investors about the bankrupt retailers they had acquired. For example, to entice individuals to invest in their acquisitions, they said their portfolio companies were \"on fire\" and that \"cash flow is strong.\" They also told prospective backers that money raised for a company would only be invested in that specific firm. That proved not to be the case, according to the SEC's lawsuit, which was filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.",
      "\"Contrary to these representations, while some of the REV Retailer Brands generated revenue, none generated any profits,\" the suit states. \"Consequently, in order to pay interest, dividends and maturing note payments, Defendants resorted to using a combination of loans from outside lenders, merchant cash advances, money raised from new and existing investors, and transfers from other portfolio companies to cover obligations.\"",

      "After 85 years of sending out paper checks to retirees, the Social Security Administration (SSA) is transitioning to electronic payments in what it says is an effort to modernize its services and improve efficiency.",
      "Starting Sept. 30, the SSA will no longer issue paper checks to its nearly 70 million recipients, instead sending benefits through either direct deposit or a prepaid debit card.",
      "\"We have been communicating directly with beneficiaries since July 1, and we have worked diligently to ensure that the less than one percent of individuals who receive paper checks have ample time to enroll in direct deposit or receive Direct Express cards,\" a Social Security spokesperson told CBS News in an email on Tuesday.",
      "\"By moving to electronic payments exclusively, we aim to improve efficiency, security, and ensure beneficiaries receive their monthly benefits promptly,\" they added.",
      "The Social Security Administration has emphasized that electronic payments provide a safer and more secure way to receive benefits compared with paper checks, which the agency says are 16 times more likely to be lost or stolen. Eliminating paper checks is also a cost-saving measure: Checks cost 50 cents each, compared with 15 cents for an electronic funds transfer.",
      "In an online post, the SSA said it was sending notices to people who receive paper checks to alert them of the change. The agency encouraged paper check recipients to switch to the new payment options before the deadline to ensure they receive their benefits in a timely fashion.",
      "The Social Security spokesperson declined to comment on how people were contacted or on the current status of its outreach.",
      "Exceptions for some paper checks",
      "While the agency is pulling away from paper checks, there are some exceptions. The spokesperson confirmed to CBS News that the agency will continue to issue paper checks to people who have no other way to receive payments, echoing what it\u00a0told CBS News\u00a0in July after it announced the move to electronic payments.",
      "\"The U.S. Department of the Treasury will grant exceptions to the rule for qualifying circumstances,\" the spokesperson said, without elaborating on what the qualifying circumstances are or the steps Social Security recipients would need to take to establish they qualify.",
      "President Trump set the shift away from paper checks in motion with a March executive order that mandated all federal payments be digitized. Paper-based checks, the White House said at the time, impose \"unnecessary costs; delays; and risks of fraud, lost payments, theft, and inefficiencies.\"",
      "Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, as well as advocates for seniors have noted that the roughly 600,000 people who rely on the SSA's original payment system often need paper checks because they're unable to receive electronic deposits.",
      "That includes people who are \"unbanked,\" or those who lack access to traditional bank accounts. According to an August report from Bankrate, the unbanked represent 4.6% of the U.S. population, and tend to rely more on check-cashing services and other alternative forms of payment to manage their finances.",
      "While the Social Security Act was signed into law in 1935 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, it wasn't until\u00a01940\u00a0that the agency began sending paper checks to retired workers and their dependents as well as to survivors of deceased insured workers. The first recipient of the monthly benefit was a woman named Ida M. Fuller.",
      "A Vermont native, Fuller worked as a teacher before becoming a legal secretary.

    "summary": "A judge gave a blistering assessment of the Trump administration's efforts to go after international students who expressed pro-Palestinian views on college campuses.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Massachusetts ruled Tuesday that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio violated the First Amendment by targeting pro-Palestinian students for deportation in order to strike fear into international students and curb lawful speech.",
      "In a 161-page decision, U.S. District Judge William Young delivered a blistering assessment of the Trump administration's efforts to pursue international students who expressed pro-Palestinian views on college campuses, which he said was constitutionally protected speech.",
      "The judge, appointed by former President Ronald Reagan, was unsparing not only in his views of Noem and Rubio's actions, but also of President Trump, who he said approves of \"truly scandalous and unconstitutional suppression of free speech\" on the part of two senior administration officials.",
      "\"The president's palpable misunderstanding that the government simply cannot seek retribution for speech he disdains poses a great threat to Americans' freedom of speech,\" he wrote.",
      "Of Noem and Rubio, as well as other administration officials, Young wrote that they \"acted in concert to misuse the sweeping powers of their respective offices to target noncitizen pro-Palestinians for deportation primarily on account of their First Amendment protected political speech,\" and did so through targeted deportation proceedings aimed at pro-Palestinian student activists across the country, which \"continues unconstitutionally to chill freedom of speech to this day.\"",
      "In response to Young's decision, Tommy Pigott, a spokesperson for the State Department, said, \"The United States is under no obligation to allow foreign aliens to come to our country, commit acts of anti-American, pro-terrorist, and antisemitic hate, or incite violence. We will continue to revoke the visas of those who put the safety of our citizens at risk.\"",
      "The judge issued his decision after holding a nine-day trial that examined whether the administration had violated the free speech rights of academic associations that sued the Trump administration for arrests, detentions and deportations of foreign students and faculty who participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations.",
      "Young praised the witnesses who testified on behalf of the government, saying of them that they were \"decent, credible, dedicated nonpartisan professionals. True patriots who, in order to do their duty, have been weaponized by their highest superiors to reach foregone conclusions for most ignoble ends.\"",
      "But he accused Rubio and Noem of acting with \"invidious\" intent: \"to target a few for speaking out and then use the full rigor of the Immigration and Nationality Act (in ways it had never been used before) to have them publicly deported with the goal of tamping down pro-Palestinian student protests and terrorizing similarly situated non-citizen (and other) pro-Palestinians into silence because their views were unwelcome.\"",
      "Young further chastised the Trump administration for deploying masked agents to detain students like Tufts University doctoral student and Turkish native Rumeysa Ozturk, who was taken into custody by masked, plainclothes immigration authorities in March and spent more than a month and a half in federal immigration custody before lawyers secured her release from detention.",
      "\"This Court has listened carefully to the reasons given by \u00d6zt\u00fcrk's captors for masking-up and has heard the same reasons advanced by the defendant Todd Lyons, Acting Director of ICE. It rejects this testimony as disingenuous, squalid and dishonorable. ICE goes masked for a single reason \u2014 to terrorize Americans into quiescence,\" Young wrote. \"To us, masks are associated with cowardly desperados and the despised Ku Klux Klan. In all our history we have never tolerated an armed masked secret police.\"",
      "In response to Young's criticism of federal immigration agents wearing masks, Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, attacked the judge, calling him \"craven,\" and said officers wear masks to protect themselves.",
      "\"Our ICE law enforcement should be thanked for risking their lives every day to arrest dangerous criminals,\" she said in a statement. \"It's stunning that even after the terrorist attack and recent arrests of rioters with guns outside of ICE facilities, this Judge decides to stoke the embers of hatred.\"",
      "The judge on Tuesday also responded to a threat sent to his chambers, putting the anonymous threat, and his response, at the top of the opinion \u2014 an unusual, rare move.",
      "\"Trump has pardons and tanks \u2026 what do you have?\" says the post card, dated June 19 and written by hand. Young responds that \"Alone, I have nothing but my sense of duty. Together, We the People of the United States \u2014 you and me \u2014 have our magnificent Constitution,\" he writes, before delivering his opinion in the case. At the end of his opinion, Young again wrote to the person who sent the anonymous threat.",
      "\"I hope you found this helpful. Thanks for writing. It shows you care. You should,\" Young wrote.",
      "The judge then invited the anonymous sender to visit the court to watch a proceeding.",
      "While Young concluded that Noem and Rubio unconstitutionally chilled the free speech rights of pro-Palestinian students by targeting them for deportation, he ended his decision with a searing rebuke of Mr. Trump and the changes to the executive branch he has ushered in since returning to the White House in January.",
      "Noem has not yet responded to a request for comment, and Rubio has also not yet responded to a request for comment.",
      "Young accused the president of \"hollow bragging\" and said he \"ignores everything\" from the Constitution to civil laws to regulations, only to continue \"bullying on.\"",
      "Given that Mr. Trump is immune from prosecution, the judge said the president is prepared to deploy \"all the resources of the nation against obstruction.\"",
      "\"Behold President Trump's successes in limiting free speech \u2014 law firms cower, institutional leaders in higher education meekly appease the President, media outlets from huge conglomerates to small niche magazines mind the bottom line rather than the ethics of journalism,\" Young wrote.",
      "In July, Paramount, the parent company of CBS News, settled a lawsuit brought by Mr. Trump over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Kamala Harris for $16 million.",
      "The judge said Mr. Trump \"meets dissent from his orders in those other two branches by demonizing and disparaging the speakers, sometimes descending to personal vitriol,\" calling those he dislikes \"traitors.\"",
      "But Young praises the judiciary for rebuffing the Trump administration in its efforts to infringe on the First Amendment rights of those he dislikes, from law firms who challenged executive orders targeting them, to universities like Harvard that have been punished by the administration to news outlets like the Associated Press.",
      "\"I fear President Trump believes the American people are so divided that today they will not stand up, fight for, and defend our most precious constitutional values so long as they are lulled into thinking their own personal interests are not affected,\" Young writes in closing. \"Is he correct?\"",
      "Young was appointed by Reagan to the federal bench in 1985 and called the case involving the administration's efforts to punish pro-Palestinian activists \"perhaps the most important\" to fall within the jurisdiction of the district court in Massachusetts.",

      "Officials said the servers were so powerful they could have disabled cell phone towers and launched distributed denial of services attacks with the ability to block emergency communications like EMS and police dispatch. An official briefed on the investigation told reporters that the sophisticated network \"could text message the entire country within 12 minutes\" and added that \"this was well organized and well funded.\"",

    "summary": "The government will shut down at 12 a.m. on Wednesday if lawmakers do not reach an agreement to extend government funding.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The federal government will begin shutting down at 12 a.m. on Wednesday if lawmakers do not reach an agreement to extend government funding, an outcome that appears more and more likely as the deadline approaches.",
      "Republicans and Democrats have been at odds over how to fund the government as Democrats have pushed for negotiations over health care tax credits to be included in a funding measure. Without an extension or approval of another funding bill, spending authority is set to expire, sending the federal government into a shutdown.",
      "Each agency and department would begin shutdown procedures on Wednesday morning, leading to hundreds of thousands of workers being placed on furlough. Essential employees will stay on the job, but nearly all employees, whether furloughed or not, will go without pay for the duration of the funding lapse.",
      "The likely shutdown is the result of weeks of disagreements between Republicans and Democrats in Washington over funding the government. Here's the back story:",
      "How Congress funds the government",
      "Each year, Congress faces a deadline to approve government funding by the start of a new fiscal year on Oct. 1. The Constitution outlines that Congress must approve any money spent by the federal government. Bills to approve that spending must originate in the House, pass the Senate and be signed by the president before departments and agencies can use the funds.",
      "The government funding process often stretches late into the fiscal year, and in recent decades Congress has nearly always resorted to stopgap measures to keep the government funded in order to give lawmakers more time to approve new spending.",
      "The funding fights often go down to the wire, as the minority looks to use its leverage to extract concessions. But lawmakers also have strong incentives to avoid shutdowns, since they can be economically and politically costly. The last funding lapse stretched from December 2018 until January 2019 and caused a permanent loss of about $3 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The 2025 funding fight",
      "This time around, Democrats have refused to help Republicans in the majority extend government funding without addressing health insurance subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year. Republicans have been steadfast in their belief that health care and other issues should be negotiated outside the context of funding the government, and urged Democrats to agree to a temporary funding extension.",
      "On Sept. 19, House Republicans passed what's known as a continuing resolution to keep the government funded at existing levels until Nov. 21. Republicans touted the \"clean\" continuing resolution that would give lawmakers more time to work out full-year spending bills. But Democrats insisted that Republicans negotiate with them on the funding plan to earn their support.",
      "Although Republicans have majorities in the House and Senate, most legislation in the upper chamber is subject to a 60-vote threshold to advance. With 53 Republicans, Democratic support is necessary.",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats pushed their own proposal to avert a shutdown with a bill that would keep the government funded until Oct. 31. Their bill also includes a number of their priorities, including a permanent extension of enhanced tax credits for Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, which became a red line for their support.",
      "Both the House-passed bill and the Democratic proposal fell short in the Senate, as the two parties became locked in a stalemate over the funding plan. And a decision by House GOP leaders to keep the House away from Washington until after the funding deadline has all but ruled out alternate paths forward.",
      "A meeting between President Trump and the congressional leaders on Monday failed to yield an agreement, with the two sides trading blame for what appears to be an inevitable shutdown.",
      "What happens during a shutdown",
      "Should the government shut down, lawmakers will have to agree to a spending bill to eventually reopen the government.",
      "In the meantime, federal agencies will be forced to halt non-essential functions. The Congressional Budget Office estimated on Tuesday that about 750,000 federal employees could be furloughed, though they would receive back pay at the end of a shutdown. The total daily cost of their compensation would be around $400 million. The budget office noted that the effects of a shutdown \"depend on its duration and on an Administration's decisions about how to proceed.\"",
      "Among those employees who are deemed essential are active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency decides which employees are essential. Tens of thousands of others can stay on the job because their pay is funded through other means, like other legislation or fees.",
      "Adding to the dynamic, the White House's Office of Management and Budget\u00a0sent a memo to federal agencies last week telling them to consider reduction-in-force notices, or layoffs, for federal employees in discretionary programs. Mr. Trump said Tuesday that during a shutdown, \"we can cut large numbers of people out,\" though he added, \"we don't want to do that, but we don't want fraud, waste and abuse.\"",
      "Back in Congress, Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Tuesday that he expects the upper chamber to take additional votes to open up the government this week, though he noted that senators will observe the Jewish holiday, Yom Kippur, which begins at sundown on Wednesday and ends Thursday evening. The Senate could approve the House-passed continuing resolution and send it to the president's desk to bring a shutdown to an end.",
      "How long a shutdown could last remains to be seen. During the last shutdown, the longest in history, lawmakers approved a stopgap measure to reopen the government after 34 days.",

      "A possible U.S. government shutdown\u00a0on Wednesday could hinge on a deal to maintain a tax credit that helps 22 million Americans lower their health insurance costs when they buy policies through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces.",
      "Known as the enhanced premium tax credit, the subsidy has been used by millions of low- and middle-class households since it was authorized under the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021. Since then, spurred by the tax credit, the number of people who have enrolled in ACA marketplace health insurance plans has almost doubled, according to health care publication KFF.",
      "But it is set to expire at the end of 2025, and leading Democratic lawmakers are making a funding deal to keep the government open contingent on Republicans agreeing to extend the credit.",
      "Even as the outcome of the funding negotiations in Washington, D.C., remains uncertain, expiration of the premium health care credits could inflict financial pain on millions of Americans, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"Insurers are already preparing to send notices to households that they will see increases starting in January 2026,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy at Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal economic advocacy group, and former a White House economic official under former President Joe Biden, on a conference call Friday to discuss the tax credit.",
      "He added, \"People are more and more concerned about the cost of living, and [this is] a hit to their pocketbooks that they will start seeing in weeks.\"",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the enhanced ACA premium tax credits set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "How much could ACA premiums increase?",
      "The cost of premiums for people who buy their insurance through the ACA marketplaces could more than double, rising from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to a Sept. 30 analysis by KFF.\u00a0About 4 million people would likely drop their insurance coverage if the credit is allowed to expire because they would't be able to afford the costs, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The premium tax credit is aimed at people who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans, and who can't get affordable health care through an employer. The credit is available for those who earn between 100% to 400% of the poverty level, which means a family of four with annual income of up to $128,600 would qualify for the credit.",
      "With expiration of the ACA coverage credit only months away, some policy holders have already received noticed that their premiums \u2014 the monthly fee paid for insurance coverage \u2014 are poised to surge next year. Insurers have sent out notices in nearly every state, with some proposing premium increases of as much as 50%.",
      "Insurers are already planning on substantial premium hikes in 2026, according to a Peterson KFF Health System Tracker survey published last month. The poll found that 312 insurers participating in ACA marketplaces are proposing median increases of 18% next year, about 11 percentage points higher than in 2025.",
      "That increase would represent the largest rate hike since 2018, and is driven by higher costs for medical care as well as the expiration of the premium tax credits. Sharply higher ACA premiums would likely cause healthier people to drop coverage, making it more expensive to insure those who remain, the group said.",
      "The proposed hikes range from a high of 39.9%, from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma, to a low of 4.6% for Oscar Garden State Insurance Corporation, their survey found.",

    "summary": "Pfizer's CEO said President Trump's threat of tariffs motivated his company to take swift action.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Pfizer has agreed to offer significantly discounted prices for some prescription drugs for all American consumers and has committed to offer prescription medications to Medicaid at lower prices, President Trump announced Tuesday. The president said the drugs will be available for purchase online on a website operated by the federal government, which the White House has said will be called \"TrumpRx.\"",
      "\"Today, I'm thrilled to announce that one of the world's largest pharmaceutical manufacturers and one of the best anywhere in the world, Pfizer, has agreed to offer countless prescription medications at major discounts in the United States, a result of the 'most favored nation' drug pricing order that we established earlier this year,\" Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office.",
      "Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, who was in the Oval Office with the president for the announcement, said Mr. Trump's threat of 100% tariffs on drugs manufactured outside the U.S. motivated his company to take swift action. The president said Pfizer's drug prices will be lower starting \"immediately.\"",
      "The president said the cost of some Pfizer drugs could see decreases in price of 50%-100%. Mr. Trump said this would save American consumers and taxpayers \"hundreds of millions of dollars a year.\" The president said Americans have been \"subsidizing research and development costs for the entire planet\" because of the higher prices they have been paying.",
      "\"We're also announcing that moving forward, all new medications introduced by Pfizer to the American market will be sold at the reduced most favored nation cost,\" the president added. \"So, we'll be paying essentially what other countries are paying, who have been much lower \u2014 much, much lower for many, many years.\"",
      "Bourla called it an \"historic day\" because Pfizer would be reversing an \"unfair situation.\"",
      "\"For years, other rich nations refused to pay their fair share for medical innovation,\" Bourla said. \"And as a result, Americans had to assume disproportionate costs.\"",
      "The Pfizer agreement is a part of the White House agenda to secure \"most favored nation\" pricing with pharmaceutical manufacturers. In May, Mr. Trump signed an executive order\u00a0calling on drugmakers to lower their prices and bring them in line with what other high-income countries pay for the same drugs. He threatened to subject them to steep caps on how much they can earn from Medicare if they failed to do so.",
      "Monday was the deadline for drugmakers to reach agreements to bring down drug costs, the Post reported, after the president's May executive order. While the U.S. has less than 5% of the world's population and uses about 13% of the world's prescription drugs, the U.S. funds over 70% of global pharmaceutical profits, according to the White House.",
      "The president's announcement comes days after he announced that on Wednesday, the U.S. would begin imposing a 100% tariff on any branded or patented pharmaceutical product \"unless a Company IS BUILDING their Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plant in America.\" That move could increase the costs of some drugs for consumers.",
      "Bourla mentioned the impending tariffs in his comments Tuesday, saying the tariffs had motivated his company. He said the Mr. Trump gave Pfizer a three-year grace period on the tariffs, and the tariffs would be inapplicable, as long as Pfizer manufactures in the U.S. As a part of the agreement, Bourla said Pfizer agreed to move their production of medicines used in America to the U.S.",
      "\"The president is absolutely right, tariff is the most powerful tool to motivate behaviors, Mr. President,\" Bourla said. \"And clearly motivated ours, right?\"",
      "Mr. Trump also said the tariffs had \"played a big role\" in the deal.",
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said more details of agreements by pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices will come this fall. Mr. Trump echoed that point, saying other companies are on board, too.",
      "\"President Trump is doing more to lower healthcare costs than anyone else in Washington, D.C.,\" said White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai ahead of the president's announcement. \"While Democrats are threatening to shut down the government to subsidize health care for illegal aliens, President Trump is leveraging the power of the federal government to drastically cut drug prices for everyday Americans. Democrats talked the talk for decades about drug prices, but only President Trump is actually walking the walk.\"",
      "Neither Pfizer nor the White House have released specific drug prices yet.",
      "The details of the \"TrumpRx\" website have not yet been shared, but a senior administration official expected the website to be live in early 2026.",
      "The announcement comes as Democrats remain at an impasse with the president and Republicans over keeping the government funded beyond midnight: they say the president is not doing enough to lower health care prices, and they've been pushing for an extension of the Affordable Care Act before premiums increase for many who have health care through the ACA.",

      "Federal immigration officials have revealed plans to reopen the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program to new applicants to comply with a court order, though they cautioned the Trump administration retains the discretion to modify the Obama-era policy.",
      "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has made plans to accept and process new DACA applications from immigrants not enrolled in the initiative, which currently allows more than half a million so-called \"Dreamers\" to live and work in the U.S. without fear of deportation, the Justice Department said in a court filing Monday.",
      "Dreamers are immigrants who, as children, entered the U.S. illegally or overstayed their visas. The Obama administration created DACA in 2012 to protect this population from deportation amid congressional gridlock on immigration reform. Due to litigation, DACA has been closed to new applicants since 2021, though existing beneficiaries have been able to renew their two-year work permits.",
      "To qualify for DACA, applicants must show they arrived in the U.S. by age 16 and before June 2007; that they enrolled in an American high school or enlisted in the military; and lack any serious criminal record.",
      "The announcement that DACA could be reopened pending a ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Andrew Hanen was outlined in a Justice Department court filing in the years-long legal battle over the policy.",
      "The government's plan is designed to comply with an order from the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in January that upheld Hanen's finding that the DACA program is unlawful.",
      "While the 5th Circuit found that a Biden administration regulation to codify DACA violated U.S. immigration law, the appeals court narrowed the ruling's impact, making it applicable only in Texas, the state spearheading the Republican-led lawsuit against the program. The appellate court also paused its ruling as it relates to existing DACA beneficiaries.",
      "To comply with that order, the Trump administration said it intends to process initial DACA requests once Hanen issues an order dictating the next steps in the case.",
      "The administration said applicants in all states outside of Texas who are approved will be eligible for DACA's deportation protections and work permits. Those residing in Texas will only be eligible for the program's deportation deferrals \u2014 not work authorization. Texas residents approved for DACA will also not be considered to be lawfully present in the U.S., unlike existing recipients. Those who move to Texas could have their work permits revoked.",
      "Texas has been able to convince federal courts that it has been harmed by the federal government's efforts to grant work permits and other benefits to unauthorized immigrants through DACA.",
      "As of the end of June, there were more than 525,000 people enrolled in DACA, with nearly 88,000 of them living in Texas, home to the second-largest Dreamer population in the country, according to federal data.",
      "The Trump administration reiterated in its court filing Monday that these plans do not prevent the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees USCIS, \"from undertaking any future lawful changes to DACA.\"",
      "While President Trump tried to terminate DACA during his first term \u2014 a move the Supreme Court blocked in 2020 on technical grounds \u2014 he has not articulated a firm plan for the program's future during his second administration.",
      "As the second Trump administration has dramatically expanded efforts across the country to arrest and deport people living in the U.S. unlawfully, some DACA recipients have been caught in the dragnet, including after traffic stops. While a grant of DACA offers a temporary reprieve from deportation, officials have wide-ranging discretion to revoke it.",
      "In their own filing Monday, the Republican-led states challenging DACA's legality asked Hanen to order the Trump administration to start a wind-down of the program, including for existing recipients. They argued Congress should decide the fate of DACA recipients.",
      "\"Sympathy for DACA recipients, understandable though it may be, is no substitute for statutory text or constitutional command,\" the GOP-led states wrote in their filing. \"Like all who reside within our borders, they must abide by the rule of law.\"",

    "summary": "The U.S. government could shut down on Wednesday if Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even if a U.S.\u00a0government shutdown begins on Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress, with lawmakers currently at loggerheads over funding the federal government past Sept. 30.",
      "If an agreement isn't reached before then, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for their operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",

      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",

      "Mr. Trump said Sunday that a shutdown is likely, rejecting Democrats' push for Congress to permanently extend enhanced tax credits for Americans enrolled in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, which expire at the end of the year. The president met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at the White House on Monday, but the meeting ended without a breakthrough.",
      "The president canceled an earlier meeting with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders set for last week, calling their demands \"unserious and ridiculous,\" and House Republicans left Washington, D.C., earlier this month after approving a stopgap measure that kept the government funded until Nov. 21. But the proposal failed to garner the necessary support in the Senate. A Democrat-backed counter-plan to extend funding through Oct. 31, which included other party priorities, also failed in the upper chamber.",
      "In an effort to ramp up the pressure on Democrats to go along with Republicans' funding measure, the White House budget office sent a memo to federal agencies last week telling them to consider reduction-in-force plans for mass layoffs of certain federal workers during a shutdown.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",
      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, yearlong spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are expected to feel the impacts of a shutdown if a deal isn't reached this time around.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Much of the federal government is on the verge of shutting down if Congress does not reach a deal to approve new funding by Wednesday, Oct. 1, 2025.",
      "Republicans have proposed extending government funding at current levels until Nov. 21 to allow for members to continue working on full-year appropriations bills. Democrats made a counteroffer to keep the government open through October, but attached health care provisions and restrictions on President Trump's ability to withhold funding, both of which are nonstarters with most Republicans.",
      "The two sides are dug in on their positions, increasing the chances of a shutdown beginning Wednesday. Congressional leaders met with President Trump at the White House on Monday to search for a path forward, but walked away in the same position.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding for some or all agencies, which can't spend money that hasn't been approved by lawmakers. There have been 14 shutdowns since 1980, with the most recent coming in 2018. That shutdown lasted 34 days.",
      "Here's what to know about what happens during a government shutdown:",
      "What is a government shutdown?",
      "Most federal government agencies are funded annually by a dozen appropriations bills that need to be passed by Congress and signed by the president before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. These are often grouped together into one large piece of legislation known as an \"omnibus\" bill to speed up the process when Congress inevitably needs to pass a number of them at the last minute.",
      "If the funding deadline passes without Congress authorizing more spending, the government must fully or partially shut down, depending on which agencies are already funded. Ahead of this year's deadline, none of the 12 appropriations bills have been enacted. Some agencies got an infusion of money in the Republican-passed \"one big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year, meaning certain programs and functions in some departments will remain funded in the event of a shutdown, chiefly the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Lawmakers regularly buy themselves more time to finish spending bills by passing what's known as a continuing resolution, which temporarily extends current funding levels to keep agencies functioning while they work to reach an agreement on new spending.",
      "The Constitution says the Treasury Department cannot spend money without a law authorizing it. Under a statute known as the Antideficiency Act, agencies are required to cease operations \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 in the absence of funding authorized by Congress. The act, a version of which first passed in 1870, with several significant updates since, also prohibits the government from entering into financial obligations without congressional sign-off.",
      "\"Treasury cannot pay out any money if there's not a law providing for who gets the money,\" said Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"If those annual bills expire, then there is no law appropriating money for certain functions.\"",
      "What happens during a government shutdown, and who is affected?",
      "In a shutdown, the federal government must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded by other means, like fees or other legislation. Each agency determines what work is essential and what is not. Members of Congress make that determination for their own staff, as well.",
      "\"No money can come out of Treasury whether you're essential or not essential. But who can keep working and incur obligations, even when there are no appropriations \u2014 there are three exceptions,\" Glassman said.",
      "Those exceptions are defined by the Antideficiency Act. They allow the government to fund operations to protect life and property, and keep officials involved in the constitutional process on the job, like the president, his staff and members of Congress.",
      "All active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals are considered essential, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency determines which of its employees can stay on the job.",
      "In a step that differs from previous shutdowns, the Office of Budget and Management last week told federal agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs for programs or projects that have discretionary funding that runs out on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices issued during a shutdown, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Whether employees are essential or not, if their pay is dependent on annual appropriations, they won't get paid during a shutdown.",
      "Essential employees continue to work during the shutdown, but don't get paid until funding is restored to their agency. Employees in nonessential positions are typically furloughed until the government is funded again, although that could look different this time if there are widespread layoffs. Under a 2019 law, furloughed employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "A Senate report published in 2019 found that government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion, including at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed workers who were not permitted to work.",
      "What is open and closed during a shutdown?",
      "Entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to function during a shutdown because benefit payments are funded through permanent appropriations that don't require renewal. Entitlement payments keep going out, but the working budgets of the agencies that oversee the programs require approval by Congress. That means staff could be furloughed, causing delays in enrolling new beneficiaries or other service interruptions.",
      "\"Any type of interaction you're having at a customer service level with the federal government could definitely be affected,\" Glassman said.",
      "For example, travel plans could be disrupted if air traffic control and airport security, who are essential workers, do not show up to work in protest for not being paid immediately. Many national parks stayed open during the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, but understaffing led to vandalism and cuts in visitor services. The parks largely closed during the 2013 shutdown. The U.S. Postal Service continues to operate, since it is self-funded.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the public may not notice the effects if the shutdown is short-lived.",
      "\"The truth is, most people won't really feel much of a difference,\" MacGuineas said. \"If you've got a vacation planned to a National Park, you're going to be [upset] and disappointed. But most people will go on with their everyday lives and interact with the government the same way they do and not feel a big difference. That could get worse, the longer it lasts.\"",
      "The Senate report found the 2018-2019 shutdown had widespread impacts across a variety of government functions that ceased or were curtailed during the lapse in funding. It noted that furloughs in many agencies like the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission hampered enforcement and investigations. The report said the Justice Department canceled 60,000 immigration hearings.",
      "The effects could be even more pronounced this time around, given the possibility that the administration could use the shutdown to implement mass layoffs, furthering the president's aim of permanently reducing the federal workforce.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "The last government shutdown stretched from December 2018 until January 2019, when congressional funding for nine executive branch departments with roughly 800,000 employees lapsed.",
      "The five-week partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO said most of that would be recovered once the shutdown ended, but estimated a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "Businesses across the country that relied on government customers reported a slowdown in business and some said they had to lay off employees. Tens of thousands of immigration court hearings were canceled. Government contractors struggled to feed their families and pay their bills.",
      "The shutdown stemmed from a standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump had vowed to close the government if the funding wasn't included in spending legislation, but Democrats refused to give in.",
      "Mr. Trump conceded after insisting for weeks that he would not reopen the government without money for the wall, signing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated a spending deal.",
      "Three weeks later, Mr. Trump signed a compromise spending bill to avert another government shutdown, ultimately accepting a bill that did not meet his $5.7 billion demand for his long-promised border wall.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "Before the early 1980s, the government would typically continue operating as usual even when funding bills hadn't been passed, but that changed after the attorney general issued opinions stating that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional approval.",
      "Since 1980, there have been 14 shutdowns, most of which lasted just a few days.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history was the 2018-2019 lapse, which lasted 34 full days. Before that, the record was 21 days in 1995 and 1996, when President Bill Clinton held out against steep spending and tax cuts favored by Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could soon go without pay or face potential layoffs if Congress remains at an impasse over government funding, with a shutdown set to begin Oct. 1.",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill has stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes are needed to advance it. Democrats want an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans have opposed. Without a resolution, the government will begin to shut down on Wednesday.",
      "If funding lapses, federal employees in critical positions would be required to stay on the job. Many others would be forced to stay home. Both groups would have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown threat means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid if there's a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck even if they haven't reached a deal to fund the government.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" This means they must get paid whether or not other parts of the government are funded.",
      "Pursuant to that section, members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election. Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change.",

Only 15% of the costs had been reimbursed by Jan. 6 defendants as of summer 2024, according to a review by CBS News. But hours after returning to office, President Trump pardoned everybody convicted as part of the riot.",
      "In a letter dated Monday and obtained by CBS News, the top Democrats on the Senate Rules and Senate Judiciary committees asked the Justice Department to oppose efforts to seek repayments by those convicted in the Jan. 6, 2021, riots.",
      "\"These criminals are apparently demanding taxpayer compensation, not only to refund court-ordered restitution to cover damages they caused to the Capitol Building, but also to compensate them for having to face legal consequences for their actions,\" the letter reads.",
      "A CBS News review of court filings by some of the more than 1,500 pardoned Capitol riot defendants shows a growing number of formal requests to have federal courts order reimbursements.",
      "In a request submitted to a D.C. federal judge on Monday, riot defendant Richard Barnett cited Mr. Trump's pardon and Barnett's appeal of his conviction as part of a justification for the reimbursement of $2,455 in restitution and court assessment payments. Barnett's argument, in part, cited prior cases of pardon defendants.",
      "It said the Justice Department's decision in February to vacate his case \"wipes the slate clean, and restores to the defendant both the presumption of innocence and the right to be paid money based on a now vacated conviction.\"",
      "Barnett was found guilty by a Washington, D.C., grand jury in 2023, after prosecutors successfully argued he was on the front lines of the mob and was photographed with his feet on a desk in the office of then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat.",
      "Last month, U.S. District Judge John Bates ordered the reimbursement of restitution payments to Jan. 6 defendant Yvonne St. Cyr, who was found guilty of obstructing law enforcement and other offenses as part of the Capitol riot.",
      "Bates directed the U.S. Treasury to pay the defendant back $2,270. The judge noted that St. Cyr was in the process of appealing her case when Mr. Trump returned to office, and an appellate court moved to vacate her conviction because she received a pardon from the president, so in \"the eyes of the law, no conviction ever existed.\"",
      "Bates' 15-page order opened, \"Sometimes a judge is called upon to do what the law requires, even if it may seem at odds with what justice or one's initial instincts might warrant. This is one such occasion.\"",
      "According to court filings reviewed by CBS News, the Justice Department supported St. Cyr's request for repayment. A filing submitted by U.S. Attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro in August said the conviction \"was 'invalidated' when the D.C. Circuit vacated it.\"",

      "A warrant for the arrest of a California doctor is a rare charge of violating one of the state abortion bans that has taken effect since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and allowed enforcement.",
      "It represents an additional front in a growing legal battle between liberal and conservative states over prescribing abortion medications via telehealth and mailing them to patients.",
      "Pills are the most common way abortions are accessed in the U.S. and are a major reason that, despite the bans, abortion numbers rose last year, according to a report.",
      "Louisiana said in a court case filed Sept. 19 that it had issued a warrant for a California-based doctor who it says provided pills to a Louisiana woman in 2023.",
      "Both the woman, Rosalie Markezich, and the state's attorney general are seeking to be part of a lawsuit that seeks to order drug regulators to bar telehealth prescriptions to mifepristone, one of the two drugs usually used in combination for medication abortions.",
      "In court filings, Markezich says her boyfriend at the time used her email address to order drugs from Dr. Remy Coeytaux, a California physician, and sent her $150, which she forwarded to Coeytaux. She said she had no other contact with the doctor.",
      "She said she did not want to take the pills but felt forced to and said in the filing that \"the trauma of my chemical abortion still haunts me\" and that it would not have happened if telehealth prescriptions to the drug were off limits.",
      "The accusation builds on a position taken by anti-abortion groups: that allowing abortion pills to be prescribed by phone or video call and filled by mail opens the door to women being coerced into taking them.",
      "\"Rosalie is bravely representing many woman who are victimized by the illegal, immoral, and unethical conduct of these drug dealers,\" Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said in a statement.",
      "Murrill's office didn't immediately answer questions about what charges Coeytaux faces or when the warrant was issued. But under the state's ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy, physicians convicted of providing abortions face up to 15 years in prison and $200,000 in fines.",
      "Coeytaux is also the target of a lawsuit filed in July in federal court by a Texas man who says the doctor illegally provided his girlfriend with abortion pills.",

New York authorities are refusing to extradite Carpenter to Louisiana or to enforce Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton the $100,000 civil judgment against her.",
      "In the Louisiana case, officials said a pregnant minor's mother requested the abortion medication online and directed her daughter to take them. The mother was arrested, pleaded not guilty and was released on bond.",

      "The move by Bondi \u2014 which she hinted at on Friday \u2014 came after one detainee was killed and two others were injured in a shooting at an ICE field office in Dallas on Wednesday, the latest shooting or threat targeting an ICE facility or immigration agent in recent months. She cast that attack as the latest act of \"extreme political violence.\"",
      "In a memo shared on X, Bondi said the FBI, DEA, U.S. Marshals Service and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives should \"immediately direct all necessary officers and agents to defend ICE facilities and personnel whenever and wherever they come under attack.\" She also announced the formation of a temporary \"ICE Protection Task Force\" that could include federal, state and local law enforcement agencies.",

    "published": "Tue, 30 Sep 2025 00:10:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump floated a framework to end the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accepted \u2014 though it's unclear how Hamas will respond.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump offered up a 20-point plan Monday that he cast as a roadmap to end the Israel-Hamas war, a proposal that was backed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2014 though it remains unclear how Hamas will respond.",
      "The plan \u2014 which was presented as Netanyahu visited the White House \u2014 calls for Hamas to return all Israeli hostages within 72 hours, and for Israel's military to begin withdrawing from parts of the Gaza Strip in phases. It proposes handing over parts of Gaza to a \"technocratic\" committee and deploying a temporary security force backed by Arab states.",
      "Mr. Trump said in a joint press conference with Netanyahu that his goal is to ensure a \"sustainable, long-term peace.\"",
      "Israel and Hamas have been at war since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led terrorists attacked southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. Since then, Israel has waged an intense aerial bombardment and ground campaign in the Gaza Strip. More than 60,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not specify how many of the dead were civilians or militants.",
      "Netanyahu said Monday he supports the plan, which \"achieves our war aims.\" He said if Hamas does not accept the offer, \"Israel will finish the job by itself.\"",
      "Hamas has not yet responded to the proposal. Qatar's prime minister and Egypt's intelligence chief met with negotiators from Hamas, who said they would review the proposal \"in good faith\" and provide a response, a White House official told CBS News.",
      "Some unanswered questions about the plan still linger, including the exact timing of possible Israeli withdrawals from Gaza and the involvement of different international partners.",
      "Israel and Hamas would stop fighting, trade hostages and prisoners",
      "The plan calls for an immediate end to fighting if both Israel and Hamas agree to the plan, with Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip immediately withdrawing to an \"agreed upon line.\"",
      "\"During this time, all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended, and battle lines will remain frozen until conditions are met for the complete staged withdrawal,\" the plan states.",
      "Within 72 hours of Israel accepting the deal, which Netanyahu appeared to do Monday, Hamas is expected to free all remaining hostages. Some 50 hostages are still in Gaza, fewer than half of whom are believed to be alive, according to Israeli authorities.",
      "In exchange, Israel is expected to release 250 Palestinians serving life sentences, as well as 1,700 other Gazans who were detained following the start of the current conflict. The plan calls for the remains of 15 deceased Gazans to be returned for every one deceased hostage. The Israeli releases would take place after the hostages are released by Hamas.",
      "The plan calls for Gaza to be demilitarized \"under the supervision of independent monitors,\" with any weapons factories and tunnels destroyed and weapons decommissioned.",
      "\"A guarantee will be provided by regional partners to ensure that Hamas, and the factions, comply with their obligations and that New Gaza poses no threat to its neighbors or its people,\" one of the 20 points states.",
      "Aid and economic development would enter Gaza",
      "The plan states \"full aid will be immediately sent\" to Gaza, which has faced severe food shortages and has fallen into famine in some regions, according to the world's leading authority on food crises.",
      "It calls for aid deliveries that are at least equal to the levels agreed upon during a prior two-month ceasefire that began in January, with supplies flowing through the Rafah border crossing in southern Gaza. It also states the plan would involve \"rehabilitation of hospitals and bakeries.\"",
      "It states aid would be distributed by \"international institutions not associated in any manner with either party,\" including the United Nations and the Red Crescent. The plan does not mention the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a controversial U.S.- and Israeli-backed group that has handled many aid deliveries in the territory in recent months, whose members have been repeatedly accused of firing at Palestinians trying to get aid.",
      "The proposal also floats convening a \"panel of experts\" that could draw up economic redevelopment plans for the Gaza Strip. It states Gaza would exist in a \"special economic zone\" with \"preferred tariff and access rates.\"",
      "Gaza to be led by \"technocratic\" group and stabilization force, not Hamas",
      "After Israel withdraws from parts of Gaza, the plan calls for the territory to be governed by neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority, which currently oversees much of the West Bank.",
      "Instead, the enclave would be governed by a \"technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee, responsible for delivering the day-to-day running of public services and municipalities for the people in Gaza.\" It's not clear who would participate in that committee, but the plan states it would be composed of \"qualified Palestinians and international experts.\"",
      "Overseeing this new governing structure would be a \"Board of Peace\" chaired by Mr. Trump.",
      "In a press conference Monday, the president said he's slated to lead the board \"not at my request, believe me. I'm very busy. But we have to make sure this works.\"",
      "The plan also envisions an \"International Stabilization Force\" that would temporarily oversee security in Gaza. This group would be backed by the U.S. and Arab states, and tasked with training \"vetted Palestinian Police forces\" in collaboration with Jordan and Egypt.",
      "It states Hamas would need to \"agree to not have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly, indirectly, or in any form.\" But Hamas members would get amnesty if they \"commit to peaceful co-existence and to decommission their weapons,\" and members of the group who want to leave the territory would be able to do so.",
      "The plan would also \u2014 at least temporarily \u2014 sideline the Palestinian Authority, which has played a key part in security and governance in the occupied Palestinian territories since the 1990s. The authority is dominated by Fatah, a political movement that has long been at odds with Hamas, and it has not governed Gaza since Hamas took over the strip in 2007.",
      "Netanyahu has long criticized the Palestinian Authority. He said Monday the group would have \"no role whatsoever in Gaza without undergoing a radical and genuine transformation,\" including changes to its education system and an end to a long-controversial stipend system for the families of Palestinian militants.",
      "The West Bank \u2014 which Israel has occupied since 1967 \u2014 is home to millions of Palestinians and hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers. Since the 1990s, the territory has been split up between areas where the Palestinian Authority has some degree of control and areas fully governed by the Israeli military. The Gaza Strip was also occupied in 1967, though Israel withdrew from the territory and removed its settlements in 2005. The territory has been under a tight Israeli and Egyptian blockade since Hamas' 2007 takeover.",
      "Israel would withdraw from Gaza and won't annex territory",
      "The Israel Defense Forces would immediately withdraw from part of Gaza after a deal is reached. It would continue to withdraw from parts of the territory and hand over control to the new International Stabilization Force \"based on standards, milestones, and timeframes linked to demilitarization.\"",
      "Israeli forces would remain present in a \"security perimeter,\" however, until Gaza \"is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat,\" the plan states. Netanyahu said Monday the IDF would remain in that perimeter \"for the foreseeable future.\"",
      "If Hamas doesn't accept the proposal, it calls for the plan to \"proceed in the terror-free areas\" that are handed over from the Israeli military to the new stabilization force.",
      "Plan calls statehood an \"aspiration of the Palestinian people\"",
      "The proposal does not lay out a clear roadmap for an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. But it says that, if the plan works out, \"the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognize as the aspiration of the Palestinian people.\"",
      "Netanyahu has ruled out allowing a Palestinian state to be formed, and has castigated U.S. allies like the United Kingdom and France for recognizing a Palestinian state last week at the United Nations General Assembly, calling it an \"absurd prize for terrorism.\" Mr. Trump has also opposed calls for a Palestinian state. But key Arab partners have backed Palestinian statehood and cast it as a necessary component of any long-term resolution.",
      "The plan also pushes for an \"interfaith dialogue process\" to \"try and change mindsets and narratives of Palestinians and Israelis,\" and a \"dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous co-existence.\"",

      "Lawmakers were away on recess last week after the House approved a GOP-led continuing resolution to keep the government funded until Nov. 21. But the measure fell short in the Senate, as Democrats pushed a counter-proposal that would keep the government funded through October, while attaching a handful of their priorities.

But the posture has proven complicated for the party that has repeatedly supported efforts to keep the government funded.",
      "Democrats push for negotiations",
      "Both parties have pushed for a stopgap measure to keep the government funded while work on full-year appropriations bills continues, but Democrats have advocated for weeks for taking the funding effort to the negotiating table, introducing a counter-proposal earlier this month that appeared to serve as an opening salvo.",
      "While the Republican-led continuing resolution would fund the government until Nov. 21, the Democrats' proposal includes one of their key priorities \u2014 extending expiring health insurance subsidies.",
      "The proposal, which would extend government funding until Oct. 31 and boost security funding, includes a permanent extension of enhanced tax credits for Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, which Democrats have suggested is a red line for their support. The subsidies, which were originally passed in 2021, are set to expire at the end of the year.",
      "Also in their proposed measure to fund the government, Democrats included language to roll back Medicaid restrictions in President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" and restore funding for public broadcasters that was rescinded earlier this year.",

A month later, X agreed to pay Mr. Trump $10 million to settle its lawsuit, which was filed before billionaire Trump ally Elon Musk bought the platform.",
      "The lawsuit against YouTube argued that the suspension violated Mr. Trump's First Amendment rights because it was allegedly done \"in response to coercion of the federal government.\" Attorneys for the tech firm had called that argument \"meritless\" in a 2021 court filing, and said forcing the platform to host Mr. Trump without any restrictions \"would conflict with YouTube's own First Amendment rights.\"",
      "In settling the lawsuit, YouTube and its parent company, Google parent Alphabet, agreed to pay $22 million to Mr. Trump, all of which will be directed into the Trust for the National Mall, a fund that is \"dedicated to restoring, preserving, and elevating that National Mall\" and \"to support the construction of the White House State Ballroom\" that Mr. Trump is building.",

      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies would be expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even if lawmakers fail this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",

      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",

It also goes further and says that employees should get RIF notices if they're in programs or projects \"not consistent with the President's priorities.\"",

      "A digital reconstruction of a million-year-old skull suggests humans may have diverged from our ancient ancestors 400,000 years earlier than thought and in Asia, not Africa, a study found.",
      "The findings, published Thursday, are based on a reconstruction of a crushed skull discovered in China in 1990 and have the potential to resolve the long-standing \"Muddle in the Middle\" of human evolution, researchers said.",
      "But experts not involved in the work cautioned that the findings were likely to be disputed and pointed to ongoing uncertainties in the timeline of human evolution.",
      "The skull, labelled Yunxian 2, was previously thought to belong to a human forerunner called Homo erectus.",
      "But modern reconstruction technologies revealed features closer to a species previously thought to have existed only later in human evolution, including the recently discovered Homo longi and our own Homo sapiens.",
      "\"This changes a lot of thinking,\" said Chris Stringer, an anthropologist at the Natural History Museum, London, who was part of the research team.",
      "\"It suggests that by 1 million years ago, our ancestors had already split into distinct groups, pointing to a much earlier and more complex human evolutionary split than previously believed,\" he added.",

      "\"From the very beginning, when we got the result, we thought it was unbelievable. How could that be so deep into the past?\" Xijun Ni, a professor at Fudan University who co-led the analysis, told BBC News. \"But we tested it again and again to test all the models, use all the methods, and we are now confident about the result, and we're actually very excited.\"",

      "The scientists relied in part on another similar skull to shape their model, and then compared it to over 100 other specimens.",
      "The resulting model \"shows a distinctive combination of traits,\" the researchers said, some of them similar to Homo erectus, including a projecting lower face.",
      "But other aspects, including its apparently larger brain capacity, are closer to Homo longi and Homo sapiens, according to the study.",
      "\"Yunxian 2 may help us resolve what's been called the 'Muddle in the Middle,' the confusing array of human fossils from between 1 million and 300,000 years ago,\" Stringer said in a press release.",
      "Much about human evolution remains debated, and Petraglia said the study's findings were \"provocative\" though grounded in solid work.",
      "\"It's sound, but I think the jury's still out. I think there will be a lot of questions raised,\" he said.",
      "Andy Herries, an archeologist at La Trobe University, said he was not convinced by the conclusions and that genetic analysis had shown fossil morphology, or shape, was \"not always a perfect indicator for human evolution.\"",

      "Dr. Aylwyn Scally, an evolutionary geneticist at Cambridge University, told BBC News that although the study's conclusions were plausible, they were far from certain, and that more evidence was needed to be sure.",
      "\"That picture is still quite unclear to us, so if the conclusions of this research are supported by other analyses, ideally from some genetic data, then I think we would start to be increasingly confident about it,\" he told BBC News.",

      "OpenAI, the company that developed ChatGPT,\u00a0announced\u00a0new parental controls on Monday aimed at helping protect young people who interact with its generative artificial intelligence program.",
      "All ChatGPT users will have access to the control features from Monday onward, the company said.",
      "The announcement comes as OpenAI, which technically allows users as young as 13 to sign up, contends with mounting public pressure to prioritize the safety of ChatGPT for teenagers. (OpenAI says on its website that it requires users ages 13 to 18 to obtain parental consent before using ChatGPT.)",
      "In August, the California-based technology company pledged to implement changes to its flagship product after facing\u00a0a wrongful death lawsuit\u00a0by parents of a 16-year-old who alleged the chatbot led their son to take his own life.",
      "OpenAI's new controls will allow parents to link their own ChatGPT accounts to the accounts of their teenagers \"and customize settings for a safe, age-appropriate experience,\" OpenAI said in Monday's announcement. Certain types of content are then automatically restricted on a teenager's linked account, including graphic content, viral challenges, \"sexual, romantic or violent\" role-play, and \"extreme beauty ideals,\" according to the company.",
      "Along with content moderation, parents can opt to receive a notification from OpenAI should their child exhibit potential signs of harming themselves while interacting with ChatGPT.",
      "\"If our systems detect potential harm, a small team of specially trained people reviews the situation,\" the company said. \"If there are signs of acute distress, we will contact parents by email, text message and push alert on their phone, unless they have opted out.\"",
      "The company also said it is \"working on the right process and circumstances in which to reach law enforcement or other emergency services\" in emergencies where a teen may be in imminent danger and a parent cannot be reached.",
      "\"We know some teens turn to ChatGPT during hard moments, so we've built a new notification system to help parents know if something may be seriously wrong,\" OpenAI said.",
      "OpenAI has introduced other measures recently aimed at helping safeguard younger ChatGPT users. The company said earlier this month that chatbot users identified as being under 18 will automatically be directed to a version that is governed by \"age-appropriate\" content rules.",
      "\"The way ChatGPT responds to a 15-year-old should look different than the way it responds to an adult,\" the company said at the time.",
      "It noted on Monday, however, that while guardrails help, \"they're not foolproof and can be bypassed if someone is intentionally trying to get around them.\"",
      "People can use ChatGPT without creating an account, and parental controls and automatic content limits only work if users are signed in.",
      "\"We will continue to thoughtfully iterate and improve over time,\" the company said. \"We recommend parents talk with their teens about healthy AI use and what that looks like for their family.\"",

      "Users of the chatbot identified as under the age of 18 will automatically be directed to a version of ChatGPT governed by \"age-appropriate\" content rules, OpenAI said in a\u00a0statement.

      "The announcement comes just days after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched a probe into the potential negative effects of AI chatbot companions on children and teens. OpenAI said that it's prioritizing \"making ChatGPT helpful and safe for everyone, and we know safety matters above all else when young people are involved.",
      "Before the FTC probe, OpenAI indicated that it would introduce\u00a0extra safety protections\u00a0for vulnerable users and teens, after the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine of California, who died by suicide in April, sued the company late last month. Raine's family allege that ChatGPT led their teen to commit suicide.",

      "Other tech companies have taken similar steps to shield teen users from inappropriate content. YouTube, for example, announced a new age-estimation technology that will track the types of videos users watch and how long they've had their account to verify if they are under the age of 18.",
      "According\u00a0to an April Pew Research Center report, parents are generally more worried about the mental health of teenagers than are teens themselves. Among those parents who are at least somewhat concerned about teen mental health, 44% said social media had the biggest negative impact on adolescents.",

    "summary": "\"I am very happy doing what I am doing,\" says one young electrician who pursued a skilled trade as AI disrupts the job market for college grads.",
    "story": [
      "At just 23, Jacob Palmer is already running his own electrical company. He launched the business in 2024 after starting in the field as an apprentice electrician, a career path he embarked on when college turned out not to be for him.",
      "Palmer has no regrets about his decision to forego college and instead establish himself as a tradesman. \"I am very happy doing what I am doing now because it has given me the opportunity to work for myself and be independent,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Experts say the skilled trades \u2014 jobs like electricians, plumbers, welders, masons, HVAC technicians and other occupations requiring extensive training and often licensing \u2014 are attracting a growing number of young people put off by high tuition costs.",
      "More than 57% of Gen Zers surveyed by Jobber, a software tool for service businesses, cite student loan debt as a concern about going to college, according to the company's annual report on attitudes toward blue-collar jobs.",
      "More recently, signs that\u00a0artificial intelligence is starting to gobble up the kind of entry-level jobs that once went to young college graduates are also leading young workers to consider the trades. Some 77% of Gen Zers say it's important that their future job is hard to automate, with many pointing to professions like carpenter, plumber, and electrician as occupations they believe are safe from automation. By contrast, they see less security in fields like software development, data analytics, and accounting, according to the survey.",
      "\"That route is losing some of the stigma,\" said David Asay, president of Advantage Reline, a trenchless pipe rehabilitation company in Mesa, Arizona. \"The perception among that younger group is no longer, 'Oh, you're working construction, you didn't go to school?' It's, 'What a cool skillset. You're making a good career path.'\"",
      "Harder path for college grads",
      "For decades, many young people shunned the trades, with everyone from economists and career experts to politicians and parents emphasizing the importance of obtaining a college diploma. That conventional wisdom isn't entirely wrong \u2014 it's just behind the times.",
      "\"The attitude was that jobs in the trades were less than desirable,\" said Angie Hicks, co-founder of Angi, an online home improvement services guide told CBS News.",
      "But several factors are contributing to a shift in how people are thinking about such occupations. For one, going to college for many Americans often requires going into debt. The average cost of college, including tuition and room and board, now tops\u00a0$38,000 a year and is approaching $60,000 for private institutions, according to the Education Data Initiative.",
      "Factoring in the added burden of interest on student loans and potential income one foregoes while in school, the total cost of earning a bachelor's degree can exceed $500,000, the research firm has found.",
      "More recently, economists also point to a jump in unemployment for recent college grads, which some experts say is an early warning sign that AI is taking jobs away from less experienced workers. The jobless rate for 23-to-27-year-old college grads this year now hovers around 4.6%, up from 3.2% for the same demographic in 2019.",
      "Strikingly, non-college-educated workers in the same age range have experienced a much smaller uptick in unemployment, at roughly 0.5%, over the same period, according to an analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "\"AI can't go out in the field\"",
      "Vinnie Curcie, founder and CEO of OC Solar, a solar installation company in Irvine, California, said the solar energy field differs from other trades in that the work requires time both in the office and in the field. OC Solar offers three main services \u2014 solar panel and battery sales, project management and installation services. But he expects AI will soon handle much of the sales and project management sides of the business.",
      "While prospective employees once tended to have stronger interest in the company's marketing, management or other white-collar roles, more job candidates today are eager for roles in the field.",
      "\"More people are interested in the field because they know that's where the job security is,\" Curcie told CBS News.",
      "Some school districts also report seeing growing student interest in blue-collar careers. Marlo Loria, director of career and technical education and innovative partnerships at Mesa Public Schools in Mesa, Arizona, said more of her students are enrolling in schools' welding, construction and auto shop programs than there is space for.",
      "Asay, of Advantage Reline, added that students with an entrepreneurial bent can also be well-suited for the skilled trades.",
      "\"They can take their skills and create their own business, or become a bigger part of our business, outside of being someone with a shovel in a trench,\" he said.",
      "Palmer said his business generated $90,000 in revenue in its first year and is on track to top $150,000 in 2025, a more than 30% increase \u2014 no college degree needed. The other upside to life as an electrician, as he sees it, is the job security.",
      "\"I don't feel overly threatened by the growth of AI in my industry. That will be a pretty impressive robot that can do my job one day, if it ever happens,\" Palmer said.",
      "Kayden Evans, an 18-year-old senior at Mountain View High School in Mesa, Arizona, has his eyes set on a career working with his hands, and to eventually start his own business. Currently an intern at Empire Cat, a company that sells, rents and services heavy equipment and tractors, he plans on going straight from high school into an apprenticeship with the company.",
      "\"I wouldn't say I am worried about AI because where I want to grow is as a field technician, and even though it helps, I don't think AI can take that over,\" he said. \"AI can't go out in the field and take apart an engine.\"",

      "In a 161-page decision, U.S. District Judge William Young delivered a blistering assessment of the Trump administration's efforts to pursue international students who expressed pro-Palestinian views on college campuses, which he said was constitutionally protected speech.",
      "The judge, appointed by former President Ronald Reagan, was unsparing not only in his views of Noem and Rubio's actions, but also of President Trump, who he said approves of \"truly scandalous and unconstitutional suppression of free speech\" on the part of two senior administration officials.",
      "\"The president's palpable misunderstanding that the government simply cannot seek retribution for speech he disdains poses a great threat to Americans' freedom of speech,\" he wrote.",
      "Of Noem and Rubio, as well as other administration officials, Young wrote that they \"acted in concert to misuse the sweeping powers of their respective offices to target noncitizen pro-Palestinians for deportation primarily on account of their First Amendment protected political speech,\" and did so through targeted deportation proceedings aimed at pro-Palestinian student activists across the country, which \"continues unconstitutionally to chill freedom of speech to this day.\"",
      "In response to Young's decision, Tommy Pigott, a spokesperson for the State Department, said, \"The United States is under no obligation to allow foreign aliens to come to our country, commit acts of anti-American, pro-terrorist, and antisemitic hate, or incite violence. We will continue to revoke the visas of those who put the safety of our citizens at risk.\"",
      "The judge issued his decision after holding a nine-day trial that examined whether the administration had violated the free speech rights of academic associations that sued the Trump administration for arrests, detentions and deportations of foreign students and faculty who participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations.",
      "Young praised the witnesses who testified on behalf of the government, saying of them that they were \"decent, credible, dedicated nonpartisan professionals. True patriots who, in order to do their duty, have been weaponized by their highest superiors to reach foregone conclusions for most ignoble ends.\"",
      "But he accused Rubio and Noem of acting with \"invidious\" intent: \"to target a few for speaking out and then use the full rigor of the Immigration and Nationality Act (in ways it had never been used before) to have them publicly deported with the goal of tamping down pro-Palestinian student protests and terrorizing similarly situated non-citizen (and other) pro-Palestinians into silence because their views were unwelcome.\"",
      "Young further chastised the Trump administration for deploying masked agents to detain students like Tufts University doctoral student and Turkish native Rumeysa Ozturk, who was taken into custody by masked, plainclothes immigration authorities in March and spent more than a month and a half in federal immigration custody before lawyers secured her release from detention.",
      "\"This Court has listened carefully to the reasons given by \u00d6zt\u00fcrk's captors for masking-up and has heard the same reasons advanced by the defendant Todd Lyons, Acting Director of ICE. It rejects this testimony as disingenuous, squalid and dishonorable. ICE goes masked for a single reason \u2014 to terrorize Americans into quiescence,\" Young wrote. \"To us, masks are associated with cowardly desperados and the despised Ku Klux Klan. In all our history we have never tolerated an armed masked secret police.\"",
      "In response to Young's criticism of federal immigration agents wearing masks, Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, attacked the judge, calling him \"craven,\" and said officers wear masks to protect themselves.",
      "\"Our ICE law enforcement should be thanked for risking their lives every day to arrest dangerous criminals,\" she said in a statement. \"It's stunning that even after the terrorist attack and recent arrests of rioters with guns outside of ICE facilities, this Judge decides to stoke the embers of hatred.\"",
      "The judge on Tuesday also responded to a threat sent to his chambers, putting the anonymous threat, and his response, at the top of the opinion \u2014 an unusual, rare move.",
      "\"Trump has pardons and tanks \u2026 what do you have?\" says the post card, dated June 19 and written by hand. Young responds that \"Alone, I have nothing but my sense of duty. Together, We the People of the United States \u2014 you and me \u2014 have our magnificent Constitution,\" he writes, before delivering his opinion in the case. At the end of his opinion, Young again wrote to the person who sent the anonymous threat.",
      "\"I hope you found this helpful. Thanks for writing. It shows you care. You should,\" Young wrote.",
      "The judge then invited the anonymous sender to visit the court to watch a proceeding.",
      "While Young concluded that Noem and Rubio unconstitutionally chilled the free speech rights of pro-Palestinian students by targeting them for deportation, he ended his decision with a searing rebuke of Mr. Trump and the changes to the executive branch he has ushered in since returning to the White House in January.",
      "Noem has not yet responded to a request for comment, and Rubio has also not yet responded to a request for comment.",
      "Young accused the president of \"hollow bragging\" and said he \"ignores everything\" from the Constitution to civil laws to regulations, only to continue \"bullying on.\"",
      "Given that Mr. Trump is immune from prosecution, the judge said the president is prepared to deploy \"all the resources of the nation against obstruction.\"",
      "\"Behold President Trump's successes in limiting free speech \u2014 law firms cower, institutional leaders in higher education meekly appease the President, media outlets from huge conglomerates to small niche magazines mind the bottom line rather than the ethics of journalism,\" Young wrote.",
      "In July, Paramount, the parent company of CBS News, settled a lawsuit brought by Mr. Trump over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Kamala Harris for $16 million.",
      "The judge said Mr. Trump \"meets dissent from his orders in those other two branches by demonizing and disparaging the speakers, sometimes descending to personal vitriol,\" calling those he dislikes \"traitors.\"",
      "But Young praises the judiciary for rebuffing the Trump administration in its efforts to infringe on the First Amendment rights of those he dislikes, from law firms who challenged executive orders targeting them, to universities like Harvard that have been punished by the administration to news outlets like the Associated Press.",
      "\"I fear President Trump believes the American people are so divided that today they will not stand up, fight for, and defend our most precious constitutional values so long as they are lulled into thinking their own personal interests are not affected,\" Young writes in closing. \"Is he correct?\"",
      "Young was appointed by Reagan to the federal bench in 1985 and called the case involving the administration's efforts to punish pro-Palestinian activists \"perhaps the most important\" to fall within the jurisdiction of the district court in Massachusetts.",
      "Jake Rosen is a reporter covering the Department of Justice. He was previously a campaign digital reporter covering President Trump's 2024 campaign and also served as an associate producer for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\""

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/catastrophe-bonds-insurance/",
    "published": "Tue, 30 Sep 2025 20:11:39 -0400",
    "summary": "The interest in catastrophe bonds comes as insured property losses increased from $30 billion in 2015 to over $110 billion in 2024.",
    "story": [
      "In many communities at high risk for natural disasters, a Wall Street financing tool that's gaining popularity, called a catastrophe bond, may make it easier for homeowners to get insurance. On Oak Island, North Carolina, homeowners who face annual hurricane risk are seeing the impacts firsthand.",
      "The interest in catastrophe bonds comes as insured property losses increased from $30 billion in 2015 to over $110 billion in 2024, adjusted for inflation, the Insurance Information Institute found, while homeowner insurance premiums increased 40% faster than inflation between 2017 and 2022, according to the Consumer Federation of America. Many insurance companies have left high-risk markets altogether.",
      "Catastrophe bonds are contingent on whether or not a disaster takes place. Insurance companies sponsor bonds that are then purchased by investors, typically institutional investors. If a natural disaster does not take place, investors get a return on their investment. But if a disaster meeting certain thresholds takes place, money goes to insurance companies to pay out customers' claims, and investors lose money. Catastrophe bonds are beneficial to insurers because they make large amounts of capital available to pay insurance claims. The bonds are appealing to investors because disasters that lead to insurance payouts are rare.",
      "Catastrophe bonds cover a wide range of disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes and pandemics. But most catastrophe bonds have specific requirements on the degree of disaster before they are \"triggered\" to pay out to insurance companies. For instance, hurricanes may be required to reach a certain category of intensity, and floods may have to reach a certain height in order for investors to lose money. Many catastrophe bonds also require a certain amount of financial losses before they begin paying out.",
      "On Oak Island, a catastrophe bond sponsored by the North Carolina Insurance Underwriting Association is helping fund insurance and hurricane resilience projects. One such project is for local resident Paige Morgan's home, installing a fortified roof meant to withstand hurricanes and other extreme weather.",
      "\"If you're not prepared for something like this, you're taking a huge risk,\" she told CBS News. \"I've seen families lose their whole house, everything in it, with these last few storms\".",
      "Using catastrophe bonds to fund weather resilience upgrades is a new model for the industry. Gina Hardy, CEO of NCIUA, added a provision to her company's bond so that when investors profit, some of their proceeds go toward funding weather resilience upgrades like those on Morgan's home.",
      "\"When you put on a fortified roof, it reduces your probability of loss by 62%, so the more fortified roofs that we can get on, the less claims that we have,\" she said.",
      "For NCIUA, catastrophe bonds have become an important part of making sure insurance is affordable to its clients. NCIUA is North Carolina's insurer of last resort and has sponsored catastrophe bonds since 2009. Their catastrophe bonds have never been triggered, but if there were ever a severe disaster, the funding would be vital.",
      "\"If you have a Katrina that happens to hit, or a Cat. Five that hits North Carolina, we need to have enough funding to be able to pay claims, and so we go out to worldwide markets to obtain that funding,\" Hardy told CBS News. \"Catastrophe bonds are a way to get investors to provide additional protection for the citizens of North Carolina.\"",
      "For catastrophe bond investors, choosing bonds and calculating risk for investing has become a science. In April, King Ridge Capital Advisors launched a catastrophe bond exchange-traded fund. The ETF is the first way for the public to invest in catastrophe bonds, which were previously only tradable by institutional investors.",
      "Vijay Manghnani, managing partner at King Ridge Capital Advisors, has a PhD in oceanography and meteorology, and uses his scientific background to help determine which catastrophe bonds fit in King Ridge Capital Advisors' portfolio.",
      "\"When we look at hurricane risk, we are actually studying hurricane risk for the last 150 years. We pull through the data, we build models that not only take all that into account, but actually look forward, we bring in climate change risk to it,\" he told CBS News.",
      "If the catastrophe bond triggers fit the firm's tolerance for risk, they invest.",
      "Catastrophe bonds have performed well in recent years. In 2024, the catastrophe bond market netted a 17% return, according to Swiss Re.",
      "For investors, the main benefit is that catastrophe bond returns are not correlated to the market, and therefore are unaffected by shocks to the economy. That theory was put to the test earlier this year when the White House levied tariffs.",
      "\"We launched our ETF on April 1, which was the day before the tariffs were rolled out, and for the month of April, we were one of the few securities that actually made profit,\" Manghnani said."

      "Officials said the servers were so powerful they could have disabled cell phone towers and launched distributed denial of services attacks with the ability to block emergency communications like EMS and police dispatch. An official briefed on the investigation told reporters that the sophisticated network \"could text message the entire country within 12 minutes\" and added that \"this was well organized and well funded.\"",

    "summary": "Some people taking out a home loan and purchasing flood insurance could face delays if the U.S. government shuts down this week.",
    "story": [
      "Americans worried that a looming U.S.\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0could derail their plans to take out a mortgage or refinance their home loan can breathe easy \u2014 mostly. Housing experts says lenders will continue processing mortgages as usual even if federal agencies close shop, while noting that a shutdown could lead to hitches for borrowers applying for government-backed loans.",
      "\"If you're expecting to close in a week or a month, there could be some slight delay,\" said Jeff Ostrowski, a housing analyst at Bankrate. \"But I think for most people, it's probably going to be a blip more than a real deal killer.\"",
      "The bulk of the mortgage market consists of loans originated by private lenders. But some government agencies have a hand in the process, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insuring private loans or Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) managing flood insurance policies.",
      "Impact on government-backed loans",
      "Borrowers applying for a conventional mortgage issued by a bank, credit union or other private lender are unlikely to encounter problems if the government closes shop. However, those applying for government-backed loans from agencies like the FHA, Department of Veteran Affairs an Department of Agriculture (USDA) could face minor delays lining up their mortgages, Holden Lewis, a senior writer at NerdWallet, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The National Association of Realtors (NAR) notes in an online\u00a0explainer\u00a0that the FHA will continue to approve most single-family mortgage loans in the event of a shutdown. The VA will also continue to guarantee home loans, but worker furloughs at the agency could lead to processing delays, the group said.",
      "\"It creates a little bit of extra stress and uncertainty, but I haven't seen a shutdown in either of those programs\" when politics led the government to shut it doors in the past, Ostrowski said.",
      "The VA and FHA account for up to a quarter of all mortgage applications, according to\u00a0Redfin. NAR\u00a0advises\u00a0U.S. veterans applying for or refinancing a government-backed loan to check with their lender on how long it will take to complete the process if the government shuts down.",
      "Another segment of the housing market that could feel the impact of a shutdown are people applying for mortgages through the USDA, which issues loans to buyers in eligible towns and rural areas. NAR\u00a0said the USDA will halt issuance of new direct and guaranteed home loans during a shutdown. Pre-scheduled direct\u2011loan closings will also be postponed.",
      "The USDA did not respond to a request for comment. The VA referred CBS News to its shutdown contingency plan, which says the agency will continue issuing \"housing benefits.\"",
      "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored entities that support roughly 70% of the mortgage market, don't rely on federal funding and have continued to operate during past shutdowns. However, they could face bottlenecks if federal agencies close down this week, said Anthony Smith, an applied economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"They rely on other federal processes like the IRS for tax transcript verifications,\" he said. \"So if the IRS shuts down or significantly cuts back on its transcript services, then Fannie and Freddie might be able to approve a loan, but they can't get the final verification piece.\"",
      "Possible flood insurance delays",
      "People purchasing a house in a flood zone could also face delays during a government shutdown, experts told CBS News. That's because homebuyers applying for a federally backed mortgage in high-risk flood areas are required to get flood insurance. A shutdown could hamper the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program, which underwrites more than 4 million flood insurance policies in the U.S.",
      "\"The government shutdown could complicate your closing because it might be harder to just secure flood insurance,\" Ostrowski told CBS News.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "According to the White House, the flood insurance program cannot sell new or renewal insurance policies during a government shutdown.\"A potential lapse of the NFIP authorization would negatively impact many thousands of Americans who would be left unable to renew/transfer their coverage or to buy the required coverage for their homes,\" a White House official said in an email.",

    "story": [
      "A government shutdown on Wednesday would have the potential to disrupt a multitude of federal activities \u2014 but people with student loans are expected to continue making their repayments, according to the U.S. Department of Education.",
      "People with student loans \"will still be required to make payments on their outstanding student debt,\" the Education Department said in a Sept. 28 contingency plan for an Oct. 1 federal shutdown.",
      "While loans are still due for repayment, it could be hard to reach someone at the Education Department if a problem arises given that most of its employees are scheduled to be furloughed in case of a shutdown, said Persis Yu, managing counsel at Protect Borrowers, an advocacy group for people with student loans.",
      "\"Student loan borrowers will still need to pay their bills during a shutdown,\" Yu told CBS News. \"However, if things go wrong with their servicer, which they often do, borrowers are going to have fewer people to turn to to get those errors resolved.\"",
      "There would also likely be little impact on federal aid, such as loans and grants, for students who are currently enrolled in colleges and university programs because most payments are disbursed at the start of the academic year, according to a statement from the American Council on Education, a higher-education advocacy group.",
      "Still, some borrowers and students in the applications stage could encounter hurdles during a shutdown, the group added.",
      "\"Borrowers seeking assistance from [the Education Department] may face delays, and loan forgiveness applications could be impacted if the shutdown persists,\" the American Council on Education said.",
      "The Education Department operates the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which is aimed at helping public workers \u2014 such as teachers and police officers \u2014 discharge their federal student loans after they've served in government or not-for-profit organizations for more than 10 years.",
      "The DOE also runs income-driven repayment plans that provide forgiveness after 20 - 25 years of repayment.",
      "About 2,100 of the Education Department's roughly 2,400 employees are expected to be furloughed if the government shuts down on Wednesday, according to the agency's contingency plan. Those include most of the agency's Office of Federal Student Aid, the plan shows.",
      "Could Pell Grants or the FAFSA be impacted?",
      "The Education Department said it would continue to disburse student aid such as Pell Grants and Federal Direct Student loans in the event of a shutdown because those programs are funded through mandatory spending or carryover appropriations, and therefore don't require approval from Congress.",
      "\"More than 9.9 million students receive student aid, in the form of grants and loans, at approximately 5,400 schools through these programs,\" the agency noted.",
      "The DOE said it plans to use permanent appropriations to continue processing student aid requests through the Free Applications for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, which opened on Sept. 24 for the 2026-27 academic year. The FAFSA is used by parents and students to apply for loans, grants and work-study funds to pay for college or career training programs.",
      "\"FAFSA applications actually opened early, with the form becoming fully available as of Sept. 24,\" rather than the traditional opening day of Oct. 1, NerdWallet lending expert Kate Wood told CBS News. \"Students shouldn't expect delays or for deadlines to be pushed back. Unless the Education Department says otherwise, there's no reason to wait to file the FAFSA.\"",
      "Funding for Title I and IDEA grants, which are for low-income schools and disabled students, respectively, would also continue to be available, it added.",
      "Likewise, most GI Bill benefits for students who are veterans should also continue without disruption if the government shuts down because the program is funded by mandatory spending that doesn't need to be re-approved by Congress, according to the American Council on Education, which cited the Department of Veterans Affairs' contingency plan.",
      "\"However, some delays [for ex-military students] could arise if the shutdown is prolonged or if students require additional verification, corrections or appeals during the lapse,\" the ACE noted.",
      "It added, \"In previous shutdowns, VA has experienced backlogs in claims processing and a slowdown in support services due to furloughed staff and reduced system capacity.\"",
      "What Education Department activities would be impacted?",
      "New grants would be halted during a government shutdown, the Education Department noted. But since most grants are awarded over the summer, only a small number of recipients would likely be impacted, it added.",
      "\"Grantees will continue to be able to draw down funds from these awards and, therefore, the impacts on schools and students should be minimal,\" the agency said. \"The Office for Civil Rights would pause its review and investigations of civil rights complaints.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The federal government will begin shutting down at 12 a.m. on Wednesday if lawmakers do not reach an agreement to extend government funding, an outcome that appears more and more likely as the deadline approaches.",
      "Republicans and Democrats have been at odds over how to fund the government as Democrats have pushed for negotiations over health care tax credits to be included in a funding measure. Without an extension or approval of another funding bill, spending authority is set to expire, sending the federal government into a shutdown.",
      "Each agency and department would begin shutdown procedures on Wednesday morning, leading to hundreds of thousands of workers being placed on furlough. Essential employees will stay on the job, but nearly all employees, whether furloughed or not, will go without pay for the duration of the funding lapse.",
      "The likely shutdown is the result of weeks of disagreements between Republicans and Democrats in Washington over funding the government. Here's the back story:",
      "How Congress funds the government",
      "Each year, Congress faces a deadline to approve government funding by the start of a new fiscal year on Oct. 1. The Constitution outlines that Congress must approve any money spent by the federal government. Bills to approve that spending must originate in the House, pass the Senate and be signed by the president before departments and agencies can use the funds.",
      "The government funding process often stretches late into the fiscal year, and in recent decades Congress has nearly always resorted to stopgap measures to keep the government funded in order to give lawmakers more time to approve new spending.",
      "The funding fights often go down to the wire, as the minority looks to use its leverage to extract concessions. But lawmakers also have strong incentives to avoid shutdowns, since they can be economically and politically costly. The last funding lapse stretched from December 2018 until January 2019 and caused a permanent loss of about $3 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The 2025 funding fight",
      "This time around, Democrats have refused to help Republicans in the majority extend government funding without addressing health insurance subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year. Republicans have been steadfast in their belief that health care and other issues should be negotiated outside the context of funding the government, and urged Democrats to agree to a temporary funding extension.",
      "On Sept. 19, House Republicans passed what's known as a continuing resolution to keep the government funded at existing levels until Nov. 21. Republicans touted the \"clean\" continuing resolution that would give lawmakers more time to work out full-year spending bills. But Democrats insisted that Republicans negotiate with them on the funding plan to earn their support.",
      "Although Republicans have majorities in the House and Senate, most legislation in the upper chamber is subject to a 60-vote threshold to advance. With 53 Republicans, Democratic support is necessary.",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats pushed their own proposal to avert a shutdown with a bill that would keep the government funded until Oct. 31. Their bill also includes a number of their priorities, including a permanent extension of enhanced tax credits for Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, which became a red line for their support.",
      "Both the House-passed bill and the Democratic proposal fell short in the Senate, as the two parties became locked in a stalemate over the funding plan. And a decision by House GOP leaders to keep the House away from Washington until after the funding deadline has all but ruled out alternate paths forward.",
      "A meeting between President Trump and the congressional leaders on Monday failed to yield an agreement, with the two sides trading blame for what appears to be an inevitable shutdown.",
      "What happens during a shutdown",
      "Should the government shut down, lawmakers will have to agree to a spending bill to eventually reopen the government.",
      "In the meantime, federal agencies will be forced to halt non-essential functions. The Congressional Budget Office estimated on Tuesday that about 750,000 federal employees could be furloughed, though they would receive back pay at the end of a shutdown. The total daily cost of their compensation would be around $400 million. The budget office noted that the effects of a shutdown \"depend on its duration and on an Administration's decisions about how to proceed.\"",
      "Among those employees who are deemed essential are active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency decides which employees are essential. Tens of thousands of others can stay on the job because their pay is funded through other means, like other legislation or fees.",

    "published": "Tue, 30 Sep 2025 15:36:00 -0400",
    "summary": "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has floated the idea of adding autism to the list of conditions covered by the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. What would that mean?",
    "story": [
      "Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has floated a seismic idea: adding autism to the list of conditions covered by the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. The program, known as VICP, provides a system for families to file claims against vaccine providers in cases where they experience severe side effects. Kennedy has also suggested broadening the definitions of two serious brain conditions \u2014 encephalopathy and encephalitis \u2014 so that autism cases could qualify.",
      "Either move, experts warn, would unleash a flood of claims, threatening the program's financial stability and handing vaccine opponents a powerful new talking point.",
      "Legally, HHS \"is required to undergo notice and comment rulemaking to revise the table,\" said Richard Hughes, a law firm partner who teaches at George Washington University. The \"table\" is a list of specific injuries that the U.S. government accepts as presumed to be caused by a vaccine if those injuries occur within a certain time window. If someone can show they meet these criteria, they have a simpler path to securing compensation without having to prove fault. Autism is not in the table because a link between vaccines and autism has been thoroughly debunked.",
      "If autism is added, Hughes explained, the VICP could face \"an exorbitant number of claims that would threaten the viability of the program.\"",
      "Asked about its possible plans, an HHS spokesperson told CBS News the agency does not comment on future or potential policy decisions.",
      "Carole Johnson, former administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, which oversees VICP, cautioned that the system is already overburdened: \"The backlog is not just a function of management, it's built into the statute itself. That's important context for any conversation about adding new categories of claims.\"",
      "Dorit Reiss, a law professor at UC Law San Francisco, said that any such change would be exploited: \"This can, and likely will, be used to cast doubt on vaccines.\"",
      "Compensation without causation",
      "The Vaccine Injury Compensation Program was born of crisis. In 1982, \"Vaccine Roulette,\" a television documentary, aired nationwide, alleging routine childhood shots were causing seizures, brain damage and even sudden infant death. The program alarmed parents and triggered a surge of lawsuits against vaccine makers.",
      "\"That led to a flood of litigation against vaccine makers,\" recalled Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and vaccine inventor at the University of Pennsylvania. \"I mean, to the point that it drove them out of the business. \u2026 By the mid-1980s, there were $3.2 billion worth of lawsuits against these companies.\"",
      "Were it not for the VICP, said Offit, \"We wouldn't have vaccines for American children. The companies \u2014 it wasn't worth it for them.\"",
      "The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 created a no-fault system. Families who believed a vaccine caused harm could file a claim; if the injury appeared on the table within a set time frame, compensation was automatic. If not, claimants could present medical evidence. The system had two purposes: provide compensation and protect the vaccine supply.",
      "From the beginning, the table was understood not as a scientific document, but a legal tool.",
      "\"It's a legal document and things can be included for policy reasons even if the causation evidence is weak.\" said Reiss. She explained, \"The program is designed to be generous, to compensate in cases of doubt.\"",
      "But, she said, \"autism is not in that category. The science is clear. Adding it would be pure politics.\"",
      "This tension \u2014 between law, science and public perception \u2014 has defined the program for nearly four decades.",
      "What expansion would mean in practice",
      "Since 1988, federal data shows more than 25,000 petitions to the VICP have been adjudicated; of those, 12,019 were granted compensation and 13,007 were dismissed. About 60% of compensated cases involved negotiated settlements in which HHS drew no conclusion about the cause. Over that same period, billions of doses of vaccines were safely administered to millions of Americans.",
      "Adding autism to the VICP table would change that picture overnight.",
      "Federal estimates suggest up to 48,000 children could qualify immediately under a \"profound autism\" standard, with potential payouts averaging $2 million per case, at an initial cost of nearly $100 billion, followed by annual totals of about $30 billion a year \u2014 dwarfing the current $4 billion trust, a new analysis finds.",
      "\"Any case where the symptoms appeared in the past eight years and the parents blame vaccines,\" said Reiss. \"I don't know how many that would be. The fund has a surplus of over $4 billion. One seriously disabled child's care can cost millions, so a significant number, say 100,000 compensations, might exhaust it.\"",
      "Furthermore, with only eight special masters handling cases, the system would also be paralyzed by backlogs.",
      "The stakes are not just fiscal. If the fund collapses under the weight of autism claims, vaccine makers may question whether producing vaccines for the U.S. market is worth the risk. That would mirror the crisis of the 1980s, which led to the establishment of the VICP.",
      "Autism and the courts",
      "In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Dr. Andrew Wakefield's now-retracted paper alleging a link between the MMR vaccine and autism fueled a surge of VICP claims. By 2002, the VICP was swamped with petitions alleging vaccines had caused autism. The court consolidated thousands of cases into the Omnibus Autism Proceedings, selecting a handful of test cases to decide them all.",
      "After years of hearings and expert testimony, the conclusion was unequivocal: vaccines do not cause autism. In 2010, the court ruled against petitioners on every theory of causation. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims affirmed, and the Court of Appeals upheld the decision.",
      "\"That precedent is binding,\" said Richard Hughes, a vaccine law expert at George Washington University and former VICP legal counsel. \"Autism was litigated thoroughly and rejected. That still carries weight in the court today.\"",
      "The ghost of Hannah Poling",
      "Yet, the vaccine-autism debate has never quite faded. In 2008, the government conceded a case involving Hannah Poling, a girl with a rare mitochondrial disorder who developed autism-like symptoms after vaccination. Officials stressed the concession was specific to her condition, not evidence of a general link. But headlines told another story: \"Family to Receive $1.5 Million in First-Ever Vaccine Autism Court Award.\"",
      "The Poling case fueled years of confusion.",
      "Autism science today",
      "The science is clearer than ever. Autism begins early in pregnancy, not in toddlerhood when most vaccines are given.",
      "\"Vaccinations \u2026 happened around the time families were recognizing symptoms of autism in their children,\" said Dr. Catherine Lord, a UCLA clinical psychologist and specialist in autism diagnosis. \"However, we now know that autism begins much earlier, likely as the fetus develops during pregnancy, so it cannot be an explanation.\"",
      "Dr. Peter Hotez, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and vaccine scientist at the Baylor College of Medicine who is also the father of a young adult with autism, underscores that point: \"The drivers of autism are genetics and, in rare cases, environmental exposures during pregnancy, not vaccines. We've been over this ground for decades, and the evidence is overwhelming.\"",
      "Sarah Despres, former legal counsel to the secretary of Health and Human Services in the Biden Administration and now a consultant to nonprofit organizations on immunization policy, adds that the compensation program itself is often misunderstood.",
      "\"The table was originally written as a political document,\" she said. \"The purpose of the program was to be swift, generous, and fair. \u2026 There would be cases that may not be caused by the vaccine, but would be compensated if you went through this table injury scheme where you don't have to prove causation.\"",
      "What's at risk: Harm from the diseases themselves",
      "The stakes are not abstract. Measles, one of the most contagious pathogens on earth, spreads so efficiently that one infected child can transmit it to 90% of susceptible contacts. Before vaccination in the 1960s, measles sickened millions annually in the U.S., killing hundreds and causing thousands of cases of encephalitis and lifelong disability. Complications included pneumonia, brain swelling, and in rare cases, a fatal degenerative brain disorder called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) that can strike years later. Earlier this year, a school-age child in Los Angeles County died of SSPE after contracting measles in infancy, before being eligible for vaccination.",
      "Mumps was once a near-universal childhood illness. Though often dismissed as mild, it can cause sterility in men, meningitis, and permanent hearing loss. Outbreaks on college campuses, as recently as the 2000s, showed how quickly it can return when vaccination rates slip.",
      "Rubella, also known as German measles, is mild in most children, but devastating in pregnancy. Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS) caused waves of tragedy before the vaccine: thousands of babies each year born blind, deaf, with heart defects or with intellectual disabilities. In medical texts, autism itself is listed as one of CRS's sequelae, or possible consequences \u2014 proof that rubella infection, not vaccination, can contribute to developmental disorders.",
      "Measles, mumps and rubella \"are not trivial,\" said Dr. Walt Orenstein, former head of CDC's immunization program. \"Fever, high fever, is common \u2026 and they have frequent complications.\"",
      "And yet, as these diseases fade from living memory, a counter-narrative has gained traction. On Sept. 29, the nonprofit Physicians for Informed Consent, a group that disputes the scientific consensus on vaccines,\u00a0 announced it had mailed its \"Silver Booklet\" on vaccine safety to every member of Congress, as well as to President Trump and Vice President JD Vance. The book claims that \"vaccines are not proven to be safer than the diseases they intend to prevent,\" and calls on federal leaders to punish states that restrict vaccine exemptions. (The booklet isn't free. The group sells copies for $25 on Amazon.)",
      "Scientists say this framing misrepresents the basic math of risk. \"Measles is one of the most important infectious diseases in human history,\" notes \"Plotkin's Vaccines,\" the field's authoritative textbook. \"The widespread use of measles vaccines in the late 20th and early 21st centuries led to a further marked reduction in measles deaths. Measles vaccination averted an estimated 31.7 million deaths from 2000 to 2020.\"",
      "Kennedy's possible move to expand the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program hinges on casting doubt \u2014 on suggesting that science is unsettled, that vaccines may be riskier than diseases.",
      "\"One tactic used to argue that vaccines cause autism is the use of compensation decisions from the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program to claim such a link,\" said Reiss of UC Law San Francisco. \"Even the cases that most closely address the question of vaccines and autism do not show the link that opponents claim exists, and many of the cases used are misrepresented and misused.\"",
      "Offit underscores the danger on the perception side. \"When people see the Vaccine Injury Compensation program, they assume that any money that is given is because there was a vaccine injury,\" he said.",
      "Dr. Kathryn Edwards, an expert in pediatric infectious diseases and vaccine safety at Vanderbilt University, said, \"Expanding compensation for issues that are not clearly related to vaccines \u2026 suggests that these conditions are related to vaccines when they are not.\" She compared it to the removal of thimerosal, a preservative dropped from most childhood vaccines to ease public fears, despite no evidence of harm. \"Now, we are still suffering from that action.\"",
      "Public health experts stress that such narratives invert reality. The very diseases being downplayed once killed or disabled tens of thousands of American children each year. As pediatrician, psychiatrist, and medical historian Dr. Howard Markel put it: \"Back a hundred years ago, everybody lost a kid or knew a kid who died of one of these diseases. \u2026 We never conquer germs, we wrestle them to a draw. That's the best we do. And so this is a real \u2026 handicap to the other side, the microbes who live to infect.\"",
      "Families and the future",
      "The hardest voices to reckon with are those of families. Parents of autistic children often feel abandoned \u2014 unsupported by disability programs, exhausted by care needs, searching for answers. Kennedy's appeal to them is emotional, not scientific.",
      "Reiss noted that families deserve far more support, but argues that it shouldn't come through VICP.",
      "\"The program is to award compensation to those injured by vaccines,\" she said. \"We should have more direct support \u2014 disability funding, disability aid. Kennedy has been taking HHS in the opposite direction, cutting services where we need more.\"",
      "Despres made the same point: \"The goal of the program really was if there's a close call, we're going to err on the side of compensation. \u2026 And it's really important that everyone understands that compensation does not mean that the vaccine actually caused the injury. \u2026 And I think we have seen statistics around the compensation program misused by those who would want to sow distrust in vaccines, to say vaccines are unsafe, when in fact \u2026 that's not what this is.\"",
      "UCLA's Lord urged a shift in focus. \"For the last 50 years science has focused on the biological causes of autism, which has led to great progress, especially in genetics,\" she said. Of Secretary Kennedy, she said, \"he could help more by acknowledging the value of science, but also the need to better attend to the actual lives of autistic people and their families.\"",
      "What comes next?",
      "If Kennedy decides to move forward with such a plan, HHS would need to draft a rule, open it to public comment and then defend the change in court. The pushback will be fierce: from scientists, from public health leaders and from families who fear being misled yet again.",
      "The debate over adding autism to the Vaccine Injury Table is not just a policy debate. The program was built on the principle of compensation without causation, a fragile balance designed to sustain both trust and supply. Adding autism could collapse that distinction entirely.",

    "story": [
      "Everyone is now accounted for in the aftermath of a shooting and fire at a Michigan church during Sunday services, authorities said during a press conference Monday. The FBI is investigating the Grand Blanc Township melee as \"an act of targeted violence.\"",
      "About 100 people were inside the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on McClandlish Road around 10:25 a.m. Sunday\u00a0when the shooting happened.",
      "The suspect, identified as a 40-year-old\u00a0Thomas Jacob Sanford of Burton, Michigan, drove his vehicle through the front doors of the church, exited his vehicle and fired \"several rounds\" of an assault rifle at hundreds of churchgoers, Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye said.",
      "\"This was an evil act of violence. That's exactly what this was,\" Renye said.",
      "Four victims were killed in the shootings. The shooter is also dead, officials said. Two victims remain in critical condition at an area hospital, and six others were reported to be in stable condition, according to hospital officials. Henry Ford Genesys Hospital said it provided care for some of the victims.",
      "The victims range in age from 6 to 78 years old. Henry Ford officials say that of the eight victims, five were treated for gunshot wounds and three were treated for smoke inhalation.",
      "Monday's press conference was the final in a series of in-person reports, with local police saying additional updates will come from their social media. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was among those who spoke Monday, alongside FBI Detroit acting special agent in charge Reuben C. Coleman, Genesee County Sheriff Christopher R. Swanson, ATF special agent in charge of the Detroit Field Office James Deir and Michigan State Police Director Col. James F. Grady II.",
      "Deir asked that area residents avoid the area near the church, which has been blocked off, asking for cooperation from the public as investigators continue to comb through the wreckage left by the fire. Over 100 victims and witnesses have been interviewed so far, Coleman said. Numerous special teams from state and federal agencies are working on the case, including a National Response Team from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.",
      "In the meantime, the authorities praised the dedication of first responders and law enforcement at the scene, some of whom had only two months experience on the job, along with the immediate response of the church attendees during the incident.",
      "\"There are noble heroes who do not wear a uniform that went to that church yesterday .... Those heroes from that church did their job,\" the sheriff said.",
      "Survivor Paul Kirby told \"CBS Mornings\" it was \"the scariest moment of my life, not knowing if my family was OK.\" Kirby's wife and children were with him, attending a service at the church, when they heard \"a loud boom coming from the back wall of the chapel.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said investigators were looking into how much planning went into the attack and whether any clues about the motive were left behind.",
      "\"From what I understand, based on my conversations with the FBI director, all they know right now is this was an individual who hated people of the Mormon faith,\" she said Monday.",
      "The shooting occurred a day after Russell M. Nelson, the oldest-ever president of the Utah-based faith, died at 101.",
      "Sanford was an Iraq war veteran who deployed once for several months during 2007 and 2008, according to service records provided to CBS News by the Pentagon. Sanford served in the Marines for four years.",
      "Crews in white coveralls and hard hats searched through what remained of the church on Monday morning. A silver pickup truck with two American flags in the back remained where it had smashed into the front brick wall near a sign that says \"visitors welcome.\"",
      "U.S. officials and state lawmakers shared messages in response to the shooting, and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer ordered U.S. and Michigan flags to be lowered to half-staff through Friday to honor and remember the victims.",
      "Grand Blanc Community Schools were closed on Monday.",
      "Bloomfield Township Police says it will \"increase patrols around our places of worship and other community gatherings to help ensure a safe environment for everyone.\"",
      "The shooting was the latest of several attacks on houses of worship in the U.S. over the past 20 years, including one in August that killed two children at the Church of the Annunciation in Minneapolis.",

    "summary": "With time running out to avert a government shutdown, millions of Americans who get health insurance under the Affordable Care Act could soon face sharply higher premiums.",
    "story": [
      "A possible U.S. government shutdown\u00a0on Wednesday could hinge on a deal to maintain a tax credit that helps 22 million Americans lower their health insurance costs when they buy policies through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces.",
      "Known as the enhanced premium tax credit, the subsidy has been used by millions of low- and middle-class households since it was authorized under the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021. Since then, spurred by the tax credit, the number of people who have enrolled in ACA marketplace health insurance plans has almost doubled, according to health care publication KFF.",
      "But it is set to expire at the end of 2025, and leading Democratic lawmakers are making a funding deal to keep the government open contingent on Republicans agreeing to extend the credit.",
      "Even as the outcome of the funding negotiations in Washington, D.C., remains uncertain, expiration of the premium health care credits could inflict financial pain on millions of Americans, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"Insurers are already preparing to send notices to households that they will see increases starting in January 2026,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy at Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal economic advocacy group, and former a White House economic official under former President Joe Biden, on a conference call Friday to discuss the tax credit.",
      "He added, \"People are more and more concerned about the cost of living, and [this is] a hit to their pocketbooks that they will start seeing in weeks.\"",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the enhanced ACA premium tax credits set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "How much could ACA premiums increase?",
      "The cost of premiums for people who buy their insurance through the ACA marketplaces could more than double, rising from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to a Sept. 30 analysis by KFF.\u00a0About 4 million people would likely drop their insurance coverage if the credit is allowed to expire because they would't be able to afford the costs, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The premium tax credit is aimed at people who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans, and who can't get affordable health care through an employer. The credit is available for those who earn between 100% to 400% of the poverty level, which means a family of four with annual income of up to $128,600 would qualify for the credit.",
      "With expiration of the ACA coverage credit only months away, some policy holders have already received noticed that their premiums \u2014 the monthly fee paid for insurance coverage \u2014 are poised to surge next year. Insurers have sent out notices in nearly every state, with some proposing premium increases of as much as 50%.",
      "Insurers are already planning on substantial premium hikes in 2026, according to a Peterson KFF Health System Tracker survey published last month. The poll found that 312 insurers participating in ACA marketplaces are proposing median increases of 18% next year, about 11 percentage points higher than in 2025.",
      "That increase would represent the largest rate hike since 2018, and is driven by higher costs for medical care as well as the expiration of the premium tax credits. Sharply higher ACA premiums would likely cause healthier people to drop coverage, making it more expensive to insure those who remain, the group said.",
      "The proposed hikes range from a high of 39.9%, from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma, to a low of 4.6% for Oscar Garden State Insurance Corporation, their survey found.",
      "In Iowa last month, the state's insurance commissioner weighed increases ranging from 3% to 37%, arousing public concerns. One woman who runs a garden center in Cedar Falls, Iowa, said she was considering dropping health insurance altogether.",
      "\"I am already living as frugally as I possibly can while working as hard as I possibly can, putting in as many hours as I am allowed to at my job, never missing a day of work,\" one woman, LuAnn, wrote in a comment published on the commissioner's website.",
      "Signs of financial fragility",
      "The potential hike in insurance costs comes as many Americans continue struggling with the cost of living, said Rohit Chopra, former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, on the conference call with Jacquez, organized by Groundwork, which supports extending the credits.",
      "\"Some people will need to drop their insurance all together, but households with someone with a chronic illness will have to pay those big, big increases,\" Chopra said. That would require some families to make tough financial choices, such as not paying other bills or accumulating debt to cover their expenses, he added.",
      "Although inflation around the U.S. has eased significantly since its post-pandemic peak in 2022, costs continue to inch higher. The Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target is slipping further from reach this year, with the Consumer Price Index climbing higher in recent months. Some consumers are showing signs of increasing financial stress, with credit card delinquencies on the rise and balances creeping higher.",
      "Meanwhile, many Americans aren't aware that the ACA enhanced premium tax credits will expire in a matter of months, KFF found in a survey.",
      "\"Consumers should not panic, but they do need to prepare,\" Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at insurance website Healthinsurance.org, said in an email.",
      "People should make sure to compare various plans available to them on the marketplaces and explore options such as Health Savings Plans, which allows people to set aside money to pay for medical expenses, she said.",
      "\"Being proactive will help minimize financial surprises,\" Norris said.",

That's the insight behind Dot,\" Stanley Tang, co-founder and head of DoorDash Labs, the robotic solutions arm of the business, said in a statement. \"The breakthrough wasn't just making it autonomous, but in making it reliable and efficient to serve the needs of local businesses and consumers.\"",
      "Dot can move at up to 20 miles per hour, ensuring food deliveries arrive in a speedy manner. It is also smart and nimble enough to navigate doorways and driveways, the company said. It stands about five feet tall, and can carry up to 30 pounds of merchandise.",

    "summary": "Pfizer's CEO said President Trump's threat of tariffs motivated his company to take swift action.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Pfizer has agreed to offer significantly discounted prices for some prescription drugs for all American consumers and has committed to offer prescription medications to Medicaid at lower prices, President Trump announced Tuesday. The president said the drugs will be available for purchase online on a website operated by the federal government, which the White House has said will be called \"TrumpRx.\"",
      "\"Today, I'm thrilled to announce that one of the world's largest pharmaceutical manufacturers and one of the best anywhere in the world, Pfizer, has agreed to offer countless prescription medications at major discounts in the United States, a result of the 'most favored nation' drug pricing order that we established earlier this year,\" Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office.",
      "Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, who was in the Oval Office with the president for the announcement, said Mr. Trump's threat of 100% tariffs on drugs manufactured outside the U.S. motivated his company to take swift action. The president said Pfizer's drug prices will be lower starting \"immediately.\"",
      "The president said the cost of some Pfizer drugs could see decreases in price of 50%-100%. Mr. Trump said this would save American consumers and taxpayers \"hundreds of millions of dollars a year.\" The president said Americans have been \"subsidizing research and development costs for the entire planet\" because of the higher prices they have been paying.",
      "\"We're also announcing that moving forward, all new medications introduced by Pfizer to the American market will be sold at the reduced most favored nation cost,\" the president added. \"So, we'll be paying essentially what other countries are paying, who have been much lower \u2014 much, much lower for many, many years.\"",
      "Bourla called it an \"historic day\" because Pfizer would be reversing an \"unfair situation.\"",
      "\"For years, other rich nations refused to pay their fair share for medical innovation,\" Bourla said. \"And as a result, Americans had to assume disproportionate costs.\"",
      "The Pfizer agreement is a part of the White House agenda to secure \"most favored nation\" pricing with pharmaceutical manufacturers. In May, Mr. Trump signed an executive order\u00a0calling on drugmakers to lower their prices and bring them in line with what other high-income countries pay for the same drugs. He threatened to subject them to steep caps on how much they can earn from Medicare if they failed to do so.",
      "Monday was the deadline for drugmakers to reach agreements to bring down drug costs, the Post reported, after the president's May executive order. While the U.S. has less than 5% of the world's population and uses about 13% of the world's prescription drugs, the U.S. funds over 70% of global pharmaceutical profits, according to the White House.",
      "The president's announcement comes days after he announced that on Wednesday, the U.S. would begin imposing a 100% tariff on any branded or patented pharmaceutical product \"unless a Company IS BUILDING their Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plant in America.\" That move could increase the costs of some drugs for consumers.",
      "Bourla mentioned the impending tariffs in his comments Tuesday, saying the tariffs had motivated his company. He said the Mr. Trump gave Pfizer a three-year grace period on the tariffs, and the tariffs would be inapplicable, as long as Pfizer manufactures in the U.S. As a part of the agreement, Bourla said Pfizer agreed to move their production of medicines used in America to the U.S.",
      "\"The president is absolutely right, tariff is the most powerful tool to motivate behaviors, Mr. President,\" Bourla said. \"And clearly motivated ours, right?\"",
      "Mr. Trump also said the tariffs had \"played a big role\" in the deal.",
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said more details of agreements by pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices will come this fall. Mr. Trump echoed that point, saying other companies are on board, too.",
      "\"President Trump is doing more to lower healthcare costs than anyone else in Washington, D.C.,\" said White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai ahead of the president's announcement. \"While Democrats are threatening to shut down the government to subsidize health care for illegal aliens, President Trump is leveraging the power of the federal government to drastically cut drug prices for everyday Americans. Democrats talked the talk for decades about drug prices, but only President Trump is actually walking the walk.\"",
      "Neither Pfizer nor the White House have released specific drug prices yet.",
      "The details of the \"TrumpRx\" website have not yet been shared, but a senior administration official expected the website to be live in early 2026.",
      "The announcement comes as Democrats remain at an impasse with the president and Republicans over keeping the government funded beyond midnight: they say the president is not doing enough to lower health care prices, and they've been pushing for an extension of the Affordable Care Act before premiums increase for many who have health care through the ACA.",

    "story": [
      "Even if a U.S.\u00a0government shutdown begins on Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress, with lawmakers currently at loggerheads over funding the federal government past Sept. 30.",
      "If an agreement isn't reached before then, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for their operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",

The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date.

    "summary": "\"The last thing we want to do is just keep raising prices on our guests,\" Gregory's Coffee founder Gregory Zamfotis said. That might be easier said than done.",
    "story": [
      "The first Gregory's Coffee opened in 2006 on Manhattan's Park Avenue. Nineteen years later, the family-owned business has expanded to over 54 locations around the U.S. as well as a roastery in Queens, New York, that handles coffee beans from Brazil, Rwanda, Nicaragua and other major global producers.",
      "For Gregory Zamfotis, founder of the New York City-based chain, the business is about more than just dollars and cents \u2014 it's also about recognizing the special place coffee has long had in American culture as a driver of social connections.",
      "\"Coffee is built into the fabric of our society,\" Zamfotis told CBS News. \"People come together over coffee. When it's a meeting or interview, or we just want to get some work done, coffee tends to be the centerpiece of those conversations.\"",
      "With many Americans still feeling the effects of elevated inflation, for many coffee drinkers, one of those conversations is likely to center on the drink's soaring costs.",
      "Prices have leaped nearly 21% over the past 12 months, with the average retail price of 100% ground roast coffee recently reaching a record high of $8.87 per pound, up from $7.02 in January, USDA data shows.",
      "Several factors are behind the spike in coffee prices, including droughts in Brazil and volatile weather in other regions where the bean is cultivated. More recently, heavy U.S. tariffs on coffee-producing countries \u2014 including a hefty 50% levy on Brazil \u2014 have also driven up prices.",
      "Though coffee is a staple of American daily life, the vast majority of the beans is imported. Much of that is sourced from Latin America, with Brazil alone accounting for 35%, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "By contrast, the U.S. produces relatively little coffee compared to the rest of the world. Hawaii, the top-producing state, harvested 21 million pounds during the 2024\u201325 season, according to the USDA. Yet Americans consumed a whopping 3.3 billion pounds of coffee during the same period, the agency said.",
      "\"Prices are going to have to go up\"",
      "Jake Leonti, director of coffee at Gregory's Coffee, said it's also far pricier to grow and produce coffee in the U.S.",
      "\"It's exponentially [more] expensive because it's Americans farming,\" he said. \"Whereas we can get super high-quality coffee from different parts of the world at a price that's much more friendly to the consumer.\"",
      "Gregory's Coffee has not raised prices yet despite the jump in costs. But Leonti said that could change soon.",
      "\"Prices are going to have to go up \u2014 there's no other way around it,\" he said. \"We're seeing tariffs from the places where we get our bags printed as well. So everything around the coffee business is getting tariffs at some point.\"",
      "Like other retailers, Gregory's prices vary depending on where a store is located, reflecting regional labor and other costs. In New York City, the chain charges $3.45 for a regular cup of coffee, while at its New Jersey and Washington, D.C., outlets the same item runs $3.15.",
      "Other retailers are also preparing for increased coffee costs. Mark Smucker, CEO of The J.M. Smucker Co., whose portfolio includes the Folgers Coffee, Caf\u00e9 Bustelo and Dunkin' at-home brands, said during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call in June that prices will likely increase for a third time this year \"due to higher green coffee costs.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Starbucks Chief Financial Officer Catherine R. Smith said during the company's third-quarter earnings call in July that, due to the company's coffee buying and hedging practices, customers shouldn't expect price increases until the first half of fiscal 2026.",
      "At Gregory's Coffee, \"The last thing we want to do is just keep raising prices on our guests,\" Zamfotis said. \"We're hoping that if prices go up a few pennies across the board, that doesn't turn off our everyday customers. We're not doing this to make more money \u2014 we're doing this to protect our business.\"",

    "summary": "With the federal government on the brink of another lapse in funding, here's a look at the 14 shutdowns that have occurred since 1980.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Congress appears to be barreling toward another government shutdown, with President Trump and congressional Republicans at odds with Democrats over the path forward for averting a lapse in federal funding.",
      "Mr. Trump said Sunday that a shutdown is likely, rejecting Democrats' push for Congress to permanently extend enhanced tax credits for Americans enrolled in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, which expire at the end of the year. The president met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at the White House on Monday, but the meeting ended without a breakthrough.",
      "The president canceled an earlier meeting with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders set for last week, calling their demands \"unserious and ridiculous,\" and House Republicans left Washington, D.C., earlier this month after approving a stopgap measure that kept the government funded until Nov. 21. But the proposal failed to garner the necessary support in the Senate. A Democrat-backed counter-plan to extend funding through Oct. 31, which included other party priorities, also failed in the upper chamber.",
      "In an effort to ramp up the pressure on Democrats to go along with Republicans' funding measure, the White House budget office sent a memo to federal agencies last week telling them to consider reduction-in-force plans for mass layoffs of certain federal workers during a shutdown.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",
      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, yearlong spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are expected to feel the impacts of a shutdown if a deal isn't reached this time around.",

      "What happened:\u00a0On Nov. 20, 1981, the Senate approved legislation that fell short of spending cuts Reagan had sought. The bill differed from a version passed in the House and funding technically lapsed at midnight, but since Nov. 21 fell on a Saturday, the effects weren't felt immediately. House and Senate negotiators worked over the weekend to reconcile their differences and passed identical bills on Sunday.",
      "On Monday, Reagan vetoed the plan and ordered the government to shut down, placing 250,000 federal employees on furlough. Later in the day, lawmakers passed a stopgap bill to keep the government funded and allow more time for talks on a deal. Workers returned the next day.",

Democrats kept their cuts to foreign aid and defense.",

The rule was repealed in 1987.",

      "What happened:\u00a0The shutdowns that occurred during Clinton's presidency centered around his dispute with congressional Republicans of their pledge to balance the budget and repeal the president's 1993 tax increases. The GOP, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, took control of the House for the first time in 40 years in 1995 in what would be remembered as the \"Republican Revolution.\"",
      "The GOP-led Congress passed a short-term continuing resolution that sought to boost Medicare premiums and required the president to balance the budget within seven years, among other measures. But Clinton vetoed the legislation, which led to a shutdown.",

      "The issue was which agency's budget projections, the Congressional Budget Office or the Office of Management and Budget, the White House should use to show that the budget was balanced within seven years. In the end, Republicans backed down: then-Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole indicated in a floor speech on New Year's Eve that \"we ought to end this.

      "What happened:\u00a0The fight began over the Affordable Care Act and a push by Republicans to dismantle key parts of Obama's signature health care law. The GOP-led House passed two spending bills, one of which would've delayed implementation of Obamacare, which were both rejected by the Democratic-led Senate.",
      "Obama called for a spending bill with no conditions attached, but Republicans ultimately opted to shut down the government over their opposition to the landmark health care law.",
      "House Republicans led by Speaker John Boehner in the end ceded to Democrats and approved a short-term spending bill that didn't include changes to Obamacare.",

      "Senate control: Republicans",
      "House control: Republicans",
      "What happened:\u00a0The shutdown, which officially began on the one-year anniversary of Trump's inauguration, stemmed from a fight over immigration, and specifically Democrats' demands for protections for \"Dreamers,\" undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children.",
      "The White House, however, said it would not engage in negotiations over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which extended legal protections for Dreamers, while the government was shut down.",
      "In the end, Democrats relented after Republicans pledged to work toward a deal addressing DACA, and Trump signed a short-term funding bill that reopened the government.",

      "Duration: 34 days",
      "White House: Trump",
      "Senate control: Republicans",
      "House control: Republicans/Democrats",
      "What happened:\u00a0Months later, immigration was again at the center of the government funding fight, though this shutdown involved Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to pay for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "As the shutdown stretched to become the longest in history and Democrats took control of the House, the former president ended up signing a bill to reopen agencies for three weeks and did not include money for the border wall. Weeks later, Congress averted another shutdown by passing a measure that included $1.375 billion for the border wall, far less than the $5.7 billion Trump requested.",

      "Thomas Jacob \"Jake\" Sanford, 40, drove his vehicle through the front doors of the church and fired multiple rounds from an assault rifle during Sunday services, authorities said. Sanford also apparently used gas to start a fire at the church, officials said. Grand Blanc police chief William Renye  said officers were on the scene within 30 seconds after a 911 call and fatally shot Sanford, who killed four people and injured eight more.",
      "Sanford served in the U.S. Marines from 2004 to 2008, CBS News confirmed. He was an Iraq war veteran who deployed for several months during 2007 and 2008, according to service records provided by the Pentagon.",
      "White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said on Fox Monday morning that FBI Director Kash Patel told her Sanford \"hated people of the Mormon faith.\"",
      "\"From what I understand based on my conversations with the FBI director, all they know right now is this was an individual who hated people of the Mormon faith, and they are trying to understand more about this, how premeditated it was, how much planning went into it, whether he left a note,\" Leavitt said.",
      "Kris Johns, who is running for city council in Burton, Michigan, which is near where the shooting happened in Grand Blanc Township, told CBS News he met Sanford at his home last week while campaigning. He said Sanford had a particular dislike of the Latter-day Saints church. He said Sanford told him that the church's followers \"believe they're above Jesus.\"",

      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies would be expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even if lawmakers fail this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",

      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",

      "Hurricane Humberto, the eighth named storm to emerge this hurricane season, is currently swirling over waters north of the Caribbean. While forecasts predict Humberto won't ever touch land, there is a possibility it could interact with another system,\u00a0Imelda, which has developed nearby in the western Atlantic.",
      "That's an unlikely outcome, said CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan. But if such a collision does occur, it could produce what's called\u00a0the Fujiwhara effect, a rare phenomenon in which two different storms merge and become entangled around a newly formed, common center.",
      "How the process plays out depends on the characteristics of the storms involved, according to the National Weather Service. The forecasting agency describes the Fujiwhara effect on its website as \"an intense dance\" between two tropical storms that can happen when they get close enough to each other on their respective tracks to reach a common point and either join together or spin around each other for a period of time before continuing along their individual paths.",
      "In the latter scenario, the storms involved must be comparably strong or large.",
      "\"Typically when one system is stronger than the other, the smaller and weaker system will get overrun by the larger, stronger one and completely eliminate it,\" Nolan said.",
      "Similar systems \"will dance around each other\" before going their separate ways, she continued, adding: \"Very rarely has a larger system absorbed a smaller one and become larger or stronger, but it is scientifically possible.\"",
      "\"With the two tropical troubles currently north of the Caribbean, these two may interact under the Fujiwhara effect in the days ahead,\" said Nolan. However, because the developing system \"appears to be much weaker than Humberto and several miles away from it,\" an interaction between the two \u2014 if one even takes place at all \u2014 may not result in a tangled gravitational \"dance.\"",
      "Humberto grew into a tropical storm Wednesday night while traveling over open waters in the central tropical Atlantic. It gained hurricane status early Friday morning and strengthened into a Category 5 on Saturday before weakening again.",
      "It was forecast to pass west of Bermuda and remain a hurricane for more several days, the hurricane center said.",
      "The second system churning nearby strengthened on Sunday into Tropical Storm Imelda and then was upgraded to a hurricane on Tuesday. Imelda threatened to bring hurricane conditions to Bermuda by Wednesday evening.",
      "Officials along the southeast U.S. coast from Florida to the Carolinas were watching Imelda closely, but its path skirted a direct hit on the mainland.",

      "Hamas and other Palestinian factions are leaning toward accepting President Trump's plan to end the war in Gaza, and they will present the group's response to Egyptian and Qatari mediators on Wednesday, a source close to the process told CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "The plan, which Mr. Trump presented alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Monday, is a 20-point proposal which, if agreed to, would see a swift ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all the remaining hostages and a number of Palestinian prisoners in Israel, an increased flow of humanitarian aid and the eventual transfer of control over the territory to an interim administration of Palestinian technocrats overseen by an international \"Board of Peace\" chaired by Mr. Trump.",
      "It says that \"within 72 hours of Israel publicly accepting this agreement, all hostages, alive and deceased, will be returned.\" Netanyahu appeared to publicly accept the agreement alongside Mr. Trump on Monday.",
      "Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair would also be on the \"Board of Peace,\" and, according to the plan, Israel would maintain security control around the perimeter of Gaza.\u00a0Speaking Monday after his appearance with Mr. Trump, Netanyahu indicated that Israeli forces would remain \"in most parts of the Strip\" at least until all of the hostages were returned.",
      "A diplomatic source with knowledge of the talks told CBS News that an Egyptian official and the Qatari prime minister had provided Hamas representatives with a copy of the proposal.",
      "The Palestinian Authority, which partially administers areas of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, issued a statement supporting the plan, which was published by the PA-linked WAFA news agency.",
      "In its statement, the PA stressed \"the importance of the partnership with the United States in achieving peace in the region,\" and reaffirmed its commitments to certain reforms, including \"holding Presidential and Parliamentary elections within one year after the end of the war.\"",
      "\"We have affirmed that we desire a modern, democratic, non-militarized Palestinian state that is committed to pluralism and the peaceful transfer of power,\" the statement said.",
      "Mr. Trump's proposal does not include any immediate role for the PA in administering post-war Gaza, but it says the organization could eventually \"securely and effectively take back control of Gaza\" once it has implemented a series of reforms.",
      "The leaders of a number of Muslim majority nations, including key states in the Middle East, quickly signalled support for the plan. Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar issued a joint statement welcoming Mr. Trump's \"sincere efforts to end the war in Gaza\" and asserting their \"confidence in his ability to find a path to peace.\"",
      "\"They emphasize the importance of the partnership with the United States in securing peace in the region. Along these lines, the ministers welcome the announcement by President Trump regarding his proposal to end the war, rebuild Gaza, prevent the displacement of the Palestinian people and advance a comprehensive peace, as well as his announcement that he will not allow the annexation of the West Bank,\" the joint statement said.",
      "The president of the European Council, Antonio Costa, said he was \"encouraged by Prime Minister Netanyahu's positive response\" to the U.S. proposal, and that \"all parties must seize this moment to give peace a genuine chance,\" CBS News partner network BBC News reported.",
      "The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk, told CBS News that \"anything that brings us to a ceasefire, to the release of hostages, to an end to the carnage that we see, and an end to the incredible suffering, and a pathway for peace is welcome.\"",
      "\"Anyone can govern Gaza, but we don't want another war like the one from the 7th of October. And the second thing: We don't want the Israeli army to enter our homes like what happened in 1948,\" one man in the Gazan city of Deir al Balah said. He told CBS News he had been displaced 14 times during the war. \"Trump's proposal doesn't matter. Trump is Israel. The U.S. is with Israel. Israel is America. The Arab states all conspired against us, and America is Israel.\"",
      "\"Anything that ends the bloodshed and the fighting is good. Anything that will end the slaughter that we are going through,\" another man in Deir al Balah told CBS News.",
      "Asked whether he'd be satisfied if a peace deal came at the cost of postponing any plans for the creation of an independent Palestinian state, he said: \"Everything, all of that will be solved afterwards, after our situation is stabilized, and that can all be solved later on. We are very optimistic in God.\"",

      "Canadian authorities have identified a person known as \"The Woman in the Well\" nearly two decades after her remains were found.",
      "The woman, Alice Spence, was born in September 1881 and had moved to Canada from Minnesota in 1913, police said.",
      "In June 2006, crews excavating a site in Sutherland, Saskatoon, found an old well and a barrel containing preserved human remains, according to a news release from the Saskatoon Police Service. The area was previously the site of the Shore Hotel, a boarding house that was demolished in 1927, according to a news release from the private genetic genealogy company Othram.",
      "The woman had been partially dismembered, police believed, and was wrapped in a burlap sack and stuffed in the barrel, Othram said. Police found clothes, including a fitted jacket and long skirt, that dated to between 1910 and 1920, Othram said. A broken necklace and men's clothing were also found.",
      "An autopsy determined the woman had died under suspicious circumstances, but authorities were unable to identify her despite years of investigation. Police developed a DNA profile, but found no matches, and facial reconstruction images released to the public turned up no answers, Othram said.",
      "In 2023, the Saskatoon Police Services submitted forensic evidence from the case to Othram. Othram's scientists were able to develop a DNA extract from the skeletal evidence. They built a comprehensive DNA profile, Othram said, which was used to generate \"new investigative leads\" that were returned to the police service.",
      "A breakthrough came in June this year, Saskatoon Police Service Sergeant Darren Funk said in a news conference. At an event in Ottawa, Funk heard the Toronto Police Service describe how they had used investigative genetic genealogy to solve a homicide. Investigative genetic genealogy uses the DNA of people who were related to the subject to help make an identification.",
      "Funk connected with the Toronto Police Service and asked them to review the case of \"The Woman in the Well.\" The Toronto Police Service's follow-up investigation led investigators to people who may have been the woman's relatives. Police collected reference DNA samples from those subjects, and those samples were compared to the woman's DNA profile. Authorities also used historical information and city archives to help make the identification.",
      "Alice Spence was married to a man named Charles Spence and had a daughter, Idella, police said. Spence's listing in a 1916 census was the last proof of life historians could find for her.",
      "The family's home in Sutherland was destroyed by a fire in 1918, police said. Other records show Charles and Idella Spence living with a housekeeper in 1921. Investigators believe that Alice's death occurred sometime between 1916 and the fire in 1918.",
      "Spence's descendants, located through forensic genetic genealogy, were largely unaware of their relative and her death, police said.",
      "The police service said it believes this is the oldest investigation in Canada to be solved with the assistance of investigative genetic genealogy.

    "summary": "President Trump floated a framework to end the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accepted \u2014 though it's unclear how Hamas will respond.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump offered up a 20-point plan Monday that he cast as a roadmap to end the Israel-Hamas war, a proposal that was backed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2014 though it remains unclear how Hamas will respond.",
      "The plan \u2014 which was presented as Netanyahu visited the White House \u2014 calls for Hamas to return all Israeli hostages within 72 hours, and for Israel's military to begin withdrawing from parts of the Gaza Strip in phases. It proposes handing over parts of Gaza to a \"technocratic\" committee and deploying a temporary security force backed by Arab states.",
      "Mr. Trump said in a joint press conference with Netanyahu that his goal is to ensure a \"sustainable, long-term peace.\"",
      "Israel and Hamas have been at war since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led terrorists attacked southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. Since then, Israel has waged an intense aerial bombardment and ground campaign in the Gaza Strip. More than 60,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not specify how many of the dead were civilians or militants.",
      "Netanyahu said Monday he supports the plan, which \"achieves our war aims.\" He said if Hamas does not accept the offer, \"Israel will finish the job by itself.\"",
      "Hamas has not yet responded to the proposal. Qatar's prime minister and Egypt's intelligence chief met with negotiators from Hamas, who said they would review the proposal \"in good faith\" and provide a response, a White House official told CBS News.",
      "Some unanswered questions about the plan still linger, including the exact timing of possible Israeli withdrawals from Gaza and the involvement of different international partners.",
      "Israel and Hamas would stop fighting, trade hostages and prisoners",
      "The plan calls for an immediate end to fighting if both Israel and Hamas agree to the plan, with Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip immediately withdrawing to an \"agreed upon line.\"",
      "\"During this time, all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended, and battle lines will remain frozen until conditions are met for the complete staged withdrawal,\" the plan states.",
      "Within 72 hours of Israel accepting the deal, which Netanyahu appeared to do Monday, Hamas is expected to free all remaining hostages. Some 50 hostages are still in Gaza, fewer than half of whom are believed to be alive, according to Israeli authorities.",
      "In exchange, Israel is expected to release 250 Palestinians serving life sentences, as well as 1,700 other Gazans who were detained following the start of the current conflict. The plan calls for the remains of 15 deceased Gazans to be returned for every one deceased hostage. The Israeli releases would take place after the hostages are released by Hamas.",
      "The plan calls for Gaza to be demilitarized \"under the supervision of independent monitors,\" with any weapons factories and tunnels destroyed and weapons decommissioned.",
      "\"A guarantee will be provided by regional partners to ensure that Hamas, and the factions, comply with their obligations and that New Gaza poses no threat to its neighbors or its people,\" one of the 20 points states.",
      "Aid and economic development would enter Gaza",
      "The plan states \"full aid will be immediately sent\" to Gaza, which has faced severe food shortages and has fallen into famine in some regions, according to the world's leading authority on food crises.",
      "It calls for aid deliveries that are at least equal to the levels agreed upon during a prior two-month ceasefire that began in January, with supplies flowing through the Rafah border crossing in southern Gaza. It also states the plan would involve \"rehabilitation of hospitals and bakeries.\"",
      "It states aid would be distributed by \"international institutions not associated in any manner with either party,\" including the United Nations and the Red Crescent. The plan does not mention the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a controversial U.S.- and Israeli-backed group that has handled many aid deliveries in the territory in recent months, whose members have been repeatedly accused of firing at Palestinians trying to get aid.",
      "The proposal also floats convening a \"panel of experts\" that could draw up economic redevelopment plans for the Gaza Strip. It states Gaza would exist in a \"special economic zone\" with \"preferred tariff and access rates.\"",
      "Gaza to be led by \"technocratic\" group and stabilization force, not Hamas",
      "After Israel withdraws from parts of Gaza, the plan calls for the territory to be governed by neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority, which currently oversees much of the West Bank.",
      "Instead, the enclave would be governed by a \"technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee, responsible for delivering the day-to-day running of public services and municipalities for the people in Gaza.\" It's not clear who would participate in that committee, but the plan states it would be composed of \"qualified Palestinians and international experts.\"",
      "Overseeing this new governing structure would be a \"Board of Peace\" chaired by Mr. Trump.",
      "In a press conference Monday, the president said he's slated to lead the board \"not at my request, believe me. I'm very busy. But we have to make sure this works.\"",
      "The plan also envisions an \"International Stabilization Force\" that would temporarily oversee security in Gaza. This group would be backed by the U.S. and Arab states, and tasked with training \"vetted Palestinian Police forces\" in collaboration with Jordan and Egypt.",
      "It states Hamas would need to \"agree to not have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly, indirectly, or in any form.\" But Hamas members would get amnesty if they \"commit to peaceful co-existence and to decommission their weapons,\" and members of the group who want to leave the territory would be able to do so.",
      "The plan would also \u2014 at least temporarily \u2014 sideline the Palestinian Authority, which has played a key part in security and governance in the occupied Palestinian territories since the 1990s. The authority is dominated by Fatah, a political movement that has long been at odds with Hamas, and it has not governed Gaza since Hamas took over the strip in 2007.",
      "Netanyahu has long criticized the Palestinian Authority. He said Monday the group would have \"no role whatsoever in Gaza without undergoing a radical and genuine transformation,\" including changes to its education system and an end to a long-controversial stipend system for the families of Palestinian militants.",
      "The West Bank \u2014 which Israel has occupied since 1967 \u2014 is home to millions of Palestinians and hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers. Since the 1990s, the territory has been split up between areas where the Palestinian Authority has some degree of control and areas fully governed by the Israeli military. The Gaza Strip was also occupied in 1967, though Israel withdrew from the territory and removed its settlements in 2005. The territory has been under a tight Israeli and Egyptian blockade since Hamas' 2007 takeover.",
      "Israel would withdraw from Gaza and won't annex territory",
      "The Israel Defense Forces would immediately withdraw from part of Gaza after a deal is reached. It would continue to withdraw from parts of the territory and hand over control to the new International Stabilization Force \"based on standards, milestones, and timeframes linked to demilitarization.\"",
      "Israeli forces would remain present in a \"security perimeter,\" however, until Gaza \"is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat,\" the plan states. Netanyahu said Monday the IDF would remain in that perimeter \"for the foreseeable future.\"",
      "If Hamas doesn't accept the proposal, it calls for the plan to \"proceed in the terror-free areas\" that are handed over from the Israeli military to the new stabilization force.",
      "Plan calls statehood an \"aspiration of the Palestinian people\"",
      "The proposal does not lay out a clear roadmap for an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. But it says that, if the plan works out, \"the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognize as the aspiration of the Palestinian people.\"",
      "Netanyahu has ruled out allowing a Palestinian state to be formed, and has castigated U.S. allies like the United Kingdom and France for recognizing a Palestinian state last week at the United Nations General Assembly, calling it an \"absurd prize for terrorism.\" Mr. Trump has also opposed calls for a Palestinian state. But key Arab partners have backed Palestinian statehood and cast it as a necessary component of any long-term resolution.",
      "The plan also pushes for an \"interfaith dialogue process\" to \"try and change mindsets and narratives of Palestinians and Israelis,\" and a \"dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous co-existence.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 29 Sep 2025 11:46:58 -0400",
    "summary": "Eli Sharabi, who was taken hostage by Hamas terrorists on October 7, 2023, before being released last February, explains why he remains optimistic for the future.",
    "story": [
      "\"You know, 50 meters underground, you actually understand the meaning in life,\" said Eli Sharabi. For 491 days, Sharabi was a Hamas hostage. \"That it's not your academic degrees and not your profession,\" he said. \"You miss your family and friends, and just wish for another minute with them.\"",
      "Held captive deep in tunnels under Gaza, Sharabi always imagined returning to his home in the Israeli Kibbutz Be'eri. \"Sunday Morning\" was with him earlier this month when he returned for the first time since his release. Time has seemingly stopped in this community just three miles from Gaza. Two years on, the shrubbery has grown up around his house. But there's no concealing the pain here.",
      "\"Wow,\" Sharabi said, getting emotional. \"I remember they grabbed me from here.\"",
      "His wife, Lianne, and their daughters, 16-year-old Noiya and 13-year-old Yahel, were still inside, as Hamas terrorists overran their kibbutz, killing 101 of its residents.",
      "He said, \"This place used to help so much to Palestinian civilians \u2013 send them money and take some of them from the border to hospitals in Israel.\" Those memories are hard to reconcile with his last moments here.",
      "He says he knew he was being kidnapped: \"I understood Arabic. My last second in the house, I just turned my head and like that to my daughters and said, 'I'll come back.'\"",
      "It's a nightmare he details in his book \"Hostage,\" a gripping account of his ordeal, in which he wrote on page one, \"Five terrorists enter with weapons drawn. We are in our pajamas; they come with uniforms, balaclavas, and Kalashnikovs. They found us.\"",
      "\"I will never forget the fears in my daughter's eyes,\" he said. \"It was horrible.\"",
      "In that horrible chaos of the day when 250 others were taken hostage, Sharabi was ultimately brought into a home and tied up.",
      "\"After 52 days, they moved us to the tunnels,\" he said. \"The first mosque we've seen, we got in, they opened the door on the floor, and we've seen the ladder and they asked us to climb down, something like 30 meters. It looked like the perfect grave.\"",
      "In the tunnels under Gaza, Sharabi was held with various hostages, including American Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who was later murdered by Hamas at age 24. Golberg-Polin often repeated a quote which stuck with Sharabi: \"He who has a why to live, can bear any how.\"",
      "\"You're looking for any source that give you hope, that give you strength,\" Sharabi said.",
      "His captors told him his wife and daughters were alive, seen at protests campaigning for his release. It was the \"why\" he needed to cope with that torture in the tunnels.",
      "\"They beat us,\" Sharabi said. \"One time they broke my ribs and I couldn't breathe properly for two or three months, and my friend needed to help me to stand to go to the bathroom. They undressed us every two weeks and look for things that maybe we are going to attack them with them.\"",
      "What did that experience do to him? \"It's very humiliating moments for you,\" he said, \"and especially when you are chained to your friends, leg by leg, and you need to go to the bathroom with him \u2026 you have to go together. It's very, very humiliating moment. There's no running water, so you use bottles. You can see the worms everywhere. Worms, rats, cockroaches.\"",
      "When we were in Kibbutz Be'eri in mid-September, explosions could be heard as Israel stepped up its ground offensive in Gaza. \"It's not nice, these explosions,\" Sharabi said. \"Especially when you think it's another 48 hostages remain there. Two years. It's awful for both sides.\"",
      "I asked, \"There are going to be people who watch this and say, 'You're giving this space to this man to share his story. What about the 60,000-plus people in Gaza who've been killed?'\"",
      "\"First of all, they need to remember who started October 7,\" Sharabi replied. \"If someone can explain to me how you fighting against a terror organization that hiding behind his own population without people to get hurt, innocent people, I don't know how to do it.\"",
      "He worries especially about another captive he left behind: 24-year-old Alon Ohel. Sharabi became a father figure to him in their year-plus together, and when Sharabi found out he was going to be freed, Ohel was not on the list. \"You imagine this moment hundreds of times,\" Sharabi said. \"And you believe it's going to be the happiest moment ever. And because of Alon, this moment become very complicated. He had small panic attack. He started to cry and shaking. So, we took water, washed his face, hugging him. It wasn't easy.\"",
      "He says his mission now is to bring all of the hostages home. Sharabi has been fighting to get the remaining living hostages out, along with the bodies of those, like his brother, Yossi, who were killed in captivity.",
      "Sharabi's emotions are often close to the surface, but kept in check, even describing the unimaginable: being shackled. \"We were chained with iron chains on our legs, 24/7,\" he said. \"Every step you make, it's not more than three inches. It was a week before the release when they took it off, and our legs start to fly all over the place. We couldn't control them because we didn't know how to walk.\"",
      "When he was released, he'd lost 66 pounds. The handover was terrifying, he says, but he could endure anything just to hug his wife and daughters again. Then, he heard this from the social worker greeting him in Israel: Your mother and your sister waiting for you.",
      "Sharabi said when he heard that he said, \"'Well, just bring me Lianne and my daughters.' And she said, 'Well, your mother and your sister will tell you.'\"",
      "Lianne, Noiya and Yahel were among the 1,200 people killed on October 7, 2023.",
      "Next to their graves is a place for his brother, Yossi.",
      "Today, Sharabi said, \"I choose life. I need to be strong for them. I don't have the privilege to break. I'm really grateful for my second chance.\"",
      "He says he thinks of his wife and daughters and the life they missed. \"But I'm very positive the life I'm going to rebuild,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"How can you be so positive after losing so much?\"",
      "\"I love life. I love life,\" he replied. \"I'm very proud that I'm that meaningful for other people. It's the most moving feeling that you can feel, that people care about you. People say for me, 'We lose simple things, and we think our world is finished. And you lost your brother, your wife, and your daughters, and you're smiling today. How's that possible?'\"",
      "And his response? \"I can't do anything, anything that bring back Lianne, Noyia, Yahel, Yossi. And so, the best thing I can do for their memories is to be optimistic and to be strong and to rebuild my life.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Iranian authorities said Monday they had hanged a man they accused of spying for Israel, the latest in what is believed to be the largest wave of executions by Tehran in decades, according to activists monitoring human rights issues and the use of the death penalty in the Islamic Republic.",
      "Iran\u00a0identified the executed man as Bahman Choobiasl. His case hadn't previously been reported in Iranian state media to activists monitoring human rights issues and the use of the death penalty in the Islamic Republic.",
      "Iranian state media outlet\u00a0Mizan\u00a0reported Monday that Choobiasl \"had engaged in extensive and deliberate cooperation with the Israeli intelligence service in the field of databases.\" CBS News has reached out to Iranian authorities for comment.",
      "The execution came as Iran vowed to confront what it called its enemies after the United Nations reimposed sanctions on Tehran over its nuclear program this weekend. The European Union followed suit Monday, imposing similar sanctions on Iran.",
      "Iran accused Choobiasl of meeting with operatives from the Israeli spy agency Mossad, calling him the agency's \"most trusted\" spy. Iran's Mizan news agency, which is the judiciary's official mouthpiece, said Choobiasl worked on \"sensitive telecommunications projects\" and reported about the \"paths of importing electronic devices.\"",
      "Iran is known to have hanged nine people for espionage since its June war with Israel. Israel carried out 12 days of air strikes on Iran in June, killing at least 1,100 people according to Amnesty International.",
      "Earlier this month, the Iranian government executed Babak Shahbazi, according to Amnesty International's Iran chapter, which said in a\u00a0post on social media that Shahbazi's execution was \"arbitrary\" and \"horrific.\" Tehran had alleged that Shahbazi spied for Israel but human rights activists have disputed that, saying he was tortured into a false confession after he wrote a letter to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy offering to fight for Kyiv. Iran has taken Russia's side in that conflict, giving its military critical support, including armed drones.",
      "The Islamic Republic routinely conducts closed-door trials of people accused of espionage and other crimes, with defendants often prevented from seeing or disputing the evidence against them.",
      "Iran has faced multiple nationwide protests in recent years, fueled by anger over the economy, demands for women's rights and calls for the country's theocracy to change.",
      "The Oslo-based group Iran Human Rights and the Washington-based Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran put the number of people executed in 2025 at over 1,000, noting the number could be higher as the government does not report on each execution.",
      "United Nations human rights experts also criticized Iran's executions on Monday",
      "\"The sheer scale of executions in Iran is staggering and represents a grave violation of the right to life,\" U.N. experts from the Office of the High Commissioner said in a statement\u00a0Monday. \"With an average of more than nine hangings per day in recent weeks, Iran appears to be conducting executions at an industrial scale that defies all accepted standards of human rights protection.\"",
      "The United Nations reimposed sanctions on Iran\u00a0early Sunday on the grounds that it was violating its 2015 agreement to limit its nuclear program, further squeezing the Islamic Republic as growing numbers of Iranians struggle to afford basic needs.",
      "The sanctions will again freeze Iranian assets abroad, halt arms deals with Tehran, and penalize any development of Iran's ballistic missile program, among other measures. It came via a mechanism known as \"snapback,\" included in Iran's 2015 nuclear deal\u00a0with world powers, and comes as the country's economy already is reeling.",

It's something the president's going to make the final determination on,\" Vance said on \"Fox News Sunday.\"",

I think that gets them really invested in both what's happening in their own backyard, but also in the peace process that the president has been pushing for, for the last eight months,\" Vance said.",
      "The U.S.-made Tomahawk missile has a range of about 1,500 miles, which would place Moscow well within the range of Kyiv should the Ukrainian government obtain them.",
      "On Monday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov implied that the U.S. was directly interfering in the war between Russian and Ukraine. \"Moscow has heard Washington's statements about possible Tomahawk deliveries to Ukraine and is carefully analyzing them,\" Peskov said at a news conference. \"It is important to understand who will be directing and launching the Tomahawk missiles from Ukrainian territory \u2014 the Americans or the Ukrainians themselves.\"",

The attacks killed four people and wounded dozens more, Ukrainian officials said, and was one of the largest aerial barrages Ukraine has faced since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country in 2022.",
      "Mr. Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with Russia's failure to come to the table to negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine, and he has offered Ukraine encouragement over the past week in its fight to repel Russian troops.",
      "\"Russia has been fighting aimlessly for three and a half years a War that should have taken a Real Military Power less than a week to win. This is not distinguishing Russia. In fact, it is very much making them look like 'a paper tiger,'\" Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post Tuesday.",

The Russia-friendly Alternativa Bloc came third, followed by the populist Our Party. The right-wing Democracy at Home party also won enough votes to enter parliament.",
      "The tense balloting Sunday pitted the governing PAS against several Russia-friendly opponents but no viable pro-European partners. Electoral data indicate the party will hold a clear majority of about 55 of the 101 seats in the legislature.",
      "It is likely that President Maia Sandu, who founded the PAS in 2016, will opt for some continuity by nominating pro-Western Prime Minister Dorin Recean, an economist who has steered Moldova's government through multiple crises since 2023, to stay on as prime minister. Recean has also previously served as Sandu's defense and security adviser.",
      "The election was widely viewed as a geopolitical choice for Moldovans between a path to the European Union or a drift back into Moscow's fold. The outcome of Sunday's high-stakes voting was noteworthy considering Moldovan authorities' repeated claims that Russia was conducting a vast\u00a0\"hybrid war\"\u00a0to try to sway the outcome.",

      "Speaking via videolink to a security conference in Poland Monday, Ukrainian President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia had failed to \"destabilize\" Moldova, even \"after spending huge, huge resources to undermine it and to corrupt whoever they could.\"",
      "On Friday, Moldova's President Sandu had said it was the country's \"most consequential election.\"",
      "\"Its outcome will decide whether we consolidate our democracy and join the EU, or whether Russia drags us back into a grey zone, making us a regional risk,\" Sandu said in a\u00a0post on X.",

      "\"A PAS majority saves the party from having to form a coalition that would have most likely been unstable and would have slowed down the pace of reforms to join the EU,\" he said, adding that \"Moldova will continue to be in a difficult geopolitical environment characterized by Russia's attempts to pull it back into its sphere of influence.\"",
      "In an interview with the AP days before the vote, PAS leader Igor Grosu also warned of Russian interference and said Sunday's results would define the country's future \"not just for the next four years, but for many, many years ahead.\"",
      "\"But I believe in the determination and mobilization spirit of Moldovans, at home and in the diaspora,\" he said.",

      "This is the first major bombardment since an air attack on Kyiv left at least 21 people dead last month.",
      "The attack comes as the United Nations General Assembly concluded in New York and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asked for help from world leaders. \"Don't stay silent while Russia keeps dragging this war on,\" he said.",
      "President Trump said that NATO countries should shoot down Russian drones that violate their airspace. Mr. Trump said Zelenskyy was \"putting up one hell of a fight.\"",
      "Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, meanwhile, told leaders on Saturday that while his country doesn't have any plans to attack Europe, any aggression against his country would be met with an \"aggressive response.\"",

      "\"Ukraine needs to have the ability to use long range weapons to push Russia back,\" Turner said. \"And when they're able to do that, they will get their territory back. If they are able to do that, they will win this war.\"",
      "Kyiv bears the brunt of the attack",
      "Tymur Tkachenko, head of the Kyiv City Administration, confirmed Sunday's casualties via Telegram and said 10 others were wounded in the attack that targeted civilian areas across the city. A 12-year-old girl was among the dead. Thick black smoke could be seen rising from a blast near the city center.",
      "\"The Russians have restarted the child death counter,\" Tkachenko wrote on Telegram.",
      "Russia fired a total of 595 exploding drones and decoys and 48 missiles, Ukraine's air force said Sunday. Of those, air defenses shot down or jammed 566 drones and 45 missiles.",
      "Besides Kyiv, Zelenskyy said the bombardment targeted the regions of Zaporizhzhia, Khmelnytskyi, Sumy, Mykolaiv, Chernihiv, and Odesa.

Later, Ukraine's Interior Ministry stated the number of the wounded rose to 70, with over a hundred civilian objects damaged.",
      "Zaporizhzhia's regional head, Ivan Fedorov, said three children were among the 27 wounded in the region, adding that over two dozen buildings were damaged in the capital that bears the same name.",
      "\"This vile attack came virtually (at) the close of UN General Assembly week, and this is exactly how Russia declares its true position. Moscow wants to keep fighting and killing, and it deserves the toughest pressure from the world,\" Zelenskyy wrote.",
      "Residents shaken",
      "The strikes that began overnight and continued after dawn on Sunday also targeted residential buildings, civilian infrastructure, a medical facility and a kindergarten, according to Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko, who also said damage was reported at more than 20 locations across the capital.",
      "At Kyiv's central train station, passengers arrived to the crackle of anti-aircraft gunfire and the low buzz of attack drones. Mostly women, they waited quietly in a platform underpass until the air raid alert ended. Parents checked the news on their phones while children played online games.",
      "\"The sky has turned black again,\" said one woman at the station, who gave only her first name, Erika. \"It's happening a lot.\"",
      "Ilona Kovalenko, a 38-year-old resident of a five-story building struck in Kyiv's Solomianskyi district, told The Associated Press she woke up because of the explosion, which shattered windows.",

      "Oleksandra, the neighbor's daughter, was the 12-year-old killed in the attack.",
      "\"Sadly, she died on the spot,\" Kovalenko said. \"We are in shock, to be honest.\"",
      "Another multi-story residential building was heavily damaged by the attack. Emergency services personnel used power saws to clear the debris. Piles of glass littered nearby sidewalks as building residents, some looking shaken, sat on benches.",
      "Russian officials did not immediately comment on the attacks.",
      "Polish military responses triggered",
      "The assault also triggered military responses in neighboring Poland, where fighter jets were deployed early Sunday morning as Russia struck targets in western Ukraine, according to the Polish armed forces.",
      "Polish military officials characterized these defensive measures as \"preventative.\"",
      "International concerns have mounted recently that the fighting could spread beyond Ukraine's borders as European countries rebuked Russia for what they said were provocations. The incidents have included Russian drones landing on Polish soil and Russian fighter aircraft entering Estonian airspace.",
      "Russia denied its planes entered Estonian airspace and said none of its drones targeted Poland.",
      "The latest bombardment follows Zelenskyy's announcement Saturday of what he called a \"mega deal\" for weapons purchases from the United States. The $90 billion package includes both the major arms agreement and a separate \"drone deal\" for Ukrainian-made drones that the U.S. will purchase directly.",
      "Meanwhile, Russia's Defense Ministry said its air defenses shot down 41 Ukrainian drones overnight into Sunday."

Before Amiri, it had helped secure the release of four other American citizens from Afghanistan earlier this year.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 28, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, who joins us this morning from Richmond. Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have what, 140,000 federal civilian workers in your state, one of the highest numbers in the nation. How concerned are you that you will see mass layoffs if we go into the shutdown that the White House says they are preparing for?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: Well, and I think your reporter Robert Costa said they're even welcoming it. We are really worried about it, Margaret. When Ted Cruz forced a shutdown of the government in October 2013, it hurt Virginia pretty bad. And when Donald Trump forced a shutdown of the government in late 2018, early 2019 it hurt Virginia pretty bad. And this one would be the same. The only thing about the President's threat to fire more people is he's already doing it, and instead of threatening, he should just be meeting to negotiate. We came near shut down deadlines during the Biden administration, but we never shut government down because the President would sit down with congressional leaders of both parties and would find a path forward. And that's what we've been asking for since the Democrats put an alternate plan on the table on September 18, just sit down and talk with us, and finally, he has agreed to do that tomorrow. But if you're reporting, is to be believed, he's sort of going into it, setting reducing expectations improperly. He should be doing what presidents do and saying, we're going to find a deal to keep the government of the greatest nation on earth open.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it enough of a deal to say, take the short term, seven week funding deal, and we'll continue to talk about these health care subsidies that Democrats say they are so concerned about. I mean, is it really worth the risk?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: Here's, here's my thought about this, Margaret. And this is my personal view. We've got to solve this health care issue. And Republicans are saying the same thing. Mike Johnson has said it. Senator Cornyn has said it, Senator Hawley has said it. Senator Murkowski has said it. We're asking to fix a problem that even Republicans want to fix. I don't think we have to have every detail pinned down with all the Is dotted and Ts crossed in order to do a short term extension, but I do want to see that Republicans are saying, You're right. We can fix this, and here's the path to finding a fix. And the second thing we need, which is so reasonable, we're just asking, if we do a deal, please don't, Mr. President, sign the deal, and then immediately the next day start, starting to take away funds, rescinding agreements that you just made yesterday. A deal should be a deal, and we should all agree that Americans should not see their health care suffer, their premiums spike, and people lose insurance and providers close. We've already had providers in Virginia announce that they are closing their doors because of the bill that the Republicans passed in July, and this is happening all over the country. Let's just do what's right by our constituents and fix it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you another question specific to Virginia, and that is, what is going on inside the judicial system. Back in August, it was the US Attorney for the Western District of Virginia, Todd Gilbert, who suddenly resigned. Then earlier this month, the US Attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, Eric Siebert resigned after failing to bring a case against New York's Attorney General, Letitia James. What is going on here in the Virginia court system? Margaret?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: It's pretty darn plain the President nominated two U.S. attorneys in Virginia, both with Republican bona fides. Todd Gilbert in the Western District, had been the Republican Speaker of our house of delegates. He resigned as a legislator to take the Trump appointment. President Trump's team interviewed these candidates, approved the candidates, nominated the candidates, and then even appointed them into the interim position. But both were forced out because they said their integrity as prosecutors would not allow them to genuflect to Donald Trump. And in Todd Gilbert's case, they wanted to force him to demote a long time career member of the Western District of Virginia who had served under multiple administrations and presidents. He refused to do so. And in Eric Siebert's case, he refused to bring a criminal charge against a perceived Trump political opponent when there was no evidence to support the charge. President Trump is spending time going after enemies, trying to figure out a way to give $20 billion to a friend, the Argentine Government, instead of dealing with the challenges we elected him to confront. Food prices are going up. Building supplies are going up. School supplies are going up. Energy costs are going up, health care costs are going up, and Donald Trump seems to be focused on a retribution campaign. You got to focus, man, this is an important job. It's time to focus.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to those Virginia cases, have you talked to Siebert, have you talked to Gilbert to understand why they felt they had to resign?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: I have talked to each of them after the resignations were done. These were individuals I knew both. I knew Todd Gilbert because of his legislative role, and I knew Eric Siebert very well by reputation. And again, this was the prosecutor Margaret, who, when the Biden administration transitioned to the Trump administration, the Trump administration DOJ put him in the role as an interim even before we recommended him, along with our republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, as you mentioned. So after they had been fired, yes, I did call and say I'd like to understand why you were forced out, and they shared thoughts with me without getting into anything about particular cases or particular communication they'd had with Trump administration officials. But I am convinced, and Virginians are convinced. I traveled around the state this week. People are talking about this. Both of these individuals had a backbone. They wouldn't genuflect to Donald Trump, and they wouldn't bring baseless cases, and we shouldn't see that in any district in this nation. And it's sad that President Trump is more focused on retribution than serving his constituents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that Eastern District did come forward with this, this indictment of former FBI Director James Comey. Yes, it was just a two page indictment, no evidence presented publicly here, but it was convincing enough to 14 of 23 people sitting on a grand jury. Can you really say there's no there there?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: Well, a bare majority, as you know, Margaret, there's 23 people on a grand jury. They need at least 12 votes to get an indictment, and yes, they got their finger over the bar with 14, although the four- the 23 wouldn't agree on one of the charges that the US attorney was pushing. So we will see what this case is about. It is odd that the indictment has so few facts, and I found it very odd. I used to practice in this court, and when the Attorney General put out a press statement after the indictment and said, we will follow the facts in this case. What prosecutors follow the facts before they indict, they don't indict, and then say, well, let's see what the facts are. I think she even revealed that this is a weak case, which everyone in her office was telling her it was a weak case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You in your armed services role. I want to quickly ask you, you have said you are supportive of the creation of a Palestinian state, and we saw at the UN this past week, a large number of members just simply walked out when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke, it was a statement tomorrow he's going to be at the White House ahead of that meeting, President Trump said this:",
      "VO SOT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm not allowing Israel to annex the West Bank. There's been enough. It's time to stop now, okay?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a strong statement. Do you know how the United States should enforce that? How do you force Israel to step back from annexation?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: Well, I was very heartened that the President said that, and you're right. I support what the United States voted for in the UN in 1947 a state of Israel and a state of Palestine. One of those promises has been met. One hasn't, and we need to be on a path for a Palestinian state that's demilitarized, where Hamas plays no role in its governance. And until we find that path forward, we're going to have continued cycles of violence that are bad for Israelis, bad for Palestinians, bad for the region. So I hope the president, who, by all accounts, has a strong relationship with Prime Minister Netanyahu, makes plain that we are, we are against annexation, and this 21 point proposal that the President has on the table, which is pretty similar to the New York dialog being led by the French and the Saudis. They're different efforts, but they're trying to reach the same point, a future state for Israel and Palestine, where both can live in peace, and creating stability in the region instead of the cycles of violence. So I hope the president leans into that at the meeting tomorrow. I was heartened by his comment. It would be a big mistake for the Prime Minister Netanyahu to look at all of these nations that have been allies, saying you need to change course, and for him to just pull his head in the shell and turn inward and continue to isolate Israel, rather than move forward toward peace and more stability in the region.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Kaine, thank you for your insights today. We'll be back in a moment."

      "Petro, who has a history of speaking off the cuff in meandering, ideologically charged speeches, also said on social media that \"I don't care\" about the punishment because he is also a European citizen. That means he does not need a visa to travel to the U.S.",

The White House has offered scant information about how the operations came together or the legal authorities under which they were carried out.",
      "Earlier this year, Petro resisted deportation flights using American military aircraft, leading to a diplomatic crisis as Trump threatened to retaliate with higher tariffs and visa suspensions. The U.S. is Colombia's largest trading partner, and Petro's government relented, saying it would accept the planes.",
      "The U.S. accused Colombia earlier this month of failing to cooperate with anti-narcotics efforts. Although the designation did not include sanctions that would have slashed U.S. assistance to the country, it was a sharp rebuke that frustrated Petro.",

      "\"Unfortunately, Hollywood, and the entire metropolitan Los Angeles area, has been dying a slow death for several years now as far as runaway production goes,\" said Honig. \"The cost of living and doing business in the area has become beyond cost-prohibitive, with other parts of the country and the world offering a lot more for a lot less.\"",

      "\"Why? Because of the decentralization of the creative process over the last 40 years. If you rewind the tape, the reason they called so many of those Clint Eastwood movies \u2018Spaghetti Westerns\u2019 is because it was cheaper to film in Italy--as well as southeastern Spain--than it was in Hollywood, or the Midwest, like most of the iconic John Wayne films, just 10-20 years earlier.\"",

Georgia created a 20% tax credit, with an additional 10% credit on top of that, if producers used the Georgia peach logo in the end credits. Similarly, Texas has committed $1.5 billion in tax credits over the next decade, to producers who choose to film in remote, rural, locations across the state and are willing to utilize Texas residents in the production,\" he said.",
      "Eldridge continued, \"By contrast, California has become increasingly stringent: economically (escalating tax brackets), lack of incentives, and a post-Covid environment and economy that has never rebounded to a sense of normalcy, post-pandemic. At the end of the day, Hollywood producers face the same reality as the rest of America: where can you stretch your dollar the farthest\u2014Bergdorf's or Walmart? At a certain point, the discussion and decision becomes purely economical. California better have 'movie-making hospice' on speed-dial, because the outlook isn't good.\"",

    "story": [
      "Dr. Wendy Troxel, a sleep therapist in Utah, discusses a study that found small bouts of light exercise in the evening can help promote more restful sleep.",
      "Magnesium is an essential mineral that supports many basic bodily functions.",
      "It is important for a healthy heart, nerves, muscles and bones, and also helps to regulate calcium and blood sugar levels. The mineral is also vital for protein production, according to Harvard Health.",
      "And now, a new trend on social media claims that magnesium can also promote better sleep, although experts warn there is limited scientific evidence.",
      "HIDDEN SLEEP DANGER COULD INCREASE RISK OF 172 DISEASES, MAJOR STUDY REVEALS",
      "In particular, TikTokers have posted about the effects of magnesium lotion, oils and sprays to induce sleepiness when used on the bottoms of the feet.",
      "One user (@gandyscraftcorner) posted a video that received nearly 20,000 likes with the caption, \"POV: you start putting magnesium lotion on your feet every night before bed and suddenly your insulin and cortisol levels are balancing out \u2026 Sleep quality is better than ever and restless leg symptoms have disappeared.\"",
      "Some TikTok users claim that putting magnesium lotion on the feet promotes better sleep. (iStock)",
      "Dr. Brendan Camp, M.D., a New York-based dermatologist, raised doubts about the claims in an interview with Fox News Digital.",
      "Camp said more research is necessary to determine whether applying magnesium-containing products on the skin increases magnesium levels, therefore promoting sleep.",
      "ALZHEIMER'S RISK COULD RISE WITH SPECIFIC SLEEP PATTERN, EXPERTS WARN",
      "\"In addition, the skin on the plantar surface of the foot is very thick,\" he noted. \"Much of the product that is applied is probably not absorbed systemically, but rather remains on the skin's surface.\"",
      "In a separate interview with Fox News Digital, Dr. Wendy Troxel, a Utah-based sleep psychologist at the RAND Corporation, commented that it\u2019s \"easy to see why magnesium lotion is tempting.\"",
      "A dermatologist noted that most of a magnesium-based lotion most likely does not get absorbed into the skin. (iStock)",
      "\"Everyone is looking for that magic solution to support better sleep, especially when a product is trending or seems like a natural remedy,\" she said. \"However, current scientific evidence does not support magnesium lotion as a sleep aid.\"",
      "The research on magnesium's impact on sleep, whether taken orally or applied topically, is \"limited and equivocal at best,\" according to Troxel.",
      "DEMENTIA RISK NEARLY DOUBLES AMONG THOSE WITH COMMON SLEEP DISORDER, STUDY FINDS",
      "The sleep expert hypothesized that the benefits of a foot massage as part of a nightly routine may contribute to sleepiness more than the actual lotion.",

      "\"Massage helps activate the body\u2019s relaxation response and can make a real difference when winding down prior to bedtime,\" she said.",
      "Healthy sleep foundations",
      "Prioritizing the \"evidence-based\" foundations of sleep health is more important than following what\u2019s on-trend, according to Troxel.",
      "These foundations include having a consistent bedtime and wake-up time, avoiding technology use at night, and cultivating a cool, dark and quiet sleeping environment.",
      "Tech use before bed can disrupt sleep due to its stimulating and \"often addicting\" content and light exposure, Troxel cautioned.",
      "A sleep expert recommends prioritizing the \"evidence-based\" foundations of sleep health. (iStock)",

      "Studies show that this exercise can help prevent anxious ruminations and make it easier to transition into sleep.",

    "summary": "Personal trainers explain how older adults can exercise safely by avoiding common mistakes like ego lifting, skipping strength training and having inadequate recovery time.",
    "story": [
      "Marfred Suazo, known online as Fonz the Trainer in New York City, speaks about the importance of building muscle for daily functioning and longevity.",
      "Experts agree that exercise is vital to longevity and helps to preserve muscle mass, bone density and joint health as we age. But it\u2019s important to approach workouts in the right way to ensure safe, optimal results.",
      "The general guideline is for healthy adults to get 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity per week, along with at least two days of strength training and activities to improve balance.",
      "However, these recommendations should be modified to meet each individual\u2019s physical abilities and conditions, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "FITNESS EXPERT REVEALS 6 PILLARS OF STRENGTH TRAINING THAT OLDER ADULTS SHOULD MASTER",
      "\"Most adults are not failing in the gym because they are lazy. They are failing because no one ever taught them how to train for the stage of life they are in right now,\" Marfred Suazo, a fitness professional known as Fonz the Trainer in New York City, told Fox News Digital.",
      "The general guideline is for healthy adults to get 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity per week. (iStock)",
      "\"They keep doing the same workouts they did years ago and wonder why their back aches, their knees are sore and their progress has stalled.\"",
      "Fox News Digital spoke with fitness experts to identify some of the most common mistakes older adults make when working out and how to avoid them.",
      "\"Most people focus only on the chest, arms, quads and abs, because that is what they see in the mirror,\" Suazo said. \"But ignoring your back, glutes, hamstrings and core creates poor posture, weak links and, eventually, pain.\"",
      "OLDER ADULTS SHOULD TARGET THESE MUSCLES WHEN STRENGTH-TRAINING, SAYS FITNESS PRO",
      "To counteract this, Suazo recommends training the muscles you cannot see, a strategy he calls \"non-mirror training.\"",
      "\"Add rows, Romanian dead lifts, hip bridges, Paloff presses and farmer\u2019s carries to your routine,\" he advised. \"This type of training builds strength that shows up in your posture, balance and the way you move every day.\"",
      "Orrie Markfeld, a personal trainer at Life Time Garden City in New York, said a common mistake he sees is older adults trying to work out with the same intensity and volume as when they were younger, which often leads to overuse injuries and burnout.",
      "\"Most adults are not failing in the gym because they are lazy. They are failing because no one ever taught them how to train for the stage of life they are in right now,\" a fitness trainer said. (iStock)",
      "\"The solution is simple: train smarter,\" he recommended to Fox News Digital. \"Follow principles of progressive overload and proper mechanics and make recovery days a priority.",
      "\"Longer warm-ups, mobility prep and respecting rest go a long way toward preventing setbacks.\"",
      "\"Walking, biking and spin classes are great, but if you avoid strength training, you lose muscle and power with every passing year,\" Sauzo told Fox News Digital. \"That makes you more likely to get hurt and slows recovery.\"",
      "Building muscle helps protect the joints, speeds up metabolism and ensures strength for life, according to the expert.",
      "\"They keep doing the same workouts they did years ago and wonder why their back aches, their knees are sore and their progress has stalled.\"",
      "Suazo confirmed that adults should strength train at least two times per week. \"Start light, master the form and progress slowly,\" he recommends.",
      "Markfeld agreed that many older adults stick only to cardio, thinking it\u2019s all they need.",
      "Building muscle helps protect the joints, speeds up metabolism and ensures strength for life, experts say. (iStock)",
      "\"The problem is, skipping resistance training accelerates muscle and bone loss, which are critical for staying active and independent,\" he reiterated.",
      "\"Including two to three days a week of strength and resistance-specific work is ideal. This can be as simple as body weight movements, resistance bands or dumbbells, focusing on compound/functional movements like squats, pushes and pulls.\"",
      "Going straight from sitting at a desk to lifting weights is a recipe for injury, according to Suazo.",
      "\"Cold muscles and stiff joints make even simple exercises harder than they should be,\" he warned.",
      "HOLLYWOOD ICON HAS USED THE SAME 12-MINUTE WORKOUT ROUTINE SINCE THE 1960S",
      "To help ensure a safe, successful workout, Suazo recommends spending five minutes preparing your body. This can include walking as well as doing hip openers, shoulder circles and a few body weight squats.",
      "\"You will lift better, feel better and recover faster,\" the expert said.",
      "\"Fast, sloppy reps and ego lifting are the reason most people end up with sore shoulders and bad backs,\" Suazo cautioned.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "The trainer emphasized the importance of slowing down.",
      "\"Choose a weight you can control, move with intention and feel the muscles working,\" he said. \"Controlled reps will keep you safe and build strength you can use.\"",
      "\"If you are sore all the time, you are not getting stronger, you are just breaking your body down,\" Suazo said. \"Strength is built when you recover, not just when you train.\"",
      "When you train this way, you will move better, feel younger and keep doing the things you love without pain holding you back,\" a trainer said. (iStock)",
      "It\u2019s important to make recovery part of your plan, the expert advised. This can include walking, stretching, taking an active recovery day and getting quality sleep.",
      "\"Your body will reward you by coming back stronger.\"",
      "\"Many people overlook mobility and balance work,\" Markfeld noted. \"These decline naturally with age and are major factors in injury risk.\"",
      "\"Focus on non-mirror training, slow your movements down and respect your recovery time.\"",
      "He suggests dedicating 10 to 15 minutes of every workout to joint mobility, core stability and balance exercises.",
      "\"Simple drills like ankle mobility before squats or single-leg balance work can have a huge payoff in long-term health,\" Markfeld said.",
      "For more Health articles, visit\u00a0www.foxnews.com/health",

      "\"He has been caught with his hand in the cookie jar, if you will. He's now trying to divert from that,\" Sherrill told reporters on Tuesday following a campaign event in Wildwood Crest, New Jersey.",
      "The combustible ballot box battle in New Jersey, which is one of only two elections for governor across the country this year, was rocked last week after a New Jersey Globe report revealed that Sherrill's military records indicated that the United States Naval Academy blocked her from taking part in her 1994 graduation amid the cheating scandal.",

      "\"What we learned today is that she was part of it in some way, shape or form. Come clean, release the records. Tell us what's in your disciplinary records. I think the people of New Jersey deserve that,\" Ciattarelli said Thursday night in an interview on Fox News' \"Hannity.\"",

      "On Tuesday, responding to Sherrill's comments, Russell told Fox News Digital that \"calling it a witch hunt is absurd. This is about getting to the bottom of what she did or didn\u2019t do at the academy that earned her an incredibly severe punishment.\"",
      "And Ciattarelli's top strategist argued that \"her story that she just didn\u2019t rat out some friends is likely a bunch of bull, and she knows and we want to know exactly what she told investigators. Did she lie to them? And how many times did she lie to them? And the only way we\u2019re going to ever figure out what happened is [if] she releases these records.\"",

      "\"They show my graduation from the Naval Academy, they show my commissioning, they show my service medals, they show the record of service that I have,\" she added.",

      "Fox News anchor Bret Baier explores how the technology is changing how the world operates on 'Special Report.'",
      "A New Jersey school district has adopted artificial intelligence to help detect weapons and stop threats before they escalate. The Glassboro Public School District has become the first in the country to combine AI gun detection with a mass communication system that speeds up emergency responses and reduces the time it takes to notify law enforcement.",

      "NORTH KOREAN HACKERS USE AI TO FORGE MILITARY IDS",
      "What's new in school security",
      "The district is using ZeroEyes, an AI video analytics platform that integrates with existing security cameras. The software scans for visible firearms and sends an alert whenever a potential threat appears. A team of military and law enforcement veterans at a 24/7 operations center then reviews the image to confirm whether the gun is real. Once verified, the system pushes an alert to school staff and police within three to five seconds. At the same time, buildings go into lockdown automatically.",
      "South Jersey schools have deployed AI to spot weapons and alert police in seconds. (Jay Janner/The Austin American-Statesman via Getty Images)",
      "These alerts are distributed through Singlewire Software's InformaCast platform. This system can send warnings across school PA systems, strobe lights, digital signs, desk phones and other communication tools. Together, the two technologies give law enforcement and educators a faster and more coordinated way to respond to potential dangers.",
      "How the system works",
      "Security cameras around each building feed video into the ZeroEyes software. When the AI detects what appears to be a firearm, it highlights the object and immediately shares the footage with human analysts. If those experts confirm that the weapon is real, they send the alert to the district and local authorities. InformaCast then pushes the message to every connected device, allowing staff and students to receive instructions within seconds. The goal is to shorten the time between detection and action so schools can respond before violence has a chance to unfold.",
      "Concerns to consider",
      "As with any new technology, questions remain. Even with human oversight, AI can make mistakes, and false alerts are always a possibility. Privacy also comes into play since the system depends on constant monitoring through security cameras. Cost is another factor because installing, maintaining and training staff for these systems requires significant funding. Finally, schools need to build community trust by explaining how the technology works and preparing students and parents for what to expect during drills or emergencies.",
      "SCAMMERS ARE ABUSING ICLOUD CALENDAR TO SEND PHISHING EMAILS",
      "Glassboro district becomes first in U.S. to pair AI gun detection with mass alerts. (Lori Van Buren/Albany Times Union via Getty Images)",
      "What this means for you",
      "For parents, teachers and students, this technology represents an important shift in how schools approach safety. AI adds speed to the process by recognizing threats before most people would even notice them. Alerts reach law enforcement and staff almost immediately, creating a critical advantage in a crisis. The system also provides a layered approach to protection by combining cameras, AI and communication tools. Parents may also find reassurance in knowing that human experts verify each threat to help reduce false alarms. While no system is perfect, this integration builds confidence that schools are investing in stronger defenses.",

The catch is that these downloads include both the real app and hidden malware.",

      "How hackers disguise fake apps as real ones",
      "So how do these fake sites end up in your search results in the first place? The attackers use a technique called SEO poisoning. They register lookalike domains, use plugins to game search algorithms and then climb up Google's rankings. That way, when you search for a trusted app, the fake site may appear as one of the first results.",
      "According to FortiGuard Labs, this particular campaign mainly targeted Chinese-speaking users, but the method is being used everywhere. In fact, earlier reports from Cisco Talos showed ransomware groups pushing fake downloads of AI tools like ChatGPT or InVideo. Others used spoofed sites for PayPal, Microsoft, Netflix and Apple. Sometimes, attackers even buy sponsored ads so that their malicious links appear right at the top.",
      "The scary part is that you might not even realize you installed something dangerous. Because the fake installer includes the real app, everything seems to work fine. Meanwhile, the hidden malware is already active on your device. That makes it harder to detect and much easier for attackers to steal your data.",

    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "Phishing attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and the latest scam takes exploitation of a trusted platform to a new level. Instead of sending generic or suspicious-looking emails, attackers are now abusing Apple's iCloud Calendar invite system to deliver phishing content directly from Apple's own email servers.",
      "This clever tactic allows the fraudulent messages to bypass spam filters and appear more legitimate to unsuspecting users. The goal is to alarm you into calling a scammer's fake support number under the pretense of disputing a fraudulent PayPal transaction. Once contacted, you are manipulated into granting remote access to your devices or sharing sensitive data.",

      "Scammers exploit Apple\u2019s iCloud Calendar to deliver phishing invites that bypass spam filters. (Brent Lewin/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "How the scam uses iCloud Calendar invites to bypass security",
      "The heart of this scam lies in abusing Apple's official infrastructure to lend credibility to a phishing attempt. Instead of using a suspicious or easily flagged email address, the attackers send calendar invites from Apple's genuine domain, noreply@email.apple.com, as reported by Bleeping Computer.",
      "The attacker embeds the phishing message in the \"Notes\" section of the calendar event, making it appear as a legitimate notification. They send the calendar invite to a Microsoft 365 email address they control, which is part of a mailing list. As a result, the invite is automatically forwarded to multiple real targets, broadening the scam\u2019s reach.",
      "Typically, when emails are forwarded, SPF (Sender Policy Framework) checks fail because the forwarding server isn't listed as an authorized sender. However, Microsoft 365 uses a technique called the Sender Rewriting Scheme (SRS), which rewrites the return path so that the message still passes SPF checks.",
      "This makes the email appear fully legitimate to both the recipient's inbox and automated spam filters. As a result, the message is far more likely to reach a user's inbox without being flagged, increasing the chance the victim will take the bait.",
      "SCAMMERS ARE USING DOCUSIGN EMAILS TO PUSH APPLE PAY FRAUD",
      "Cybercriminals leverage Microsoft 365 forwarding and Apple\u2019s email domain to outsmart filters. (Lindsey Nicholson/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)",
      "Why these phishing scams are particularly dangerous",
      "What makes this campaign especially dangerous is the sense of legitimacy it conveys. Because Apple\u2019s official servers send the email directly, users are far less likely to suspect foul play. The message itself aims to panic the recipient by falsely claiming a large PayPal transaction occurred without the recipient's consent. The message includes a phone number to \"contact support\" and dispute the charge, but, in reality, it connects the victim to a scammer.",
      "Once the victim calls the number, the scammer poses as a technical support agent and attempts to convince the caller that the computer has been compromised. The next step is typically to ask the victim to download remote access software under the guise of issuing a refund or securing the account.",
      "In reality, this access is used to steal banking information, install malware or exfiltrate personal data. Because the original message passed security checks and seemed credible, victims often don't think twice before acting.",
      "DON\u2019T FALL FOR THIS BANK PHISHING SCAM TRICK",
      "Fraudsters are hijacking iCloud Calendar invites to trick users into calling fake support lines. (Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "6 ways you can stay safe from iCloud Calendar scammers",
      "I have listed some useful steps you can take to protect yourself from falling victim to these increasingly sophisticated phishing scams:",
      "If you receive an unexpected calendar invite, especially one containing a strange message or alarming claims, don't open it or respond. Legitimate companies rarely send payment disputes or security warnings through calendar invites. Always verify suspicious claims by logging into your official account directly.",
      "Phishing scams often include phone numbers that connect you to fraudsters posing as support agents. Instead of calling the number in the message, use official contact details found on the company's official website.",
      "Antivirus programs protect your computer from malware and phishing sites by blocking suspicious downloads and warning you about unsafe websites.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Also, keeping your antivirus updated ensures it can defend against the latest threats.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Hackers are able to send you these phishing emails because they have your data. Using a personal data removal service helps scrub your personal information from data broker websites. This makes it significantly harder for attackers to gather details about you and craft convincing, targeted phishing attacks.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "A password manager helps you generate and securely store strong, unique passwords for every account. This reduces the risk of reusing weak passwords that scammers can easily exploit to gain unauthorized access to your accounts.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Scammers are taking phishing attacks in a disturbing new direction by manipulating trusted platforms to deliver malicious content. The safest approach is to treat any unexpected calendar invite, especially those with alarming messages or strange contact numbers, with extreme caution. Never call the number provided in the message or click on any links. Instead, go directly to official websites or your account's official dashboard to verify suspicious activity.",

      "FBI WARNS SENIORS ABOUT BILLION-DOLLAR SCAM DRAINING RETIREMENT FUNDS, EXPERT SAYS AI DRIVING IT",
      "1. The dog walker overpayment scam",
      "Bob from Harrison, Ohio, recently shared how he was nearly tricked by a scammer posing as a pet owner. The con began with a request for dog sitting. Bob was promised $250 for care and food, but then a fake check for $4,358 arrived.",
      "The scammer instructed Bob to send $4,000 of it to an \"appliance retailer.\" Why an appliance retailer when the service was for dog sitting? Scammers often use a third party to make the request sound more believable. If they simply asked for the money back, it would raise red flags. By inventing another company, whether a retailer, shipping service or contractor, they add urgency and legitimacy to the story. In reality, that \"retailer\" is just another front that the scammer controls. Here's the catch: the check appears to be real, but it's actually counterfeit. The bank may release the funds temporarily, but once it bounces, you're on the hook for the entire amount.",
      "Making a payment by scanning a QR code with a phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip: If you're asked to forward money to a third party, especially one unrelated to the original deal, treat it as a scam. Keep the check and envelope as evidence, and report it to the FTC and your state attorney general.",
      "2. The online marketplace scam",
      "Selling a couch, bike or electronics online? Some buyers \"accidentally\" send too much. They then ask you to return the difference through Zelle, Venmo or a wire transfer. Once the check or payment reverses, you've lost both the product and the money you returned.",

      "You might get an email or letter offering a job as a mystery shopper. They send you a large check to \"test\" stores by buying gift cards. You're asked to send the gift card numbers back as proof of purchase. After the bank reverses the fake check, you've lost the money you spent on those gift cards.",
      "Tip: Real companies never pay upfront with extra funds or ask for gift card codes by email.",
      "4. The rental deposit scam",
      "Scammers target renters by mailing a check for more than the deposit or rent. They claim it was a mistake and ask you to refund the difference. The check later bounces, leaving you stuck.",

      "5. The work-from-home equipment scam",

Someone sends you too much money and pressures you to forward the extra. That \"extra\" never existed, and once the check bounces, you're left holding the bag. The good news is, there are clear steps you can take to protect yourself and keep your money safe.",
      "Every scam in this article, from the dog walker hoax to rental deposit tricks, begins with an overpayment that looks harmless. If someone pays you more than you're owed, it's not a mistake. It's a scam. Do not respond or send money to any third party. Save the check and envelope as evidence, then report it.",
      "Scammers count on you trusting what you see in your account. In Bob's case, his $4,358 check looked real because the bank showed it as \"available.\" But available isn't the same as cleared. Always ask your bank to confirm when funds are fully verified before you spend a dime.",
      "Urgency is the scammer's strongest weapon. Marketplace fraudsters, renters and fake employers will pressure you to \"fix\" the mistake right away. Slow down, double-check and don't let anyone force you into quick action.",
      "Whether it's for rent, freelance work or selling a used item, scammers prefer paper checks because they're easy to fake. Stick with secure, traceable payment platforms or in-person verified funds. That way, you don't get stuck when a check bounces.",
      "If you receive a suspicious check, save everything: the envelope, emails, texts and any names used. In the dog sitting scam, Bob's saved emails and the scammer's phone number became valuable evidence. This documentation helps law enforcement and protects you if the scammer tries again under another identity.",
      "Scammers often find victims by scraping personal details from online data brokers. That's how they target renters, pet sitters or jobseekers. Using a personal data removal service can limit your exposure and make you harder to target in the first place. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",
      "Check out my top picks for data removal services and get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web by visiting\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web:\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Many banks let you set fraud alerts for large deposits or unusual transactions. Turning these on gives you a chance to review suspicious activity before a scammer pressures you into acting on it.",
      "Just like Bob did when he cut contact with the fake pet owner, reporting scams helps protect others. File with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at reportfraud.ftc.gov and your state attorney general. You can also alert your local police and community groups to stop scammers from targeting someone else.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Overpayment scams prey on trust and urgency. They can pop up in online sales, job offers, rental agreements and even friendly community boards. By knowing the warning signs, you can stop scammers before they reach your wallet. Stay cautious whenever you're asked to deposit more than expected and forward the extra. If it sounds strange, it's probably a scam.",

      "\"But let's say the Trump administration could convince the Taliban to consider allowing the U.S. to return to Bagram,\" he continued. \"The Chinese would come down hard.\"",

      "Elon Musk has once again entered the British political fray, this time promoting a new right-wing party, Advance UK, while criticizing the leader of the rapidly growing and influential Reform UK party, Nigel Farage.",
      "Musk recently posted on X: Go with @_AdvanceUK, Ben [Habib] and Tommy [Robinson] for the real change that\u2019s needed to save Britain!\" In another post, he said, \"Advance UK will actually drive change. Farage is weak sauce who will do nothing.\"",

      "The billionaire also took aim at the man who could be Britain's next prime minister and claimed Nigel Farage \"doesn\u2019t have what it takes.\" That was before the birth of Advance UK. More recently, he said, \"There needs to be massive government reform in Britain and the people need to be in charge, not some bureaucracy that doesn\u2019t care.\"",
      "The right-leaning party, which is close to officially registering, is led by Ben Habib, a former co-deputy chairman of Reform UK. \"The two-party system is dead,\" Habib said. \"The Conservatives and Labour Party have had their chance, and now the people want something new.\"",
      "\"You clearly don\u2019t have a two-party system,\" said Alan Mendoza, executive director of the Henry Jackson Society think tank. However, he asked: \"Will this system produce a majority government and whether, for example, at the end of the process it delivers a main opposition party.\"",
      "Part of the fragmentation of British politics is the widespread disgust of political leaders. Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage all received unfavorable views between 52% and 68%, according to data from polling organization YouGov.",

      "Despite the negative view of Farage, Reform UK leads in the polls in the event of a general election, according to the polling company Ipsos. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean Reform will win at the next election.",
      "\"If there was an election tomorrow, then it would likely win,\" Mendoza says. However, we don\u2019t know when the next election will be, which makes it near impossible to predict at this stage, he says. \"The golden law of British politics is you can\u2019t predict the vote that far ahead.\"",

      "When asked why Advance UK is needed when Farage's party is far ahead in the polls, Habib said, \"Reform will not deliver. It stands for nothing. It is a populist party without a political philosophy and without intellectual heft or capability,\" Habib said, claiming \"Farage has a patriotic persona, but he is nothing more than a political expedient. He would be worse than [former Prime Minister] Boris Johnson.\"",
      "Nevertheless, it doesn\u2019t look like Advance U.K. will split the vote with Reform. According to Mendoza, bringing Robinson into the party may have been a mistake. During the recent rally, some protestors allegedly attacked police officers. \"Most people will not like violence at a political rally,\" he said. \"And they won\u2019t support the party.\"",
      "One of the leading frustrations voters have at the moment is that neither the current government nor the last one has managed to stop the surge of legal and illegal immigration. In fact, it has worsened. Almost 50,000 undocumented immigrants, many seeking asylum, arrived in Britain in the 12 months through June. That\u2019s up from around 39,000 at the same time the previous year, according to government data.",
      "On Saturday, the Daily Telegraph reported that migrants now account for 98% of the latest rise in population. According to the Office for National Statistics, the Telegraph reported, 69.3 million people were estimated to be living in the country in mid-2024, up 755,254 from the same time in 2023.",

      "\"We need a holistic solution to reduce immigration,\" Habib said. He also said borders must be enforced and illegal migrants deported. Worse still, those asylum-seekers are living in hotels at taxpayers\u2019 expense of \u00a35.8 million a day ($7.4 million).",

      "Earlier this summer, protests over asylum hotels erupted in Epping, southeast England. Separately, Farage suspended one of his local councilors over accusations of racism during the demonstration.",
      "Elon Musk responded to Farage's suspending the council member on X. He wrote: \"Farage is weak, runny sauce. He won\u2019t let Reform even stand up for their own people, e.g. punishing their Epping member, and he will change nothing of significance politically.\"",

Such incidents appear to be fast becoming the norm.",
      "Yet despite Musk's criticism, a new opinion poll released on Friday in the U.K. by YouGov showed Farage's Reform UK on target to deliver a massive defeat of Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his ruling Labour Party if an election were to be held.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The federal government is barreling toward a shutdown Tuesday night, with President Donald Trump and Democratic leaders engaged in a fierce blame game and trading insults about each other.",
      "Hours before the midnight deadline, the Senate on Tuesday gaveled out for the evening with plans to return on Wednesday. A shutdown is all but assured to begin after midnight.",
      "It's unclear where the parties go from here. The Senate Tuesday evening voted down competing Republican and Democratic plans to stave off a shutdown.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said he hoped the defeat of the GOP bill \u2014 for a second time this month \u2014 \"will open lines of communications\" with Republicans. That has not yet happened.",
      "\u201cLeader Schumer and I have made clear we are ready, willing and able to sit down and with anyone, anytime, any place to fund the government and to address the Republican health care crisis,\" Jeffries said shortly before the Senate votes.",
      "Bipartisan talks have been at a standstill in the 24 hours since the Big Four congressional leaders met with Trump at the White House Monday.",
      "The impacts of a shutdown would be felt by many. None of the millions of federal workers would be paid, and hundreds of thousands of them would be furloughed. In recent days, White House officials had tried to allow military personnel to continue receiving pay during a shutdown, according to a source familiar with the discussions, but those efforts were unsuccessful. So service members wouldn\u2019t be paid during a shutdown, either.",
      "And the White House has threatened to fire federal workers in a shutdown as well. Asked Tuesday morning how many government employees his administration would lay off, Trump responded: \u201cWell, we may do a lot, and that\u2019s only because of the Democrats.\u201d",
      "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated Tuesday that a government shutdown would lead to the furlough of about 750,000 federal employees.",
      "Responding to Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, who asked for the assessment, the CBO said of the furloughed workers: The \u201ctotal daily cost of their compensation would be roughly $400 million. The number of furloughed employees could vary by the day because some agencies might furlough more employees the longer a shutdown persists and others might recall some initially furloughed employees.\u201d",
      "Federal agencies, including the Defense and State departments, have already posted their plans for how they will operate.",
      "In the final hours before a shutdown, the two parties traded insults rather than serious proposals.",
      "Trump shared a crude post on Truth Social Monday night that showed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., with fake AI-generated audio, saying Democrats \u201chave no voters anymore, because of our woke, trans bulls---\u201d and that if they give undocumented immigrants health care, they would vote for his party.",
      "The post depicted Jeffries wearing a sombrero and a mustache as he stood silently by Schumer's side. Mariachi music played in the background.",
      "The video referenced a Trump talking point that Democrats are demanding health care for undocumented immigrants in exchange for their votes to keep the government open. Democrats have called that a lie. They have pushed to extend expiring Obamacare subsidies and to undo Trump's Medicaid cuts, not to pay for health care for people who are in the country illegally.",
      "Schumer responded to the video on X, writing: \u201cIf you think your shutdown is a joke, it just proves what we all know: You can\u2019t negotiate. You can only throw tantrums.\u201d",
      "Jeffries had tough words for Trump during a news conference on the steps of the Capitol on Tuesday morning. \"Mr. President, next time you have something to say about me, don\u2019t cop out through a racist and fake AI video,\" Jeffries said, surrounded by dozens of rank-and-file Democrats. \"When I\u2019m back in the Oval Office, say it to my face.\"",
      "The House leader also shared a photo on X of Trump with Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender. \"This is real,\" Jeffries wrote above the photo, which was taken at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in 1997. (Trump has said he and Epstein had a falling out, and he was unaware of the financier's crimes.)",
      "The personal insults indicated that the two sides were nowhere close to an agreement to keep the government's lights on past Tuesday's deadline.",
      "\u201cIt looks to me like we\u2019re headed for a shutdown,\" said Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., earlier Tuesday. \"And you know me, I\u2019m the most optimistic person you know.\u201d",
      "Political theater dominated on Tuesday. Democrats filed onto the House floor during a pro forma session as the party's top appropriator, Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, attempted to offer her party's plan to keep the government open. But Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Va., who was presiding, did not acknowledge her and quickly adjourned.",
      "\u201cShame on you!\" some Democrats jeered at Griffith.",
      "Democrats on the floor had a poster with Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s face on it and the words: \u201cMissing Person.\u201d Johnson, R-La., was in the Capitol on Tuesday and attended the Trump meeting a day earlier. But the House left town Sept. 19 after passing a seven-week funding bill and is not set to return until Oct. 7.",
      "By Tuesday evening, the GOP-controlled Senate made a last-gasp attempt to avert a shutdown but came up short. The upper chamber voted down competing Democratic and Republican funding plans, a repeat of earlier this month when the same bills failed to reach the 60-vote threshold needed to pass.",
      "The GOP bill had cleared the House on a party-line 217-212 vote on Sept. 19, but it was rejected Tuesday in the Senate 55-45, shy of the 60 votes needed to break a Democratic filibuster. Three members of the Democratic Caucus \u2014 Sens. John Fetterman, D-Pa., Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., and Angus King, I-Maine \u2014 joined Republicans in voting yes; just one Republican, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, voted no with Democrats.",
      "The rival Democratic bill to fund the government was also rejected, on a party-line 47-53 vote.",
      "Republicans have argued that Democrats could avert a shutdown by simply voting for the House-passed continuing resolution, or CR, which would fund the government at current levels through Nov. 21.",
      "But Democrats said they are trying to stave off a looming \"health care crisis.\" Specifically, Democrats want any CR to include an extension of Obamacare subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year. They have also pushed for rolling back some of the cuts and changes to Medicaid that were enacted in Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year.",
      "Speaking to reporters in the Capitol after Monday's meeting with Trump, Schumer said Trump appeared to be \"not aware\" of the impacts of expiring Obamacare subsidies on everyday Americans. And he urged Trump to try to convince GOP leaders on Capitol Hill to back a deal to extend those subsidies.",
      "\"It\u2019s now in the president\u2019s hands,\" Schumer said, with Jeffries at his side. \"He can avoid a shutdown if he gets the Republican leaders to go along with what we want.\""

    "story": [
      "The federal government finds itself hours away from shutting down if Congress does not pass a funding bill by the end of Tuesday.",
      "Numerous agencies and departments have issued guidance in recent days on what to expect if there's a funding lapse. But several have yet to release details on the potential impact on operations, an unusual lack of information so close to the funding deadline when compared to previous shutdowns.",
      "Here\u2019s what happens if Democrats and Republicans fail to pass legislation that would keep the government open.",
      "How does a shutdown affect the military?",
      "The majority of veteran benefits and military operations will continue to be funded regardless of a shutdown. However, pay for military and civilian workers will be delayed until a funding deal is reached, forcing them to continue their duties without pay.",
      "Military personnel on active duty, including active guard reserves, will continue their duty. However, no new orders may be issued except for extenuating circumstances \u2014 such as disaster response or national security. Some National Guard members serving through federal funding could have their orders terminated unless performing an essential duty.",
      "The Department of Veterans Affairs said it expects 97% of its employees to work, though regional offices will be closed. Some death benefits, such as the placement of permanent headstones at VA cemeteries, and ground maintenance, will cease. Also affected will be communication lines, including hotlines, emails, social media and responses to press inquiries.",
      "How is air travel affected?",
      "Air traffic control services will continue, allowing for 13,227 air traffic controllers to work through a shutdown \u2014 but without pay until the government is funded again. Other essential activities, such as the certification and oversight of commercial airplanes and engines will continue, as will limited air traffic safety oversight.",
      "However, the Department of Transportation will stop air traffic controller hiring, field training of air traffic controllers, facility security inspections and law enforcement assistance support.",
      "In a letter Monday, a coalition of aviation groups urged Congress to stop the shutdown, saying funding lapses will hurt the Federal Aviation Administration. The letter cited the furloughing of many FAA employees, and said the ceasing of funding could create backlogs that will create delays in critical FAA services \u201clong after funding resumes.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile air traffic controllers, technicians and other excepted aviation safety professionals will continue to work without pay, many of the employees who support them are furloughed, and the programs that the FAA uses to review and address safety events are suspended. To remain the world leader in aviation, we must continue to strive to improve efficiency and further mitigate risk,\u201d the aviation groups wrote.",
      "Will Social Security checks still go out?",
      "Social Security benefits, considered mandatory under law, will continue regardless of a shutdown, so recipients can expect to continue receiving their payments. However, the Social Security Administration could face a furloughed workforce. Fewer workers could mean that processing new Social Security applications could be delayed.",
      "How does the shutdown affect the Department of Health and Human Services?",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 home to agencies such as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Food and Drug Administration \u2014 said in its contingency plan that it expects more than 32,000 of its nearly 80,000 workers to be furloughed in case of a shutdown.",
      "HHS said that \u201cexcepted activities\u201d will continue, offering as an example responses to pandemic, flu and hurricanes. Additionally, the National Institutes of Health will continue research and clinical services necessary to protect human life and government property.",
      "Still, research contracts and grants to external organizations, such as universities, will freeze, and NIH will not admit new patients to its research hospital unless medically necessary. HHS also said it will not process Freedom of Information Act requests during a shutdown.",
      "How is the FDA affected?",
      "The FDA will continue exempt activities, which include drug and medical device reviews and recalls, monitoring and response of foodborne illnesses and the flu, pursuing some investigations when the agency believes the public is at risk, and screening food and medical products imported to the U.S.",
      "The agency warned it would end its ability to monitor the use of new ingredients in animal food, and thus would not be able to ensure that meat, milk and eggs of livestock are safe for the public to eat. Long-term food safety initiatives would also be stopped during a shutdown.",
      "The FDA will not process new drug applications and medical device submissions. The agency warned it will not support staff that oversee protection of unsafe or ineffective drugs unless it is an imminent threat.",
      "Are students able to get loans for school?",
      "The Department of Education will continue to disburse student aid through Pell Grants and Federal Direct Student Loans \u2014 assistance that goes to nearly 10 million students at 5,400 schools, the department said.",
      "But borrowers still need to make their loan payments during a shutdown, the memo added.",
      "In the first week of a government shutdown, the department will furlough about 95% of staff who don't work on federal student aid, the memo said. The department will also halt new grant-making activities during a lapse in funding.",
      "What is the impact on the CDC?",
      "The CDC will continue to monitor and respond to disease outbreaks, but it will be hampered in providing the public with health-related information, its contingency plan said.",
      "The agency also won't be able to provide state and local health departments with guidance on things like preventing opioid overdoses, HIV and diabetes.",
      "Some other operations will similarly grind to a halt, including responses to inquiries about public health issues and the analysis of surveillance data for certain diseases, the Department of Health and Human Services said.",
      "The department also said slightly more than a third of the staff at the CDC and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry will continue working during a shutdown.",
      "How are nutritional programs for the the poor and women and children affected?",
      "The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps, and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children could be affected  by a shutdown, according to several congressional offices, including Democratic Reps. Greg Stanton, of Arizona, and Shontel Brown, of Ohio.",
      "\"USDA funds cover SNAP benefits for roughly one month of a shutdown, but a longer shutdown could mean that this funding runs out,\" added the office of Rep. Sarah Elfreth, D-Md.",
      "While the department has not put out detailed guidance, it said in last year's shutdown contingency plan that SNAP, WIC and similar programs would continue during a shutdown \"subject to the availability of funding.\"",
      "Will national parks stay open?",
      "The National Park Service has not yet issued new shutdown guidance, but its plan from previous years said parks will generally be closed during a funding lapse.",
      "The agency, which falls under the Department of Interior, discouraged people from visiting sites that are still physically accessible during a closure, noting there would be \"significantly reduced visitor services.\" It also said parks will not be able to provide regular road or trail condition updates and website and social media will not be maintained.",
      "In the past, the National Park Service also planned to reduce its nearly 20,000 personnel by about a third during a shutdown.",
      "Can I still go to Smithsonian museums or the National Zoo in Washington, D.C.?",
      "The Smithsonian Institution's museums and National Zoo \u2014 major draws for visitors to the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 said Tuesday afternoon that they will use funds from the previous year to remain open to the public at least through Oct. 6.",
      "Will federal workers be paid during a shutdown?",
      "No, federal workers will largely not be paid during a shutdown. Employees who are considered essential must still report to work, although they will not be paid until the government reopens.",
      "Furloughed and essential employees will receive back pay after a shutdown ends.",
      "President Donald Trump and members of Congress, however, will continue to receive paychecks during a shutdown. Their pay is constitutionally protected."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Millions of federal workers wouldn\u2019t get paid during a government shutdown. But the people who could prevent or end a shutdown \u2014 members of Congress \u2014 would still receive a paycheck.",
      "That\u2019s because their pay is protected under Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution, which states: \u201cThe Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\u201d",
      "The Constitution \u201csays members will be paid,\u201d Rep. Joe Morelle of New York, the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee, explained to reporters Tuesday.",
      "Some lawmakers don\u2019t like that practice \u2014 or the optics of it.",
      "Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., is one of a handful of lawmakers asking that their paycheck be withheld in the event of a shutdown.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s wrong that the President and Members of Congress get paid during a government shutdown when our military and public servants don\u2019t,\u201d Kim said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cI will be refusing my own pay if we end up in a shutdown. Government leaders shouldn\u2019t be playing with other people\u2019s chips.\u201d",
      "Presidents also get paid during a funding lapse. President Donald Trump donated his government salary during his first term and said he\u2019s doing the same this time as well.",
      "In a letter to the head of the Senate Disbursing Office, Kim formally requested that his paycheck be withheld until the government reopens. Across the Capitol, Rep. Kat Cammack, R-Fla., made a similar request in a letter Tuesday to the House\u2019s chief administrator that she shared on X.",
      "\u201cThe Democrats want to shut down the government because we won\u2019t give them free healthcare for illegals. On top of that, they won\u2019t even pass a bill that protects our military or border patrol agents pay in the event of a shutdown!\u201d she wrote on X. \u201cSo let\u2019s see if they are willing to give up their pay as well; I\u2019ll start.\u201d",
      "Democratic leaders have disputed that they want to give undocumented immigrants free health care, calling that a lie. In their funding proposal, Democrats are pushing to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies that expire at the end of the calendar year and roll back cuts and changes to Medicaid enacted in Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf our service members and federal workers won\u2019t get paid because of Trump and far-right extremists, Members of Congress shouldn\u2019t either,\u201d Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., posted on X on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019ll keep fighting to lower health care costs and work across the aisle to keep the government open.\u201d",
      "Some lawmakers said they can\u2019t afford missing a pay period.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not wealthy, and I have three kids. I would basically be missing, you know, mortgage payments, rent payments, child support,\u201d Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., told NBC News. \u201cSo it\u2019s not feasible, not gonna happen.\u201d",
      "Most members of Congress receive a salary of $174,000; lawmakers in the top leadership posts receive more.",
      "While most federal workers would be furloughed and sent home during a shutdown, active-duty service members would still need to show up for work without getting paid. The same would go for so-called excepted or essential civilian workers.",
      "That includes people like air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration agents, who help ensure public safety and national security.",
      "In previous shutdowns, employees at intelligence agencies typically have been treated as essential workers and were required to continue to report to work.",
      "But according to internal policy guidance for the Defense Department obtained by NBC News, employees working on intelligence that is not directly related to current or planned military operations, such as political and economic intelligence, would not be required to report to work and are not in the \u201cexcepted\u201d category of federal workers.",
      "Under the Pentagon contingency plan, employees working on intelligence activities deemed essential for national security would continue to report to work.",
      "Because of a law Congress passed in 2019, federal employees \u2014 including legislative branch employees \u2014 are guaranteed to receive back pay following a shutdown, regardless of if they were in furlough status.",
      "At the Department of Homeland Security, most Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees would not be paid during a shutdown, but they would still be required to work, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said.",
      "Roughly 150,000 employees from CBP, ICE and the U.S. Secret Service would be affected by a shutdown, as well as about 47,000 U.S. Coast Guard employees."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday heavily criticized the Trump administration's crackdown on free speech as he ruled in favor of foreign students the government has targeted for their support of Palestinian rights.",
      "Massachusetts-based U.S. District Judge William Young, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan, ruled that foreign students enjoy the same free speech protections under the Constitution's First Amendment as American citizens do.",
      "He found that government officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, \"deliberately and with purposeful aforethought, did so concert their actions and those of their two departments intentionally to chill the rights to freedom of speech and peacefully to assemble.\"",
      "Touching upon tensions within the judiciary over how to respond to harsh criticism from the administration, Young included a threatening message he received via a postcard from an anonymous critic that read, \"Trump has pardons and tanks .... what do you have?\"",
      "Young responded in a note at the top of his ruling, saying he had \"nothing but my sense of duty.\"",
      "The 161-page decision included a final 13-page section that served as a damning indictment of President Donald Trump's second term in office, portraying him as a vainglorious bully who is enacting an agenda based on retribution.",
      "Young cited Trump's orders that targeted law firms, universities and the media, which have fared badly in court, as examples.",
      "\"The Constitution, our civil laws, regulations, mores, customs, practices, courtesies \u2014\u00a0all of it; the President simply ignores it all when he takes it into his head to act,\" Young wrote.",
      "\"The president's palpable misunderstanding that the government simply cannot seek retribution for speech he disdains poses a great threat to Americans' freedom of speech,\" he added.",
      "The lawsuit \u2014 brought by the American Association of University Professors and the Middle East Studies Association \u2014 alleged that the Trump administration violated the First Amendment by creating an ideological deportation policy to remove noncitizen campus activists for expressing pro-Palestinian sentiments.",
      "During the trial, Department of Homeland Security officials confirmed that a majority of the names of student protesters flagged to the agency for potential deportation came from Canary Mission, a website run by an anonymous group that maintains a database of students, professors and others who, it claims, shared anti-Israel and antisemitic viewpoints.",
      "High-profile examples include the detention of Mahmoud Khalil, who was involved in protests at Columbia University, and Tufts University graduate student R\u00fcmeysa \u00d6zt\u00fcrk.",
      "Jameel Jaffer, executive director at the Knight First Amendment Institute, which represents the challengers, said in a statement the ruling should have an immediate impact on the Trump administration's policies.",
      "\"If the First Amendment means anything, it means the government can\u2019t imprison people simply because it disagrees with their political views,\" he said.",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment. DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "A beacon of the early internet is about to be silenced.",
      "AOL\u2019s dial-up internet service is shutting down Tuesday, ending one of the web\u2019s first mainstream access points.",
      "Once a dominant technology player, AOL, initially called America Online, provided the gateway for millions of people to get their first taste of the web. Signing into the service \u2014 a process accompanied by a noisy, garbled series of computerized tones that sounded like a drowning robot \u2014 became a rite of passage.",
      "Once online, they would be greeted by a chipper if vaguely mechanical voice exclaiming \u201cWelcome! You\u2019ve Got Mail!\u201d The phrase grew so familiar that it became the title of a blockbuster romantic comedy starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.",
      "At its peak, AOL counted more than 20 million users and in 2000 became part of the largest corporate deal in history when it merged with Time Warner in a deal that gave the combined companies a value of approximately $350 billion. But as broadband internet became more accessible \u2014 and as a host of more sophisticated web browsers came on the scene \u2014 AOL began shedding users. In 2021, it was sold along with Yahoo \u2014 with which it had merged after both were acquired by Verizon \u2014 for $5 billion to the private equity giant Apollo.",
      "The dial-up shutdown was first reported in August. A representative for AOL did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a brief note posted to its help page, the company said the decision was made as part of a routine evaluation of its products and services.",
      "AOL remains active today: CNBC reported in 2021 that 1.5 million monthly customers paid for AOL\u2019s technical support and identity theft services, equating to as much as $180 million in annual revenue. AOL also continues to offer email services.",
      "A fair number of internet users \u2014 especially in rural or remote areas where broadband Internet is not available or is too expensive \u2014 also still rely on dial-up: as many as 163,000, according to recent U.S. Census data.

    "story": [
      "Melinda Johnson's life used to look very different.",
      "Two years ago, she was charged with chemical endangerment, among other drug-related offenses, for using methamphetamine while she was pregnant. Johnson, then 42, said that the pregnancy was unplanned and that she was grappling with a substance use disorder.",
      "People misunderstand addiction and recovery, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not something that happens at the snap of the finger. There\u2019s no switch to shut that off.\u201d",
      "Many women have found themselves in the same position. Over a two-year period, prosecutors across 16 states charged more than 400 people with pregnancy-related crimes, with most of the charges originating in states with near or total abortion bans, according to a new report released Tuesday.",
      "The prosecutions were initiated in the two years after the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade in 2022, according to Pregnancy Justice, a nonprofit legal group that advocates for pregnant people, which released the report.",
      "In the wake of that decision, Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, supporters of abortion rights expressed concern that losing the national right to abortion would bring increased scrutiny of women during pregnancy, pregnancy loss or birth. In Georgia, for instance, a woman was arrested and charged in March after, authorities said, she disposed of her miscarried fetus in a dumpster. The charges were ultimately dropped.",
      "Researchers at Pregnancy Justice say the number of prosecutions is likely to be higher than the 412 reported.  Because of a change in methodology, they couldn\u2019t say with certainty whether it\u2019s higher than before Dobbs.",
      "\u201cWithout having the ability to look at every single county across the country, that is an alarming number,\u201d said Dana Sussman, the group\u2019s senior vice president. \u201cAnd it should alarm all of us.\u201d",
      "Anti-abortion advocates have stressed that women seeking abortions won\u2019t be criminalized under current abortion bans. While physicians can face prison time for performing abortions not covered by exceptions, the bans exclude the women from criminal charges.",
      "But the report notes that references to abortion have surfaced in some instances. In at least nine cases, it says, there were \u201callegations pertaining to an abortion.\u201d In three cases, charging documents referred to abortion medication.",
      "The most common charges involved accusations of child abuse, neglect or endangerment, according to the report. Almost all the cases involved allegations of substance use during pregnancy. In 268 cases, or roughly 65% of the cases counted, that was the sole allegation of wrongdoing.",
      "Those prosecutions aren\u2019t evenly spread. In Alabama, where nearly half of the cases were brought, some prosecutors have been particularly aggressive about charging pregnant women accused of drug use. The state\u2019s attorney general, Steve Marshall, expressed support for such charges as a district attorney in the hope that they would deter women from using drugs while pregnant. He didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.",
      "When Johnson was arrested two years ago, she was held in jail for weeks before she was transferred to one of the few rehab facilities in Alabama that takes pregnant women and those with children.",
      "Today, Johnson has joint custody of her 2-year-old daughter. The state has custody of her 11-year-old twin boys but allows them to live with her. Her plea deal enabled her to avoid jail time, but she said she owes thousands of dollars in fees and fines. She now works in peer support for Aletheia House, a treatment facility, teaching life skills to women who face similar charges.",
      "\u201cI just love restoring faith in those women,\u201d she said.",
      "Still, she thinks handcuffs and jail bars aren\u2019t the way to assist pregnant Alabamians struggling with substance use in a state that bans abortion with few exceptions.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just not right for us to have to face these charges when we\u2019re in the middle of the worst darkness and addiction,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Under the state\u2019s chemical endangerment law, a convicted person can face up to a decade in jail if prosecutors don\u2019t allege the fetus, or child, was harmed. If serious harm is alleged, the maximum sentence can climb to 20 years or more. The statute, initially passed in 2006 as a response to the rise in home meth labs, has since been used to charge pregnant women accused of drug use.",
      "The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has opposed legislative efforts to criminalize pregnant drug users.",
      "\u201cDrug enforcement policies that deter women from seeking prenatal care are contrary to the welfare of the mother and fetus,\u201d it said in a brief.",
      "Although Alabama charged women with chemical endangerment before Roe\u2019s fall, Sussman said, the Dobbs decision \u201cfurther opens the door\u201d to the concept of fetal personhood, in which legal rights are extended to fetuses or even embryos.",
      "Fetal personhood has been recognized through judicial decisions in the three states \u2014 Alabama, Oklahoma and South Carolina, according to an analysis by Pregnancy Justice \u2014  accounting for the most prosecutions in the group's count.",
      "\u201cThis ideology around giving rights to embryos and fetuses is not theoretical,\u201d Sussman said. \u201cIt has real-world implications, devastating implications for the rights of pregnant people.\u201d",
      "Sussman noted that in 15 states during the 2024-25 legislative cycle, bills were introduced that would create or allow homicide charges for people who have abortions. None became law, but attempts persist. On Wednesday, a committee in the South Carolina Legislature is scheduled to hold a hearing on a total abortion ban bill that would allow homicide charges for some abortions.",
      "Sussman acknowledged the troubling number of maternal deaths from overdoses and said the crisis should be treated as a public health priority, rather than a criminal matter.",
      "Johnson sees it that way, too. She said she\u2019s determined to stay clean and feels she has found her purpose. Still, \u201cI have to fight every day,\u201d she said. Addiction is \u201calways doing pushups in the back, just waiting on me.\u201d"

      "The Dutch actor said at the Zurich Summit in Switzerland on Sept. 27 that companies are interested in using Norwood.",
      "\u201cWe were in a lot of boardrooms around February time, and everyone was like, \u2018No, this is nothing. It\u2019s not going to happen\u2019. Then, by May, people were like, \u2018We need to do something with you guys.\u2019 When we first launched Tilly, people were like, \u2018What\u2019s that?' and now we\u2019re going to be announcing which agency is going to be representing her in the next few months,\u201d Van der Velden said in her presentation, according to Deadline.",

      "Johansson's famously smoky voice was used in the 2013 science-fiction movie \"Her\" to power a fictionalized AI chatbot. OpenAI denied modeling the assistant after Johansson, but ultimately suspended using the voice.",
      "The use of artificial intelligence by film studios was also a crucial bargaining point in the actors' strike in 2023. Actors, directors and other creators were concerned their likenesses or voices could be used in films, movies and other creations without their compensation or consent.",
      "The SAG-AFTRA union weighed in with a statement after learning about Tilly Norwood.",
      "\"SAG-AFTRA believes creativity is, and should remain, human-centered,\" the union said. \"The union is opposed to the replacement of human performers by synthetics.",

      "\u201cIt has no life experience to draw from, no emotion and, from what we\u2019ve seen, audiences aren\u2019t interested in watching computer-generated content untethered from the human experience. It doesn\u2019t solve any \u2018problem\u2019 \u2014 it creates the problem of using stolen performances to put actors out of work, jeopardizing performer livelihoods and devaluing human artistry.\u201d",
      "How Has Tilly Norwood's Creator Responded to the Backlash?",
      "Van der Velden responded with a lengthy statement shared on Sept. 28 on Instagram.",

      "\"I see AI not as a replacement for people, but as a new tool \u2014 a new paintbrush,\" she continued. \"Just as animation, puppetry, or CGI opened fresh possibilities without taking away from live acting, AI offers another way to imagine and build stories. I'm an actor myself, and nothing \u2014 certainly not an AI character \u2014 can take away the craft or joy of human performance.\""

      "\"I was not expecting to see you,\" she says as he takes her headphones off. \"My bag came out first and that never happens.\"",

      "\"It truly is a miracle that anything gets made, and it\u2019s especially a miracle when something good gets made because there are so many obstacles,\" she said. \"The big thing for me is wanting the adaptations to be something that the readers would be excited about but that also can stand alone as movies. That\u2019s what everybody wants, and I do believe that they\u2019ve managed to pull that off.\"",

      "She added: \"The purpose of a happily ever after, to me, is to present the idea of hope and to present the idea that even though the world can be chaotic and scary and unpredictable, there are these things in our lives that make all of it worth it or manageable on some level, and that is love.\""

      "In \u201cNow Then,\u201d the NBC News correspondent explores the life of an 18-year-old Harvard University freshman named Lily, who was raised by a Cuban immigrant mother and Black American father.",
      "Lily finds herself surrounded by privilege at Harvard and, as she tries to find her place, she becomes drawn to a charming Indian-British student. Meanwhile, Lily\u2019s path toward self-discovery leads her to the past of her mother, who fled Cuba during the Revolution. A mystery then starts to unravel around the secrets she kept.",
      "Radford incorporated parts of her own life into \u201cNow Then\u201d through her experiences as a public high school graduate and a Harvard student from North Carolina. These aspects of her life inspired questions about access and privilege, Radford tells TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cMy father was the first in his family to go to college, his own family migrating from Jamaica and Cuba a generation prior,\u201d Radford says. \u201cMy grandfather often worked two and three jobs at the same time \u2014 working on the railroads while driving a garbage truck to support his family.",
      "\u201cThe idea that just two generations later I would have the type of exposure and adventure that my grandparents \u2014 and great-grandparents \u2014 could only dream of, set me on a path to discovery \u2014 and literary creativity! \u2014 that I am profoundly grateful for.\u201d",
      "Radford calls her creative process \u201ca labor of love and research.\u201d She says she read documents sent from relatives across three countries and interviewed family members who shared their stories, some for the first time.",
      "\u201cMy dad\u2019s family left Cuba in 1927, and they were Black immigrants. Their experience with race and belonging was incredibly textured,\u201d Radford says. \u201cExamining their history more closely gave me a nuanced appreciation for the context and environment in which they found themselves.\u201d",
      "Unpacking her family\u2019s past through a fictional story kept her focused on \u201cthe why,\u201d she says. \u201cIt allows me to lean into the meaning of an act or decision, instead of just the outcome.\u201d",

These initial two weeks following orientation were called \u201cShopping Period.\u201d We got to sample classes without commitment \u2014 no strings, no grades \u2014 just the freedom to learn.",
      "It was one of the many perks I\u2019d discovered in the crash course on privilege since I\u2019d arrived: rarely did the bounds of commitment or the burden of duty apply to this world of the elite. They always kept their freedom to choose. In fact, there seemed to be an entire series of \u201coff menu\u201d items in their universe, items that the rest of us plebeians never even knew existed.",

      "A few students were already seated as I walked inside, pulling erasers and pencil sharpeners from the deep pockets of their backpacks. I made my way toward the edge of the classroom, choosing a seat just beneath the window, the sun shining brightly through panes of scratched glass. Taking a quick look around, I felt the buzz of chatter; faces, diverse and different, filled every chair.",

      "La fen\u00eatre?",
      "Didn\u2019t that mean \u201cwindow\u201d?",
      "I looked down, suddenly feeling my cheeks get hot. I was by the window. Sure enough, before I had a chance to look up, I heard a thud.",
      "The mystery student plopped down beside me.",
      "\u201cBon,\u201d resumed Madame Carole, \u201csince we\u2019ve already welcomed our final colleague, let\u2019s begin. Please give us your name, your concentration, and one fun fact.\u201d",
      "I immediately felt nauseous: the dreaded \u201cfun fact.\u201d Why did every teacher think this exercise did anything besides make students sweat with embarrassment?",
      "I rummaged through my brain for something even slightly interesting as I listened to my classmates, eager to impress.

      "\u201cUmm, well, je suis Lily. Short for Liliana. I\u2019m from a town you\u2019ve never heard of in North Carolina. I\u2019m concentrating in Social Studies, which is just a fancy way of saying I\u2019m paying too much for a degree that my parents still refuse to tell their friends about. They think I\u2019m studying fourth grade geography.\u201d",
      "A ripple of laughter.",
      "My seatmate turned, smiling. What was that look in his eye? He leaned over.",
      "\u201cImmigrant parents?\u201d he whispered.",
      "\u201cNailed it,\u201d I answered, laughing softly.",
      "\u201cAlors!\u201d Madame said sharply, bringing the attention back to the syllabus. \u201cLet us begin, n\u2019est-ce pas?\u201d",
      "After exercises in introductory phrases and a refresher in present tense verb conjugations, a soft timer beside the professor\u2019s desk buzzed, signaling the conclusion of our first class. I gathered my backpack while the students around me thrust loose pages into overstuffed binders.",
      "Just as I was leaving, I heard a voice over my shoulder.",
      "\u201cCiao!\u201d the mystery student called, staring straight at me.",
      "\u201cOh,\u201d I mustered awkwardly, \u201cau revoir. See you soon.\u201d",
      "\u201cLooking forward to it,\u201d he said, sliding the last of his books into his brown messenger bag.",
      "I gave a crooked smile and angled my body sideways, slipping out of the narrow doors and into the sea of students making their way through Sever Hall."

It depicts the \"What's Love Got to Do with It\" singer, who died in May 2023 at age 83, performing in a mini-skirt and heels while holding a microphone.",

      "A pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood is outlined as a possibility \u2014 but not a guarantee.",
      "And hours after announcing the plan alongside Trump, Netanyahu vowed again to oppose a Palestinian state. \"Instead of Hamas isolating us, we turned the tables and isolated Hamas,\" Netanyahu said in a Hebrew video discussing his U.S. trip.",

I try to protect my soul because in this very long journey it happened many, many times that we saw this maybe a resolution to this issue.

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 He is the U.K.'s most unpopular leader on record \u2014 more disliked, polls say, than even Liz Truss, the woman famously outlasted by a lettuce.",
      "Little over a year after he won a historic landslide victory, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces what could be a make-or-break moment as he fights for his political future.",
      "The embattled leader is set to tell his restive Labour Party that it is in a \u201cfight for the soul of our country\" in an address Tuesday at its annual conference in Liverpool.",
      "Starmer, 63, faces threats from all sides.",
      "The Reform U.K. party, led by Nigel Farage, a staunch ally and friend of President Donald Trump, is leading the polls. He has capitalized on discontent over the cost of living, which has risen amid concern over immigration.",
      "It is a familiar story across Europe, where mainstream centrists such as France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron and Germany\u2019s Friedrich Merz are being outpolled by nationalists and populists on the hard right.",
      "Starmer\u2019s attempted fightback has been to reject Farage \u2014 whom he called \u201cracist\u201d this week \u2014 but also to deploy tougher talk on immigration himself.",
      "He is set to tell the party in Liverpool that it must make \u201cdecisions that will not always be comfortable for our party. Yet at the end of this hard road there will be a new country, a fairer country, a land of dignity and respect,\u201d according to a partial transcript the party released ahead of time.",
      "Starmer \"needs to stamp his authority on the party and show he has a political story to tell that they can rally round,\" said Anand Menon, director of the U.K. in a Changing Europe think tank and a professor at King's College London.",
      "Not only has that strategy so far failed to shift Starmer\u2019s dismal polling, but it has also triggered dismay from Labour\u2019s traditional left-of-center support base. It accuses him of abandoning Labour\u2019s foundational liberal values.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think he turns it around by leaning into Reform party rhetoric, which presents migrants and asylum-seekers as the fundamental problem in Britain \u2014 they\u2019re not,\u201d said Scott Lucas, a politics professor at University College Dublin.",
      "\u201cBritain\u2019s fundamental problem is economic,\u201d Lucas told NBC News. And so the question for Starmer is: \u201cCan you return to Labor\u2019s focus on public services, on competence and on finding a way forward which relies more on consensus rather than division?\u201d he added.",
      "The Labour Party did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Starmer's negative polling and the criticism of his leadership.",
      "The world\u2019s sixth-largest economy is suffering from years of sluggish growth and stubborn inflation that is forecast to be the highest this year among the G-7, a club of Western nations that includes the United States and Canada.",
      "As in the United States, that has driven up prices for everyday goods, but real wages in Britain have stagnated since the global financial crisis of 2008. Subsequent budget cuts have left public services such as the National Heath Service crumbling in the face of rising demand.",
      "During last year's election, Starmer promised the British public that he would not raise taxes on \u201cworking people\u201d \u2014 including income tax. But economic headwinds have fueled speculation that he may be forced into a U-turn in November's annual budget. Starmer has already been forced into humiliating climbdowns on pensioners' winter fuel payments and welfare reform.",
      "He has also announced the introduction of digital ID cards \u2014 an attempt to clamp down on people working illegally that has been criticized by civil liberties groups \u2014 as well as formal recognition of Palestinian statehood, which has caused friction with Trump and whose critics say is too little, too late.",
      "Though Starmer is technically safe until 2029, the scheduled date of the next election, he could come under threat before then if his party decides his leadership has become too toxic. The Labour Party conference this week has been awash with rumors that Andy Burnham, the mayor of Manchester often described in British media as \u201cthe King of the North,\u201d could mount a leadership challenge.",
      "Burnham has cooled that talk, but even so, it has been a tumultuous year for Starmer\u2019s internal operation.",
      "During the election, he ran on a platform of decency and abiding by the rules, an antithesis to the scandal-plagued ruling Conservative Party.",
      "That narrative has been weakened by a series of ministerial resignations, culminating in that of Starmer\u2019s deputy, Angela Rayner, after it was revealed she underpaid property taxes.",
      "Starmer has also carried out a radical overhaul of his internal communications team in a bid to reverse his downward fortunes. On Tuesday, his press office said his speech would mark a \u201cfork in the road\u201d for the country.",
      "\u201cThe question is, fork-in-the-road moment for what?\u201d said Lucas, of University College Dublin. \u201cThere\u2019s a fork-in-the-road moment for Labour, at least in terms of where are we going to go with the question of immigration and a proper asylum system. Can Starmer show that he still has authority within the party when you\u2019ve got a rising hard right?\u201d"

      "\u201cThe festival is the largest of its kind globally, bringing together a selection of award-winning comedy stars known for their outstanding performances on international stages and streaming platforms,\u201d the Saudi Press Agency wrote in its announcement for the General Entertainment Authority. \u201cIt reflects the efforts to amplify Riyadh\u2019s status as a leading destination for major cultural and artistic events.\u201d",
      "Saudi Arabia, the oil-rich home of Islam\u2019s two holiest sites, was for years among the most socially conservative nations on Earth with a morality police enforcing a strict interpretation of Shariah. In recent years under the rule of de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country expanded its cultural and political influence by diversifying its economy and investing in sports, entertainment and tourism to improve its global image. Along with this, the crown prince oversaw a sweeping crackdown on dissent \u2014 imprisoning disgruntled royals, women\u2019s rights advocates, and reforming clerics as well as adherents to previously government-sanctioned proponents of strict Wahhabi Islam.",

      "The nonprofit watchdog organization noted that some of the events land on the seventh anniversary of the assassination of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul by intelligence operatives with close ties to the crown prince. The festival also takes place just months after Saudi authorities executed Turki al-Jasser, a journalist known for exposing corruption within the Saudi royal family.",
      "\u201cThe seventh anniversary of Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s brutal murder is no laughing matter,\u201d Joey Shea, Saudi Arabia researcher at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. \u201cAnd comedians receiving hefty sums from Saudi authorities shouldn\u2019t be silent on prohibited topics in Saudi like human rights or free speech.\u201d",
      "Other listed performers for the festival include: Sebastian Maniscalco, Maz Jobrani, Tom Segura, Whitney Cummings, Jimeoin, Russell Peters, Andrew Santino, Bobby Lee, Chris Distefano, Mark Normand, Gabriel Iglesias, Hannibal Buress, Sam Morril, Jeff Ross, Omid Djalili, Ali Siddiq, Zarna Garg, Chris Tucker and Ben Hart.",

In the U.S., relatives of victims of the Sept. 11 terror attacks have accused the Saudi government of having potential ties to the attack. (A direct link has not been proven.)",
      "But it has also made significant inroads with some powerful figures in the West, most notably the Trump family. President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner worked with the Saudis to secure a $2 billion investment in his firm and recently partnered with the country\u2019s public investment fund to strike a $55 billion deal to take the video game giant Electronic Arts private.

      "There was a 3.3% expansion in big trees per decade, scientists found, after tracking changes in 188 intact forest plots across the Amazon over the past 30 years.",
      "Led by almost 100 researchers from 60 universities in Brazil, the U.K. and elsewhere, the findings were published Thursday in the journal Nature Plants.",
      "The authors attributed the growth to the rising amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from the burning of gas, oil and coal.",
      "The paper was welcomed as evidence of forest resilience in the face of climate change, but scientists warned these big trees remain vulnerable as droughts, lightning and fires are increasing in frequency, while deforestation continues to pose a serious threat.",
      "There was an understanding that big trees were \u201cexpected to be vulnerable to climate change,\u201d Adriane Esquivel-Muelbert, one of the study\u2019s lead authors, told NBC News in a telephone interview Saturday. \u201cWhat we see here is actually they seem to be showing quite a resilience.\u201d",

      "Scientists stressed that while protecting intact forest areas was essential to stabilizing the climate, the Amazon cannot on its own offset the vast amount of carbon dioxide produced worldwide by cars, factories and power stations \u2014 and it remains under threat.",
      "The rainforest is a carbon sink, meaning it stores more carbon than it produces. Pushing the rainforest past its limit could accelerate climate change and have terrible consequences for local communities, including Indigenous groups who depend on it.",
      "Esquivel-Muelbert stressed it was difficult to predict how worsening climate change would have an impact in the future, and hesitated to say that increased CO2 benefited the forest, warning it may cause bigger trees to become more exposed to other factors like drought.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know the consequences in the long run,\u201d she said.",
      "Other factors, including deforestation, remain a colossal risk to the health of the Amazon.",
      "Fattening trees is, in some ways, a \u201cpositive news story,\u201d said Rebecca Banbury Morgan, a lead author of the study from the University of Bristol. But it also means that the forest is now \u201cmore vulnerable to losing those trees.\u201d",
      "\u201cAlthough we have shown that trees in intact forest are still increasing in size, any benefits of this in terms of the carbon sink can be quite easily negated by deforestation and logging impacts, so preserving these intact forests is really a priority,\u201d she told NBC News.",
      "Wildfires, deforestation and global warming could permanently destroy the water cycle that sustains parts of the Amazon rainforest if action is not taken in the coming decades, according to a separate study published last year in Nature.",

During this time, all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended, and battle lines will remain frozen until conditions are met for the complete staged withdrawal.",
      "Within 72 hours of Israel publicly accepting this agreement, all hostages, alive and deceased, will be returned.",
      "Once all hostages are released, Israel will release 250 life sentence prisoners plus 1700 Gazans who were detained after October 7th 2023, including all women and children detained in that context. For every Israeli hostage whose remains are released, Israel will release the remains of 15 deceased Gazans.",
      "Once all hostages are returned, Hamas members who commit to peaceful co-existence and to decommission their weapons will be given amnesty. Members of Hamas who wish to leave Gaza will be provided safe passage to receiving countries.",
      "Upon acceptance of this agreement, full aid will be immediately sent into the Gaza Strip. At a minimum, aid quantities will be consistent with what was included in the January 19, 2025, agreement regarding humanitarian aid, including rehabilitation of infrastructure (water, electricity, sewage), rehabilitation of hospitals and bakeries, and entry of necessary equipment to remove rubble and open roads.",
      "Entry of distribution and aid in the Gaza Strip will proceed without interference from the two parties through the United Nations and its agencies, and the Red Crescent, in addition to other international institutions not associated in any manner with either party. Opening the Rafah crossing in both directions will be subject to the same mechanism implemented under the January 19, 2025 agreement.",
      "Gaza will be governed under the temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee, responsible for delivering the day-to-day running of public services and municipalities for the people in Gaza. This committee will be made up of qualified Palestinians and international experts, with oversight and supervision by a new international transitional body, the \u201cBoard of Peace,\u201d which will be headed and chaired by President Donald J. Trump, with other members and heads of State to be announced, including Former Prime Minister Tony Blair. This body will set the framework and handle the funding for the redevelopment of Gaza until such time as the Palestinian Authority has completed its reform program, as outlined in various proposals, including President Trump\u2019s peace plan in 2020 and the Saudi-French proposal, and can securely and effectively take back control of Gaza. This body will call on best international standards to create modern and efficient governance that serves the people of Gaza and is conducive to attracting investment.",
      "A Trump economic development plan to rebuild and energize Gaza will be created by convening a panel of experts who have helped birth some of the thriving modern miracle cities in the Middle East. Many thoughtful investment proposals and exciting development ideas have been crafted by well-meaning international groups, and will be considered to synthesize the security and governance frameworks to attract and facilitate these investments that will create jobs, opportunity, and hope for future Gaza.",
      "A special economic zone will be established with preferred tariff and access rates to be negotiated with participating countries.",
      "No one will be forced to leave Gaza, and those who wish to leave will be free to do so and free to return. We will encourage people to stay and offer them the opportunity to build a better Gaza.",
      "Hamas and other factions agree to not have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly, indirectly, or in any form. All military, terror, and offensive infrastructure, including tunnels and weapon production facilities, will be destroyed and not rebuilt. There will be a process of demilitarization of Gaza under the supervision of independent monitors, which will include placing weapons permanently beyond use through an agreed process of decommissioning, and supported by an internationally funded buy back and reintegration program all verified by the independent monitors. New Gaza will be fully committed to building a prosperous economy and to peaceful coexistence with their neighbors.",
      "A guarantee will be provided by regional partners to ensure that Hamas, and the factions, comply with their obligations and that New Gaza poses no threat to its neighbors or its people.",
      "The United States will work with Arab and international partners to develop a temporary International Stabilization Force (ISF) to immediately deploy in Gaza. The ISF will train and provide support to vetted Palestinian police forces in Gaza, and will consult with Jordan and Egypt who have extensive experience in this field. This force will be the long-term internal security solution. The ISF will work with Israel and Egypt to help secure border areas, along with newly trained Palestinian police forces. It is critical to prevent munitions from entering Gaza and to facilitate the rapid and secure flow of goods to rebuild and revitalize Gaza. A deconfliction mechanism will be agreed upon by the parties.",
      "Israel will not occupy or annex Gaza. As the ISF establishes control and stability, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) will withdraw based on standards, milestones, and timeframes linked to demilitarization that will be agreed upon between the IDF, ISF, the guarantors, and the Unites States, with the objective of a secure Gaza that no longer poses a threat to Israel, Egypt, or its citizens. Practically, the IDF will progressively hand over the Gaza territory it occupies to the ISF according to an agreement they will make with the transitional authority until they are withdrawn completely from Gaza, save for a security perimeter presence that will remain until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat.",
      "In the event Hamas delays or rejects this proposal, the above, including the scaled-up aid operation, will proceed in the terror-free areas handed over from the IDF to the ISF.",
      "An interfaith dialogue process will be established based on the values of tolerance and peaceful co-existence to try and change mindsets and narratives of Palestinians and Israelis by emphasizing the benefits that can be derived from peace.",
      "While Gaza re-development advances and when the PA reform program is faithfully carried out, the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognize as the aspiration of the Palestinian people.",
      "The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous co-existence."

      "Negotiations to end the fighting in Gaza were intense and productive and \u201cwould continue as long as necessary,\u201d Donald Trump said Friday night after meeting with Arab leaders in New York to discuss Israel\u2019s ongoing assault on the famine-stricken enclave.",
      "\u201cIntense negotiations have been going on for four days, and will continue for as long as necessary in order to get a Successfully Completed Agreement,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social, calling the discussions \u201cvery inspired and productive.\u201d",
      "Trump did not provide any details about the agreement being discussed, but he has previously insisted that Hamas return all of the remaining Israeli hostages kept in Gaza as part of any deal. In his post, he called for \u201cPERMANENT AND LONGLASTING PEACE!\u201d",
      "Negotiations for either a complete end to the fighting or a temporary ceasefire and hostage exchange have previously stalled as both Israel and Hamas have accused the other of reneging on promises, changing details and rejecting deals accepted by the other.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who faced a mass walkout as he spoke at the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Friday, has vowed to continue the war until all the hostages are returned and Hamas has been disarmed, and to maintain lasting security control over Gaza.",
      "After dozens of diplomats left the room, Netanyahu reiterated his intention to \u201cfinish the job\u201d against Hamas in Gaza, in a combative speech that also saw him attack the recognition of a Palestinian state by multiple Western countries.",
      "Israel and the U.S. have both said that the move risks rewarding  Hamas, which carried out the deadliest attack in Israeli history on Oct. 7, 2023, in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 hostages were taken into Gaza, according to Israel.",
      "Israel has killed more than 65,000 people in Gaza over the past 23 months, according to health officials in the enclave. It has also destroyed vast areas of the strip, displaced around 90% of the population and caused a catastrophic humanitarian crisis.",
      "Hamas has said it will only release the remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal.",
      "Trump said Friday that the militant group was \u201cvery much aware of these discussions, and Israel has been informed at all levels,\u201d including Netanyahu. \u201cThere is more Goodwill and Enthusiasm for getting a Deal done, after so many decades, than I have ever seen before,\u201d he added.",
      "Trump presented proposals to Arab nations on Monday \u2014 including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt \u2014 during a meeting held on the sidelines of the annual General Assembly, according to his special envoy Steve Witkoff.",
      "Netanyahu, meanwhile, met with the foreign minister for the United Arab Emirates in New York on Friday. Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan stressed an urgent need to end the war in Gaza and to reach a permanent and sustainable ceasefire, his office said.",
      "Bin Zayed also reiterated support for efforts to achieve a two-state solution in the region, at the same time as Israel pushes ahead with a widely condemned settlement plan that would effectively split the West Bank in two, further fracturing what Palestinians envision as their future state.",
      "UAE leaders have previously said annexation of the West Bank would be a red line for the influential Gulf state, blocking any future recognition of Israel and preventing the completion of Trump\u2019s landmark Abraham Accords that sought to establish diplomatic normalization between Israel and several Arab states including the UAE.",
      "Trump said Thursday that he would not let Israel annex the occupied West Bank. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d he told reporters.",
      "In September, Israel launched a widely condemned ground offensive into Gaza City, the enclave\u2019s most populous area, driving out hundreds of thousands of people, many of whom had previously been displaced on multiple occasions.",
      "Doctors Without Borders said Friday that it had been forced to leave the city in northern Gaza. \u201cWe have been left with no choice but to stop our activities, as our clinics are encircled by Israeli forces,\u201d it said on X.",
      "Israeli strikes and gunfire killed at least 40 people across Gaza on Saturday, including 23 from Gaza City, Dr. Khalil Al-Daqran, a spokesperson for Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health, told NBC News.",
      "The spiraling conflict in the Middle East has been a focal point of the General Assembly this week. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas addressed the gathering Thursday, albeit by video after the U.S. last month revoked his visa, along with those of other Palestinian Authority officials.",
      "Palestinians in Gaza \u201chave been facing a war of genocide, destruction, starvation and displacement\u201d by Israel, he said, adding that Palestinians rejected Hamas\u2019 terror attack on Oct. 7, 2023, and that action did not represent their people."

      "\u201cI took very crystal-clear positions in speeches that I gave in certain places in mosques, I clearly said this should not have occurred,\u201d Pezeshkian said.",
      "While this is not the first time Pezeshkian, who is considered a moderate and has criticized officials and security forces, has spoken out about the implementation of Iran\u2019s hijab laws and subsequent crackdowns, he also said the rest of the world was \u201cblowing things out of proportion.\u201d",
      "\u201cOf course, each human life is priceless,\u201d he said. But, \u201con a daily basis, hundreds of people are being killed in Lebanon, in Gaza, in all over Palestine, in Yemen and Syria, yet no one bats an eye? Why? These are less human beings?\u201d",
      "Despite Pezeshkian\u2019s moderate position on the issue of hijab, observers say he has little power to stop security forces who have used the war with Israel last June as a pretext to carry out mass arrests of ethnic and religious minorities as well as Afghan migrants, according to human rights groups.",
      "The interview was conducted with a government interpreter present and translating in real time, and NBC News reviewed the translation independently.",
      "Nuclear program",
      "Iran has renewed construction work at an underground site dug into the side of a mountain since the United States and Israel bombed the country\u2019s nuclear facilities, in a sign that Tehran is likely trying to rebuild its heavily damaged nuclear program, according to commercial satellite imagery and experts.",
      "In the three months since U.S. and Israeli warplanes struck three main nuclear facilities in Iran, satellite photos from Maxar indicate significant construction activity at Kuh-e Kolang Gaz La, or Pickaxe Mountain, which was not targeted in the air war. The site is near Natanz, a key nuclear facility that the U.S. military hammered with massive \u201cbunker buster\u201d bombs in June.",
      "The images show the construction of an elaborate security fence encircling the mountain, a concrete frame built around a tunnel entrance and a growing pile of excavated soil \u2014 suggesting continued tunneling, analysts said.",
      "The Washington Post first reported on the satellite imagery.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s clear that Iran is trying to rapidly construct a very deep underground facility just about a mile south of their uranium enrichment facility,\u201d said Joseph Rodgers, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank.",
      "\u201cThe construction has really doubled down at Pickaxe Mountain, and they\u2019ve definitely continued to drill,\u201d said Rodgers, who recently produced a report about work at the site.",
      "The White House and CIA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Llamas asked about the Washington Post report and whether the regime was building another nuclear facility. Pezeshkian said nuclear inspectors were welcome to visit his country.",
      "\u201cIf they are really telling the truth, we have been \u2026 we have come to an agreement, most recently, with the IAEA. They can come and inspect on the ground,\u201d Pezeshkian said, referring to the International Atomic Energy Agency, a watchdog body.",
      "\u201cTo put something out based on purported satellite photography, it\u2019s not pertinent in order to create frameworks that are not based in reality. In fact, would it not be easier and much more tangible and verifiable to have inspections in person on the ground?\u201d he added.",
      "The purpose of the site remains unknown. The latest satellite photos suggest Iran may be cautiously developing the location as an option for uranium enrichment or other nuclear work beyond the reach of America\u2019s powerful \u201cbunker-buster\u201d munitions, analysts said.",
      "\u201cIf they were planning on giving up their nuclear program, I don\u2019t think we would see this construction,\u201d said Jeffrey Lewis of the Center for Nonproliferation Studies. \u201cThey are going underground. Maybe they\u2019re coming to the table, but they are definitely going underground.\u201d",
      "Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in Iran, limited the scope of what Pezeshkian could accomplish during his time in New York when he said in an address on Tuesday that Iran would not talk directly to the U.S. about its nuclear program and would not negotiate on the issue of ballistic missiles or uranium enrichment.",
      "While Iran maintains that its nuclear program is peaceful, hard-line parliamentarians have called for the building of a nuclear weapon. The country now enriches uranium to near-weapons-grade levels \u2014 the only country in the world without a nuclear weapons program known to do so.",
      "Asked about the high level of enrichment, Pezeshkian said, \u201cThe religious leader of the country issued fatwa and repeated ... multiple times that it is unholy, or haram, to seek weaponization, to seek nuclear weapons, to seek any type of weapons of mass destruction. This is rooted in our ideology. It is unambiguous. And it is not changeable. So nothing has prevented us from having ... the fullest cooperation with the IAEA.\u201d",
      "On Friday, the United Nations Security Council voted against a Russian and Chinese resolution to delay reimposing sanctions, which, despite the diplomatic push from Pezeshkian and his foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, will very likely lead to penalties being reimposed after the Saturday deadline.",
      "Without a diplomatic breakthrough on the sanctions, critics will likely blast Pezeshkian for coming home empty-handed.",
      "\u201cPezeshkian\u2019s presidential campaign was premised on diplomatic engagement abroad and attempts to moderate the regime\u2019s heavy hand at home,\u201d said Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group. \u201cMore than a year into office, the limits of significant shifts within a system trapped in half-measures are clear.\u201d",
      "\u2018Set fire\u2019 to the region",
      "Before traveling to the U.S., Pezeshkian was urged by prominent intellectuals and former officials to meet with Trump directly to reduce tension and prevent another attack from the U.S. or Israel. Asked if he was concerned about more war coming to Iran and an expected meeting between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Pezeshkian struck a defiant tone.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not afraid of war. We do not seek war,\u201d he said. \u201cPresident Trump has said that his administration has come to create peace, but the path that they have embarked upon will set fire to the entire region.\u201d",
      "He went on to say that while Iran has \u201cnever started a war. We  will never be starting any wars.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut whomever attacks us, we will do our utmost to give them the strongest answer. We will certainly augment our capabilities on a daily basis so as to prevent anyone from attacking us,\u201d Pezeshkian added.",
      "Injury during an airstrike",
      "Pezeshkian, who practiced as a doctor before entering politics, addressed an injury he sustained during the 12-day war with Israel in June, during which senior military leaders, scientists and hundreds of Iranian civilians were killed. Twenty-eight Israelis died during the conflict.",
      "\u201cThey hit us because they were seeking to martyr us like everyone else. We are not afraid of death and martyrdom. We have lived our lives. I have lived my life,\u201d he said.",
      "As for his wounded leg, Pezeshkian said, \u201cit wasn\u2019t anything special.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe can just say that it was a hematoma formed in the region of the knee. We dropped the needed liquid and blood, and after that, we got over it,\u201d he added."

      "Two people died in Cuba due to Imelda, which earlier affected the eastern part of the island nation, Cuban Prime Minister Manuel Marrero said late Monday. Marrero said on X that the two people died in Santiago de Cuba province, but he didn\u2019t give any details.",

      "Inoperable weapons that can be modified or amended to be made operable are illegal to possess under New Zealand law. An additional permit, beyond a regular gun license, is required to possess a pistol.",

      "An inquiry into the attacks found that the attacker had been able to amass a trove of semiautomatic weapons, with authorities failing to enforce proper checks on firearms licenses. The sale of all types of semiautomatic weapons and assault rifles was subsequently banned.",
      "Violent gun crime and gun ownership in urban areas across New Zealand is rare, with possession largely limited to those in rural areas for hunting and pest control purposes or among law enforcement, according to John Battersby, a senior fellow at the Centre for Defence and Security Studies at the country's Massey University.",
      "While New Zealand's police are trained to use firearms and do have access to them, they often leave their weapons locked in their vehicles, he told NBC News in a telephone interview on Tuesday.",

      "The United States was set to deport hundreds of Iranian nationals, a senior official in Tehran said Tuesday, as the Trump administration takes new steps in its immigration crackdown.",
      "U.S. authorities had \u201cplanned to deport about 400 Iranians currently living in the United States, most of whom entered illegally,\u201d the Iranian Foreign Affairs Ministry\u2019s director general for parliamentary affairs, Hossein Noushabadi, told the semiofficial Tasnim news agency.",
      "\u201cOut of this number 120 have been selected for deportation and will return to Iran within the next one or two days,\u201d he added, attributing the deportation to the United States\u2019 \u201cnew anti-immigration policy.\u201d",
      "The identities of the Iranians and their reasons for trying to immigrate to the United States were not immediately clear. The United States has not acknowledged any deal, and the State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said that \u201cthe Trump Administration is committed to fulfilling President Trump\u2019s promise to carry out the largest mass deportation operation of illegal aliens in history, using all the tools at our disposal.\u201d",
      "The New York Times first reported the news.",
      "The planned deportations mark a rare instance of cooperation between the United States and Iran, which faced new criticism this week for its human rights record as it cracks down after a wave of protests and conflict with Israel.",
      "United Nations human rights experts said Monday they were appalled by a \u201cdramatic escalation\u201d in the number of executions in Iran after more than 1,000 people were killed in the first nine months of 2025.",
      "President Donald Trump came into office promising the largest mass deportation in U.S history, targeting the more than 10 million unauthorized migrants living in the United States.",
      "However, his administration has struggled to increase deportation levels despite pursuing deals with a number of countries.",
      "One hundred nineteen people of different nationalities were deported to Panama in February as part of an agreement with the Trump administration.",
      "The administration has also worked to send immigrants to third countries, or places they do not hail from and may never have been, to increase deportation numbers. That has resulted in a high-profile dispute over groups of Venezuelans sent to a mega-prison in El Salvador. In July, eight men from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar and Vietnam were also sent from the United States to South Sudan, and five immigrant detainees were sent to the small African nation of Eswatini.",

      "It is not clear what, if anything, the United States is providing in exchange for the release of its nationals by the Taliban, who have been diplomatically isolated since they returned to power in 2021. The hard-line Islamist regime has been especially criticized for its treatment of women, and it had not been recognized by any foreign government until Russia became the first in July.",
      "Afghanistan, a country of more than 40 million people, has been battered by a series of economic and humanitarian crises, including a 6.0-magnitude earthquake last month that killed more than 2,000 people, and it is seeking investment in addition to diplomatic recognition.",
      "Trump also said this month that he wanted the United States to retake Bagram Air Base, a sprawling facility north of Afghanistan\u2019s capital, Kabul, that for almost 20 years was a crucial hub in the war against the Taliban and Al Qaeda. He has continued to push for it even after the Taliban rejected the idea, saying \u201cbad things\u201d will happen unless the base is returned to U.S. control."

      "NEW YORK \u2014 The United States clashed with world leaders over artificial intelligence at the United Nations General Assembly this week, rejecting calls for global oversight as many pushed for new collaborative frameworks.",
      "While many heads of state, corporate leaders and prominent figures endorsed a need for urgent international collaboration on AI, the U.S. delegation criticized the role of the U.N. and pushed back on the idea of centralized governance of AI.",
      "Representing the U.S. in Wednesday\u2019s Security Council meeting on AI, Michael Kratsios, the director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, said, \u201cWe totally reject all efforts by international bodies to assert centralized control and global governance of AI.\u201d",
      "The path to a flourishing future powered by AI does not lie in \u201cbureaucratic management,\u201d Kratsios said, but instead in \u201cthe independence and sovereignty of nations.\u201d",
      "While Kratsios shot down the idea of combined AI governance, President Donald Trump said in his speech to the General Assembly on Tuesday that the White House will be \u201cpioneering an AI verification system that everyone can trust\u201d to enforce the Biological Weapons Convention.",
      "\u201cHopefully, the U.N. can play a constructive role, and it will also be one of the early projects under AI,\u201d Trump said. AI \u201ccould be one of the great things ever, but it also can be dangerous, but it can be put to tremendous use and tremendous good.\u201d",
      "In a statement to NBC News, a State Department spokesperson said, \u201cThe United States supports like-minded nations working together to encourage the development of AI in line with our shared values. The US position in international bodies is to vigorously advocate for international AI governance approaches that promote innovation, reflect American values, and counter authoritarian influence.\u201d",
      "The comments rejecting collaborative efforts around AI governance stood in stark contrast to many of the initiatives being launched at the General Assembly.",
      "On Thursday, the U.N. introduced the Global Dialogue on AI Governance, the U.N.\u2019s first body dedicated to AI governance involving all member states. U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said the body would \u201clay the cornerstones of a global AI ecosystem that can keep pace with the fastest-moving technology in human history.\u201d Speaking after Guterres, Nobel Prize recipient Daron Acemoglu outlined the growing stakes of AI\u2019s rapid development, arguing that \u201cAI is the biggest threat that humanity has faced.\u201d",
      "But in an interview with NBC News, Amandeep Singh Gill, the U.N.\u2019s special envoy for digital and emerging technologies, said that the United States\u2019 critical perception of the U.N.\u2019s role in international AI governance was misconstrued.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a misrepresentation to say that the U.N. is somehow getting into the regulation of AI,\u201d Gill said. \u201cThese are not top-down power grabs in terms of regulation. The regulation stays where regulation can be done in sovereign jurisdictions.\u201d",
      "Instead, the U.N.\u2019s mechanisms \u201cwill provide platforms for international cooperation on AI governance,\u201d Gill said.",
      "In remarks immediately following Kratsios\u2019 comments, China\u2019s Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ma Zhaoxu said, \u201cIt is vital to jointly foster an open, inclusive, fair and nondiscriminatory environment for technological development and firmly oppose unilateralism and protectionism.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe support the U.N. playing a central role in AI governance,\u201d Ma said.",
      "One day after Kratsios\u2019 remarks at the Security Council, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez seemed to push back on Kratsios and gave full-throated support for international cooperation on AI and the U.N.\u2019s role in AI governance.",
      "\u201cWe need to coordinate a shared vision of AI at a global level, with the U.N. as the legitimate and inclusive forum to forge consensus around common interests,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said. \u201cThe time is now, when multilateralism is being most questioned and attacked, that we need to reaffirm how suitable it is in addressing challenges such as those represented by AI.\u201d",
      "Reacting to the week\u2019s developments, Renan Araujo, director of programs for the Washington, D.C.-based Institute for AI Policy and Strategy, told NBC News that \u201cno one wants to see a burdensome, bureaucratic governance structure, and the U.S. has succeeded in starting bilateral and minilateral coalitions. At the same time, we should expect AI-related challenges to become more transnational in nature as AI capabilities become more advanced.\u201d",
      "This is not the first time the U.N. has addressed AI, having passed the Global Digital Compact last year. The compact laid the foundation for the AI dialogue and for an independent international scientific panel to evaluate AI\u2019s abilities, risks and pathways forward. Guterres announced that nominations to this panel are now open.",
      "While Thursday\u2019s event marked the launch of the global dialogue and panel, the dialogue will have its first full meeting in Geneva in summer 2026, in tandem with the International Telecommunication Union\u2019s annual AI for Good summit. The dialogue\u2019s exact functions and first actions will be charted out over the coming months."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday handed another win to the Trump administration by allowing it to withhold $4 billion in spending on foreign aid that was appropriated by Congress.",
      "A federal judge had ruled that the administration would have to spend the funds by the end of the month, but the Supreme Court's decision puts that on hold.",
      "\u201cThis result further erodes separation of powers principles that are fundamental to our constitutional order. It will also have a grave humanitarian impact,\" said Nicolas Sansome, a lawyer with Public Citizen Litigation Group, which represents nonprofit groups that sued.",
      "The brief order noted that the government has made a \"sufficient showing\" that the groups that sued were barred from bringing the lawsuit in question under a law called the Impoundment Control Act.",
      "The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, also noted that \"the asserted harms to the Executive\u2019s conduct of foreign affairs appear to outweigh the potential harm\" to the plaintiffs, which are various groups that receive foreign aid funds.",
      "The court has now granted 20 emergency applications filed by the administration since President Donald Trump\u2019s second term began in January. The volume of emergency filings and the rate at which the court has ruled in the administration's favor are both unprecedented. The latter has sparked criticism from within the legal community, including lower court judges.",
      "A Justice Department spokesman did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.",
      "The three liberals on the court dissented, with Justice Elena Kagan writing that the legal issue in the case has not been presented before, meaning the court was working in \"uncharted territory.\"",
      "Yet again, the majority nevertheless granted the emergency request made by the government without hearing oral arguments or issuing a fully reasoned decision, she added.",
      "\"We therefore should have denied this application, allowed the lower courts to go forward, and ensured that the weighty question presented here receives the consideration it deserves,\" Kagan wrote.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts had on Sept. 9 issued a temporary stay that put the lower court ruling on hold while the Supreme Court decided what next steps to take.",
      "The Trump administration, which has aggressively sought to exert its power over Congress in recent months, has notified lawmakers of its intention not to spend the funds.",
      "This action has sparked a debate over whether the president has such authority, as under the Constitution, it is the role of Congress to allocate money for the president to spend.",
      "After the Supreme Court decision, Democrats quickly urged Congress to reassert its authority to control spending even as lawmakers are engaged in a budget fight that could lead to a government shutdown.",
      "\"Republicans should join Democrats to stand up for our power of the purse,\" Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wa. and Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn. said in a joint statement.",
      "The Trump administration has already taken swift action to unravel the U.S. Agency for International Development, the government department that traditionally handed out billions of dollars a year in foreign aid to tackle such issues as access to water and disease prevention.",
      "The money at issue was appropriated by Congress for the current fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30. The Trump administration has said it wants to withhold $4 billion in foreign aid, but will spend another $6.5 billion that Congress appropriated.",
      "The Impoundment Control Act was passed in 1974 to regulate the president\u2019s control over the budget. That followed efforts by then-President Richard Nixon to withhold spending on programs he did not support.",
      "The Trump administration says it can withhold the money via a process known as \"rescission,\" in which the president informs Congress of his intention not to spend certain funds.",
      "But with little time left before the funds expire, Congress is unlikely to respond, even if it wanted to. Republicans who broadly support Trump's policies control both chambers and are in the process of trying to fund the government for the next fiscal year before Oct. 1; otherwise, the government will shut down.",
      "The administration's decision to wait until the end of the fiscal year to notify Congress is a legally questionable tactic that has been called a \"pocket rescission\" and has not been used in nearly 50 years.",
      "Washington-based U.S. District Judge Amir Ali had ruled on Sept. 3 that the administration must spend the money unless Congress acts to withdraw it.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer said in a court filing that Ali's ruling imposed unacceptable restrictions on the president by, among other things, forcing the administration to engage in diplomatic discussions with other countries over how to spend the money",
      "The underlying lawsuit challenging Trump's rescission was brought by various groups led by the Global Health Council.",
      "Their lawyers said in court papers that the administration's legal arguments would turn the Impoundment Control Act on its head by reaching the conclusion that \"Congress\u2019s signature law meant to control impoundments actually provided the President vast new powers to impound funds, and made it virtually impossible to challenge impoundments in court.\""

      "Black liberation activist and American fugitive Assata Shakur, who escaped to Cuba more than 45 years ago after she was convicted of killing a New Jersey state trooper, died in Havana, the government announced Friday.",
      "She was 78.",
      "Shakur, who changed her name from Joanne Chesimard, died Thursday from health ailments and advanced age, according to a short statement released by the Cuban Foreign Ministry.",
      "\u201cWords cannot describe the depth of loss that I am feeling at this time. I want to thank you for your loving prayers,\u201d her daughter Kakuya Shakur wrote in a Facebook post.",
      "Shakur was involved in a shootout during a traffic stop on the New Jersey Turnpike in 1973. State Trooper Werner Foerster, the second officer responding to the scene, found a loaded gun on the driver of the car, according to previous NBC News reporting. Shakur was in the front passenger seat and another man was seated behind her.",
      "There was an exchange of gunfire. James Harper, the state trooper who initially pulled the group over, said he saw Shakur shoot Foerster in the stomach with the officer's gun after he tussled with the driver, who also shot Foerster in the arm.",
      "Shakur and two men she was with returned to the car and drove five miles down the New Jersey Turnpike. One of the men with them, James Coston, died in the car. As they dumped Coston's body on the side of the road, police caught up to the group. Shakur was arrested while the driver fled and was found nearly two days later.",
      "Shakur, who was sentenced to life in prison, denied shooting Foerster. To supporters, she was an activist jailed for crimes she did not commit.",
      "In a statement, Foerster's family said her death did not bring any joy to them, but did bring \"a measure of closure to a tragedy that has deeply affected our family and community.\"",
      "\"While this development marks the end of a long and painful chapter, it does not erase the profound loss we continue to feel each day,\" the family said. \"The pain of losing Werner is something we carry every single day. His absence is felt in every quiet moment, every family gathering, and every milestone he should have been here to witness.\"",
      "Shakur was born Joanne Deborah Byron in Queens, New York, on July 16, 1947. After what she described in her autobiography as a troubled childhood, she became involved in political activism at the Borough of Manhattan Community College and City College of New York. She was a member of the revolutionary Black Liberation Army, as well as the Black Panther Party. At 21, she married Louis Chesimard, though their marriage lasted only a year.",
      "Shakur was serving a life sentence at the Clinton Correctional Facility for Women in New Jersey after being convicted in 1977 of murder in Foerster's death. She had also been implicated in armed robbery and other crimes. She escaped from prison on Nov. 2, 1979, with the help of members of the Black Liberation Army who posed as visitors. She turned up a few years later in Cuba, where the island\u2019s leader at the time, Fidel Castro, granted her political asylum. She published an autobiography in 1987.",
      "Because Cuba repeatedly refused to extradite her to the U.S., Shakur and other fugitives living in Cuba became a major sticking point in negotiations between the U.S. and the communist-run island after President Barack Obama re-established diplomatic relations between the two countries.",
      "Then-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Shakur should be returned to New Jersey after the ceremonial reopening of the U.S. Embassy in Cuba in 2015.",
      "Gov. Phil Murphy and state Police Superintendent Col. Patrick Callahan said in a statement Friday that their offices have worked with the State Department in previous attempts to bring Shakur back to New Jersey to face accountability for Foerster's killing and for fleeing the country.",
      "\"We will vigorously oppose any attempt to repatriate Chesimard's remains to the United States,\" they wrote.",
      "Shakur became the first woman on the FBI\u2019s list of most wanted terrorists in 2013. She was added to the list on the anniversary of Foerster\u2019s death. There was a $2 million reward for information leading to her arrest.",
      "Supporters of Shakur, who was rapper Tupac Shakur's godmother through her brother Mutulu Shakur, believed she was a target of law enforcement for her involvement with the Black Liberation Army.",
      "In a 1998 interview with NBC New York in Havana, Shakur said she had never killed anyone and was found guilty in an \u201cunfair trial\u201d by an all-white jury.",
      "\u201cI was shot with my arms in the air, then shot again in the back and left on the ground to die,\u201d she said. \u201cNext thing I knew, they were coming by me and saying, \u2018Is she dead yet, is she dead yet?\u2019\u201d",
      "She said she was later taken to a hospital, where she was beaten and tortured by state troopers who she said would stick their hands in her wounds and ask if it hurt.",
      "\u201cAmerican racism has done to another Black person what it has done to Black people down through the years,\u201d Shakur\u2019s defense attorney William Kunstler said in 1977. \u201cThe reality is, this beautiful young Black woman never had a chance, but we, like liberal fools, still had hopes.\u201d"
