      "Eric Puchner is a well-regarded fiction writer whose new novel, \u201cDream State,\u201d tells a story about life\u2019s unexpected and improbable plot twists",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Eric Puchner is a well-regarded fiction writer whose new novel, \u201cDream State,\u201d tells a story about life's unexpected and improbable twists.",
      "Weeks before the book's release, Puchner himself received some very surprising news, from Oprah Winfrey, who told him that she had chosen \u201cDream State\u201d for her book club.",
      "\u201cI got a phone call from a number I didn't recognize,\" the author said during a recent interview. \u201cWhen the caller said she was Oprah Winfrey I nearly dropped the phone I was so baffled. I was expecting to talk to my publicist, and at first, I didn't believe her. But then she started to talk in that inimitable way.\u201d",
      "The 54-year-old author is an associate professor at Johns Hopkins University who hopes the Winfrey endorsement might mark a shift from years \u201ctoiling in obscurity,\u201d wishing only that he could attract enough readers to keep writing. \u201cDream State\u201d is the fourth book from Puchner, whose previous works include the story collections \u201cMusic Through the Floor\u201d and \u201cLast Day on Earth\u201d and the novel \u201cModel Home,\u201d a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award in 2011.",
      "Puchner's latest work, published Tuesday, is a love triangle among two old college friends and the woman they both have wished to marry. Set mostly in Montana and California, the 432-page narrative extends half a century from his characters' early years to approaching old age as all contend with their feelings for each other and how they imagine they might otherwise have turned out.",
      "\u201cThis is the kind of book you won\u2019t want to put down written by a brilliant storyteller,\u201d Winfrey said in a statement. \u201cSpanning fifty years, \u2018Dream State\u2019 is an exquisite examination of the important relationships we have in our lives \u2014 love, marriage, friendship \u2014 and how life can turn out so differently than we expected.\u201d",
      "Puchner is a Baltimore resident who says the book was inspired in part by a disastrous wedding he once attended that he re-imagined for \u201cDream State\u201d and by a house in Montana that he and his wife and two children stay at in the summer. The book touches upon the damages caused by climate change that he has witnessed over the years in Montana, whether drought or hotter temperatures.",
      "\u201cI know that I wanted to write about this place that I love and what was happening to it,\u201d he says.",
      "Winfrey established her book club in 1996 and currently presents it in partnership with Starbucks. Her conversation with Puchner took place in a Starbucks in the Empire State Building and the video podcast can be seen on Winfrey's YouTube channel."

      "The trial of the only suspect ever charged in the 1996 killing of rap icon Tupac Shakur has been postponed",
      "LAS VEGAS -- A Nevada judge on Tuesday postponed the murder trial of the only suspect ever charged in the 1996 killing of rap icon Tupac Shakur for nearly a year, saying she had little choice given new developments presented by his defense attorneys and the need to ensure a fair trial.",
      "The trial of Duane \u201cKeffe D\u201d Davis, previously set for next month in Las Vegas, has been rescheduled for Feb. 9, 2026. The judge ordered prosecutors and the defense to return to court over the summer for a status hearing.",
      "\u201cIt looks like there are quite a few things that are left to be done to get this case prepared so that Mr. Davis can have effective assistance of counsel,\u201d Clark County District Court Judge Carli Kierny said during a short hearing.",
      "When asked by the judge if he was OK with moving the trial that far out, Davis agreed.",
      "Davis' defense team filed a motion Friday seeking more time, saying critical investigative work had to be done and witnesses needed to be interviewed to ensure he gets a fair trial. The lawyers said a private investigator identified witnesses who can testify that Davis was not at the scene of the shooting.",
      "Attorney Carl Arnold, who is leading the defense, said the case involves decades-old allegations and critical facts have yet to be fully examined.",
      "On the night of Sept. 7, 1996, Shakur was in a BMW being driven by Death Row Records founder Marion \u201cSuge\u201d Knight. They were waiting at a red light when a white Cadillac pulled up next to them and gunfire erupted.",
      "Davis, an ex-gang leader who is accused of orchestrating Shakur\u2019s killing near the Las Vegas Strip, has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and has been jailed since his September 2023 arrest.",
      "Davis has acknowledged in interviews and in his tell-all memoir that he provided the gun used in the drive-by shooting and that he was in the car. But his court filings say his descriptions in recent years of orchestrating the shooting were \u201cdone for entertainment purposes and to make money.\u201d",
      "Arnold has argued that Davis never should have been charged because of immunity agreements that Davis says he reached years ago with federal and local prosecutors while living in California.",
      "Prosecutors disagree, saying they have strong evidence against Davis and any immunity agreement was limited.",
      "Defense attorneys also are raising questions about the manner of Shakur's death, saying they have witness information indicating that he was in stable condition after the shooting and died suddenly after being hospitalized for a week. They want to consult medical and forensic experts to evaluate potential alternative causes of death."

      "Sotheby\u2019s auction house said Tuesday that \u201cCrude Oil (Vettriano)\u201d is being sold in London next month from the collection of Mark Hoppus, bassist with California skate-punk band Blink-182, who sees Banksy as a kindred spirit.",
      "Hoppus said he was drawn to the subversion, humor and intelligence of Banksy\u2019s work and the similarities between \u201cskateboarding, punk rock and art.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel like street art and punk rock have the same core,\u201d Hoppus said. \u201cThe left-out and overlooked making their own reality. \u2026 Just go make art. It\u2019s the same spirit. And I\u2019ve loved art and especially street art ever since realizing that.\u201d",
      "\u201cCrude Oil (Vettriano)\u201d is part of a 2005 series of works in which Banksy put a satirical spin on famous paintings \u2014 withering Vincent van Gogh\u2019s \u201cSunflowers\u201d and smashing the diner window in Edward Hopper\u2019s \u201cNighthawks.\u201d The artist said his aim was to show that \u201cthe real damage done to our environment is not done by graffiti writers and drunken teenagers, but by big business.\u201d",
      "The work going under the hammer is based on \u201cThe Singing Butler,\u201d a painting by Scottish artist Jack Vettriano showing a couple in evening dress dancing on a beach as servants proffer sheltering umbrellas. Banksy has added a sinking oil liner and two figures lugging a barrel of toxic waste.",
      "\u201cWe loved this painting since the moment we saw it,\u201d said Hoppus, who bought the artwork with his wife Skye in 2011. He said the painting \u2013 \u201cunmistakably Banksy, but different\u201d \u2013 has hung in the family\u2019s homes in London and LA ever since.",
      "Hoppus said he would use the proceeds of the sale to buy work by upcoming artists. Some will go to the California Fire Foundation, Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles and Cedars Sinai Hematology Oncology Research,",
      "Banksy, who has never confirmed his full identity, began his career spray-painting buildings in Bristol, England, and has become one of the world\u2019s best-known artists. His mischievous and often satirical images include two male police officers kissing, armed riot police with yellow smiley faces and a chimpanzee with a sign bearing the words, \u201cLaugh now, but one day I\u2019ll be in charge.\u201d",
      "Several of his works have sold for multiple millions at auction. The record is almost 18.6 million pounds ($25.4 million at the time) paid at Sotheby\u2019s in October 2021 for \u201cLove is in the Bin\u201d \u2013 an image of a girl with a balloon that partially self-destructed during an auction three years earlier thanks to a shredder hidden in the frame.",
      "The painting is on display at Sotheby\u2019s in New York until Thursday and in London Feb. 26-March 4."

He\u2019s just the hired muscle, quietly observing and reacting to the quickly devolving situation around him. And yet you can\u2019t take your eyes off of this stranger.",
      "Up until that point it\u2019s been the Mikey Madison show, a chronicle of her character Ani\u2019s whirlwind romance with the spendy, wild son of a Russian oligarch. Igor arrives at the turning point, the end of the honeymoon and the beginning of a swift descent into a chaotic, all-night manhunt. And soon he establishes himself not just as an intriguing outsider, but the soul of the film: The henchman with a heart.",
      "It\u2019s a performance that has caught many off guard: An introduction to a fresh face with an undeniable star quality that has earned him nominations from the Oscars, the Screen Actors Guild and the BAFTAs. But Borisov, 32, is only a newcomer in some parts of the world. Already a star in Russia, Borisov broke through on the international scene in the Cannes title \u201cCompartment No. 6\u201d as the uncouth miner sharing a cramped room with a Finnish student on a long train ride through Russia.",
      "That was the performance that made filmmaker Sean Baker take note and give him a call about participating in what would become \u201cAnora.\u201d Baker has described his secret weapon, who quickly becomes the beating heart and soul of the film, as the \u201cRussian Ryan Gosling.\" Borisov is flattered, but also little confused by the comparison.",

      "Baker, for his part, knew he had a ringer in Borisov but doesn\u2019t show his hand from the top. He strings the audience along, letting them feel like they\u2019re discovering something too. The 28-minute real-time home invasion scene where we meet Igor was actually Borisov\u2019s first to film. It was rehearsed and discussed in detail before the cameras started rolling. In all, it took about eight days to film and three months to edit.",
      "\u201cWe discussed everything trying to find the balance humor and scares and drama and comedy because it\u2019s important for this scene to,\" Borisov said. \u201cBut for me I\u2019m just thinking about a real person named Igor and a real person named Anora.\u201d",
      "He and Baker spoke a lot about Igor\u2019s past, his story, his dreams and his clothes. The white Nike sneakers as contrast to Igor\u2019s all black outfit, he thought, were particularly poignant \u2014 a symbol of Igor\u2019s soul. He liked that his director would ask him if he thought Igor might do this or that instead of just telling him to do something.",
      "But Borisov is not the kind of actor who thinks that he has much interesting to say or explain about his performance. If he could, he said, he\u2019d be a writer. For him, it\u2019s the work that does the talking.",
      "\u201cThe most important is what do you feel when you see the film,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not so important what we were discussing.\u201d",
      "The week that Borisov spoke to the AP was the week \u201cAnora\u201d had emerged as the frontrunner in an awards race that had previously been wide open. The supporting actor category however, competitive as it may be with nominees like Edward Norton, Guy Pearce and Jeremy Strong, has been considered Kieran Culkin\u2019s to lose for some time now. But it\u2019s still significant: Borisov is the first Russian actor to get an Oscar nomination since Mikhail Baryshnikov\u2019s nod in 1977 for \u201cThe Turning Point.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy that it means something for a lot of people and that\u2019s why it means a lot for me,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople could feel some hope maybe inside them, maybe proud inside them, you know? \u201c",
      "It\u2019s been a wild ride since Cannes and the end is now in sight. Soon he\u2019d be leaving for London, to attend the BAFTAs, and in two weeks Los Angeles for the Oscars. The accolades and nominations have been exciting, though the impulse to keep the conversations going with all the interesting people he\u2019s met along the way has led to more than few late nights.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a crazy, crazy time,\u201d he said.",

Because without this stuff, we will go to live our life separately. And it will be one day, of course, and I\u2019m kind of sad about this but it just will come.

Or Ryan Gosling\u2019s wink at Emma Stone last year that had internet shippers in a tizzy?",
      "The worst part is that for some parts of the world, including the U.S., they\u2019re also not the easiest to watch \u2014 or at least a little harder than just turning on ABC (and soon Hulu) to watch the Oscars.",
      "The Associated Press is here to help those without a BritBox subscription with a rundown of the best and most memorable moments of the night, where \u201cAnora\u201d did not sweep (though Mikey Madison did triumph over best actress front-runner Demi Moore), \u201cConclave\u201d won big and \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d proved it\u2019s still a contender.",
      "Host David Tennant got the ceremony off to an amusing start with a pre-recorded bit where various actors give him a little pep talk, appearing in his dressing room mirror \u2014 including fellow Scot Brian Cox, who kicked off a rousing rendition of The Proclaimers song \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Be (500 Miles).\u201d Tennant took over and brought the anthem into the room, where Selena Gomez seemed genuinely surprised when he tapped her shoulder and inserted her name into the song. There were the celebrity participants of course, James McAvoy, Camila Cabello and Colman Domingo among them. But even some not \u201cin the show\u201d sang along happily as well, Saoirse Ronan and Jack Lowden included. Others, like Adrien Brody and Demi Moore, did not seem to be part of the chorus.",
      "No presenter wants a John Travolta \u201cAdele Dazeem\u201d moment or, worse, a Faye Dunaway \u201cLa La Land\u201d flap, and you could see the wheels turning in Gomez\u2019s head as she looked at the card for the debut by a British writer, director or producer award. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to say,\u201d she said quietly from stage, looking at her co-star and co-presenter, Zoe Salda\u00f1a, before looking further down on the card. \u201cOh, \u2018Kneecap,\u2019\u201d she said, quietly adding, \u201cRich\u201d and simply avoiding the writer-director\u2019s last name, Peppiatt.",
      "Jesse Eisenberg started off his best screenplay win for \u201cA Real Pain\u201d with some signature, self-deprecating jokes about how neither he, his wife nor the person who sat him thought he was going to win. The audience laughed loudly when he said that\u2019s why his wife didn\u2019t attend the ceremony. But he quickly turned sincere, offering a touching tribute to his wife, Anna Strout, whom he credited with helping him learn about the world around him. \u201cYou\u2019ve put every worthwhile thought into my head over the last 20 years,\u201d Eisenberg said. \u201cI love you so much.\u201d",
      "Perhaps Salda\u00f1a was feeling the pressure of \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u2019s\u201d diminished Oscar dreams two days before voting closes. Or maybe she was just really overwhelmed to win the best supporting actress BAFTA. Regardless, she let her emotions show in a teary and intense speech, in which she poked fun at her own inability to do a good British accent, shouted out her makeup artist as her closest confidant and made a case for the film.",
      "\u201cFilms are supposed to change hearts and challenge minds, and I hope, I hope that \u2018Emilia P\u00e9rez\u2019 did something like this,\u201d she said. \u201cVoices need to be heard, just not my English accent. Bye, guys.\u201d",
      "In memoriam segments don\u2019t need to be flashy. All you need is a thoughtful reel, Jeff Goldblum and a piano, it turns out. He played \u201cAs Time Goes By.\u201d",
      "Warwick Davis joked that he\u2019d keep his BAFTA Fellowship acceptance speech \u201cshort,\u201d telling the audience that it\u2019s OK, they can laugh. \u201cThis is probably the best thing that has ever happened to me, and I\u2019ve been in \u2018Star Wars,\u2019\u201d he said. Davis also got emotional, speaking about his wife who died last year.",
      "\u201cShe was always so supportive of my career, encouraging me to grab every opportunity with both hands,\u201d he said. \u201cSince then, life has been pretty tough for me. Thanks to the support of our wonderful children, I\u2019ve been able to continue working and engaging in life.\u201d",

      "Gordon could inspired have Cruise's Cole Trickle back in the day, though the character was loosely based on the late Tim Richmond. Gordon, now vice chairman at Hendrick Motorsports, won the Daytona 500 on Sunday with team owner Rick Hendrick and driver William Byron. Gordon and Cruise have remained friendly \u2014 Cruise showed up at a 2015 NASCAR banquet to honor the retiring Gordon \u2014 which could boost the prospect of Gordon and Hendrick Motorsports' involvement in a sequel.",
      "\"He seems to like to tease it, so I don\u2019t know,\" Gordon said Sunday night. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens. If that doesn\u2019t happen, I feel pretty confident there\u2019s a project out there that will get NASCAR back on the big screen, if not just a really cool docuseries or something beyond even what we\u2019re already seeing right now.\u201d",
      "The movie ultimately introduced NASCAR to a wider audience that had very limited exposure to stock-car racing before that summer. There had been racing movies before \u2014 think \u201cThunder Road,\u201d \u201cGrand Prix,\u201d \u201cStroker Ace,\u201d or even \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d \u2014 but none that had depicted NASCAR in such a mainstream style.",
      "\u201cHard to imagine how you pull that off today because they actually had race cars with cameras in the race, and the cameras were big,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cCameras have gotten a lot smaller so maybe you could pull it off, but how do you do it and make it realistic and really authentic?\u201d",
      "NASCAR has seen more swings and misses than checkered flags when it comes to its portrayal on the big or small screen since \u201cDays of Thunder.\u201d For every \u201cTalladega Nights,\u201d there are 10 more bombs such as comedian Kevin James' ill-fated Netflix\u2019s comedy series, \u201c The Crew.\" Gordon said he was encouraged that better days are ahead for NASCAR in the entertainment industry.",
      "\u201cI am seeing just a lot more momentum in projects like coming through NASCAR and coming to Hendrick Motorsports and just more interest,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s good, right? It talks a lot about where the sport is at, where it\u2019s heading, the amazing crowd that was here all weekend, not just today, new TV partners.\u201d",

      "P-Lo played a key role in bringing together the Bay Area\u2019s top artists, contributing to all nine tracks on the album. He began the process late last summer, collaborating with local talent to craft a well-rounded project.",
      "\u201cP-Lo can produce, rap and bring all these artists who are like family to him,\u201d said David Kelly, an executive with the Warriors. He spearheaded the launch of Golden State Entertainment in 2022 before the team won the championship that year.",
      "Several NBA teams have partnered with artists over the years: Drake as the Toronto Raptors\u2019 global ambassador, Jay-Z as a former minority owner of the Brooklyn Nets, and the Miami Heat collaborating with DJ Khaled, who performed at games. The Atlanta Hawks have also embraced their city\u2019s rap scene, working with T.I., 2 Chainz, and Quavo.",
      "But an NBA team with its own record label and entertainment division? That\u2019s where Kelly saw an opportunity for the Warriors to break new ground. He said creating a label, intersecting hip-hop and basketball made sense.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just kind of authentic and natural to the culture,\u201d said Kelly, who joined the organization in 2011 and currently is the chief business officer of Golden State Entertainment. \u201cIt seems like a lot of times people try to force them apart or mesh them together that don\u2019t make sense. But if you grew up a part of both, they naturally intertwine.\u201d",
      "Kelly first pitched the idea of the Warriors having a record label to then-president Rick Welts before bringing it to the team\u2019s owner, Joe Lacob, and co-executive chairman Peter Guber. He said the Warriors' leadership embraced his vision, and he hopes more pro teams will follow suit.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s seeing the culture being presented in a way that\u2019s true and reflective on a grand international scale,\u201d said Kelly, a former Chicago-based rapper, whose stage name was Capital D. \u201cHopefully this is the first of many for Golden State and the culture.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Lawyers will give their closing arguments at the trial of rapper A$AP Rocky, who is accused of two felony counts of assault with a semi-automatic firearm",
      "LOS ANGELES -- There's one essential difference between arguments at rapper A$AP Rocky 's trial: Prosecutors will say Thursday that the hip-hop star fired two shots at a former friend from a handgun, while defense lawyers will say he fired blanks from a gun that wasn't real.",
      "Jurors should begin deliberations by the afternoon on two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm for the 2021 shooting. If they convict Rocky of both, he could get up to 24 years in prison.",
      "The Grammy-nominated music star, fashion mogul and actor is the longtime partner of singing superstar Rihanna, with whom he has two toddler sons. She may appear in court for closing arguments after showing up sporadically \u2014 most recently last week, when they left the courthouse together for the first time, walking arm-in-arm.",
      "Testimony at the trial ended Tuesday, when Rocky and his lawyers told a judge he would not take the stand.",
      "The prosecution's case rests largely on the credibility of the man Rocky is alleged to have fired on. A$AP Relli, whose legal name is Terell Ephron, became friends with Rocky, born Rakim Mayers, in high school in New York, where both were members of a crew of creative types called the A$AP Mob.",
      "Their friendship continued after Rocky first gained global fame with a pair of No. 1 albums in 2012 and 2013, but by Nov. 6, 2021 their bond had become a beef.",
      "They met up outside a Hollywood hotel, and scuffled as soon as they saw each other. In a second confrontation moments later, Rocky fired the shots. Relli said his knuckles were grazed by one of them. The fights were partially captured on surveillance videos that are not clear enough for easy interpretation.",
      "A$AP Twelvyy, another member of the crew who was with Rocky, testified that Relli had been the aggressor, and that Rocky fired the shots as a warning to stop him from attacking another member of their crew.",
      "Twelvyy testified that Rocky fired blanks from a starter pistol that the rapper had been carrying for security since a music video shoot months earlier, and that everyone involved in the incident knew it. Rocky's tour manager also testified that he carried the phony gun.",
      "Neither gun was found or presented as evidence.",
      "Police who searched the area after a report of a shooting found no physical evidence, but Relli himself went to a police department two days later with two shell casings he said he'd picked up after returning to the scene.",
      "In closing arguments, the defense will contend that video evidence and text messages can't be trusted, nor can Relli. He also filed a civil suit in the case, and Rocky's attorneys will cast him as a jealous opportunist out for the money of a former friend who became famous. Relli vowed to do just that in text messages and in phone calls recorded by a mutual friend who gave the recordings to Rocky. Relli said in his testimony that the calls were faked.",
      "The prosecution will argue that Relli is justly seeking money after a genuine wrong was done to him. They point out that Relli's communications around the incident tell a consistent story \u2014 and never does he mention making anything up or knowing Rocky carried a prop gun. Prosecutors are likely to argue that the whole idea of the starter pistol \u2014 which only fires blanks \u2014 is a preposterous lie coordinated by Rocky's inner circle.",
      "In one of a series of arguments between lawyers that grew so nasty and personal during the trial that the judge began threatening fines, Deputy District Attorney John Lewin called the prop gun argument \u201cgarbage.\u201d",

      "At 100 years old, the Goodyear Blimp is an ageless star in the sky",
      "DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- Flying a few hundred feet above the streets and shores of Daytona Beach, the Goodyear Blimp draws a crowd.",
      "Onlookers stare and point. Drivers pull over for better looks, snapping pictures, recording videos and trying to line up the perfect selfie. For some, it\u2019s nostalgic. For others, it\u2019s a glimpse at a larger-than-life advertising icon.",
      "At 100 years old, the blimp is an ageless star in the sky. And the 246-foot-long airship will be in the background of the Daytona 500 on Sunday \u2014 roughly 1,500 feet above Daytona International Speedway, actually \u2014 to celebrate its latest and greatest anniversary tour.",
      "Even though remote camera technologies \u2014 drones, mostly \u2014 are improving regularly and changing the landscape of aerial footage, the blimp continues to carve out a niche. At Daytona, with the usual 40-car field racing around a 2\u00bd-mile superspeedway, views from the blimp aptly provide the scope of the event.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s great to show the pack racing,\u201d Fox Sports director Artie Kempner said, adding that he expected to use aerial shots from the blimp about 50 times during Sunday\u2019s race.",
      "The Goodyear Blimp has been a regular at major sporting events since flying above the 1955 Rose Bowl. A few years later, it became a service vehicle for television coverage while simultaneously functioning as a highly visible advertising platform. It\u2019s been at every Daytona 500 since 1962.",
      "During that streak, blimps have undergone wholesale changes and improved dramatically: steering technology, safety innovations, high-definition cameras, gyro-stabilized aerial views and much quieter rides thanks to relocated engines and propellers.",
      "Nowadays, riding on the blimp isn\u2019t much different from traveling on a small plane. The 12-seater comes with reclining seats, tray tables, seatbelts, a safety briefing and a bathroom with amazing views. A few windows serve as the only air conditioning onboard. The blimp offers a smooth ride even at top speed, creeping along at 73 mph \u2014 well below the cars pushing 200 mph on the track.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an iconic symbol for our nation, a floating piece of Americana,\u201d blimp pilot Jensen Kervern said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like it in the world.\u201d",
      "The blimp has covered more than 2,500 events and taken more than 500,000 passengers for rides, according to Goodyear. Former President Ronald Reagan might be the most famous passenger, and rapper Ice Cube raised the blimp\u2019s street cred when he included a line about it in his 1992 song titled \u201cIt Was A Good Day.\u201d",
      "But not just anyone can climb aboard. Rides are invitation only even though phones at blimp headquarters \u2014 the three U.S.-based airships are housed in California, Florida and Ohio \u2014 ring off the hook with people inquiring about buying a ride.",
      "As part of the blimp\u2019s 100-year anniversary celebration, however, Goodyear is giving three U.S. residents a chance to join the exclusive club and win a ride. The sweepstakes will provide each winner a certificate for two to fly on the blimp. The prize also includes $3,000 for travel expenses to one of Goodyear\u2019s airship hangars.",
      "It would be a once-in-a-lifetime experience, no doubt.",
      "The blimp flies low enough to spot pods of dolphins or flotillas of sea turtles in the Atlantic Ocean. The view over Daytona International Speedway is equally stunning, with the ability to see every inch of the famed track while watching (and hearing) race cars turning laps.",
      "Already in 2025, the Goodyear fleet has flown over the Rose Bowl, the Orange Bowl, the Pro Bowl and Pebble Beach. Its upcoming schedule includes the Academy Awards, Coachella and WrestleMania.",
      "But will the blimp survive another 100 years?",
      "Drone imagery and resolution continue to improve along with maneuverability, stability and flight longevity. And where drones can be flown by one person, the Goodyear Blimp crew at Daytona tops 20 staffers.",
      "But given the blimp\u2019s longevity, adaptability and celebrity, no one should bet against it sticking around for generations to come.",
      "\u201cDespite changes in technology and our environment, people still get so excited to see the blimp,\" Kervern said. \u201cIt's just an iconic symbol for our nation.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The discovery of hundreds of unmarked graves at an Indian residential school in Canada in 2021 was just the catalyst for \u201cSugarcane.\"",
      "The discovery of hundreds of unmarked graves at an Indian residential school in Canada in 2021 was just the catalyst for \u201cSugarcane.\u201d",
      "Julian Brave NoiseCat and Emily Kassie, the filmmakers behind the Oscar-nominated documentary, spent years investigating the truth behind just one of the institutions. \u201cSugarcane,\u201d now streaming on Hulu, paints a horrifying picture of the systemic abuses inflicted by the state-funded school and exposes for the first time a pattern of infanticide and babies born to Indigenous girls and fathered by priests.",
      "In the year since it debuted at the Sundance Film Festival, \u201cSugarcane\u201d has screened at the White House, for Canadian Parliament and for over a dozen indigenous communities in North America, sparking a grassroots movement and reckoning to find the truth about the other schools. It also marks the first time that an Indigenous North American filmmaker has received an Oscar nomination.",
      "From the 19th century until the 1970s, more than 150,000 First Nations children were required to attend state-funded Christian schools as part of a program to assimilate them into Canadian society. They were forced to convert to Christianity and not allowed to speak their native languages. Many were beaten and verbally abused, and up to 6,000 are said to have died. Nearly three-quarters of the 130 residential schools were run by Roman Catholic missionary congregations",
      "Canada\u2019s residential schools were based on similar facilities in the United States, where Catholic and Protestant denominations operated more than 150 boarding schools between the 19th and 20th centuries, according to researchers, that also were home to rampant abuse.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too often that we look everywhere else in the world to horrors and abuses happening, and that\u2019s important, but Native issues are rarely the issue of the day, and we believe that they deserve to be,\u201d Kassie said. \u201cThis story is the genocide that happened across North America, and we\u2019ve never grappled with it. Native people have rarely been the focal point of that kind of countrywide dialogue. We hope that \u2019Sugarcane\u201d helps to change that.\u201d",
      "As an investigative journalist and documentarian, Kassie had spent a decade making films about human rights abuses all over the world, from Afghanistan to Niger, but she\u2019d never turned her lens to her own country. When the news broke about the unmarked graves, she felt drawn to the story and reached out to NoiseCat to see if he\u2019d want to help. They became friends as cub reporters in New York who just happened to share neighboring desks.",
      "\u201cIn the years since, Julian had gone on to become an incredible writer and thinker and journalist focusing on indigenous life in North America. It felt like the natural fit,\u201d she said.",
      "While he was mulling it over, she went looking for a group to focus on and landed on St. Joseph\u2019s Mission near the Sugarcane Reservation of Williams Lake in British Columbia. Unbeknownst to her, that was the school NoiseCat's family attended. He\u2019d heard stories about his father being born nearby and found in a dumpster. Over the course of making the film they\u2019d discover that he was actually born in a dormitory and found in the school\u2019s incinerator.",
      "\u201cIt was a process for me to ultimately decide to tell the story in a personal and familial way,\u201d said NoiseCat, who during the making of the film lived with his father for the first time since he was around 6 years old.",
      "\u201cIt became very clear that he had these unaddressed questions from his birth and upbringing, and that I was in a position to help him ask those questions and in so doing, to address some of my own enduring pains and complications from his abandonment of me,\u201d NoiseCat said. \u201cThe big thing, though, was going to the Vatican with the late Chief Rick Gilbert and witnessing his incredible bravery.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve just been incredibly fortunate that this film has had real impact,\u201d NoiseCat said. \u201cI was really scared that telling such a personal and sometimes painful story might be a harmful thing. But really, thankfully, it\u2019s been a healing thing, not just for my family and our participants, but for Indian Country more broadly.\u201d",
      "Over the last year as the film has played at various festivals and for Indigenous communities on reservations, Kassie said that more survivors have been coming forward with their stories.",
      "In October, former President Joe Biden also formally apologized to Native Americans for the \u201csin\u201d of a government-run boarding school system that for decades forcibly separated children from their parents, calling it a \u201cblot on American history.\"",
      "\u201cThis is the origin story of North America,\u201d Kassie said. \u201cIt\u2019s the story of how the land was taken by separating six generations of kids, indigenous kids from their families... (and) most people don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "Kassie noted that while \u201cSugarcane\u201d is inspiring conversations within communities, it comes at a political moment where governments are not actively supporting continued investigation and accountability.",
      "In a film industry with deep roots in the Western genre and problematic, racist depictions of Native Americans as impediments to westward expansion, authentic representation of indigenous stories on screen is still in the early days. In 97 years of the Oscars, no Native American person has ever won a competitive acting prize. Lily Gladstone, who is an executive producer on \u201cSugarcane,\u201d was passed over last year for best actress.",
      "When the Oscar nomination came through for \u201cSugarcane,\u201d they made sure they had their facts right before touting its own historic nature: NoiseCat was indeed the first indigenous North American filmmaker to get one.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really special,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd at the same time, it\u2019s kind of shocking.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe hope the film shows that there\u2019s still so much about this foundational story in North America that needs to be known and therefore needs to be investigated,\u201d NoiseCat said. \u201cThis film should be seen not as an ending, but a beginning to a real grappling with this story.\u201d",
      "He added: \"More broadly, there are so many painful, important, beautiful and sometimes even triumphant stories that come from Native people that come from Indian Country. It\u2019s my hope that more Native stories and storytellers and films get recognized moving forward and get made.\u201d",
      "If \u201cSugarcane\u201d is named the winner at the Oscars on March 2, NoiseCat promised it will be an acceptance speech to watch.",
      "\u201cWe will make it a moment,\u201d NoiseCat said. \u201cIf we win, I\u2019m going to get up there, I\u2019m going to say something, and we\u2019re going to do it well too.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "At least 29 recruits have died during basic training at law enforcement academies nationwide in the last decade",
      "Ronald Donat\u2019s longtime dream of becoming a police officer was in jeopardy.",
      "The 41-year-old struggled to stand after completing a flurry of pushups, sprints and pullups in the notoriously grueling start of physical training that recruits call \u201cHell Day.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou are dead!\u201d classmates recall a sergeant berating Donat, ordering him to sit on concrete at the suburban Atlanta police academy.",
      "Donat, a Haitian immigrant on his third attempt to land a law enforcement job, assured instructors he wasn\u2019t giving up. He managed to get off the ground and rejoin recruits in a bear crawl exercise. But he soon went limp.",
      "One hundred minutes after training began that October 2021 morning, he was dead, according to records obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "Donat is among at least 29 recruits who died during basic training at law enforcement academies around the country in the last decade, an AP investigation found. Most died of exertion, dehydration, heat stroke and other conditions tied to intense exercise \u2014 often on the first day of training, like Donat. Others died several weeks in, sometimes after suffering trauma during boxing or use-of-force drills or collapsing during high-stakes timed runs on hot days.",
      "Experts and police advocates were surprised by AP\u2019s findings \u2014 based on an extensive review of lists of law enforcement deaths in every state, workplace safety records and news reports \u2014 and said many of the deaths were preventable. No federal agency or outside organization comprehensively tracks recruit deaths, unlike officers who die in the line of duty.",
      "\u201cTraining shouldn't have one death, much less 29,\" said David Jude, a retired Kentucky State Police academy commander and instructor. \u201cTo hear that number, it is shocking.\"",
      "Black recruits represented nearly 60% of those who died, a striking disparity given that federal data show Black officers make up 12% of local police forces. Many carried sickle cell trait, a condition most prevalent among Black Americans that increases the risk of serious injury following extreme exertion.",
      "Overall, the deaths amount to a tiny percentage of the nation\u2019s 800,000 sworn officers but highlight another hazard in a profession where shootings, car accidents and other dangers are part of the job.",
      "AP\u2019s tally shows the deaths have grown at a time when departments are tapping an older and more diverse pool of applicants to address officer shortages. More than two-thirds of the deaths occurred since 2020.",
      "A Texas recruit collapsed minutes after instructors denied his request for water, saying: \u201cYou can\u2019t get water in a fight,\u201d video obtained by AP shows.",
      "An Arkansas cadet died after he was forced to run wearing long pants in the scorching midday sun. A North Carolina trainee\u2019s temperature was 106 degrees an hour after his death, when he had no water breaks during an hourlong obstacle course.",
      "Citing similar cases, one expert warned in a medical journal in mid-2023 of a \u201ctroubling spate of exertional collapse and death\u201d of police trainees.",
      "\u201cThis sad tragedy is preventable, but will not become so until our police chiefs begin to heed the message,\u201d wrote Dr. Randy Eichner, a retired University of Oklahoma professor who has long studied exertion-related deaths.",
      "But deaths have only continued to mount. At least five were recorded in 2024, including a New York City recruit who died of heat stroke, a Kentucky man who exerted himself during water-based survival training and a Massachusetts cadet who became unresponsive during defensive tactics training.",
      "Police leaders say some deaths can be prevented through improved awareness and practices, acknowledging that the field needs to better screen for and accommodate health conditions that put recruits at risk and to rein in unnecessarily harsh drills.",
      "\u201cNot only are we potentially putting students in danger, but we\u2019re also putting instructors in precarious situations where they may not know about the risks,\u201d said Jude, an expert witness in the 2022 death of 38-year-old Jonesboro, Arkansas, recruit Vincent Parks.",
      "Jude cited a law passed in Arkansas, amid outrage over video showing Parks collapsing while training on a hot afternoon, as a positive step. It requires trainers be educated on heat exhaustion, dehydration and symptoms of sudden cardiac arrest, and mandates that instructors remove cadets from physical activities if they faint or lose consciousness.",
      "AP's investigation found instances in which recruits who were in serious medical distress were pushed to continue training before they died. In addition to calling off drills in such cases, academy leaders must ensure adequate hydration and breaks and limit training when heat makes it unsafe, experts said.",
      "Bill Alexander, CEO of the National Law Enforcement Memorial in Washington, said the number of deaths could be reduced but probably not eliminated given the nature of policing, which can require chasing and arresting combative suspects.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re training people physically and if you\u2019re training them hard, you\u2019re going to have these very rare medical events,\u201d said Alexander, who previously led an academy in Maryland.",
      "Still, some leaders say the field needs urgent action to better protect recruits.",
      "\u201cIt was just heartbreaking. I\u2019ll never forget it. And I\u2019ll do anything at all to get this message out,\u201d said Sheriff Charmaine McGuffey of Hamilton County, Ohio, who witnessed the 2023 death of 36-year-old Marcus Zeigler after he collapsed during a training run. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about life or death.\u201d",
      "When Ronald Donat arrived at the Gwinnett County Police Department Academy in Lawrenceville, Georgia, he thought he\u2019d finally found his place in law enforcement.",
      "He always wanted to become an officer, but his wife, Sharline Volcy, said she initially discouraged him due to safety concerns when their children were young. Both immigrated from Haiti in the 1990s to New Jersey, where they met at church.",
      "Donat earned a college degree and worked various jobs, including installing satellites and cable, but longed for the responsibility and community service that policing would bring.",
      "He finally applied but was initially passed over. When Gwinnett County recruited applicants from New Jersey, Donat applied because he already had a sister living in Georgia, Volcy said.",
      "Georgia's second-largest police agency, Gwinnett County has held hiring events around the country as it struggles to fill hundreds of vacancies. It\u2019s offered bonuses to combat the officer shortage, which grew during the coronavirus pandemic and 2020 protests against police brutality.",
      "A physician who evaluated Donat for the department concluded he was healthy, with no concerning conditions, according to a form the doctor submitted to the state's police standards agency. Following the normal process for the county and most U.S. police departments, the doctor didn\u2019t screen Donat for sickle cell trait.",
      "Donat began working out with other recruits, passed a state-mandated physical fitness test and was given badge 2423. He smiled for a selfie in a squad car. He shared advice with a classmate: \u201cNever give up.\u201d",
      "Up to 3 million Black citizens in the U.S. have sickle cell trait, yet many adults with the genetic condition don't know their status, researchers say. Unlike people with sickle cell disease, they carry only one gene for sickle cell, and one normal gene.",
      "The condition, which is diagnosed through a blood test, doesn\u2019t usually affect their daily lives. But it can cause decreased blood flow and muscle breakdown after intense exertion, dehydration or high body temperatures. In very rare cases, that can result in collapse and death.",
      "The NCAA and U.S. military now screen recruits for the condition, which has contributed to some deaths during football practices and boot camps. Researchers say exertional deaths among college athletes plummeted after NCAA-mandated testing and precautions went into effect in 2010, while the impact of the military programs is under review. Slowly building intensity, resting between drills, remaining hydrated during workouts and responding quickly to signs of distress are recommended.",
      "Most police departments have no such screening programs. Many longtime law enforcement trainers say they\u2019ve never heard of the condition, which AP found was cited as a contributing factor in several deaths and serious injuries of recruits.",
      "McGuffey, the Ohio sheriff, said the cause of Marcus Zeigler\u2019s death was initially a mystery. Before his collapse in May 2023, Zeigler was in peak condition and a top recruit, she said.",
      "The sheriff said she learned about sickle cell trait afterward from another employee, who himself had been seriously injured during academy training. She asked the coroner to investigate whether Zeigler had the condition. After ruling that Zeigler died of exertional heatstroke, the coroner's office added sickle cell trait as a contributing factor.",
      "Since the death, Hamilton County has started screening recruits for the condition, which costs $75 per test.",
      "For Donat and his 27 classmates, academy staffers planned an intense hourlong workout -- a first-day ritual designed to test physical and mental fitness.",
      "Pushups. Flutter kicks. More pushups. Hill sprints. Burpees. Pullups. Bear crawls.",
      "Trainers say the exercises set the tone for the monthslong academy, which seeks to instill a never-quit mindset and prepare recruits for the most dangerous aspects of policing. But the military-style drills have long led to allegations of harsh treatment that cross the line into hazing.",
      "The risks were so well-known that an ambulance usually sat nearby on the first day at the Gwinnett County academy. But that year, a major declined the staff\u2019s request, saying an ambulance would create the perception of danger, according to statements in an internal investigation report.",
      "Donat kept up with classmates for 45 minutes but became exhausted during a set of pullups and couldn\u2019t complete the next exercise, air squats.",
      "An instructor ordered Donat to sit: \u201cYou are dead!\u201d six recruits recalled him screaming, according to the investigation.",
      "The instructor insisted that he told Donat \u201cYou are done!\u201d Either way, it was intended as a reminder, the investigation found, that giving up on police work could lead to death.",
      "Donat didn\u2019t want to quit. Three minutes later, he got up with the help of another recruit and got in formation for a 25-foot bear crawl. \u201cEverything is all right, Donat,\u201d a recruit assured him. But Donat collapsed and stopped breathing.",
      "A paramedic on scene quickly treated Donat with oxygen and chest compressions. An ambulance arrived 10 minutes later.",
      "After Donat was pronounced dead at a hospital, instructors wondered whether his life could have been saved with an ambulance on site.",
      "Hours after Donat died, Gwinnett County released a statement saying Donat had been \u201cinstructed by supervising staff to rest\u201d after becoming lethargic.",
      "A fellow recruit who saw that statement on the news questioned the claim, texting classmates, \u201cas far as I know I never heard that or saw that.\u201d One responded that Donat was last seen in the planking position before his collapse.",
      "A county medical examiner ruled Donat died of natural causes, saying he had an enlarged heart prone to abnormal rhythms. That shocked his wife, Volcy, who said her husband was a fit soccer player with no known heart issues.",
      "The autopsy report didn\u2019t mention sickle cell trait. Volcy believes her husband had it \u2013 she\u2019s learned their daughters do, she said, and she has tested negative. Today, Gwinnett County still doesn\u2019t screen recruits for the condition, spokesperson Sgt. Collin Flynn said.",
      "The department\u2019s investigation, completed weeks after Donat\u2019s death, found no policy violations and resulted in no disciplinary action. A major who led the investigation concluded, \u201cI cannot imagine a scenario, had different actions been taken, that would have changed the tragic death of Recruit Donat.\u201d",
      "Still, the department now requires an ambulance with emergency responders on scene during the first day of physical training, Flynn said. Changes to the workout allow instructors to keep a closer eye on those who are struggling, he said.",
      "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration didn\u2019t investigate because local government agencies aren\u2019t under its jurisdiction. That\u2019s the case in many states, which have not extended workplace safety protections to municipal employees such as police officers.",
      "Because most of the recruits in AP\u2019s investigation hadn\u2019t been sworn in as officers before they died, their names don't appear on the national memorial for deceased officers or some state memorials. And many of their families can\u2019t qualify for death benefits.",
      "Aware of those stakes last year, the police chief in Knoxville, Tennessee, summoned a judge to the hospital room of unconscious recruit Wisbens Antoine.",
      "On that February night, a fellow recruit took the oath on behalf of Antoine, who\u2019d collapsed during training a week before graduation.",
      "Hours later, Officer Antoine, 32, died.",
      "Like Donat, he was a Haitian immigrant who left behind a wife and two daughters.",
      "In Gwinnett County, officials honored Donat by adding his name to its Fallen Heroes Memorial in 2022. But his name isn't on federal or state memorials. Donat\u2019s family was ineligible for state death benefits because he hadn\u2019t graduated.",
      "Congress in 2021 passed a law allowing trainees\u2019 relatives to be eligible for the same federal death benefits as those of sworn officers. The program includes a payment of nearly $450,000, plus college assistance.",
      "But three years later, Volcy said, she\u2019s still awaiting a ruling from the Department of Justice on her application for benefits, which she said she desperately needs to afford college tuition and other expenses.",
      "Volcy was unaware of the investigation into her husband\u2019s death until AP gave her the report last year. She said the department put recruits like Donat \u2013 and their families \u2013 at risk.",
      "\u201cIt is disappointing to know that excessive strain and physical activities brought an end to his life,\u201d Volcy said. \u201cWhat was supposed to be a new beginning, a lifetime achievement, a dream come true turned children into orphans, a wife into a widow and a lifetime of grief.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Republicans are weighing billions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid, jeopardizing health care coverage for some of the 80 million U.S. adults and children enrolled in the safety net program",
      "WASHINGTON -- Republicans are weighing billions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid, threatening health care coverage for some of the 80 million U.S. adults and children enrolled in the safety net program.",
      "The signing up of millions of additional Americans for taxpayer-funded health care coverage like Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act's marketplace during the Biden administration was lauded by Democrats as a success. But Republicans, who are looking to slash federal spending and offer lucrative tax cuts to corporations and wealthier Americans, now see a big target ripe for trimming. The $880 billion Medicaid program is financed mostly by federal taxpayers, who pick up as much as 80% of the tab in some states. And states, too, have said they're having trouble financing years of growth and sicker patients who enrolled in Medicaid.",
      "To whittle down the budget, the GOP-controlled Congress is eyeing work requirements for Medicaid. It's also considering paying a shrunken, fixed rate to states. All told, over the next decade, Republican lawmakers could try to siphon billions of dollars from the nearly-free health care coverage offered to the poorest Americans.",
      "Weeks before Congress began debating those changes, Republican governors in Arkansas, Ohio and South Dakota were making moves to implement Medicaid work rules of their own, likely to be approved by President Donald Trump's administration.",
      "And other cuts could be on the way. Already on Friday, the Republican administration announced it would shrink the Affordable Care Act's navigator program annual budget by 90% to $10 million. Navigators are stationed throughout the country to help people enrolled in ACA and Medicaid coverage and have helped boost enrollment in health care programs.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana has floated the idea of tying work to Medicaid.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s common sense,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cLittle things like that make a big difference not only in the budgeting process but in the morale of the people. You know, work is good for you. You find dignity in work.\u201d",
      "But about 92% of Medicaid enrollees are already working, attending school or caregiving, according to an analysis by KFF, a health policy research firm.",
      "Republicans have suggested a work requirement similar to the conditions for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly called food stamps. Those ages 16 to 59 must work or volunteer at least 80 hours a month if they are not in school, caring for a child under age 6, disabled, pregnant or homeless. On average, a SNAP enrollee's monthly household income is $852, and the enrollee typically receives $239 in benefits.",
      "During a GOP House retreat last month at Trump's golf resort in Doral, Florida, Republicans said the requirement could motivate people to find employment \u2014 maybe even a job that comes with health insurance.",
      "Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., said the spending cuts should not be \u201con the back of the poor and needy\" but instead target those who shouldn't be getting the benefit.",
      "\u201cWhy should somebody literally sit on the beach and surf, buy their sandwiches from the food truck with their food stamps and then pick up low-cost housing and so on, while writing a book,\" Issa said, noting that he was describing a constituent from more than a decade ago.",
      "Other cuts on the table include a proposal to change the federal government's reimbursement to a per-person limit.",
      "That would shift the costs to states, which might be forced to make tough choices about who or what they cover, said Joan Alker, executive director of the Georgetown Center for Children and Families.",
      "\u201cPeople still have health care needs even if you cut their coverage,\u201d Alker said. \u201cTheir health care needs are not going to go away.\u201d",
      "Cuts to the program could also prompt upset, with just over half of U.S. adults saying the government spends \u201ctoo little\u201d on Medicaid. Only 15% say it\u2019s spending \u201ctoo much,\u201d according to a January Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll.",
      "President Joe Biden's administration largely blocked states from enacting work rules of their own and required 10 states to remove the requirement for Medicaid coverage.",
      "With Trump now back in charge, some Republican-led states are pressing ahead of Congress to add work rules again. Governors in Arkansas, Iowa and Ohio have announced they'd pursue approval from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to introduce work requirements again. And last fall, South Dakota voters signed off on a plan to add a work rule.",
      "When Arkansas enacted a work requirement during the Trump years, about 18,000 people lost coverage. The rule was later blocked by a federal judge and Biden's Democratic administration.",
      "Some people lost coverage because they had trouble accessing the state's website to log their hours or had other procedural problems, said Trevor Hawkins, an attorney with Legal Aid of Arkansas. The organization sued on behalf of Medicaid beneficiaries who were dropped from coverage.",
      "\u201cThese hoops, these things are very consequential,\u201d Hawkins said \u201cThere were a lot of people having hard times.\u201d",
      "In Georgia, 47-year-old Paul Mikell is all too familiar with those hoops.",
      "He's enrolled in Georgia's Pathways to Coverage plan, which offers Medicaid for a slice of impoverished people who make just too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid. Georgia, which has not expanded Medicaid like most other states, requires that people work, volunteer or go to school for 80 hours a month in exchange for accessing the expanded health coverage.",
      "Mikell makes 15-mile (24-kilometer) monthly drives to a government office where he reports his work hours. Sometimes, he said, when he goes online to check whether his hours were logged, they\u2019re not there.",
      "He likened navigating the online system to a battle \u2014 one fought on a computer at the library or borrowed from a friend.",
      "In Idaho, where lawmakers are considering a state work rule and a three-year limit for Medicaid benefits, family physician Peter Crane estimates about two-thirds of his patients are enrolled in the program.",
      "Many work on farms, on ranches or in the local phosphate mines. Before the state expanded Medicaid to cover those with incomes of up to 138% of the poverty level, many of his uninsured patients avoided the doctor entirely. One ignored abdominal pain for months, to the point of needing hospitalization for a severe gallbladder infection, he said.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not outliers,\" Crane said of those enrolled in Medicaid during a state hearing last week. \u201cThey\u2019re hardworking citizens of our state who are employed and running small businesses.\u201d",
      "Democrats are warning of the side effects for health care facilities, including rural hospitals and nursing homes. Hospitals have benefited from increased enrollment in health insurance programs such as Medicaid because it guarantees payment for a patient's treatment.",
      "\u201cHospitals will close, including in rural America and urban America and the heartland of America,\u201d House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York warned during a recent speech on the House floor. \u201cNursing homes will be shut down, and everyday Americans, children, seniors, those who are suffering with disabilities, will be hurt.\u201d",

      "A Philippine village in the densely populated capital region has launched a battle against dengue by offering a token bounty to residents for captured mosquitos \u2014 dead or alive",
      "MANILA, Philippines -- A village in the densely populated Philippine capital region launched a battle against dengue Wednesday by offering a token bounty to residents for captured mosquitos \u2014 dead or alive.",
      "The unusual strategy adopted by the Addition Hills village in Mandaluyong City reflects growing concern after the nearby city of Quezon declared an outbreak of the mosquito-borne illness over the weekend. Eight more areas reported an upsurge in cases of the potentially deadly viral infection.",
      "At least 28,234 dengue cases have been recorded in the Philippines this year up to Feb. 1, a 40% increase compared to the same period last year, according to health department statistics. Quezon City declared a dengue outbreak Saturday after deaths this year reached 10 people, mostly children, out of 1,769 residents infected.",
      "A urban village of more than 100,000 residents living in crowded neighborhoods and residential condominium towers, Addition Hills has done clean-ups, canal de-clogging and a hygiene campaign to combat dengue. But when cases spiked to 42 this year and two young students died, village leader Carlito Cernal decided to intensify the battle.",
      "\u201cThere was an alarm,\u201d Cernal told The Associated Press. \u201cI found a way.\"",
      "Residents will get a reward of one Philippines peso (just over 1 cent) for every five mosquitos or mosquito larva they turn in, Cernal said.",
      "Critics warned the strategy could backfire if desperate people start breeding mosquitoes for the reward. Cernal said that was unlikely because the campaign would be terminated as soon as the uptick in cases eases.",
      "As the campaign began, about a dozen mosquito hunters showed up at the village office. Miguel Labag, a 64-year-old scavenger, handed a jug with 45 dark mosquito larvas squirming in some water and received a reward of nine pesos (15 cents).",
      "\u201cThis is a big help,\u201d Labag said, smiling. \u201cI can buy coffee.\u201d",
      "Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection found in tropical countries worldwide. It can cause joint pain, nausea, vomiting and rashes, and in severe cases can cause breathing problems, hemorrhaging and organ failure. While there is no specific treatment for the illness, medical care to maintain a person\u2019s fluid levels is seen as critical.",
      "Officials in another village in Quezon City were considering releasing swarms of frogs to eat mosquitoes.",
      "Health Secretary Teodoro Herbosa said it\u2019s crucial to clean up mosquito breeding sites, and for anyone who might be infected to seek immediate medical attention. Despite an increase in dengue infections, the Philippines has managed to maintain low mortality rates, he said.",
      "Dengue cases surged unexpectedly ahead of the rainy season, which starts in June, likely because of intermittent downpours that have left stagnant pools of water where dengue-causing mosquitos can breed, Health Undersecretary Alberto Domingo said, adding that climate change was likely contributing to off-season downpours."

      "Florida's doctor shortage is expected to grow in the next decade, with one study projecting a statewide need of 18,000 physicians  --  including 6,000 primary care doctors  --  by 2035.",
      "",
      "\"This is a huge, huge issue,\" said Matthew Smeltzer, a managing partner of Capstone Recruiting Advisors, a company that helps hospitals, physician practices, and other employers find and hire doctors. \"It probably hits small towns the hardest, just because most people would prefer to live in a midsize or large community.\"",
      "",
      "In this challenging environment, Havana leaders are hoping that want ads and rent-free perks will make their small town stand out and persuade a doctor to practice here.",
      "",
      "Wilkerson describes the community, just south of the Georgia border, as an ideal place to raise a family. Its country roads are lined with farms, pastures, and churches. Main Street downtown features antique stores, gift shops, a general store, and restaurants.",
      "",
      "\"Everything you would imagine a Hallmark movie to be is kind of where we live,\" Wilkerson said. \"It's people who still care and look out for each other, and neighbors are actually friends.\"",
      "",
      "Offering generous incentives was how town leaders got Newberry to practice in Havana in 1993. The town gave Newberry an initial deal similar to the one it's offering now, and later began providing him about $15,000 a year in financial support.",
      "",
      "Newberry, who served about 2,000 patients, declined to be interviewed. \"I'm just retiring!\" he said in an email, adding that \"the town has chosen unconventional ways\" of recruiting a doctor.",
      "",
      "By subsidizing office space and the use of medical equipment to attract a doctor, Havana is looking out for the needs of its residents, Wilkerson said.",
      "",
      "Without a town doctor, some of Newberry's former patients now have to travel to Tallahassee, about a 30-minute drive southeast of Havana. Others are seeing doctors in Quincy, about a 20-minute drive west.",
      "",
      "\"Our hope is that they'll come back when we find us a new doctor,\" Havana Mayor Eddie Bass said.",
      "",
      "Susan Freiden, a former town manager who retired in 2006, said having a local doctor is also important to meet the needs of the town's low-income residents, many of whom are older adults. \"Not everybody can get to Tallahassee to get a doctor,\" she said. \"Not everybody has transportation.\"",
      "",
      "But it remains to be seen whether rent-free office space and equipment are enough to attract a doctor to Havana. The town's recruitment campaign has drawn a lot of interest from nurse practitioners, but few primary care physicians have applied for the position.",
      "",
      "Town leaders say they're holding out hope of finding a family physician, who can practice and prescribe medications independently.",
      "",
      "\"We would really, you know, prefer to have a true doctor that can handle it all for us,\" Bass said.",
      "",
      "Smeltzer, the physician headhunter, said primary care physicians are in especially low supply. And though in his experience Florida, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas are among the places doctors want to live and work, it often takes something extra to persuade them to work in a small town, he said.",
      "",
      "\"If someone wants to practice in a small town, they're more likely to go to where they have ties, whether it's themselves or their spouse or significant other,\" he said.",
      "",
      "The challenge for a community of Havana's size, Smeltzer said, is that \"there may literally be nobody from that town that went to med school. Or, if there is, maybe it's one. But were they a primary care physician?\"",
      "",
      "Still, there is a silver lining. Smeltzer said young physicians are placing a high value on work-life balance and meaningful relationships with their patients  --  qualities that may give an edge to a small-town, independent practice.",
      "",
      "\"We hear quality of life and work-life balance far more in the last 3 to 5 years than we ever heard before,\" he said, \"and that's almost in lockstep with compensation in terms of what they're focusing on.\"",
      "",
      "Freiden, the former Havana town manager, said those are the same values Newberry had when he started to practice here. She even became one of his patients.",
      "",
      "\"He was just perfect,\" she said, \"because he wasn't all about the money, if you can imagine that. He was kind of a different kind of physician.\"",

      "In the rural villages of South Africa, U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s sudden freeze on foreign aid impacts hundreds of thousands of HIV patients",
      "UMZIMKHULU, South Africa -- At a rural village in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province, unemployed 19-year-old Nozuko Majola is trying to figure out if she has enough money for the one-hour ride to collect her much-needed HIV medication, usually delivered to her home that can't be easily reached due to rough, untarred roads.",
      "Majola is one of millions of patients in South Africa affected by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s global foreign aid freeze, raising worries about HIV patients defaulting on treatment, infection rates going up and eventually a rise in deaths.",
      "In 2024, think tank Human Sciences Research Council released figures showing that Majola's province recorded the second-highest HIV prevalence in the country, at 16%, with at least 1,300 young people estimated to contract the disease every week.",
      "KwaZulu-Natal also had the highest number of people living with HIV in South Africa in 2022, about 1,980,000. The country counts more than 7.5 million people infected with the virus that causes AIDS \u2014 more than any other nation.",
      "There are 5.5 million South Africans receiving antiretroviral treatment, whose funding is now in question after Trump suspended the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. It contributes more than $400 million a year to South Africa's HIV programs and nongovernmental organizations, about 17% of the total funding, according to the Health Ministry.",
      "Globally, PEPFAR is credited with saving at least 26 million lives since its inception in 2003, according to the U.N. AIDS agency.",
      "Last week, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to temporarily lift the funding freeze, while the U.S. Embassy in South Africa said PEPFAR projects would resume under a limited waiver. However, aid groups dealing with HIV have already shuttered with closure notices hanging at the entrances and PEPFAR-branded vehicles standing idle, with patients diverted to struggling health facilities.",
      "Most of the PEPFAR funding is channeled through non-governmental organizations, which run programs that compliment health care services provided by the government.",
      "For Majola and other HIV patients in the Umzimkhulu region, where unemployment is rife and most people rely on subsistence farming and government welfare grants, the aid freeze has disrupted their lives.",
      "\u201cThings will be tough around here, and a lot of people will default on their treatment because we really struggle with transport,\" she said. \u201cThe mobile clinics hardly come here.\u201d",
      "The freeze has hurt various groups that can no longer provide treatment, causing an influx of patients to already overstretched public facilities. Along with the medication, these programs also allowed health personnel to test HIV patients in far-flung villages, which has been a lifeline for many, especially those afraid to visit public facilities due to the social stigma attached to HIV.",
      "In addition, nearly 15,000 health workers whose salaries are funded through PEPFAR are left wondering if they have lost their livelihoods.",
      "About an hour away in the district of Umgungundlovu, which the think tank says has the highest number of HIV cases in South Africa, HIV counselors gathered in a small office discussing how best to assist patients like Majola. A manager at a nearby health clinic wondered how to handle the administrative work that is piling up after PEPFAR-funded workers withdrew.",
      "\u201cPeople who were doing administration and data capturing, whose salaries were funded by PEPFAR, have left. We are a small facility and we cannot handle such a workload,\u201d said the manager, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.",
      "Nozuko Ngcaweni has been on HIV treatment for about 30 years. One of her children was also infected and died at age 17. She said the aid suspension already impacted her community and many missed their treatment.",
      "\u201cNot long ago, we said by 2030, we want to see an HIV-free generation. But if things remain as is, we will not achieve that. We will have to deal with deaths,\u201d she said.",
      "Mzamo Zondi, a provincial manager of the Treatment Action Campaign, which advocates for access to HIV treatment for the poor, has been monitoring the impact of the aid freeze in Umgungudlovu.",
      "\"Our response (to HIV) is likely to falter as we struggle to stop newly infected cases,\" he said. \u201cThis is a matter of life and death.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "More adults have sought insight on whether they have autism in the last decade",
      "ATLANTA -- Natasha Nelson, a 35-year old entrepreneur in Stone Mountain, Georgia, didn't have an innate sense of social norms. She didn't know why people meeting for the first time would choose to engage in small talk instead of deep conversations, or why people like to make their beds.",
      "Then, a few years ago, she was diagnosed with autism, just after her youngest daughter received the same.",
      "\u201cIf your life has always felt like it was in chaos and you don\u2019t feel comfortable and you don\u2019t feel like you thrive and you just feel like you\u2019re constantly surviving and going from one thing to the next, what you got to lose?\u201d Nelson said, encouraging people to seek a diagnosis.",
      "Common signs of autism include trouble with social communication and a fixation on certain routines or topics \u2014 Nelson says \u201cpeople have become my special interest now\u201d \u2014 and may go unnoticed during someone\u2019s childhood.",
      "But it can be costly and difficult to obtain an autism diagnosis later in life due to a shortage of medical professionals trained to work specifically with adults. Here's more information on what you should know about adult autism diagnoses.",
      "Autism spectrum disorder is a range of intellectual, language and social difficulties, like rigidly following routines, having fixed or obsessive interests and struggling to hold eye contact or understand nonverbal communication. Autism is typically diagnosed during childhood, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends all children be screened as early as 18 months.",
      "More adults have sought insight on their own neurodiversity in the last decade \u2014 often after their children are diagnosed or after seeing social media posts. A study published last year in JAMA Network Open showed a 452% increase in autism diagnoses among adults age 26 to 34 from 2011 to 2022.",
      "Some traits of autism can go unnoticed until adulthood, when there are new social demands. Others may have learned how to hide certain behaviors, known as masking.",
      "\u201cAdults have learned to compensate over time,\u201d said Whitney Ence, a psychologist at the University of California San Francisco who works with autistic adults. \u201cThey may have learned like \u2018I can\u2019t display that in public, and so I do that in private.\u2019\"",
      "There's also an overlap of symptoms between various disorders like ADHD and OCD that can complicate an autism diagnosis due to difficulties with nonverbal social cues or executive functions like attention span, working memory and problem-solving.",
      "Symptoms present differently for everyone, and many of the traits are common for people without autism, like enjoying routines or enjoying going down rabbit holes of information.",
      "But to meet the diagnostic definition of autism, the symptoms must cause significant impairment, said Dr. Arthur Westover, a psychiatrist who specializes in autism at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re human beings in general. We like routines ... just having a bit of pleasure and feeling better with routines does not mean you\u2019re autistic,\" Westover said. \"It goes a little bit deeper than that.\u201d",
      "Russell Lehmann, 34, has lived with his autism diagnosis for more than 20 years. The motivational speaker has routines that he describes as both comfortable and stressful. Eating the same food and buying the same groceries, he said, brings him comfort. But if he skips going to the gym for an hour and a half every day, he becomes overwhelmed with feelings of depression and failure.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like no gym, no day,\u201d he said. \u201c... My routine is an incredibly existential burden, because every night I go to bed knowing I have to do a routine I do not like simply to function.\u201d",
      "While there are various online screening tools, autism is a complex diagnosis, so experts recommend talking to your primary care physician for a psychiatry referral.",
      "That psychiatrist might want to interview people who were present in your early childhood, like family and friends, who can attest to symptoms being present at that time.",
      "Some psychiatrists may refer you to a psychologist, who can give you a standardized diagnostic autism test or will use their own clinical judgement. There is no brain scan or blood test for autism.",
      "Getting an autism diagnosis as an adult can be costly and take some time. Westover said there's a major shortage of specialists who work with autistic adults. Nelson's diagnosis took three years and she paid more than $3,000 out-of-pocket.",
      "Ence also suggests that you ask yourself a few questions when considering getting a professional diagnosis, and to know that you may run into a waitlist: \u201cWhat is leading me down this pathway to think that I need a professional diagnosis? Do I need access to services? Are there services I don\u2019t have available to me?\u201d",

      "Friday's ruling came after a Kansas City judge ruled last year that abortions were now legal in the state but kept certain regulations on the books while a lawsuit by abortion-rights advocates played out.",
      "One regulation required abortion facilities to be licensed by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. Planned Parenthood said most of its facilities could not comply with some of the licensing rules, including \u201cmedically irrelevant\u201d size requirements for hallways, rooms and doors.",
      "Planned Parenthood argued that the licensing law required providers to give \u201cmedically unnecessary and invasive\u201d pelvic exams to anyone receiving an abortion, including medication abortions, according to court documents. The plaintiffs also said some of the regulations on Planned Parenthood centers were so strict, \u201cmost health centers or doctors\u2019 office simply do not meet\u201d them.",
      "Jackson County Circuit Judge Jerri Zhang said in her ruling that the licensing requirement is \u201cfacially discriminatory because it does not treat services provided in abortion facilities the same as other types of similarly situated health care, including miscarriage care.\u201d",
      "Voters approved the measure adding abortion rights to the constitution in November. That amendment did not legalize abortion in the state outright but instead required judges to reconsider laws that had almost completely banned the procedure.",

      "\u201cToday\u2019s decision affirms what we\u2019ve already long known \u2014 the state\u2019s abortion facility licensing requirements were not about patient safety, but rather another politically motivated barrier to prevent patients seeking abortion from getting the care they need,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "The ruling is a temporary order pending the outcome of the lawsuit by abortion-rights advocates.",
      "Planned Parenthood and other advocates sued to overturn Missouri\u2019s near-total abortion ban almost immediately after voters amended the constitution to protect reproductive rights. Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey is fighting the lawsuit.",

      "\u201cWith this change the landscape for Missourians and the entire Midwest region will be transformed, as patients will have greater access to abortion care than they have had in years,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "Missouri is one of five states where voters approved ballot measures in 2024 to enshrining abortion rights in their constitutions. Nevada voters also approved an amendment but will need to pass it again in 2026 for it to take effect.",
      "Another measure banning discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d prevailed in New York.",
      "Missouri\u2019s constitutional amendment allows lawmakers to restrict abortion after viability with exceptions to \u201cprotect the life or physical or mental health of the pregnant person.\u201d",
      "The term \u201cviability\u201d is used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus.

      "Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta believes the accumulation of long-term injuries experienced by some clubs is an \u201caccident waiting to happen\u201d because of the increased demands on players in a busy soccer calendar",
      "LONDON -- Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta believes the accumulation of long-term injuries experienced by some clubs is an \u201caccident waiting to happen\u201d because of the increased demands on players in a congested soccer calendar.",
      "Arteta said he felt a \u201cbig pain in the tummy\u201d after seeing Kai Havertz pick up a serious hamstring injury at the end of a light training session in Dubai that will rule the Germany forward out for the rest of the season.",
      "It further stretches Arsenal\u2019s resources up front, with Gabriel Jesus having ruptured his ACL, winger Bukayo Saka having not played since December because of a hamstring issue and another wide player, Gabriel Martinelli, set to miss the next month also with a hamstring injury.",
      "Two more games per team were added to the first stage of this season's Champions League, while Arsenal also went deep in the English League Cup \u2014 it was eliminated by Newcastle in the two-legged semifinals \u2014 and is in a title race with Liverpool in the Premier League.",
      "An expanded and revamped Club World Cup, which takes place in the United States at the end of the season and lasts a month, also extends the schedule for many teams, though not Arsenal this year. Some players have openly complained that it is detrimental to their performance and health and the busy match schedule is facing legal challenges and the possibility of strike action.",
      "For Arteta, it\u2019s no surprise to see injury rates soar at Arsenal because of the extra load on players and what he perceives to be an increased intensity in modern-day soccer.",
      "\u201cYou cannot prove it and the evidence we can provide is very limited in many aspects and every case is very different but already some of them (injuries) we know are based on load and minutes. It's inevitable,\u201d Arteta said Friday. \u201cWe have players who have been injured who have played 130 games over the last two seasons. In the end, it\u2019s an accident waiting to happen if you continue to load and load and load.",
      "\u201cIs this season an accumulation of that? Is it the stress of that? Is it luck? Is it preparation? Is it methodology? There are a lot of factors. It\u2019s very difficult to point at something but the schedule that's planned is super-demanding and for certain players, especially explosive players, it\u2019s a real issue.\u201d",
      "Havertz appears to have been unlucky in picking up his injury, with Arteta explaining how the German stretched his leg to stop a shot at a set-piece and \u201cfelt his hamstring go.\u201d",
      "Given the number of injuries sustained by Arsenal players this season \u2014 others to have had long spells out include Ben White, Martin Odegaard, Riccardo Calafiori and Takehiro Tomiyasu \u2014 some have questioned whether Arteta\u2019s training methods are to blame.",
      "Maybe that was the reason why Arteta was eager to point out that Arsenal\u2019s players now \u201ctrain less than ever\u201d and go into a deeper explanation about how too many games \u2014 and, as a result, not enough training \u2014 affects players\u2019 recovery.",
      "\u201cThe muscle is undertrained and then you expose the muscle and the tendon to an exposure that they cannot absorb because the tendon needs 72 hours to recover,\u201d Arteta said. \u201cA lot of people talk about what we're doing outside. It\u2019s not outside, it\u2019s inside.",
      "\u201cWhen you have to load that muscle for two or three or six or eight weeks that you haven\u2019t in training, the risk of injury is much bigger \u2014 one, because the tendon is not recovered, and then it\u2019s not prepared to absorb the load and stress you are going to put it under every three days.\u201d",

In each one, between seven and up to 46 different pesticide residues were identified, of which an average of almost 12 were deemed hazardous because they are possibly carcinogenic or endocrine disrupting, the group said.

      "Fares had been working in three clinics run by M\u00e9decins du Monde, or Doctors of the World, offering free health care to the displaced population in northern Syria, which until the fall of former President Bashar Assad in December had been the country's main rebel-held enclave. It sheltered millions of people who had fled years of civil war.",

      "\u201cIf the support is not resumed, there will be a major disaster and serious harm to vulnerable groups,\u201d said Fares, who heads the organization\u2019s medical programs. \u201cOperating costs of clinics are much lower than those of hospitals.

      "The Republican-controlled chamber approved the measure in a 59-10 vote and sent it to the Senate, despite concerns from some gun violence prevention advocates that it places an unnecessary burden on children.",
      "Under the proposal, public school students would receive mandatory instruction throughout their K-12 years on how to respond if they encounter a gun. The lessons, which could be presented in a video or by an instructor displaying an actual firearm, would demonstrate best practices for safely handling and storing a gun to prevent accidents.",
      "Elementary age children would learn about gun safety on at least three occasions by the time they reach sixth grade, with the possibility for that instruction to begin in kindergarten, when kids are around five years old.",
      "The bill\u2019s Republican sponsor, Rep. Rex Shipp of Cedar City, said it's aimed at preventing accidental shootings by and of young children. The lessons, he said, will be age-appropriate for each grade level, with younger students learning to avoid touching a gun and alert an adult immediately.",
      "\u201cA lot of times when they don't have any firearms in their homes or don't do any hunting and shooting, then these kids are not taught what to do when they come in contact with a firearm,\u201d Shipp said.",
      "One other state, Tennessee, has a law on the books requiring firearm safety training in public schools, but it lets education officials determine in which grade they think it's appropriate for students to start receiving that instruction. The lessons, set to begin next school year, will be annual and cannot include live firearms or ammunition.",
      "A Utah statute already allows firearm safety to be taught in schools, but Shipp said teachers don't currently do so. His bill makes it mandatory but allows parents to opt their kids out of the instruction.",
      "If it passes the similarly Republican-led Senate and is signed into law, the lessons would begin next school year.",
      "Gun violence prevention advocates have applauded Utah Republicans for pushing for more gun safety education, but some argue those lessons should be aimed at adults.",
      "The proposal unfairly places the responsibility of gun safety on children rather than their parents, said Barbara Gentry of the Gun Violence Prevention Center of Utah.",

      "ALBANY, N.Y. -- A Texas judge on Thursday fined a New York doctor for prescribing abortion pills to a woman near Dallas in one of the first challenges in the U.S. to \u201cshield laws\u201d enacted in Democratic-controlled states where abortion is legal.",
      "The ruling was handed down on the same day New York Gov. Kathy Hochul rejected a request from Louisiana to extradite the same doctor, Dr. Maggie Carpenter, who was charged in that state with prescribing abortion pills to a pregnant minor.",
      "Unlike Louisiana, Texas did not file criminal charges against Carpenter but accused her in a December lawsuit of violating state law by prescribing abortion medication via telemedicine. Texas has one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the nation.",
      "State District Judge Bryan Gantt issued a $100,000 fine against Carpenter and ordered her to pay attorney\u2019s fees.",
      "Earlier Hochul, a Democrat, said she will not honor Louisiana's request to arrest and send the doctor to Louisiana after she was charged with violating the southern state's strict anti-abortion law.",
      "\u201cI will not be signing an extradition order that came from the governor of Louisiana,\u201d Hochul said at a news conference in Manhattan. \u201cNot now, not ever.\u201d",
      "She also said she sent out a notice to law enforcement in New York that instructed them to not cooperate with out-of-state warrants for such charges.",
      "The case against Carpenter appears to be the first instance of criminal charges against a doctor accused of prescribing abortion pills to another state.",
      "Pills have become the most common method of abortion in the U.S. and are at the epicenter of political and legal fights over abortion access following the U.S. Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade.",
      "The showdown between New York and Louisiana over Carpenter is expected to result in a court case that could test New York's so-called shield law, which gives legal protections to doctors who prescribe abortion medication to conservative states where abortions are banned or otherwise limited. Other Democratic-controlled states have similar shield laws.",
      "Prosecutors in West Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, indicted Carpenter on charges that she violated the state's near-total abortion ban, which allows physicians convicted of performing abortions, including one with pills, to be sentenced up to 15 years in prison.",
      "Louisiana authorities said the girl who received the pills experienced a medical emergency and had to be transported to the hospital. The girl's mother was also charged and has turned herself in to police.",
      "In a videotaped statement Thursday, Republican Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said \u201cthere is only one right answer in this situation, and it is that that doctor must face extradition to Louisiana where she can stand trial and justice will be served.\u201d",
      "Landry's office did not immediately return an emailed request for comment sent after Hochul refused the extradition request."

He is due to be hanged on Thursday, making him the fourth person to be put to death in the Southeast Asian country this year alone; two others were executed for drug-related crimes and one for murder.",

      "Pannir's family, lawyers, some Malaysian lawmakers and various rights groups noted that the Singapore court had found that he was merely a courier transporting the substance. The 36-year-old has said he didn't know he was carrying drugs. Still, the court had to hand down the death sentence after prosecutors refused to issue Pannir a certificate of substantive assistance, vouching that he helped their investigation, which would have spared him the noose, they said.",
      "\"This process violates the right to a fair trial, as it placed the decision between a life-or-death sentence in the hands of the prosecution\u2013which is not a neutral party in the trial,\u201d Amnesty International said. \u201cWe urge the Singapore government to immediately end its unlawful resort to the death penalty and immediately establish a moratorium on all executions.\"",
      "Malaysian lawmakers called on their country to intervene to halt Pannir's execution and have him extradited to facilitate further investigation.",

      "\u201cWe oppose the use of the death penalty on drug mules who are themselves victims in the million-dollar transactions by syndicates that are roaming free,\u201d Malaysian lawmaker Ram Karpal Singh was quoted as saying by The Star newspaper.",
      "Pannir, the third of six children, is the son of a church pastor who worked as a lorry driver to make ends meet, said Singapore anti-death penalty activist Kokila Annamalai. He loves music and played in the church choir growing up, she said.",
      "Behind bars, Pannir has written letters, songs and poems about the anguish of being on death row and hopes of a second chance, she said. His family has shared some of his songs, which were replicated by several Malaysian singers.",
      "Activists in Malaysia will hold a vigil outside the Singapore High Commission in Kuala Lumpur later Wednesday. Another vigil will be held simultaneously at a park in Singapore to protest Pannir\u2019s execution and the death penalty, as well as to remember those hanged by the city-state."

      "During that war, 700,000 Palestinians fled or were forced from their homes in what is now Israel. That Nakba, or \u201ccatastrophe,\u201d as Palestinians call it, gave rise to the crowded West Bank towns now under assault and still known as refugee camps.",
      "\u201cThis is our nakba,\u201d said Abed Sabagh, 53, who bundled his seven children into the car on Feb. 9 as sound bombs blared in Nur Shams camp, where he was born to parents who fled the 1948 war.",
      "Humanitarian officials say they haven\u2019t seen such displacement in the West Bank since the 1967 Mideast war, when Israel captured the territory west of the Jordan River, along with east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, displacing another 300,000 Palestinians.",
      "\u201cThis is unprecedented. When you add to this the destruction of infrastructure, we\u2019re reaching a point where the camps are becoming uninhabitable,\" said Roland Friedrich, director of West Bank affairs for the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency. More than 40,100 Palestinians have fled their homes in the ongoing military operation, according to the agency.",
      "Experts say that Israel's tactics in the West Bank are becoming almost indistinguishable from those deployed in Gaza. Already, President Donald Trump's plan for the mass transfer of Palestinians out of Gaza has emboldened Israel's far-right to renew calls for annexation of the West Bank.",
      "\"The idea of \u2018cleansing\u2019 the land of Palestinians is more popular today than ever before,\" said Yagil Levy, head of the Institute for the Study of Civil-Military Relations at Britain\u2019s Open University.",
      "The Israeli army denies issuing evacuation orders in the West Bank. It said troops secure passages for those wanting to leave on their own accord.",
      "Over a dozen displaced Palestinians interviewed in the last week said they did not flee their homes out of fear, but on the orders of Israeli security forces. Associated Press journalists in the Nur Shams camp also heard Israeli soldiers shouting through mosque megaphones, ordering people to leave.",
      "Some displaced families said soldiers were polite, knocking on doors and assuring them they could return when the army left. Others said they were ruthless, ransacking rooms, waving rifles and hustling residents out of their homes despite pleas for more time.",
      "\u201cI was sobbing, asking them, \u2018Why do you want me to leave my house?\u2019 My baby is upstairs, just let me get my baby please,\u2019\u201d Ayat Abdullah, 30, recalled from a shelter for displaced people in the village of Kafr al-Labd. \u201cThey gave us seven minutes. I brought my children, thank God. Nothing else.\"",
      "Told to make their own way, Abdullah trudged 10 kilometers (six miles) on a path lighted only by the glow from her phone as rain turned the ground to mud. She said she clutched her children tight, braving possible snipers that had killed a 23-year-old pregnant woman just hours earlier on Feb. 9.",
      "Her 5-year-old son, Nidal, interrupted her story, pursing his lips together to make a loud buzzing sound.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re right, my love,\" she replied. \u201cThat\u2019s the sound the drones made when we left home.\u201d",
      "In the nearby town of Anabta, volunteers moved in and out of mosques and government buildings that have become makeshift shelters \u2014 delivering donated blankets, serving bitter coffee, distributing boiled eggs for breakfast and whipping up vats of rice and chicken for dinner.",
      "Residents have opened their homes to families fleeing Nur Shams and Tulkarem.",
      "\u201cThis is our duty in the current security situation,\u201d said Thabet A\u2019mar, the mayor of Anabta.",
      "But he stressed that the town\u2019s welcoming hand should not be mistaken for anything more.",
      "\u201cWe insist that their displacement is temporary,\u201d he said.",
      "When the invasion started on Feb. 2, Israeli bulldozers ruptured underground pipes. Taps ran dry. Sewage gushed. Internet service was shut off. Schools closed. Food supplies dwindled. Explosions echoed.",
      "Ahmad Sobuh could understand how his neighbors chose to flee the Far\u2019a refugee camp during Israel's 10-day incursion. But he scavenged rainwater to drink and hunkered down in his home, swearing to himself, his family and the Israeli soldiers knocking at his door that he would stay.",
      "The soldiers advised against that, informing Sobuh's family on Feb. 11 that, because a room had raised suspicion for containing security cameras and an object resembling a weapon, they would blow up the second floor.",
      "The surveillance cameras, which Israeli soldiers argued could be exploited by Palestinian militants, were not unusual in the volatile neighborhood, Sobuh said, as families can observe street battles and Israeli army operations from inside.",
      "But the second claim sent him clambering upstairs, where he found his nephew\u2019s water pipe, shaped like a rifle.",
      "Hours later, the explosion left his nephew's room naked to the wind and shattered most others. It was too dangerous to stay.",
      "\u201cThey are doing everything they can to push us out,\u201d he said of Israel's military, which, according to the U.N. agency for refugees, has demolished hundreds of homes across the four camps this year.",
      "The Israeli army has described its ongoing campaign as a crucial counterterrorism effort to prevent attacks like Oct. 7, and said steps were taken to mitigate the impact on civilians.",
      "The first thing Doha Abu Dgehish noticed about her family's five-story home 10 days after Israeli troops forced them to leave, she said, was the smell.",
      "Venturing inside as Israeli troops withdrew from Far'a camp, she found rotten food and toilets piled with excrement. Pet parakeets had vanished from their cages. Pages of the Quran had been defaced with graphic drawings. Israeli forces had apparently used explosives to blow every door off its hinges, even though none had been locked.",
      "Rama, her 11-year-old daughter with Down syndrome, screamed upon finding her doll\u2019s skirt torn and its face covered with more graphic drawings.",
      "AP journalists visited the Abu Dgehish home on Feb. 12, hours after their return.",
      "Nearly two dozen Palestinians interviewed across the four West Bank refugee camps this month described army units taking over civilian homes to use as a dormitories, storerooms or lookout points. The Abu Dgehish family accused Israeli soldiers of vandalizing their home, as did multiple families in Far\u2019a.",
      "The Israeli army blamed militants for embedding themselves in civilian infrastructure. Soldiers may be \u201crequired to operate from civilian homes for varying periods,\" it said, adding that the destruction of civilian property was a violation of the military's rules and does not conform to its values.",
      "It said \u201cany exceptional incidents that raise concerns regarding a deviation from these orders\u201d are \u201cthoroughly addressed,\u201d without elaborating.",
      "For Abu Dgehish, the mess was emblematic of the emotional whiplash of return. No one knows when they\u2019ll have to flee again.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like they want us to feel that we\u2019re never safe,\u201d she said. \u201dThat we have no control.\u201d",

      "Polish prosecutors say they're considering whether to open a criminal investigation into an open-air exhibition in 2022 of damaged Russian military vehicles after one of them was found to contain live explosives",
      "WARSAW, Poland -- Prosecutors in Poland said Tuesday they are considering whether to open a criminal investigation into an open-air exhibition in 2022 of damaged Russian military vehicles after one of them was found to contain live explosives.",
      "The exhibits \u2014 a damaged T-72 tank, a self-propelled howitzer and elements of Russian missile systems \u2014 were brought to Poland from the battlefields in Ukraine a few months after the full-scale Russian invasion in February 2022.",
      "Live grenades and ammunition were found inside one of the exhibits during stocktaking and had apparently been there ever since their battles in Ukraine. Since the exhibition, the military vehicles have been held in secure storage.",
      "The vehicles were brought to Poland by the previous government, which was voted out at the end of 2023. The stocktaking was ordered by the new management of the Government Agency of Strategic Reserves appointed by the current government.",
      "The agency filed a notice this month with prosecutors in Warsaw, seeking a criminal investigation into those responsible for failing to carry out proper security checks on the vehicles.",
      "\u201cImagination is suggesting what could have happened if there was a tragic development\u201d and an explosion, Jan Jalowczyk of the strategic reserve agency told The Associated Press. \u201cThere were huge numbers of people at these exhibitions, families with children.\u201d",
      "Endangering public security carries a prison sentence of up to eight years. Sappers have secured, rather than neutralized the explosives in case of an investigation.",
      "The exhibition \u201cFor Our Freedom and Yours\u201d was organized by Poland\u2019s previous government, jointly with Ukrainian authorities, with the intention of boosting Ukraine\u2019s morale by showing that Russia, which had attacked months earlier, could be defeated. It was shown in Warsaw, Poznan, Gdansk and during a military equipment fair in Kielce. There were plans to show it in Brussels.",
      "The prosecutors are also checking allegations that under the previous management the agency wrongly spent some 700 million zlotys ($176 million) on having the vehicles transported across Poland, while transport is not within its mandate."

      "Cambodian lawmakers have approved a bill that will toughen penalties for anyone denying that atrocities were carried out in the late 1970s under the rule of the Khmer Rouge, whose brutal policies are blamed for the deaths of 1.7 million people",
      "PHNOM PENH, Cambodia -- Cambodian lawmakers on Tuesday unanimously approved a bill that will toughen penalties for anyone denying that atrocities were carried out in the late 1970s under the rule of the communist Khmer Rouge, whose brutal policies are blamed for the deaths of 1.7 million people.",
      "A statement issued by the National Assembly said that all 115 members voted in favor of the law, which was said to be intended to prevent the recurrence of such events and to provide justice for victims of the Khmer Rouge.",
      "The seven-article bill makes violation of its terms punishable by up to five years in prison and a fine of between $2,500 and $125,000.",
      "In 2013 Cambodia enacted a similar law against denying Khmer Rouge atrocities after then-Prime Minister Hun Sen called for the measure. He claimed that a leading opposition lawmaker suggested that some of the evidence of Khmer Rouge atrocities was fabricated by Vietnam. That law prescribed prison terms of six months to two years and fines of up to $1,000.",
      "Critics charged that the measure then was a veiled attempt to undermine his political opponents and allege that the latest proposed legal change has a similar motive.",
      "The latest National Assembly statement said the draft law is designed to punish individuals who do not recognize, or deny or object to the recognition of crimes that were proven in legal proceedings held by a U.N.-backed tribunal to have been committed under the Khmer Rouge.",
      "The tribunal, which held a series of trials starting in 2009, found that the Khmer Rouge government committed genocide, crimes against humanity and grave breaches of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, in addition to severe violations of Cambodian criminal law, international humanitarian law and various international conventions recognized by Cambodia.",
      "The new law\u2019s adoption comes two months ahead of the 50th anniversary of the Khmer Rouge takeover of Cambodia on April 15, 1975 after five years of civil war.",
      "The bill will now be sent to the senate for approval, a pro forma action, and will become effective when it is signed by King Norodom Sihamoni.",
      "The Khmer Rouge, under the leadership of the late Pol Pot, stayed in power until 1979 when it was ousted by an invasion from neighboring Vietnam. Its radical policies while in power are thought to have been responsible for an estimated 1.7 million deaths from starvation, execution, and illness.",
      "Aside from the few surviving senior leaders of the Khmer Rouge and other aging veterans of their movement, few Cambodians who lived through those times would deny that the Khmer Rouge were responsible for severe human rights violations on a massive scale.",
      "In May 2024, Hun Sen \u2014 who himself had been a middle-ranking commander with the Khmer Rouge before defecting \u2014 suggested that the 2013 law needed to be updated. His government was noted for intimidating its opponents through the courts, which are widely seen by rights groups as allies of the ruling party.",
      "Hun Sen, who in 2023 was succeeded as prime minister by his son, Hun Manet, claimed that his political opponents could instigate a \u201ccolor revolution\u201d \u2014 similar to uprisings that had taken place in Ukraine and other former Soviet states \u2014 that could lead to a genocidal war in Cambodia, evoking the Khmer Rouge atrocities.",
      "Hun Sen was prime minister for 38 years and still wields significant political power as Senate president and head of the Cambodian People\u2019s Party."

      "The statement by Pyongyang\u2019s Foreign Ministry came after the top diplomats of the U.S., South Korea and Japan met at a security conference in Germany and reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening military cooperation and reinforcing an international sanctions regime to counter Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear ambitions.",
      "The North Korean ministry accused the U.S. of trying to realize an \u201coutdated and absurd plan\u201d of denuclearizing the North and warned of \u201coverwhelming and decisive counteraction\u201d against its rivals if it perceives its security is under threat.

      "U.S. Secretary of State Mark Rubio held a three-way meeting with the South Korean and Japanese foreign ministers in Munich, Germany, on Saturday and reaffirmed their commitment to the North\u2019s \u201ccomplete denuclearization\u201d and maintaining an effective sanctions regime targeting the country\u2019s weapons program. The countries also agreed to bolster defense and deterrence, including by expanding three-way military exercises and strengthening Japan and South Korea's military capabilities, according to a joint statement released after the meeting.",
      "Trump and Kim met three times in 2018 and 2019 during Trump\u2019s first term, but their diplomacy quickly collapsed over disagreements about exchanging the release of U.S.-led sanctions for North Korean steps to wind down its nuclear and missile programs. North Korea has since suspended any meaningful talks with Washington and Seoul as Kim ramped up his testing activity and military demonstrations to counter what he portrayed as \u201cgangster-like U.S. threats.\u201d",
      "Kim\u2019s foreign policy priority is now Russia, which he has supplied with weapons and troops to help prolong Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Seoul fears that Kim may receive economic assistance and advanced technology to develop his arsenal in exchange for its military supporting Russia.",
      "The North\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency said a diplomatic delegation led by Kim Ik Song, director of the Bureau for Affairs with Diplomatic Corps, departed for Russia on Monday in the latest diplomatic activity between the countries. The agency didn\u2019t specify what will be discussed during the meetings.",
      "Trump\u2019s election win has touched off speculation about a possible resumption of summit-driven diplomacy with Kim, but analysts say a quick return to 2018 is unlikely, given the significant changes in the regional security situation and broader geopolitics since then.",
      "North Korea\u2019s nuclear program is no longer an independent issue but connected with broader challenges created by Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine and further complicated by weakened sanctions enforcement against Pyongyang.",
      "Kim\u2019s efforts to boost North Korea\u2019s presence in a united front against Washington could also gain strength if Trump\u2019s efforts to increase tariffs and reset global trade rekindles a trade war with China, the North\u2019s main ally and economic lifeline, according to some experts.",

      "The Vatican says Pope Francis slept peacefully and ate breakfast after developing pneumonia in both his lungs",
      "ROME -- Pope Francis slept well and ate breakfast Wednesday, the Vatican said, after he developed pneumonia in both lungs in a further complication in the condition of the 88-year-old pontiff that raised concerns about his ability to fight off the infection.",
      "In an early update Wednesday morning, a Vatican spokesman said Francis spent his fifth night in Rome's Gemelli hospital peacefully. \u201cHe had a tranquil night, woke up and had breakfast,\u201d he said.",
      "The Vatican on Tuesday confirmed the pneumonia and said Francis\u2019 respiratory infection also involves asthmatic bronchitis, which requires the use of cortisone antibiotic treatment. \u201cLaboratory tests, chest X-ray, and the Holy Father\u2019s clinical condition continue to present a complex picture,\u201d the Vatican said.",
      "Nevertheless the pope, who had the upper lobe of his right lung removed as a young man, is in good spirits and is grateful for the prayers for his recovery, Bruni said in a late update.",
      "Francis was admitted to the Gemelli hospital in a \u201cfair\u201d condition on Friday after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. On Monday, medical personnel determined that he was suffering from a polymicrobial respiratory tract infection, meaning a mix of viruses, bacteria and possibly other organisms had colonized in his respiratory tract.",
      "\u201cThe follow-up chest CT scan which the Holy Father underwent this afternoon ... demonstrated the onset of bilateral pneumonia, which required additional drug therapy,\u201d Bruni said.",
      "Bronchitis can lead to pneumonia, which is a deeper and far more serious infection of the lungs\u2019 air sacs. Pneumonia can develop in part of one lung or an entire lung or both lungs. It tends to be more serious when both lungs are affected because there isn\u2019t healthy lung tissue to compensate.",
      "Treatment varies by severity but can include providing oxygen through a nasal tube or mask, intravenous fluids \u2014 and treatment of the underlying cause of the infection. To date Francis is not known to be using supplemental oxygen, and he has eaten breakfast every day, read the newspapers and done some work from his hospital room.",
      "The Vatican hasn't provided any information about how Francis is responding to any of the drugs he has been given other than to say he isn't running a fever.",
      "Dr. Carmelo D\u2019Asero, an infectious disease and geriatric disease expert in Rome, said Francis' lack of a fever was not necessarily a positive thing, given the seriousness of his infection.",
      "\u201cA high fever is a sign of an immune response to a pathogen,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving a low fever and having a serious bronchial infection ... is a sign of a decreased immune response and that makes us worry a little bit more, let\u2019s say. Maybe if he had a fever, it would have been better.\u201d",
      "The Vatican has given no indication of how long the pope might remain hospitalized, only saying that the treatment of such a \u201ccomplex clinical picture,\u201d which has already required several changes in his drug regimen, would require an \u201cadequate\u201d stay.",
      "Despite the less than positive news about Francis' condition, a rainbow appeared over the Gemelli hospital on Tuesday afternoon and Francis received get-well drawings and cards from children being treated in the hospital's oncology ward.",

      "A Japanese court has convicted a man who threw a homemade pipe bomb at Japan's former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida at a 2023 campaign event, sentencing him to 10 years in prison",
      "TOKYO -- A Japanese court on Wednesday convicted a man who threw a homemade pipe bomb at Japan's former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida at a 2023 campaign event, sentencing him to 10 years in prison, court officials said.",
      "Ryuji Kimura, 25, was found guilty of attempted murder in the April 15, 2023 attack on Kishida at a small fishing port in the western city of Wakayama, as well as four other crimes including violations of laws on explosives and other weapons.",
      "At stake was whether Kimura intended to commit murder.",
      "The Wakayama District Court said in the ruling that Kimura was aware of the potential for a fatality in his attack, according to the Kyodo News agency. The ruling said the attack at an election campaign event was a serious challenge to democracy and posed a significant danger to many people, Kyodo said.",
      "Kimura, at an opening session of the trial in early February, pleaded not guilty to attempted murder, saying he didn\u2019t intend to kill Kishida. He said he was dissatisfied with Japan\u2019s election system and that he only wanted to get public attention by targeting a famous politician.",
      "The then-prime minister was unhurt, but two people sustained minor injuries. Kimura was arrested on the spot.",
      "The attack came about a year after the assassination of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during a campaign speech in Nara, another city in western Japan.",
      "Prosecutors said Kimura had a murder intent, noting that the bomb Kimura threw at Kishida was potentially lethal, and demanded a 15-year prison term.",
      "Gun-related crime is rare in Japan because of strict gun control laws, but there has been a series of high-profile knifings and other attacks using homemade guns and explosives.",

      "They\u2019re known as \u201cfrog men,\u201d inmates who are forced to sleep on prison floors across the Dominican Republic, often next to overflowing toilets or holes in the ground that serve as one",
      "SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic -- They\u2019re known as \u201cfrog men,\u201d inmates who are forced to sleep on prison floors across the Dominican Republic, often next to overflowing toilets or holes in the ground that serve as one.",
      "Thousands of them are crammed into the country\u2019s severely overcrowded prisons, some operating at seven times their capacity. A majority languish there without ever having been charged with a crime, and activists warn they face inhuman conditions and a lack of medical care.",
      "Despite promises to improve the system, critics say the Dominican Republic continues to push for and allow pretrial detentions in nearly all criminal cases where no charges have been filed and has made few changes as problems within prisons keep mounting.",
      "\u201cPrisons have become no man\u2019s land,\u201d said Rodolfo Valent\u00edn Santos, director of the Dominican Republic\u2019s National Public Defense Office.",
      "Over 60% of the country\u2019s roughly 26,000 inmates are being held under preventive detention, without any charges, according to the National Public Defense Office. Proponents argue the measure aims to protect society and allows authorities time to collect evidence in a case.",
      "But some detainees have spent up to 20 years in prison without ever being found guilty of a crime, Valent\u00edn said.",
      "He noted that the country\u2019s Constitution and penal code dictate that preventive detention is an \u201cexceptional\u201d measure. There are six other measures that don\u2019t involve prison time, including bail, but Valent\u00edn said they are rarely used.",
      "On a recent afternoon, Darwin Lugo and Yason Guzm\u00e1n walked out of La Victoria National Penitentiary, in the northeast corner of the sprawling capital, Santo Domingo.",
      "The prison was built for a maximum of 2,100 inmates but holds more than 7,000 of them, with more than 3,300 under pretrial detention, according to the National Public Defense Office.",
      "It is the country\u2019s oldest and most populated prison.",
      "\u201cYou have to watch out for your life,\u201d said Lugo, who with Guzm\u00e1n visited several friends held there, some under pretrial detention.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of them who are not doing well,\u201d Guzm\u00e1n said of inmates there. \u201cThere\u2019s extreme poverty.\u201d",
      "They said their friends, who have spent more than five years incarcerated there, are well-connected and only occasionally request money or ask that their cell phone\u2019s SIM card be recharged.",
      "Last year, at least 11 inmates died at La Victoria following a short circuit in a cell that sparked a fire and an explosion. It was one of the country\u2019s deadliest prison fires since 2005, when at least 134 inmates were killed in the eastern town of Hig\u00fcey after rival gangs set their bedding ablaze.",
      "After last year\u2019s fire at La Victoria, Dominican President Luis Abinader appointed former prisons director Roberto Santana as head of a commission tasked with overhauling and improving the country\u2019s more than 40 prisons.",
      "\u201cWe must admit, gentlemen, that we have a situation in all of the country\u2019s prisons,\u201d Abinader said when he announced the appointment last March. He also announced that money recovered from corruption cases would help fund construction of new prisons.",
      "Santana has long called for the closure of La Victoria and the 15 de Azua prison, located in the country\u2019s western region. The commission he leads is working on those and other monumental tasks, free from outside interference, he said.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t take orders from politicians or anyone else,\u201d said Santana, who previously trained staff for the new prisons built in the early 2000s.",
      "Santana, who once served as president of the Federation of Dominican Students in the 1970s, was arrested multiple times under President Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer, known for having political opponents and dissidents jailed and sometimes killed.",
      "Santana knows first-hand the conditions of La Victoria \u2014 he spent two years in solitary confinement there.",
      "In the early 2000s, the Dominican Republic began building 21 new prisons to improve conditions. They were staffed by trained personnel, not police and soldiers, which oversee the country's other 19 prisons.",
      "But conditions in the new prisons have deteriorated, according to the Dominican Republic's National Commission of Human Rights.",
      "\u201cThe Dominican Republic\u2019s prison system is on the brink of collapse,\u201d the commission said in its 2023 report, the latest one available.",
      "In prisons across the country, overcrowding is rampant. Cells lack bathrooms, natural light and ventilation, leading to worsening health conditions. Some 5,000 inmates are ill with conditions ranging from heart problems to cancer to HIV, but they receive only the most basic medication, if that, and some prisons have no medical staff, according to Valent\u00edn, whose office issues a yearly in-depth report on the conditions of all prisons.",
      "In its 2023 report, the latest year available, his office called for the closure of prisons including one in the north coastal city of Nagua.",
      "\u201cThe level of overcrowding\u2026makes it impossible to achieve true rehabilitation for the inmates since they have been forgotten by the state,\u201d the report read. \u201cIn the conditions they are in, it is obvious that they are treated as objects and not as human beings endowed with rights.\u201d",
      "Another prison was so overcrowded that the government held inmates outdoors in trucks with metal roofs that broiled under the sun, sparking lawsuits, Valent\u00edn said.",
      "A spokesperson for Col. Roberto Hern\u00e1ndez Basilio, director of prisons, did not respond to requests for an interview. Hern\u00e1ndez has previously said his office is taking measures to improve conditions.",
      "Meanwhile, Dominican Attorney General Miriam Germ\u00e1n Brito has repeatedly spoken out against pretrial detention but noted that the decision lies in the hands of judges. A spokesperson for Germ\u00e1n said she is not granting media interviews.",
      "Both Santana and Valent\u00edn said they believe government corruption is one reason the country has dragged its feet in overhauling the system, accusing soldiers and police who run prisons of benefiting from illegal activities.",
      "Public corruption also prompted authorities to halt construction of a much-touted prison in recent years that was expected to ease overcrowding.",
      "Even as that half-built prison wastes away, Santana said he expects that 25 new prisons capable of holding more than 20,000 inmates will be built by 2028.",
      "While those are expected to help ease overcrowding, concerns remain. Activists note that inmates are not freed even when a judge has legally released them.",
      "The National Commission of Human Rights noted that roughly 2,700 inmates are still in prison because their paperwork is paralyzed in backlogged courts. Meanwhile, hundreds of others remain incarcerated despite being officially freed because they owe the government money and are unable to pay fines ordered by a judge.",

      "The Reserve Bank of Australia reduced the cash rate by a quarter percentage point from 4.35% to 4.1% at its first board meeting for the year.",
      "The cut was widely anticipated after inflation rose only 0.2% in the December quarter and 2.4% for calendar 2024. Annual inflation peaked at 7.8% two years earlier.",
      "The bank manipulates interest rates to keep inflation within a target band of between 2% and 3%.",
      "\u201cInflation has fallen substantially since the peak in 2022, as higher interest rates have been working to bring aggregate demand and supply closer towards balance,\u201d the board said in a statement.",
      "Bank Governor Michele Bullock later advised against believing economic forecasts that several more rate cuts were expected this year. The board will next consider changing interest rates at its meeting on April 1.",
      "\u201cSome other central banks have cut interest rates quite sharply over the past year, but we have taken a different strategy to most,\u201d Bullock told reporters.",
      "\u201cOur policy rate was not raised as much as many countries overseas. We judged that while inflation expectations remained anchored, we could take a bit longer to bring inflation back to the target band, but we could keep unemployment lower,\u201d she added.",

      "Treasurer Jim Chalmers welcomed the independent board's decision.",
      "\u201cThis is the rate relief Australians need and deserve,\u201d Chalmers said in a statement. \u201cIt won't solve every problem in our economy or in household budgets but it will help.\"",
      "Chalmers said his government had curbed inflation without the negative consequences experienced in other countries including of high unemployment, a shrinking economy and recession.",
      "Twelve of the last 13 rate increases have taken place since the government was elected for its first three-year term on May 21, 2022.",
      "The cycle began in the final days of the previous government\u2019s tenure when the rate rose from a record low 0.1% to 0.35% on May 4, 2022.",
      "The high cost of living and a shortage of housing around Australia are expected to be major issues in the upcoming election campaign.",
      "The central bank had held the cash rate at 4.35% since November 2023. That was the highest rate since it fell from 4.5% to 4.25% in December 2011."

      "More than 40% of the migrants, authorities say, won\u2019t voluntarily return to their homeland. Migrants in the hotel rooms held messages to the windows reading \u201cHelp\u201d and \u201cWe are not save (sic) in our country.\u201d",
      "The migrants hailed from 10 mostly Asian countries, including Iran, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Afghanistan, China and others.

      "Abrego said that 171 of the 299 deportees have agreed to return voluntarily to their respective countries with help from the International Organization for Migration and the U.N. Refugee Agency. U.N. agencies are talking with the other 128 migrants in an effort to find a destination for them in third countries. Abrego said that one deported Irish citizen has already returned to her country.",

      "TOKYO -- Japan's government adopted on Tuesday new decarbonization targets aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 70% from 2013 levels over the next 15 years, approving a renewed energy plan to help meet the goal.",
      "This is part of an updated climate plan expected to help the country achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.",
      "Here is what to know about the Japanese climate goals:",
      "Under the new climate plan adopted by the Cabinet, Japan aims to reduce carbon emissions by 60% by 2035 from the 2013 levels, and by 73% by 2040. Japan has previously set a 46% reduction target for 2030.",
      "The goals are known as a Nationally Determined Contribution, or NDC, under the Paris Agreement, and will be submitted to the United Nations.",
      "The 2035 target for Japan, still struggling to reduce its fossil fuel reliance has faced criticism from environmental groups because it is still 6 points short of the reduction needed to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels under the Paris Agreement.",
      "The plan replaces the current version set in 2021 and calls for bolstering renewables up to half of electricity needs by 2040 while maximizing the use of nuclear power to accommodate the growing power demand in the era of AI while meeting decarbonization targets.",
      "It marks an end to Japan's nuclear energy phaseout policy adopted after the 2011 meltdown crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant that led to extensive displacement of residents and lingering anti-nuclear sentiment.",
      "The new energy plan says that nuclear power should account for 20% of Japan\u2019s energy supply in 2040 while expanding renewables to 40-50% from nearly 23% and reducing coal-fired power to 30-40% from nearly 70%.",
      "The current plan set a 20-22% target for nuclear energy, 36-38% for renewables, and 41% for fossil fuel, for 2030.",
      "The energy plan places renewables as the main power source and calls for the development of next-generation energy sources, such as solar batteries and portable solar panels.",
      "Difficult, given the slow and cautious pace of screening by the nuclear regulators and persistent safety concerns and opposition by the residents in the neighboring communities. In order to achieve a 20% target, almost all 33 workable reactors need to be restarted. Nuclear energy accounted for just 8.5% of Japan's power supply in 2023, with only 13 reactors currently online.",
      "The plan calls for acceleration of the restarts of reactors that meet the post-Fukushima safety standards and proposes the construction of next-generation reactors \u2014 at plants where existing reactors are being decommissioned.",
      "The International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi was at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant, the world's largest in the country's northcentral prefecture of Niigata on Tuesday, becoming the first IAEA chief to do so.",
      "Grossi was there to ensure the safety of the plant as it prepared to restart two of its seven reactors that had passed the safety test following a series of safeguarding problems.",
      "The government is pushing for a restart under its energy and climate plans, while a restart would also help improve business for the plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, struggling with the massive cost of decommissioning the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi.",
      "A restart is still uncertain because of safety concerns among the residents in the plant's host towns."

      "The ceremony was held at a Cypriot National Guard base that formerly housed a British military hospital where Shoham was born. About 2,200 babies were born in Cypriot internment camps that held some 52,000 survivors, in the aftermath of World War II, over the entire span of their operation of about four years, according to official records.",
      "Shoham says conditions in the camps were so awful \u2013 especially for youngsters \u2013 that the British granted special dispensation to several hundred families with newborns and small children to make the trek in search of a new life. The influx of people making the journey was so big that British authorities tried to halt it.",
      "At the time, ordinary Cypriots, who worked in the camps and sympathized with the plight of the survivors, helped in whatever way they could, says Shoham.",
      "\u201cThe Cypriot workers did many small, yet significant services for the (camp) detainees,\u201d Shoham said addressing the ceremony attendees. \u201cWe will never forget the assistance of the local Cypriots.\u201d",
      "Although the existence of the internment camps in Cyprus isn\u2019t widely known, the 1960 Hollywood historical drama \u201cExodus\u201d starring Paul Newman and Eva Marie Saint shed light on the issue.",
      "\u201cOn their path to their new homeland, Cyprus became a temporary haven for these survivors, offering them security and care in a world that had so often denied them both,\u201d Cypriot Defence Ministry official Anna Aristotelous said during the ceremony.",
      "Israeli Ambassador Oren Anolik called the internment camps \u201ca fundamental link between Israel and Cyprus\u201d that \u201cforged an enduring bond between our peoples.\u201d",
      "One of those Cypriots who aided Jewish survivors was Capt. Paul Rossides who had volunteered as a harbor pilot at Famagusta port to guide refugee-laden ships where they were refueled and restocked.",
      "Capt. Rossides\u2019 daughter Irinoulas Loizou, 87, who also attended the ceremony, recalled the pots of coffee her mother prepared for her dad to keep him alert as he worked through the night piloting the ships in and out of the port.",
      "\u201cMy father was a very courageous man who always offered his help to those in need regardless of the situation or potential risks to himself,\u201d she said.",
      "Loizou said her father\u2019s work earned recognition from Israeli officials including a plaque he was presented with in July 1949 by Ephraim Gilan, the camp commander of the Jewish paramilitary organization the Haganah.",
      "The plaque was inscribed with the words: \u201cIn recognition for outstanding services rendered to the internees of Karaolos and Xylotympou camps during the years 1946-1949.\u201d"

      "The South Pacific country of Cook Islands has unveiled the details of a deal with China to boost cooperation after the pact provoked a rare diplomatic clash with the nation\u2019s chief benefactor, New Zealand, and protests at home",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- The South Pacific country of Cook Islands on Tuesday unveiled the details of a deal with China to boost cooperation on matters including mining seabed minerals, after the pact provoked a rare diplomatic clash with the nation\u2019s chief benefactor, New Zealand, and protests at home.",
      "The public quarrel between New Zealand and Cook Islands \u2014 which share a passport, a military and constitutional ties \u2014 was a victory for Beijing's efforts to woo Pacific leaders and a blow to Western countries\u2019 efforts to counter China\u2019s sway, analysts said.",
      "The deal does not mention joint security initiatives, unlike others China has made with small South Pacific nations. Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown signed it during a visit to Beijing this month. It also gives few details on the partnership such as promised funding from China.",
      "Mihai Sora, director of the Pacific Islands Program at the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank, said the controversy reflected \"an intense geopolitical contest for influence.\u201d",
      "Cook Islands, with a population of 15,000, a tourism economy and a large exclusive economic zone, is a self-governing country in free association with New Zealand, which gives the bulk of development funding. The arrangement promises New Zealand's help with military and foreign affairs.",
      "In return, Cook Islands must consult New Zealand on any matters that could affect Wellington.",
      "Brown\u2019s refusal to show New Zealand officials the text of the China deal ahead of his trip prompted censure from Wellington this month.",
      "And about 400 people protested at the Cook Islands parliament in the capital, Avarua, on Tuesday after Brown returned from China, according to news outlets there. Footage showed demonstrators carrying placards that read \u201cstay connected to New Zealand.\u201d",
      "The strategic partnership for the next five years between Beijing and Avarua was the only document released publicly by Brown, who earlier said he would sign multiple agreements.",
      "The partnership document pledges more funding from China for infrastructure projects and educational scholarships. Cook Islands will help China to secure preferential treatment at regional meetings of Pacific nations.",
      "The deal \u201cdoes not replace our longstanding relationships with New Zealand, Australia and others, but rather complements them, ensuring that we have a diversified portfolio of partnerships,\u201d Brown told parliament on Monday.",
      "Sora, the analyst, said leaders of small island nations who believe they can \u201coutsmart the Goliath policy and operational engines\u201d of Beijing either have more resources than they let on or have \u201cfalse confidence\u201d about their ability to avoid being compromised.",
      "New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters was cautious about endorsing the deal on Tuesday. A spokesperson said the government would review the text before commenting, and urged Brown to publish any other pacts he signed.",
      "\u201cConsultation and transparency must lie at the heart of the New Zealand-Cook Islands relationship,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "Brown has said he did not believe he needed to supply agreements' precise wording.",
      "The pace of China's deals in the Pacific has escalated in recent years as island nations that once recognized Taiwan have switched their diplomatic ties to solely acknowledge Beijing. That leaves Taipei with few remaining allies. Such moves are often followed by bilateral deals pledging cooperation.",
      "Australia and New Zealand, the region\u2019s biggest donors, have security concerns. Some pacts \u2014 including those Beijing signed with Solomon Islands and Kiribati \u2014 have never been publicly shared.",
      "\u201cThe reason that this one has been public I think is for the optics of the diplomatic victory that China can claim in having won over the Cook Islands to this level of intimacy,\u201d Sora said.",
      "This is the second Pacific dispute in a month for New Zealand, which in January said it was reviewing all development funding to Kiribati after Peters\u2019 office said he was snubbed by the island nation\u2019s president ahead of a planned trip.",
      "Taneti Maamau denied he had planned to meet with Peters personally. Kiribati has drawn increasingly close to China since severing diplomatic ties to Taiwan in favor of Beijing in 2019."

      "A judge has approved an emergency plan to keep Britain\u2019s largest water company afloat and averted a possible temporary government takeover",
      "LONDON -- A judge approved an emergency plan Tuesday to keep Britain\u2019s largest water company afloat, averting the possibility of a temporary government takeover.",
      "Thames Water, which serves 16 million customers in and around London, was seeking court approval for about 3 billion pounds ($3.8 billion) in rescue loans to prevent it from being nationalized when it runs out of cash next month.",
      "Justice Thomas Leech ruled in the High Court in London that the company's restructuring proposal was a better alternative for the public than having Thames Water become insolvent and come under government administration, or a competing plan by a small group of investors.",
      "\u201cThere is a public policy in favor of rescuing the Thames Water Group and giving the market a chance to agree a permanent restructuring plan before the government is forced to fund a special administrator,\" Leech said.",
      "Leech gave permission to appeal to the smaller group of creditors who had proposed a plan that they said would be cheaper and a member of Parliament pushing for a government takeover.",
      "Without the funding, Thames Water would run out of money next month, which could force the government to temporarily take the reins. Both the government and Thames Water said water would continue flowing to customers regardless of what happens.",
      "The decision was applauded by Thames Water Chairman Adrian Montague as a \u201csignificant milestone\u201d to strengthen the company's finances.",
      "Thames Water has been the focus of criticism from consumers and politicians who say the company was the author of its own misfortune, paying overly generous dividends to investors and high salaries and bonuses to executives while failing to invest in pipelines, pumps and reservoirs.",
      "Company executives say the fault lies with regulators who kept bills too low for too long, starving the company of the cash it needed to fund improvements.",
      "Thames Water and the industry that manages water and wastewater services have been the subject of nationwide disgust and outrage over rampant sewage spills in rivers and along the coast.",
      "\u201cThis national scandal is a disaster for Thames Water billpayers and the environment,\" said Charles Watson, chairman of River Action, an environmental group. \u201cInstead of recognizing now is the time for a special administration of Thames Water, the decision saddles customers with the responsibility for funding billions of junk-rated debt while its executives, investors and shareholders escape responsibility.\"",
      "Ofwat, which regulates water companies in England and Wales, in December approved a 35% increase in Thames Water\u2019s consumer charges over the next five years. The company argued that bills needed to rise by 53% in order to finance needed projects and provide the financial returns necessary to attract investors.",
      "The company faces massive penalties for sewage discharges, including a fine of more than 100 million pounds ($126 million) by Ofwat in August for failing to manage its wastewater treatment.",
      "Leech had been considering competing proposals to provide credit to the cash-strapped utility \u2014 one from Thames Water and a second supported by a smaller group that claimed the company's plan was too expensive and favored bigger investors. Creditors holding most of the company\u2019s debt backed the company deal.",
      "Critics of the plan said the high interest rate \u2014 9.75% \u2014 would enrich creditors who are making the loans, a point noted by the judge.",
      "\u201cThe costs of finance and adviser fees in the present case are very high. Indeed, they might be described as eye-watering,\u201d Leech said. \u201c50% of the scheduled loans go round in a circle and back into the pockets of the plan creditors.\u201d",
      "Still, Leech said the alternative of government administration, which he said was preferable to the so-called Plan B, wasn't as attractive as the company plan.",
      "Charlie Maynard, a member of Parliament from the Liberal Democrat party who had argued in court for the government takeover, said he planned to appeal the ruling, insisting that the short-term bailout wasn't in the long-term interest.",
      "\u201cThis restructuring is simply throwing good money after bad,\" Maynard said. \u201cThe money from our bills which is being spent on interest repayments is desperately needed to repair water infrastructure, improve customer service and clean up our rivers.\u201d"

His contingency plans in the event of an outage involve an intricate system of purifying wastewater through friendly bacteria and an alarm system to quickly switch to backup power.",
      "But these measures can\u2019t compete with the gigantic, power-guzzling and thirsty data centers being built in Johor. The province is on track to have at least 1.6 gigawatts of data centers at any given moment from nearly nothing in 2019, making it the fastest-growing data center market in Southeast Asia, according to a report published in April.",
      "Data centers are large, windowless buildings filled with racks of computers that need lots of electricity. To prevent overheating, they rely on energy-intensive air conditioning systems using pumped water. Increasingly used by tech companies for running artificial intelligence systems, the power demand from future facilities in Malaysia may rise to over 5 gigawatts by 2035, according to researchers at Malaysia\u2019s Kenanga Investment Bank. This is more than half of Malaysia\u2019s entire renewable capacity in 2023.",
      "Over 95% of the energy available to Malaysia in 2022 was from fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency. The country is now fifth-largest exporter of liquefied natural gas globally. And with planned renewable projects, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said in September that the country was \u201cconfident of a surplus of energy\u201d to fuel large projects and keep exporting.",
      "But Lau doesn't fancy the chances of his homegrown business competing against the foreign-funded behemoths for energy. Even without data centers, Malaysia is susceptible to power interruptions because of storms, including one that lasted 30 minutes last year and killed 300,000 fish, costing Lau over $1 million. He worries that data centers would result in longer outages.",
      "To survive, he is moving to Thailand and already scouting potential locations for a new fish farm.",
      "\u201cBig data center is coming and there is shortage of power,\" he said. \"It\u2019ll be crazy.\u201d",
      "Malaysia is betting that potential economic growth from data centers justifies the risk. Once touted as an Asian tiger on the cusp of becoming rich, its industries shrunk in the late 1990s after the Asian financial crisis. It has since languished in the middle-income trap. Data centers, the government hopes, will modernize its economy and indirectly create thousands of high-paying jobs.",
      "But experts worry that Malaysia, and others like Vietnam, Indonesia and India vying for billion-dollar investments from tech giants, may be overstating data centers' transformative capabilities that also come at a price: Data centers gobble up land, water and electricity while creating far fewer jobs than they promise. Most data centers provide 30 to 50 permanent jobs while the larger ones create 200 jobs at most, according to a report by the American nonprofit Good Jobs First.",
      "Add to this the rapid increase in power and water use and some experts like Sofia Scasserra, who researches digital economies at the Amsterdam-based think tank Transnational Institute, said that tech companies exploiting resources in poorer countries while extracting data from their populations to get rich is akin to \u201cdigital colonialism.\u201d She compared data extraction to silver mining in Bolivia, which enriched colonial Spain but left nothing behind for Latin America.",
      "\u201cThey are extracting data in the same way. Data doesn\u2019t even leave (behind) taxes,\u201d she said.",
      "Indeed, only a small portion of Malaysia's data center capacity is actually for Malaysian users. Through a network of submarine cables that fans out into the world, they service East Asia, China and Europe. And the data centers themselves are run by foreign companies like America\u2019s Equinix and Microsoft as well as Chinese competitor GDS Holdings that works with tech giants like Alibaba.",
      "These data centers are also on the front lines of AI competition between the U.S. and China. Shortly before he left office, U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s administration proposed new rules that would limit exports of advanced AI chips made by U.S. companies like Nvidia, part of a strategy to deprive China and other U.S. adversaries from gaining access to AI technology through data centers in places likes Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Although it\u2019s unclear if the Trump administration will retain the policy, which hasn\u2019t yet taken effect, GDS Holdings saw its stock drop more than 18% on the day of the announcement.",
      "For now, artificial intelligence is driving the hunger for even more data centers, with tech companies seeking out bigger \u2014 and cheaper \u2014 sites worldwide as a part of a \u201cglobal strategy,\u201d said Rangu Salgame, chairman and CEO of Singapore\u2019s Princeton Digital Group, which is building a 170-megawatt site in Johor. Data centers larger than 40 megawatt typically need land the size of seven football fields \u2014 about enough power for 36,000 American homes, according to data center service provider Stream Data Centers.",
      "That\u2019s costly to build in rich nations like the U.S., which over time has built more data centers than any other country but where land comes at a high price. Enter Malaysia, with its inexpensive land, excess power capacity and tax incentives. The country was the fastest growing data center market in Asia Pacific in the first half of 2024, according to global real estate firm Cushman and Wakefield. This makes Malaysia the eighth-largest data center market in terms of operations and the fifth-largest behind China, India, Japan and Australia when accounting for projects already in the pipeline.",
      "Globally Malaysia ranks 14th in terms of operational capacity \u2014 still smaller than Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, Paris and Dublin \u2014 but it is on track to be among the top 10 markets in five to seven years, according to Pritesh Swamy, who heads research on data centers in Asia for the real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield.",
      "\u201cWe are talking about a region that really grew at a pace that nowhere in the world has seen,\u201d Salgame said.",
      "Next door to Malaysia is Singapore, which paused the construction of new data centers in 2019. The moratorium was over concerns that the energy-guzzling infrastructure was straining the tiny country\u2019s limited resources. In 2019, data centers consumed 7% of the total electricity in the city-state that imports both power and water while aiming to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. They have been trying to build data centers sustainably since 2022, when the moratorium ended.",
      "In the meantime, Malaysia has stepped in to fill the void, attracting investments of over $31 billion \u2014 three times the investments for 2023 \u2014 in the first 10 months of 2024, according to research by real estate firm Knight Frank. Johor already has 22 mostly foreign data centers spanning over 21 hectares, according to the research firm Baxtel. That's the equivalent of nearly 40 football fields, although not all of the data centers are operational.",
      "The data centers that are running look anonymous from the outside. But they can be identified by the tell-tale signs of barbed wire fences, CCTV cameras and patrolling security guards. Elsewhere, a thicket of cranes and workers operating construction machinery is transforming the landscape in the sleepy province.",
      "Salgame said that he hoped data centers could accelerate clean energy growth and experts like Putra Adhiguna of the Jakarta-based think tank Energy Shift Institute agreed that this could happen, but warned that the sheer volume of unforeseen, future demand complicates the transition.",
      "\u201cAdd data centers on top of that, it just becomes much more challenging,\u201d he said.",
      "Tropical Malaysia is warmer than the countries that were initially preferred by data centers, including Ireland, and would require more water and power for cooling, said Alex de Vries, the founder of Digiconomist, a research company studying the unintended consequences of digital trends. He said that these companies are moving to new countries after their promises of economic growth were found to be \u201cempty.\" And while new solar or wind farms can be built faster than other forms of energy, data centers need a lot of electricity from the get-go.",
      "\u201cThese big tech companies are trying to distract you from the really simple math,\u201d he said.",
      "Malaysia acknowledges that the energy demand from data centers is \u201csubstantial\u201d but believes that Johor\u2019s rise as a \u201cdata center powerhouse\u201d will make it a \u201ckey player in Southeast Asia\u2019s digital ecosystem,\u201d said Malaysian Investment, Trade and Industry minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz in an email. He added that Malaysia was writing efficiency guidelines for data centers and has a policy to let them buy clean energy directly from producers.",
      "But concerns are rising among residents about potential water shortages in the future \u2014 echoing the concerns of other developing countries like Chile. Malaysia, like much of Southeast Asia, is at risk of extreme weather including drought, according to a 2022 U.N. climate change report. Francis Hutchinson, an analyst at Singapore\u2019s ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, said that Johor has faced recent disruptions and new stressors, like a growing population and water parks to boost tourism, could exacerbate the crisis.",
      "\u201cWater, more than power, is a potential issue,\u201d he said.",

      "The National Council for Energy Policy's approval came in response to an official invitation in 2023. The group includes the 12 members of OPEC, the longstanding group set up to coordinate oil production to stabilize markets, plus 10 more significant oil-producing nations with Russia by far the largest.",
      "Though non-OPEC members agree to cooperate with OPEC nations, Brazil won't have any binding obligation such as production cuts, Mines and Energy Minister Alexandre Silveira said at a news conference. The participation will be limited to the Charter of Cooperation, a permanent forum for OPEC and OPEC+ countries to discuss industry-related issues. The South American country will not participate in decisions.",
      "Silveira called the charter merely \u201ca forum for discussing strategies among oil-producing countries. We should not be ashamed of being oil producers. Brazil needs to grow, develop and create income and jobs.\u201d",
      "President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva began his third term in 2023 touting himself as an environmental defender, and has worked to reduce deforestation in the Amazon rainforest and to protect Indigenous rights.

      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- U.S. tech giants have quietly empowered Israel to track and kill many more alleged militants more quickly in Gaza and Lebanon through a sharp spike in artificial intelligence and computing services. But the number of civilians killed has also soared, along with fears that these tools are contributing to the deaths of innocent people.",
      "Militaries have for years hired private companies to build custom autonomous weapons. However, Israel\u2019s recent wars mark a leading instance in which commercial AI models made in the United States have been used in active warfare, despite concerns that they were not originally developed to help decide who lives and who dies.",
      "The Israeli military uses AI to sift through vast troves of intelligence, intercepted communications and surveillance to find suspicious speech or behavior and learn the movements of its enemies. After a surprise attack by Hamas militants on Oct. 7, 2023, its use of Microsoft and OpenAI technology skyrocketed, an Associated Press investigation found.",
      "The investigation also revealed new details of how AI systems select targets and ways they can go wrong, including faulty data or flawed algorithms. It was based on internal documents, data and exclusive interviews with current and former Israeli officials and company employees.",
      "Israel\u2019s goal after the attack that killed about 1,200 people and took over 250 hostages was to eradicate Hamas, and its military has called AI a \u201cgame changer\u201d in yielding targets more swiftly. Since the war started, more than 50,000 people have died in Gaza and Lebanon and nearly 70% of the buildings in Gaza have been devastated, according to health ministries in Gaza and Lebanon.",
      "\u201cThis is the first confirmation we have gotten that commercial AI models are directly being used in warfare,\u201d said Heidy Khlaaf, chief AI scientist at the AI Now Institute and former senior safety engineer at OpenAI. \u201cThe implications are enormous for the role of tech in enabling this type of unethical and unlawful warfare going forward.\u201d",
      "Among U.S. tech firms, Microsoft has had an especially close relationship with the Israeli military spanning decades.",
      "That relationship, alongside those with other tech companies, stepped up after the Hamas attack. Israel\u2019s war response strained its own servers and increased its reliance on outside, third-party vendors, according to a presentation last year by Col. Racheli Dembinsky, the military\u2019s top information technology officer. As she described how AI had provided Israel \u201cvery significant operational effectiveness\u201d in Gaza, the logos of Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services appeared on a large screen behind her.",
      "The Israeli military\u2019s usage of Microsoft and OpenAI artificial intelligence spiked last March to nearly 200 times higher than before the week leading up to the Oct. 7 attack, the AP found in reviewing internal company information. The amount of data it stored on Microsoft servers doubled between that time and July 2024 to more than 13.6 petabytes \u2014 roughly 350 times the digital memory needed to store every book in the Library of Congress. Usage of Microsoft\u2019s huge banks of computer servers by the military also rose by almost two-thirds in the first two months of the war alone.",
      "Microsoft declined to provide any comment for this story and did not respond to a detailed list of written questions about the cloud and AI services it provides to the Israeli military.",
      "In an expansive statement on its website, the company says \u201crespecting human rights is a core value of Microsoft\u2033 and it is committed \u201cto champion the positive role of technology across the globe.\u201d In its 40-page Responsible AI Transparency Report for 2024, Microsoft pledges to \u201cmap, measure, and manage generative AI risks throughout the development cycle to reduce the risk of harm,\u201d and does not mention its lucrative military contracts.",
      "Advanced AI models are provided through OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, through Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud platform, where they are purchased by the Israeli military, the documents and data show. Microsoft has been OpenAI\u2019s largest investor.",
      "OpenAI said it does not have a partnership with Israel\u2019s military, and its usage policies say its customers should not use its products to develop weapons, destroy property or harm people. About a year ago, however, OpenAI changed its terms of use from barring military use to allowing for \u201cnational security use cases that align with our mission.\u201d",
      "The Israeli military declined to answer detailed written questions from The AP about its use of commercial AI products from American tech companies, but said its analysts use AI-enabled systems to help identify targets and independently examine them together with high-ranking officers to meet international law, weighing the military advantage against the collateral damage.",
      "\u201cThese AI tools make the intelligence process more accurate and more effective,\u201d said an Israeli military statement to the AP. \u201c\u2060They make more targets faster, but not at the expense of accuracy, and many times in this war they\u2019ve been able to minimize civilian casualties.\u201d",
      "Google and Amazon provide cloud computing and AI services to the Israeli military under \u201cProject Nimbus,\u201d a $1.2 billion contract signed in 2021, when Israel first tested out its in-house AI-powered targeting systems. The IDF has used Cisco and Dell server farms or data centers. Red Hat, an independent IBM subsidiary, also has provided cloud computing technologies to the Israeli military, while Palantir Technologies, a Microsoft partner in U.S. defense contracts, has a \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d providing AI systems to help Israel\u2019s war efforts.",

      "Google said it is committed to responsibly developing and deploying AI \u201cthat protects people, promotes global growth, and supports national security.\u201d",
      "The Israel Defense Forces uses Microsoft Azure to compile information gathered through mass surveillance, which it transcribes and translates, including phone calls, texts and audio messages, according to an Israeli intelligence officer who works with the systems. That data can then be cross-checked with Israel\u2019s in-house targeting systems and vice versa.",
      "He said he relies on Azure to quickly search for terms and patterns within massive text troves, such as finding conversations between two people within a 50-page document. Azure also can find people giving directions to one another in the text, which can then be cross-referenced with the military\u2019s own AI systems to pinpoint locations.",
      "The Microsoft data AP reviewed shows that since the Oct. 7 attack, the Israeli military has made heavy use of transcription and translation tools and OpenAI models, although it does not detail which. Typically, AI models that transcribe and translate perform best in English. OpenAI has acknowledged that its popular AI-powered translation model Whisper, which can transcribe and translate into multiple languages including Arabic, can \u202f make up text that no one said, including adding racial commentary and violent rhetoric.",
      "Errors can happen for many reasons involving AI, said Israeli military officers who have worked with the targeting systems and other tech experts. Intercepted phone calls tied to a person\u2019s profile include the time the person called and the names and numbers of those on the call. But it takes an extra step to listen to and verify the original audio, or to see a translated transcript.",

      "For people who already have high-interest-rate debt, having an emergency fund can help guard against resorting to additional high-cost financing in a pinch",
      "Emergency funds are an absolutely crucial aspect of any financial plan, regardless of the life stage or situation.",
      "For people who already have high-interest-rate debt, having an emergency fund can help guard against resorting to additional high-cost financing in a pinch. It also helps you defray unexpected expenses without needing to raid your retirement accounts.",
      "Finally, the big reason to have an emergency fund is to cover your basic costs in case of job loss.",
      "Tally up your essential monthly outlays: housing costs, utilities, food expenses, servicing debt, insurance, and taxes. Don\u2019t include nonessential items that you could live without in a pinch.",
      "Multiply your essential living expenses by three months. This is your absolute minimum savings target for your emergency fund.",
      "From there, you can customize your own emergency-fund amount upward. One of the biggest determinants of emergency-fund size is your career path. Contractors or other workers with lumpy income streams should obviously have bigger cash buffers.",
      "Finally, factor in how much flexibility you have to adjust your expenses downward in a pinch. New graduates who could readily relocate or get roommates can get away with a smaller emergency fund. But if you\u2019re carrying a mortgage, have two car payments, and have children, your emergency fund should be much larger.",
      "Add up the aggregate investments that you hold in your checking and savings accounts, money market accounts and funds, and certificate of deposit accounts, or CDs. Exclude any assets that you have earmarked for other purposes, such as money that you\u2019re saving for a car down payment. Also exclude any cash holdings in your stock or bond mutual funds. This is your current emergency fund.",
      "Subtract the figure from Step 2 (your current emergency fund) from the figure in Step 1 (your target emergency fund). This is how much you need to save at a bare minimum\u2014double this level or more. Setting money aside to hit this savings target should be your main savings priority in the months ahead.",
      "My advice is to use plain-vanilla cash investments: checking and savings accounts, CDs, and money market accounts. Online savings accounts are often one of the highest-yielding cash options; credit unions also frequently offer decent yields.",
      "As you shop for cash options to populate your emergency fund, remember that not every product type is FDIC-insured. Money market mutual funds, for example, do not qualify for FDIC protection though, in practice, they\u2019ve been quite safe. And remember that CDs carry penalties if you need to get your money out prematurely.",
      "Finally, being able to access emergency-fund assets in a pinch is crucial\u2014you don\u2019t want to have to deal with taxes or penalties. For that reason, it\u2019s ideal to maintain your emergency fund outside the confines of your retirement accounts.",
      "However, your Roth IRA can help back up your emergency fund, if need be. While it\u2019s not ideal to use your retirement savings as a piggy bank, you can tap Roth IRA contributions at any time and for any reason.",
      "If you\u2019re a homeowner, it can make sense to augment your emergency fund by setting up a home equity line of credit to use in case of emergency. That way, should you find yourself in a real bind and have to exhaust your emergency fund, you\u2019ll have another safety net in place.",

      "The illegal trade of lion and leopard parts is growing in Senegal and threatening the lion's survival across West Africa",
      "NIOKOLO-KOBA NATIONAL PARK, Senegal -- The morning sun slants through the canopy of Senegal\u2019s Niokolo-Koba National Park as Sgt. Abdou Diouf and his brigade of rangers march in single file, guns at the ready. They scan the brush for signs of poachers, but today, it seems, the only hunters are the lions themselves, their fresh tracks pressed into the sand.",
      "As the sun climbs, a guttural call reverberates across the forest. The rangers pause. \u201cLions,\u201d Diouf says.",
      "Spanning more than 3,500 square miles \u2013 double the size of Rhode Island \u2013 Niokolo-Koba is the last sanctuary in Senegal for lions, which are critically endangered in West Africa. But even here, they find little respite. Driven by deeply rooted beliefs in the mystical powers of animal skin talismans known as \u201cgris-gris,\u201d the illegal trade of lion and leopard parts is growing, according to a new report by wild cat conservation group Panthera.",
      "Panthera\u2019s investigation found lion and leopard parts sold in 80% of markets surveyed, with 63% of artisans reporting increased sales in recent years. For Niokolo-Koba\u2019s lions, the impact has been devastating. Despite enhanced protections that doubled the population to around 35 since 2017, helping delist the park as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in danger, an unsustainable average of two cats are still lost to poachers each year.",
      "The only other place lions are found in West Africa is in the W-Arly-Pendjari Complex, a border region of Benin, Burkina Faso and Niger, and Panthera estimates there are fewer than 250 adults left in the region.",
      "The gris-gris, prescribed by influential religious leaders called marabouts, are crafted from bits of skin with written prayers or Quranic verses sewn inside. They are widely used across Senegal; police don them for protection, wrestlers for strength, politicians for clout. Average citizens wear them to ward off curses that other people may have put on them for a variety of reasons \u2014 matters of romance, perhaps, or jealousy at economic success.",
      "Gris-gris are rooted in traditional African faiths that believe vital powers in animals and nature may be unlocked \u2014 to harm, to heal, or to protect, said Dr. Cheikh Babou, a history professor and expert in West African Islam at the University of Pennsylvania.",
      "With Islam's arrival in West Africa in the eighth century, gris-gris became hybrid objects, melding Quranic verses with the perceived powers of animal parts. \u201cPeople started to drink the Quran, to wear the Quran \u2013 in the same way that they did with animals,\u201d Babou said.",
      "At a market stall in Tambacounda, Ibrahim, a customer who asked that his last name be withheld because the trade of lion parts is illegal, wears several amulets around his waist. Made from hyena, honey badger, goat, fox, jackal, monkey, and lion, each serves a specific purpose. He began wearing them years ago after falling ill; someone had cast a spell on him, he said, so he went to a marabout who prescribed the gris-gris.",
      "\u201cHere in Africa people are very mean,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they see you succeed a little, they will go to the marabout. They don\u2019t want to see you in good health.\u201d",
      "Traditional African societies are very egalitarian, Babou said \u2013 those with wealth are expected to share it. \u201cThose who don\u2019t share break the ethic of communalism. And when you do that, you become a witch.\u201d A gris-gris can offer protection from those looking to retaliate.",
      "Among these protective talismans, lion parts hold particular allure. As the national emblem, the image of the lion adorns everything from the country\u2019s coat of arms to billboard advertisements, and it serves as namesake for the beloved national soccer team, the Lions of Teranga.",
      "\u201cYou cannot prevent a Senegalese person from believing that a lion skin has some kind of power,\u201d said Daouda Ngom, Senegal\u2019s minister of Environment and Ecological Transition.",
      "This demand has given rise to a complex smuggling network that spans the continent. Likely sourced from East and Southern Africa, the skins travel by public bus and truck along clandestine routes through the Sahel region, evading checkpoints and border security on their journey into Senegal, according to Panthera\u2019s report.",
      "\u201cThese are well-established networks,\u201d said Paul Diedhiou, the director of Niokolo-Koba National Park. \u201cDismantling them requires time, strategy and a lot of professionalism.\u201d",
      "Between 2019 and 2024, authorities in Senegal confiscated some 40 lion and leopard skins, according to the Eco Activists for Governance and Law Enforcement (EAGLE) Network, a wildlife law enforcement organization operating across Africa. During that same period, 40 people were arrested for trafficking skins and other parts such as teeth, claws, and skulls.",
      "\u201cThese seizures represent only a fraction of the actual trade,\u201d said C\u00e9cile Bloch, coordinator of EAGLE Senegal. \u201cToday, traffickers cut lion skins into thousands of pieces to cross borders more easily and avoid detection in local markets.\u201d",
      "Since partnering with Niokolo-Koba in 2016, Panthera has helped strengthen security measures. The conservation group tripled the park\u2019s anti-poaching force from 20 to 60 agents, equipping them with vehicles and gear, while investing more than $7 million in infrastructure \u2013 including a ranger base with an airstrip, hundreds of camera traps, and new roads and bridges.",
      "Yet the crisis\u2019 roots run deeper than poaching. At its heart are the marabouts whose gris-gris prescriptions drive the trade. Those involved often see no contradiction between their prescription or purchase of lion parts and their desire to protect the species, the Panthera report found. As one marabout, Cheikh Camara, put it in an interview with The Associated Press: \u201cI prescribe the gris-gris to help people get better. It\u2019s the poaching that\u2019s making the lions go extinct.\u201d",
      "At the park\u2019s headquarters, the scale of the challenge is clear. A storeroom overflows with confiscated skins \u2014 leopards, lions, antelopes, even a crocodile. A rusting phalanx of seized firearms hangs on the wall.",
      "\u201cSometimes the poachers fire at you,\u201d said Diouf, the sergeant. \u201cIt\u2019s very risky.\u201d",
      "Such dangers are compounded by Senegal\u2019s toothless hunting and wildlife laws, which date to 1986. Recent arrests include a Burkinabe man found with leopard and lion parts who was sentenced to just one month in prison, while a Malian trafficker received the same penalty for smuggling leopard skins.",
      "One vendor told AP he can get a little over $3 for a small bit of lion skin that makes a single gris-gris. A belt can go for the equivalent of nearly $80, he said. The Panthera report said an entire lion skin can fetch the equivalent of $1,900 or more.",
      "\u201cThe sentences are too short,\u201d said Ndeye Seck, the head of litigation and armament for the parks department. \u201cWe would like to see the hunting and protection of wildlife codes updated.\u201d",
      "Ngom, the environment minister who assumed his role early last year, said pushing through tougher laws will be a priority for his team.",
      "But the battle to protect Senegal\u2019s lions is as much about culture as enforcement, and lasting change will require rethinking the role of gris-gris in modern Senegalese society, Babou said.",
      "\u201cCulture is very powerful,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil you can convince people that there are more effective tools to achieve your goals, then they will continue to believe in it.\u201d",

      "It\u2019s been a year since one of Britain\u2019s richest men bought into its most famous soccer team and vowed to bring the good times back",
      "MANCHESTER, England -- It's been a year since one of Britain's richest men bought into its most famous soccer team and vowed to bring the good times back.",
      "So far, it hasn't gone to plan for Manchester United or Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "The record 20-time English champion is languishing in the bottom half of the Premier League, losing vast sums of money every year and facing fan unrest.",
      "Even head coach Ruben Amorim said recently that this might be the worst team in the club's storied history.",
      "That's not all on Ratcliffe, the billionaire owner of petrochemicals giant INEOS, but it has been a rocky start since he paid $1.3 billion for an initial 25% stake in United and assumed control of its soccer operations.",
      "There have been high profile hirings and firings, brutal cost cutting, a hike in ticket prices and new lows on the field for a team that had been in decline for more than a decade before he became minority owner.",
      "While there was triumph in the FA Cup last year, that success has been overshadowed by supporter protests, job losses, unconvincing transfers and humbling defeats.",
      "Ratcliffe said his investment was \u201cjust the beginning of our journey to take Manchester United back to the top of English, European and world football.\u201d",
      "Those ambitions feel further away now than they have in decades, with United 15th in the standings and closer to the relegation zone than the top six after a woeful campaign. Sunday's 1-0 loss to Tottenham was the 12th in the league this season and an eighth under Amorim, who only took charge in November.",
      "Amorim said: \u201cI have a lot of problems, my job is so hard, but I am here to continue my job to the next week with my beliefs.\"",
      "He was one of a number of key hires made as part of Ratcliffe's overhaul of United's soccer operations.",
      "Omar Berrada was lured away from Manchester City to become CEO and Dan Ashworth left Newcastle to take up the role of sporting director. Jason Wilcox, formerly director of City's academy, became technical director.",
      "Key figures at Ratcliffe\u2019s Ineos Sport, Dave Brailsford and Jean-Claude Blanc, were appointed to the board and Amorim became the final piece of a new leadership team after former manager Erik ten Hag was fired in October.",
      "But that restructuring has been far from a smooth process.",
      "Ten Hag was fired three months after being handed a one-year contract extension with United having lost four of its opening nine league games.",
      "Ashworth left the club less than six months after taking up his role, and after months of negotiations to take him away from Newcastle.",
      "They were expensive missteps.",
      "In total it cost United 10.4 million pounds ($13.09 million) to pay off Ten Hag and his staff and another 11 million pounds ($13.85 million) to trigger Amorim's release from Sporting Lisbon.",
      "It was reported it cost between 2 and 3 million pounds ($2.5-3.78 million) to hire Ashworth, who spent five months on gardening leave during negotiations with Newcastle.",
      "Those numbers make uncomfortable reading at a time when United has implemented cost-saving initiatives that it said included staff redundancies of around 250 roles. More could be on the way, according to reports.",
      "In October it emerged that managerial great Alex Ferguson was not beyond the reach of those measures. He will step down from his lucrative role as club ambassador at the end of the season.",
      "In addition to cuts, United raised its lowest-priced tickets to 66 pounds ($81) partway through the season, up from 40 pounds ($49).",
      "It defended that decision by telling fans it could not sustain its current financial losses and was in danger of breaching league rules if it did not act. United reported losses last year of 113.2 million pounds ($140 million).",
      "\u201cWe will get back to a cash positive position as soon as possible and we will have to make some difficult choices to get there,\u201d it said in a letter to fans.",
      "That explanation has not gone down well with supporters.",
      "\u201cFans should not be paying the price for previous bad ownership & bad management,\u201d Manchester United Supporters Trust posted on X. \u201cThe supporters bring far more value than the simple collective ticket revenue.\u201d",
      "Supporters spent years trying to drive out the American Glazer family, which is still majority owner, and there continues to be anger towards them after Ratcliffe's investment.",
      "There have been jeers for the team while United's performances on the field have continued to slide.",
      "Ratcliffe's first season as co-owner saw United endure its worst league campaign in 34 years when it finished in eighth place.",
      "The end of his first full season could be even worse.",
      "The last time it lost 12 of its first 25 games in a league season was in the 1973-74 campaign when it was relegated from the top flight.",
      "United has spent around $260 million on players in the two transfer windows under Ratcliffe, but the squad still looks well short of the quality required to challenge for the title.",
      "Forward Joshua Zirkzee has struggled to adapt to the Premier League and defender Leny Yoro missed a large part of the season through injury.",
      "The pressure of complying with the league's financial rules has placed uncertainty on United's ability to spend big in the summer to bring in players to suit Amorim's preferred system, and there is unlikely to be a quick fix.",
      "Ratcliffe wants a world class stadium, either by way of redeveloping United's iconic Old Trafford or building one from new.",
      "His plans, which include an ambitious redevelopment of the surrounding area, have been backed by the U.K. government. Financing them, however, is another issue and it is not yet clear where that money will come from.",
      "The modernization of United's Carrington training ground is well underway after 50 million pounds ($63 million) of investment.",
      "United hasn't lifted the league title since Ferguson's last season in 2013 and behind the scenes the focus is on winning it for a record-extending 21st time. But with Liverpool on course to equal United's haul of 20 this season, it is the club's great rival from Merseyside that could set that new bar first.",
      "Ratcliffe is a hugely successful businessman but, as he is discovering, that does not guarantee success in soccer.",

      "The initial round of grantmaking will support immediate needs like temporary housing, rental assistance, food access, and disaster case management, according to a FireAid statement. Each organization will receive at least $100,000.",

Concert organizers expanded the show to two L.A. venues to accommodate all the artists, and more than 50 million viewers across 28 broadcast channels and streaming platforms watched the six-hour live show.",
      "The benefit concert raised millions through text-to-donate, ticket sales and corporate sponsorships. Los Angeles Clippers owner Steve Ballmer and his wife Connie matched every donation collected during the live broadcast, including a $1 million gift from the band U2.",
      "FireAid organizers, including producers Irving and Shelli Azoff, convened an advisory committee and consulted with representatives from past catastrophes like the 2023 Maui fires before deciding how to distribute the money. A first round of funding to support immediate needs will be followed by future funding for longterm recovery like rebuilding. Applications are also open for smaller grants to community organizations of $10,000-$50,000.",
      "The $50 million announced Tuesday will support community-based groups \u201con the front lines of wildfire relief,\u201d according to the organization. It provides assistance for children and families, displaced workers and small businesses, and students and schools among other categories.",

      "The list includes Project:Camp, an L.A.-based nonprofit that hosts trauma-informed popup camps for children impacted by disasters.",
      "\u201cAs a result of everyone who donated to this fund, Project:Camp was able to help provide more than 10,000 hours of free, trauma-informed care to nearly 1,000 children who were affected by the wildfires,\u201d said Henry Meier, Project:Camp director of external affairs.",
      "A FireAid spokesperson said organizations were notified of the grant by email Tuesday morning. However, multiple groups said they did not know of the award until notified by The Associated Press.",
      "The Eaton and Palisades Fires, which ignited on Jan. 7, killed at least 29 people and destroyed almost 17,000 structures, including homes, schools, places of worship and businesses. Rebuilding is estimated to take years. More than 135,000 people have registered for FEMA assistance, according to Los Angeles County.",

    "story": [
      "New government regulations on social media in Vietnam give authorities increased powers to prevent dissent and control the news, along with the tools to more easily track down critics and silence them",
      "BANGKOK -- New government regulations on social media in Vietnam give authorities increased powers to prevent dissent and control the news, along with the tools to more easily track down critics and silence them, according to an analysis released Tuesday.",
      "Vietnam's authorities implemented \u201cDecree 147\u201d in December, tightening regulations on social media companies like Facebook, X, YouTube and TikTok in a bid to further stifle criticism, said Ben Swanton, one of the authors of the report by The 88 Project, a group focused on human rights and free speech issues in Vietnam.",
      "\u201cAny challenge to the government and the Communist Party, any significant challenge to their official narrative of events, is perceived by them as a situation that is getting out of control,\u201d he said in an interview from Thailand.",
      "Among other things, the decree requires users to verify their accounts with phone numbers or national ID cards that must be provided to the government upon request, and for the social media companies to store their data in Vietnam.",
      "It also prevents social media users from engaging in citizen journalism or posting information about suspected government wrongdoing, and requires companies to remove posts deemed illegal within 24 hours. The decree requires companies to allow authorities access to their internal search engines so that it can identify offending content.",
      "Social media companies have until late March to be in compliance, and it is not yet clear whether they will try to push back. TikTok and Facebook refused to comment on their plans, while X and Google, which owns YouTube, did not return emails.",
      "Already, however, researchers have noticed a decline in political posts, Swanton said.",
      "\u201cIn the last several years Hanoi has imprisoned or forced into exile the country\u2019s most prominent independent journalists, reformers, human rights activists, and dissidents. This has had a chilling effect that encourages people to engage in self-censorship,\u201d he said. \u201cDecree 147 is designed to turn this chilling effect into an icy stranglehold on free speech.\u201d",
      "Vietnamese authorities did not respond to a request for comment on the Project 88 analysis or the intent behind the new decree.",
      "About 65 million Vietnamese have Facebook accounts, roughly two-thirds of the population, and some 35 million have YouTube accounts. About half of Vietnam's people say they get most of their news from social media.",
      "Already, the government frequently insists critical posts from outside the country be geo-blocked so they cannot be accessed inside Vietnam and it has moved quickly to censor posts it deems unacceptable, like a video of a top minister eating a gold-encrusted steak in London in 2021 while Vietnam was on COVID-19 lockdown.",
      "In October, a prominent Vietnamese blogger was sentenced to 12 years in prison for articles and videos exposing the corruption of government officials, and in January, a prominent Vietnamese lawyer was sentenced to three years in jail for Facebook posts criticizing the country's former top judge.",
      "Project 88 researchers said the new decree will also give authorities better tools to go after those who just read or watch social media posts as well.",
      "They noted a case last June in which police in one province went through the profiles of 13,328 members of a Facebook group that had information deemed \u201chostile to the state\u201d and identified 20 people in their province, went to their homes and demanded they leave the group.",
      "\u201cIf implemented as intended, Decree 147 would likely make it less time consuming to identify members of groups like this and ensure that groups with anti-state content will be blocked in the country,\u201d the report said.",
      "It urges social media companies and others affected to refuse to comply with provisions of the decree that violate free expression rights, and for the United States and United Nations to pressure Vietnam to repeal the measure."

      "The Trump administration is falsely claiming that tens of millions of dead people over 100 years old are receiving improper Social Security payments",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is falsely claiming that tens of millions of dead people over 100 years old are receiving Social Security payments.",
      "Over the past few days, President Donald Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk have said on social media and in press briefings that people who are 100, 200 and even 300 years old are improperly getting benefits \u2014 a \u201cHUGE problem,\u201d Musk wrote, as his Department of Government Efficiency digs into federal agencies to root out waste, fraud and abuse.",
      "It is true that improper payments have been made, including some to dead people. But the numbers thrown out by Musk and the White House are overstated and misrepresent Social Security data.",
      "Here are the facts:",
      "On Tuesday, Trump said at a press briefing in Florida that \u201cwe have millions and millions of people over 100 years old\u201d receiving Social Security benefits. \u201cThey\u2019re obviously fraudulent or incompetent,\u201d Trump said.",
      "\u201cIf you take all of those millions of people off Social Security, all of a sudden we have a very powerful Social Security with people that are 80 and 70 and 90, but not 200 years old,\u201d he said. He also said that there\u2019s one person in the system listed as 360 years old.",
      "Late Monday, Musk posted a slew of posts on his social media platform X, including: \u201cMaybe Twilight is real and there are a lot of vampires collecting Social Security,\u201d and \u201cHaving tens of millions of people marked in Social Security as \u201cALIVE\u201d when they are definitely dead is a HUGE problem. Obviously. Some of these people would have been alive before America existed as a country. Think about that for a second \u2026\u201d",
      "A July 2024 report from Social Security\u2019s inspector general states that from fiscal years 2015 through 2022, the agency paid out almost $8.6 trillion in benefits, including $71.8 billion \u2014 or less than 1% \u2014 in improper payments. Most of the erroneous payments were overpayments to living people.",
      "In addition, in early January, the U.S. Treasury clawed back more than $31 million in a variety of federal payments\u2014 not just Social Security payments\u2014 that improperly went to dead people, a recovery that former Treasury official David Lebryk said was \u201cjust the tip of the iceberg.\u201d",
      "The money was reclaimed as part of a five-month pilot program after Congress gave the Department of Treasury temporary access to the Social Security Administration\u2019s \u201cFull Death Master File\u201d for three years as part of the omnibus appropriations bill in 2021. The SSA maintains the most complete federal database of individuals who have died, and the file contains more than 142 million records, which go back to 1899, according to the Treasury.",
      "Treasury estimated in January that it would recover more than $215 million during its three-year access period, which runs from December 2023 through 2026.",
      "No.",
      "Part of the confusion comes from Social Security's software system called COBOL, which has a lack of date type in its programming. This means that some entries with missing or incomplete birthdates will default to a reference point of more than 150 years ago. The news organization WIRED first reported on the use of COBOL programming language at the Social Security Administration.",
      "Additionally, a series of reports from the Social Security Administration\u2019s inspector general in March 2023 and July 2024 state that the agency has not established a new system to properly annotate death information in its database, which included roughly 18.9 million Social Security numbers of people born in 1920 or earlier but were not marked as deceased. This does not mean, however, that these individuals were receiving benefits.",
      "The agency decided not to update the database because of the cost to do so, which would run upward of $9 million.",
      "A July 2023 Social Security OIG report states that \"almost none of the numberholders discussed in the report currently receive SSA payments.\u201d And, as of September 2015, the agency automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old.",
      "Chuck Blahous, a senior research strategist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, said, \u201cTwo cheers for Elon Musk if he can root out and put a stop to improper payments.\u201d",
      "But to pick the places in the federal government where error rates are high, \u201cSocial Security would be near the bottom of the list, not near the top,\u201d Blahous said. \"Medicaid improper payment rates are quite substantial, and soared after the Medicaid expansion of the ACA.\"",
      "\u201cBy all means \u2014 go after any improper payments that are found, but let\u2019s not pretend that\u2019s where the system\u2019s biggest financial problems are,\u201d he said.",
      "Sita Nataraj Slavov, a professor of public policy at the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University, said the claims by Musk and Trump will make people think the solutions to the government's financial problems are simpler than they appear.",
      "\u201cThe real concern is that this claim may mislead people into thinking there\u2019s an easy fix to Social Security\u2019s financial problems \u2014 that we can somehow restore solvency without making sacrifices through higher taxes or lower benefits,\u201d Slavov said. \u201cThis is simply not true.\u201d",
      "Karoline Leavitt, the White House spokesperson, referred back to the Social Security's inspector general report.",
      "\u201cA previous investigation revealed the SSA paid at least $71.8 billion in improper payments,\u201d she said. \"The Social Security Administration is now working to find even more waste, fraud, and abuse in the Administration\u2019s whole-of-government effort to protect American taxpayers.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump's billionaire top lieutenant, Elon Musk, is the focus for thousands of Democratic activists launching a massive protest campaign this week",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump is the president, but billionaire Elon Musk is the focus for thousands of Democratic activists launching a protest campaign this week to fight the Trump administration's push to gut federal health, education and human services agencies.",
      "Hundreds of protests are scheduled outside congressional offices and Tesla dealerships, with organizers hoping to send a pointed message to members of Congress who are on recess this week.",
      "The backlash still hasn't approached the intensity of protests during and after Trump's first inauguration eight years ago. But a loose coalition of Democrats and progressives is coalescing around Musk's rise as Trump's top lieutenant and his purge of the federal bureaucracy.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a major weak link in the MAGA coalition,\u201d Ezra Levin, co-founder of the progressive group Indivisible, said of Musk. \u201cI can\u2019t think of something that polls worse than the richest man in the world is coming after your Social Security check or your Meals on Wheels or your Head Start.\u201d",
      "Indivisible, which claims more than 1,300 local chapters nationwide, is encouraging members to protest at the offices of their members of Congress, regardless of political party. The group also offered a step-by-step guide for protesting at dealerships for Tesla, Musk's electric vehicle company.",
      "The memo encourages protesters to stay on sidewalks and public spaces and to avoid any actions that might directly interfere with business operations, such as blocking entrances or trespassing on private property. It also calls for Tesla protesters to stay on message: \u201cThis is about Musk\u2019s political takeover, not Tesla, SpaceX, or X as companies.\u201d",
      "Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is launching what he\u2019s calling \u201ca national tour to fight oligarchy\u201d with stops in working-class districts of Iowa and Nebraska this week.",
      "Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin will hit the road for the first time as party leader as well. The newly elected DNC chair will travel to Pennsylvania, Texas, Illinois, Wisconsin and Missouri in the coming days to meet with local Democratic officials and labor leaders, spokesperson Hannah Muldavin said.",
      "Like the protesters, Martin is expected to seize on Musk\u2019s role. During a meeting with labor leaders in Pittsburgh, for example, he plans to highlight Musk\u2019s recent focus on the Department of Labor, which could put \u201cthe integrity of data like the unemployment rate and inflation rate at risk, which is important for a stable U.S. economy and, by extension, working people,\u201d Muldavin said.",
      "Aware of the intense displeasure from their party\u2019s base, many House Democrats plan to be proactive.",
      "The House Democratic Policy and Communications Committee issued a memo ahead of the recess instructing Democrats to embrace \u201cnine days of visibility\u201d and said it was essential for members to host one town hall, in-person or via telephone, and at least one community event that highlights the \"devastating impacts\u201d of Trump and Musk\u2019s actions.",
      "The wave of protests comes at a critical moment as fractured Democrats struggle to stop the Republican president\u2019s purge of the federal bureaucracy, which features thousands of layoffs inside departments focused on public health, education, veterans affairs and human services, among others.",
      "Firings in recent days at the Department of Veterans Affairs include researchers working on cancer treatment, opioid addiction, prosthetics and burn pit exposure, according to U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington state. The cuts also include more than 5,000 employees at the Department of Health and Human Services and roughly one-tenth of the workforce at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "In some cases, Musk\u2019s team is trying \u2014 with Trump's blessing but without congressional approval \u2014 to shutter entire agencies, including the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Department of Education and the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "Trump has defended the cuts as necessary to eliminate waste and fraud. And he has praised Musk\u2019s work with his Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, saying it has found \u201cshocking\u201d evidence of wasteful spending. He signed an executive order expanding Musk\u2019s influence.",
      "Musk, meanwhile, has defended the swift and extensive cuts he\u2019s pushing across the federal government while acknowledging there have been mistakes.",
      "Democrats in Congress condemn the moves as dangerous, but without control of either chamber of Congress, there is little they can do to stop the Trump administration aside from turning to the courts. Still, three of the nation's largest progressive groups \u2014 Indivisible, MoveOn and the Working Families Party \u2014 are coordinating this week's protests to send a clear message to elected officials in both major political parties that they must do more.",
      "Still, Democratic members of Congress may face their own voters' fury.",
      "MoveOn, which boasts a membership of nearly 10 million, is hosting dozens of rallies outside town halls and congressional offices for those members who do not host public events. The group will focus on \u201cpersuadable House Republicans whose votes will be crucial to opposing the Trump-Musk agenda,\u201d according to a preview of its recess week plan. But there will also be rallies targeting House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, both of New York, among other Democrats.",

      "The Working Families Party is focusing protests in the districts of vulnerable Republicans in states such as California, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The actions will feature people directly impacted by the Trump administration's cuts, including special education teachers, nurses and Head Start workers, according to Working Families spokesman Ravi Mangla.",

      "Argentine lawyers filed fraud charges against President Javier Milei in criminal court on Sunday for promoting a cryptocurrency on his social media, one of the lawyers told The Associated Press",
      "MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay -- Argentine lawyers filed fraud charges against President Javier Milei in criminal court on Sunday for promoting a cryptocurrency on his social media, one of the lawyers told The Associated Press.",
      "On Friday, Milei posted on X about $LIBRA, a coin that he said was aimed at \u201cencouraging economic growth by funding small businesses and startups.\u201d",
      "He deleted the post a few hours later and the value of the currency collapsed, causing millions of dollars in losses to its brief investors, according to financial site Dexscreener.",
      "The coin, developed by KIP Protocol and Hayden Davis, could be obtained by accessing a link that directed users to a website called vivalalibertadproject.com, referring to the well-known phrase with which Milei closes speeches and messages on his social media.",
      "The President's Office said in a Saturday statement that Milei was not involved in any stage of the cryptocurrency\u2019s development and decided to remove the post to avoid speculation and limit further exposure, following the public reaction to the project\u2019s launch.",
      "Jonatan Baldiviezo, a lawyer and one of the plaintiffs, told the AP that they saw an illicit association to commit \u201can indeterminate number of frauds\u201d in the episode. \u201cWithin this illicit association, the crime of fraud was committed, in which the president\u2019s actions were essential,\u201d he said.",
      "Baldiviezo signed the petition with Marcos Zelaya, another lawyer; the engineer Mar\u00eda Eva Koutsovitis; and the economist Claudio Lozano, who presided over the Argentine Central Bank during former president Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s administration. Criminal justice is expected to assign a judge to the case or refer it to a prosecutor for further investigation on Monday.",
      "The plaintiffs saw in Milei\u2019s action an operation known in the crypto world as \u201crug pull.\u201d This occurs when a developer launches an attractive token to lure investors but later abandons it after funds become overpriced, making the tokens worthless. Baldiviezo also added that Milei violated the Public Ethics Law.",
      "\u201cThe President shared a post on his personal accounts announcing the launch of KIP Protocol\u2019s project, as he does daily with many entrepreneurs who wish to launch projects in Argentina to create jobs and attract investments,\u201d the President's Office said.",
      "After deleting the post, Milei said on X he was unaware of the currency's development and blamed his political opponents for trying to exploit the episode. \u201cI was not aware of the details of the project, and after getting informed, I decided not to continue promoting it (which is why I deleted the tweet),\u201d he said.",
      "The President's Office said the country's Anti-Corruption Office, which operates under the Executive Branch, would act immediately. The administration also acknowledged that Milei and members of his administration recently met with representatives of KIP Protocol at the presidential office.",
      "\u201cAll the information gathered in the investigation will be handed over to the judiciary to determine if any of the companies or individuals linked to the KIP Protocol project committed a crime,\u201d the Milei administration said in the Saturday statement.",

      "\u201cDespite prior commitments, Milei and his team unexpectedly changed their position, withdrawing their support and deleting all previous posts on social media,\u201d Davis said."

      "Some in the crypto industry hailed the launch of Trump\u2019s meme coin, which was quickly followed by the launch of First Lady Melania Trump\u2019s meme coin, as a sign of his enthusiasm and commitment to digital assets.",
      "Critics said it reflected poorly on the crypto industry\u2019s reputation at a time when it is hoping to become more mainstream.

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 10:10:22 -0500",
    "summary": "Residents in the German town of Geretsried have long wanted to run their buildings with clean heat and electricity from geothermal energy rather than fossil fuels",
    "story": [
      "Residents in the German town of Geretsried have long wanted to run their buildings with clean heat and electricity from geothermal energy rather than fossil fuels",
      "Residents in the German town of Geretsried have long wanted to run their buildings with clean heat and electricity from geothermal energy instead of fossil fuels.",
      "Their hopes were dashed about 15 years ago when a drilling company couldn't find enough hot water close to the surface to be profitable using traditional geothermal technology. That basically left them with natural gas.",
      "\u201cWe gave up. We had big hopes,\u201d recalled First Mayor of Geretsried Michael M\u00fcller, who was raised in the town.",
      "Today the next generation of geothermal companies is trying to succeed where previous efforts failed. They don't rely on hot water close to the surface, but instead use techniques developed in the oil and gas industry to drill deep and extract heat from dry, hot rock. One of them, Eavor, is starting up its first commercial power plant in Geretsried \u2014 turning the tiny town of about 26,000 people, south of Munich, into a proving ground for the future of geothermal energy.",
      "Can technology like this be scaled and really make a difference for the future of the planet? The International Energy Agency thinks so. In a recent report, it said technology breakthroughs are unlocking huge potential for geothermal energy. Now that companies are drilling deeper than 3 kilometers (close to 2 miles), nearly every country has the potential to make heat and electricity this way, the IEA said.",
      "\u201cIt has been a niche energy and concentrated in a few countries,\u201d IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in an interview. But soon, Birol said, \"geothermal can contribute to the global energy picture in an accelerated manner.\u201d",
      "Eavor CEO John Redfern said the earlier failure in Gerestried opened up the possibility for a high-profile success \u2014 Geretsried\u2019s ordinary geology was appealing. No one would\u2019ve been impressed if the Canadian company demonstrated its technology in Iceland, a place with abundant, easily accessible hot water, he added.",
      "It helped that the town was excited for geothermal and open to new ideas, he added.",
      "\u201cOur whole point is that we want to have geothermal anywhere, everywhere,\u201d Redfern said. \u201cWhat better way to prove that than to put our first well where they tried and failed with traditional geothermal systems.\u201d",
      "Germany is committed to transitioning away from fossil fuels. As part of the commitment, heating systems must switch to renewable sources because heating is one of the main sources of carbon dioxide emissions in Germany. And Germany couldn\u2019t depend on importing natural gas from Russia after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.",
      "Eavor, named for the phrase \u201cenergy for ever,\u201d has a demonstration facility in Alberta, Canada. Company executives know Geretsried well. One of them managed operations for the contractor that drilled there previously.",
      "This project will start by generating electricity in Geretsried, then add heat as the town fully builds out a district heating system.",
      "With district heating, heat is generated in a central location and distributed to homes and businesses. Most of these systems make their heat from burning fossil fuels, especially in China and Russia, which have the largest number of them, according to the IEA. Europe has 17,000 district heating and cooling networks, serving 67 million people, according to Euroheat & Power, the international network for district energy.",
      "In the United States, district energy systems are most often on college campuses, at hospitals, on military bases and in some downtown areas in larger cities. Some universities are switching their district heating systems off gas or heating oil to geothermal energy to address climate change. The Trump administration, while pivoting back to pro-oil and gas policies, does appear to also favor geothermal.",
      "Eavor has a contract to provide heat in the northwestern German city of Hanover, too. The city of more than 500,000 people is phasing out coal.",
      "Eavor is also licensing its technology to utilities and companies that are trying to curb emissions and want secure energy, Redfern said. A large Japanese power provider, Chubu Electric Power Company, is a major investor in Eavor. Japan has many sites suitable for geothermal but few geothermal power plants.",
      "The way it works is that Eavor drills two wells about 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) deep, then branches out and drills a dozen lateral wells, to maximize contact with the hot rock. The wells intersect to create a closed loop where water can flow, the \u201cEavor loop.\u201d The Geretsried project will have four loops, each with two vertical wells and about 12 lateral ones.",
      "Eavor does not frack, or hydraulically fracture, to create cracks and increase the permeability of rock.",
      "Instead in Geretsried, it will pump water down to flow through the hot rock, heating up on contact. It will rise naturally to the surface through an outlet well.",
      "That hot water can be used to heat the utility's water so it can be sent through pipes to heat the equivalent of about 36,000 homes. The hot water also can be routed to a power plant to make steam and then recirculated. When used to spin a turbine, that steam can generate electricity without any planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "M\u00fcller, the mayor, said it's better to start changing the approach to energy today than push it off to tomorrow. He said residents can't rely on fossil fuels long term, they have to address climate change and they need secure energy.",
      "\u201cWe want to remain future proof,\u201d he said. \u201cSo let's start the future.\u201d",

      "Germany needs a new business model to get its stalled economy going again",
      "MULFINGEN, Germany -- Germany needs a new business model. The old one, fueled by cheap natural gas from Russia and lucrative exports to China, is broken, leaving Europe's biggest economy mired in stagnation and angst about the future.",
      "Delivering that fresh growth strategy is going to be the biggest challenge for the government that takes office after a national election set for Feb. 23, seven months ahead of schedule. The nation that became known for the quality of its products has not seen real economic growth for five years.",
      "Multiple factors conspired to take Germany from industrial powerhouse to post-pandemic straggler: too much bureaucracy, a shortage of skilled workers, slow deployment of technology and a lack of clear direction from the outgoing coalition government are among them. Rising competition from China and high energy prices due to Russia's war in Ukraine were additional hits.",
      "\u201cWe really need a more company- and enterprise-friendly politics,\" said Klaus Geissdoerfer, CEO of industrial fan manufacturer EBM-Papst. \u201cWe have bright talent in Germany. We have good companies, but at the moment we don\u2019t have the awareness on the political level.\u201d",
      "With 2.5 billion euros ($2.6 billion) in annual revenue and plants on three continents, EBM-Papst describes itself as the global leader in its field. The company reported last year that it was \u201csuffering in Germany in particular\u201d and experienced a 4.1% revenue decline in its home market.",
      "Geissdoerfer said EBM-Papst\u2019s heating technology division lost 18.7% of its sales through a clumsily handled push to get property owners to replace gas furnaces with less polluting electric heat pumps.",
      "The requirements of the Building Energy Act put forward by Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019 three-party coalition were so confusing, people put off the upgrades to their heating systems or rushed to buy new gas devices before the law took effect, he said. That sapped demand for the ultra-quiet heat pump fans EBM-Papst makes.",
      "Consumers wondered, \u201cWhat is the right technology for my house?\u201d Geissdoerfer said. \u201cAnd so everybody said, 'If I don't have to, I better wait.'\u201d",
      "Geissdoerfer made a complaint heard across industry: Germany's bureaucracy is excessive. A 2023 law that requires public and private entities to combat climate change by reducing their energy use means EBM-Papst must assign employees to detail what the company is doing to comply, he said.",
      "\u201cSo now, instead of implementing measures, they write and report,\u201d the CEO said, adding that the documentation work is a poor use of time at a company whose core business is energy-saving equipment. \u201cI really hope with the new government we can get this solved, because at the moment it\u2019s too much.\u201d",
      "EBM-Papst is moving in the direction where economists say Germany as a whole should put its industrial resources: into green and digital technology. The company, headquartered in Mulfingen, a town of 3,700 residents in rural southwest Germany, is equipping energy-hungry artificial intelligence data centers with efficient cooling systems for their servers. It also is working on incorporating AI features to help tech companies optimize their power use and to predict when equipment needs to be replaced.",
      "In the meantime, EBM-Papst is coping with Germany\u2019s economic malaise by shifting its investment focus to Asia and the United States. The company now supplies U.S. customers, for instance, from plants in Farmington, Connecticut,and Telford, Tennessee. Its moves to localize production abroad predate the coronavirus pandemic but give EBM-Papst a shield against any new import taxes imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "On top of the homegrown issues, international relations have dealt another blow. Russia cut off most of the country's natural gas supplies over the German government's wartime support for Ukraine. Electricity prices, a key cost for industry, have risen to 2 1/2 times higher than in the U.S. and China.",
      "Metalworking firm Mecanindus-Vogelsang Group, which makes precision parts for automakers and other manufacturers, says it pays twice as much per kilowatt hour for the electricity its German plants use as it does for its U.S. sites in Mt. Sterling, Kentucky, and Lakewood, New Jersey. That's 100,000 euros in added costs and \u201ca gigantic competitive disadvantage\" CEO Ulrich Flatken said.",
      "\u201cTo avoid deindustrialization, which is already taking place, we urgently need internationally competitive energy prices,\u201d Flatken said.",
      "Another shock came from China, which throughout the 2010s served as a lucrative market for German-made machinery and automobiles. Once Chinese companies started making those same products, backed by government subsidies, German exports suffered.",
      "Germany's economy contracted in each of the last two years. By the end of 2024, it was only 0.3% bigger than it was in 2019, before the pandemic. The U.S. economy grew by 11.4% during over the same period, while China's expanded by 25.8%, according to Germany's Federal Statistical Office.",
      "Marcel Fratzscher, president of the German Institute for Economic Research, thinks complacency set in during the boom years of exports to China. German companies weren\u2019t quick enough to respond to technological trends, such as the move to electric cars, he said.",
      "\u201cThey enjoyed the success of the 2010s and they have been too slow in understanding that they need to change and adapt,\u201d Fratzscher said.",
      "As the economic woes drag on, \u201cmental depression\u201d has set in, he said. \u201cThe pessimism is enormous among companies and citizens, and that\u2019s an important explanation why companies are not investing.\u201d",
      "Many business executives and economists argue that Germany's next government should work to loosen constitutional limits on debt so it can increase public spending on infrastructure and education. Fratzscher wonders if political leaders, like the economy, will falter in adopting new ways of doing things.",
      "\u201cFor the past 75 years, Germany has been built very much on consensus, stability oriented, lots of checks and balances in the political system, and that makes rapid change very difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to change the mindset, to understand we need to be much faster on economic transformations.\u201d"

Milei distanced himself from the scandal and said he acted in good faith.",

      "The Trump administration has grown weary of sending additional U.S. aid to Ukraine and Hughes said a minerals deal would allow American taxpayers to \u201crecoup\u201d money sent to Kyiv, while growing Ukraine\u2019s economy.",
      "Hughes added that the White House believes \u201cbinding economic ties with the United States will be the best guarantee against future aggression and an integral part of lasting peace.\u201d He added: \u201cThe U.S. recognizes this, the Russians recognize this, and the Ukrainians must recognize this.\u201d",
      "U.S. officials in discussions with their Ukrainian counterparts in Munich were commercially minded and largely concentrated on the specifics of exploring the minerals and how to form a possible partnership to do that with Ukraine, the senior official said.",
      "The potential value of the deposits in Ukraine has not yet been discussed, with much unexplored or close to the front line.",
      "The U.S. proposal apparently did not take into account how the deposits would be secured in the event of continuing Russian aggression. The official suggested the U.S. did not have \u201cready answers,\u201d to that question and that one of their takeaways from discussions in Munich will be how to secure any mineral extraction operation in Ukraine involving people and infrastructure.",
      "Any deal must be in accordance with Ukrainian law and acceptable to the Ukrainian people, the senior Ukrainian official said.",
      "\u201cSubsoil belongs to Ukrainians under the constitution,\u201d Kseniiia Orynchak, founder of the National Association of Mining Industry of Ukraine, previously told the AP, suggesting a deal would need popular support.",
      "Zelenskyy and Vance did not discuss the details of the U.S. document during their meeting Friday at the Munich conference, the senior official said. That meeting was \u201cvery good\u201d and \u201csubstantive,\u201d with Vance making it clear his and Trump\u2019s main goal was to achieve a durable, lasting peace, the senior official said.",
      "Zelenskyy told Vance that real peace requires Ukraine to be in a \u201cstrong position\u201d when starting negotiations, stressed that the U.S negotiators should come to Ukraine, and that the U.S., Ukraine and Europe must be at the negotiating table for talks with Russia.",
      "But Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump\u2019s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, all but cut Europeans out of any Ukraine-Russia talks, despite Zelenskyy\u2019s request.",
      "\u201cYou can have the Ukrainians, the Russians, and clearly the Americans at the table talking,\u201d Kellogg said at an event hosted by a Ukrainian tycoon at the Munich conference. Pressed on whether that meant Europeans won\u2019t be included, he said: \u201cI\u2019m a school of realism. I think that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d",
      "Ukraine is now preparing a \u201ccounter proposal\u201d which will be delivered to the U.S. in \u201cthe near future,\u201d the official said.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s important that the vice president understood me that if we want to sign something, we have to understand that it will work,\u201d Zelenskyy told the AP.",
      "That means, he said, \u201cit will bring money and security.\u201d",

      "DOHA, Qatar -- Novak Djokovic says a majority of tennis players have lost faith in the anti-doping authorities following Jannik Sinner's three-month ban, and there's a widespread feeling that \u201cfavoritism\u201d is being shown to the sport's biggest stars.",
      "The 24-time major winner called on the World Anti-Doping Agency and the International Tennis Integrity Agency to overhaul their processes for dealing with doping cases \u201cbecause the system and the structure obviously doesn't work.\u201d",
      "\u201cRight now there is a lack of trust generally from the tennis players, both male and female, toward WADA and ITIA and the whole process,\u201d Djokovic said at the Qatar Open.",
      "Top-ranked Sinner reached a deal with WADA on Saturday to accept a ban that will have him back playing in time for the French Open in May without having to miss a single Grand Slam tournament. That came after the International Tennis Integrity Agency had decided not to suspend Sinner for what it judged was accidental contamination by a banned anabolic steroid last March.",
      "The short ban for Sinner came after five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek accepted a one-month suspension in November after testing positive for a banned substance that she said was accidentally consumed because of a contaminated nonprescription medication. Both bans are much shorter than what other athletes in tennis and in other sports have normally received in similar cases.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a good image for our sport, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Djokovic, the long-time No. 1 in men's tennis, said. \u201cThere\u2019s a majority of the players that I\u2019ve talked to in the locker room, not just in the last few days, but also last few months, that are not happy with the way this whole process (for Sinner) has been handled.",
      "\"A majority of the players don\u2019t feel that it\u2019s fair. A majority of the players feel like there is favoritism happening. It appears that you can almost affect the outcome if you are a top player, if you have access to the top lawyers and whatnot.\u201d",
      "Sinner had been scheduled to play in Qatar before accepting the ban.",
      "The handling of Sinner\u2019s case had already raised questions about double standards, and when the ban was announced it was widely criticized by other players. The positive tests weren\u2019t publicly revealed until August because Sinner successfully appealed against being provisionally banned from playing. He then won the U.S. Open in September and the Australian Open in January.",
      "Sinner\u2019s explanation for the positive test was that trace amounts of Clostebol in his doping sample was due to a massage from a trainer who used the substance after cutting his own finger, which WADA accepted.",
      "Djokovic said he didn't question Sinner's and Swiatek's innocence but that he and other players are frustrated about the inconsistent handling of doping cases.",
      "He pointed to the case of former women's No. 1 Simona Halep \u2014 who was given a four-year ban by the ITIA in 2022 after a positive test before it was later reduced to nine months \u2014 and British player Tara Moore, who was suspended in May 2022 while an investigation lasted 18 months before an independent tribunal determined that her positive test for a banned substance was caused by contaminated meat.",
      "\u201cRight now it\u2019s a ripe time for us to really address the system, because the system and the structure obviously doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s obvious,\" Djokovic said. \u201cSo, I hope that in the ... near future that the governing bodies are going to come together of our tours and the tennis ecosystem and try to find a more effective way to to deal with these processes.\"",

      "\u201cOver several years, the French authorities have enacted laws and policies to regulate Muslim women\u2019s and girls\u2019 clothing, in discriminatory ways. Sport federations have followed suit, imposing hijab bans in several sports.\u201d",
      "Two years ago, France\u2019s highest administrative court said the country\u2019s soccer federation was entitled to ban headscarves in competitions even though the measure can limit freedom of expression.",
      "Wielding the principle of religious neutrality enshrined in the constitution, the country\u2019s soccer federation also does not make things easy for international players who want to refrain from drinking or eating from dawn to sunset during the Ramadan, Islamic holy month.",
      "Supporters of the bill cite growing attacks on secularism in sport, arguing that its core values are based on a principle of universality. To protect sports grounds from any non-sporting confrontation, they say, a principle of neutrality needs to be implemented to ensure that no political, religious or racial demonstration or propaganda can be promoted.",
      "The bill also states that using part of a sports facility as a place of worship would be a misuse of its purpose, and bans the wearing of religious clothing, such as the burkini, in public swimming pools.",
      "\u201cBy placing the wearing of a headscarf on the spectrum of \u201cattacks on secularism\u201d, which range from \u201cpermissiveness\u201d to \u201cterrorism\u201d, this legislation, if passed, would fuel racism and reinforce the growing hostile environment facing Muslims and those perceived to be Muslim in France,\u201d Amnesty International said.",

      "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- Slick-fielding shortstop Geraldo Perdomo has agreed to a $45 million, four-year contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks that begins in 2026.",
      "The deal announced Tuesday includes a club option for 2030. Perdomo, who could have become eligible for free agency following the 2027 season, will make $2.55 million this year after being eligible for salary arbitration for the first time.",
      "The 25-year-old was an All-Star in 2023, the same year he helped the Diamondbacks reach the World Series. He missed a big chunk of last season with a torn meniscus in his right knee and hit .273 with three homers over 98 games, providing above-average defense at a crucial position.",
      "Now, he'll be a key piece moving forward as the franchise tries to win a Fall Classic for the first time since 2001.",
      "\u201cWe're ready to go,\u201d Perdomo said. \u201cWe didn't finish our job the last two years. It's win the World Series. That's the mindset for us and for everybody here.\u201d",
      "Perdomo usually hits lower in the batting order, but has a good eye at the plate with a .344 on-base percentage last season. Now entering his fifth season, the shortstop is well-liked in the clubhouse and emerging as a leader after the departure of first baseman Christian Walker, who signed with the Houston Astros.",
      "\u201cThe way he plays the baseball game is the way we try to play the baseball game,\u201d D-backs GM Mike Hazen said. \u201cIt's smart, fast and dynamic on both sides of the ball.\"",
      "The Diamondbacks have been aggressive this offseason as they try to compete with the big-spending Los Angeles Dodgers, San Diego Padres and San Francisco Giants in the NL West. Arizona's biggest move was signing ace pitcher Corbin Burnes to a $210 million, six-year deal in December.",

      "The race\u2019s description of the trail for mushers encourages them to do this stretch in a convoy with one or more teams because they might require help. Conditions include windblown gravel sandbars, high winds, rivers, a glacier, slippery conditions and ice at the bottom of a canyon.",

      "LYON, France -- Just five years before the opening ceremony, French organizers of the 2030 Winter Games put on a united front Tuesday to unveil the team given the tightest schedule of any modern Olympics.",
      "The 2030 French Alps Olympics must tie together snow and sliding venues in the mountains with skating and curling arenas among the palm trees on the Riviera coastal city Nice.",
      "A bid hastily pulled together in 2023 was approved by the International Olympic Committee only last July \u2014 in Paris on the eve of a hugely successful Summer Games \u2014 and even then with a special exemption to wait several months for guarantees from the national government.",
      "The project is now led by Edgar Grospiron, a freestyle skiing gold medalist in 1992 when France last hosted the Winter Games and a late hire in recent days as president of the organizing committee.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s important now is that from now we organize it, we deliver it,\u201d Grospiron said at a slick launch event at the stadium of soccer club Lyon, aiming for a Winter Games that is \"impeccable and irreproachable.\u201d",
      "Grospiron spoke after a parade of national and regional political figures, including sports minister Marie Barsacq and Michel Barnier, who as prime minister last October signed off the government\u2019s support.",
      "Layers of lawmakers\u2019 support has been vital to a project that still needs an ice arena built in Nice and a venue for speed skating, which could end up in Italy or the Netherlands.",
      "The popular success and expertise gained at the Paris Olympics was stressed as a foundation for the Winter Games which used to be given seven years by the IOC to organize.",
      "\u201cWe are not starting from zero,\u201d the IOC\u2019s executive director of Olympic Games, Christophe Dubi, told The Associated Press. \u201cWe had a great shortcut and it\u2019s called Paris 2024. Many of those things we can cut and paste.\u201d",
      "The IOC started 2023 with no clear candidate and a shrinking pool of options to host a cost-effective and sustainable Winter Games in 2030. A Swedish project centered on Stockholm seemed favored before a French bid emerged out of the IOC\u2019s strong pre-Paris relations with President Emmanuel Macron and national Olympic officials.",

      "\u201cWe are the cradle of Olympism,\u201d said David Lappartient, leader of the French Olympic body and a candidate in the IOC presidential election next month. France already hosted three Summer Games in Paris and three previous Winter Games: Chamonix in 1924, Grenoble in 1968 and Albertville in 1992 that Barnier helped organize.",
      "The French Alps organizing committee has a prudent operational budget of 2 billion euros ($2.1 billion) and speakers Tuesday stressed the need for a project that was financially sober and in moderation.",
      "A key theme also was adapting to climate change and delivering an Olympics and subsequent Paralympic Winter Games that are sustainable.",

      "MADRID -- The World Anti-Doping Agency on Monday offered an explanation for why top-ranked tennis player Jannik Sinner received a much shorter doping ban than the six-year suspension it handed to a Spanish figure skater in a similar doping case.",
      "Spanish media has been calling attention to the lengthy ban handed to local skater Laura Barquero after she tested positive for the anabolic Clostebol, the same substance that earned Sinner a three-month ban after a settlement reached between WADA and the Italian tennis player on Saturday. The deal was criticized by many of his fellow tennis professionals this weekend.",
      "WADA pointed out that while both cases involved the same substance, the specific facts related to Barquero's case were \u201cvery different\u201d to Sinner's.",
      "\u201cThe fundamental difference between the two cases is that Ms. Barquero\u2019s version of how the substance entered her system was unconvincing in light of the evidence, such that the circumstances remained unknown as far as WADA was concerned,\" WADA said in an email sent to The Associated Press. \"In contrast, in the Sinner case, the evidence clearly confirmed the athlete\u2019s explanation as outlined in the first instance decision.\u201d",
      "Barquero first tested positive for Clostebol during the 2022 Winter Olympics, then again in January 2023 in an out-of-competition test carried out by the International Skating Union. WADA eventually entered into a \u201ccase resolution agreement\u201d in which the athlete was suspended for six years. It said the agreement was accepted and signed by WADA, the ISU and the athlete herself.",
      "\u201cIf Ms. Barquero did not agree with the proposed sanction, she was not obliged to sign the case resolution agreement and was free to take the case forward for hearing at CAS,\u201d WADA said.",
      "The agency had sought to ban Sinner, a three-time Grand Slam champion, for at least one year. It had challenged a decision last year by the International Tennis Integrity Agency not to suspend Sinner for what the ITIA judged was accidental contamination of the banned anabolic steroid last March.",
      "WADA formally withdrew its appeal saying it accepted the athlete\u2019s explanation for the cause of the violation, and that Sinner did not intend to cheat.",
      "Sinner\u2019s explanation was that trace amounts of Clostebol in his doping sample was due to a massage from a trainer who used the substance after cutting his own finger.",
      "Barquero\u2019s Instagram account republished several stories calling attention to the discrepancy in the punishment given to her and to Sinner. She then posted a video talking about how her lengthy suspension had affected her.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a disproportionate sanction that meant the end of my career,\" she said. \"I believe it serves as a clear example of the failures of the system. I really don\u2019t know what happened. But I have to assume the consequences, accept the current regulations and face sanctions that sometimes are extremely disproportionate.\u201d",
      "The 23-year-old Barquero said she decided to accept the six-year ban based on \u201cunfair rules\u201d and so she could start moving on with her life.",
      "She said the trace amounts of Clostebol showed up in her results through the contamination of a cream commonly used to treat skin wounds that is sold in Italy without prescription and not intended to improve sporting performance.",
      "\u201cI had the misfortune of accidentally contaminating myself with a cream that a colleague had bought and that was used by people close to me,\u201d she said. \"I couldn\u2019t imagine that to test positive all you have to do is touch a person who has used that cream, or touch an object that was in contact with the cream.\u201d",

      "Victor Wembanyama and Chris Paul made history on All-Star Saturday night",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Victor Wembanyama and Chris Paul made history on All-Star Saturday night.",
      "The wrong type of history, that is.",
      "The San Antonio teammates were disqualified from the Skills Challenge on All-Star Saturday night because their shot attempts during the event were not \u201cvalid,\" as the rules required. And afterward, all everyone wanted to know was who came up with the plan.",
      "\u201cI did,\u201d Wembanyama said. \u201cI don't regret it. I think it was a good idea.\u201d",
      "The challenge included bounce passes, chest passes, shots from three different locations on the floor and dribbling. On the shots \u2014 from the corner over an automated defender, near the top of the arc and at the elbow \u2014 players had to either make one or shoot three, whichever came first.",
      "Wembanyama read the rules and determined that if he and Paul simply flipped the three shots from each location forward they would save a lot of time.",
      "And they did. Their time in the first round was 47.9 seconds, easily the best. It just didn't count after the NBA evidently thought their effort wasn't in the spirit of taking \u201cvalid\u201d shots, like the rules state.",
      "\u201cWe had the best time,\u201d Wembanyama said. \"Numbers speak for themselves.\"",
      "It was a most unconventional approach, but Wembanyama didn't surprise other competitors with his plan. Golden State's Draymond Green, who paired up with Warriors teammate Moses Moody in the event, said Wembanyama asked people beforehand if his plan was acceptable.",
      "\u201cIt definitely sucked to see them throwing the ball like that,\u201d Green said. \u201cBut what I will say is Wemby walked around the court asking everybody, \u2018Make one or three attempts?\u2019 And Wemby said, \u2018Oh, so I can get all three of them up there?\u2019 So, he asked. Now, he may not have asked the right people. But I will say, in Wemby's defense, he did ask a lot of people.\u201d",
      "Green and Moody lost to the Cleveland duo of Donovan Mitchell and Evan Mobley in the final of the skills event. Mitchell reacted by waving two-thumbs-down when Paul and Wembanyama finished, as some in the crowd booed.",
      "\u201cIf they weren\u2019t disqualified, I think we probably would have just did the same thing, to be honest with you,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cPlay to win, I guess.\u201d",
      "Mobley indicated that he had similar thinking as Wembanyama.",
      "\u201cI feel like my first round I tried to do a similar thing but made it look like a real shot,\u201d Mobley said. \u201cBut that didn\u2019t work really well, so I switched up my strategy.\u201d",
      "Paul also said Wembanyama asked about the strategy beforehand. He said he had a good time nonetheless.",
      "\u201cWe tried something that we thought could win,\u201d Paul said. \u201cTo see if we had the best time, so ... it was fun.\"",
      "Green said Paul warmed up taking conventional shots, presumably before Wembanyama \u2014 a second-year player and the league's reigning rookie of the year, who'll play in his first All-Star Game on Sunday \u2014 presented his time-saving plan.",
      "\u201cThe old man followed the rookie,\u201d Green said, \u201cright off the cliff.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Patrick Rodgers has a chance for his first PGA Tour victory after a wild day at the Genesis Invitational",
      "SAN DIEGO -- Patrick Rodgers is often mentioned alongside Tiger Woods because they share the Stanford record for most wins. What usually follows is the reminder that the 32-year-old Rodgers has yet to win on the PGA Tour.",
      "He has a chance to change that in the Genesis Invitational, with Woods presenting the trophy.",
      "Rodgers was at his best Saturday when golf's best were faltering on a tough day at Torrey Pines, playing mistake-free until dumping a gap wedge into the water on the par-5 18th for his only bogey. That gave him a 4-under 68 and a one-shot lead going into the final round.",
      "\u201cWhenever my name is mentioned, that\u2019s the first thing that everybody says professionally so it\u2019s something that I have to deal with,\u201d said Rodgers, who has played 283 times on the PGA Tour as a pro without winning.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve struggled with it for a long time, but I feel like I\u2019m viewing my career from a different vantage point now and I\u2019m excited about the opportunity to cross that finish line tomorrow.\u201d",
      "Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy have a longer road than they imagined to that line. Both were in contention early, and both faded in their own way with a series of mistakes, each with a three-putt from the 12-foot range. They were five behind.",
      "Rodgers was at 8-under 208, one shot ahead of Denny McCarty (71). Ludvig Aberg, who had an ace on the par-3 third hole, had a 70 and was another shot behind.",
      "Rodgers won 11 times at Stanford, same as Woods (and later Maverick McNealy). Now he is one round away from Woods, the tournament host who is likely to be at Torrey Pines on Sunday, presenting him the trophy. Woods withdrew when his mother died last week.",
      "But for Rodgers, 18 holes can feel like a marathon, especially on a beast like the South course at Torrey Pines.",
      "The course did a number on Scheffler and McIlroy.",
      "Scheffler, the world's No. 1 player, tied Davis Thompson for the lead with a birdie on the fifth and had the easily reachable par-5 sixth ahead of him. But he hit 7-wood from a fairway bunker into the crowd and then three-putted from just inside 15 feet for bogey.",
      "He also took two chips from thick rough near the par-5 ninth green and made bogey, took double bogey with a tee shot into the hazard on the 14th and wound up with a 76, his highest score in nearly three years.",
      "He was five shots behind with McIlroy, whose round of 74 was more of a slow bleed until he three-putted from 12 feet on the par-3 16th.",
      "Scheffler and McIlroy will be paired together in the final round, teeing off a lot earlier than both of them would have liked.",
      "The first day of full sunshine allowed for some good scoring early before a strong Pacific breeze kicked in. Tony Finau chipped in three times on his way to a 67. He started the day nine shots behind and will be in the penultimate group Sunday, four shots back.",
      "Also four back were Patrick Cantlay (68), Tommy Fleetwood (69) and Thompson, the 36-hole leader who was holding his own until a 40 on the back nine gave him a 76.",
      "McCarthy, steady through a roller coast day for so many others, also is going for his first PGA Tour win. But far more was expected from Rodgers, who grew up in amateur golf with Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas and has watched them pile up tour wins and majors.",
      "He has switched his thinking from playing with expectations to simply trying to perform.",
      "\u201cIt felt like early in my career with the amateur resume that I had, I felt like there was a lot expected of myself internally,\" he said. \"And it was something where when immediate success, immediate wins didn\u2019t come straight away, it was kind of fighting who I saw myself to be.",
      "\u201cSo instead of playing with a monkey on your back that gets bigger and bigger over time when it doesn\u2019t happen, I\u2019m trying to play from a perspective that feels fresh and new and exciting and full of opportunity. Because that\u2019s what this game is, and I have a great one tomorrow.\u201d",
      "The bogey on the 18th \u2014 his gap wedge came out softer than he imagined from the first cut and barely reached the green before rolling down the hill \u2014 was his only blemish. Still, he had a 54-hole lead for only the third time in his 11 years on tour.",
      "His best work came on the back nine, starting with a 4-iron he laced into 15 feet for birdie on the 504-yard 12th hole, and a 3-wood onto the green at the par-5 13th. Only three other players hit that green in two.",
      "Rodgers also holed a 40-foot birdie putt across the 17th before his bogey at the end.",
      "Aberg played alongside Rodgers and was impressed with what he saw.",
      "\u201cHe played amazing and he was great off the tee,\u201d Aberg said. \u201cYou can be rewarded and have a lot of good chances into the greens, but as soon as you start missing the fairways, it gets pretty difficult. It\u2019s a great golf course, it\u2019s a U.S. Open golf course, and it definitely played that way today.\u201d",

      "Chinese tech giant Huawei has held a global launch for the industry\u2019s first tri-foldable phone",
      "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Huawei on Tuesday held a global launch for the industry\u2019s first tri-foldable phone, which analysts said marked a symbolic victory for the Chinese tech giant amid U.S. technology curbs. But challenges over pricing, longevity, supply and app constraints may limit its success.",
      "Huawei said at a launch event in Kuala Lumpur that the Huawei Mate XT, first unveiled in China five months ago, will be priced at 3,499 euros ($3,662). Although dubbed a trifold, the phone has three mini-panels and folds only twice. The company says it's the thinnest foldable phone at 3.6 millimeters (0.14 inches), with a 10.2-inch screen similar to an Apple iPad.",
      "\u201cRight now, Huawei kind of stands alone as an innovator\" with the trifold design, said Bryan Ma, vice president of device research with the market intelligence firm International Data Corporation.",
      "Huawei reached the position despite \u201cnot getting access to chips, to Google services. All these things basically have been huge roadblocks in front of Huawei,\u201d Ma said, adding that the \u201cresurgence we're seeing from them over the past year has been quite a bit of a victory.\"",
      "Huawei, China\u2019s first global tech brand, is at the center of a U.S.-China battle over trade and technology. Washington in 2019 severed Huawei\u2019s access to U.S. components and technology, including Google\u2019s music and other smartphone services, making Huawei's phone less appealing to users. It has also barred global vendors from using U.S. technology to produce components for Huawei.",
      "American officials say Huawei is a security risk, which the company denies. China\u2019s government has accused Washington of misusing security warnings to contain a rising competitor to U.S. technology companies.",
      "Huawei launched the Mate XT in China on Sept. 20 last year, the same day Apple launched its iPhone 16 series in global markets. But with its steep price tag, the Mate XT \u201cis not a mainstream product that people are going to jump for,\u201d Ma said.",
      "At the Kuala Lumpur event, Huawei also unveiled its MatePad Pro tablet and Free Arc, its first open-ear earbuds with ear hooks and other wearable devices.",
      "While Huawei\u2019s cutting-edge devices showcase its technological prowess, its long-term success remains uncertain given ongoing challenges over global supply chain constraints, chip availability and limitations on the software ecosystem, said Ruby Lu, an analyst with the research firm TrendForce.",
      "\"System limitations, particularly the lack of Google Mobile Services, means its international market potential remains constrained,\u201d Lu said.",
      "IDC's Ma said Huawei dominated the foldable phone market in China with 49% market share last year. In the global market, it had 23% market share, trailing behind Samsung's 33% share in 2024, he said. IDC predicted that total foldable phone shipments worldwide could surge to 45.7 million units by 2028, from over 20 million last year.",
      "While most major brands have entered the foldable segments, Lu said Apple has yet to release a competing product.",
      "\u201cOnce Apple enters the market, it is expected to significantly influence and stimulate further growth in the foldable phone sector,\u201d Lu added."

      "Why did humans start speaking",
      "Why did humans start speaking? Scientists suggest genetics played a big role \u2013 and they say the evolution of this singular ability was key to our survival.",
      "A new study links a particular gene to the ancient origins of spoken language, proposing that a protein variant found only in humans may have helped us communicate in a novel way. Speech allowed us to share information, coordinate activities and pass down knowledge, giving us an edge over extinct cousins like Neanderthals and Denisovans.",
      "The new study is \u201ca good first step to start looking at the specific genes\u201d that may affect speech and language development, said Liza Finestack at the University of Minnesota, who was not involved with the research.",
      "What scientists learn may someday even help people with speech problems.",
      "The genetic variant researchers were looking at was one of a variety of genes \"that contributed to the emergence of Homo sapiens as the dominant species, which we are today\u201d said Dr. Robert Darnell, an author of the study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "Darnell has been studying the protein \u2013 called NOVA1 and known to be crucial to brain development \u2013 since the early 1990s. For the latest research, scientists in his lab at New York's Rockefeller University used CRISPR gene editing to replace the NOVA1 protein found in mice with the exclusively human type to test the real-life effects of the genetic variant. To their surprise, it changed the way the animals vocalized when they called out to each other.",
      "Baby mice with the human variant squeaked differently than normal littermates when their mom came around. Adult male mice with the variant chirped differently than their normal counterparts when they saw a female in heat.",
      "Both are settings where mice are motivated to speak, Darnell said, \u201cand they spoke differently\" with the human variant, illustrating its role in speech.",
      "This isn't the first time a gene has been linked to speech. In 2001, British scientists said they had discovered the first gene tied to a language and speech disorder.",
      "Called FOXP2, it was referred to as the human language gene. But though FOXP2 is involved in human language, it turned out that the variant in modern humans wasn't unique to us. Later research found it was shared with Neanderthals. The NOVA1 variant in modern humans, on the other hand, is found exclusively in our species, Darnell said.",
      "The presence of a gene variant isn't the only reason people can speak. The ability also depends on things like anatomical features in the human throat and areas of the brain that work together to allow people to speak and understand language.",
      "Darnell hopes the recent work not only helps people better understand their origins but also eventually leads to new ways to treat speech-related problems.",
      "University of Minnesota's Finestack said it\u2019s more likely the genetic findings might someday allow scientists to detect, very early in life, who might need speech and language interventions.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s certainly a possibility,\u201d she said.",

      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- U.S. tech giants have quietly empowered Israel to track and kill many more alleged militants more quickly in Gaza and Lebanon through a sharp spike in artificial intelligence and computing services. But the number of civilians killed has also soared, fueling fears that these tools are contributing to the deaths of innocent people.",
      "Militaries have for years hired private companies to build custom autonomous weapons. However, Israel's recent wars mark a leading instance in which commercial AI models made in the United States have been used in active warfare, despite concerns that they were not originally developed to help decide who lives and who dies.",
      "The Israeli military uses AI to sift through vast troves of intelligence, intercepted communications and surveillance to find suspicious speech or behavior and learn the movements of its enemies. After a deadly surprise attack by Hamas militants on Oct. 7, 2023, its use of Microsoft and OpenAI technology skyrocketed, an Associated Press investigation found. The investigation also revealed new details of how AI systems select targets and ways they can go wrong, including faulty data or flawed algorithms. It was based on internal documents, data and exclusive interviews with current and former Israeli officials and company employees.",
      "\u201cThis is the first confirmation we have gotten that commercial AI models are directly being used in warfare,\u201d said Heidy Khlaaf, chief AI scientist at the AI Now Institute and former senior safety engineer at OpenAI. \u201cThe implications are enormous for the role of tech in enabling this type of unethical and unlawful warfare going forward.\u201d",
      "As U.S. tech titans ascend to prominent roles under President Donald Trump, the AP\u2019s findings raise questions about Silicon Valley\u2019s role in the future of automated warfare. Microsoft expects its partnership with the Israeli military to grow, and what happens with Israel may help determine the use of these emerging technologies around the world.",
      "The Israeli military\u2019s usage of Microsoft and OpenAI artificial intelligence spiked last March to nearly 200 times higher than before the week leading up to the Oct. 7 attack, the AP found in reviewing internal company information. The amount of data it stored on Microsoft servers doubled between that time and July 2024 to more than 13.6 petabytes \u2014 roughly 350 times the digital memory needed to store every book in the Library of Congress. Usage of Microsoft\u2019s huge banks of computer servers by the military also rose by almost two-thirds in the first two months of the war alone.",
      "Israel\u2019s goal after the attack that killed about 1,200 people and took over 250 hostages was to eradicate Hamas, and its military has called AI a \u201cgame changer\u201d in yielding targets more swiftly. Since the war started, more than 50,000 people have died in Gaza and Lebanon and nearly 70% of the buildings in Gaza have been devastated, according to health ministries in Gaza and Lebanon.",
      "The AP\u2019s investigation drew on interviews with six current and former members of the Israeli army, including three reserve intelligence officers. Most spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss sensitive military operations.",
      "The AP also interviewed 14 current and former employees inside Microsoft, OpenAI, Google and Amazon, most of whom also spoke anonymously for fear of retribution. Journalists reviewed internal company data and documents, including one detailing the terms of a $133 million contract between Microsoft and Israel\u2019s Ministry of Defense.",
      "The Israeli military says its analysts use AI-enabled systems to help identify targets but independently examine them together with high-ranking officers to meet international law, weighing the military advantage against the collateral damage. A senior Israeli intelligence official authorized to speak to the AP said lawful military targets may include combatants fighting against Israel, wherever they are, and buildings used by militants. Officials insist that even when AI plays a role, there are always several layers of humans in the loop.",
      "\u201cThese AI tools make the intelligence process more accurate and more effective,\u201d said an Israeli military statement to the AP. \u201c\u2060They make more targets faster, but not at the expense of accuracy, and many times in this war they\u2019ve been able to minimize civilian casualties.\u201d",
      "The Israeli military declined to answer detailed written questions from the AP about its use of commercial AI products from American tech companies.",
      "Microsoft declined to comment for this story and did not respond to a detailed list of written questions about cloud and AI services provided to the Israeli military. In a statement on its website, the company says it is committed \u201cto champion the positive role of technology across the globe.\u201d In its 40-page Responsible AI Transparency Report for 2024, Microsoft pledges to manage the risks of AI throughout development \u201cto reduce the risk of harm,\u201d and does not mention its lucrative military contracts.",
      "Advanced AI models are provided through OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, through Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud platform, where they are purchased by the Israeli military, the documents and data show. Microsoft has been OpenAI's largest investor. OpenAI said it does not have a partnership with Israel's military, and its usage policies say its customers should not use its products to develop weapons, destroy property or harm people. About a year ago, however, OpenAI changed its terms of use from barring military use to allowing for \u201cnational security use cases that align with our mission.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s extremely hard to identify when AI systems enable errors because they are used with so many other forms of intelligence, including human intelligence, sources said. But together they can lead to wrongful deaths.",
      "In November 2023, Hoda Hijazi was fleeing with her three young daughters and her mother from clashes between Israel and Hamas ally Hezbollah on the Lebanese border when their car was bombed.",
      "Before they left, the adults told the girls to play in front of the house so that Israeli drones would know they were traveling with children. The women and girls drove alongside Hijazi\u2019s uncle, Samir Ayoub, a journalist with a leftist radio station, who was caravanning in his own car. They heard the frenetic buzz of a drone very low overhead.",
      "Soon, an airstrike hit the car Hijazi was driving. It careened down a slope and burst into flames. Ayoub managed to pull Hijazi out, but her mother \u2014 Ayoub\u2019s sister \u2014 and the three girls \u2014 Rimas, 14, Taline, 12, and Liane, 10 \u2014 were dead.",
      "Before they left their home, Hijazi recalled, one of the girls had insisted on taking pictures of the cats in the garden \u201cbecause maybe we won\u2019t see them again.\u201d",
      "In the end, she said, \u201cthe cats survived and the girls are gone.\u201d",
      "Video footage from a security camera at a convenience store shortly before the strike showed the Hijazi family in a Hyundai SUV, with the mother and one of the girls loading jugs of water. The family says the video proves Israeli drones should have seen the women and children.",
      "The day after the family was hit, the Israeli military released video of the strike along with a package of similar videos and photos. A statement released with the images said Israeli fighter jets had \u201cstruck just over 450 Hamas targets.\" The AP\u2019s visual analysis matched the road and other geographical features in the Israeli military video to satellite imagery of the location where the three girls died, 1 mile (1.7 kilometers) from the store.",
      "An Israeli intelligence officer told the AP that AI has been used to help pinpoint all targets in the past three years. In this case, AI likely pinpointed a residence, and other intelligence gathering could have placed a person there. At some point, the car left the residence.",
      "Humans in the target room would have decided to strike. The error could have happened at any point, he said: Previous faulty information could have flagged the wrong residence, or they could have hit the wrong vehicle.",
      "The AP also saw a message from a second source with knowledge of that airstrike who confirmed it was a mistake, but didn\u2019t elaborate.",
      "A spokesperson for the Israeli military denied that AI systems were used during the airstrike itself, but refused to answer whether AI helped select the target or whether it was wrong. The military told the AP that officials examined the incident and expressed \u201csorrow for the outcome.\u201d",
      "Microsoft and the San Francisco-based startup OpenAI are among a legion of U.S. tech firms that have supported Israel\u2019s wars in recent years.",
      "Google and Amazon provide cloud computing and AI services to the Israeli military under \u201cProject Nimbus,\u201d a $1.2 billion contract signed in 2021 when Israel first tested out its in-house AI-powered targeting systems. The military has used Cisco and Dell server farms or data centers. Red Hat, an independent IBM subsidiary, also has provided cloud computing technologies to the Israeli military, and Palantir Technologies, a Microsoft partner in U.S. defense contracts, has a \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d providing AI systems to help Israel\u2019s war efforts.",
      "Google said it is committed to responsibly developing and deploying AI \u201cthat protects people, promotes global growth, and supports national security.\u201d Dell provided a statement saying the company commits to the highest standards in working with public and private organizations globally, including in Israel. Red Hat spokesperson Allison Showalter said the company is proud of its global customers, who comply with Red Hat's terms to adhere to applicable laws and regulations.",
      "Palantir, Cisco and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment. Amazon declined to comment.",
      "The Israeli military uses Microsoft Azure to compile information gathered through mass surveillance, which it transcribes and translates, including phone calls, texts and audio messages, according to an Israeli intelligence officer who works with the systems. That data can then be cross-checked with Israel\u2019s in-house targeting systems and vice versa.",
      "He said he relies on Azure to quickly search for terms and patterns within massive text troves, such as finding conversations between two people within a 50-page document. Azure also can find people giving directions to one another in the text, which can then be cross-referenced with the military\u2019s own AI systems to pinpoint locations.",
      "The Microsoft data AP reviewed shows that since the Oct. 7 attack, the Israeli military has made heavy use of transcription and translation tools and OpenAI models, although it does not detail which. Typically, AI models that transcribe and translate perform best in English. OpenAI has acknowledged that its popular AI-powered translation model Whisper, which can transcribe and translate into multiple languages including Arabic, can make up text that no one said, including adding racial commentary and violent rhetoric.",
      "\u201cShould we be basing these decisions on things that the model could be making up?\u201d said Joshua Kroll, an assistant professor of computer science at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, who spoke to the AP in his personal capacity, not reflecting the views of the U.S. government.",
      "The Israeli military said any phone conversation translated from Arabic or intelligence used in identifying a target has to be reviewed by an Arabic-speaking officer.",
      "Errors can still happen for many reasons involving AI, said Israeli military officers who have worked with the targeting systems and other tech experts. One intelligence officer said he had seen targeting mistakes that relied on incorrect machine translations from Arabic to Hebrew.",
      "The Arabic word describing the grip on the launch tube for a rocket-propelled grenade is the same as the word for \u201cpayment.\u201d In one instance the machine translated it wrong, and the person verifying the translation initially didn\u2019t catch the error, he said, which could have added people speaking about payments to target lists. The officer was there by chance and caught the problem, he said.",
      "Intercepted phone calls tied to a person\u2019s profile also include the time the person called and the names and numbers of those on the call. But it takes an extra step to listen to and verify the original audio, or to see a translated transcript.",
      "Sometimes the data attached to people\u2019s profiles is wrong. For example, the system misidentified a list of high school students as potential militants, according to the officer. An Excel spreadsheet attached to several people\u2019s profiles titled \u201cfinals\u201d in Arabic, contained at least 1,000 students\u2019 names on an exam list in one area of Gaza, he said. This was the only piece of incriminating evidence attached to people\u2019s files, he said, and had he not caught the mistake, those Palestinians could have been wrongly flagged.",
      "He said he also worried that young officers, some still younger than 20, under pressure to find targets quickly with the help of AI would jump to conclusions.",
      "AI alone could lead to the wrong conclusion, said another soldier who worked with the targeting systems. For example, AI might flag a house owned by someone linked to Hamas who does not live there. Before the house is hit, humans must confirm who is actually in it, he said.",
      "\u201cObviously there are things that I live peacefully with and things that I could have done better in some targeted attacks that I\u2019m responsible for,\u201d the soldier told the AP. \u201cIt\u2019s war, things happen, mistakes happen, we are human.\u201d",
      "Tal Mimran served 10 years as a reserve legal officer for the Israeli military, and on three NATO working groups examining the use of new technologies, including AI, in warfare. Previously, he said, it took a team of up to 20 people a day or more to review and approve a single airstrike. Now, with AI systems, the military is approving hundreds a week.",
      "Mimran said over-reliance on AI could harden people\u2019s existing biases.",
      "\u201cConfirmation bias can prevent people from investigating on their own,\u201d said Mimran, who teaches cyber law policy. \u201cSome people might be lazy, but others might be afraid to go against the machine and be wrong and make a mistake.\u201d",
      "Among U.S. tech firms, Microsoft has had an especially close relationship with the Israeli military spanning decades.",
      "That relationship, alongside those with other tech companies, stepped up after the Hamas attack. Israel\u2019s war response strained its own servers and increased its reliance on outside, third-party vendors, according to a presentation last year by the military\u2019s top information technology officer. As she described how AI had provided Israel \u201cvery significant operational effectiveness\u201d in Gaza, the logos of Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services appeared on a large screen behind her.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve already reached a point where our systems really need it,\u201d said Col. Racheli Dembinsky, commander of the Center of Computing and Information Systems, known by its Hebrew acronym, Mamram.",
      "One three-year contract between Microsoft and the Israeli Ministry of Defense began in 2021 and was worth $133 million, making it the company's second largest military customer globally after the U.S., according to a document reviewed by the AP. The Israeli military is classified within Microsoft as an \u201cS500\u201d client, meaning that it gets top priority as one of the company's most important customers globally.",
      "The Israeli military's service agreements with Microsoft include at least 635 individual subscriptions listed under specific divisions, units, bases or project code words. Subscription names reviewed by the AP included \u201cMamram\u201d and \u201c8200,\u201d an elite intelligence unit known for its technological prowess.",
      "One urgent Azure support ticket filed about two weeks after the Oct. 7 attack asked for delays of planned maintenance outages for the rest of the year due to the war, because any downtime could have \u201ca direct impact on life-saving systems.\u201d The request was flagged as being from \u201cGlilot \u2013 8200,\u201d a highly secure army base that houses Unit 8200, responsible for clandestine operations, collecting signal intelligence and code decryption, cyber warfare and surveillance.",
      "Records show Microsoft\u2019s global Azure support team responded to about 130 direct requests from the Israeli military through the first 10 months of the war. Microsoft\u2019s consulting services unit also works closely with Israel\u2019s military, which represented half of that section\u2019s overall revenue, an internal document said.",
      "Within Israel, a team of at least nine Microsoft employees is dedicated to serving the military\u2019s account. Among them is a senior executive who served 14 years in Unit 8200 and a former IT leader for military intelligence, according to their online resumes. Microsoft data is housed in server farms within two massive buildings outside Tel Aviv, enclosed behind high walls topped with barbed wire. Microsoft also operates a 46,000-square-meter corporate campus in Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv, and another office in Gav-Yam in southern Israel, which has displayed a large Israeli flag.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces has long been at the forefront of deploying artificial intelligence for military use. In early 2021, it launched Gospel, an AI tool that sorts through Israel\u2019s vast array of digitized information to suggest targets for potential strikes. It also developed Lavender, which uses machine learning to filter out requested criteria from intelligence databases and narrow down lists of potential targets, including people.",
      "Lavender ranks people between 0 and 100 based on how likely it is they are a militant, said an intelligence officer who used the systems. The ranking is based on intelligence, such as the person\u2019s family tree, if someone\u2019s father is a known militant who served time, and intercepted phone calls, he said.",
      "In May 2021, the Israeli military launched what Israeli intelligence officials described as their \u201cFirst AI War,\u201d an 11-day bombing campaign against Hamas. At the time, Israeli military officials described AI as a \u201cforce-multiplier,\u201d allowing them to carry out far more airstrikes than in prior conflicts.",
      "A 2021 post by the Israeli military also described the stakes surrounding the use of AI in war: \u201cUnlike in the realms of AdTech and Gaming, wrong decisions in the realm of intelligence may cost lives,\u201d it read. The same post described the military\u2019s incorporation of AI approaches to analyze the emotional tone of communications, a technique experts have found can fail to pick slang, jargon or nuance in people\u2019s speech.",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Marine experts have given up hope of rescuing more than 150 false killer whales that stranded on a remote beach on Australia\u2019s island state of Tasmania, officials said on Wednesday.",
      "Experts including veterinarians were at the scene on Wednesday near Arthur River on Tasmania\u2019s northwestern coast where 157 whales were discovered on an exposed surf beach on Tuesday afternoon, the Department of Natural Resources and Environment said.",
      "Unfavorable ocean and weather conditions, which prevented the whales from being rescued on Wednesday, were forecast to persist for days, incident controller Shelley Graham said.",
      "\"We have been out in the water this morning and have relocated and attempted to refloat two whales but didn\u2019t have success as the ocean conditions weren\u2019t allowing the animals to get past the break. The animals are continuously restranding,\u201d Graham said in a statement.",
      "Marine biologist Kris Carlyon said the survivors would be euthanized.",
      "\"The longer these animals are out stranded, the longer they are suffering. All alternative options have been unsuccessful,\u201d Carlyon said.",
      "The department said there were 136 survivors on Wednesday morning but that assessment was revised down to 90 within a few hours.",
      "The inaccessibility of the beach, ocean conditions and challenges to getting specialist equipment to the remote area complicated the response.",
      "The young whales weighed as little as 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds), while the adults weighed 3 metric tons (3.3 U.S. tons).",
      "Department liaison officer Brendon Clark said the stranding was the first by false killer whales in Tasmania in since 1974. That was a pod of more than 160 whales that landed on a beach near Stanley on the northwest coast. Strandings in Tasmania are usually pilot whales.",
      "Clark declined to speculate on why the latest pod might have stranded. Carcasses of dead whales would be examined for clues, he said.",
      "A helicopter reconnaissance on Tuesday afternoon determined that there were no other whales within 10 kilometers (6 miles) of the stranded pod, he said.",
      "Some could have been stranded for as long as 48 hours by early Wednesday.",
      "Arthur River local resident Jocelyn Flint said her son had discovered the stranded whales around midnight while fishing for shark.",
      "She said she had gone to the scene in the dark hours of the morning and returned after dawn but the whales were too big to attempt to refloat them.",
      "\u201cThe water was surging right up and they were thrashing. They\u2019re just dying, they\u2019ve sunk down in the sand,\u201d Flint said Wednesday morning. \u201cI think it\u2019s too late.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are little babies. Up one end, there\u2019s a lot of big ones. It\u2019s sad,\u201d she added.",
      "In 2022, 230 pilot whales stranded further south on the west coast at Macquarie Harbor.",
      "The largest mass-stranding in Australian history occurred in the same harbor in 2020 when 470 long-finned pilot whales became stuck on sandbars. Most of the beached whales died on both occasions.",
      "The reasons for the beachings are unclear. Reasons could include disorientation caused by loud noises, illness, old age, injury, fleeing predators and severe weather."

      "Both confirmed in interviews Wednesday that they had been informed by WhatsApp on Jan. 31 that their phones had been infected with the spyware. The message they received from WhatsApp suggested they contact Citizen Lab, based out of the Munk School at the University of Toronto, which has for years played a leading role in exposing state-backed hackers.",
      "Cancellato said he believed he had been targeted by hackers who wanted to see what investigative stories Fanpage was developing. He declined to speculate on who it might have been. Fanpage has published undercover reports in which journalists infiltrated the youth branch of Premier Giorgia Meloni's party and exposed neofascist behavior.",
      "Casarini, for his part, heads an aid group that rescues migrants in the Mediterranean and has criticized the Italian government's support of Libya's patrols of its coasts to prevent smugglers\u2019 boats from leaving."

      "The area, long named the Gulf of Mexico across the the world, has gained a geopolitical spotlight in recent weeks after President Donald Trump declared he would change the Gulf's name.",
      "Sheinbaum, in her morning press conference on Thursday, said the president's decree is restricted to the \u201ccontinental shelf of the United States\" because Mexico still controls much of the Gulf. \u201cWe have sovereignty over our continental shelf,\" she said.",
      "Sheinbaum said that despite the fact that her government sent a letter to Google saying that the company was \u201cwrong\u201d and that \u201cthe entire Gulf of Mexico cannot be called the Gulf of America,\" the company has insisted on maintaining the nomenclature.",
      "It was not immediately clear where such a suit would be filed.",
      "Google reported last month on its X account, formerly Twitter, that it maintains a \u201clong-standing practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources.\u201d",
      "An Associated Press analysis shows that as of Thursday, the user's location and other data was dependent on how the Gulf appeared on Google Maps. If the user is in the United States, the body of water appeared as Gulf of America. If the user was physically in Mexico, it would appear as the Gulf of Mexico. In many other countries across the world it appears as \u201cGulf of Mexico (Gulf of America).\u201d",
      "Sheinbaum has repeatedly defended the name Gulf of Mexico, saying its use dates to 1607 and is recognized by the United Nations.",
      "She has also mentioned that, according to the constitution of Apatzing\u00e1n, the antecedent to Mexico\u2019s first constitution, the North American territory was previously identified as \u201cMexican America\u201d. Sheinbaum has used the example to poke fun at Trump and underscore the international implications of changing the Gulf's name.",
      "In that sense, Sheinbaum said on Thursday that the Mexican government would ask Google to make \u201cMexican America\u201d pop up on the map when searched.",
      "This is not the first time Mexicans and Americans have disagreed on the names of key geographic areas, such as the border river between Texas and the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Le\u00f3n and Tamaulipas. Mexico calls it Rio Bravo and for the United States it is the Rio Grande.",
      "This week, the White House barred AP reporters from several events, including some in the Oval Office, saying it was because of the news agency's policy on the name. AP is using \u201cGulf of Mexico\u201d but also acknowledging Trump's renaming of it as well, to ensure that names of geographical features are recognizable around the world."

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 15:58:59 -0500",
    "summary": "Meteorologists warn that the coldest burst of Arctic air this season is coming to put an icy and prolonged exclamation point on America&rsquo;s winter of repeated polar vortex invasions starting this weekend",
    "story": [
      "Meteorologists warn that the coldest burst of Arctic air this season is coming to put an icy and prolonged exclamation point on America\u2019s winter of repeated polar vortex invasions starting this weekend",
      "The coldest burst of Arctic air this season is coming to put an icy exclamation point on America's winter of repeated polar vortex invasions, meteorologists warn. And it will stay frozen there all next week.",
      "Different weather forces in the Arctic are combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole not just into the United States, but also Europe, several meteorologists tell The Associated Press.",
      "This will be the 10th time this winter that the polar vortex \u2014 which keeps the coldest of Arctic air penned in at the top of the world \u2014 stretches like a rubber band to send some of that big chill south, said Judah Cohen, seasonal forecast director at the private firm Atmospheric and Environmental Research. In a normal winter, it happens maybe two or three times.",
      "This winter, with record snow in New Orleans and drought and destructive wildfires in Southern California, has not been normal.",
      "The latest projected cold outbreak should first hit the northern Rockies and northern Plains Saturday and then stick around all next week. The cold will likely concentrate east of the Rockies with only the far American west and central and southern Florida exempted, meteorologists said.",
      "On Tuesday, expect the Lower 48 states to have an average low of 16.6 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 8.6 Celsius), and then plunge to 14 degrees (minus 10 Celsius) on Wednesday, calculated private meteorologist Ryan Maue, a former National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief scientist.",
      "Sometime next week, 89% of the contiguous United States will be below the freezing mark and 27% of the Lower 48 will be below zero (minus 18 degrees Celsius), according to National Weather Service forecasts.",
      "Meteorologists expect strong winds to make the cold feel even worse. Every U.S. state but Hawaii, California and Florida have some or all parts forecast to have a good chance of windchills of 20 degrees or below sometime next week, the National Weather Service predicted.",
      "Kansas, Nebraska, Missouri and Iowa will have \u201cprobably the most impressive\u201d cold, with temperatures as much as 35 degrees (19 degrees Celsius) below what's normal for this time of year, said Zack Taylor, a meteorologist at the weather service's Weather Prediction Center. NOAA weather models predict Wednesday lows below zero in Oklahoma, Colorado, Nebraska, Missouri, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan.",
      "Some storms \u2014 with flooding, heavy snow or even a nor'easter \u2014 could hit during next week's prolonged cold outbreak, but details on those aren't certain yet, Taylor said.",
      "\u201cEverything, all the stars align, all the wind directions in the atmosphere are dragging the cold polar air out of the Canadian Arctic,\u201d Maue said. \u201cIt\u2019s the depths of winter. Everything signals extreme biting, winter cold. Obviously this isn\u2019t the first polar vortex episode of the winter, but it looks to be the most severe.\u201d",
      "A stretched polar vortex like this one happens lower in the atmosphere and is different than when the polar vortex has sudden warming, weakens and all the cold air escapes south and out of the poles, Cohen said. During stretching events, the polar vortex remains in place and strong, but it also just pulls and bends. Stretch outbreaks are usually slightly milder than the big polar escape events and often hit the United States, not Europe.",
      "Meteorologists are going to want to study why this stretching is happening so often this year, but it could just be natural randomness, said Laura Ciasto, a meteorologist at NOAA's Climate Prediction Center who specializes in the polar vortex.",
      "\u201cWhat we're observing right now is interesting, but not unprecedented,\u201d said Martin Stendel, a scientist at the National Center for Climate Research in Denmark.",
      "Another factor adding to the polar vortex stretching is a big blob of high pressure in the upper atmosphere over Greenland. It's moving west and will push the jet stream \u2014 the river of air that moves weather systems such as storms \u2014 into a pattern that causes polar air to plunge and stay there, Cohen said.",
      "Human-caused climate change may be making the jet stream wavier and more likely to be stuck in that wavy pattern, one of the factors involved, Stendel said.",
      "There haven't been many winters like this in the past to help meteorologists forecast what will happen next and when the cold will finally go away, Maue said.",
      "Despite the unusually cold winter across the U.S., the world remains in an overall warming pattern. Earth's average overall temperature set yet another monthly heat record in January. It was the 18th month of the last 19 that the world hit or passed the internationally agreed upon warming limit of 1.5 C (2.7 F) above pre-industrial times.",

      "The man who led a NASA facility that shouldered much of the blame for the 1986 space shuttle Challenger explosion has died",
      "William Ray Lucas, who led the NASA facility that shouldered much of the blame for the 1986 explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, has died. Lucas was 102.",
      "Lucas died Monday at his home in Huntsville, Alabama, according to an obituary published Friday by Laughlin Service Funeral Home in Huntsville. A funeral service has been set for March 1 on what would have been his 103rd birthday, funeral director Bryan Peek said Saturday.",
      "Lucas was director of the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville when the Challenger exploded on Jan. 28, 1986, just 73 seconds after liftoff from Cape Canaveral, Florida. It was the deadliest U.S. space flight disaster at that time.",
      "The explosion killed all seven crew members, including schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe, who had been tapped to become the first U.S. civilian to travel to space. Her inclusion on the flight meant thousands of schoolchildren across the country were watching the Challenger's launch and witnessed the televised disaster in real time.",
      "A presidential commission charged with investigating the cause of the explosion pointed to the shuttle's solid-fuel booster rockets as the likely culprit and criticized NASA managers for not taking safety concerns surrounding the rockets more seriously. The Marshall center had supervised development of the rockets.",
      "Lucas pushed back on the criticism, telling reporters a month after the explosion that it was too soon to pinpoint the cause of the explosion, adding, \u201cI think it was a sound decision to launch.\"",
      "But within months he had resigned, just days ahead of the release of a commission report blaming faulty design of the booster rockets.",
      "The explosion and resulting shakeup within NASA overshadowed what was an otherwise stellar career for Lucas, who was born and raised in rural western Tennessee and graduated from high school in 1939 as the class valedictorian. He earned a bachelor of science degree from Memphis State College, served in the U.S. Navy during World War II and later earned a doctorate in metallurgy from Vanderbilt University.",
      "Lucas began his career in the guided missile development division of the U.S. Army's Redstone Arsenal near Huntsville. He became a charter member of the Marshall Space Flight Center when it was established in 1960 before rising through the ranks to become its director in 1974."

      "Trump falsely claimed that Zelenskyy's public approval rating was as low as 4%.",
      "LONDON -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hit back at President Donald Trump's call for the country to hold fresh presidential elections following Tuesday's historic Russia-U.S. talks in Saudi Arabia.",
      "The U.S.-Russia talks in Riyadh -- to which Ukraine was not invited -- represented \"an important step forward\" toward ending Russia's three-year-old invasion of its neighbor, according to a State Department readout.",
      "Hours after the talks concluded, Trump told reporters at Mar-a-Lago that Zelenskyy's public approval rating was \"down to 4%,\" failing to provide a source for the figure. Russian President Vladimir Putin has also repeatedly framed Zelenskyy as illegitimate, citing the postponement of the country's 2024 presidential elections due to martial law.",
      "During a Wednesday press conference in Kyiv, Zelenskyy challenged Trump's claim, pointing to respected recent surveys showing him polling consistently above 50% with voters and describing Trump's assertion as Russian \"disinformation.\"",
      "\"If someone wants to replace me right now, then right now won't work,\" Zelenskyy said. \"If we are talking about 4% then we have seen this disinformation, we understand that it comes from Russia. And we have evidence.\"",
      "The president said he would conduct opinion polls for trust ratings for world leaders, including Trump, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan.",
      "Zelenskyy said he took Trump's comments \"calmly.\"",
      "\u201cAs for President Trump, with all due respect to him as a leader of the American people, who we deeply respect and are thankful for all his support, but President Trump, unfortunately, is living in this disinformation space,\u201d Zelenskyy continued.",
      "Hours after the U.S.-Russia discussions concluded with a commitment to continue talks, Russia launched a major missile and drone barrage into Ukraine.

      "\"Just yesterday, after the notorious meeting in Riyadh, it became clear that Russian representatives were once again lying, claiming they do not target Ukraine's energy sector,\" Zelenskyy continued.",
      "\"Yet, almost simultaneously, they launched another attack, with drones striking electrical transformers,\" he wrote. \"And this is during winter -- it was minus 6 degrees Celsius at night.\"",
      "\"We must never forget that Russia is ruled by pathological liars -- they cannot be trusted and must be pressured,\" the president said.",
      "Kyiv's exclusion from the Saudi talks have badly unsettled Ukraine and its European allies. Trump was unapologetic when speaking with reporters Tuesday at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, just as Odesa came under attack.",
      "\"They've had a seat for three years and a long time before that,\" Trump said of Ukraine, suggesting Kyiv could have made a deal with Moscow to avoid the huge loss of lives and land.",
      "Trump said he believes he has \"the power to end this war,\" while falsely claiming Ukraine started the conflict against Russia. The war began when Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbor in February 2022, a campaign that followed eight years of cross-border Russian aggression in Crimea and Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.",
      "\"I think it's going very well,\" Trump said of U.S. efforts to end the war. \"But today I heard, oh, 'Well, we weren't invited.' Well, you've been there for three years. You should have ended it three years -- you should have never started it.\"",
      "Speaking on Wednesday, Zelenskyy criticized the Trump administration's recent demand for a treaty that would hand over 50% of Ukraine's natural resources to the U.S., in exchange for no security guarantees. Trump himself has repeatedly said he wants $500 billion worth of Ukraine's rare minerals to pay back the U.S. for its support during Russia's invasion.",
      "Zelenskyy said such a demand was \"not serious\", and corrected Trump's claim that the U.S. has provided more money than Europe.",
      "\"There wasn't a word there about security guarantees,\" he said. \"There is nothing precise there. I can't sell the state.\"",
      "Zelenskyy said that if Ukraine cannot join NATO, it needs a strong army backed by Western weapons and air defense. He said Ukraine was looking for a troop contingent from European countries to help protect Ukraine after a ceasefire, but warned that Ukraine's own troops needed to be backed by air defense, which only the U.S. can provide.",
      "\"Only the Americans, President Donald Trump, have this protection, this air defense, it's exclusively from them, and that's what's important,\" Zelenskyy said. \"We have a map that shows us this, but we are ready for dialogue, for discussion, about what quantity, how much is needed. We've calculated everything; we've figured it all out. So this is essentially the main point of what we are requesting.\"",
      "Zelenskyy suggested on Tuesday that the U.S.-Russia talks in Riyadh merely revived ultimatums issued by Moscow in the early stages of its invasion.",
      "\"I have the impression that there are now some negotiations happening and they have the same mood, but between Russia and the United States,\" Zelenskyy said during a visit to Turkey.",
      "\"Again, about Ukraine without Ukraine,\" he added. \"It's interesting, if Ukraine didn't yield to ultimatums in the most difficult moment, where does the feeling come from that Ukraine will agree to this now?\"",
      "\"I never intended to yield to Russia's ultimatums and I don't intend to now,\" Zelenskyy added.",
      "In Riyadh, the U.S. and Russia agreed to appoint as-yet unnamed special representatives to continue peace talks, according to the Russian Foreign Ministry.",
      "Addressing the Russian parliament on Wednesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov -- who led Moscow's team in Riyadh -- told lawmakers that \"the atmosphere is positive, the intentions are correct, we will see how the situation develops further, what decisions will be made.\"",
      "He added, \"The main thing is to meet, listen and hear, make decisions that will be realistic.\"",
      "Putin aide Yuri Ushakov told the state-controlled Channel One television channel that Trump's Ukraine-Russia envoy -- Keith Kellogg -- would negotiate a settlement with Kyiv and European nations.",
      "Kellogg arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday morning, where he is expected to hold talks with Ukrainian leaders.",
      "Kellogg told reporters his \"mission is to sit and listen\" and then report back to Trump. He parried questions about whether Trump is siding with Putin, saying that Trump wants to end the war because \"he understands the human suffering\" it is causing.",
      "Kellogg added that he agrees with Trump that the war would never have begun if he had been president at the time.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 05:34:16 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration said that Guantanamo would house the most violent undocumented migrants -- but relatives of some detainees say they don't have criminal records.",
    "story": [
      "Family of two detainees, despite DHS claims, say they have no criminal records.",
      "Early this month, as part of President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration, the first flight carrying \"high threat\" migrants landed at Guantanamo Bay, home of the notorious U.S. prison camp that administration officials said would house the most violent \"worst of the worst\" migrants apprehended on American soil.",
      "ABC News, however, has spoken with the families of two migrants who say they're being held there despite having no criminal record.",
      "\"President Donald Trump has been very clear: Guantanamo Bay will hold the worst of the worst. That starts today,\" said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem after releasing photos of the migrants boarding a C-17 military plane in Texas on Feb 4.",
      "The move followed an executive order by Trump directing the secretaries of the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security to \"expand the Migrant Operations Center at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay to full capacity\" for \"high-priority criminal aliens unlawfully present in the United States.\"",
      "\"There's a lot of space to accommodate a lot of people,\" Trump said in the Oval Office last month when he signed the order. \"So we're going to use it.\"",
      "But in the weeks that have followed, as more migrants have been sent to Guantanamo, immigrant advocacy groups and some relatives of those detained claim the administration has provided no evidence that those detained are \"high-threat\" -- and that people are being sent to the military base without access to legal counsel or the ability to communicate with relatives.",
      "\"It's troubling enough that we are even sending immigrants from the U.S. to Guantanamo, but it's beyond the pale that we are holding them incommunicado, without access to attorneys, family or the outside world,\" said Lee Gelernt, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union.",
      "A federal lawsuit, filed in Washington, D.C., last week and backed by the ACLU, says this is the first time in U.S. history that the government has detained noncitizens on civil immigration charges at the U.S. naval base in Cuba.",
      "A DHS spokesperson told ABC News last week that in addition to holding violent gang members and other \"high-threat\" migrants, the military is also holding other undocumented migrants with final deportation orders.",
      "An ABC News review of 53 Guantanamo detainees whose names were published by The New York Times found federal cases associated with 14 of the names. That number does not account for possible variations in spelling, nor does it include any possible state cases.",
      "According to federal court records, among those cases, one individual was charged with assaulting, resisting, or impeding an officer during a riot at a detention center. Another was charged for allegedly being involved in an \"illegal alien smuggling scheme,\" and one was charged with \"intentionally conspiring to transport\" undocumented people in Texas.",
      "In the other federal cases ABC News found, the individuals were charged for entry or illegal reentry into the U.S., a criminal offense.",
      "ABC News spoke with the families of two migrants who are in Guantanamo, who claimed their detained relatives do not have ties to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua or other criminal groups as authorities have alleged.",
      "A senior DHS official told ABC News the two migrants are members of Tren De Aragua, but did not elaborate or offer any details.",
      "\"There is a system for phone utilization to reach lawyers,\" added the official. \"If the AMERICAN Civil Liberties Union cares more about highly dangerous criminal aliens including murderers & vicious gang members than they do about American citizens -- they should change their name.\"",
      "The family members said they believe their relatives were unfairly targeted because of their tattoos.",
      "\"He told us he was being targeted because of his tattoos ... he was accused of being part of Tren de Aragua, but that is not true,\" said Barbara Simancas, the sister of Jose Rodriguez Simancas who is reportedly one of the migrants in Guantanamo. \"His tattoos have nothing to do with that ... they are of his children's names.\"",
      "Barbara Simancas told ABC News that her brother last spoke to a relative on Feb. 4 to let them know he was being transferred to the military base in Cuba the next day. She said her brother surrendered to authorities after crossing the southern border last year and claiming asylum, and that he was placed in a detention center in El Paso, Texas.",
      "Barbara Simancas maintains her brother does not have a criminal record and provided to ABC News a criminal background check from Venezuela.",
      "Rodriguez Simancas was charged with \"improper entry\" into the U.S. in May 2024. Court records obtained by ABC News noted that he has \"no criminal history\" other than the improper entry to which he pleaded guilty.",
      "Barbara Simancas said she has not been able to get in touch with ICE or DHS since her brother was sent to Guantanamo.",
      "\"I just ask the government to send him back to Venezuela,\" Simancas said. \"His kids are worried. They want to see their dad.\"",
      "ABC News also spoke with Jhoan Lee Bastidas, the father of Jhoan Lee Bastidas Paz, who is being held at Guantanamo Bay. He was charged with \"improper entry\" into the U.S. in November 2023 and pleaded guilty. Court records also indicate he has \"no criminal history\" besides that charge.",
      "Lee Bastidas told ABC News he found out about his son's detention when his other son saw a photo on social media of Bastidas Paz on a military flight to Guantanamo.",
      "\"When I saw the photo of him, I said 'Oh my God,'\" said Lee Bastidas, who told ABC News that his son's name was also in the list of Guantanamo detainees published by the Times.",
      "\"We're thinking the worst things because on social media, they say Guantanamo is the worst ... that it's where they house the terrorists,\" Lee Bastidas said. \"I am tormented.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Feb 2025 19:15:43 -0500",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that aims to help families hoping to expand their families through in vitro fertilization by reducing costs for the procedure",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that aims to help families hoping to expand their families through in vitro fertilization by reducing costs for the procedure",
      "President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed an executive order aiming to reduce the costs of in vitro fertilization, a medical procedure that helps people facing infertility build their families.",
      "\u201cAmericans need reliable access to IVF and more affordable treatment options, as the cost per cycle can range from $12,000 to $25,000,\u201d the order said. \u201cProviding support, awareness, and access to affordable fertility treatments can help these families navigate their path to parenthood with hope and confidence.\u201d",
      "The order instructed the assistant to the president for domestic policy to give Trump a list of policy recommendations on protecting IVF access and \u201caggressively reducing out-of-pocket and health plan costs for IVF treatment\u201d within 90 days.",
      "IVF became a talking point during the 2024 presidential campaign when Alabama agreed to protect in vitro fertilization providers from legal liability a couple of weeks after the state Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law.",
      "Trump said at the time he strongly supported its availability. And a June poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that about 6 in 10 U.S. adults support protecting access to IVF, with 26% neutral and about 1 in 10 opposed.",
      "In 2018, assisted reproductive technology, including IVF, contributed to 2% of all infants born in the United States, according to a report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about this increasingly common fertility treatment.",
      "The procedure offers a possible solution when a woman has trouble getting pregnant, and it's normally tried after other, less expensive fertility treatments have failed.",
      "It involves retrieving the woman's eggs and combining them in a lab dish with a man\u2019s sperm to create a fertilized embryo, which is then transferred into her uterus in an attempt to create a pregnancy.",
      "IVF is done in cycles and may take more than one. The procedure can use a couple\u2019s eggs and sperm or those from a donor.",
      "Insurance coverage of IVF and other fertility treatments can be patchy and depends on who provides insurance for the patient.",
      "More large employers are offering the coverage to attract and keep workers. Many businesses also are extending coverage beyond those with an infertility diagnosis, making it accessible to LGBTQ+ couples and single women.",
      "Government-funded programs such as Medicaid largely limit fertility treatment coverage. Coverage is less common among smaller employers.",
      "Critics have said the lack of widespread coverage creates a divide, limiting treatments mainly to people who can pay thousands of dollars out of pocket.",
      "The first baby conceived through IVF was born in 1978 in England. But the first in the U.S. was in 1981 in Norfolk, Virginia, with the birth of Elizabeth Carr.",
      "Her mother, Judith Carr, had had three abnormal pregnancies, forcing the removal of her fallopian tubes. She and her husband sought treatment from Howard and Georgeanna Jones, doctors who opened a fertility clinic at Eastern Virginia Medical School.",
      "The Norfolk clinic faced resistance before it even opened. When it sought a required state certificate in 1979, more than 600 people jammed into a public hearing. Several women voiced support for IVF and testified about wanting to start a family, while anti-abortion groups raised concerns about doctors interfering with human conception and embryos being discarded.",
      "Despite proposed state legislation to stop the clinic, it opened in 1980, with others following soon afterward in California, Tennessee and Texas. By 1988, at least 169 in vitro centers were operating in 41 states.",
      "The use of IVF continued to grow, but sentiments against it never really went away in the American anti-abortion movement, said Margaret Marsh, a history professor at Rutgers University in New Jersey.",
      "Many abortion opponents had made an uneasy peace with the technology as a treatment for infertility, Marsh said. But opposition to IVF has gained momentum since the overturn of Roe v. Wade in 2022.",
      "\u201cNot everyone in the anti-abortion movement opposes these reproductive technologies, but many do,\" she said.",
      "The treatment often uses hormones to trigger ovulation so multiple eggs are produced and a needle is used to remove them from the ovaries.",
      "Eggs can be fertilized by adding the sperm to the eggs in a lab, or a single sperm can be injected into each egg.",
      "The fertilized egg is cultured over about five to six days to create the blastocyst \u2014 the early stage of an embryo \u2014 and is either transferred or stored for future use, said Dr. Jason Griffith, a reproductive endocrinologist in Houston.",
      "Griffith said that on day three after fertilization, an embryo is anywhere from six to 10 cells. By day six, it\u2019s between 100 and 300 cells. In comparison, he said, a person contains more than 1 trillion cells.",
      "Frozen embryos can be used for future pregnancies, and the vast majority survive the thawing process.",
      "The freezing process involves replacing the water in embryo cells with a protectant fluid and flash-freezing with liquid nitrogen, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine.",
      "Frozen embryos are stored in tanks containing liquid nitrogen at hospital labs or reproductive medicine centers. Griffith said they can also be kept in storage facilities contracted by health care facilities, especially when they are stored for many years. Frozen embryos can be safely preserved for a decade or more.",
      "Griffith said conditions are monitored in these facilities and there are physical security mechanisms to safeguard the tanks and backup generators in case of power outages.",

    "story": [
      "Numerous studies show no link between the childhood vaccine schedule and autism.",
      "Freshly confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told a room packed with federal health workers on Tuesday that he plans to \"investigate\" whether the timing of childhood vaccinations and anti-depression medications are among several \"possible factors\" in the nation's problem with chronic diseases.",
      "\"Nothing is going to be off limits,\" Kennedy told the large crowd Tuesday.",
      "The campaign-style speech at the Department of Health and Human Services headquarters was intended for staff only, although a livestream link was circulated. Staff was invited to meet him afterward, and an emailed invitation sent earlier to HHS workers noted \"selfies are welcome!\"",
      "Kennedy's offer of selfies with staff came amid widespread firings and resignations across the federal government were underway, including at HHS. Agency officials have not provided details on the firings, including what the impact there could be.",
      "According to people familiar with the effort, some 700 employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were fired late last week.",
      "Kennedy urged staff to keep an \"open mind\" on Tuesday as he planned to turn the agency's vast resources to revisit matters considered as settled science.",
      "\"We will convene representatives of all viewpoints to study the causes for the drastic rise in chronic disease,\" Kennedy said. \"Some of the possible factors we will investigate were formally taboo or insufficiently scrutinized.\"",
      "He then gave a list of these \"possible factors\" to investigate including the childhood vaccine schedule and \"SSRI and other psychiatric drugs,\" referring to federally approved drugs that help treat such conditions as depression and anxiety.",
      "Studies do not suggest vaccines or SSRIs are to blame for chronic illnesses, such as autism or obesity. Critics argue Kennedy's rhetoric could create more doubt and public mistrust of these medicines.",
      "Also on his list was electromagnetic radiation, herbicides and pesticides, ultra-processed foods, artificial food, allergies, microplastics and long-lasting chemicals used in the production of non-stick pans. Scientists are actively exploring the possible health impacts of environmental toxins, with some studies suggesting they could play a role in chronic illnesses.",
      "Kennedy's willingness to revisit the childhood vaccine schedule appears to be at odds with his Senate testimony in January in which he told skeptical lawmakers that he specifically supported federal recommendations.",
      "\"I support vaccines. I support the vaccine schedule. I support good science,\" Kennedy testified last month.",
      "Vaccinating infants and young children is widely recommended as a way to prevent kids from being exposed to life-threatening diseases like measles and to protect other children in school.",
      "Kennedy has previously pushed a debunked claim that vaccines cause autism, despite numerous large-scale studies finding no connection.",

      "At issue is Trump\u2019s Jan. 27 executive order that directed the DOD to update its guidance \"regarding trans-identifying medical standards for military service and to rescind guidance inconsistent with military readiness.\" While the Department of Defense has not issued final guidance on transgender service members, the order led to a pause in gender affirming care for service members and is expected to lead to a significant curtailment of transgender service members based on \u201creadiness and lethality.\"",
      "With the DOD policy expected to be finalized over the coming week, Reyes said she would hold off on issuing an order but had largely made up her mind about the legality of the order, at one point remarking that \u201csmarter people on the D.C. Circuit would have to tell me I\u2019m wrong\u201d about the policy. She added that the central premise of the executive order -- that only two genders exist -- is \u201cnot biologically correct.\u201d",

      "\u201cI have no idea, Your Honor,\u201d said DOJ attorney Jason Lynch.",
      "\u201cI do. He would say, 'Of course it is.' Because he calls it a transgender ban, because all the language in it is indicative,\u201d Reyes said.",

    "summary": "The Diplomatic Security Service has not been exempted, as have other agencies, from the administration's downsizing plans.",
    "story": [
      "It's unclear how much deeper the cuts at the agency may go.",
      "The Trump administration has embarked on a bold and controversial plan to streamline and downsize the federal government, in part by eliminating newer federal employee positions. In his executive order from Feb. 11, he lays out the parameters of the review and downsizing by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) but has clear exclusions for military personnel as well as \"any position they deem necessary to meet national security, homeland security, or public safety responsibilities\" or other necessary exemptions.",
      "Despite those clear exceptions, it seems at least one department has not excepted its law enforcement personnel, the State Department\u2019s Diplomatic Security Service (DSS).",
      "DSS personnel are the proverbial \u201ctip of the spear\u201d when it comes to international diplomacy and emergency response. This very small agency, established in 1985 in response to a number of terrorist attacks and threats around the world including the deadly 1983 bombings of the U.S. embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut, operates in every corner of the globe. It has been responsible for helping evacuate U.S. personnel in Kabul as well as helping locate and identify Americans held hostage by Hamas.",
      "The agency's often unheralded mission is protecting American embassies, personnel and citizens abroad, protecting the secretary of state and other visiting dignitaries in the United States as well as investigating visa and passport fraud, child exploitation, human and drug trafficking, financial fraud and identity theft.",
      "Another critical aspect of DSS work is in the field of counterintelligence. Due to the agency's position as the regional security officer (RSO) in embassies around the world, DSS personnel acquire relationships with host nations' law enforcement, military and intelligence apparatuses. They are also the first to meet with individuals who come to U.S. embassies with potential intelligence information on fugitives or others.",
      "DSS clearly meets the exemption under Trump's Feb. 11 executive order, yet the State Department and DSS leadership have been silent in light of the firing of its personal services contractors, including the civilian security contractors, training instructors, bomb techs, explosive ordnance technicians and K9 personnel and counter-surveillance contract units that supplement DSS at every U.S. embassy.",
      "In Benghazi, Libya, three of the four people killed in the 2012 terror attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission there were civilian contractors and former U.S. military special forces \u2013 Sean Smith, Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty. So, the firings seem counter to the exceptions that downsizing would include law enforcement personnel who perform an essential national security function for the U.S. government.",
      "In light of the firings, it is also unclear how much further cuts may go, despite DSS being asked to do more in other executive orders, including border security.",
      "In the executive order \"Protecting the American People Against Invasion,\" the secretary of state, in coordination with the attorney general and the secretary of homeland security are tasked with prioritizing the prosecution of offenses related to the unauthorized entry and presence of undocumented migrants in the United States. DSS is the team that investigates and enforces both passport and visa fraud cases for the United States, which often have tremendous investigative value.",
      "The \"Designating Cartels And Other Organizations As Foreign Terrorist Organizations And Specially Designated Global Terrorists\" executive order will also have DSS agents at the center of their efforts.",
      "The order titled \"Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and other National Security and Public Safety Threats,\" mandates enhanced vetting and screening of individuals and that also falls to DSS.",
      "But while other federal law enforcement agencies including the Drug Enforcement Administration, US Marshal\u2019s Service and Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms have been told that they clearly are exempt from the mass downsizing and reorganization, the State Department and specifically DSS leadership have not commented.",
      "In an email to DSS leadership on Feb. 12, 2024, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association DSS representative stated: \u201cDespite guidance urging personnel to rely on official communications, the absence of headquarters messaging on these matters has fueled speculation and uncertainty among our agents. The lack of clarity has led to an increase in FLEOA membership, as DSS personnel - once confident in their career stability - now seek legal support to prepare for potential adverse actions.\u201d",
      "In a world that seems more dangerous, with nefarious foreign actors, states, terrorists, plots and wars occurring in different regions of the world, DSS personnel are critical to maintaining U.S. national security presence and keeping U.S. embassies and American citizens safe. Cutting that law enforcement agency in any way will only do one thing, diminish our foreign policy goals and American security.",

      "President Donald Trump is going further than ever before to enforce his decisions",
      "WASHINGTON -- Months into his first term as president, Donald Trump was furious with the snowballing Russia investigation and ordered White House Counsel Don McGahn to make sure that special counsel Robert Mueller got fired.",
      "\u201cMueller has to go,\u201d McGahn recalled Trump saying. \u201cCall me back when you do it.\u201d",
      "But McGahn didn\u2019t do it, and Trump didn\u2019t even bring it up the next time they saw each other. Such incidents were common during Trump\u2019s initial experience in the White House, where officials would soften or ignore his most outrageous decisions and the president seemed unwilling to enforce his will.",
      "It\u2019s hard to imagine the same thing happening during Trump\u2019s second term. Instead of repeating his laissez-faire attitude toward his own administration, the Republican president is asserting control at every opportunity, backed up by loyalists at all levels of government. Despite occasional disorganization and confusion, there's a headstrong determination to push through any obstacles.",
      "Trump doesn't just want to change course from Joe Biden's presidency, his team is holding back congressionally authorized funding championed by his predecessor.",
      "Not only did Trump officials tell the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to stop working, his team set up a tip line so people could report unauthorized actions taken by staff at the agency.",
      "Trump wasn\u2019t satisfied with simply firing all the board members at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. He made himself chairman.",
      "This time, Trump seems to be saying, his orders will not be ignored. This time, there will be follow through.",
      "The White House summarizes Trump's approach with the mantra \u201cpromises made, promises kept.\u201d Administration officials also dismiss concerns that the president is exercising too much control. They say Trump is entitled to impose his vision on the government that he was elected to lead.",
      "Others see something darker and more menacing for the country and its future.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s instincts haven\u2019t changed,\" said Timothy Naftali, a Columbia University historian. \"He\u2019s just angrier, meaner and more effective than he was in his first term.\u201d",
      "Trump often felt like he was undermined in his first term by the \u201cdeep state,\u201d a term used by his allies to describe civil servants and career officials. Now, he's moving swiftly to cut the federal bureaucracy with the help of Elon Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur Trump has empowered to oversee the downsizing of the workforce.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve never had a president come into office with such a deep desire for revenge,\" Naftali said. \u201cDonald Trump is trying to hollow out institutions that he thinks embarrassed him.\"",
      "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was created to protect Americans from financial fraud, abuse and deceptive practices, has been brought to a standstill. The U.S. Agency for International Development, a leading distributor of humanitarian assistance, was shut down.",
      "A prime target is the Department of Justice, which infuriated Trump by investigating him during his first term and after leaving office. He was indicted twice by federal authorities, although the cases were dropped after he won last year's election because sitting presidents can't be prosecuted while in office.",
      "Now Trump has placed loyalists in leadership positions, such as Emil Bove, the acting deputy attorney general who was previously Trump's defense attorney.",
      "Last week, Bove pushed to drop corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, saying it was more important for Adams to help Trump enact stricter immigration policies.",
      "\u201cThe pending prosecution has unduly restricted Mayor Adams\u2019 ability to devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime that escalated under the policies of the prior Administration,\u201d Bove wrote.",
      "Several prosecutors in New York and Washington resigned in protest, and a court hearing is scheduled for Wednesday.",
      "Trump said that he wasn't involved in the decision to drop the case against Adams, but he's previously said that the mayor had been unfairly targeted for political reasons.",
      "Another example of Trump's heavy-handed approach this time has been his handling of criminal charges against supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Hours after taking the oath of office a month ago, the president pardoned roughly 1,500 people, including those who attacked police officers.",
      "Then his administration decided to push even further. Thousands of FBI employees are being questioned about their role in Jan. 6 investigations, with suggestions that they could face punishment.",
      "Bove said agents \u201cwho simply followed orders and carried out their duties in an ethical manner\u201d were not at risk, adding that \u201cthe only individuals who should be concerned ... are those who acted with corrupt or partisan intent.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a sharp change from Trump\u2019s first administration, which included a number of establishment figures who resisted his impulses.",
      "Olivia Troye, a former national security official who has been a critic of Trump, said staff members would confer with each other after meetings with the president.",
      "\u201cWhy don\u2019t you hold on that before you go do something, and let\u2019s see what happens,\u201d Troye recalled people saying. \u201cLet\u2019s see if it passes.\u201d",
      "The mixed signals were partly a matter of inexperience. The president and some of his advisers had never served in government.",
      "\u201cDuring the first administration, quite frankly, they had no idea what they were doing,\" Troye said. \"Now they have people in place who were there the first time around. They\u2019ve been preparing to execute for several years.\u201d",
      "Trump has taken a scorched-earth approach to uprooting diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, commonly known as DEI. He's signed executive orders to end the programs, but that wasn't enough for his administration.",
      "Messages distributed by the Office of Personnel Management, which functions as the human resources agency for the federal government, said employees should not try to \u201cdisguise these programs by using coded or imprecise language.\u201d",
      "Anyone who sees evidence of DEI should immediately disclose it.",
      "\u201cThere will be no adverse consequences for timely reporting this information,\" the messages said. \u201cHowever, failure to report this information within 10 days may result in adverse consequences.\u201d",

      "A hearing Tuesday ended without the judge deciding on a restraining order.",
      "A federal judge did not issue a ruling following a hearing Tuesday at which five unions sought a temporary restraining order to keep the Trump administration from carrying out mass layoffs across the federal government.",
      "The suit, filed last week by a coalition of five federal workers' unions, in one of several lawsuits challenging Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency's large-scale effort to slash the federal workforce.",
      "The judge said he intends to rule on the restraining order \"sooner than later.\"",
      "The suit alleges that the Trump administration's ongoing effort to fire massive numbers of federal employees across multiple agencies -- including its recent deferred resignation offer to more than 2 million federal employees -- violates Congress' power to establish a federal workforce, as well as federal procedures that dictate how the workforce should be reduced.",
      "\"The Executive Branch acting as the 'woodchipper for bureaucracy' conflicts with Congress's role as the creator, funder, and mission setter for the executive branch agencies,\" the lawsuit said.",
      "The unions, which represent hundreds of thousands of employees across dozens of federal agencies and departments, are seeking a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, claiming that the mass reduction of the federal work force will lead to a \"critical\" loss of revenues for unions as well as their influence at the bargaining table.",
      "The National Treasury Employees Union, the unions claimed, stands to lose \"as much as half of its dues revenue and around half of the workers that it represents.\"",
      "Lawyers with the Department of Justice have pushed back against the allegations, arguing that an order blocking the changes would \"interfere with the President's ability to manage, shape, and streamline the federal workforce to more closely reflect policy preferences and the needs of the American public.\"",
      "\"[T]he President is charged with directing the Executive Branch workforce, and he has determined that the politically accountable heads of his agencies should take steps to streamline and modernize the workforce through measures including voluntary deferred resignations, removal of certain probationary employees, and RIFs [reductions in force],\" the Justice Department wrote in a court filing.",
      "The government also claimed that President Donald Trump's executive action ordering the reductions is \"consistent with applicable law,\" and dismissed the unions' concerns over their potential loss of revenues and bargaining power as \"speculative.\"",
      "Since Trump returned to the White House, Musk, named by Trump as the head of DOGE, has been spearheading efforts to reduce the size of government, slash thousands of federal contracts, cut programs deemed to be wasteful, and root out fraud.",
      "After ending its deferred resignation offer last week amid court battles challenging the program, the Trump administration has begun layoffs by targeting mostly probationary employees -- recent hires who joined the federal workforce within the last one to two years, depending on the agency, and have fewer protections.",
      "This initial round of layoffs could impact more than 200,000 workers hired by the federal government within the last two years, according to data from the Office of Personnel Management.",

      "The impact of those bans have even spread to states where abortion is still legal, the studies showed.",
      "In the first study, Johns Hopkins researchers found that birth rates rose 1.7% in states with abortion bans. It showed that the bans primarily affect racial minorities, younger individuals and those with lower income or education, especially in the South.",
      "\"Those experiencing the greatest structural disadvantages and in the states amongst the worst in maternal and child health outcomes experience the greatest impact of these abortion bans on the number of live births,\u201d Suzanne Bell, PhD, MPH, the paper\u2019s lead author and an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told ABC News.",
      "\u201cMany of these occurred in states with among the weakest social services and worst outcomes, potentially deepening existing disparities and placing additional burdens on already strained resources,\u201d she said.",
      "At the same time, infant deaths rose in states with abortion bans, according to another Johns Hopkins study. Analyzing birth and death records from 2012 to 2023, Bell\u2019s team noted 478 more infant deaths than expected in 14 states with the bans. The highest increases were seen in Black infants (about an 11% higher death rate), infants in Southern states and infants born with severe medical conditions.",
      "\u201cWhen you look at Texas' contribution to the overall findings, we see that Texas is responsible for 73% of the additional births and 80% of the excess infant deaths,\u201d Bell said.",
      "But states without bans have also felt the effects.",
      "Abortion also rose in Colorado, a state that maintained access to abortion with no gestational limits, according to a research letter recently published in JAMA Network Open.",
      "Colorado State University researchers found that abortions for out-of-state residents in Colorado rose from 13% in 2020 to 30% in 2023. Abortions among Colorado residents also peaked six months after Texas\u2019 abortion ban, with an 11% increase in first-trimester abortions and an 83% increase in second-trimester abortions compared to before the ban.",
      "The surge in demand led to delays, possibly raising costs, emotional toll and procedure complexity, the authors said. However, second-trimester abortions have since stabilized, possibly due to expanded telehealth, self-managed abortions and access in other states, they added.",
      "Currently, abortion is illegal in 12 states, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, and 29 states have some sort of abortion limitation based on gestational age. Nine states have no restriction on abortion.",
      "\u201cThe literature we have demonstrates that not being able to obtain an abortion has negative physical, mental and economic implications for birthing persons, their children and their families -- and undermines achieving health equity,\u201d Bell said. \u201cThese bans are deepening or worsening some of these existing population health disparities that exist.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Kamala Harris faced strong opposition from the community over the war in Gaza.",
      "While President Donald Trump's comments about wanting to \"clean out\" Gaza and forcibly displace its nearly 2 million Palestinians have stirred outrage and accusations of ethnic cleansing among U.S. allies and international law experts, some members of the Arab American community still believe he was a better choice than Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "\"I don't regret having supported the president. He promised us an end to the war, and he was able to get a ceasefire for us in Gaza, and for that we are grateful. Imagine how many hundreds of Palestinians we've been able to save because of the ceasefire,\" Bishara Bahbah, the chairman for Arab Americans for Peace told ABC News.",
      "Israel and Hamas reached a ceasefire-hostage exchange deal five days before Trump was sworn into office. Both President Joe Biden and Trump have taken credit for the ceasefire deal.",
      "The Biden-Harris administration faced criticism from the Arab American community due to its perceived unconditional support for Israel in its war on Gaza. More than 48,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the war began after Hamas' surprise attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killed 1,200 people and hundreds more were taken captive.",
      "\"President Biden was asleep at the wheel, ignoring our our pleas with him. So we decided to tell President Biden that because you have ignored us, we are going to punish you at the polls, and that's one of the major reasons why we decided to establish Arab Americans for Trump,\" Bahbah said.",
      "Many prominent Arab-American advocacy groups and community leaders threw their support behind Trump or Green Party candidate Jill Stein due to the Biden administration's stance on Gaza.",
      "\"For many people, this was very painful. This was not an easy choice, because they were looking at what was going on in Gaza, it was very hard for them to support President Biden,\" and later Vice President Harris, James Zoghby, the cofounder of the Arab American Institute, a political and policy organization that did not support Trump, told ABC News.",
      "Now, with Trump proposing the forcible displacement of Palestinians, and attempting to pressure Egypt and Jordan to take in Palestinians from Gaza -- by threatening to cut billions in aid -- some groups have maintained their support of Trump and are waiting to see what actions he takes and are maintaining their opposition to Harris and Biden.",
      "\"These were grotesque comments. They're unacceptable comments, they're absolutely horrific comments. But you know, at the end of the day, when you put them on a scale, they're comments. It's rhetoric, and I don't feel it is appropriate, nor is it honest to sit here and conflate it with the actions of the Biden-Harris administration, or to try and use that rhetoric to use it as a 'gotcha' moment to people who voted against the Biden-Harris administration,\" Hudhayfah Ahmad, the head of media for the Abandon Harris campaign, told ABC News.",
      "The Abandon Harris campaign, which started as the Abandon Biden campaign, gave both Democratic Party candidates an ultimatum, asking for them to call for an unconditional ceasefire or lose the group's support. Biden and Harris did not meet the deadline set by the group to call for a ceasefire, according to Ahmad.",
      "The Trump campaign was able to garner support from the Muslim American community largely in the last four weeks before the election by making public calls for a ceasefire and vowing to make it happen, Ahmad said.",
      "\"There was never really any support before that,\" Ahmad said.",
      "\"A considerable chunk of people who had previously committed to voting third party, said that I'm going to vote the Trump-Vance ticket at the top of the ticket, and I'll vote Green Party down ballot. I heard this from multiple people in multiple swing states,\" Ahmad said.",
      "But some community leaders felt that despite the actions of the Biden Administration in Gaza, Trump would be worse.",
      "\"I was very much opposed to the hucksters who were trying to sell Jill Stein and to the folks who supported Donald Trump. It was a really not just a bad call, it was a dangerous call. And I felt that despite the insult, despite the hurt, we had a responsibility to think big. [Biden and Harris] were at fault for making our job more difficult,\" Zoghby said.",
      "\"The pain that we knew would occur if Donald Trump got back into the White House was too great to too many people,\" Zoghby said. \"Even though [Biden and Harris] didn't give us what we needed, we still had to recognize that letting Donald Trump back into the White House was was going to be a disaster.\"",
      "Arab Americans for Peace -- an advocacy group formerly called Arab Americans for Trump -- changed its name this month after hearing some of Trump's rhetoric surrounding the displacement of Palestinians, but a leader told ABC News they have not yet withdrawn their support for Trump.",
      "\"Our objective from the very beginning for supporting Trump was peace. We were telling the Biden administration continuously to stop its aid to the Israelis because the Israelis are committing genocide with the arms that are provided by the United States and Western Europe,\" Bahbah said.",
      "\"The change of the name does not mean that we are withdrawing our support for President Trump. It just means that we are going back to the root cause of our very existence, which is the promotion of peace in the Middle East,\" Bahbah said.",
      "Even community leaders who did not support Trump as a candidate argued that he secured a ceasefire.",
      "\"Trump did this ceasefire solely for his own self interest and self image and self benefit. Nothing humanitarian about it at all,\" Ahmad said.",
      "\"It's hard to say that anyone feels regret [for supporting Trump] when you take into consideration that we are no longer seeing a daily influx of videos and pictures of children, men, women, elderly, being butchered with U.S. weaponry. That has stopped completely,\" Ahmad said.",
      "Despite some holding onto support for Trump, his comments on forcibly displacing Palestinians drew sharp criticism from Arab Americans.",
      "\"We are totally opposed to the idea of displacing Palestinians out of Gaza. Gaza belongs to the Palestinians, and it is not for anyone in the world to tell the Palestinians to leave that territory,\" Bahbah said.",
      "\"Like my father, Palestinians are prepared to die on their homeland. And will not immigrate or be forced out of their homeland,\" Bahbah said.",
      "Bahbah said there is still time to see how Trump's rhetoric will play out in the Middle East, but said the next four years will be critical for the Israel-Arab conflict.",
      "He said Arab Americans for Peace decided to support Trump because he promised to end the war in Gaza and ensure lasting peace in the Middle East.",
      "He believes Trump's pressure on Netanyahu stopped the war in Gaza.",
      "But Bahbah said he believes Trump's recent comments on Gaza are providing Israel cover to \"destroy\" the West Bank, drawing attention away from what is happening there.",
      "Other leaders in the Arab community strongly disagreed with Trump's comments on Gaza, and are skeptical of the motivations behind Trump's comments on wanting to forcibly displace Palestinians.",
      "\"I think the purpose is to provide Netanyahu the cover to end this ceasefire after phase one and secure the hostages and go no further. Because I don't think Trump is interested at all in seeing this through on the terms that were negotiated -- which ultimately requires a full Israeli withdrawal and the reconstruction,\" Zoghby said.",
      "Netanyahu has faced criticism for not laying out a plan for what happens in Gaza after the war is over. The ceasefire agreement requires a complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, but remains unclear if the ceasefire will reach its final stages.",
      "\"I could get as indignant as everybody else about [Trump's comments] and it being illegal, but there's so much in that involves Israel's behavior toward Palestinians -- and the U.S.'s enablement of Israel doing it -- that is illegal, immoral,\" Zoghby said.",
      "Now they are awaiting on Trump to deliver lasting peace, Bahbah said.",
      "\"We continue to insist and be a voice of reason, telling the president what we want as an Arab American community, and that is lasting peace in the Middle East based on a two state solution, keeping in mind that what brought us to this point is the Biden-Harris administration by allowing Israel to literally destroy the Gaza Strip,\" Bahbah said.",
      "But support for Trump is conditional on what actions he takes, some activists say.",
      "\"We are not beholden to anybody or to any party. We will support whomever we think will end the wars and provide a permanent resolution to the Arab Israeli conflict and peace in the Middle East,\" Bahbah said.",
      "The group Abandon Harris plans to throw its support behind third-party candidates in the future, Ahmad said.",
      "\"Our movement is solely structured behind morals, values, principles -- not parties, not individuals, not candidates,\" Ahmad said.",

      "The Trump administration is falsely claiming that tens of millions of dead people over 100 years old are receiving improper Social Security payments",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is falsely claiming that tens of millions of dead people over 100 years old are receiving Social Security payments.",
      "Over the past few days, President Donald Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk have said on social media and in press briefings that people who are 100, 200 and even 300 years old are improperly getting benefits \u2014 a \u201cHUGE problem,\u201d Musk wrote, as his Department of Government Efficiency digs into federal agencies to root out waste, fraud and abuse.",
      "It is true that improper payments have been made, including some to dead people. But the numbers thrown out by Musk and the White House are overstated and misrepresent Social Security data.",
      "Here are the facts:",
      "On Tuesday, Trump said at a press briefing in Florida that \u201cwe have millions and millions of people over 100 years old\u201d receiving Social Security benefits. \u201cThey\u2019re obviously fraudulent or incompetent,\u201d Trump said.",
      "\u201cIf you take all of those millions of people off Social Security, all of a sudden we have a very powerful Social Security with people that are 80 and 70 and 90, but not 200 years old,\u201d he said. He also said that there\u2019s one person in the system listed as 360 years old.",
      "Late Monday, Musk posted a slew of posts on his social media platform X, including: \u201cMaybe Twilight is real and there are a lot of vampires collecting Social Security,\u201d and \u201cHaving tens of millions of people marked in Social Security as \u201cALIVE\u201d when they are definitely dead is a HUGE problem. Obviously. Some of these people would have been alive before America existed as a country. Think about that for a second \u2026\u201d",
      "A July 2024 report from Social Security\u2019s inspector general states that from fiscal years 2015 through 2022, the agency paid out almost $8.6 trillion in benefits, including $71.8 billion \u2014 or less than 1% \u2014 in improper payments. Most of the erroneous payments were overpayments to living people.",
      "In addition, in early January, the U.S. Treasury clawed back more than $31 million in a variety of federal payments\u2014 not just Social Security payments\u2014 that improperly went to dead people, a recovery that former Treasury official David Lebryk said was \u201cjust the tip of the iceberg.\u201d",
      "The money was reclaimed as part of a five-month pilot program after Congress gave the Department of Treasury temporary access to the Social Security Administration\u2019s \u201cFull Death Master File\u201d for three years as part of the omnibus appropriations bill in 2021. The SSA maintains the most complete federal database of individuals who have died, and the file contains more than 142 million records, which go back to 1899, according to the Treasury.",
      "Treasury estimated in January that it would recover more than $215 million during its three-year access period, which runs from December 2023 through 2026.",
      "No.",
      "Part of the confusion comes from Social Security's software system called COBOL, which has a lack of date type in its programming. This means that some entries with missing or incomplete birthdates will default to a reference point of more than 150 years ago. The news organization WIRED first reported on the use of COBOL programming language at the Social Security Administration.",
      "Additionally, a series of reports from the Social Security Administration\u2019s inspector general in March 2023 and July 2024 state that the agency has not established a new system to properly annotate death information in its database, which included roughly 18.9 million Social Security numbers of people born in 1920 or earlier but were not marked as deceased. This does not mean, however, that these individuals were receiving benefits.",
      "The agency decided not to update the database because of the cost to do so, which would run upward of $9 million.",
      "A July 2023 Social Security OIG report states that \"almost none of the numberholders discussed in the report currently receive SSA payments.\u201d And, as of September 2015, the agency automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old.",
      "Chuck Blahous, a senior research strategist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, said, \u201cTwo cheers for Elon Musk if he can root out and put a stop to improper payments.\u201d",
      "But to pick the places in the federal government where error rates are high, \u201cSocial Security would be near the bottom of the list, not near the top,\u201d Blahous said. \"Medicaid improper payment rates are quite substantial, and soared after the Medicaid expansion of the ACA.\"",
      "\u201cBy all means \u2014 go after any improper payments that are found, but let\u2019s not pretend that\u2019s where the system\u2019s biggest financial problems are,\u201d he said.",
      "Sita Nataraj Slavov, a professor of public policy at the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University, said the claims by Musk and Trump will make people think the solutions to the government's financial problems are simpler than they appear.",
      "\u201cThe real concern is that this claim may mislead people into thinking there\u2019s an easy fix to Social Security\u2019s financial problems \u2014 that we can somehow restore solvency without making sacrifices through higher taxes or lower benefits,\u201d Slavov said. \u201cThis is simply not true.\u201d",
      "Karoline Leavitt, the White House spokesperson, referred back to the Social Security's inspector general report.",
      "\u201cA previous investigation revealed the SSA paid at least $71.8 billion in improper payments,\u201d she said. \"The Social Security Administration is now working to find even more waste, fraud, and abuse in the Administration\u2019s whole-of-government effort to protect American taxpayers.\u201d",

      "The stampede of Argentines traveling abroad for their summer vacations is driven by several factors, including the recent devaluation of various foreign currencies, the convenience of nearby destinations accessible by car and the prohibitively high cost of domestic vacations, especially along the Argentine Atlantic coast.",

      "CUMBERLAND, Md. -- A Maryland court on Tuesday ordered a blogger known as Ziz who leads a cultlike group connected to six killings held without bail.",
      "The blogger, Jack LaSota, 34, of Berkeley, California, was arrested Sunday along with Michelle Zajko, 32, of Media, Pennsylvania, and Daniel Blank, 26, of Sacramento, California. They face charges including trespassing, obstructing and hindering and possession of a handgun in a vehicle.",
      "The Zizians have been tied to the killing of U.S. Border Patrol Agent David Maland near the Canadian border in January and five other killings in three states.",
      "LaSota, Zajko and Blank were arrested in Frostburg, Maryland, on Sunday afternoon.",
      "The judge in the case ordered LaSota held without bail citing concerns about her being a flight risk and a danger to public safety. Prosecutors said LaSota \u201cappears to be the leader of an extremist group known as Zizians\u201d that has been linked to killings.",
      "The three were expected to appear remotely for a bail hearing Tuesday at Allegany District Court in Cumberland, Maryland, court officials said.",
      "The Zizians have been tied to the death of a woman during an attack on a California landlord in November 2022, the landlord's subsequent slaying in January, the December 2022 deaths of Zajko's parents in Pennsylvania and a highway shootout last month in Vermont that left U.S. Border Patrol Agent David Maland and a car passenger dead.",

Zajko, who refused to put her hands behind her back and was taken to the ground, also was carrying a handgun, police said.",
      "Maland, 44, was killed in a Jan. 20 shootout following a traffic stop in Coventry, Vermont, a small town about 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the Canadian border. Felix Bauckholt, a passenger in the car, also died, and the driver, Teresa Youngblut, has pleaded not guilty to federal firearms charges.",
      "Officials have said the guns they were carrying were bought by a person of interest in the Dec. 31, 2022, deaths of Richard and Rita Zajko in Chester Heights, Pennsylvania, and that Youngblut had been in close contact with a person of interest in a homicide in Vallejo, California.",
      "Maximilian Snyder, who applied for a marriage license with Youngblut in November, is charged with the Jan. 17 stabbing death of Curtis Lind, a Vallejo landlord who had survived an earlier attack by members of the Zizian group and was set to testify against them.",
      "Officials have offered few details of the cross-country investigation, but Associated Press interviews and a review of court records and online postings tell the story of how a group of young, highly intelligent computer scientists, most of them in their 20s and 30s, met online, shared anarchist beliefs, and became increasingly violent.",
      "Their goals aren\u2019t clear, but online writings included topics such as radical veganism, gender identity and artificial intelligence.",
      "At the middle of it all is \u201cZiz,\u201d the leader of the strange group whose members are sometimes called \u201cZizians\u201d in online forums.",
      "LaSota published a dark and sometimes violent blog under the name Ziz and, in one section, described her theory that the two hemispheres of the brain could hold separate values and genders and \u201coften desire to kill each other.\u201d",
      "LaSota, who used she/her pronouns, and in her writings says she is a transgender woman, railed against perceived enemies, including so-called rationalist groups, which operate mostly online and seek to understand human cognition through reason and knowledge. Some are concerned with the potential dangers of artificial intelligence.",
      "LaSota has not responded to emails from the AP in recent weeks, and her attorney Daniel McGarrigle declined to comment on whether she is connected to any of the deaths. She\u2019s wanted for arrest in two states for missing court appearances.",
      "McGarrigle would only confirm Monday that he has represented LaSota and wouldn't confirm her arrest or any details of the latest case. Attempts to reach attorneys for Zajko and Blank were not successful.",
      "Pennsylvania state police records describe Daniel Blank as Michelle Zajko\u2019s housemate in Vermont. In January 2023, police investigating the shooting deaths of Zajko\u2019s parents detained both LaSota and Blank at a hotel where Zajko was staying. Blank was not charged. LaSota was charged with obstructing law enforcement and disorderly conduct.",

      "The head of the U.S. Postal Service, Louis DeJoy, says he intends to step down",
      "WASHINGTON -- Louis DeJoy, the head of the U.S. Postal Service, intends to step down, the federal agency said Tuesday, after a nearly five-year tenure marked by the coronavirus pandemic, surges in mail-in election ballots and efforts to stem losses through cost and service cuts.",
      "In a Monday letter, Postmaster General DeJoy asked the Postal Service Board of Governors to begin looking for his successor.",
      "\u201cAs you know, I have worked tirelessly to lead the 640,000 men and women of the Postal Service in accomplishing an extraordinary transformation,\" he wrote. \"We have served the American people through an unprecedented pandemic and through a period of high inflation and sensationalized politics.\u201d",
      "DeJoy took the helm of the postal service in the summer of 2020 during President Donald Trump's first term. He was a Republican donor who owned a logistics business before taking office and was the first postmaster general in nearly two decades who was not a career postal employee.",
      "DeJoy developed a 10-year plan to modernize operations and stem losses. He previously said that postal customers should get used to \u201cuncomfortable\u201d rate hikes as the postal service seeks to stabilize its finances and become more self-sufficient.",
      "The plan calls for making the mail delivery system more efficient and less costly by consolidating mail processing centers. Critics, including members of Congress from several states, have said the first consolidations slowed service and that further consolidations could particularly hurt rural mail delivery.",
      "DeJoy has disputed that and told a U.S. House subcommittee during a contentious September hearing that the Postal Service had embarked on long-overdue investments in \u201cratty\u201d facilities and making other changes to create \u201ca Postal Service for the future\u201d that delivered mail more quickly.",
      "DeJoy also oversaw the postal service during two presidential elections that saw spikes in mail-in ballots.",
      "Ahead of the 2020 presidential election, a federal judge limited one of the postal service's cost-cutting practices after finding it contributed to delays in mail delivery. DeJoy had restricted overtime payments for postal workers and stopped the agency's longtime practice of allowing late and extra truck deliveries in the summer of 2020. The moves reduced costs but meant some mail was left behind to be delivered the following day.",
      "DeJoy said in his letter that he was committed to being \u201cas helpful as possible in facilitating a transition.\u201d"

      "ALBANY, N.Y. -- New York's top court on Tuesday affirmed the constitutionality of an ethics watchdog created three years ago to stem public corruption, rejecting arguments from former Gov. Andrew Cuomo related to a $5 million book deal.",
      "The Commission on Ethics and Lobbying in Government had been fighting for its survival after Cuomo\u2019s lawyers persuaded lower courts that the panel was given unconstitutional enforcement powers. Cuomo contended that the law creating the agency violated the separation of powers mandated under the state constitution, since enforcing ethics laws is a power that belongs to the executive branch.",
      "The Court of Appeals sided with the commission in a 4-3 vote, reversing lower court rulings.",
      "Judge Jenny Rivera wrote in a majority opinion that the law creating the commission gives it narrow powers to avoid having top state officials regulating their own ethics.",
      "\"Trust in government is essential to democracy because its erosion leads to apathy, disaffection, and the breakdown of civic institutions,\" Rivera wrote. \u201cGiven the danger of self-regulation, the Legislature and the Governor have determined that there is an urgent need for the robust, impartial enforcement of the State\u2019s ethics and lobbying laws.\u201d",
      "The commission was formed by the Legislature and Gov. Kathy Hochul as a more independent alternative to a previous ethics panel widely criticized for being overly beholden to top government officials. It debuted in the wake of Cuomo\u2019s 2021 resignation in a sexual harassment scandal.",
      "Cuomo was fighting an attempt by the commission that could force him to forfeit $5 million he got for writing a book about his administration\u2019s efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic. State officials claim Cuomo hadn\u2019t kept a promise not to use any state resources on the book. Cuomo denies those allegations.",
      "A trial court judge sided with Cuomo in 2023, noting that enforcing ethics laws is a power that belongs to the executive branch, yet the governor cannot control ethics commission members, force them to explain their actions or remove them for neglecting their duties, the judge wrote. A mid-level appeals court upheld the judge\u2019s ruling in May.",
      "The ruling Tuesday lifts a cloud of uncertainty that has been looming over the commission for more than a year and was cheered by good government advocates.",
      "The commission\u2019s leadership released a prepared statement saying the top court's validation \u201cis especially important now, when the need for an agency with our mission is as great as it has ever been.\"",
      "Judge Michael Garcia wrote in a dissent that the law forming the commission violated constitutional \u201cbedrock principles\u201d requiring a separation of powers. He accused the majority of focusing on the individual powers granted to the commission under the statute and pronouncing \u201ceach, in turn, not wolf. But step back \u2014 it\u2019s not grandma; it\u2019s a wolf.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe intend to file for reconsideration \u2014 as is our right,\u201d Cuomo spokesperson Richard Azzopardi wrote in an email, \u201cbut it is disturbing that any judge of NY\u2019s highest court would countenance flagrant violations of the constitution when it conflicts with what is most convenient to the political class.\u201d",
      "Cuomo resigned in August 2021 after the attorney general released the results of an investigation that concluded he had sexually harassed at least 11 women. Cuomo has denied those allegations."

      "Two months of recalculating has made little difference in a list of Georgia\u2019s lowest performing schools",
      "ATLANTA -- Two months of recalculating made little difference in a list of Georgia's lowest performing schools, meaning more than 400,000 students will have a chance to apply for $6,500 vouchers to pay for private school tuition or home-schooling expenses.",
      "The Governor's Office of Student Achievement released the new list on Friday, after releasing and then removing two previous lists in December. The new list made only a handful of additions and deletions.",
      "Students zoned for the lowest performing 25% of schools under Georgia\u2019s academic rating system are eligible to apply for what the law calls \u201cpromise scholarships.\u201d",
      "The Georgia Education Savings Authority, a body created by the law, interpreted the measure to say any students in such a school\u2019s attendance zone are eligible, even if they don\u2019t attend that school. For example, if a middle school is on the list, elementary and high school students who live in that zone can also apply.",
      "An Associated Press analysis finds every student in 65 of Georgia's 180 traditional school districts are eligible to apply, including every student in Augusta's Richmond County and in Macon\u2019s Bibb County districts. Most of the districts where all students are eligible are small and rural, though.",
      "A majority of students in the DeKalb County, Clayton County and Atlanta districts will also be able to apply, the AP finds.",
      "The list was released just before the first application period of March 1 to April 15. The authority plans additional application periods during June and September. However, application deadlines for many private schools for the 2025-2026 academic year have already passed. Students could be admitted if they applied before they were certain of eligibility, or if schools allow late applications.",
      "The law capped spending at 1% of the funding formula for public schools, or $141 million. That could provide more than 22,000 vouchers. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp recommended spending that much, but lawmakers haven't yet decided on the amount.",
      "The law requires that Georgia fully fund its public schools before any money is allotted to vouchers. The money for vouchers is appropriated separately, on top of public school funding.",
      "Georgia has 1.75 million public school students. Broad eligibility means applications could far exceed the spending limit, creating pressure to raise it. Already, Republican Lt. Gov. Burt Jones has endorsed a proposal to make all foster children eligible.",
      "Voucher programs are ballooning nationwide. Many supporters want all students to be eligible, regardless of school performance or family income. States that have adopted such universal vouchers, such as Arizona, Florida, Iowa and Ohio, reported more applications than expected, causing costs to bulge.",
      "Georgia's law is more limited. Only children zoned for a low-performing school who have been enrolled for two semesters or who are incoming kindergartners can apply. If more students apply than there are vouchers available, students from households with incomes of less than four times the federal poverty level are prioritized. That's about $100,000 for a family of three. If there are still too many applications, a random statewide drawing decides who gets the money.",
      "The money can be spent on private school tuition, textbooks, transportation, home-schooling supplies, therapy, tutoring or early college courses for high school students.",
      "The House approved the program with no votes to spare this spring after seven rural Republicans and a Democrat flipped under pressure from Gov. Brian Kemp, House Speaker Jon Burns of Newington and other Republicans.",
      "The list had to be reworked twice after officials determined they would exclude some schools, including charter schools and alternative schools.",

      "The day of the crash there was light snow and fog, with a temperature of 17 degrees (minus 8.3 Celsius).",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump&rsquo;s immigration policies already are affecting schools across the country",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies already are affecting schools across the country",
      "In Fresno, California, social media rumors about impending immigration raids at the city's schools left some parents panicking \u2014 even though the raids were all hoaxes. In Denver, a real immigration raid at an apartment complex led to scores of students staying home from school, according to a lawsuit. And in Alice, Texas, a school official incorrectly told parents that Border Patrol agents might board school buses to check immigration papers.",
      "President Donald Trump's immigration policies already are affecting schools across the country, as officials find themselves responding to rising anxiety among parents and their children, including those who are here legally. Trump's executive actions vastly expanded who is eligible for deportation and lifted a ban on immigration enforcement in schools.",
      "While many public and school officials have been working to encourage immigrants to send their children to school, some have done the opposite. Meanwhile, Republicans in Oklahoma and Tennessee have put forward proposals that would make it difficult \u2014 or even impossible \u2014 for children in the country illegally and U.S.-born children of parents without documentation to attend school at all.",
      "As they weigh the risks, many families have struggled with separating facts from rumor.",
      "In the Alice Independent School District in Texas, school officials told parents that the district \u201creceived information\u201d that U.S. Border Patrol agents could ask students about their citizenship status during field trips on school buses that pass through checkpoints about 60 miles from the Texas-Mexico border. The information ended up being false.",
      "Angelib Hernandez of Aurora, Colorado, began keeping her children home from their schools a few days a week after Trump\u2019s inauguration. Now she doesn\u2019t send them at all.",
      "She\u2019s worried immigration agents will visit her children\u2019s schools, detain them and separate her family.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve told me, \u2018Hopefully we won\u2019t ever be detained by ourselves,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThat would terrify them.\u201d",
      "Hernandez and her children arrived about a year ago and applied for asylum. She was working through the proper legal channels to remain in the U.S., but changes in immigration policies have made her status tenuous.",
      "In the past week, her fears have intensified. Now, she says, her perception is \u201ceveryone\u201d \u2014 from Spanish-language media to social media to other students and parents \u2014 is giving the impression that immigration agents plan to enter Denver-area schools. The school tells parents that kids are safe. \u201cBut we don\u2019t trust it.\u201d",
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are not known to have entered schools anywhere. But the possibility has alarmed families enough that some districts are pushing for a change in the policy allowing agents to operate in schools.",
      "Denver Public Schools last week sued the Department of Homeland Security, accusing the Trump administration of interfering with the education of young people in its care. Denver took in 43,000 migrants from the southern border last year, including children who ended up in the city\u2019s public schools. Attendance at schools where migrant kids are concentrated has fallen in recent weeks, the district said in the lawsuit, saying the immigration raid at a local apartment complex was a factor.",
      "The support Denver schools have given to students and families to help through the uncertainty involves \"tasks that distract and divert resources from DPS\u2019s core and essential educational mission,\u201d lawyers for the district said in the lawsuit.",
      "Around the country, conservatives have been questioning whether immigrants without legal status should even have the right to a public education.",
      "Oklahoma\u2019s Republican state superintendent, Ryan Walters, pushed a rule that would have required parents to show proof of citizenship \u2014 a birth certificate or passport \u2014 to enroll their children in school. The rule would have allowed parents to register their children even if they could not provide proof, but advocates say it would have strongly discouraged them from doing so. Even the state\u2019s Republican governor, Kevin Stitt, thought the rule went too far \u2014 and vetoed it.",
      "In Tennessee, Republican lawmakers have put forward a bill that would allow school districts to decide whether to admit students without papers. They say they hope to invite legal challenges, which would give them a chance to overturn a four-decade-old precedent protecting the right of every child in the country to get an education",
      "The implications of immigration policy for U.S. schools are enormous. Fwd.us, a group advocating for criminal justice and immigration reform, estimated in 2021 that 600,000 K-12 students in the U.S. lacked legal status. Nearly 4 million students \u2014 many of them born in the U.S. \u2014 have a parent living in the country illegally.",
      "Immigration raids have been shown to impact academic performance for students \u2014 even those who are native-born. In North Carolina and California, researchers have found lower attendance and a drop in enrollment among Hispanic students when local police participate in a program that deputizes them to enforce immigration law. Another study found test scores of Hispanic students dropped in schools near the sites of workplace raids.",
      "In Fresno, attendance has dropped since Trump took office by anywhere from 700 to 1,000 students a day. Officials in the central California district have received countless panicked calls from parents about rumored immigration raids \u2013 including about raids at schools, said Carlos Castillo, chief of diversity, equity and inclusion at the Fresno Unified School District. The feared school raids have all been hoaxes.",
      "\u201cIt goes beyond just the students who \u2026 have citizenship status or legal status,\u201d Castillo said. Students are afraid for their parents, relatives and friends, and they\u2019re terrified that immigration agents might raid their schools or homes, he said.",
      "A school principal recently called Castillo in tears after a family reached out to say they were too afraid to go buy groceries. The principal went shopping for the family and delivered $100 in groceries to their home \u2014 and then sat with the family and cried, Castillo said.",
      "The district has been working with families to inform them of their rights and advise them on things like liquidating assets or planning for the custody of children if the parents leave the U.S. The district has partnered with local organizations that can give legal advice to families and has held almost a dozen meetings, including some on Zoom.",

      "NEW YORK -- A former Watergate prosecutor on Monday urged a federal judge presiding over the prosecution of New York City Mayor Eric Adams to assign a special counsel to help decide how to handle the Justice Department\u2019s request to drop charges while three ex-U.S. attorneys urged a \u201csearching factual inquiry.\u201d",
      "Attorney Nathaniel Akerman told Judge Dale E. Ho in a letter filed in the case record in Manhattan federal court that he sought to intervene because nobody was representing the public\u2019s interest after three attorneys from the Justice Department in Washington made the request Friday.",
      "The one-time Watergate prosecutor urged the judge to reject the dismissal request, saying the court could look into how the Justice Department reached its decision and could require Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, who first directed prosecutors to drop the case, to appear in court and explain his position.",
      "Akerman, representing Common Cause, a nonpartisan advocacy group for U.S. elections integrity, said the judge may ultimately need to appoint an independent special prosecutor to the case.",
      "Three ex-U.S. attorneys also submitted arguments to Ho Monday, saying what was at stake was \u201cfar more than an internal prosecutorial dispute about an individual case.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe public furor that has arisen during the past week raises concerns about respect for the rule of law and the division of power between the Executive and Judicial Branches of government in our nation,\u201d wrote John S. Martin Jr., the Manhattan U.S. attorney from 1980 to 1983; Robert J. Cleary, U.S. attorney for New Jersey from 1999 to 2002; and Deirdre M. Daly, U.S. attorney for Connecticut from 2013 to 2017.",
      "They suggested Ho first learn why the Justice Department wanted the charges dismissed and whether its reasons were pretextual.",
      "If the judge decides dismissal of charges is inappropriate, he will have multiple remedies, including the power to appoint a special prosecutor or to direct federal prosecutors to make evidence, including grand jury materials, available to state and local prosecutors, they said.",
      "They also wrote that a factual inquiry might lead to other \u201cnecessary and important outcomes,\u201d including the possibility of a contempt proceeding, criminal referrals and disciplinary recommendations.",
      "\u201cIn short, depending on the circumstances, the Court could have a variety of procedural avenues available to protect the integrity of the Court and the justice system from abuse,\u201d the former prosecutors said.",
      "The ex-prosecutors also told the judge that additional public statements regarding the events of the past week have been issued or would be issued shortly by hundreds of former federal prosecutors.",
      "Adams has pleaded not guilty to charges that while in his prior role as Brooklyn borough president, he accepted over $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions and lavish travel perks from a Turkish official and business leaders seeking to buy his influence.",
      "The last week has featured after an unusual public fight between Bove, the second-in-command of the Justice Department, and two top New York federal prosecutors: interim Manhattan U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon and Hagan Scotten, an assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan who led the Adams prosecution.",
      "On Thursday, Sassoon resigned, along with five high-ranking Justice Department officials. A day later, Scotten resigned, noting that Sassoon had properly resisted a demand that the charges be dropped and the possibility they could be reinstated after this year's election.",
      "\u201cNo system of ordered liberty can allow the Government to use the carrot of dismissing charges, or the stick of threatening to bring them again, to induce an elected official to support its policy objectives,\u201d he wrote.",
      "On Monday, Adams \u2014 amid calls to resign by some Democrats \u2014 confirmed that four of his top deputies had decided to resign in the fallout from the Justice Department\u2019s push to end the corruption case against him and ensure his cooperation with Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown.",
      "In his letter to Ho, Akerman echoed Sassoon's assertion that the Justice Department had accepted a request by Adams\u2019 lawyers for a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d \u2014 his help on immigration enforcement in exchange for dropping the case. She called it a \u201cbreathtaking and dangerous precedent.\"",
      "Akerman wrote that there was \u201coverwhelming evidence from DOJ\u2019s own internal documents showing that the dismissal of the Adams indictment is not in the public interest and is part of a corrupt quid pro quo between Mayor Adams and the Trump administration.\u201d",
      "He said the internal documents show that in return for dismissal of the indictment, Adams agreed to improperly assist the Trump administration with immigration enforcement.",
      "Adams\u2019 lawyer Alex Spiro said Thursday that the allegation of a quid pro quo was a \u201ctotal lie.\u201d",
      "When he directed Sassoon to drop the charges a week ago, Bove said the mayor of America\u2019s largest city was needed to assist in Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown and the dismissal of charges could enable Adams to campaign for reelection against multiple opponents unencumbered by criminal charges."

More than a dozen additional turtles have been brought to Loggerhead Marinelife Center since the initial group, and other turtle facilities around the state have reached capacity.",

      "MADISON, Wis. -- People who lost their homes to Hurricane Helene or California wildfires could get a sizeable tax break to move to Wisconsin.",
      "Republican legislators in the Dairy State have proposed a bill that would give anyone who moves to Wisconsin from North Carolina or Los Angeles County because they were displaced by one of the disasters a $10,000 income tax credit for the 2025 tax year. People who have been convicted of felonies wouldn't be eligible.",
      "The bill's authors, state Rep. Cindi Duchow and state Sen. Dan Feyen, said in memo to their colleagues seeking co-sponsors that the tax credit could draw people to the state and help alleviate chronic workforce shortages, particularly in the health care sector. A task force that Democratic Gov. Tony Evers formed to study Wisconsin's worker shortage released a report in August showing a potential deficit of up to 19,000 registered nurses in the state by 2040 and nearly 32,000 annual openings in the health care field over the next five years.",
      "\u201cHurricane Helene created massive flooding issues in Appalachia, and the devastating wildfires affecting Los Angeles County have displaced thousands of people from their homes,\u201d the lawmakers wrote in their memo. \u201cMany have lost nearly all possessions and will need to rebuild in the wake of this tragedy. Some highly skilled workers may consider or be forced to leave North Carolina or California, so why not incentivize them to settle in Wisconsin?\u201d",
      "The bill's prospects are unclear at best.",
      "Spokespeople for Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate Republican Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu didn't immediately respond to emails inquiring about the bill's chances of getting a floor vote in either chamber.",
      "Evers' spokesperson, Britt Cudaback, also didn't immediately respond to an email asking what the governor might do with the proposal if it reaches his desk. It's unlikely he would sign it into law given the gaping rift that has developed between him and Republican legislative leaders since he first took office in in 2019.",
      "Helene caused widespread damage in parts of the southeastern U.S. in September. More than 230 people died, including at least 106 in North Carolina, according to that state's Department of Health and Human Services.",

      "Native American activist Leonard Peltier has been released from a Florida prison, weeks after then-President Joe Biden angered law enforcement officials by commuting his life sentence to home confinement in the 1975 killings of two FBI agents",
      "SUMTERVILLE, Fla. -- Native American activist Leonard Peltier was released from a Florida prison on Tuesday, weeks after then-President Joe Biden angered law enforcement officials by commuting his life sentence to home confinement in the 1975 killings of two FBI agents.",
      "Peltier, 80, left Coleman penitentiary in an SUV, according to a prison official. He didn\u2019t stop to speak with reporters or the roughly two dozen supporters who gathered outside the gates to celebrate his release.",
      "Peltier, a member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians in North Dakota, was headed back to his reservation, where family and friends will celebrate his release with him on Wednesday and where the tribe arranged a house for him to live in while serving his home confinement.",
      "Throughout his nearly half-century in prison, Peltier has maintained that he didn't murder FBI agents Jack Coler and Ronald Williams during a confrontation that day on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. Native Americans widely believe he was a political prisoner who was wrongly convicted because he fought for tribal rights as a member of the American Indian Movement.",
      "\u201cHe represents every person who\u2019s been roughed up by a cop, profiled, had their children harassed at school,\u201d said Nick Estes, a professor of American Indian Studies at the University of Minnesota and a member of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe who advocated for Peltier\u2019s release.",
      "Biden did not pardon Peltier. But his Jan. 20 commutation of Peltier's sentence to home confinement, noting Peltier had spent most of his life behind bars and was in poor health, prompted criticism from those who believe Peltier is guilty. Among them is former FBI Director Christopher Wray, who called Peltier \u201ca remorseless killer\u201d in a private letter to Biden obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "One of his attorneys, Jenipher Jones, said Peltier was looking forward to going home.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re so excited for this moment,\u201d Jones said before his release. \u201cHe is in good spirits. He has the soul of a warrior.\u201d",
      "His supporters outside the prison, including some who waved flags saying \u201cFree Leonard Peltier,\" were elated.",
      "\u201cWe never thought he would get out,\u201d said Ray St. Clair, a member of the White Earth Band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe who traveled to Florida to be there for Peltier's release. \u201cIt shows you should never give up hope. We can take this repairing the damage that was done. This is a start.\u201d",
      "Peltier was active in AIM, which formed in the 1960s and fought for Native American treaty rights and tribal self-determination.",
      "Peltier's conviction stemmed from a 1975 confrontation on the in Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota in which the two FBI agents were killed. According to the FBI, Coler and Williams were there to serve arrest warrants for robbery and assault with a dangerous weapon.",
      "Prosecutors maintained at trial that Peltier shot both agents in the head at point-blank range. Peltier acknowledged being present and firing a gun at a distance, but he said he fired in self-defense and that his shots weren't the ones that killed the agents. A woman who claimed to have seen Peltier shoot the agents later recanted her testimony, saying it had been coerced.",
      "He was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and given two consecutive life sentences.",
      "Two other AIM members, Robert Robideau and Dino Butler, were acquitted on the grounds of self-defense.",
      "Many of Peltier's supporters and even some prosecutors have questioned the fairness of his trial and the evidence presented against him. But Michael J. Clark, president of the Society of Former Special Agents of the FBI, pointed out that numerous federal judges have denied Peltier's appeals.",
      "\u201cWe strongly oppose the commutation of his sentence,\u201d Clark said, calling the decision a \u201cpoor reflection\u201d on Biden. \u201cThis was kind of sprung on everyone at the last minute. Literally in the last minute of his presidency. It\u2019s just tough.\u201d",
      "Peltier was denied parole as recently as July and was not eligible to be considered for it again until 2026.",
      "As a young child, Peltier was taken from his family and sent to a boarding school. Thousands of Indigenous children over decades faced the same fate, and were in many cases subjected to systemic physical, psychological and sexual abuse.",
      "\u201cHe hasn\u2019t really had a home since he was taken away to boarding school,\u201d said Nick Tilsen, who advocated for Peltier's release for years and is CEO of NDN Collective, an Indigenous-led advocacy group based in South Dakota. \u201cSo he is excited to be at home and paint and have grandkids running around.\u201d",

      "New York City Mayor Eric Adams will face the federal judge on Wednesday who will decide whether to dismiss corruption charges against him after lawyers explain the abrupt change in position just weeks before an April trial",
      "NEW YORK -- New York City Mayor Eric Adams will face the federal judge on Wednesday who will decide whether to grant the Justice Department's request to dismiss corruption charges against him after lawyers explain the abrupt change in position just weeks before an April trial.",
      "Judge Dale E. Ho in Manhattan scheduled an afternoon hearing in a written order Tuesday as his first response to the government\u2019s Friday request to dismiss the charges after a weeklong clash among government lawyers that led to resignations by several top prosecutors in Washington and New York who refused to seek dismissal.",
      "Ho said the parties in the case must be prepared to address the reasons for the government's dismissal request, the \u201cscope and effect of Mayor Adams's \u2018consent in writing,\u2019\u201d ... and the \u201cprocedure for resolution of the motion.\u201d",
      "At the start of his two-page order, Ho quoted from an opinion by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan that said Rule 48(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which governs the government's request, was not created to shift absolute power from the Executive to the Judicial Branch but was intended \u201cas a power to check power.\u201d",
      "The appeals court also wrote that the Executive Branch is \u201cpresumptively the best judge of whether a pending prosecution should be terminated\u201d and advised that \u201cpending prosecutions should not be judicially disturbed unless clearly contrary to manifest public interest.\u201d",
      "Ho also cited legal history noting that a judge has independent obligations once the government has involved the judiciary by obtaining an indictment or a conviction. And he quoted from one judicial opinion that said a judge must be \u201csatisfied that the reasons advanced for the proposed dismissal are substantial\u201d before approving a dismissal.",
      "The hearing will occur as a growing number of former prosecutors express concerns about the past week's events, with some calling on Ho to conduct an inquiry that could put Washington's Justice Department leadership under a spotlight.",
      "Late Monday, Justice Connection, which supports Justice Department employees, released a letter from over 900 former federal prosecutors to career federal prosecutors that said they have \u201cwatched with alarm\u201d as values \u201cfoundational to a fair and justice legal system\u201d have been tested in the past week.",
      "In the letter, the former prosecutors said they \u201csalute and admire the courage many of you have already exhibited. You have responded to ethical challenges of a type no public servant should ever be forced to confront with principle and conviction, in the finest traditions of the Department of Justice.\"",
      "The letter was released after three former U.S. attorneys from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut submitted papers to Ho suggesting that he appoint a special prosecutor if he finds the Justice Department acted improperly or that he order that all evidence be made available to state and local prosecutors.",
      "Adams has pleaded not guilty to charges that while in his prior role as Brooklyn borough president, he accepted over $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions and lavish travel perks from a Turkish official and business leaders seeking to buy his influence.",
      "The last week has featured an unusual public fight between Emil Bove, the second-in-command of the Justice Department, and two top New York federal prosecutors: interim Manhattan U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon and Hagan Scotten, an assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan who led the Adams prosecution.",
      "Bove wrote that the case had \u201cunduly restricted Mayor Adams\u2019 ability to devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, Sassoon resigned, along with five high-ranking Justice Department officials. A day later, Scotten resigned, noting that Sassoon had properly resisted a demand that the charges be dropped and the possibility they could be reinstated after this year\u2019s election.",
      "\u201cNo system of ordered liberty can allow the Government to use the carrot of dismissing charges, or the stick of threatening to bring them again, to induce an elected official to support its policy objectives,\u201d Scotten wrote.",
      "On Monday, Adams \u2014 amid calls to resign by some Democrats \u2014 confirmed that four of his top deputies had decided to resign in the fallout from the Justice Department\u2019s push to end the corruption case against him and ensure his cooperation with Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown.",

      "Arizona's governor has vetoed legislation aimed at speeding up the counting of election results in the swing state",
      "PHOENIX -- When Arizona was among the last states to finish tallying ballots cast in the 2024 general election, state Republicans dubbed it the laughingstock of the nation and reignited their push to get faster results.",
      "They fast-tracked legislation aimed at speeding up the counting of ballots by moving up the deadline for voters to drop off early ballots, but Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs on Tuesday vetoed the measure over concerns that it would make it harder for people to vote.",
      "Her office had threatened a veto earlier this month, leading to negotiations that ultimately failed to produce some compromises Hobbs sought to ensure expanded access for voters, according to her spokesperson, Christian Slater.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, any potential compromise was rejected, leading me to believe the focus of this legislation is disenfranchising voters, not delivering faster election results for Arizonans,\u201d Hobbs said in her message to lawmakers.",
      "Arizona election results tend to come in after other states in part because of the signature verification process that state law mandates for mail ballots. Voters can currently drop off their mail ballots at polling places until 7 p.m. on Election Day. In recent elections, the state has taken close to two weeks to report its results.",
      "Republican Senate President Warren Petersen was among those who called for moving up the mail ballot drop-off deadline by four days. The Arizona Association of Counties said the majority of the state's county recorders supported the bill. He called the veto a \u201chuge mistake.\u201d",
      "Petersen said the bill mirrored a system in Florida, where the overwhelming majority of votes are reported on election night, allowing for faster race calls.",

      "\"If they won\u2019t act, we will \u2014 letting Arizona voters have the final say,\u201d he said, referring to another proposal that passed the House and is headed to the Senate. That measure, like the failed legislation, would put the question of moving up the mail ballot drop-off deadline, among other election administration reforms, before voters.",
      "Arizona has been a pioneer in expanding vote by mail since the 1990s, but only in the past decade has the pace of vote counting become an issue. When Republicans dominated the state, winners of most races were apparent on election night even as election officials continued counting ballots. But statewide races are now much closer, decided in some cases by a fraction of a percentage point, delaying the time when media organizations can declare a winner and drawing national scrutiny from voters eager to know the outcome of the presidency and key congressional races.",
      "Maricopa County Recorder Justin Heap, a former GOP state legislator who questioned the administration of elections in Arizona\u2019s most populous county, called the veto shortsighted and partisan.",
      "Pinal County Recorder Dana Lewis, who supported the bill, said the proposed deadline would have enabled elections officials to collect the majority of mail ballots prior to election night, allowing them to start the signature verification process earlier.",
      "If a Friday deadline was implemented and officials were unable to verify a voter\u2019s signature, voters would have been able to vote at the polls on Election Day rather than waiting up to five days after election night for their ballot to be fixed, Lewis said.",
      "Pima County Recorder Gabriella C\u00e1zares-Kelly, a citizen of the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation, said in a committee hearing that the bill would have disproportionately impacted voters in rural and tribal communities. ___ The Associated Press\u2019 women in the workforce and state government coverage receives financial support from Pivotal Ventures.

      "MUNICH, Germany -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he directed his ministers not to sign off on a proposed agreement to give the United States access to Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals because the document was too focused on U.S. interests.",
      "The proposal, which was at the center of Zelenskyy\u2019s talks with U.S. Vice President JD Vance on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Friday, did not offer any specific security guarantees in return, according to one current and one former senior official familiar with the talks.",
      "Zelenskyy\u2019s decision to reject a deal, at least for now, was described as \u201cshort-sighted\u201d by a senior White House official.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t let the ministers sign a relevant agreement because in my view it is not ready to protect us, our interest,\u201d Zelenskyy told The Associated Press on Saturday in Munich.",
      "The proposal focused on how the U.S. could use Kyiv\u2019s rare earth minerals \u201cas compensation\u201d for support already given to Ukraine by the Biden administration and as payment for future aid, current and former senior Ukrainian officials said speaking anonymously so they could speak freely.",
      "Ukraine has vast reserves of critical minerals which are used in aerospace, defense and nuclear industries. The Trump administration has indicated it is interested in accessing them to reduce dependence on China but Zelenskyy said any exploitation would need to be tied to security guarantees for Ukraine that would deter future Russian aggression.",
      "\u201cFor me is very important the connection between some kind of security guarantees and some kind of investment,\u201d the Ukrainian president said.",
      "Zelenskyy did not go into details about why he instructed his officials not to sign the document which was given to Ukrainian officials on Wednesday by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bassent on a visit to Kyiv.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a colonial agreement and Zelenskyy cannot sign it,\u201d the former senior official said.",
      "White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes did not explicitly confirm the offer, but said in a statement that \u201cPresident Zelenskyy is being short-sighted about the excellent opportunity the Trump Administration has presented to Ukraine.\u201d The Trump administration has grown weary of sending additional U.S. aid to Ukraine and Hughes said a minerals deal would allow American taxpayers to \u201crecoup\u201d money sent to Kyiv while growing Ukraine\u2019s economy.",
      "Hughes added that the White House believes \u201cbinding economic ties with the United States will be the best guarantee against future aggression and an integral part of lasting peace.\u201d He added, \u201cThe U.S. recognizes this, the Russians recognize this, and the Ukrainians must recognize this.\u201d",
      "U.S. officials in discussions with their Ukrainian counterparts in Munich were commercially minded and largely concentrated on the specifics of exploring the minerals and how to form a possible partnership to do that with Ukraine, the senior official said.",
      "The potential value of the deposits in Ukraine has not yet been discussed, with much unexplored or close to the front line.",
      "The U.S. proposal apparently did not take into account how the deposits would be secured in the event of continuing Russian aggression. The official suggested the U.S. did not have \u201cready answers,\u201d to that question and that one of their takeaways from discussions in Munich will be how to secure any mineral extraction operation in Ukraine involving people and infrastructure.",
      "Any deal must be in accordance with Ukrainian law and acceptable to the Ukrainian people, the senior Ukrainian official said.",
      "\u201cSubsoil belongs to Ukrainians under the Constitution,\u201d Kseniiia Orynchak, founder of the National Association of Mining Industry of Ukraine previously told the AP suggesting a deal would need popular support.",
      "Zelenskyy and Vance did not discuss the details of the U.S. document during their meeting Friday at the Munich Security Conference, the senior official said. That meeting was \u201cvery good\u201d and \u201csubstantive,\u201d with Vance making it clear his and Trump\u2019s main goal was to achieve a durable, lasting peace, the senior official said.",
      "Zelenskyy told Vance that real peace requires Ukraine to be in a \u201cstrong position\u201d when starting negotiations, stressed that the U.S negotiators should come to Ukraine, and that the U.S., Ukraine and Europe must be at the negotiating table for talks with Russia.",
      "But Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump\u2019s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, all but cut Europeans out of any Ukraine-Russia talks, despite Zelenskyy\u2019s request.",
      "\u201cYou can have the Ukrainians, the Russians, and clearly the Americans at the table talking,\u201d Kellogg said at an event hosted by a Ukrainian tycoon at the Munich Security Conference. Pressed on whether that meant Europeans won\u2019t be included, he said: \u201cI\u2019m a school of realism. I think that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d",

    "summary": "The government admits that stemming price rises will be 'bumpy' as inflation hit 3% in January.",
    "story": [
      "UK inflation jumped sharply in the year to January, driven by rising food prices, air fares and an increase in private school fees.",
      "The higher-than-expected jump to 3% from 2.5% in December, means prices rose at the fastest pace for 10 months.",
      "Food staples such as meat, eggs, butter and cereals were all more expensive than a year ago and comes as many households prepare for higher energy and water bills later this year.",
      "Following the latest figures, the government warned that the road back to low inflation would be \"bumpy\", but the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats argued Labour's tax rises and spending plans had caused the latest spike.",
      "Rising food prices last month mean, on average, the cost of buying groceries is 3.3% more expensive than it was a year ago.",
      "While many staples have edged up in price, some items such as olive oil and lamb have increased markedly, by 17% and 16% respectively.",
      "The rise in inflation, which is a measure used to give a general picture of how living costs have changed over a year, comes ahead of predicted increases to energy bills in April.",
      "Water and council tax bills are also slated to rise in two months' time, which will push up the cost of living for households.",
      "The government has raised the minimum wage for all age groups from April. Benefits and the state pension will also increase.",
      "But some businesses have warned that higher pay, as well as a rise in National Insurance, will mean increased prices for customers as companies attempt to cover increased costs.",
      "\"Life is a struggle\"",
      "\"Life is a struggle,\" said Gaby Cowley. The young mum told the BBC that she could already \"barely make both ends meet\" but food prices are now \"ridiculous\" \u2013 something that keeps her up at night.",
      "\"Food shopping has almost doubled from about three years ago,\" she said. \"We spend, maybe, a minimum of \u00a390 a month now and that doesn't include \u00a320-\u00a330 topping up during the week with fruit, veg and milk.\"",
      "If there is more money going out than coming in, Ms Cowley said she will sell her baby's old clothes \"just to make a little bit of money to do things\".",
      "She hopes the rise in minimum wage will see her pay go up, although she thinks the struggle is far from over.",
      "UK wages continue to outpace inflation",
      "When will interest rates go down again?",
      "As well as food, inflation was fuelled last month by plane tickets. Air fares tend to rise into December and fall into January, but the drop was less than in previous years, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).",
      "It also said that private school fees grew by about 13% at the beginning of the year due to VAT being added from 1 January after the government removed the tax exemption.",
      "The sharper rise in inflation - it had been expected to climb to 2.8% - has also led to speculation over how the Bank of England will react in terms of interest rates.",
      "High inflation in recent years, peaking at 11.1% in October 2022, saw the bank raise interest rates, which pushed up the cost of loans, credit cards and mortgages.",
      "As price rises have eased, borrowing costs have fallen and the Bank decided to cut rates earlier this month to 4.5%.",
      "But with the rate remaining above the Bank's 2% target, some economists suggest further cuts could be made at a slower pace.",
      "Professor Jonathan Haskell, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate-setting committee, told the BBC that policymakers could \"take no signal\" from the inflation spike and carry on cutting rates gradually or view it as a \"harbinger of more to come\" and change course.",
      "Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the ONS, said because the VAT charge on private schools came into effect last month, the impact on inflation was a \"one-off\".",
      "But Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the threat of higher wage bills for supermarkets and producers meant there was \"every chance\" food price rises in January would not be the last.",
      "\"This is on top of rises in everything from water bills and council tax - which is why it has become known as Awful April,\" she said.",
      "James Murray, exchequer secretary to the Treasury, admitted that getting inflation back down to the 2% target would be \"bumpy\".",
      "\"We are in a different world than we were a few years ago under the previous government, where inflation was routinely double digits,\"  he said.",
      "\"The Bank of England has been clear that they expected inflation to be slightly higher in the first half of this year....but we're confident in our plan for change to make sure that we're kick-starting economic growth by making the reforms that are necessary to boost economic growth right across the country,\" he added.",
      "But shadow chancellor Mel Stride said Labour's \"tax hikes and inflation-busting pay rises\" were to blame for the scale of January's rise.",
      "Liberal Democrat Leader Ed Davey added: \"The chancellor's misguided policies are putting us at risk of a new era of stagflation. The economy still isn't growing, and now people are being hit in their pockets too.\"",
      "Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said January's figure would be \"uncomfortable\" for the Bank of England, but said she doubted it would prevent further rate cuts.",
      "\"The risk is that the rise in inflation proves more persistent and rates are cut more slowly than we expect, or not as far,\" she added."

      "The UK's largest water and waste company was set to run out of cash by the end of March and would have likely been placed into temporary nationalisation to keep services running.",
      "The court decision on Tuesday has given Thames breathing space to undergo a major restructuring, but the future of the company remains uncertain as it struggles with \u00a319bn worth of debt and the ruling is set to be appealed.",
      "Thames has faced heavy criticism over its performance in recent years following a series of sewage discharges and leaks.",
      "The supplier serves about a quarter of the UK's population, mostly across London and parts of southern England, and employs 8,000 people.",
      "Since the dire state of the company's finances first emerged about 18 months ago, the government has been on standby to put Thames into special administration.",
      "Regardless of what happens to the company in the future, water supplies and waste services to households will continue as normal.",
      "The water regulator, Ofwat, said Thames Water remained \"subject to our turnaround oversight regime and safeguards are in place to ensure that services to customers are protected\".",
      "Thames has said the \u00a33bn in emergency funding will give it the space needed to complete a restructuring of its debts and attract a cash injection from prospective new investors.",
      "But the proposals had to be approved by the High Court after a group of Thames Water's creditors opposed it, arguing that the 9.75% interest rate on the loan was too costly.",
      "In approving the lifeline, Mr Justice Leech ruled that the \"relevant alternative\" to the company's plan being approved was temporary nationalisation, known as a Special Administration Regime.",
      "\"After taking into account the public interest in ensuring the uninterrupted provision of vital public services, I nevertheless exercise my discretion to sanction the plan,\" he said.",
      "He also added that Ofwat and the Environment Secretary had \"not opposed the plan\".",
      "Why is Thames Water in so much trouble?",
      "How much will I have to pay for my water?",
      "How much sewage is released into lakes, rivers and the sea?",
      "The Thames Water creditors in favour of the company's plan said the judgement was a \"positive step towards efforts to deliver a highly complex operational turnaround and restructuring\" and avoided \"billions in additional costs on UK taxpayers\".",
      "However, the group of creditors opposed to the deal confirmed they would appeal against the court's decision, after the judge granted them permission to do so.",
      "The group had argued an alternative \"B plan\" would provide the company with the same funding but on better terms and said it was \"disappointed\" by the ruling.",
      "\"Having this judgement reviewed by the Court of Appeal is essential against the backdrop of predatory lending to an essential utility with a clear public interest,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "'Good money after bad'",
      "Thames Water chairman Sir Adrian Montague said the ruling marked a \"significant milestone\" for the company while chief executive Chris Weston said it put \"our business on a firmer financial footing\".",
      "However, Charlie Maynard, Liberal Democrat MP for Witney in Oxfordshire, said he would appeal against the decision.",
      "The politician, who gave a witness statement to the High Court opposing the loan, said: \"Allowing Thames Water to take on \u00a33bn more debt is not in the interests of their millions of customers\".",
      "Henry Swithinbank, policy and advocacy manager at environmental charity Surfers Against Sewage, said the cash lifeline was a \"sticking plaster that will allow Thames Water to limp along until it requires another bailout\".",
      "Thames Water's problems have been blamed on a combination of poor historical regulation, actions by shareholders, climate change and management failure.",
      "Some have argued Thames should have been allowed to collapse and be nationalised due to it being the architect of its own misfortune. Previous owners loaded the company with debt and took out big dividends.",
      "But others, including water companies, have argued that a growing population and the challenges of a changing climate mean bills need to be higher and were kept at lower levels for too long.",
      "The first \u00a31.5bn of the rescue loans to Thames Water will see the company through to the autumn.",
      "A second instalment will be used to fund the company as it appeals a decision by Ofwat over how much Thames can raise household bills by \u2013 a process which could take up to a year.",
      "The company was set to repay \u00a3200m worth of debt due in March, but following the court ruling, all its debt repayments have been extended by two years.",
      "Last week, Thames launched an appeal to allow it to increase bills by more than the regulator had granted.",
      "Ofwat has capped bill rises at 35% over the next five years, but Thames has argued they need to increase by 53%.",
      "Five other water companies - Anglian Water, Northumbrian Water, Southern Water, and Wessex Water along with water-only company South East Water - have also said they will appeal to allow them to increase bills beyond Ofwat's cap.",
      "In total, the six companies serve more than half of all households in England.",
      "David Henderson, chief executive of the trade association Water UK said the extra money is need for water infrastructure investment.",
      "Six firms have said they will not appeal: Severn Trent, United Utilities, Pennon plus Dwr Cymru Welsh Water, SES and Hafren."

    "summary": "Cornwall Insight predicts that the energy regulator will hike gas and electricity prices by 5%.",
    "story": [
      "Domestic energy prices are forecast to rise by 5% from April, adding \u00a385 a year to household bills, according to consultancy Cornwall Insight.",
      "The forecaster, which is widely regarded for its accurate predictions, said a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity would pay \u00a31,823 a year.",
      "The figures emerged as Energy Secretary Ed Miliband wrote an urgent letter to Ofgem, the regulator which sets the price cap, asking it to move quickly to protect consumers.",
      "The predicted higher prices will take effect at the same time as increases to water and council tax bills in April.",
      "However, minimum wage levels will also go up while benefits and the state pension will increase.",
      "Cornwall forecasts that the price cap will rise from its current level of \u00a31,738 per year for a typical household.",
      "Higher household bills are likely to add pressure to the government who are already facing criticism for removing the winter fuel allowance from elderly people not claiming the pension credit or other means-tested financial support.",
      "Ofgem will announce the official new energy price cap level on 25 February, which will affect homes in England, Wales and Scotland.",
      "The predicted rise will come as the days get lighter and warmer, when energy use tends to fall.",
      "Cornwall say the hike is due to a combination of colder weather and a fall in gas storage levels across Europe, which has led to a sharp rise in wholesale prices.",
      "Bills are about 50% higher than pre-Covid levels, but remain below the peak reached in 2022 when Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine caused energy prices to spike.",

      "The price cap affects 26 million households on default, variable tariffs and is set every three months by Ofgem.",
      "While the cost of each unit of gas and electricity is capped, the total bill is not, so household bills will vary depending on how much energy is used.",
      "The regulator illustrates the cap by showing the impact on the annual bill of a household with typical energy usage.",
      "In January, there was a 1.2% rise - which worked out as \u00a31.75 extra a month compared with the previous cap.",
      "A period of high prices means households have collectively built up debt of \u00a33.8bn to suppliers.",
      "The average household in arrears owes more than \u00a31,500 for electricity and \u00a31,300 for gas.",
      "A rise in the energy cap would mean a third successive increase in energy bills at a time of year when the weather starts to get warmer and households would usually hope to see a reprieve in costs.",
      "National Energy Action (NEA), a charity aimed at helping people struggling with energy bills, said it will feel like an \"interminable winter\" for many.",
      "\"There is no getting used to this new normal for the people we try to help,\" said NEA's chief executive Adam Scorer.",
      "\"Millions of the most vulnerable households are struggling with debt and severely rationing their heating.\"",

      "He suggested setting up a national retrofit advice service to \"enable people to feel confident to install measures, such as insulation and draught proofing\".",

      "OpenAI's board of directors has officially rejected Elon Musk's nearly $100bn offer for the maker of what is the world's best-known artificial intelligence (AI) tool, ChatGPT.",
      "But the unsolicited bid might not be a failure - at least as far as Musk is concerned, experts say.",
      "That's because the offer could still complicate CEO Sam Altman's plans to transform OpenAI from a non-profit controlled entity to a for-profit company.",
      "Musk is \"basically trying to stymie OpenAI's growth trajectory,\" said University of Cambridge associate teaching professor Johnnie Penn in an interview with the BBC.",
      "Profit & non-profit",
      "Last week, Musk and a consortium of investors including Hollywood superagent Ari Emanuel tabled a $97.4bn (\u00a378.4bn) offer for all of OpenAI's assets.",
      "It was a huge sum - but less than the $157bn the firm was valued at in a funding round just four months ago, and much lower than the $300bn that some think it is worth now.",
      "Complicating all of this is OpenAI's unusual structure which involves a partnership between non-profit and for-profit arms.",
      "Mr Altman is understood to want to change that, stripping it of its non-profit board.",
      "That involves costs which Mr Musk is seemingly trying to inflate.",
      "\"What Musk is trying to do here is raise the perceived value of the non-profit arm of OpenAI, so that OpenAI has to pay more to get out of the obligations it has to its own non-profit,\" said Dr Penn.",
      "The value of its non-profit assets isn't clear. With his bid, Musk was floating a price, according to Cornell University senior lecturer Lutz Finger, who is also the founder and CEO of AI startup R2Decide.",

      "\"Musk has missed the AI train, somewhat. He's behind, and he has made several attempts to catch up,\" Mr Finger said.",
      "Now, Mr Finger says, Mr Musk is trying to kneecap his most formidable competitor.",
      "An already-tense relationship appeared to worsen further last week with Mr Altman taunting Mr Musk's offer on X, and Mr Musk retorting by calling his onetime partner a \"swindler\".",
      "Mr Altman then hit back in an interview with Bloomberg, opining that Mr Musk is not \"a happy person\" and saying his decisions are made from a \"position of insecurity\".",

      "Analysts have suggested tariffs of 20% or more could be placed on the UK as well as the European Union, but the outcome remains uncertain.",
      "The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) business group warned that cars, pharmaceuticals, and food and drink were specific goods which could be \"significantly hit\" by the measures, which were announced by the White House on Thursday.",
      "The latest announcement by Trump administration was wide-ranging and threatened retaliation by the US for not just trade tariffs, but for other \"unfair or harmful acts, policies or practices\".",
      "One of the justifications Trump has given to date for imposing tariffs on countries is whether they have a trade surplus with the US - i.e. they sell more to the US than they import from the country.",

      "The president's latest announcement cited VAT as an \"unfair, discriminatory or extraterritorial tax\".",
      "VAT tax is the tax people have to pay when people buy most goods or services, apart from food and children's clothes. The standard rate in the UK is 20% and it is levied regardless of whether a product has been imported from overseas or not.",
      "George Saravelos, global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, said if the US imposed taxes based on existing tariffs and VAT combined, British businesses exporting to the US could face charges of 21%.",
      "\"If reciprocal tariffs are applied on a VAT basis, European countries would be much higher on the list of impacted countries,\" he said.",
      "William Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said the UK had a \"level of insulation\" due to it not exporting as many goods to the US in comparison to other countries.",
      "But he warned Trump's proposals would \"create more cost and uncertainty\" and \"upend established trade norms\".",

      "But he noted one of Trump's advisers had argued that given the US applied a much lower average sales tax at state level, VAT was a \"form of discriminatory tariff\".",
      "Mr Ashworth said it appeared the US president now favoured tariffs to be imposed on a \"country-by-country basis\" as opposed to his original idea of introducing universal tax on all imports to the US.",
      "'Difficult to predict'",
      "A tariff is a tax on imports collected by a government and it is paid by the company importing the good. Countries typically erect tariffs in a bid to protect certain sectors from foreign competition.",
      "But in protecting domestic businesses, prices for consumers can go up if a company importing goods from abroad passes higher costs on, rather than absorbing them or reducing imports.",
      "Caroline Ramsay, partner and head of international trade at law firm TLT, said it was \"difficult to predict\" what the latest announcement would mean for the UK.",
      "She suggested the word \"reciprocal\" did not mean what people might have first assumed, adding an assessment by the US would be made on what it considers to be fair.",
      "\"It does not mean that the USA is going to check what the UK tariff is on paper imports and match that tariff percentage for paper exports to the US from the UK,\" she added.",

      "Prof Zhao says he has also been working on adapting the technology so that the robot can see part of the way round a corner. Think of it like a hall of mirrors, he suggests, just for radio waves rather than visible light.",
      "\"It's really very interesting work and quite impressive,\" says Friedemann Reinhard at the University of Rostock in Germany, who was not involved in the work. In 2017, Prof Reinhard and colleagues described how Wi-Fi signals could allow spies to see into private rooms.",
      "One slight limitation is that the spinning array cannot, by definition, see in all directions at once. Prof Reinhard says that a lot of data processing carried out by the system appears necessary to clean up the image that results from this spinning device.",
      "However, the robot sends out radio waves in the millimetre wave band (waves that are between one and ten millimetres long). This is the same technology used for some 5G installations.",
      "\"That's potentially very attractive, it's a very well understood, cheap technology,\" says Prof Reinhard. \"I certainly would love to see a self-driving car driving only on radar.\"",
      "But it is possible to avoid using spinning radio-emitting devices to get a full picture, says Fabio da Silva, founder and chief executive of US firm Wavsens, which is also developing radio-based sensing technology.",
      "\"We created an algorithm that allows you to sense the entire space instantaneously and continuously so we don't have to spin our antennas,\" he says.",
      "He describes the system as akin to echolocation, used by bats. It sends out radio waves and \"listens\" to how the waves come back, which reveals the shape of whatever they have hit.",
      "Some researchers have used radio waves to detect concealed weapons such as hidden handguns and knives.",
      "Radio waves can even \"fingerprint\" the details of a room. Then, if scanned again later, this would reveal whether any objects in the room have been moved.",
      "Last year, scientists in Germany proposed that countries use this method to scrutinise other countries' management of their nuclear weapons stockpiles. It would be one way of knowing whether someone had been moving the warheads around, for example.",
      "Separately, Luana Olivieri at Loughborough University has explored using a different form of non-visible electromagnetic radiation, terahertz waves. These are shorter than radio waves but longer than visible light waves. \"This wavelength is particularly unexplored,\" says Dr Olivieri.",
      "It is possible to see through objects and analyse materials using this form of radiation, she adds. Such a system could even, in theory, identify specific drugs by detecting their chemical structure.",
      "But while seeing through materials could help a rescue bot find a trapped person in some future disaster, it also has other applications. Police forces and militaries have access to radio-based technology that allows them to see through doors and walls, to some extent.",
      "\"Warfighting is definitely one market that it caters to. It can be used to find and kill someone,\" says Mr da Silva. He has exhibited Wavsens' technology to the US Department of Defense and the Israeli Ministry of Defense, he says.",
      "And yet these applications are not entirely surprising, suggests Prof Reinhard, who points out that a range of emerging technologies have, in principle, made it easier to detect and attack people.",
      "\"Maybe radar sounds scary \u2013 but drones and cheap cameras are the much more dangerous thing,\" he says."

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 22:54:48 GMT",
    "summary": "Trump wants US vehicles to be more popular in Europe, but it's a difficult market for them to crack.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump is threatening to introduce big tariffs on EU car imports, unhappy that Europeans don't buy more American vehicles. But why are US cars, with the notable exception of Tesla, not more popular in Europe?",
      "Italy's ancient towns and cities, with their narrow, cobbled streets, offer an obvious explanation why, in the words of US President Donald Trump, Europeans \"don't take our cars\".",
      "Or as car industry analyst Hampus Engellau puts it: \"Try to go around Italy in a big SUV. I've done it, and it's very difficult\".",
      "Add cost to the question, and it becomes obvious why you don't see too many American pick-up trucks on European roads, observes Mike Hawes, CEO of The Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders, which represents the industry in the UK.",
      "\"We tend to have higher fuel prices than the Americans, so we prefer smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, while they generally prefer larger vehicles.\"",
      "Mr Engellau, who works for Swedish investment bank Handelsbanken Capital Markets, also highlights petrol prices being substantially cheaper in the US. \"They pay per gallon what we pay per litre,\" he says. There are 3.8 litres to one US gallon.",
      "Yet these differences have done little to deter European carmakers from gaining market share in the US. Again, in the words of Mr Trump, the US has \"millions of cars coming in - BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and many others\".",
      "In 2022, 692,334 new EU-made cars were exported to the US, worth \u20ac36bn ($37bn; \u00a330bn). While only 116,207 new US-made cars went in the opposite direction, for \u20ac5.2bn.",
      "This imbalance is caused by unfair trading rules and needs correcting, according to Mr Trump.",
      "\"Mr Trump is concerned because the terms of trade are not really equal,\" explains Mr Engellau, pointing out that the EU's 10% tariffs on cars imported from the US far exceeds the 2.5% tariffs the US \u2013 currently - charges on cars imported from the EU.",
      "These disparities have prompted Trump to say he wants to raise US tariffs on European automotive imports. He has already announced 25% import tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, two metals crucial for carmakers.",
      "Trump's move appears to have prompted EU officials to consider reducing their own tariffs in order to protect Europe's automotive industry from a potential trade war.",
      "Trump's intervention has not impressed Jim Farley, the boss of US carmaker Ford. \"So far what we've been seeing is a lot of cost and a lot of chaos,\" NBC News recently reported him as saying.",
      "In fact, the very focus on trade is perhaps misplaced, according to automotive industry veteran Andy Palmer, formerly the chief operating officer of Nissan and CEO of Aston Martin, and currently a consultant. \"If you can help it, you don't want to ship cars around the world. They're big boxes of expensive air,\" he says.",
      "The automotive industry is global, adds the SMMT's Mr Hawes, so carmakers generally want to \"manufacture close to where the customer is based\".",
      "As such, several European carmakers, most notably marques such as BMW, Mercedes and Audi, are making some of their largest cars in North America, and some of these vehicles are exported back to Europe.",
      "US carmakers have historically pursued similar strategies in Europe. General Motors owned and manufactured European marques such as Opel/Vauxhall and Saab, but it sold the former in 2017, and shut the latter back in 2009.",
      "Meanwhile, Ford offloaded Aston Martin in 2007, Jaguar and Land Rover in 2008, and Volvo in 2010.",
      "After years of losing money, Ford is currently redirecting its European business towards electric and commercial vehicles and away from small, affordable cars, such as its Focus models.",
      "Ford plans to cut 800 jobs in the UK and 2,900 jobs in Germany by 2027, which represents a 14% reduction in its 28,000-strong European workforce.",
      "Elon Musk's Tesla has a factory near Berlin in Germany, where it makes its Model Y cars for the European market, but even here there are headwinds as low-cost Chinese imports in particular see their share of Europe's market for electric cars grow.",
      "Europe is a very tough marketplace for carmakers, according to Jose Asumendi, head of European automotive research at JP Morgan, an investment bank. \"You need to have the right products, and you need to run the manufacturing plants well.\"",
      "He also points to brands having a competitive advantage in their home countries, be it BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and Audi in Germany, Peugeot, Citroen and Renault in France, or Fiat and Alfa Romeo in Italy.",
      "\"There's a natural inclination for people to buy local champions, especially in Germany, France and Italy,\" explains Mr Asumendi.",
      "He adds that while other European countries are more open to different brands, the market is crowded, with a slew of Japanese, South Korea, and, increasingly, Chinese cars.",
      "Adding to Europe's complexities for overseas carmakers are different taxation regulations, and the need to communicate in many different languages.",
      "Mr Palmer does not think \"European customers have any particular objections to American cars\", and Mr Asumendi agrees. \"I think Europeans do like American brands, but there are many other brands available in Europe, so competition is fierce,\" he says.",
      "Mr Trump's ambition is to make the US car industry stronger, by bringing more production and innovation home. But Mr Palmer insists that a car trade war with Europe will not deliver this.",
      "Not least, he says, since tariffs tend to \"insulate the beneficiaries from the free market, and this merely makes them lazy, so they stop innovating and fail to remain competitive\".",
      "\"It's not about trade,\" adds Mr Palmer. \"It's about investment and collaboration.\"",

      "A proposed law in Colombia's Congress seeks to ban the sale of merchandise that celebrates former drug lord Pablo Escobar, whose cocaine cartel has been linked to thousands of murders.",
      "One day in 1989, Gonzalo Rojas was at school in the Colombian capital of Bogota when a teacher pulled him out of class to deliver some devastating news.",
      "His father, also called Gonzalo, had died in a plane crash that morning.",

      "The blast wasn't an accident. It was a deliberate bomb attack by Pablo Escobar and his Medell\u00edn cartel.",
      "While an era defined by drug wars, bombings, kidnappings and a sky high murder rate has largely been relegated to Colombia's past, Escobar's legacy has not.",
      "The notorious criminal, who was killed by security forces in 1993, has achieved a near cult-like status around the world, immortalised in books, music and TV productions like the Netflix series Narcos.",
      "In Colombia itself, his name and face are adorned on mugs, keychains, and t-shirts in tourist shops catering mainly to curious visitors.",
      "But a proposed law in Colombia's Congress is seeking to change this.",
      "The bill wants to ban Escobar merchandise - and that of other convicted criminals  - to help put an end to the glorification of a drug boss who was central in the global cocaine trade and widely held responsible for at least 4,000 killings.",
      "\"Difficult issues that are part of the history and memory of our country cannot simply be remembered by a T-shirt, or a sticker sold on a street corner,\" says Juan Sebasti\u00e1n G\u00f3mez, Congress member and co-author of the bill.",
      "The proposed law would prohibit the selling, as well as the use and carrying of clothing and items promoting criminals, including Escobar. It would mean fines for  those who violated the rules, and a temporary suspension of businesses.",
      "Many vendors selling the goods claim a law prohibiting this merchandise would harm their livelihoods.",
      "\"This is terrible. We have a right to work, and these Pablo T-shirts especially always sell well,\" says Joana Montoya, who owns a stall stocked full of Escobar merchandise in Comuna 13, a popular tourist zone of Medell\u00edn.",
      "Medell\u00edn, Escobar's hometown, was known as \"the most dangerous city in the world\" in the late 80s and early 90s due to violence associated with drug wars and Colombia's armed conflict.",
      "Today it's been revitalised into a hub of innovation and tourism, with vendors eager to cash in on the influx of visitors wanting to take home souvenirs - some related to Escobar.",
      "\"This Escobar merchandise benefits many families here - it sustains us. It helps us pay our rent, buy food, look after our kids,\" says Ms Montaya, who supports herself and her young daughter.",
      "Ms Montoya says at least 15% of her sales come from Escobar products, but some sellers tell the BBC that for them it's as much as 60%.",
      "If the bill is approved there would be a defined time period for sellers to familiarise themselves with the new rules and phase out their Escobar stock.",
      "\"We'd need a transition phase so that people could stop selling these products and replace them with other ones,\" explains Congressman G\u00f3mez. He says that Colombia has more interesting things to show than drug lords, and that the association with Escobar has stigmatised the country abroad.",
      "Some of the T-shirts, sold for around \u00a35, bear a catchphrase linked to Escobar - \"silver or lead?\".  This symbolises the choice the cartel boss gave to those who posed a threat to his criminal operations: accept a bribe or be killed.",
      "Shop assistant Mar\u00eda Suarez believes that the profit gained from sales of Escobar merchandise isn't ethical.",
      "\"We need this ban. He did awful things and these souvenirs are things that shouldn't exist,\" she says, explaining that she feels uncomfortable that her boss stocks Escobar items.",
      "Escobar and his Medell\u00edn cartel at one point were believed to have controlled 80% of the cocaine entering the US. In 1987, he was named as one of the richest people in the world by Forbes magazine.",
      "He spent some of his fortune developing deprived neighbourhoods, but many people consider this as a tactic to buy loyalty from some segments of the population.",
      "Years on from his father's death, Mr Rojas remembers him as a calm and responsible man, who loved his family. For him, the bill is a defining moment.",
      "\"It's a milestone in the road about how we reflect on what is happening in terms of the commercialisation of images of Pablo Escobar in order to correct it,\" says Mr Rojas.",
      "Yet he does have criticisms about the proposals. He believes the bill doesn't focus enough on education.",
      "Mr Rojas recalls a day many years ago when he met a man wearing a green T-shirt with a silhouette of  Escobar, and the words \"Pablo, President\".",
      "\"It caused me such confusion that I wasn't able to say anything to him about it,\" he says.",
      "\"There needs to be more of an emphasis on how we deliver different messages to new generations, so that there isn't a positive image of what a cartel boss is.\"",
      "Mr Rojas has actively been involved in efforts to reshape narratives around Escobar and the drug trade. Along with some other victims, he launched narcostore.co in 2019, an online shop that appears to sell Escobar-themed items.",
      "But none of the products actually exist and when customers select an item they are shown a video testimony from a victim. Mr Rojas says the site has attracted 180 million visits from around the world.",
      "In Colombia's Congress, the bill faces four stages it needs to pass before it can become law. G\u00f3mez says he's hoping it sparks reflection both inside and outside of Congress.",
      "\"In Germany you don't sell Hitler T-shirts or swastikas. In Italy you don't sell Mussolini stickers, and you don't go to Chile and get a copy of Pinochet's ID card.",
      "\"I think the most important thing the bill can do is to generate a conversation as a country - a conversation that hasn't happened yet.\"",
      "Medell\u00edn's mayor  - who was also a presidential candidate in the 2022 elections - has publicly backed the bill, calling the merchandise \"an insult to the city, the country and the victims\".",
      "In El Poblado, an upmarket area of Medell\u00edn popular with tourists, three Americans browse a stall brimming with souvenirs. One buys a cap with Escobar's name and face printed on the front. He says he wants a memento of \"history\".",
      "But for supporters of the bill, this isn't about removing Escobar from history, it's about erasing a mythical construct of him, fostering new ways to honour the victims he killed - and acknowledging the lingering pain of victims left behind."

      "A review of a controversial school sex survey which was first requested almost three years ago is to be published in the next month, the Scottish government has said.",
      "It comes after the boss of the UK's Office of Statistics Regulation (OSR) wrote to them demanding that the long-awaited review be published within 30 days.",
      "The Scottish government's Health and Wellbeing census first hit the headlines in 2021 after asking pupils as young as 14 about their sexual experiences.",
      "The OSR wrote to the Scottish government in 2022 warning that they had \"underestimated the significance\" the survey would have for parents and calling for a review of how the questions were designed and the way it was tested.",
      "In a strongly-worded letter seen by BBC Scotland News, the director of the OSR, Ed Humpherson, has now demanded that the government publish the review within 30 days.",
      "He said it was key to providing users with important methodological information that would support transparency and trust in the Scottish government.",
      "In response, the Scottish government said it would publish the review within the 30-day deadline.",
      "It also said the chief statistician for Scotland - Alastair McAlpine - would reply to Mr Humpherson's letter shortly.",
      "In the letter, the UK stats watchdog boss told Mr McAlpine that the Code of Practice for Statistics set out a requirement for his role to show \"independent decision-making and leadership\".",
      "The code says that the chief statistician should have \"sole authority\" for deciding on methods, standards and procedures of official statistics.",
      "Mr Humpherson asked Mr McAlpine to provide \"assurance on the processes and governance within the Scottish government that allow you to carry out this role effectively\".",
      "The Health and Wellbeing census was organised and promoted by the Scottish government but half of Scotland's 32 councils pulled out following concerns about a lack of informed consent and worries over the anonymity of pupils.",
      "In the end, about 130,000 pupils answered the questions online in classrooms and were told that their answers would not be shared.",
      "The questions that were asked varied for different age groups but those in S4 (ages 14 and 15) were asked about their sexual relationships and contraception.",
      "One question asks: \"People have varying degrees of sexual experience. How much, if any, sexual experience have you had?\"",
      "The multiple choice answers include \"oral sex\" and \"vaginal or anal sex\".",
      "At the time of the survey, campaigners warned that it must protect children's right to privacy and give informed consent.",
      "However, consent was done on an \"opt-out\" basis, meaning parents or pupils had to specifically refuse to take part.",
      "Parents said they were not told the nature of the questions in advance and were not asked to agree that their children's private information could be shared.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 11:42:10 GMT",
    "summary": "Spacey told Pearce he \"is not a victim\" after the Brutalist star spoke about his behaviour.",
    "story": [
      "Kevin Spacey has responded to fellow actor Guy Pearce's allegation that the Oscar-winner \"targeted\" him during the making of 1997 movie LA Confidential, telling the Australian to \"grow up\", adding: \"You are not a victim\".",
      "It comes after Pearce - one of the stars of the recent Bafta-winning film The Brutalist - this week expanded on his alleged experiences with the US actor having previously called him \"a handsy guy\" in 2018.",
      "Spacey - whose career was brought to a halt by a string of allegations - admitted to \"being too handsy\" and \"pushing the boundaries\", in an interview last year with Piers Morgan, while saying he'd not done anything illegal.",
      "In 2023 the actor was found not guilty of all charges of sexual assault against four men between 2001 and 2013 after a trial in London; and in 2022 a US court dismissed a sexual assault lawsuit against him.",
      "Spacey currently faces a civil trial over another allegation, which he denies, that he sexually assaulted a man in 2008.",
      "A further sexual abuse claim was lodged against him last week at the High Court, according to filings.",
      "'He targeted me, no question'",
      "Pearce told the Hollywood Reporter that the Oscar-winner \"targeted me, no question\" during the making of the 1997 crime thriller LA Confidential.",
      "\"But I did that thing that you do where you brush it off and go, 'ah, that's nothing. Ah, no, that's nothing'. And I did that for five months,\" he said.",
      "\"And, really, I was sort of scared of Kevin because he's quite an aggressive man. He's extremely charming and brilliant at what he does \u2013 really impressive etc.",
      "\"He holds a room remarkably. But I was young and susceptible, and he targeted me, no question.\"",
      "Pearce revealed he had told his wife at the time that he felt safe on set when his co-star Simon Baker was present, because Spacey allegedly focused his attentions on him instead.",
      "He said the #MeToo movement, which saw allegations made against many men in Hollywood from 2017 onwards, had been \"a really incredible wake-up call\" for him.",
      "The actor said he \"broke down and sobbed\" and \"couldn't stop\" after he saw the allegations against Spacey in the news headlines. \"I think it really dawned on me the impact that had occurred and how I sort of brushed it off and how I had either shelved it or blocked it out or whatever.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Spacey responded directly to Pearce in a video posted on X, saying: \"If I did something then that upset you, you could have reached out to me.",
      "\"We could have had that conversation, but instead, you've decided to speak to the press, who are now, of course, coming after me, because they would like to know what my response is to the things that you said.",
      "\"You really want to know what my response is? Grow up.\"",
      "Spacey claimed Pearce omitted to mention he had flown to Georgia a year after LA Confidential was made \"just to spend time with me\" while he was filming another movie, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.",
      "\"I mean, did you tell the press that too, or does that not fit into the victim narrative you have going?\" he added.",
      "\"I apologise that I didn't get the message that you don't like spending time with me. Maybe there was another reason, I don't know, but that doesn't make any sense. That you would have just been leading me on, right? But here you are now on a mission, some 28 years later, after I've been through hell and back.\"",
      "Spacey concluded his message by saying he was happy to have a \"conversation\" with Pearce \"anytime, anyplace\".",
      "\"I've got nothing to hide,\" he said. \"But Guy - you need to grow up. You are not a victim.\"",
      "Pearce earlier told the US publication he had raised Spacey's alleged behaviour with him years later, and had \"had a couple of confrontations with Kevin\" that \"got ugly\".",
      "His new strategy these days, he noted, was \"just try to be more honest about it now and call it for what it is\"."

    "summary": "The Wicked actor has received mostly positive reviews from critics for portraying Shakespeare's Richard II.",
    "story": [
      "From playing Anthony in Bridgerton to Fiyero in Wicked, Jonathan Bailey has nailed the art of portraying regal characters.",
      "The trend continues as he now takes on the role of Shakespeare's Richard II at the Bridge Theatre in London.",
      "He tells the BBC that his portrayal of the authoritarian king who ruled in the 1300s was inspired by HBO's Succession, which explores the power struggle between the children of media mogul Logan Roy.",
      "\"I channelled many Roys,\" Bailey explains, adding that Richard II \"explores inherited power in a very similar way to Succession but also expands on it and takes it to a new level\".",
      "The first of Shakespeare's history plays, Richard II sees the unlikeable and corrupt king be usurped by his cousin Henry Bolingbroke who goes on to become Henry IV.",
      "Directed by Nicholas Hytner, the modern-dress production sees Bailey as a cocaine-snorting and camp king.",
      "The 36-year-old said he chose to take on the role of Richard II as there was \"so much to explore with his character\".",
      "\"It's a feast of a play and really speaks to our times - it's fascinating to explore a king who has a cast iron right to rule.\"",
      "'Commands the stage'",
      "Bailey's performance has been positively received by most critics.",
      "The Guardian's three star review said his \"words glitter with feeling\" and added that he \"singularly shines, his luminosity putting the others slightly in the shade\".",
      "The Evening Standard's review added that Bailey \"commands the stage and even allows a little camp to seep into the character\" while the Independent said, in a four-star review, that Bailey has \"an infectious spirit of camp naughtiness, he hugs his crown like a teddy bear, aims wry put-downs at dull courtiers, and bosses his court around like they're actors in a play\".",
      "However, in a three-star review, Dominic Cavendish from the Telegraph suggestedthat Bailey \"doesn't attain the greatness of Ben Whishaw and David Tennant\".",
      "There was also praise for some of the other actors, notably Michael Simkins. The Times said his Duke of York is \"stateliness personified\", but also awarded three stars overall.",
      "The New York Times also commended Simkins: \"His finger-wagging exasperation, verging at times on slapstick, gives an audience-friendly commentary on the unfolding intrigue.\"",
      "Newer fans of Bailey may not realise that he is first and foremost a theatre actor.",
      "In 2013, he played Cassio in Hytner's Othello at the National Theatre and has also performed alongside Ian McKellen in King Lear.",
      "Productions of Shakespeare's plays rarely have a large audience of young women, but Bailey's appeal among that demographic seems to have inspired them to visit the theatre.",
      "\"It makes me so happy to inspire a new generation of young people coming to the theatre,\" he says.",
      "\"If 10 people per show come and see Shakespeare for the first time then I'm doing something right.\""

      "Rapper A$AP Rocky has been found not guilty of firing a gun at a former friend.",
      "A jury in Los Angeles acquitted the musician, whose legal name is Rakim Mayers, on two felony assault charges that carried up to 24 years in prison.",
      "Terell Ephron claimed the Grammy-nominated hip-hop star opened fire at him during an argument on a Hollywood street on 6 November 2021, grazing his knuckles with one of the shots.",
      "Mr Mayers, who is also a fashion mogul and the longtime partner of pop star Rihanna, denied the charges, arguing that the weapon was a prop gun and that his former friend, who calls himself A$AP Relli, was only after money.",
      "As the first not-guilty verdict was read on Tuesday, the court rang with screams and clapping. Mr Mayers rushed towards his family and Rihanna, who were seated behind him. He dived over a wooden barrier to embrace them.",
      "Rihanna had been a repeated presence in court during the trial, and for Tuesday's verdict, brought along their two sons, two-year-old RZA and one-year-old Riot.",
      "Mr Mayers also hugged his lawyers and appeared to have tears in his eyes as the second not-guilty verdict was read.",
      "\"Thank God for saving my life,\" Mr Mayers said aloud. He thanked members of the 12-person jury.",
      "The rapper was arrested on the two felony assault charges after a heated argument with his former friend in the heart of Hollywood.",
      "Mr Mayers and Mr Ephron have known each other since high school in New York and were part of the A$AP Mob hip-hop collective.",
      "Their friendship cooled as A$AP Rocky's career took off.",
      "Authorities said Mr Ephron met Mr Mayers on 6 November 2021, a day after the pair had a disagreement, outside a hotel about a block from the iconic Hollywood Walk of Fame.",
      "An altercation ensued.",
      "Mr Mayers was alleged to have pulled out a gun from his waistband and pointed it at Mr Ephron, telling him: \"I'll kill you right now.\"",
      "\"He looked me in my eyes and pointed the gun at me,\" Mr Ephron testified.",
      "Mr Ephron said he told the rapper to fire the weapon, but Mr Mayers started walking away. As he left, Mr Ephron followed, shouting at him.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that at this point, Mr Mayers once again pulled out the gun and fired multiple shots, with one bullet said to have grazed Mr Ephron's knuckles.",
      "Much of the trial hinged on whether the firearm in question was a harmless prop gun, as Mr Mayers's defence said, or a real weapon capable of causing harm, as Mr Ephron and prosecutors alleged.",
      "The weapon has not been recovered by authorities.",
      "Jurors were able to watch some footage of the altercation because parts were captured on surveillance video, including audio of gunfire, but no video evidence directly showed any shooting.",
      "Mr Ephron took two days before reporting the incident to authorities and brought shell casings he said he had retrieved from the scene.",
      "But police who responded to reports of a shooting in the area did not locate any shell casings. Mr Ephron, who said he returned with his girlfriend hours later, said he knew exactly where to look, but no surveillance footage corroborates his account.",
      "He was not admitted to hospital in Los Angeles and instead went for medical treatment after flying back to New York.",
      "Lawyers for Mr Mayers suggested that Mr Ephron had planted the shell casings to frame the rapper.",
      "The trial was marked by emotional and combative exchanges, particularly when Mr Ephron - the trial's star witness - took the stand.",
      "At one point, Mr Ephron called Mr Tacopina - a defence attorney for Mr Mayers - \"annoying\", which led to a reprimand from the judge.",
      "Another witness, A$AP Twelvyy, was asked by prosecutors about a photograph showing Mr Mayers's bed with the letters \"AWGE\" emblazoned on the furniture.",
      "When asked what that stood for, Mr Mayers unexpectedly interrupted the proceedings and yelled, \"Don't say!\" Twelvyy ultimately refused to elaborate.",
      "Outbursts from defendants during trials are uncommon, especially in front of a jury.",
      "However, for a criminal suspect on trial to interject and instruct a witness not to answer a prosecutor's question during cross-examination is something nearly unheard of in a court.",
      "The rapper is set to release his first solo album in nearly a decade and is scheduled to co-headline Los Angeles' Rolling Loud festival in March 2025.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 01:43:21 GMT",
    "summary": "EastEnders stars and commentators reflect on times the soap tackled social taboos over 40 years.",
    "story": [
      "Over its 40-year run, EastEnders hasn't just been plot twists, emotions and gripping \"doof doof\" cliffhangers.",
      "It's also tackled social issues head-on, its stars say.",
      "The series has \"done more to create social awareness\" on these issues \"than probably any documentary\", says actor Ross Kemp, who plays leather-jacket-wearing Grant Mitchell.",
      "Kemp, who is hosting a BBC documentary on the history of the soap, says over the last four decades EastEnders has been able to take on subjects many feel are taboo - and it continues to do so with recent storylines including topics such as spiking.",
      "\"You can introduce those things through a continuing drama, a soap like EastEnders, and inform more people than you possibly would do with a government campaign,\" he says.",
      "First gay kiss",
      "On 17 November 1987, EastEnders aired a kiss between characters Colin Russell (played by Lord Michael Cashman) and his boyfriend Barry Clark (Gary Hailes) on the side of the head.",
      "There was a \"furore\" after the kiss was broadcast, Kemp recalls, adding \"it wasn't even a kiss on the lips\".",
      "Former actor Lord Cashman speaks to Kemp about the reaction during the new documentary EastEnders: 40 Years on the Square.",
      "\"The media went berserk,\" he says. \"There were calls for 'this kind of filth to be taken off our screens'.\"",
      "Lord Cashman says \"it was a weird and dark time,\" adding \"there was rampant homophobia\".",
      "In 1988, Section 28 of the Local Government Act was introduced, which banned places like schools and libraries from \"promoting homosexuality\".",
      "Lord Cashman's character Colin went on to share the first mouth-to-mouth kiss between two gay men on a British soap with character Guido Smith (Nicholas Donovan) in 1989.",
      "However, the former actor, later an activist and politician, recalls the reaction from fans: \"There was one guy and he said: 'I used to stand behind the sofa so that my mum and dad couldn't see me looking at you and I knew I wasn't alone.' It made a difference.\"",
      "Domestic violence",
      "According to Ofcom's first review of public service television broadcasting, audiences said early evening programmes, like soaps, had an important social role in airing complex and controversial issues.",
      "One example came in the early 2000s, when the soap featured a domestic violence and coercive control storyline featuring Little Mo Slater (Kacey Ainsworth) and her brutal partner Trevor Morgan (Alex Ferns).",
      "Actor Ainsworth says members of the public would often confuse her for her character and offer sympathy to her in the street. \"People would try and sit me down in places, they'd put their arms around me,\" she says. \"They'd want to look after me.\"",
      "The actor adds she received \"hundreds\" of letters a week from victims of similar violence.",
      "Though one watchdog at the time said the show went \"too far\" for pre-watershed TV, research for a national domestic violence helpline highlighted the storyline as the most significant TV portrayal of violence in the home in 30 years.",
      "Colourism",
      "Molly Rainford, who plays Anna Knight, was introduced to the Square in 2023. She is the daughter of George Knight and Cindy Beale and is part of the first black and dual heritage family to run a pub on any UK soap.",
      "In February 2024, the soap aired scenes of Molly and her on-screen sister, Gina Knight (Francesca Henry), discussing colourism and how differently they are treated because of their different skin tones.",
      "Colourism is prejudice against people who have a darker skin tone or the preferential treatment of those who are the same race but have lighter skin.",
      "Speaking about the storyline, Rainford says: \"These are conversations that happen in every mixed-raced family's life. All of these conversations are so important and so valid, especially right now.\"",
      "Rainford says parents told her their children had \"conversations on the playground that day after seeing that\".",
      "Transgender representation",
      "In 2015, Riley Carter Millington became the first transgender man to play a recurring trans character in a British soap, with his portrayal of Kyle Slater in EastEnders.",

      "\"The Disney+ 19th-century bare-knuckle boxing series is blockbusting television in every conceivable sense.\"",
      "The Standard's Adam Bloodworth awarded it four stars, writing that the show's ingredients made for a \"fantastically entertaining stew \u2013 as well as a chaotic and gruesome one, where limbs get hacked off in the ring and bones crunch like so many cornflakes.",

      "Now that awards campaigning is in its final phase however, with voting for the Oscars closing on Monday, he should finally get some down time. \"The week leading up to the Oscars is actually pretty quiet, I'm looking forward to it.\"",
      "The Brutalist, a 3.5-hour film with an intermission, has been a relative box office success despite its intimidating duration.",
      "\"I'm not trying to teach anyone a lesson or anything,\" he says, \"but I do think it's good for the ecosystem that a film like this which is completely uncompromised - I don't like too many cooks in my kitchen - for that to have made $30m globally so far, that's exciting.",
      "\"All the things you're told not to do, when those films are proven to be commercially viable, and people want original, daring movies, it makes me feel more optimistic than usual.'\"",

      "Despite being drawn in to the drama, I wasn't initially invested in the characters.",
      "I'm of the reality TV generation and I couldn't help thinking, why would I watch a scripted drama when there are shows with ordinary people dealing with dramatic situations?",
      "It feels hard to care about Cindy and Ian Beale's fractious relationship on EastEnders when I can watch a real couple break up because one of their heads has been turned by a bombshell contestant entering the Love Island villa.",
      "Only last week, a clip from a Spanish reality TV programme showing a man having a meltdown as he watches a clip of his girlfriend cheating on him went viral.",
      "You can't convince me that watching a man run along a beach howling after learning about his partner's infidelity doesn't make for more engaging TV than a couple shouting faux insults at each other in the laundrette.",
      "Competition with high-budget dramas",
      "Not only are soaps competing with reality TV, but they also face fierce competition from dramas produced by streaming services.",
      "\"It feels like this was filmed 20 years ago,\" my boyfriend says within the first five minutes of watching Coronation Street. Shots are dimly lit, characters stand around in dated kitchens and conversations last a few minutes before flitting to another storyline entirely.",
      "There's nothing wrong with this per se as it adds an element of gritty reality to the shows, but people are now used to high-budget, high-stake dramas with cinematic visuals and star-studded casts.",
      "In just 12 episodes across three soaps there were more plots than I could count - the storylines covered everything from depression to infidelity to knife crime.",
      "In the past, these storylines would have undoubtedly influenced national conversations but for me, it felt like the issues were dealt with heavy-handedly and often felt shoehorned into plotlines.",
      "In comparison to shows such as Sex Education, Euphoria, and Top Boy which resonate with younger audiences by addressing themes like mental health, identity, and social justice in a way that feels authentic and visually compelling, the teenage angst of characters like Betsy and Max in Coronation Street feel unrealistic.",
      "I realise it's unfair to compare the big-budget streamer hits with soaps. The first season of Euphoria which consisted of just eight episodes reportedly cost $165m (\u00a3130m) to produce which is far greater than the budget of soaps.",
      "But, even up against shows such as Made in Chelsea, which likely has a similar budget, soaps still perform poorly with young audiences. Around a quarter of Made in Chelsea's audience is aged 16 to 34.",
      "Perhaps I'm being slightly unfair to the soaps. After all, I am jumping in decades after they first aired with no prior knowledge, so naturally it's harder to build a connection with the characters.",
      "But the longevity of the shows is part of the problem.",
      "I recognised Ian Beale from the meme of him crying \"I've got nothing left\" and I understand the Dingles are one of the most important families in Emmerdale - but I know nothing about their backstories.",
      "There's only so much empathy I can feel for Phil Mitchell's suicide attempt when I don't know the reason why.",
      "'I plan my week around it'",
      "While I might not have many thoughts about Phil Mitchell, some young people are massive soap enthusiasts.",
      "Natalie Altman, 25, is an EastEnders fanatic. She started watching it a year ago after seeing clips of the show on TikTok and while it was confusing at first to follow the plots, she immersed herself with learning about their backstories on social media. She says the show feels more authentic than reality TV.",
      "\"I love it so much I've planned my week around the 40th anniversary and even cancelled plans to make sure I can watch it live.\"",
      "Despite none of her friends watching the show and thinking she's a \"loser for watching it\", she says she loves the escapism it provides. \"I'm quite an anxious person so being stressed about things that aren't real is really good for me.\"",
      "Data suggests the London-based drama has more than double the number of young viewers than Emmerdale.",
      "But, in contrast to Natalie, 25-year-old Ryan says EastEnders is a \"bit too doom-and-gloom\" and prefers the other two soaps.",
      "\"They feel more like real life where there are positive and negative storylines.\"",
      "He adds that he doesn't live in a big city so it's nice to watch shows such as Emmerdale that reflect rural life and aren't London-centric.",
      "By the end of the week, I found myself quite enjoying EastEnders more than the other two soaps - which could be partly because I grew up in London and therefore felt more of an inherent connection.",
      "But overall I struggled with the lack of cathartic ending for all of them.",
      "I don't mind a series having multiple episodes but I have to know that all the storylines will eventually be resolved.",
      "With soaps, there is no ending. Storylines carry on even when you think they're over. A character reappears years later or someone's brother's cousin's daughter from five years ago starts digging up the drama again.",
      "I'm unlikely to continue watching soaps after this week but I can see the appeal of them for the people who have been watching it for some time.",
      "There's something impressive about their longevity - will Love Island be celebrating its 40th anniversary in 2055 and will I be tuning in as a pensioner to watch a 21-year-old man tell someone their behaviour is muggy? Probably not.",

      "The next season of The White Lotus is here, EastEnders turns 40, video games Avowed and Lost Records: Bloom and Rage are released, and Tate McRae\u2019s new album is also coming out.",
      "Read on for this week's biggest releases...",
      "Sam Fender is People Watching",
      "By Mark Savage, Music correspondent",
      "Sam Fender made me cry twice last week.",
      "The first time, it was with the video for his single People Watching, starring Sherlock's Andrew Scott as a man trying and failing to grapple with the loss of his mother.",
      "He followed that up with another heart-tugging video, for Remember My Name, in which Dave Johns (from I, Daniel Blake) plays an elderly man caring for his wife as her health fails. Beautifully shot and delicately told, these stories would bring a lump to anyone's throat.",
      "Death and loss loom large over Fender's new album, which is released Friday and is also called People Watching. He says it was inspired by his trips to and from a palliative care home to visit his friend and mentor, Annie Orwin, who he's described as being like \"a surrogate mother\" to him.",
      "\"She was the one that gave me the confidence to go on stage, and always used to be like 'why haven't you mentioned my name in your acceptance speech',\" he wrote on Instagram last year. \"But now an entire song (and album) connects to her. I hope that wherever she is now she's looking down saying 'about time kid'.\"",
      "If that leaves you expecting mawkish sentiment and introspective wallowing, you've not been paying attention. Fender is one of our finest songwriters, with a sharp eye for detail and a heartland rock style that turn even the bleakest observations into rousing stadium anthems.",
      "Standout tracks on his new album (which is produced by The War On Drugs' Adam Granduciel) include the chiming riffs of Nostalgia's Lie, which explores the false allure of living in the past; and Crumbling Empire, whose lyrics draw parallels between the de-industrialisation and urban decay of Detroit and Fender's hometown of North Shields.",
      "Pensive, melodic, uplifting, and heartrending \u2013 it's his best album yet.",

      "\"The kind of stories that these characters are facing are a little bit more existential and tragic. It has a little bit more of an operatic, dramatic dimension,\" he said.",
      "For me, the big question is whether the show can deliver the same punch without needy heiress Tanya McQuoid (Jennifer Coolidge).",

      "EastEnders turns 40",
      "It's a huge week for EastEnders as the soap celebrates its 40th birthday.",
      "To mark the moment, a special hour-long episode will air on Wednesday, the anniversary date itself.",

      "My colleague Colin Paterson has been speaking to some of the cast ahead of the big day, including Shane Richie, who's played Alfie Moon on and off for years.",
      "Richie said there was \"an air of anticipation and nerves\" ahead of the live episode.",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 00:00:34 GMT",
    "summary": "As clips from Spain's Temptation Island go viral, the BBC speaks to the show's executive producer.",
    "story": [
      "Reality TV gold has a new three-word definition: \"Montoya, por favor!\"",
      "If you've been anywhere near social media over the past fortnight, you'll know the raw drama setting the internet ablaze this award season hasn't come from Hollywood, but the love tragedy played out in clips posted from Spanish reality TV show Temptation Island.",
      "Contestant Jose Carlos Montoya's spiralling meltdown at watching his girlfriend Anita cheat with another man is like an uncensored Love Island on steroids.",
      "In Temptation Island, couples are taken to a tropical island, separated and sent to separate villas filled with attractive singles ready to test their loyalty. In a final twist, every move made is recorded for the other half to see.",
      "Forced to watch a graphic real-time stream of the betrayal, Montoya's emotions swell until he snaps, breaking all the show's rules.",
      "Blind to the now infamous pleas of host Sandra Barneda (\"Montoya, por favor!\"), he rampages down the beach to confront the pair, tugging at his shorts in anguish as lightning streaks across the sky.",
      "A second clip shows the resulting confrontation: Anita flips the script, calling out Montoya's own indiscretions before collapsing in tears, begging for forgiveness.",
      "\"This is cinema,\" wrote one X user, posting a clip that has now been watched on the platform a staggering 224 million times since 4 February.",
      "\"Montoya. The tension... you don't need to speak Spanish to understand, this is insane.\"",
      "Yet those behind Spain's Temptation Island see its success as more than just shock value. Executive producer Juanra Gonzalo tells me they are overjoyed by the \"completely unexpected\" global reaction, and he believes the show's appeal lies in its relatability.",
      "\"In Love Island, all the people are single. In Temptation Island, there are real couples, and they are putting their love at risk,\" he says. \"I think [audiences] know it too. These emotions and reactions cannot be faked.",
      "\"Everyone wants to know what their boyfriend or girlfriend is doing when they are not with them. We can imagine, but we don't know. Temptation Island lets the audience ask, what would I do in that situation?\"",
      "The magic ingredient to making this work is careful casting. \"Montoya and Anita were perfect - they are very emotive and expressive,\" he says.",
      "Gonzalo calls Montoya, a singer by trade with previous TV experience, a \"special man\". At 31, he told casters he'd \"never experienced love like this before\", having been with Anita \"every day for a year\".",
      "\"She's a strong woman with a lot of character,\" Gonzalo adds.",
      "The Sun's senior showbiz reporter Lottie Hulme says the programme's \"authentic emotion\" sets it apart from competitors like Love Island, Love Is Blind, Married At First Sight and Dating Naked.",
      "Seeing such unfettered and raw emotion may stand out to British and American viewers, who have become used to glossy and well-worn competitive reality formats like Love Island and semi-scripted reality shows like Made in Chelsea.",
      "\"It was refreshing and almost shocking to see something so raw, because it's something that we just don't see on the reality TV shows in Britain nowadays,\" Hulme says.",
      "\"We're at a point with reality TV culture where we're wondering 'what if' - are contestants really being their authentic self... or are they after followings and a brand deal?\"",
      "Alongside constructed storylines, the commercialised reality TV-to-influencer pipeline has made existing formats feel \"predictable\" adds Hulme.",
      "'Never allowed' on UK TV?",
      "A curious quirk of the Montoya phenomenon is that the Spanish show isn't available to watch in the UK - an irony that has only fuelled its illicit appeal on social media.",
      "A previous British version failed to take off, and production company Banijay says it does not presently plan to broadcast the Spanish version in the UK.",
      "After Montoya's meltdown caught the eye of Love Island host Maya Jama, she posted: \"They would never allow this on UK TV. For so many reasons. But it's one of the best things I've ever seen\".",
      "When asked why, she simply replied: \"people would complain\".",
      "Like Big Brother before it, Love Island has been the subject of complaints to Ofcom.",
      "A heated confrontation between 2021 Love Islanders Faye and Teddy over Teddy's behaviour in Casa Amor (a segment similar to Temptation Island's premise) sparked 25,000 Ofcom complaints.",
      "Despite the shocked reactions Gonzalo's show has provoked, he says it operates within strict boundaries, suitable for its primetime slot.",
      "\"Not everything we record is aired,\" he says. \"We are very careful - we only show a few seconds of sexual content.\"",
      "Temptation Island is just the latest in a string of particularly high-octane Spanish dating shows.",
      "Take Falso Amor (or Deep Fake Love) is another. Currently streaming on Netflix, it intensifies the premise of Temptation Island by asking couples to decide whether videos of each other are real or highly convincing AI deepfakes.",
      "So is content which British audiences find shocking viewed differently in Spain?",
      "When I raise Love Island's Zara Holland being stripped of her Miss Great Britain title after having sex on the show in 2016, Gonzalo is shocked and welcomes the internet's more light-hearted reaction to Anita's sexual scenes.",
      "\"As in other countries, things in Spain are progressing from the past - this is positive for our view of women and sexuality,\" he says, adding that no gender should face double standards.",
      "Montoya 'given the right help'",
      "In the UK, there has been heightened scrutiny and awareness of the impact reality TV can have on cast members' mental health, following the deaths of several former contestants.",
      "When I press Gonzalo on this, given the intensity of Montoya and Anita's experience, he says a team of psychologists monitor contestants before, during and after filming.",
      "Montoya received particular support after his beach escapade.",
      "\"We made sure he was not alone, that he had a safe space to process everything. It was important for us to provide him with the right help,\" he says.",
      "Looking ahead, Netflix is to relaunch a US version of the show next month.",
      "Gonzalo is up for the fight. He laughs at the internet's playful suggestion that the beach scene should win an Oscar, then adds: \"My team deserve all the awards!\""

      "Peter Kay made the news last weekend when he kicked two hecklers out of his show at the Manchester Arena.",
      "Kay defended the move afterwards, saying he'd done his \"best to address the situation and made light of it, as any comedian would, but unfortunately their interruptions continued\".",
      "One heckler was removed for loudly ordering the Bolton comic's favourite \"garlic bread\" one too many times. He went on to tell the Daily Mail he felt he'd been \"treated like a terrorist\".",
      "Another had announced \"we love you, Peter\" in the aftermath, resulting in Kay calling her Lisa Riley as she was ejected, because of her resemblance to the actress.",
      "The woman later said on TikTok that she felt \"humiliated\" and thought his reaction was a bit \"over the top\".",
      "BBC News journalist Ellen Kirwin told the BBC the \"vibe was good\" in the place before the red cards, which \"seemed unjustified\".",
      "The incidents prompted a week-long discussion about when piping up can be fun, and how it can quickly get out of hand.",
      "With this in mind, we asked an English, a Welsh and Scottish comedian for their thoughts on the subtle art of dealing with hecklers.",
      "'Most brutal heckle ever'",
      "Larry Dean, who starts his UK tour on Wednesday 19 February in Cardiff, tells the BBC he \"felt sorry for the audience, not just Peter Kay\".",
      "\"It's a really hard thing to do because no one wants to see a comic go serious, you feel like a teacher sometimes,\" he says.",
      "\"It changes the atmosphere when a heckler goes too far, but it really is about gauging do the people around me want me to keep going?\"",
      "Last year, Dean found himself the victim of what he has described as \"the most brutal heckle ever\".",
      "When discussing the topic of ghosts, he overheard a woman loudly talking to someone else in the audience and decided to ask if she was okay.",
      "\"My dad bought me these tickets because he's dying and he wanted me to have a laugh,\" came the reply.",
      "\"We're not laughing\", she added, \"so I've said to my pal we're going to leave.\"",
      "Dean recalls his shocked response.",
      "\"Obviously I'm not gonna make fun of that,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "The Glaswegian looked so discombobulated by the heckle that another audience member asked him if he was okay.",
      "\"Looking at it, perspective-wise, Chris Rock [who was slapped on stage at the Oscars by Will Smith] and Peter Kay - who have the two most famous show interruptions from the past few years - they've had it easy!",
      "\"They need to get this woman from Dundee to know what a heckle really is.\"",
      "His second-worst heckle involved a man on the front row repeating the same whispered swear word at him, so low that only he could hear it. \"I just had to ignore it,\" he says.",
      "Arenas, like the ones Kay performs in, bring in more people but they can also bring problems for stand-ups, he says.",
      "\"They're harder to play than a theatre or comedy club because the laughter goes up, it doesn't come towards the stage,\" says Dean, who has played support slots in arenas.",
      "He says it's difficult for comedians in Kay's situation to hear what audience members are actually saying, and that their interjections are also distracting for others watching in different parts of the arena.",
      "\"People say, 'he should have said this...', but usually people who say that have never been on stage before and they don't know how hard it can be thinking that quickly in the moment about what the best thing for the show is; because you just want everybody to have a good time.\"",
      "Another British comic James Acaster last year released a special entitled Hecklers Welcome, not because he particularly enjoys the experience, but to face his biggest fear and, as he told GQ, \"run towards the thing I was scared of\".",
      "Dean feels that \"nothing will ever catch people's attention more\" than watching a comedian get heckled.",
      "But, he warns, if you're going to take a pop at a professional then you have to expect something to come back your way.",
      "Heckling versus crowd work",
      "Abi Clarke, who has almost a million followers on TikTok, thinks most comedians will be on Kay's side of the argument.",
      "Crucially though, the Bristolian notes: \"There's a difference betwen heckling and crowd work.",
      "\"With crowd work a comedian is inviting it, you're asking a question, you're wanting a chat and that's very different from somebody shouting out a random thing.",
      "\"Once is fine, or twice but if the comedian stops engaging with you or says that's enough, then at that point you're ruining it.\"",
      "New comic superstar Paul Smith made his name roasting crowds as a comedy club MC/compere in Liverpool, while Jimmy Carr is also famed for inviting and actively engaging with interruptions.",
      "For Clarke, heckling comes into its own when comics are workshopping new material. If someone joins in, it can create new \"source material\" that can be used as a fresh joke at the next gig.",
      "\"I've had hecklers who have interrupted multiple times but if they're engaging, joining in with what you're saying and being positive, I don't mind that, it's quite fun.",
      "\"If they're just derailing the gig because they like the sound of their own voice, then I think you should just chuck them out!",
      "\"'Garlic bread' - there's not much you can do with that.\"",
      "'Spontaneous moments'",
      "Clarke thinks if you're going to someone's headline show that they've honed and crafted - \"they've perfected the rhythm, set-up and punchline\" - then the time to interject has passed.",
      "\"I promise you, It will be a better show if they get to perform it how it's meant to be performed.\"",
      "The other time that heckling comes in handy, she says, is for promotional purposes online, as comics don't want to give away their best written material for free, when a great bit of crowd banter will show off their skills just as well.",
      "\"The ones we will post are the wonderful one-off spontaneous moments because they'll never happen again, so they won't ruin the show.\"",
      "She's \"quite lucky so far\", she says, having had only \"two or three horrible instances\" of bad heckling, and in those cases the audience had her back.",
      "\"It's easy to win an argument against a person that no one in the room likes.\"",
      "Her new tour, Role Model, which kicks off on Thursday 17 April in Southampton, finds her keeping a humorous tally of bad behaviour, while questioning if she herself is a bad person for doing certain things.",
      "During these moments she finds other girls will supportively offer, \"no, it's fine\", which she really appreciates on a human level, but \"that's not what the joke is for!\".",
      "'Chaos and magic'",
      "Welsh comic Paul Hilleard, who won the BBC New Comedy Award last year, believes dealing with hecklers is \"part of the job\" and that Kay - a finalist in the same award in 1997 - may have \"thrown his toys out of the pram\" a bit, especially given he was playing to a room of \"people who love you\", he says.",
      "It's a bit different from some of the venues - or \"bear pits\" - that he plays as an up-and-coming comedian in Bristol, while also working as a teaching assistant.",
      "He sometimes performs in back rooms of pubs, where people don't always know that comedy is about to take place around them.",
      "\"Heckling is just part of the game, it's not fun... but it can be,\" he adds, mischievously.",
      "\"I've always been taught you've got to play the room. If it's chaotic, it doesn't matter if you've written the best 20 minutes ever, you've got to control that room of people who are intoxicated, and show them that you're funnier.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 00:01:45 GMT",
    "summary": "Archive documents show Manchester and Birmingham were considered as alternative settings for the soap.",
    "story": [
      "For 40 years, EastEnders has shown us life in a fictional community in east London - but from the iconic characters to the theme tune, could it all have been very different?",
      "In the early research stages of EastEnders, multiple cities were considered for the new soap, from Manchester to London to Birmingham, according to BBC archive documents.",
      "But one audience report recommended that a serial set in a working-class neighbourhood in London would probably have the most widespread appeal.",
      "This would also set the soap apart from other big series of the time, like Coronation Street (set in Greater Manchester), Emmerdale Farm (set in Yorkshire) and Crossroads (set in a Midlands motel).",
      "Though EastEnders creators Julia Smith and Tony Holland would eventually settle on the fictional Walford with its E20 postcode, at this point the show had a working title of East 8 - and it was to be based on a real street in the London borough of Hackney.",
      "In March 1984, Smith and Holland headed to Lanzarote for a working holiday where they created 23 character biographies, three years of storyline overviews and 20 detailed story breakdowns.",
      "Despite all their planning, however, some of the most important elements of EastEnders were last-minute accidents, including the iconic drum \"doof doofs\" in the theme tune, which have since become shorthand for the show's dramatic cliffhangers.",
      "\"In those days, if a theme tune was popular, you'd often release it as a single. So I would make longer versions of the themes to allow for that,\" says Simon May, the theme tune's composer, who would go on to write EastEnders-related singles for cast members Anita Dobson and Nick Berry.",
      "\"The longer version gets a bit more Cockney, so I asked the drummer to play something to transition into the end theme. He played those 'doof doofs' and Tony and Julia happened to be in the studio at the time.",
      "\"They said: 'We love that drum thing.'\"",
      "Another key ingredient of the early years of EastEnders also happened at the last minute: the pairing of the actors behind Angie and her bad-boy husband Den Watts, played by Leslie Grantham.",
      "After a read-through of the first six episodes, the producers thought that original Angie Watts actress Jean Fennell was not quite working in the role. Anita Dobson took on the character at the last minute.",
      "Actor and stuntman Derek Martin, who joined the soap 15 years later as Charlie Slater, explains he was also up for the role of Den.",
      "\"Leslie got it, and he was very good, he was the ladies' man, and I was more the hard man,\" the 91-year-old actor says.",
      "This pairing of Angie and Den proved popular with the public - and the Christmas Day 1986 episode that sees Den serve Angie divorce papers remains the only scripted programme to have been watched by more than 30 million people in the UK, according to Barb figures.",
      "'We might have something here'",
      "The first episode of EastEnders was broadcast on 19 February 1985, with 17 million people watching - making it the second most-watched episode on the BBC that week behind The Two Ronnies.",
      "This compared with the 18 million who watched the same week's Coronation Street.",
      "The episode started with a kick, as Den broke down a door to find the nearly dead body of Reg Cox (played by Johnnie Clayton) - and ended with a punch, as suspect number one in the attack, Nick Cotton (John Altman), put his fist through the glass of the Queen Vic doors.",
      "Though the press was quick to set up a rivalry between EastEnders and Coronation Street, the cast had their eye on another ITV soap.",
      "Actor Adam Woodyat, who played Ian Beale in that first episode, says: \"We were going out at the same time as Emmerdale Farm at 7pm. It felt like Emmerdale Farm gave us an absolute kicking in the ratings until they shifted us to half past seven.\"",
      "Newspapers of the time suggested reactions were mixed. A Sunday People poll of 600 viewers showed 56% of respondents didn't like the first episode, with complaints over \"coarse\" and \"bawdy\" dialogue.",
      "The Guardian, however, was more measured, with their critic Hugh Hebert predicting it would \"probably take a year before anyone knows whether the BBC has got it right\".",
      "The show would prove itself earlier than that. On 25 July 1985, the programme was the most-watched on the BBC that week. This coincided with the show's first blockbuster storyline that saw Michelle (played by Susan Tully) become pregnant by a mystery man, eventually revealed to be Den Watts.",
      "\"After the reveal of Den and Michelle,\" says Woodyat, \"that's when we started to realise we might have something here.\"",

    "story": [
      "It has been dubbed one of the world's rarest treasure troves of art but few people outside its host country know about it.",
      "For decades, masterpieces by the likes of Pablo Picasso, Vincent Van Gogh, Andy Warhol and Jackson Pollock have been kept in the basement of a museum in Iran's capital Tehran, shrouded in mystery.",
      "According to estimates in 2018, the collection is worth as much as $3bn.",
      "Only a small portion of the work has been exhibited since the 1979 Iranian Revolution but in recent years, the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art has been showcasing some of its most captivating pieces.",
      "The Eye to Eye exhibition at the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art, which opened in October 2024, was extended twice due to overwhelming public demand, running until January 2025.",
      "The display was widely regarded as one of the most significant exhibitions in the history of the museum, and it also became its most visited.",
      "The showcase featured more than 15 works unveiled for the first time, including a sculpture by Jean Dubuffet - marking its first-ever appearance in an Iranian exhibition.",
      "From abstract expressionism to pop art, the collection at the museum serves as a time capsule of pivotal artistic movements.",
      "Among the artwork is Warhol's portrait of Farah Pahlavi - Iran's last queen - a rare piece blending his pop art flair with Iranian cultural history.",
      "Elsewhere, Francis Bacon's work called Two Figures Lying on a Bed with Attendants shows figures appearing to spy on two naked men lying on a bed.",
      "On the opposite wall in the basement of the museum, a portrait of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran, is on display in juxtaposition.",
      "The museum was built in 1977 under the patronage of Pahlavi, the exiled widow of the last Shah of Iran who was overthrown during the revolution.",
      "Pahlavi was a passionate art advocate and her cousin, architect Kamran Diba, designed the museum.",
      "It was established to introduce modern art to Iranians and to bridge Iran closer to the international art scene.",
      "The museum soon became home to a stunning array of works by luminaries including Picasso, Warhol and Salvador Dali, alongside pieces by leading Iranian modernists, and quickly established itself as a beacon of cultural exchange and artistic ambition.",
      "But then came the 1979 revolution. Iran became an Islamic republic as the monarchy was overthrown and clerics assumed political control under Ayatollah Khomeini.",
      "Many artworks were deemed inappropriate for public display because of nudity, religious sensitivities or political implications.",
      "Pierre-Auguste Renoir's Gabrielle with Open Blouse was deemed too scandalous. And Warhol's portrait of the former queen of Iran was too political. In fact, Pahlavi's portrait was vandalised and torn apart with a knife during the revolutionary turmoil.",
      "After the revolution, many of the artworks were locked away, collecting dust in a basement that became the stuff of art world legend.",
      "It was only in the late 1990s that the museum reclaimed its cultural significance during the reformist presidency of Mohammad Khatami.",
      "Suddenly the world remembered what it had been missing. Art lovers could not believe their eyes. Van Gogh, Dali, even Monet - all in Tehran.",
      "Some pieces were loaned to major exhibitions in Europe and the United States, briefly reconnecting the collection with the global art world.",
      "Hamid Keshmirshekan, an art historian based in London, has studied the collection and calls it \"one of the rarest treasure troves of modern art outside the West\".",
      "The collection includes Henry's Moore's Reclining Figure series - an iconic piece by one of Britain's most celebrated sculptors - and Jackson Pollock's Mural on Indian Red Ground, a vibrant example of the American's painting technique pulsing with energy and emotion.",
      "Picasso's The Painter and His Model - his largest canvas from 1927 - also features, a strong example of his abstract works from the post-cubism period.",
      "And there is Van Gogh's At Eternity's Gate - one of the very rare survivals of his first printmaking campaign during which he produced six lithographs in November 1882.",
      "But for art lovers in Britain, the collection is out of reach. The UK Foreign Office advises against all travel to Iran and says British and British-Iranian dual nationals are at significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention.",
      "Having a British passport or connections to the UK can be reason enough for detention by the Iranian authorities, it says.",
      "Challenges remain for the museum which operates under a tight budget. Shifting political priorities mean that it often functions more as a cultural hub than a traditional museum.",
      "Yet it continues to be a remarkable institution - an unlikely guardian of modern art masterpieces in the heart of Tehran."

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 00:00:42 GMT",
    "summary": "More young people are presenting to audiology teams in England with difficulty processing sound.",
    "story": [
      "Whether it's the echo of beeping tills in a supermarket or the hissing of a coffee machine in your local caf\u00e9, the brain is constantly working to decode hundreds of noises each day.",
      "But, for some, those background noises can become so overwhelming that they distract them from recognising voices or alerts.",
      "This is the reality for Sophie, a 25-year-old administration assistant from London, who is used to being told she doesn't listen, zones out, or is \"a bit ditsy\".",
      "\"Even though I can hear that there are noises going on, I can't listen to where the noise is coming from. I know it's the person's voice, I just can't really compute it quick enough,\" she said.",
      "After a hearing test came back normal, Sophie met a private audiologist for further testing. She was eventually diagnosed with auditory processing disorder (APD), a neurological condition where the brain finds it difficult to understand sounds and spoken words.",
      "Her audiologist and others in England are now calling for more research into whether the condition is linked to overuse of noise-cancelling headphones.",
      "'Words sound like gibberish'",
      "Having grown up on a peaceful farm in the countryside, it wasn't until a few years ago when Sophie started university in London that she noticed a change in her hearing - specifically trouble identifying where a sound was coming from.",
      "She rarely attended her university lectures in person, instead opting to watch them online and with subtitles.",
      "\"All the words sounded like gibberish when I was in the actual lecture, and I was trying to hear,\" she said.",
      "It affected her social life too and Sophie would leave bars and restaurants early because of the \"overwhelming noise\".",
      "The cause of Sophie's APD diagnosis is unknown, but her audiologist believes the overuse of noise-cancelling headphones, which Sophie wears for up to five hours a day, could have a part to play.",
      "Other audiologists agree, saying more research is needed into the potential effects of their prolonged use.",
      "Five NHS audiology departments have told the BBC that there has been an increase in the number of young people referred to them from GPs with hearing issues - only to find their hearing is normal when tested and it is their ability to process sound that is struggling.",
      "APD is more common in neurodivergent people, those who have suffered from a brain injury or had a middle-ear infection as a child. However, more patients with APD are presenting outside of those categories, leaving audiologists to question if external factors, such as noise-cancelling headphones, are contributing.",
      "Hearing vs listening",
      "Renee Almeida, an adult audiology clinical lead at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, says it is important to hear a diversity of sounds so the brain can decide what is important to focus on.",
      "Her team has seen an increase in the amount of young people referred for hearing services in the last year. She said: \"There is a difference between hearing and listening. We can see that listening skills are suffering.\"",
      "Noise-cancelling headphones do have their benefits, particularly for long-term ear health where their soundproofing feature can prevent high frequency and loud noise from reaching and damaging the ear - even while listening to music.",
      "Lisa Barber, technology editor at Which?, said the devices had \"exploded in popularity\" in recent years. But the level of transparency can vary from model to model.",
      "\"Some simply offer passive noise cancelling, where the acoustic seal between the headphones and your ears reduces nearby noise,\" she said. Others have a transparency mode that allows you to hear partial background noise.",
      "A false reality?",
      "But Claire Benton, vice-president of the British Academy of Audiology, suggests that by blocking everyday sounds such as cars beeping, there is a possibility the brain can \"forget\" to filter out the noise.",
      "\"You have almost created this false environment by wearing those headphones of only listening to what you want to listen to. You are not having to work at it,\" she said.",
      "\"Those more complex, high-level listening skills in your brain only really finish developing towards your late teens. So, if you have only been wearing noise-cancelling headphones and been in this false world for your late teens then you are slightly delaying your ability to process speech and noise,\" Benton suggests.",
      "For those experiencing difficulties with sound processing in England, APD care in the NHS is limited.",
      "A UK-wide survey from 2024, distributed by the BAA and ENT UK, the professional body representing ear, nose and throat surgery, found that only 4% of audiologists consider themselves to be well-informed on APD.",
      "And, for those who are 16 years and over, the Royal National ENT and Eastman Hospital is the only NHS provider in England offering a full APD assessment and the waiting list is nine months long.",
      "Prof Doris-Eva Bamiou, who carries out the assessments there, says this is partially down to the time it takes to diagnose APD. \"It is a costly service because it is not just an audiogram, the test can take up to two hours and it requires additional assessments. In adults I also refer them for a cognitive assessment and in children I may also need to speak to an educational psychologist.\"",
      "Particularly after the pandemic, behaviours and engagement with visuals and audio has changed. This comes in part due to new products and technology, as well as increased anxiety in noisy environments after the lockdown.",
      "It is now common to see people walking outside wearing their noise-cancelling headphones and watching videos online with subtitles, despite perfectly hearing the sound. One YouGov survey showed that 61% of 18-24 year olds prefer to watch TV with the subtitles on.",
      "Dr Angela Alexander, audiologist and owner of APD Support, a private organisation, is among the audiologists calling for more research into the impact of noise-cancelling headphones on auditory processing, particularly in children.",
      "\"What does the future look like if we don't investigate this link? There are a lot of well-meaning parents and teachers who think the answer to children having problems with noise is to wear ear plugs or having noise-cancelling headphones on.\"",
      "Dr Amjad Mahmood, the head of audiology at Great Ormond Street Hospital supported the call for more research.",
      "He said there had been a \"significant increase in demand\" for assessments at the hospital's large APD clinic for under-16s. \"especially with difficulties noticed at school\".",

      "Study finds 18m people in the UK have hearing loss",
      "Treatment for APD can make a significant positive difference, with some patients able to make a full recovery.",
      "So-called \"word in noise\" training exercises on mobile apps have become a popular way of practising pulling speech from background noise. But training can vary and includes practice with auditory discrimination too, such as how to distinguish separate sounds in words like seventy and seventeen, and free and three.",
      "Microphones and low-gain hearing aids can also be provided to help the patient in certain situations, such as a meeting or classroom work, but adults outside the education system are not entitled to these products on the NHS.",
      "\"Right now I can hear there is a fan above my head but my brain is telling me that is not something I need to worry about,\" says Dr Alexander, describing what is called auditory scene analysis.",
      "\"It's the way we identify threats in our environment, so it makes sense to me that there would be an increase in anxiety if a person's brain no longer has those inputs helping tell them what is a concern and what is not.\"",
      "To improve this, Dr Alexander suggests reducing headphone use time and using the transparency mode which can amplify the background noise as well as wearing headphones that don't completely occlude or block the ears.",
      "Limited research",
      "Wayne Wilson, an associate professor in the school of health and rehabilitation sciences at The University of Queensland, says more research needs to be done on the possible link.",
      "However, he points out that doing controlled research with so many variables could prove tricky.",

    "summary": "Spending on the NHS has been going up for decades and is set to rise further. BBC Verify has examined some of the key numbers.",
    "story": [
      "The amount of money the UK spends on health, predominantly on the NHS, has been rising for decades.",
      "And as the UK population ages and people demand access to new medicines and treatments, there is every likelihood that the national bill will continue to grow.",
      "So how much could the NHS ultimately end up costing the nation? And is it possible to get better value for the money we collectively spend?",
      "BBC Verify has examined some of the key numbers.",
      "How much do we spend on health?",
      "Shortly after the NHS was founded, in 1949-50, total UK health spending was around \u00a317bn in today's money.",
      "By 2023\u201324 it had grown to \u00a3226bn.",
      "Health spending per person in 2022-23 was around \u00a33,300 in England and Scotland, \u00a33,600 in Wales and \u00a33,500 in Northern Ireland.",
      "In the Autumn Budget last year, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced an additional \u00a326bn a year for the English health budget by 2025-26, which will automatically increase the resources available to the devolved nations.",
      "As a share of the overall economy - or GDP - spending on health has massively increased over the past 70 years.",
      "In 1949-50, health spending was only 3.6% of GDP. In 2023-24, it had more than doubled to 8.1% of GDP, after peaking at more than 10% in the Covid pandemic.",
      "Health spending jumped in the pandemic due to the costs of vaccinations and the \"test and trace\" programme.",
      "Around 80% of total health spending is funded by the government in the UK, mainly going to the NHS. The other 20% comes through private insurance schemes or out-of-pocket costs.",
      "That means health spending as a share of total government spending has also considerably increased.",
      "In the middle of the 1950s, health accounted for around \u00a31 in every \u00a38 the government spent.",
      "Today it's roughly \u00a31 in every \u00a33.",
      "How does that compare to other countries?",
      "Despite that surge in health spending in recent decades, the UK is by no means an outlier among rich countries.",
      "In 2022, using comparable data on public health spending, the UK was spending around 9.3% of GDP.",
      "That was higher than Canada (7.9%) and Italy (6.8%) as well as the EU average, but less than Germany (10.9%) and France (10.2%).",
      "The US was the real outlier, spending 14.1% of GDP on health, largely because America has a private insurance system with few of the cost controls of other nations.",
      "And those countries have, like the UK, seen health spending rise considerably in recent decades, driven up by growing demand for new medical treatments and ageing populations.",
      "What's going to happen to NHS spending in future?",
      "Last year, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government's official forecaster, said there was every likelihood there would be continued upward pressure on UK public health spending, citing those same factors: an ageing population and more demand for new medicines and treatments.",
      "It also cites rising ill health among the population as one of the contributors to rising spending, albeit not the dominant one.",
      "The amount of health spending on an individual rises dramatically as they grow older. Average annual spending per person on those aged 45 is around \u00a32,000. For those aged 85 it is \u00a313,000 a year.",
      "The OBR projects that the proportion of the population aged 65 and over will rise from around one in five today to one in four by 2070.",
      "As people's incomes grow, research suggests they are typically willing to spend more of those incomes on healthcare, which in the UK is done mainly through the taxpayer-funded NHS.",
      "In its central forecast, the OBR projected UK public healthcare spending will rise by around 3% every year, after adjusting for inflation. This would be broadly in line with average growth over recent decades, although the rate has fluctuated under different governments.",
      "The OBR estimates this trend would add up to roughly an extra 1% of GDP going on public health spending every decade going forward.",
      "That would take public health spending from around 8% of GDP in 2024-25, up to 14.5% of GDP by 2073-74, equivalent to around \u00a3180bn in today's money.",
      "However, this would also depend on the long term growth rate of the economy. The OBR assumes public health spending will grow roughly twice as fast as the overall economy.",
      "If that path of spending transpired, it would also likely mean health spending accounting for an even larger share of total government public service spending.",
      "How do we get better value for money from health spending?",
      "Many politicians argue it's important for the NHS to deliver higher levels of productivity, in other words, to spend money more efficiently in order to keep the national bill under control.",
      "Productivity growth in the NHS has long lagged behind productivity growth in the rest of the UK economy.",
      "Last year, the OBR looked at what would happen if NHS productivity grew faster than currently expected in the coming decades.",
      "This, the OBR said, could curb the overall rise in public health spending. It might rise only to 11% of GDP by 2074, rather than to 14.5%.",
      "The recent indications of productivity growth in the NHS, however, are unclear.",
      "The latest estimates from the Office for National Statistics are that in the second half of 2024 NHS measured \"inputs\" - mainly in the form of more doctors and nurses hired - were 32% higher than they were before the pandemic in 2019.",
      "But measured \"outputs\" - things like operations completed and patients discharged - were only up by 7%.",
      "This meant that UK public sector health productivity was still around 19% lower than it was five years previously - and showing no signs of sustained growth.",
      "However, measuring productivity in the public services is far from simple and the ONS has stressed that these statistics are still only \"in development\".",
      "Other estimates from NHS England and the Institute for Fiscal Studies - the independent economic research institute - point to an improvement in productivity in hospitals in England more recently, suggesting a corner might have been turned in the delivery of health services after the shock of the pandemic.",
      "But regardless of the statistical discrepancy, most experts agree that improving productivity in the health sector in the medium and long term is an important objective. And the extent to which it is delivered will play a key part in determining how much the NHS ends up costing the nation in the coming years.",

    "summary": "Haines was a close adviser to Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson in the 1960s and 1970s.",
    "story": [
      "Joe Haines, political journalist and press secretary to former Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson in the 1960s and 1970s, has died aged 97, a Labour spokesman has confirmed.",
      "A \"lifelong Labour supporter, who was fiercely proud of his working class background\", Haines had a reputation for \"toughness and loyalty in equal measure\", the spokesman added.",
      "Tony Blair's former press secretary Alastair Campbell paid tribute to him as a \"superb tabloid writer\" with \"acute political judgement\".",
      "Haines, who died at his home in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, had been ill for some time and had lost his sight but had remained mentally sharp, Labour said in a statement.",
      "\"He spent Christmas and New Year on a cruise of the Iberian peninsula and recently held a 97th birthday party - he was born January 29 1928 - and insisted on dying at home, where he was looked after by carers.\"",
      "Haines joined Wilson's Downing Street operation in 1969 during his first term in office and went on to become part of the Labour leader's \"kitchen cabinet\" of close political advisers.",
      "He stayed by Wilson's side after Labour's surprise ejection from power in 1970 and was granted an expanded role in his second spell in office from 1974.",
      "He became an ally of Bernard, now Lord, Donoughue, who set up and ran Wilson's policy unit and would go on to become a close friend.",
      "But he had a turbulent relationship with another key Wilson aide, his political secretary Baroness Falkender, formerly Marcia Williams, whom he denounced in his later writings and blamed for Wilson's political demise in 1976.",
      "Haines hit the headlines last year aged 96, when he claimed Wilson had an affair with his deputy press secretary Janet Hewlett-Davies.",
      "There were persistent rumours that Wilson, who was married, had an affair with Baroness Falkender. He repeatedly denied the claims.",
      "However, this was the first time a romantic relationship with Ms Hewlett-Davies had ever been suggested.",
      "Lord Donoughue said Haines had told him about the affair during Wilson's premiership and the pair had kept the secret for nearly 50 years.",
      "But they decided to reveal the details to ensure the \"full story\" of Wilson's premiership was told after Ms Hewlett-Davies died in 2023.",
      "Haines grew up in what he later called the \"bug-ridden, gas-lit slum\" of pre-war Rotherhithe, south-east London.",
      "His father died when he was young and he was brought up in poverty by his mother, an upbringing he said drew him to join the Labour Party during his teenage years.",
      "His career in journalism began at the age of 14 at The Bulletin, a Glasgow-based mid-morning title, where he rose up the ranks to become its political correspondent.",
      "When it ceased publication in 1960 he became political correspondent at The Scottish Daily Mail.",
      "From there he joined new title The Sun, then a left-leaning broadsheet, in the years before it was acquired by Rupert Murdoch.",
      "It was from here that he was recruited by Wilson to work in Downing Street, becoming the then-prime minister's deputy press secretary and then press secretary in 1969, in what would be the final year of his first spell in power.",
      "\"A fast and brilliant writer with an acerbic tongue, he won a reputation for toughness and loyalty in equal measure,\" Labour said in a statement.",
      "\"After Wilson left office, Joe wrote a controversial best-seller about his time in politics, The Politics of Power. He later joined the Daily Mirror, rising to become group political editor, assistant editor and a non-executive director under Robert Maxwell, whose authorised biography he authored.",
      "\"In retirement, Joe continued to take a close interest in Labour politics, offering advice privately and publicly to the party and its leaders.\"",
      "He was pre-deceased by his wife Rene and they had no children.",
      "In a tribute on X, Alastair Campbell said: \"Joe was a huge support to me both when I was a journalist under his direction at the Mirror, and when I was in Number 10, doing for Tony Blair the job he did in two separate periods for Harold Wilson.",
      "\"He was a superb tabloid writer, and had a great mind, with acute political judgement. He could be grouchy but he had a great heart too.\"",
      "Cabinet Office Minister Nick Thomas-Symonds, who interviewed Haines for his 2022 biography of Wilson, said he had served the former prime minister with a \"fierce loyalty\".",
      "\"One of the great characters of twentieth-century Labour governments, he will be greatly missed,\" he added.",

      "MPs have warned against \"ageist stereotyping\" that characterises older people as stockpiling wealth as younger generations struggle.",

      "They criticise depictions of baby boomers - those born between 1946 and 1964 and now in their 60s and 70s - as either frail or enjoying a life of luxury at the expense of their children and grandchildren.",
      "The report also hits out at what the authors say was a failure by previous governments to address digital exclusion of older people as services, particularly around banking and health, increasingly move online.",

      "Why women and young people could hold more wealth in future",
      "Starmer wants to act tough to fix long-term problems - but is he avoiding the trickiest?",
      "The UK's population continues to get older overall, with 11 million people in England and Wales now aged over 65, and more than half a million people aged over 90.",
      "In its report, the committee said the portrayal of older people as \"wealth-hoarding 'boomers'\" was \"highly prevalent across all media in the UK\".",
      "An example might be the \"OK Boomer\" meme used to dismiss older people's opinions by suggesting they are out of touch.",
      "It also said discussion of intergenerational fairness tended to \"pit younger and older generations against each other in a perceived fight for limited resources\".",
      "The MPs pointed to a 2020 report from the Centre for Ageing Better, which looked at the portrayal of older people on television, in magazines and in advertising.",
      "They also said witnesses to their inquiry, on the rights of older people, said older people were \"frequently stereotyped as wealthy \"boomers\" living comfortable lives in homes they own while younger generations struggle on low incomes, unable to afford to enter the housing market and struggling with high rents\".",
      "The Commons committee wants to see a crackdown on these sorts of stereotypes by watchdogs including the Advertising Standards Authority and the broadcast media regulator Ofcom.",
      "On average individual wealth increases with age, peaking in the 60-to-64 age group at a level nine times as high as the 30-to-34 age group, according to the Office for National Statistics.",
      "Younger generations are also less likely to own their own home than their predecessors.",
      "However, the report pointed to evidence suggesting this ignores inequalities within generations.",
      "'Digital exclusion'",
      "Some older people are also still at high risk of \"digital exclusion\", MPs believe, because they do not have the skills to access online banking, council or GP services  - despite the government launching a digital inclusion strategy 10 years ago.",
      "Latest figures from Ofcom say nearly one-in-three people (29%) aged over 75 do not have access to the internet at home, compared to roughly one-in-16 (6%) of all adults.",
      "The Commons report concludes that existing laws against age discrimination are too weak and \"failing older people\" because they are rarely enforced, despite evidence of the harm such attitudes cause.",
      "Committee chairwoman Sarah Owen, a Labour MP for Luton North, said it was time for a review of how to shrink the UK's \"pervasively ageist culture\" and bring in enforcement with teeth.",
      "\"It is a considerable failure of government that the digital inclusion strategy has not been updated, nor progress tracked, for a decade,\" she said.",
      "\"Ultimately much more must be done to tackle ageist attitudes and discrimination across society, including in access to healthcare, local services, banking and transport.\"",
      "Owen is calling for the UK government to follow the Welsh example of establishing a commissioner for older people alongside community champions to deliver a national strategy.",

    "summary": "Lady Chief Justice Baroness Sue Carr says a question asked by Kemi Badenoch and the answer given by Sir Keir Starmer were both \"unacceptable\".",
    "story": [
      "The most senior judge in England and Wales has said she was \"deeply troubled\" by comments made by Sir Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch over a judge's ruling in an immigration case.",
      "Badenoch, the Tory party leader, had asked the prime minister about a decision to grant a Palestinian family the right to live in the UK after they originally applied through a scheme designed for Ukrainians, saying it was \"completely wrong\".",
      "Sir Keir said he agreed, adding: \"It should be Parliament that makes the rules on immigration\".",
      "But Lady Chief Justice Baroness Sue Carr said the remarks were \"unacceptable\" and conflicted with the duty of politicians to uphold the rule of law and respect the independent role of judges.",
      "A government spokesperson said Sir Keir had \"made clear that it is for Parliament to make the laws and for the government to decide policy.\"",
      "Speaking at her annual news conference, Baroness Carr also said that judges' concerns about their personal security were at an \"all-time high\" - thanks to attacks on social media driven by wider misreporting of their work.",
      "The exchange between Sir Keir and Badenoch came during Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) last week.",
      "Badenoch was critical of how an immigration judge had handled the family's application, which she said was made under a scheme designed for Ukrainians fleeing the war. The case has been widely misreported and misunderstood.",
      "Badenoch said: \"A judge has now ruled in their favour. That is not what the scheme was designed to do.",
      "\"This decision is completely wrong, and cannot be allowed to stand. Are the government planning to appeal on any points of law, and, if so, which ones?\"",
      "The full reading of the judgement reveals that the family of six - a mother and father, and their four children - had sought permission to live with a British relative who proved he was able to house and financially support them.",
      "Part of their case had been that they were political opponents of Hamas, which is banned in the UK under terrorism laws.",
      "The family, whose home in Gaza was destroyed by an air strike, have been granted anonymity.",
      "Their initial application had been incorrectly made using a form reserved to help Ukrainian families reunite. They eventually won permission to stay under entirely separate general human rights considerations. These allow families from any background to make a case to reunite if there are compelling reasons to do so outside of standard immigration schemes.",
      "This detail, including the specific risks the family say they faced, was not spelled out at PMQs, with Sir Keir saying the case had been one that had been dealt with under the Conservatives.",
      "PM pledges to close loophole that let Gazans settle in UK",
      "UK to deny citizenship to small boat refugees",
      "Net migration numbers are down - how have the rules changed?",
      "Replying to Badenoch, Sir Keir said: \"Let me be clear: I do not agree with the decision. The leader of the opposition is right that it is the wrong decision.",
      "\"She has not quite done her homework, however, because the decision in question was taken under the last government, according to their legal framework.\"",
      "He went on: \"It should be Parliament that makes the rules on immigration; it should be the government who make the policy. That is the principle. The home secretary is already looking at the legal loophole that we need to close in this particular case.\"",
      "The prime minister has not specified what the \"legal loophole\" is that he wants to close.",
      "Meanwhile, the two Upper Tribunal judges, who granted the family permission to reunite in the UK, said that their decision was not creating a Palestinian settlement scheme, but dealing with a complex and exceptional case.",
      "They had not been presented with any evidence from the government that this family's unusual case would open \"floodgates\".",
      "The UK currently has schemes for some Afghans, Ukrainians and people from Hong Kong to come to the UK, but no route for Palestinians.",
      "Reflecting on the PMQs clash, Baroness Carr said on Monday that \"both the question and the answer were unacceptable\".",
      "\"It is for the government visibly to respect and protect the independence of the judiciary,\" she said. \"Where parties, including the government, disagree with their findings, they should do so through the appellate process.\"",
      "She also said MPs, \"just like the governing body, have a duty to respect the rule of law\". Her officials had now written to the prime minister and the lord chancellor's offices.",
      "Responding to Baroness Carr's comments, Badenoch said \"politicians must be able to discuss matters of crucial public importance in Parliament\" - and that such debate \"doesn't compromise the independence of the judiciary\".",
      "\"This is not just some legal loophole that can be closed, but requires a fundamental overhaul of our flawed human rights laws,\" she said in a statement on X.",
      "A government spokesperson said: \"Where the law is not working as we think it should be, the government will take action to tighten up the rules - and that is what we are doing\".",
      "\"As a former chief prosecutor, the prime minister's respect for the judiciary, the role they play in our democracy and the rule of law is beyond question,\" the statement added.",
      "Making a wider point about concerns over the safety of judges, Baroness Carr said it was \"not acceptable for judges to be the subject of personal attacks for doing no more than their jobs\".",
      "\"Their job is to find the facts on the evidence before them and apply the law as it stands to those facts,\" she told reporters. \"If they get it wrong, the protection is a challenge on appeal. If the legislation is wrong, it is Parliament's prerogative to legislate.\"",
      "\"It is really dangerous to make any criticism of a judgment without a full understanding of the facts and the law,\" the lady chief justice said - adding that judges are \"public servants acting independently\" and that, \"frankly, judges deserve better\"."

      "The British Army has said it is ready to deploy to Ukraine if requested by the government.",
      "This week, 2,500 UK troops from the Army's high readiness force, the First Division,  have been taking part  in a large Nato exercise in Romania - on a training area just 16 miles (25km) from the border with Ukraine.",
      "Although mobile phones have been banned on the exercise, most soldiers are aware that there are now initial discussions to send troops to Ukraine itself.",
      "Brigadier Andy Watson, who is commanding the British contribution to the Nato exercise, says his brigade \"is absolutely ready\" should they receive orders to deploy to Ukraine.",
      "Earlier this week Keir Starmer said that he was ready and willing to send British troops to Ukraine to help guarantee its security, should there be a ceasefire.",
      "But so far he too is unclear as to what they might be asked to do.",
      "In terms of numbers of troops that might be needed, Brigadier Watson said \"clearly what the force package would look like would be dependent on what the prime minister and the Ministry of Defence would like\".",
      "But he said \"it's absolutely not\" something the UK could do on its own. \"I think the prime minister has been very clear that the UK would contribute to efforts, but absolutely not doing it on our own,\" says Brigadier Watson.",
      "Exercise Steadfast Dart is Nato's largest exercise this year and meant to demonstrate how quickly allies can come to the defence of an ally under attack. But while it's meant to demonstrate Nato's readiness, it also highlights its limitations too.",
      "The UK has shown it can move large numbers of troops and equipment, including more than 700 military vehicles, 1,400 miles (2,253 km) across Europe at relatively short notice as part of Nato's new Allied Reaction Force.",
      "And that it can operate alongside allies. More than 10,000 military personnel are taking part in the exercise from eight European nations.",
      "But that is just 10% of the number that most military experts believe might be required for any peacekeeping operation inside Ukraine which might require a force of more than 100,000.",
      "Some of the nations taking part, like Spain and Italy, have not even met Nato's own spending target for defence of 2% of GDP, set more than a decade ago. Many, including the UK, have experienced recent cuts in the size of their armed forces.",
      "When British forces were sent to Helmand in 2009, the British Army had more than 100,000 regular troops.",
      "Now it is at its smallest since the Napoleonic wars, at just over 70,000. Even before the cuts, the British Army was stretched sending a force of 9,000 troops.",
      "It required additional defence spending for urgent operational equipment, as well as a rolling deployment of fresh troops every six months. A regular Army of around 73,000 would now struggle to do something on a similar scale.",
      "Steadfast Dart is meant to show that Nato's European allies can respond to a crisis.",
      "Unusually, for a large Nato military exercise, US forces are not directly involved. But America remains Nato's most powerful and largest military member and its absence from any plan to guarantee Ukraine's security would leave a gaping hole.",
      "That's why Keir Starmer and his Defence Secretary John Healey are calling for the US to be involved, despite the Trump administration's insistence that there will be no US boots on the ground.",
      "Healey said on Tuesday that European nations would have to play a leading role but he added that \"it is only the US that can provide the deterrence to Putin that will prevent him attacking again\".",
      "Nato's intervention in Libya in 2011 illustrated how European nations struggled without their biggest partner.",
      "The US was supposed to take a back seat in the bombing campaign but was still heavily relied on for logistics - air-to-air refuelling - and providing intelligence and surveillance.",
      "Back at Exercise Steadfast Dart, Colonel Gordon Muir, who commands 4 Scots troops and previously fought alongside the US in Afghanistan, said \"there's a famous Highland saying - that friends are good on the day of battle\". He said there are few circumstances when you want to go it alone.",

      "But Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte now says that is not enough and is pushing for more than 3%.",
      "The Trump administration says it should be more like 5% of GDP. The UK government has still not set a date for its new spending target of 2.5%. Europe has also been slow to ramp up defence production.",

      "The water regulator, Ofwat, said Thames Water remained \"subject to our turnaround oversight regime and safeguards are in place to ensure that services to customers are protected\".",
      "Thames has said the \u00a33bn in emergency funding will give it the space needed to complete a restructuring of its debts and attract a cash injection from prospective new investors.",

      "UK Special Forces officers appear to have rejected every application from a former Afghan commando referred to them for sponsorship, despite the Afghan units having fought with the British on life-threatening missions against the Taliban.",
      "The MoD had previously denied there was a blanket policy to reject members of the units - known as the Triples - but the BBC has not been able to find any evidence that UK Special Forces (UKSF) supported any resettlement applications.",
      "Asked if UKSF had supported any applications, the MoD declined to answer the question.",
      "The Triples - so-called because their designations were CF 333 and ATF 444 - were set up, trained, and paid by UK Special Forces and supported the SAS and SBS on operations in Afghanistan. When the country fell to the Taliban in 2021, they were judged to be in grave danger of reprisal and were entitled to apply for resettlement to the UK.",
      "The rejection of their applications was controversial because it came at a time when a public inquiry in the UK was investigating allegations that British Special Forces had committed war crimes on operations in Afghanistan where the Triples were present.",
      "The inquiry has the power to compel witnesses who are in the UK, but not non-UK nationals who are overseas. If resettled, former members of the Triples could be compelled by the inquiry to provide potentially significant evidence.",
      "BBC Panorama revealed last year that UK Special Forces command had been given veto power over their resettlement applications and denied them asylum in Britain. The revelation caused a wave of anger among some former members of the SAS and others who served with the Afghan units.",

Lawyers for the MoD applied for a restriction order which temporarily prevented the BBC from reporting on the relevant parts of the proceedings, before withdrawing their application last week under challenge.",

      "The MoD began a review last year of all 2,022 resettlement applications referred to and rejected by UK Special Forces. All contained what MoD caseworkers on the resettlement scheme regarded as \"credible\" evidence of service with the Triples units.",
      "The government said at the time that the review would take 12 weeks, but more than a year later it has yet to be completed. Some rejections have already been overturned, allowing former Triples to come to the UK. But the MoD has refused to inform the Afghan commandos whether they are in scope of the review or if their rejections were upheld, unless they write to the MoD.",
      "Many are in hiding in Afghanistan, making it difficult to obtain legal representation or pro-actively contact the MoD. Dozens have reportedly been beaten, tortured, or killed by the Taliban since the group regained control of the country.",
      "\"Although decisions have been overturned, it's too late for some people,\" said a former Triples officer. \"The delays have caused a lot of problems. People have been captured by the Taliban or lost their lives,\" he said.",
      "The officer said that the Afghan commandos worked alongside British Special Forces \"like brothers\" and felt \"betrayed\" by the widespread rejections.",

      "Lawyers acting for the former member of the Triples also heavily criticised the level of disclosure in the case by the MoD, which has not handed over any documentation from within UK Special Forces or government records about the decision-making process that led to the rejections.",
      "In court filings, they criticised the \"total inadequacy\" of the MoD's disclosure, calling it an \"an obvious failure to comply with the duty of candour and to provide necessary explanation\" of the process.",
      "New evidence that emerged last week in court also showed that the MoD appeared to have rejected out of hand some applicants who served with UK Special Forces in Afghanistan after 2014 - when Britain's conventional armed forces left Helmand province - without even referring them to UK Special Forces headquarters for sponsorship.",
      "The MoD has not explained the reasoning behind the policy, which was kept secret from applicants. A spokesperson for the MoD said that after 2014 the UK's role \"evolved from combat operations to primarily training, advising and assisting CF 333, who were under the command of the Afghan Ministry of Interior\".",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 16:03:02 GMT",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump is set to impose 25% taxes on steel entering the US \"without exceptions\".",
    "story": [
      "Imposing US tariffs on UK steel would be \"negative\" for both countries, the business secretary has said.",
      "Jonathan Reynolds told the BBC the UK and US have a \"mutual interest\" in negotiating an exemption from President Donald Trump's plans for the 25% import tax, which could come into force in March.",
      "He said the UK was in a different trading position to other countries and could offer \"very specialised\" steel and aluminium exports the US needs like Navy submarine casings made in Sheffield, while tariffs would push up costs for US taxpayers.",
      "Reynolds' comments came after the government promised up to \u00a32.5bn in support for the UK steel industry.",
      "President Trump has said his tariffs would be enforced \"without exceptions or exemptions\".",
      "However, Reynolds told the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that imposing them on UK steel \"would be negative for ourselves, it would be negative for the US as well\".",
      "He said he has had \"some very constructive conversations with key people in the Trump administration recognising our relationship is different\", including the US special envoy to the UK.",
      "The minister told the programme he thought there was a basis for \"constructive engagement\" between the UK and US but \"I'm not saying it's easy\".",
      "He added: \"I appreciate they have a mandate for changing how they approach the issues of trade, but we have got a different argument, a different story to tell, to the EU or to China in relation to our trading relationships.\"",
      "The government has already said it would not retaliate immediately to the tariffs announced by Trump.",
      "UK Steel, which represents the industry, has said the tariffs would be a \"devastating blow\" that would damage the sector's \u00a3400m-a-year contribution to UK-US trade.",
      "The UK is not a big supplier of steel to the US, with the country accounting for about 10% of British steel exports.",
      "But there are concerns within the industry the tariffs might not just hinder exports to the US, but also lead to excess steel being \"dumped\" in the UK.",
      "This could occur if other countries no longer exporting to the US decide to offload steel at cheaper prices, which could potentially lead to UK steelmaking businesses being undercut.",
      "Shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said the \"uncertainty\" the steel industry faced due to US tariffs was something the government \"has been entirely silent on when instead they should be talking to the US, our closest trading partner\".",
      "On Sunday, the government launched a consultation on its Plan for Steel, which will look at ways to reverse long-term issues facing the industry - including cheap imports flooding the domestic market.",

      "Asked about the potential job losses in Scunthorpe, Reynolds accepted that there would be a \"reduction in head count\" with the introduction of new technologies, but he said more jobs could be created if demand for UK steel was increased.",
      "The government's plan will address issues that have been \"holding the industry back for too long\", the Department for Business and Trade (DBT) said, including:",

      "Griffiths said he looked forward to seeing a detailed plan, but added \"a clear part must be steps to reduce the cost of energy which is placing an intolerable strain on UK steel\".",
      "Help for the sector will be available through the National Wealth Fund, which partners the government with the private sector and local authorities to finance infrastructure and other projects.",
      "The government says this financial assistance could benefit Scotland, as well as areas of England such as Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, Rotherham and Redcar which have \"a strong history of steel production\".",

      "The Liberal Democrats have said the government urgently needs to prepare for retaliatory tariff. Deputy leader Daisy Cooper said the UK steel industry was being left \"dangerously exposed\" to the \"devastating damage\" Trump's tariffs could inflict."

    "story": [
      "Since BBC News reported on Thursday that Rachel Reeves had exaggerated her online CV and had been investigated over her use of expenses while working at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS), Labour colleagues have mounted a robust defence of the chancellor.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer said she had \"dealt with any issues that arise\" from the questions about her CV, and Health Secretary Wes Streeting told BBC Newsnight that she was doing a \"brilliant and difficult job\".",
      "But Labour figures have questioned our reporting on the expenses investigation, with one cabinet minister calling it totally inaccurate.",
      "Here we examine the key Labour responses and look at the evidence that supports our journalism.",
      "What did we reveal about Reeves's expenses?",
      "The BBC News investigation revealed that concerns were raised about Reeves's expenses while working at HBOS between 2006 and 2009.",
      "A detailed six-page whistleblowing complaint was submitted, with dozens of pages of supporting documents including emails, receipts and memos.",
      "It accused Reeves and two other managers, one of whom was her boss, of using the bank's money to \"fund a lifestyle\", with spending on events, taxis and gifts, including for each other.",
      "We have seen these documents and spoken to more than 20 people, many of whom were former colleagues.",
      "The chancellor and her expenses before she became an MP",
      "The chancellor and her expenses before she became an MP",
      "What happened to the whistleblower's complaint?",
      "The complaint led to an internal investigation by the bank's risk department.",
      "This was passed to internal audit, which reviewed the allegations and concluded that they were substantiated and there appeared to be evidence of wrongdoing by Reeves and her two colleagues, according to a senior source with direct knowledge of the investigation.",
      "What we have not been able to establish is what happened next and whether the bank ever reached a formal conclusion.",
      "How are Labour defending Reeves?",
      "Reeves has said she was not aware of an investigation or issue with her expenses and said she left the bank on good terms.",
      "She said her expenses had always been signed off in the proper way. The person who signed off her expenses, her boss, was also subject to the internal investigation.",
      "Other Labour figures have criticised BBC News's reporting on the story, with two MPs repeating similar attacks.",
      "On Friday, Science Secretary Peter Kyle told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the reporting was \"inaccurate\".",
      "Both he and Siobhain McDonagh, a Labour MP who appeared on BBC's Politics Live on Thursday, raised comments by a former HR manager, Jane Wayper - which, they said, disproved the BBC News's story.",
      "What did the HR manager say?",
      "Wayper spoke to the BBC after being given permission to do so by Reeves's team.",
      "She provided an on-the-record statement which said she \"would have been made aware of any investigation which concluded there was a case to answer\" on the basis that she \"would have been required to organise and oversee a disciplinary process\".",
      "However, the BBC has not reported that the case reached a formal conclusion, or that there was disciplinary action.",
      "Kyle incorrectly claimed that the quote had not been included in our report - but it had been in the article since it was first published on Thursday morning.",
      "He also incorrectly referred to Wayper as the head of HR at the bank.",
      "In reality she was an HR business partner working in the department where Reeves worked.",
      "What has Reeves said?",
      "On Friday, Reeves was asked about the expenses claims directly. She said: \"No-one ever raised any concerns about my expenses when I worked for Halifax Bank of Scotland.\"",
      "She said her expenses had been \"signed off in the proper way\" and \"no issues were ever raised\" during her time at the bank.",
      "Her expenses were signed off by her manager, who was also one of the three employees who were the subject of the expenses probe.",
      "Reeves left the bank in May 2009, as did her boss. The other senior manager was on sick leave in May and never returned to work at the bank.",
      "There is no suggestion any of the departures were linked to the investigation or spending issues and a spokesman for Reeves said the chancellor left the bank on good terms.",
      "What has BBC News established about her LinkedIn CV?",
      "Reeves has accepted the findings of another part of our investigation, this time over her CV.",
      "We established that the chancellor had exaggerated the length of time she worked at the Bank of England.",
      "Reeves has often said she spent the \"best part of a decade\" working at the bank when setting out her credentials to run the economy to voters.",

      "The BBC has now established that Reeves left the Bank of England in March 2006, meaning the time she spent working there amounts to five and a half years.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves confirmed that dates on her LinkedIn were inaccurate and said it was due to an administrative error by the team. Her profile on the social media site has since been updated.",

    "story": [
      "Rachel Reeves has had a difficult start to her ministerial career.",
      "As well as Labour's new chancellor taking on the challenges of the UK economy, she has faced tricky questions about her past.",
      "They began with scrutiny of her online CV late last year.",
      "On the professional networking site LinkedIn, the Chancellor of the Exchequer claimed to have worked as an economist at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) immediately before becoming an MP.",
      "One of those who challenged it was a retired former colleague, Kev Gillett.",
      "In a public post on LinkedIn, which he asked followers to share, he wrote: \"Back in 2009 Rt Hon Rachel Reeves worked 3 levels below me. Just facts. She was a Complaints Support Manager at LBG/HBOS. Not an Economist. #factcheck.\"",
      "In fact it emerged that she had worked in a managerial role within the bank's complaint handling department and her LinkedIn profile was updated to remove the claim.",
      "Rachel Reeves's online CV exaggerated how long she spent working at the Bank of England",
      "Gillett also made another claim about Reeves's time at the bank from 2006 to 2009, writing that she: \"Nearly got sacked due to an expenses scandal where the 3 senior managers were all signing off each others expenses.\"",
      "Reeves's team vigorously denied the allegations.",
      "However, Labour's imminent victory in last summer's general election prompted a post on a private Facebook group for former HBOS employees that BBC News has seen asking if anyone remembered Reeves.",
      "One former employee replied: \"the expenses dept certainly do!\"",
      "Several others made reference to Reeves being investigated over her expenses spending.",
      "BBC News has been seeking the truth behind these suggestions, speaking to more than 20 people, many of whom were former colleagues, and gaining access to receipts, emails and other documents.",
      "We have learnt that there was an expenses investigation into Reeves and two other senior managers.",
      "A detailed six-page whistleblowing complaint and dozens of pages of attached evidence, which we have seen, raised concerns that the three managers were using the bank's money to \"fund a lifestyle\" with allegedly inappropriate spending on dinners, events, taxis and gifts, including for each other.",
      "We have not been able to establish what the final outcome of the investigation was. Indeed it may not have concluded.",
      "But the initial part of the investigation, which was conducted by Internal Audit at the request of the bank's risk department, found that the three managers appeared to have broken the rules and the whistleblower's allegations were substantiated, according to a senior source with knowledge of the investigation.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves said the Chancellor had no knowledge of the investigation, always complied with expenses rules and left the bank on good terms.",
      "Banking career",
      "Reeves was in her 20s and trying to become an MP when she took up a job at Halifax Bank of Scotland in West Yorkshire in 2006.",
      "The role required her to move north from London, where she had unsuccessfully stood as Labour's parliamentary candidate in what had been a safe Conservative seat.",
      "She initially worked in the mortgage department, but in late 2007 moved to become Head of Business Planning in the Customer Relations department, which handled complaints.",
      "Her career at HBOS coincided with what would prove to be a tumultuous time for the bank.",
      "The global financial crisis which began in late summer of 2007 would force the sector to embark on a massive programme of job cuts and cost savings.",
      "In September 2008, HBOS itself came close to collapse, requiring a government-brokered takeover by Lloyds and an emergency bailout which would total \u00a320.5bn of taxpayers' money.",
      "It was shortly after this near-collapse, by early 2009, that a whistleblower from her department raised concerns about the spending habits of Reeves and two other managers, one of whom was Reeves's boss.",
      "Reeves says she won't let critics get her down",
      "MPs raise questions about Rachel Reeves's CV",
      "Rachel Reeves: Playing Labour's first big gambit",
      "Before this, in late 2008, a memo was circulated to Reeves and others which called for tighter cost control in the department.",
      "Written by a planning and strategy manager, the document, \"Financial Risk Control within Customer Relations\", raised concerns about \"spending on travel\" and on corporate spending cards, including Motivation cards which were used to reward staff.",
      "It laid out proposals to \"improve cost controls\" which included monthly discussions with Reeves and another of the senior managers who the whistleblower claimed had mis-used expenses to \"give visibility of claims, invoices, Thanks card use and reports\".",
      "Separately, Reeves was emailed in mid-December 2008 about proposals for a presentation setting out how much had been spent on Motivation cards, recognising top performers and on taxi travel, to \"focus attention on particular aspects of travel that are costly and perhaps need more consideration\".",
      "Reeves replied to say that she was not sure a \"huge analysis\" was needed and she wanted to see the papers before they went any further.",
      "Whistleblower complaint and investigation",
      "The whistleblower's complaint submitted by early 2009 was a six-page document laying out a range of concerns about an alleged spending culture in the Customer Relations department.",
      "It focused on the behaviour of three individuals: Reeves, Reeves's boss, and another senior manager in the department. Reeves's boss, who we are not naming, was responsible for signing off the expenses of the other two managers.",
      "The report and attached receipts and other documents seen by BBC News show Reeves was accused of spending hundreds of pounds on handbags, perfume, earrings and wine for colleagues, including one gift for her boss. Concern was also expressed about her spending on taxis and on a Christmas party. The whistleblower believed the spending to be excessive.",
      "After a call to the whistleblowing hotline, the whistleblower was instructed to hand in a physical copy of their report and supporting evidence, two sources said.",
      "A separate source, who contacted BBC News themselves in the wake of an article on the furore around Reeves's CV last year, was also aware that someone had blown the whistle on Reeves and another colleague.",
      "The report was passed to the bank's risk department and, at their request, was taken on by the Internal Audit department.",
      "A source who worked in risk at the bank told us: \"Given the nature of the allegations \u2013 claiming expenses for things you wouldn't normally claim expenses for \u2013 and the relative seniority of the individuals, the matter was referred for investigation by a team outside of that department.\"",
      "The Internal Audit department, which had access to expenses claims and sign-offs, then assessed the complaint and supporting documents, according to two sources.",
      "It found that there was evidence of apparent wrongdoing by the three senior managers including Reeves, a senior source with direct knowledge of the investigation told BBC News.",
      "Internal Audit completed its involvement in the investigation and passed its findings to an investigative part of the Risk department in around April 2009. The normal process would then have been for the managers to be interviewed about the allegations. There would then be an assessment of potential disciplinary action if necessary.",
      "However it does not appear that this next interview stage took place, or that the investigation ever reached a formal conclusion. Reeves insisted she was never interviewed, as did her boss, who said she was \"not aware of an expenses probe and my departure was not related to any alleged investigation\". The other senior manager declined to comment.",
      "There is no evidence of which we are aware that the bank's internal investigation was completed, or that there was ever a concluding finding of any wrongdoing.",
      "Reeves left the bank in May 2009, as did her boss. The other senior manager was on sick leave in May and never returned to work at the bank.",
      "There is no suggestion any of the departures were linked to the investigation or spending issues and a spokesman for Reeves said the Chancellor left the bank on good terms.",
      "They also provided a statement from the lawyer who provided legal advice on the compromise agreement - a voluntary legal document ending an employee's employment - she signed on her departure.",
      "He said it was a \"standard-style agreement adopted by the company when a mutually agreed exit was made during the bank's restructure\".",
      "\"Absolutely no allegations of wrongdoing or misconduct were mentioned by the HBOS HR team during this process,\" he said.",
      "Expenses allegations",
      "What lay behind the whistleblower's complaint and the grumbles of other colleagues was unhappiness relating to several different areas of spending.",
      "One concern was the use of bank payment cards to pay for Christmas and birthday gifts.",
      "\"A culture developed among senior managers in Customer Relations where gifts were given freely to direct reports  - both upwards and downwards,\" one former colleague of Reeves claimed.",
      "\"[They had] a very cavalier attitude regarding the budget in the department.\"",
      "Reeves and the other senior managers had both a corporate credit card and another payment card known as a 'Motivation' or 'Thanks' card.",
      "The Motivation card was intended to be used to reward high-performers for good work.",
      "There was guidance about its use. In February 2008 a memo instructed HBOS employees on the correct use of Motivation cards, which were widely used within the Customer Relations department.",
      "It stated that the cards were to be used to \"reward/acknowledge colleagues who have gone the extra mile\".",
      "Suggested gifts included \"chocolates, flowers, wine, vouchers or you could simply log on and send a free e-card to say 'Thanks' for a job well done\", the memo said.",
      "It warned that managers would be \"responsible for all transactions on your card and will be held accountable if spending on your statement cannot be verified\".",
      "Spending in this area was scrutinised because the company incurred tax on it.",
      "The memo doesn't explicitly prohibit Christmas and birthday gifts.",
      "But 11 former employees told us they had never heard of colleagues being bought birthday gifts with the bank's money, and believed that doing so was in breach of the rules. Several said any birthday gifts were bought with their own money.",
      "However, one ex-staff member, Jane Wayper, a former HR business partner who was given permission to speak to us by Reeves's team, claimed that \"birthday gifts and Christmas presents could be purchased using Motivation cards\" and \"staff were encouraged to do so for their teams\".",
      "Reeves bought birthday presents for colleagues with HBOS's money throughout her time in Customer Relations, receipts show, with purchases including wine and cosmetics. Some were bought using a Motivation card, while others were reimbursed through an expenses claim.",
      "She also spent \u00a3152 on a handbag and perfume as a present for her boss using the bank's money, according to the whistleblower's report. The present was a joint gift from Reeves and one of the other managers who was later investigated alongside her.",
      "And she bought earrings as a present for her PA, which she claimed back on expenses.",
      "Her PA, Linda Barrowclough, said she had received Christmas and birthday gifts from Reeves but had assumed they were \"personal gifts [and] they'd have come out of her own pocket\".",
      "Reeves also used her Motivation card to spend more than \u00a3400 on a leaving meal for a colleague, which the whistleblowing complaint claimed was not a permitted use.",
      "Christmas gifts",
      "The situation around Christmas gifts, which Reeves also bought for her PA and others, was more complicated.",
      "That's because, according to internal bank guidance we have seen, these could be bought on expenses providing they were small gifts of \u00a325 or less and they were not bought using the Motivation card.",
      "The \u00a325 limit was based on tax advice as anything more substantial would attract tax.",
      "It appeared to her colleagues that Reeves had broken these rules.",
      "But there does appear to have been confusion about the policy. We have also seen emails showing that Reeves was encouraged by her boss to buy more expensive Christmas presents, and to pay for them with her Motivation card.",
      "In late October 2008, Reeves's manager wrote that \"after checking with other departments, it looks like the standard practice of buying\u202fChristmas\u202fgifts for direct reports using motivation bank will continue this year\", emails seen by the BBC show.",
      "She suggested spending \u00a350 to \u00a375 per person on the presents.",
      "A reminder titled \"further clarity\" about how to buy Christmas gifts and how much to spend was circulated by another HBOS employee in early December, emails show.",
      "Reeves and the other managers who were later investigated were all among the recipients of this email confirming the rules on Christmas gifts.",
      "While seasonal gifts, such as at Christmas, were allowed, the managers were explicitly told they could not use Motivation cards for these purchases. The cost of these \"trivial\" gifts was also not allowed to exceed \u00a325, in line with\u202fHMRC guidance, the email said.",
      "This is because rewards for performance at work are taxable whereas seasonal gifts such as those given for Christmas, providing they are not too costly, are exempt.",
      "Replying to the email, Reeves wrote that she didn't understand why the \"goal posts are shifting\" and said she had already ordered and paid for her presents using \"Motivation Bank/Thanks, and I do not intend to cancel them,\" claiming this would cost more time and money.",
      "A colleague responsible for finance acknowledged that the message on paying for Christmas gifts hadn't always been clear but said: \"I don't believe that the goalposts are being moved.\"",
      "Receipts show that gifts bought by Reeves at Christmas 2008 included a \u00a349 handbag for her PA, while she herself received \u00a355 worth of wine from her boss.",
      "Open secret?",
      "There was a widespread belief at the bank that there had been an expenses investigation into Reeves and two colleagues.",
      "But Reeves has said that she has no recollection of being investigated or having questions raised over her expenses.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves said she was \"proud of the work she did at HBOS\" and was not aware of the claims about her expenses until approached by the BBC.",
      "\"She was not aware of an investigation nor was she interviewed, and she did not face any disciplinary action on this or any other matters. All expenses were submitted and signed off in the proper way,\" she said.",
      "The spokesman also said Reeves left in 2009 \"on good terms and received a severance payment, including her full notice pay and bonus\".",
      "\"HBOS allowed her to keep a company car for six months after she left and she was given a favourable reference.\"",
      "Reeves's team put forward several former HBOS employees for interview who they said corroborated her account that she had not been investigated.",
      "One said she hadn't seen evidence of senior managers misusing expenses and the bank had controls to prevent it but she left in February 2008, more than a year before Reeves departed. She also said that she had never heard of giving birthday and Christmas gifts at HBOS's expense as being part of the bank's policies.",
      "Another, Jane Wayper, the former HR business partner, said in a statement that she didn't recognise the accusations against Reeves and \"would have been aware of any investigation which concluded there was a case to answer\" as she would have been involved in the disciplinary process.",
      "She said there was \"extensive oversight of all expenses policies\" and claimed that \"birthday gifts and Christmas presents could be purchased using Motivation cards\". But this is at odds with a document seen by BBC News and the testimony of 11 sources we have spoken to.",
      "Many of Reeves' former HBOS colleagues were worried about the consequences of sharing confidential information with BBC News but believe it is in the public interest for what happened, and their concerns about the now-Chancellor's spending of the bank's money, to be reported.",
      "But, given their concerns about speaking out publicly, we have agreed not to name them.",
      "A Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had no concerns about Reeves's conduct.",
      "Asked whether Sir Keir Starmer still thought the Chancellor had integrity after she updated her career history on LinkedIn, his official spokesman said: \"Yes. The Chancellor and the prime minister are working hand in hand to deliver on the priorities, the plan for change, and to deliver the higher growth and the improvements in living standards that the country needs.\"",
      "The Number 10 official added that the chancellor had gone through the declaration process, which all members of Cabinet go through, when asked if she disclosed that there had been an investigation into her expenses before she was an MP.",

      "Rachel Reeves has had a bumpy first few months in government.",
      "Her tax-hiking Budget prompted criticism from businesses and farmers, and despite Labour putting a pledge to boost the economy at the centre of its plans, growth has been sluggish.",
      "Now the chancellor is facing questions about whether she exaggerated her experience on her online CV and her use of expenses while working in the banking sector before she became an MP.",

      "The Chancellor and her expenses before she became an MP",
      "Reeves was born in south-east London in 1979, just months before Margaret Thatcher became prime minister at a time of immense social and economic change.",
      "She has previously told the BBC her mother would tick off items on a bank statement against receipts while sitting at the kitchen table: \"We weren't poor, but we didn't have money to waste.\"",
      "Her parents separated when she was at primary school, and she and younger sister Ellie, also a Labour MP, were shuttled between separate homes.",
      "During the school holidays, the sisters would spend time with their grandparents in the Northamptonshire town of Kettering.",
      "They would be taken to do the rounds of relatives' houses, who would give them a 20p or 50p piece each. At the end of their week, they were taken to the local toy shop to choose their goodies. While Ellie would spend all her cash, the young Rachel would allow herself a smaller treat and save most of the money.",
      "Decades later, Chancellor Reeves would say that kind of restraint defines her, and she has very much modelled herself on Gordon Brown\u2019s \"prudence\" in the lead-up to Labour\u2019s 1997 election win.",
      "Chess talent",
      "Reeves played chess from an early age, with her father teaching her the key moves. She became a national under-14 champion, and would \"quietly thrash\" any boys who might think they were in for an easy game, according to Ellie.",
      "She has credited chess with teaching her \"to think ahead, to plan a strategy\".",
      "A keen flute player, she took her music GCSE a year early at Beckenham's Cator Park School for Girls, a comprehensive, and would go on to gain four A grades at A-level.",
      "Seeing the extent of cuts at her school, where the library had been turned into a classroom and the sixth form consisted of \"two pre-fab huts in the playground\", she has said she was politicised by her own experience of public services. At the age of 16, she joined the Labour Party.",
      "She went on to study Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford University. As a student, she would host others before college discos, blasting out Destiny's Child songs and dressing up in her room.",
      "Despite her serious demeanour, colleagues and friends have suggested the Labour MP's public persona does not reflect her human side, including a loud laugh and a deep love of Beyonc\u00e9 tracks.",
      "Rachel Reeves: The basics",
      "Age: 46",
      "Place of birth: Lewisham, south-east London",
      "Education: New College, Oxford and the London School of Economics",
      "Family: Married to Nicholas Joicey, a senior civil servant and former speechwriter to Gordon Brown during his time as chancellor. They have two children. Her sister is Labour Party chair Ellie Reeves.",
      "Parliamentary constituency: Leeds West and Pudsey",
      "After graduating, Reeves took on a role as an economist at the Bank of England.",

      "CVs and expenses",
      "Before becoming MP for Leeds West in 2010, Reeves moved to the city and spent time working there for the retail arm of Halifax Bank of Scotland.",
      "Her career at HBOS has now come under scrutiny, after the BBC revealed Reeves and two colleagues were the subject of an expenses probe while she was a senior manager at the bank.",
      "The initial stage of the HBOS investigation found that a whistleblower's complaint was substantiated, and the three employees appeared to have broken the rules, according to a senior source with direct knowledge of the probe.",
      "The BBC has not been able to establish what the final outcome of the investigation was and it might not have concluded.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves said the chancellor had no knowledge of the investigation, always complied with expenses rules and left the bank on good terms.",
      "Reeves has also faced questions about the accuracy of her online CV, which the BBC found exaggerated the length of time she worked at the Bank of England.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves confirmed that dates on her LinkedIn were inaccurate and blamed an administrative error by the team.",
      "Last year, her LinkedIn profile was also changed to describe her role at HBOS as \"Retail Banking\".",
      "It had previously claimed she worked as an economist at the bank, but she instead held a management role in the bank's customer relations department, which dealt with complaints.",
      "Plagiarism row",
      "Entering Parliament in 2010, an early mentor on economic policy was Alistair Darling - the last Labour chancellor, during the financial crisis.",
      "She quickly rose up the party's ranks, shadowing roles at the Treasury, Work and Pensions, and the Cabinet Office.",
      "Throughout Jeremy Corbyn's four and a half years as Labour leader, she remained on the backbenches because she felt she could not endorse his policies. Called a \"Red Tory\" by some in the party, she described this as a \"very unpleasant period\" in an interview with the BBC's Nick Robinson.",
      "A former editor of the BBC's Newsnight programme was forced to issue a written apology to Reeves after calling her \"boring snoring\" on social media in a post that was meant to be a private message.",
      "While she said the incident was \"deeply humiliating\", her key objective after Sir Keir Starmer appointed her shadow chancellor was to portray Labour as a steady, pro-business hand on the economy.",
      "In October 2023, she admitted she \"should have done better\" after it emerged some passages in her book, The Women Who Made Modern Economics, had been lifted from other sources without acknowledgment.",
      "She told the BBC some sentences \"were not properly referenced\" and this would be corrected in future reprints.",
      "'Iron chancellor'",
      "Last July, Reeves became the country's first female chancellor and quickly faced what she described as \"tough choices\".",
      "She claimed a \"black hole\" in the nation's finances meant winter fuel payments would have to be cut for millions of pensioners and National Insurance hiked for employers.",
      "Despite Labour's attempts to win over businesses during the election campaign, many were disappointed they bore the brunt of the \u00a340bn in tax rises announced in her first Budget.",
      "Before winning power, Reeves promised she would govern with \"iron discipline\" and bring stability to the public finances, leading to comparisons with Conservative \"Iron Chancellor\" Margaret Thatcher.",
      "Now Reeves is under pressure to deliver the economic growth promised by her party, while also ensuring people feel better off."

    "summary": "Though 90 of the 157 stranded whales survived, they could not be saved due to complex conditions.",
    "story": [
      "Australian authorities are euthanising about 90 false killer whales which survived a mass stranding on a remote beach in Tasmania.",
      "A team of experts at the site said complex conditions have made it impossible to save them.",
      "They are part of a pod of 157 whales that had beached near Arthur River, in the island's north west. The rest had died shortly after the stranding.",
      "Tasmania has seen a series of mass whale strandings in recent years - including the country's worst-ever in 2020 - but false killer whales haven't mass stranded there in over 50 years.",
      "False killer whales are technically one of world's largest dolphin species, like their orca namesakes. They can grow up to 6m (19ft) and weigh 1.5 tonnes.",
      "Authorities on Wednesday said the pod had been stranded at the site for 24 to 48 hours, and the surviving animals were already under extreme stress.",
      "Local resident Jocelyn Flint told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation she had travelled to the site on Wednesday morning after her son noticed the pod while out shark fishing overnight.",
      "\"There are babies... There's just families of them. Their eyes are open, they're looking at me, like 'help'.\"",
      "\"It's just absolutely horrific.\"",
      "The site - about 300km (186 miles) from the city of Launceston - is extremely difficult to access and transport any rescue equipment to, marine biologist Kris Carlyon told media.",
      "\"This is possibly the trickiest location I've seen in 16 years of doing this role in Tasmania,\" he said.",
      "\"We're talking a very rough, steep, single lane road into the site. We can get four-wheel drives in there, but not a lot else.\"",
      "Rough conditions meant returning the animals to the sea at the location they stranded was impossible, so an expert team tried to relocate two and refloat them, but were unsuccessful.",
      "\"The animals just can't get past the break to get out. They just keep turning around and coming back towards the beach,\" said Shelley Graham, from Tasmania's Parks and Wildlife Service.",
      "With conditions for the next two days forecast to be similar, expert wildlife veterinarians made the \"tough\" and \"confronting\" decision to euthanise the remaining whales.",
      "\"The longer these animals are out stranded, the longer they are suffering. All alternative options have been unsuccessful, euthanasia is always a last resort,\" Dr Carlyon said.",
      "That grim task - which involves shooting the animals -  is expected to begin on Wednesday but continue on Thursday.",
      "Authorities are still working out how to dispose of the carcasses. The site has important cultural heritage for Aboriginal people so a department spokesperson earlier suggested \"it may be a case of... letting nature run its course\".",
      "Authorities have asked members of the public to avoid the site, with bushfires burning nearby and limited road access.",
      "More than 80% of Australian whale strandings take place in Tasmania - often on its west coast.",

      "Whales are highly social mammals and are well known for stranding in groups because they travel in large, close-knit communities which rely on constant communication.",
      "There are a range of theories for why beachings occur. Some experts say the animals can become disoriented after following fish they hunt to the shore.",

    "published": "Sat, 15 Feb 2025 00:45:06 GMT",
    "summary": "The world's frozen oceans keep the planet cool, but they currently have less ice than ever recorded before.",
    "story": [
      "The world's frozen oceans, which help to keep the planet cool, currently have less ice than ever previously recorded, satellite data shows.",
      "Sea-ice around the north and south poles acts like a giant mirror by reflecting much of the Sun's energy back into space.",
      "But as rising temperatures cause this bright layer to shrink, the dark ocean below can absorb more heat, warming the planet further.",
      "This latest sea-ice low appears to have been driven by a combination of warm air, warm seas and winds breaking apart the ice.",
      "Over the 5 days to 13 February, the combined extent of Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice was 15.76 million sq km (6.08 million sq miles), according to BBC analysis of data from the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).",
      "This breaks the previous 5-day record low of 15.93 million sq km (6.15 million sq miles) from January-February 2023.",
      "Arctic sea-ice is currently at its smallest recorded extent for the time of year, while Antarctic sea-ice is close to a new low in satellite records going back to the late 1970s.",
      "The decline of Arctic sea-ice in response to a warming planet is well-established. Its end-of-summer extent fell from an average of 7 million sq km in the 1980s to 4.5 million sq km in the 2010s.",
      "But until the mid-2010s, Antarctic sea-ice had been remarkably resilient, defying predictions that it would shrink.",
      "Since then, Antarctica has shown a series of very low sea-ice extents, although there is still lots of natural variability.",
      "\"Every year, every data point that we get suggests that this isn't a temporary shift, but something more permanent, like what we've seen in the Arctic,\" Walter Meier, senior research scientist at NSIDC, told BBC News.",
      "\"It is indicating that the Antarctic has moved into a new regime of lower ice extents.\"",
      "Antarctic sea-ice is relatively thin and mobile - being surrounded by ocean rather than continents like the Arctic - so it can be particularly sensitive to winds breaking up the ice.",
      "But warmer air and warmer waters look to have played a key role in this latest 2025 low, towards the end of the southern hemisphere summer.",
      "The Antarctic ice-shelves \u2013 ice flowing off the Antarctic continent, rather than sea-ice \u2013 appear to have had a particularly extreme season of surface melting, driven by high air temperatures.",
      "\"Atmospheric conditions in December and January looked like they were strongly promoting surface melting on the ice-shelves,\" said Tom Bracegirdle, research scientist at the British Antarctic Survey.",
      "\"That could also have contributed to what we've seen in Antarctic sea-ice, and ongoing ocean warming is setting the backdrop to all of this as well.\"",
      "Antarctica's record sea-ice low of 2023 would have been a one-in-2,000 year event without climate change, according to a recent study. Yet 2025 is not far from eclipsing it.",
      "At the other end of the planet, the Arctic should be reaching its annual maximum, with cold winter temperatures helping the oceans to freeze over.",
      "But current sea-ice extent is nearly 0.2 million sq km below anything previously recorded for the time of year, and has been tracking very low since late 2024.",
      "This is partly as a result of a late freeze-up of ice around Hudson Bay, with unusually warm ocean waters taking a long time to cool down.",
      "As well as warmer seas, some storms also disrupted ice around the Barents and Bering Seas, with the consequences likely amplified by long-term reductions in sea-ice thickness.",
      "\"A thinner ice cover is more responsive to weather [\u2026 so] weather events can have a stronger impact than they used to,\" said Julienne Stroeve, professor of polar observation and modelling at University College London.",
      "In recent weeks, Arctic sea-ice has moved even further below average. Temperatures around the north pole were about 20C above normal in early February, leading to melting conditions in places like Svalbard.",
      "This \"is quite astonishing\" for the time of year, according to Dr Bracegirdle.",
      "This very low winter extent doesn't necessarily mean the Arctic will end up with record conditions throughout 2025, as conditions can change quickly at the poles.",
      "But, with the Arctic warming nearly four times faster than the global average, declines over the coming decades are almost inevitable.",
      "The Arctic is expected to be essentially free of sea-ice at the end of its summer at least once before 2050, according to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Some recent studies suggest it could happen sooner.",
      "Declining sea-ice at both poles not only has implications for local wildlife like polar bears and penguins, but also the Earth's climate.",
      "Polar sea-ice has already lost around 14% of its natural cooling effect since the early-to-mid 1980s, as the area of bright, reflective ice has declined, according to a study published last year.",
      "\"If you significantly change the sea ice distribution in and around Antarctica, you modify that part of the planet which is actually helping us fight against climate change,\" said Simon Josey, a professor at the National Oceanography Centre.",
      "Sea-ice also plays an important role in the great ocean conveyor, the mass movement of water that helps distribute heat around the planet and keeps places like the UK and north-west Europe relatively mild.",
      "\"If we see another strong winter loss [of Antarctic sea-ice], people are going to start to worry about what it's doing to the ocean circulation,\" said Prof Josey.",

    "published": "Sat, 15 Feb 2025 00:45:06 GMT",
    "summary": "The world's frozen oceans keep the planet cool, but they currently have less ice than ever recorded before.",
    "story": [
      "The world's frozen oceans, which help to keep the planet cool, currently have less ice than ever previously recorded, satellite data shows.",
      "Sea-ice around the north and south poles acts like a giant mirror by reflecting much of the Sun's energy back into space.",
      "But as rising temperatures cause this bright layer to shrink, the dark ocean below can absorb more heat, warming the planet further.",
      "This latest sea-ice low appears to have been driven by a combination of warm air, warm seas and winds breaking apart the ice.",
      "Over the 5 days to 13 February, the combined extent of Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice was 15.76 million sq km (6.08 million sq miles), according to BBC analysis of data from the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).",
      "This breaks the previous 5-day record low of 15.93 million sq km (6.15 million sq miles) from January-February 2023.",
      "Arctic sea-ice is currently at its smallest recorded extent for the time of year, while Antarctic sea-ice is close to a new low in satellite records going back to the late 1970s.",
      "The decline of Arctic sea-ice in response to a warming planet is well-established. Its end-of-summer extent fell from an average of 7 million sq km in the 1980s to 4.5 million sq km in the 2010s.",
      "But until the mid-2010s, Antarctic sea-ice had been remarkably resilient, defying predictions that it would shrink.",
      "Since then, Antarctica has shown a series of very low sea-ice extents, although there is still lots of natural variability.",
      "\"Every year, every data point that we get suggests that this isn't a temporary shift, but something more permanent, like what we've seen in the Arctic,\" Walter Meier, senior research scientist at NSIDC, told BBC News.",
      "\"It is indicating that the Antarctic has moved into a new regime of lower ice extents.\"",
      "Antarctic sea-ice is relatively thin and mobile - being surrounded by ocean rather than continents like the Arctic - so it can be particularly sensitive to winds breaking up the ice.",
      "But warmer air and warmer waters look to have played a key role in this latest 2025 low, towards the end of the southern hemisphere summer.",
      "The Antarctic ice-shelves \u2013 ice flowing off the Antarctic continent, rather than sea-ice \u2013 appear to have had a particularly extreme season of surface melting, driven by high air temperatures.",
      "\"Atmospheric conditions in December and January looked like they were strongly promoting surface melting on the ice-shelves,\" said Tom Bracegirdle, research scientist at the British Antarctic Survey.",
      "\"That could also have contributed to what we've seen in Antarctic sea-ice, and ongoing ocean warming is setting the backdrop to all of this as well.\"",
      "Antarctica's record sea-ice low of 2023 would have been a one-in-2,000 year event without climate change, according to a recent study. Yet 2025 is not far from eclipsing it.",
      "At the other end of the planet, the Arctic should be reaching its annual maximum, with cold winter temperatures helping the oceans to freeze over.",
      "But current sea-ice extent is nearly 0.2 million sq km below anything previously recorded for the time of year, and has been tracking very low since late 2024.",
      "This is partly as a result of a late freeze-up of ice around Hudson Bay, with unusually warm ocean waters taking a long time to cool down.",
      "As well as warmer seas, some storms also disrupted ice around the Barents and Bering Seas, with the consequences likely amplified by long-term reductions in sea-ice thickness.",
      "\"A thinner ice cover is more responsive to weather [\u2026 so] weather events can have a stronger impact than they used to,\" said Julienne Stroeve, professor of polar observation and modelling at University College London.",
      "In recent weeks, Arctic sea-ice has moved even further below average. Temperatures around the north pole were about 20C above normal in early February, leading to melting conditions in places like Svalbard.",
      "This \"is quite astonishing\" for the time of year, according to Dr Bracegirdle.",
      "This very low winter extent doesn't necessarily mean the Arctic will end up with record conditions throughout 2025, as conditions can change quickly at the poles.",
      "But, with the Arctic warming nearly four times faster than the global average, declines over the coming decades are almost inevitable.",
      "The Arctic is expected to be essentially free of sea-ice at the end of its summer at least once before 2050, according to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Some recent studies suggest it could happen sooner.",
      "Declining sea-ice at both poles not only has implications for local wildlife like polar bears and penguins, but also the Earth's climate.",
      "Polar sea-ice has already lost around 14% of its natural cooling effect since the early-to-mid 1980s, as the area of bright, reflective ice has declined, according to a study published last year.",
      "\"If you significantly change the sea ice distribution in and around Antarctica, you modify that part of the planet which is actually helping us fight against climate change,\" said Simon Josey, a professor at the National Oceanography Centre.",
      "Sea-ice also plays an important role in the great ocean conveyor, the mass movement of water that helps distribute heat around the planet and keeps places like the UK and north-west Europe relatively mild.",
      "\"If we see another strong winter loss [of Antarctic sea-ice], people are going to start to worry about what it's doing to the ocean circulation,\" said Prof Josey.",

      "OpenAI's board of directors has officially rejected Elon Musk's nearly $100bn offer for the maker of what is the world's best-known artificial intelligence (AI) tool, ChatGPT.",
      "But the unsolicited bid might not be a failure - at least as far as Musk is concerned, experts say.",
      "That's because the offer could still complicate CEO Sam Altman's plans to transform OpenAI from a non-profit controlled entity to a for-profit company.",
      "Musk is \"basically trying to stymie OpenAI's growth trajectory,\" said University of Cambridge associate teaching professor Johnnie Penn in an interview with the BBC.",
      "Profit & non-profit",
      "Last week, Musk and a consortium of investors including Hollywood superagent Ari Emanuel tabled a $97.4bn (\u00a378.4bn) offer for all of OpenAI's assets.",
      "It was a huge sum - but less than the $157bn the firm was valued at in a funding round just four months ago, and much lower than the $300bn that some think it is worth now.",
      "Complicating all of this is OpenAI's unusual structure which involves a partnership between non-profit and for-profit arms.",
      "Mr Altman is understood to want to change that, stripping it of its non-profit board.",
      "That involves costs which Mr Musk is seemingly trying to inflate.",
      "\"What Musk is trying to do here is raise the perceived value of the non-profit arm of OpenAI, so that OpenAI has to pay more to get out of the obligations it has to its own non-profit,\" said Dr Penn.",

      "\"Musk has missed the AI train, somewhat. He's behind, and he has made several attempts to catch up,\" Mr Finger said.",
      "Now, Mr Finger says, Mr Musk is trying to kneecap his most formidable competitor.",
      "An already-tense relationship appeared to worsen further last week with Mr Altman taunting Mr Musk's offer on X, and Mr Musk retorting by calling his onetime partner a \"swindler\".",
      "Mr Altman then hit back in an interview with Bloomberg, opining that Mr Musk is not \"a happy person\" and saying his decisions are made from a \"position of insecurity\".",

    "summary": "Google is allowing advertisers to collect more personal information, which is harder for users to control.",
    "story": [
      "Privacy campaigners have called Google's new rules on tracking people online \"a blatant disregard for user privacy.\"",
      "Changes which come in on Sunday permit so-called \"fingerprinting\", which allows online advertisers to collect more data about users including their IP addresses and information about their devices.",
      "Google says this data is already widely used by other companies, and it continues to encourage responsible data use.",
      "However the company had previously come out strongly against this kind of data collection, saying in a 2019 blog that fingerprinting \"subverts user choice and is wrong.\"",
      "But in a post announcing the new rule changes, Google said the way people used the internet - such as devices like smart TVs and consoles - meant it was harder to target ads to users using conventional data collection, which users control with cookie consent.",
      "It also says more privacy options provide safety to users.",
      "Google told the BBC in a statement: \"Privacy-enhancing technologies offer new ways for our partners to succeed on emerging platforms... without compromising on user privacy.\"",
      "But opponents to the change say fingerprinting and IP address collection are a blow to privacy because it is harder for users to control what data is collected about them.",
      "\"By allowing fingerprinting, Google has given itself - and the advertising industry it dominates - permission to use a form of tracking that people can't do much to stop,\" said Martin Thomson, distinguished engineer at Mozilla, a rival to Google.",
      "What is fingerprinting?",
      "Fingerprinting collects information about a person's device and browser and puts it together to create a profile of that person.",
      "The information is not explicitly collected in order to advertise to people, but it can be used to target specific ads based on that user's data.",
      "For example, a person's screen size or language settings are legitimately needed in order to display a website properly.",
      "But when that is combined with their time zone, browser type, battery level - and many other data points - it can create a unique combination of settings which makes it easier to work out who is using a web service.",
      "These details along with someone's IP address - the unique identifier used by internet devices - were previously prohibited by Google for ad targeting.",
      "Privacy campaigners say that unlike cookies, which are small files stored on a local device, users have little control over whether they send fingerprinting information to advertisers.",
      "\"By explicitly allowing a tracking technique that they previously described as incompatible with user control, Google highlights its ongoing prioritisation of profits over privacy,\" said Lena Cohen, staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.",
      "\"The same tracking techniques that Google claims are essential for online advertising also expose individuals' sensitive information to data brokers, surveillance companies, and law enforcement,\" she added.",
      "'Irresponsible' change",
      "\"My argument would be that fingerprinting sits in a little bit of a grey area,\" says Pete Wallace, from advertising technology company GumGum.",
      "\"Should people feel comfortable staying in a grey area of privacy? I'd say no,\" he adds.",
      "GumGum, which has worked with the BBC on ad campaigns before, relies on something called contextual advertising, which uses other data points to target adverts to online users, such as keywords on the website they are on - rather than their personal data.",
      "Mr Wallace says allowing fingerprinting represents a shift in the industry.",
      "\"Fingerprinting feels like it's taking a much more business-centric approach to the use of consumer data rather than a consumer-centric approach,\" he says.",
      "\"This sort of flip-flopping is, in my opinion, detrimental to that route that the industry seemed to be taking towards this idea of really putting consumer privacy at the forefront.\"",
      "He adds that he hopes ad tech companies conclude \"that it isn't the appropriate way to use consumer data,\" but expects them to look at fingerprinting as an option in order to better target adverts.",
      "Advertising is the lifeblood of the internet business model, and allow many websites to be freely available to users without them having to directly pay to access them.",
      "But in return, users often have to give up private information about themselves so that advertisers can show them relevant adverts.",
      "The UK's data watchdog, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), says \"fingerprinting is not a fair means of tracking users online because it is likely to reduce people's choice and control over how their information is collected.\"",
      "In a blog post in December, the ICO's Executive Director of Regulatory Risk Stephen Almond wrote: \"We think this change is irresponsible.\"",
      "He added that advertisers and businesses which decide to use this technology will have to demonstrate how they are staying within data and privacy laws in the UK.",

      "The move by the UK government has stunned experts and worried privacy campaigners, with Privacy International calling it  an \"unprecedented attack\" on the private data of individuals.",
      "However the US government has previously asked Apple to break its encryption as part of criminal investigations.",
      "In 2016, Apple resisted a court order to write software which would allow US officials to access the iPhone of a gunman - though this was resolved after the FBI were able to successfully access the device.",

      "It is understood that the UK government does not want to start combing through everybody's data.",

    "summary": "Researchers have given a robot a powerful radio-based vision system which can see through smoke.",
    "story": [
      "If you want to find out whether your robot can see through smoke, well, you're going to need some smoke.",
      "But a University of Pennsylvania student got a shock when they began setting up a late night experiment to test such a robot.",
      "Shortly after flicking the switch on the smoke machine, a loud fire alarm went off.",
      "\"The whole building got triggered,\" says Mingmin Zhao of the University of Pennsylvania, smiling. \"My student called me. He was very surprised.\"",
      "The incident was a minor setback for the team developing a robot equipped with a innovative radio-based sensing system.",
      "Radio waves could allow robots or autonomous vehicles to see through thick smoke, intense rain \u2013 or even around corners. Such waves can even detect concealed weapons.",
      "But simulating visual imagery based on radio waves is an unusual approach for robots and autonomous vehicles. Much more established in those fields are regular optical cameras, light detection and ranging (Lidar), and other sensors.",
      "However, Prof Zhao and his students have developed a potentially powerful way for robots to see using radio waves.",
      "Of course radar, which uses radio waves, has been used for decades to track aircraft, ships and the weather.",
      "But the spinning array on Prof Zhao's robot throws radio waves in all directions.",
      "An on-board artificial intelligence (AI) system then builds a 3D view of the environment with this information.",
      "\"What we have been trying to do here is basically help robots obtain superhuman vision \u2013 to see in scenarios where human eyes or traditional visual sensors cannot,\" explains Prof Zhao.",
      "He suggests the technology could help a future search-and-rescue robot save people from a burning building.",
      "Subsequent tests of the bot used a clear plastic box full of smoke placed around the its spinning equipment, in order to avoid triggering any nearby fire alarms.",
      "Although humans can't see them, radio waves are a form of light in the sense that they are part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which also includes X-rays and gamma rays. Only a small part the spectrum is classed as visible light.",
      "Being light, radio waves can reflect off surfaces and materials, though in a slightly different way to visible light. Prof Zhao and his colleagues have designed their robot so that it can sense these radio wave reflections.",
      "The crucial factor here is that radio waves are much longer than visible light waves meaning they are not blocked by tiny smoke particles.",
      "Prof Zhao says he has also been working on adapting the technology so that the robot can see part of the way round a corner. Think of it like a hall of mirrors, he suggests, just for radio waves rather than visible light.",
      "\"It's really very interesting work and quite impressive,\" says Friedemann Reinhard at the University of Rostock in Germany, who was not involved in the work. In 2017, Prof Reinhard and colleagues described how Wi-Fi signals could allow spies to see into private rooms.",
      "One slight limitation is that the spinning array cannot, by definition, see in all directions at once. Prof Reinhard says that a lot of data processing carried out by the system appears necessary to clean up the image that results from this spinning device.",
      "However, the robot sends out radio waves in the millimetre wave band (waves that are between one and ten millimetres long). This is the same technology used for some 5G installations.",
      "\"That's potentially very attractive, it's a very well understood, cheap technology,\" says Prof Reinhard. \"I certainly would love to see a self-driving car driving only on radar.\"",
      "But it is possible to avoid using spinning radio-emitting devices to get a full picture, says Fabio da Silva, founder and chief executive of US firm Wavsens, which is also developing radio-based sensing technology.",
      "\"We created an algorithm that allows you to sense the entire space instantaneously and continuously so we don't have to spin our antennas,\" he says.",
      "He describes the system as akin to echolocation, used by bats. It sends out radio waves and \"listens\" to how the waves come back, which reveals the shape of whatever they have hit.",
      "Some researchers have used radio waves to detect concealed weapons such as hidden handguns and knives.",
      "Radio waves can even \"fingerprint\" the details of a room. Then, if scanned again later, this would reveal whether any objects in the room have been moved.",
      "Last year, scientists in Germany proposed that countries use this method to scrutinise other countries' management of their nuclear weapons stockpiles. It would be one way of knowing whether someone had been moving the warheads around, for example.",
      "Separately, Luana Olivieri at Loughborough University has explored using a different form of non-visible electromagnetic radiation, terahertz waves. These are shorter than radio waves but longer than visible light waves. \"This wavelength is particularly unexplored,\" says Dr Olivieri.",
      "It is possible to see through objects and analyse materials using this form of radiation, she adds. Such a system could even, in theory, identify specific drugs by detecting their chemical structure.",
      "But while seeing through materials could help a rescue bot find a trapped person in some future disaster, it also has other applications. Police forces and militaries have access to radio-based technology that allows them to see through doors and walls, to some extent.",
      "\"Warfighting is definitely one market that it caters to. It can be used to find and kill someone,\" says Mr da Silva. He has exhibited Wavsens' technology to the US Department of Defense and the Israeli Ministry of Defense, he says.",
      "And yet these applications are not entirely surprising, suggests Prof Reinhard, who points out that a range of emerging technologies have, in principle, made it easier to detect and attack people.",
      "\"Maybe radar sounds scary \u2013 but drones and cheap cameras are the much more dangerous thing,\" he says."

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump has taken aim at Ukraine after its President, Volodymyr Zelensky, said it was a \"surprise\" his country had not been invited to talks in Saudi Arabia on ending the war with Russia.",
      "Saying he was \"disappointed\" by Ukraine's reaction, he appeared to blame Ukraine for starting the war, saying the country \"could have made a deal\" earlier.",
      "A full-scale Russian invasion sparked the war in Ukraine almost three years ago.",
      "Earlier on Tuesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov met US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Riyadh for the first high-level, face-to-face talks between the two countries since the invasion, and agreed to appoint teams to start negotiating the end of the war.",
      "Lavrov said his country would not accept peacekeeping forces from Nato countries in Ukraine under any peace deal, a proposal raised at a meeting of European members of Nato in Paris on Monday.",
      "European Nato states, who remain committed to supporting Ukraine against Russia, have been smarting at being sidelined by Trump's unilateral peace initiative, which reversed the resolutely pro-Ukraine policy of his predecessor as president, Joe Biden.",
      "Following what he referred to as \"the infamous meeting\" - to which Ukraine was not invited either - Zelensky accused the Russian delegation in Riyadh of lying, adding that Russia could not be trusted and \"must be pressured for peace\".",
      "Speaking to reporters at his Mar-a-Lago residence, Trump was asked by BBC News what his message was to Ukrainians who might feel betrayed.",
      "\"I hear that they're upset about not having a seat, well, they've had a seat for three years and a long time before that. This could have been settled very easily,\" he said.",
      "\"You should have never started it. You could have made a deal,\" he later added.",
      "\"I could have made a deal for Ukraine,\" he said. \"That would have given them almost all of the land, everything, almost all of the land - and no people would have killed, and no city would have been demolished.\"",
      "After the meeting in Riyadh, Trump said he was \"much more confident\".",
      "\"They were very good,\" he said. \"Russia wants to do something. They want to stop the savage barbarianism.\"",
      "\"I think I have the power to end this war,\" he added.",

      "Who was at the table at US-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia?",
      "How much do Nato members spend on defence?",
      "Listen to Ukrainecast: How pleased is Putin?",
      "Trump also criticised the length of time since an election was held in Ukraine, when asked if the US would support Russian demands for one to be held.",
      "\"They want a seat at the table, but... wouldn't the people of Ukraine have a say? It's been a long time since we've had an election,\" the president responded.",
      "He also claimed Zelensky - who won a five-year term in 2019 - was \"down at 4% approval rating\".",
      "Zelensky has remained in office while the country has been under martial law following the onset of the conflict. One opinion poll in December suggested 52% of Ukrainians surveyed said they \"trust\" Zelensky.",
      "Meanwhile, when asked about the prospect of European countries sending troops to Ukraine, Trump said: \"If they want to do that, that's great, I'm all for it.\"",
      "However, he added of a potential US deployment of troops: \"We won't have to put any over there because, you know, we're very far away.\"",
      "After Monday's meeting in Paris, British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said any Ukraine peace deal would require a \"US backstop\" to deter Russia from attacking its neighbour again.",
      "Sir Keir said a \"US security guarantee was the only way to effectively deter Russia\", and vowed to discuss the \"key elements\" of a peace deal with Trump in Washington next week.",
      "Also at the talks in Riyadh were US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, as well as Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov and the head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, Kirill Dmitriev.",
      "Stressing that Moscow would not agree to peacekeeping forces from Nato countries in Ukraine under any peace deal, Lavrov said: \"Any appearance by armed forces under some other flag does not change anything. It is of course completely unacceptable.\"",
      "He said the US and Russia would appoint ambassadors to each other's countries as soon as possible and create conditions to \"restore co-operation in full\".",
      "\"It was a very useful conversation. We listened to each other, and we heard each other,\" he said.",
      "He reiterated Russia's previous position that any expansion of the Nato defence alliance - and Ukraine joining it - would be a \"direct threat\" to Russia.",
      "Rubio for his part said he was \"convinced\" Russia was \"willing to begin to engage in a serious process\" to end the conflict.",
      "\"There has to be concessions made by all sides. We're not going to predetermine what those are.\"",
      "\"Today is the first step of a long and difficult journey, but an important one\", he added.",
      "Rubio said the European Union was going to \"have to be at the table at some point because they have sanctions as well that have been imposed\".",
      "On the absence of Ukraine at the meeting, he insisted \"no-one is being sidelined\".",
      "\"Everyone involved in that conflict has to be OK with it, it has to be acceptable to them,\" he added.",
      "The talks in Paris, which were hastily arranged in response to the apparent rapprochement between Russia and the US under Trump, did not agree a unified position.",
      "Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz said discussing sending troops to Ukraine at present was \"completely premature\".",
      "Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk also said he did not intend to send troops while Italy's Giorgia Meloni - the only European leader to attend Trump's inauguration - expressed doubts.",
      "She told the meeting in Paris that deploying European troops would be \"the most complex and the least effective\" way of securing peace in Ukraine.",
      "Ukraine's leader looked visibly tired and upset when he gave his reaction to the Riyadh meeting during a news conference in Turkey.",
      "\"We want everything to be fair and so that nobody decides anything behind our back,\" Zelensky said.",
      "\"You cannot make decisions without Ukraine on how to end the war in Ukraine.\"",
      "He will be alarmed by all the smiles on both American and Russian faces in Riyadh, but he will know that he can do little to change whatever they agree on over his head.",
      "The Ukrainian president will also know that his country's chances of resisting - let alone defeating - Russian troops without American help are very slim.",
      "Following the overthrow of Ukraine's pro-Russian president in 2014, Moscow annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and backed pro-Russian separatists in bloody fighting in eastern Ukraine.",
      "The conflict burst into all-out war when Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022.",
      "Moscow's attempts to take control of the capital Kyiv were thwarted, but Russian forces have taken around one-fifth of Ukraine's territory in the east and south, and have carried out air strikes across the country.",
      "Ukraine has retaliated with artillery and drone strikes, as well as a ground offensive against Russia's western Kursk region.",
      "Accurate casualty counts are hard to come by but it is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people, most of them soldiers, have been killed or injured, and millions of Ukrainian civilians have fled as refugees.",

    "story": [
      "Rapper A$AP Rocky has been found not guilty of firing a gun at a former friend.",
      "A jury in Los Angeles acquitted the musician, whose legal name is Rakim Mayers, on two felony assault charges that carried up to 24 years in prison.",
      "Terell Ephron claimed the Grammy-nominated hip-hop star opened fire at him during an argument on a Hollywood street on 6 November 2021, grazing his knuckles with one of the shots.",
      "Mr Mayers, who is also a fashion mogul and the longtime partner of pop star Rihanna, denied the charges, arguing that the weapon was a prop gun and that his former friend, who calls himself A$AP Relli, was only after money.",
      "As the first not-guilty verdict was read on Tuesday, the court rang with screams and clapping. Mr Mayers rushed towards his family and Rihanna, who were seated behind him. He dived over a wooden barrier to embrace them.",
      "Rihanna had been a repeated presence in court during the trial, and for Tuesday's verdict, brought along their two sons, two-year-old RZA and one-year-old Riot.",
      "Mr Mayers also hugged his lawyers and appeared to have tears in his eyes as the second not-guilty verdict was read.",
      "\"Thank God for saving my life,\" Mr Mayers said aloud. He thanked members of the 12-person jury.",
      "The rapper was arrested on the two felony assault charges after a heated argument with his former friend in the heart of Hollywood.",

      "\"He looked me in my eyes and pointed the gun at me,\" Mr Ephron testified.",
      "Mr Ephron said he told the rapper to fire the weapon, but Mr Mayers started walking away. As he left, Mr Ephron followed, shouting at him.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that at this point, Mr Mayers once again pulled out the gun and fired multiple shots, with one bullet said to have grazed Mr Ephron's knuckles.",
      "Much of the trial hinged on whether the firearm in question was a harmless prop gun, as Mr Mayers's defence said, or a real weapon capable of causing harm, as Mr Ephron and prosecutors alleged.",
      "The weapon has not been recovered by authorities.",
      "Jurors were able to watch some footage of the altercation because parts were captured on surveillance video, including audio of gunfire, but no video evidence directly showed any shooting.",
      "Mr Ephron took two days before reporting the incident to authorities and brought shell casings he said he had retrieved from the scene.",
      "But police who responded to reports of a shooting in the area did not locate any shell casings. Mr Ephron, who said he returned with his girlfriend hours later, said he knew exactly where to look, but no surveillance footage corroborates his account.",
      "He was not admitted to hospital in Los Angeles and instead went for medical treatment after flying back to New York.",
      "Lawyers for Mr Mayers suggested that Mr Ephron had planted the shell casings to frame the rapper.",
      "The trial was marked by emotional and combative exchanges, particularly when Mr Ephron - the trial's star witness - took the stand.",

      "Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has been charged by the country's chief prosecutor with attempting a coup after he was defeated in the 2022 presidential election.",
      "The 69-year-old was handed five charges over the alleged bid to prevent his successor, President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, from taking office after a bitter election race.",
      "The charges include allegations that he planned to poison Lula and shoot dead Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes.",
      "Bolsonaro denies wrongdoing and says he is the victim of political persecution.",
      "The prosecutor's advice will now be considered by the Supreme Court. If accepted, Bolsonaro and 33 others will be formally charged and will have to face trial.",
      "The former president was banned from running for office for eight years after being accused of undermining Brazilian democracy by falsely claiming that electronic ballots used in the October 2022 poll were vulnerable to hacking and fraud.",
      "The bitterly fought election was won by an extremely narrow margin by President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva - known more commonly as Lula.",
      "Bolsonaro never publicly acknowledged his defeat and left Brazil for the US two days before Lula was sworn in as president.",
      "On 8 January 2023, his supporters stormed government buildings in the capital Brasilia. Parts of the buildings were ransacked and police arrested 1,500 of the rioters.",
      "Three months ago, the federal police released a report accusing Bolsonaro of playing a lead role in planning and organising an attempted coup - including by proposing the idea to key figures in the military - to stop Lula taking power.",
      "The document charging Bolsonaro says the responsibility for acts that were harmful to democratic order lies with a criminal organisation led by Bolsonaro himself.",
      "In practice, this means legal proceedings are beginning and Bolsonaro will likely face a trial.",

      "Brazilian media reports that the Supreme Court is expected to proceed with the trial later this year.",
      "Reaction to the prosecutor's decision shows that the divisions that have marked Brazilian politics for the past decade remain as deep as ever.",
      "Government supporters are celebrating and saying the former president belongs in jail, while the opposition insist he's innocent.",
      "The focus now is on the impact the Supreme Court decision will have on next year's presidential election. Recent opinion polls show record levels of rejection for President Lula.",
      "Despite being banned from running for office, Bolsonaro remains a strong political force in Brazil and could use the trial as a platform for his agenda."

    "summary": "Though 90 of the 157 stranded whales survived, they could not be saved due to complex conditions.",
    "story": [
      "Australian authorities are euthanising about 90 false killer whales which survived a mass stranding on a remote beach in Tasmania.",
      "A team of experts at the site said complex conditions have made it impossible to save them.",
      "They are part of a pod of 157 whales that had beached near Arthur River, in the island's north west. The rest had died shortly after the stranding.",
      "Tasmania has seen a series of mass whale strandings in recent years - including the country's worst-ever in 2020 - but false killer whales haven't mass stranded there in over 50 years.",
      "False killer whales are technically one of world's largest dolphin species, like their orca namesakes. They can grow up to 6m (19ft) and weigh 1.5 tonnes.",
      "Authorities on Wednesday said the pod had been stranded at the site for 24 to 48 hours, and the surviving animals were already under extreme stress.",
      "Local resident Jocelyn Flint told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation she had travelled to the site on Wednesday morning after her son noticed the pod while out shark fishing overnight.",
      "\"There are babies... There's just families of them. Their eyes are open, they're looking at me, like 'help'.\"",
      "\"It's just absolutely horrific.\"",
      "The site - about 300km (186 miles) from the city of Launceston - is extremely difficult to access and transport any rescue equipment to, marine biologist Kris Carlyon told media.",
      "\"This is possibly the trickiest location I've seen in 16 years of doing this role in Tasmania,\" he said.",
      "\"We're talking a very rough, steep, single lane road into the site. We can get four-wheel drives in there, but not a lot else.\"",
      "Rough conditions meant returning the animals to the sea at the location they stranded was impossible, so an expert team tried to relocate two and refloat them, but were unsuccessful.",
      "\"The animals just can't get past the break to get out. They just keep turning around and coming back towards the beach,\" said Shelley Graham, from Tasmania's Parks and Wildlife Service.",
      "With conditions for the next two days forecast to be similar, expert wildlife veterinarians made the \"tough\" and \"confronting\" decision to euthanise the remaining whales.",
      "\"The longer these animals are out stranded, the longer they are suffering. All alternative options have been unsuccessful, euthanasia is always a last resort,\" Dr Carlyon said.",
      "That grim task - which involves shooting the animals -  is expected to begin on Wednesday but continue on Thursday.",
      "Authorities are still working out how to dispose of the carcasses. The site has important cultural heritage for Aboriginal people so a department spokesperson earlier suggested \"it may be a case of... letting nature run its course\".",
      "Authorities have asked members of the public to avoid the site, with bushfires burning nearby and limited road access.",
      "More than 80% of Australian whale strandings take place in Tasmania - often on its west coast.",
      "Around 470 pilot whales were stranded further south at Macquarie Harbour in 2020 and about 350 of them died despite rescue efforts. Another 200 become stranded in the same harbour in 2022.",
      "Whales are highly social mammals and are well known for stranding in groups because they travel in large, close-knit communities which rely on constant communication.",
      "There are a range of theories for why beachings occur. Some experts say the animals can become disoriented after following fish they hunt to the shore.",
      "Others believe that one individual can mistakenly lead whole groups to shore.",

      "Ryuji Kimura, 25, hurled a pipe bomb at Kishida as the country's leader approached a crowd for a speech during an election event in the city of Wakayama.",
      "Although Kishida was unharmed, the explosion of the homemade device caused minor injuries to a police officer and a member of the public.",
      "The attack shocked Japan as it came less than a year after former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was shot dead at an outdoor election campaign event.",
      "Kimura, who was sentenced on Wednesday, claimed during questioning his intention was not to kill Kishida, but to object to the country's election age regulation which prevented him from getting into politics.",
      "The minimum age to become a member of parliament in Japan is 25 for the House of Representatives and 30 for the House of Councillors.",
      "Kimura further added that he threw the bomb to bring attention to a civil lawsuit he filed in 2022, claiming the age restriction was unconstitutional, which was dismissed.",
      "Kimura's defence argued he should not face a charge of attempted murder, as he did not expect the bomb to cause injuries, and that a three-year prison sentence would be reasonable given the extent of those injuries.",
      "The court stated, however, that the explosives were powerful enough to cause fatal damage.",
      "When handing down the ruling, presiding judge Keiko Fukushima noted that \"targeting a serving prime minister caused significant anxiety to society as a whole.\"",
      "In addition to the attempted murder charge, Kimura was also found guilty of violating explosives regulations and firearms control laws.",

      "While violent attacks are extremely rare in Japan, anxiety around politicians' security has surged in the wake of Abe's assassination in 2022.",
      "The attempted attack on Kishida, which came less than a year later, raised questions as to why there was not a tighter security presence around the country's leader at that time."

      "While news of the bounty has provoked scorn on social media, Mr Cernal has defended it as necessary for the community's health.",
      "The move follows a recent spike in cases of dengue, which is spread by mosquitoes, in the Philippines.",
      "The programme, which will run for at least a month, was started after two students in Mr Cernal's neighbourhood died from the disease.",
      "The bounty applies to all mosquitoes - dead or alive - and their larvae, Mr Cernal added. Live mosquitoes will be exterminated using ultraviolet light.",
      "A total of 21 people have already claimed their reward, bringing in a total of 700 mosquitoes and larvae so far,  he told the BBC.",
      "The bounty drew swift ridicule after it was announced late on Tuesday.",
      "\"Mosquito farming is coming,\" one social media comment read. \"Will a mosquito get rejected if it has only one wing?\" read another.",
      "The Philippines' Department of Health (DOH) told the BBC that it \"appreciates the good intentions of local government executives to fight dengue\".",
      "It declined further comment, however, when asked if catching mosquitoes in exchange for cash is an effective way of stopping dengue.",
      "\"We urge all concerned to please consult and coordinate with their local health officers or the DOH regional office in their area for evidence-based practices that are known to work,\" it said.",
      "Mr Cernal said he was aware that the bounty had been bashed on social media, but added: \"This is one of the biggest and most dense areas. We have to do something to help the local government.\"",
      "He pointed out that local health authorities recorded 44 cases of dengue in the community during the most recent surge of infections.",
      "Barangay Addition Hills is home to nearly 70,000 people, crammed into a 162-hectare patch at the heart of the capital, Metro Manila.",
      "Mr Cernal said the bounty was meant to supplement existing measures such as cleaning the streets and preventing the build-up of water where dengue-carrying mosquitoes lay their eggs.",
      "Dengue is endemic in tropical countries, and outbreaks often occur in urban areas with poor sanitation which allows virus-carrying mosquitoes to multiply.",
      "In severe cases, dengue causes internal bleeding which can lead to death. Its symptoms include headaches, nausea, joint and muscle pain.",
      "Philippine authorities have recently flagged a rise in dengue cases nationwide due to seasonal rains. The DOH said it recorded 28,234 cases on 1 February, a 40% jump from the previous year.",
      "The department has advised the public to maintain the cleanliness of their surroundings, destroy potential mosquito breeding sites such as tyres, wear long-sleeved shirts and trousers and apply mosquito repellent.",
      "Aside from dengue, the DOH said the rains have also fuelled a spike in influenza-like diseases and cases of leptospirosis, a rat-borne disease that people get when wading in flood waters."

    "summary": "A new energy plan cites growing demand from power-hungry AI data centres and semiconductor plants.",
    "story": [
      "Japan says it will increase its reliance on nuclear energy in a major policy shift as it seeks to meet growing demand from power-hungry sectors like AI and semiconductors.",
      "An energy plan approved by the cabinet on Tuesday called for \"maximising the use of nuclear energy\" and dropped reference to \"reducing reliance on nuclear energy\".",
      "The energy plan, written by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry says that by 2040, nuclear energy should account for 20% of Japan's grid supply in 2040, more than double the 8.5% share in 2023.",
      "It comes as the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster from 14 years ago continues to hang over the country, conjuring painful memories.",
      "In March 2011, a 9.0-magnitude earthquake near Japan's north-east coast spawned a tsunami that killed more than 18,000 people, wiping out entire towns and flooding the reactors of the Fukushima Daiichi plant.",
      "Japan now operates 14 commercial nuclear reactors, compared to 54 before the Fukushima disaster when 30% of the country's energy was from nuclear sources.",
      "The plan still needs approval by parliament, where it will be discussed in the coming months.",
      "The country, which imports 90% of its fuel, needs to look to nuclear sources as part of its plan to cut back on carbon and be self-reliant on energy, said Daishiro Yamagiwa, an MP who was part of a government advisory committee on the energy plan.",
      "\"Because of the conflict in Ukraine and the war in the Middle East, even fossil fuels have become difficult to buy,\" he told the BBC. \"Japan is a country without energy resources, so we must use whatever is available in a balanced way.\"",
      "Yamagiwa added that energy burdens are growing because of demand from AI data processing centres and semiconductor factories around the country.",
      "But experts say increasing reliance on nuclear energy will be both risky and costly.",
      "Japan will need to import uranium, which is expensive and will make the country reliant on other countries, said Professor Kenichi Oshima at the faculty of policy science at Ryukoku University.",
      "Prof Oshima told the BBC the main concern is that increasing the number of nuclear power plants also raises the risk of potentially disastrous accidents.",
      "He cited the 2024 New Year's Day earthquake in the Noto peninsula, where two decades ago, a plan to build a nuclear plant was scrapped because locals opposed it.",
      "\"If there had been a nuclear power plant there, it is quite clear that it would have caused a major accident,\" he said.",
      "Fukushima looms large",
      "In Japan, any mention of nuclear energy inevitably brings back difficult memories of the nuclear meltdown at the Daiichi power plant.",
      "\"We all had such a terrible experience at the time of the Fukushima quake,\" Tokyo resident Yuko Maruyama told the BBC.",
      "\"How could I support it [the nuclear energy plan]? I want the government to rely on other sources of energy,\" she added.",
      "\"As a mother I think of the children, of their safety. I cannot help but think about what would happen in the future.\"",
      "The meltdown at Fukushima is considered the world's worst since that of Chernobyl in 1986.",
      "It stirred fresh controversy in 2023, when Japan started releasing treated water from the site of the Fukushima plant. This drew protests from Japan's neighbours, including China, over safety concerns.",
      "The United Nations atomic energy regulator IAEA said the waste water was safe and would have a \"negligible\" impact on people and the environment.",
      "In response to the new energy plan announced this week, Greenpeace said promoting nuclear energy is \"outrageous\" when the fallout from Fukushima is still ongoing.",
      "\"There is no justification for continuing to rely on nuclear energy, which remains toxic for tens of thousands of years, produces radioactive waste that requires long-term management, and carries risks like earthquakes and terrorism,\" the group said.",
      "What happened at Fukushima 12 years ago?",
      "China anger over Fukushima fuelled by disinformation",
      "China retaliates as Japan releases Fukushima water",
      "To meet the government's goal, experts say 33 reactors must be put back online, but the current pace of safety checks as well as residents' objections in some areas will make this difficult.",
      "Many of these nuclear plants are old and will need to be refitted with new technology for them to function safely.",
      "\"That most difficult problem is that each nuclear power plant is in a different location and will need its own safety protocol and infrastructure,\" Yamagiwa said.",
      "\"We must check each of them carefully. It still takes time.\"",
      "In recent months, regulators have given several old reactors approval to keep operating.",
      "In October 2024 Japan's oldest reactor, Takahama nuclear power plant, was given the go-ahead to continue operations, making it the first reactor in the country to get approval to operate beyond 50 years."

    "summary": "Peers and scholars reflect on the role Muhsin Hendricks played in the LGBTQ+ and Islamic communities.",
    "story": [
      "The execution-style killing of an openly gay imam, Muhsin Hendricks, in South Africa has left people in the LGBTQ+ community fearful for their safety - but also determined to forge ahead with the campaign to end their marginalisation in religious circles.",
      "Reverend Toni Kruger-Ayebazibwe, an openly gay Christian cleric, told the BBC that Hendricks was a \"gentle spirit\" who brought light into any room he occupied.",
      "\"The gap Muhsin leaves is massive,\" she said, adding that she knew for a fact that there were \"a large number of queer Muslims around the world who are grief stricken\".",
      "The 57-year-old was shot dead in what appeared to be a hit on Saturday in the small coastal city of Gqeberha.",
      "Initial reports that Cape Town-based Hendricks had been in Gqeberha to perform the wedding ceremony of a gay couple have been dismissed as untrue by his Al-Gurbaah Foundation.",
      "\"He was visiting Gqeberha to officiate the marriages of two interfaith heterosexual couples when he was tragically shot and killed,\" it said in a statement.",
      "It is unclear why the couples had asked Hendricks to oversee their ceremonies, but it suggests that he was pushing the boundaries, even in the last seconds of his life.",
      "Traditional imams in South Africa rarely, if ever, perform the marriage of a Muslim to a non-Muslim - something that Hendricks clearly had no issue with.",
      "He had, according to a faith leader that the BBC spoke to, conducted one such marriage ceremony and was on his way to conduct the next one when he was gunned down in his vehicle.",
      "Two leading bodies that represent imams - the Muslim Judicial Council (MJC) and the United Ulama Council of South Africa (UUCSA) - condemned Hendricks' killing.",
      "\"As members of a democratic, pluralistic society, the MJC remains steadfast in advocating for peaceful coexistence and mutual respect, even amidst divergent views,\" the MJC said, while the UUCSA said it condemned \"all forms of extra-judicial killings\".",
      "However, Hendricks - who did his Islamic studies in Pakistan - was a pariah in their circles, as they hold the view that Islam prohibits same-sex relations.",
      "They pointedly referred to him as \"Mr Hendricks\", rather than by religious titles like imam or sheikh.",
      "In contrast, Hendricks' supporters hailed him as the world's first openly gay imam who made it possible for them to reconcile their sexuality with their Islamic faith.",
      "That he was a trail-blazer is not surprising - South Africa's constitution, adopted in 1996 after the end of white-minority rule, was the first in the world to protect people from discrimination because of their sexual orientation.",
      "Then in 2006, South Africa became the first country in Africa to legalise same-sex marriage.",
      "Once in a heterosexual marriage with children, Hendricks came out as gay in 1996 - and, according to The Conversation, he later broke another taboo by marrying a Hindu man.",
      "He then spearheaded the formation of The Inner Circle as \"an underground social and support group\" for queer Muslims.",
      "It started out at his home in Cape Town, and has \"proven to be very successful in helping Muslims who are queer to reconcile Islam with their sexuality\", The Inner Circle's website says.",
      "Despite South Africa having a thriving LGBTQ+ scene, members of the community still face some stigmatisation and violence.",
      "Only a few of the country's religious groups have adopted policies that are more favourable towards the community, among them the Dutch Reformed Church and the Methodist Church of Southern Africa.",
      "The Dutch Reformed Church was in 2019 forced by the courts to reinstate a policy it had introduced four years earlier, but then scrapped, allowing same-sex marriages and for gay and lesbian pastors to be in romantic relationships.",
      "The following year, the Methodist Church said that while it was \"not yet ready to apply for its ministers to officiate at same-sex marriages\", no congregant residing in a member country that recognised civil unions would be \"prevented from entering into such a union which can be as same-sex or opposite sex couples\".",
      "Reverend Ecclesia de Lange, the director at Inclusive and Affirming Ministries (IAM), told the BBC that even in instances where faith groups had adopted inclusive policies there were still \"pockets of very strong conservatism\".",
      "\"The traditional interpretations of sacred texts continue to exclude LGBTQ+ people, so the struggle for acceptance within faith communities remains ongoing,\" she said.",
      "Senior lecturer in Islamic Studies at South Africa's University of the Western Cape, Dr Fatima Essop, reflected on the \"distressing\" vitriolic content circulating on social media in the wake of Hendricks' killing.",
      "\"I just find that completely shocking and so far removed from our... Islamic tradition, which is all about compassion and mercy and preservation of human life,\" she told the BBC.",
      "Dr Essop added that while she understood some of the strong feelings against Hendricks' work, there was \"absolutely no justification, Islamic or otherwise, for this kind of violence\".",
      "And while the motive is unclear, Hendricks' killing - and the negative comments that followed - was likely to make people fearful to \"speak about their sexuality or sexual orientation\", Dr Essop said.",
      "Reverend Kruger-Ayebazibwe said that while Hendricks' shooting would make LGBTQ+ leaders rethink their security, it would not deter them from campaigning for change \"because the work matters too much\".",
      "Hendricks has already been buried at a private ceremony, though his Al-Gurbaah Foundation has pledged to organise a memorial in the near future to \"honour his immense contributions\".",
      "For Teboho Klaas, the religion programme officer at The Other Foundation, which champions LGBTQ+ rights in southern Africa, his killers may have cut his life short \"but not his legacy because he has multiplied himself\".",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Feb 2025 22:13:55 GMT",
    "summary": "Two years after ChatGPT, China launched DeepSeek, but India doesn't have its own foundational model yet.",
    "story": [
      "Two years after ChatGPT took the world by storm, China's DeepSeek has sent ripples through the tech industry by collapsing the cost for developing generative artificial intelligence applications.",
      "But as the global race for AI supremacy heats up, India appears to have fallen behind, especially in creating its own foundational language model that's used to power things like chatbots.",
      "The government claims a homegrown equivalent to DeepSeek isn't far away. It is supplying startups, universities and researchers with thousands of high-end chips needed to develop it in under 10 months.",
      "A flurry of global AI leaders have also been talking up India's capabilities recently.",
      "After being initially dismissive, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman this month said India should be playing a leading role in the AI revolution. The country is now OpenAI's second largest market by users.",
      "Others like Microsoft have put serious money on the table \u2013 committing $3bn (\u00a32.4bn) for cloud and AI infrastructure. Nvidia's Jensen Huang also spoke of India's \"unmatched\" technical talent as a key to unlocking its future potential.",
      "With 200 startups working on generative AI, there's enough entrepreneurial activity under way too.",
      "But despite having key ingredients for success in place, India risks lagging behind without basic structural fixes to education, research and state policy, experts say.",
      "China and the US already have a \"four to five year head-start\", having invested heavily in research and academia and developed AI for military applications, law enforcement and now large language models, technology analyst Prasanto Roy told the BBC.",
      "Though in the top five globally on Stanford's AI Vibrancy Index \u2013 which ranks countries on metrics such as patents, funding, policy and research \u2013 India is still far behind the two superpowers in many key areas.",
      "China and the US were granted 60% and 20% of the world's total AI patents between 2010 and 2022 respectively. India got less than half a percent.",
      "India's AI startups also received a fraction of the private investment that US and Chinese companies got in 2023.",
      "India's state-funded AI mission, meanwhile, is worth a trifling $1bn compared with the staggering $500bn the US has earmarked for Stargate - a plan to build massive AI infrastructure in the US - or China's reported $137bn initiative to become an AI hub by 2030.",
      "While DeepSeek's success has demonstrated that AI models can be built on older, less expensive chips - something India can take solace from - lack of \"patient\" or long-term capital from either industry or government is a major problem, says Jaspreet Bindra, founder of a consultancy that builds AI literacy in organisations.",
      "\"Despite what has been heard about DeepSeek developing a model with $5.6m, there was much more capital behind it.\"",
      "Lack of high-quality India-specific datasets required for training AI models in regional languages such as Hindi, Marathi or Tamil is another problem, especially given India's language diversity.",
      "But for all its issues, India punches far above its weight on talent \u2013 with 15% of the world's AI workers coming from the country.",
      "The issue though, as Stanford's AI talent migration research shows, is that more and more of them are choosing to leave the country.",
      "This is partly because \"foundational AI innovations typically come from deep R&D in universities and corporate research labs\", Mr Bindra says.",
      "And India lacks a supporting research environment, with few deep-tech breakthroughs emerging from its academic and corporate sectors.",
      "The enormous success of India's payments revolution was due to strong government-industry-academia collaboration - a similar model, he says, needs to be replicated for the AI push.",
      "The Unified Payment Interface (UPI), a digital payment system developed by a government organisation, has revolutionised digital payments in India, allowing millions to transact at the click of a button or by scanning a QR code.",
      "DeepSeek: The Chinese AI app that has the world talking",
      "AI chatbots unable to accurately summarise news, BBC finds",
      "Indian media pile into lawsuit against OpenAI chatbot ChatGPT",
      "Bengaluru's $200bn outsourcing industry, home to millions of coders, should have ideally been at the forefront of India's AI ambitions. But the IT companies have never really shifted their focus from cheap service-based work to developing foundational consumer AI technologies.",
      "\"It's a huge gap which they left to the startups to fill,\" says Mr Roy.",
      "He's unsure though whether startups and government missions can do this heavy lifting quickly enough, adding that the 10-month timeline set by the minster was a knee-jerk reaction to DeepSeek's sudden emergence.",
      "\"I don't think India will be able to produce anything like DeepSeek at least for the next few years,\" he adds. It is a view many others share.",
      "India can, however, continue to build and tweak applications upon existing open source platforms like DeepSeek \"to leapfrog our own AI progress\", Bhavish Agarwal, founder of one of India's earliest AI startups Krutrim, recently wrote on X.",
      "In the longer run though, developing a foundational model will be critical to have strategic autonomy in the sector and reduce import dependencies and threats of sanctions, say experts.",
      "India will also need to increase its computational power or hardware infrastructure to run such models, which means manufacturing semiconductors - something that's not taken off yet.",
      "Much of this will need to fall in place before the gap with the US and China is narrowed meaningfully."

      "Jurors had deliberated for just about three hours before reaching the verdict.",
      "Prosecutors had alleged Rocky shot twice in the direction of his former friend, Terell Ephron, near a Hollywood hotel in 2021. Ephron, another former member of the hip hop collective A$AP Mob who previously went by A$AP Relli, has said he was left with bullet-graze wounds above his knuckles. He testified that Rocky had allegedly threatened to kill him the same night.",
      "The defense accused Ephron of fabricating evidence, committing perjury and attempting to extort Rocky, saying the rapper had a prop gun that only fired blanks which he carried around for security.",
      "Rocky pleaded not guilty to both counts and maintained his innocence through statements by his attorneys.",
      "Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman released a statement on behalf of the prosecution after Tuesday's verdict.",
      "\"While today's verdict is not the outcome we sought, we respect the jury's decision and the integrity of our justice system,\" Hochman said in the statement. \"Our office remains committed to seeking accountability for those who break the law, no matter their status or influence. Fame does not place anyone above the law, and we will not waver in our pursuit of justice for victims and the community.\"",
      "As closing arguments got underway late last week, Rihanna appeared inside the downtown LA courtroom with the couple's 2-year-old and 1-year-old sons with her for the first time, the\u00a0Associated Press reported.",
      "A$AP Rocky stands trial in Los Angeles",
      "Prosecutors alleged Rocky pointed a semiautomatic firearm at Ephron before opening fire during another later confrontation on the evening of Nov. 6, 2021. During the first few days of the trial, Ephron testified that Rocky said, \"I'll kill you right now,\" as he pointed the gun at him, saying it was pointed \"like towards my stomach, like towards like my head and shoulder.\"",
      "While he said he couldn't remember certain details, he told jurors Rocky had moved the gun as he pointed it, saying \"He was looking for a spot to shoot me.\" The prosecution had claimed Rocky then opened fire twice in Ephron's direction later that night, during another alleged confrontation which Ephron described during his testimony.",
      "\"So I see Rocky turn around, and when he turned around, he's like,\" Ephron said as he mimicked the gesture he says Rocky made with the gun, raising his arm into the air while pointing his fingers downward. \"Kinda looked like a movie. The whole thing looked like a movie.\"",
      "The former friends were near the intersection of Argyle and Selma avenues, an area of Hollywood just around the corner from the Walk of Fame, when prosecutors say Rocky opened fire.",
      "Ephron testified he was left with bullet-graze wounds just above his knuckles which he later sought medical treatment for.",
      "\"When he shot the first shot, I felt my hand hot,\" he told jurors from the witness stand last month, saying he grabbed another person there that night and \"used him as a shield\" to try dodging the gunfire. \"I'm just trying to like not get hit at this point,\" Ephron said.",
      "He testified he went back to the area later that night, after Los Angeles Police Department officers had responded to the scene, and collected shell casings he claims were fired by the gun. \"But I ended up going back and getting the actual bullets myself,\" he said, saying he brought a paper bag to collect them and took photos of them.",
      "\"It wasn't hard for me to find the bullets because I knew exactly where I got shot at,\" he said.",
      "Tacopina, Rocky's defense attorney, told jurors that Ephron fabricated that evidence and committed perjury during his testimony, describing him as a \"pathological liar\" during the trial. Tacopina said several police officers had responded to the scene before Ephron returned, saying they carried out a thorough search and never came across shell casings.",
      "\"What you'll learn is that Relli returned to that scene an hour later,\" Tacopina said of Ephron, referring to him by his former artist name of A$AP Relli. \"And he attempted to fabricate evidence... This is some offensive stuff.\"",
      "One of the defense witnesses testified to seeing Rocky with a starter pistol, which only fired blanks, on three occasions. A$AP Twelvyy, another former member of the A$AP Mob collective and longtime friend of Rocky, said the rapper carried around the fake gun as a means of security. The felony charges Rocky had faced do not apply if there was no real firearm involved.",
      "The defense argued the rapper could also be found not guilty on the basis of self defense. Both the prosecution and defense has agreed that Rocky and two other men who were with him that night walked away after the first of two confrontations in Hollywood on the night of Nov. 6, 2021, and that Relli followed them afterwards. However, prosecutors argued Rocky was the aggressor when he first allegedly pulled out the gun and then allegedly opened fire during the second incident.",
      "While arguing that Ephron attempted to extort Rocky, the defense presented recordings which a witness for the defense, Wally Sajimi, testified he made in 2022. On the recording, a voice resembling Ephron's says he will accept being paid to stop taking part in the case against Rocky. \"Once I walk away, when I get my cash, the case will get way weaker,\" the voice on the recording says.",
      "But prosecutors have said Ephron's testimony in court was consistent with what he told Sajimi during a recorded conversation \u2014 that the Grammy-nominated rapper had opened fire with a real gun.",
      "\"Mr. Ephron wants to be paid because he was the victim of a real crime by a real gun,\" Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Paul Przelomiec told jurors last week. \"In that couple minutes, he tells the exact same details that he told you when he testified in this case.\"",
      "\"That's evidence they created. That's their person trying to trick Mr. Ephron, trying to get Mr. Ephron to say something damaging, say something that's gonna undermine this case,\" Przelomiec said of the recording submitted as evidence by the defense.",
      "During closing arguments, Przelomiec told jurors that witnesses who testified for the defense never told law enforcement that Rocky had a fake gun that night when the investigation first got underway. He said the prop gun was only brought up more than two years after the alleged shooting, when those witnesses spoke with Rocky's defense attorneys.",
      "\"The idea that they would not be running into the police station to tell their story is absurd,\" Przelomiec said of the defense witnesses.",
      "Meanwhile, the defense has honed in on what they allege is a lack of credibility in the prosecution's key witness.",
      "Tacopina told jurors during closing arguments last week that aside from Ephron's testimony, the prosecution's evidence \"consists of video, shell casings and knuckle scrapes,\" saying the videos alone do not prove the defendant's guilt and the shell casings were fabricated evidence.",
      "\"They mean nothing without believing his story,\" Tacopina said.",

    "story": [
      "A painting by street artist Banksy with an environmental message and an estimate of up to 5 million pounds ($6.3 million) is going up for auction, with some of the proceeds helping victims of the Los Angeles wildfires.",
      "Sotheby's auction house said Tuesday that \"Crude Oil (Vettriano)\" is being sold by Sotheby's in London on March 4 from the collection of Mark Hoppus, bassist with California skate-punk band Blink-182, who sees Banksy as a kindred spirit.",
      "Hoppus said he was drawn to the subversion, humor and intelligence of Banksy's work and the similarities between \"skateboarding, punk rock and art.\"",
      "\"I feel like street art and punk rock have the same core,\" Hoppus said. \"The left-out and overlooked making their own reality. \u2026 Just go make art. It's the same spirit. And I've loved art and especially street art ever since realizing that.\"",
      "\"Crude Oil (Vettriano)\" is part of a 2005 series of works in which Banksy put a satirical spin on famous paintings \u2014 withering Vincent van Gogh's \"Sunflowers\" and smashing the diner window in Edward Hopper's \"Nighthawks.\" The artist said his aim was to show that \"the real damage done to our environment is not done by graffiti writers and drunken teenagers, but by big business.\"",
      "The work going under the hammer is based on \"The Singing Butler,\" a painting by Scottish artist Jack Vettriano showing a couple in evening dress dancing on a beach as servants proffer sheltering umbrellas. Banksy has added a sinking oil liner and two figures lugging a barrel of toxic waste.",
      "\"We loved this painting since the moment we saw it,\" said Hoppus, who bought the artwork with his wife Skye in 2011. He said the painting \u2013 \"unmistakably Banksy, but different\" \u2013 has hung in the family's homes in London and LA ever since.",
      "Hoppus said he would use the proceeds of the sale to buy work by upcoming artists. Some will go to the California Fire Foundation, Children's Hospital Los Angeles and Cedars Sinai Hematology Oncology Research,",

The record is almost 18.6 million pounds ($25.4 million at the time) paid at Sotheby's in October 2021 for \"Love is in the Bin\" \u2013 an image of a girl with a balloon that partially self-destructed during an auction three years earlier thanks to a shredder hidden in the frame.",

A few of the images were likely created using image stitching tools that do not involve AI, according to Reality Defender's analysis.",
      "\"Almost all deepfake pornography does not have the consent of the subject being deepfaked,\" Ben Colman, co-founder and CEO of Reality Defender told CBS News on Sunday. \"Such content is growing at a dizzying rate, especially as existing measures to stop such content are seldom implemented.\"",

The company also bans adult nudity, sexual activity and adult sexual exploitation, and its regulations are intended to block users from sharing or threatening to share non-consensual intimate imagery. Meta has also rolled out the use of \"AI info\" labels to clearly mark content that is AI manipulated.",
      "But questions remain over the effectiveness of the tech company's policing of such content.

      "Meta's Oversight Board, a quasi-independent body that consists of experts in the field of human rights and freedom of speech, and makes recommendations for content moderation on Meta's platforms, told CBS News in an emailed statement that the company's current regulations around sexualized deepfake content are insufficient.",
      "The Oversight Board cited recommendations it has made to Meta over the past year,\u00a0 including urging the company to make its rules clearer by updating its prohibition against \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" to specifically include the word \"non-consensual\" and to encompass other photo manipulation techniques such as AI.",
      "The board has also recommended that Meta fold its ban on \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" into the company's Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations, so moderation of such content would be more rigorously enforced.",
      "Asked Monday by CBS News about the board's recommendations, Meta pointed to the guidelines on its transparency website, which show the company is assessing the feasibility of three of four recommendations from the oversight board and is implementing one of its suggestions, though Meta noted in its statement on its site that it is currently ruling out changing the language of its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to include the phrase \"non consensual.\" Meta also says it is currently unlikely   to move its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to within its Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations.",
      "Meta noted in its statement that it was still considering ways to signal a lack of consent in AI-generated images. Meta also said it was considering reforms to its Adult Sexual Exploitation policies, to \"capture the spirit\" of the board's recommendations.",
      "\"The Oversight Board has made clear that non-consensual deepfake intimate images are a serious violation of privacy and personal dignity, disproportionately harming women and girls. These images are not just a misuse of technology \u2014 they are a form of abuse that can have lasting consequences,\" Michael McConnell, an Oversight Board co-chair, told CBS News on Friday.",
      "\"The Board is actively monitoring Meta's response and will continue to push for stronger safeguards, faster enforcement, and greater accountability,\" McConnell said.",

      "Paul Simon and Sabrina Carpenter duetted on Simon's \"Homeward Bound\" to open the show, five-decade \"Saturday Night Live\" luminary Steve Martin delivered the monologue, and Paul McCartney gave an epic closing to a 50th anniversary special celebrating the sketch institution that was overflowing with famous former cast members, superstar hosts and legendary guests.",
      "The 83-year-old Simon has been essential to \"SNL\" since its earliest episodes in 1975, and told the 25-year-old pop sensation of the moment Carpenter that he first performed \"Homeward Bound\" on \"SNL\" in 1976.",
      "\"I was not born then,\" Carpenter said, getting a laugh. \"And neither were my parents,\" she added, getting a bigger laugh.",

      "Lil Wayne and Miley Cyrus were among the night's other musical guests, though the show's musical legacy also had its own night with a Radio City Music Hall concert on Friday.",
      "\"SNL50: The Anniversary Celebration\" aired live from New York, of course, on NBC and Peacock. The pop culture juggernaut has launched the careers of generations of comedians including Eddie Murphy, Kristen Wiig and Will Ferrell, who all appeared in early sketches.",
      "And the evening included epic cameos that included Meryl Streep, Jack Nicholson and Keith Richards.",
      "Martin, one of the shows most prolific hosts and guests since the first season in 1975, tried to keep it current in the monologue even on a backward-looking night.",
      "Martin said when the show's creator Lorne Michaels only told him he'd be doing the monologue, \"I was actually vacationing on a friend's boat down on the Gulf of Steve Martin.\"",
      "He was joined by former \"SNL\" luminaries and frequent hosts Martin Short and John Mulaney, who looked at the star-studded crowd full of former hosts in the same Studio 8H at 30 Rockefeller Plaza that has been the show's longtime home.",
      "\"I see some of the most difficult people I have ever met in my entire life,\" Mulaney said. \"Over the course of 50 years, 894 people have hosted 'Saturday Night Live,' and it amazes me that only two of them have committed murder.\"",
      "Later, on the night's \"Weekend Update,\" anchor Colin Jost said there are so many former hosts and musical guests that wanted to see the show that many had to be seated in a neighboring studio and some had to watch \"from the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn\" as a photo of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs appeared.",
      "Martin took a jab at the always-difficult-to-wrangle Bill Murray in his monologue.",
      "\"We wanted to make sure that Bill would be here tonight,\" Martin said, \"so we didn't invite him.\"",
      "Murray appeared on \"Weekend Update\" to rank the show's anchors since they began with Chevy Chase. He poked at the whiteness of the group by first ranking its Black anchors, a list of just one, current co-anchor Michael Che.",
      "The extravaganza came after months of celebrations of \"Saturday Night Live,\" which premiered Oct. 11, 1975, with an original cast that included John Belushi, Chase and Gilda Radner.",
      "It's become appointment television over the years as the show has skewered presidents, politics and pop culture.",
      "\"It is a honor and a thrill to be hosting weekend update for the 50th and if it was up to our president final season of SNL,\" Jost said.",
      "The show had its typical ending, with all involved looking exhilarated and exhausted on the studio stage. This night it was so crowded with luminaries it looked like it might break. Led by Short, they all applauded in tribute to Michaels, who created the show and has run it for 45 of its 50 years.",
      "Alec Baldwin, the show's most frequent host with 17 stints, appeared to introduce an evening of commercial parodies, seven months after his trial was halted and an involuntary manslaughter charge was dropped in the shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.",
      "Aubrey Plaza made one of her first public appearances since the January death of her husband when she introduced Cyrus and Howard's performance.",
      "The 87-year-old Nicholson was once a constant in the front rows of the Oscars and Los Angeles Laker games, but is rarely seen out anymore. He introduced his \"Anger Management\" co-star Adam Sandler, who sang in his signature style about the show's history. He gave a roll-call of cast members, giving special attention to several who have died, including his friends Chris Farley and MacDonald along with Radner, Jan Hooks and Phil Hartman.",
      "It ended with, \"six years of our boy Farley, five of our buddy Norm.\"",
      "The show didn't have a formal \"in memoriam\" section, though it pretended to when 10-time host Tom Hanks came out somberly to mourn \"SNL characters and sketches that have aged horribly.\"",
      "A montage began with the late Belushi's \"Samurai\" character. The word \"Yikes\" appeared on screen in a sketch that included Mike Myers and a young Macaulay Culkin in a bathtub. A \"body shaming\" label appeared over the beloved sketch of Farley and the late Patrick Swayze as Chippendale's dancers, and \"slut shaming\" appeared over one of the show's earliest, catchphrases, Dan Aykroyd saying \"Jane, you ignorant slut\" to Jane Curtin. The current-day Aykroyd was a notable absence.",
      "The oldest former cast member, 88-year-old Garrett Morris, appeared to introduce a film that showed the whole original cast.",
      "\"I had no idea y'all that I would be required to do so many reunion shows,\" he said.",
      "The first sketch featured a mash-up of former cast members and hosts. Fred Armisen hosted a \"Lawrence Welk Show\" that featured Ferrell as Robert Goulet.",
      "Former hosts Kim Kardashian and Scarlett Johansson - Jost's wife - gave an updated version of the elegant singing Maharelle Sisters with former cast members Ana Gasteyer and Wiig, who provided the traditional punchline \"And I'm Dooneese\" with a balding head and creepy, tiny doll arms.",
      "It was followed by \"Black Jeopardy,\" hosted by the show's longest running (and still current) cast member, Kenan Thompson, who called the game show the only one \"where every single viewer fully understood Kendrick's halftime performance.\"",
      "It showcased many of the show's most prominent Black cast members through the years including Tracy Morgan and Murphy, doing a Morgan impression.",
      "\"Big Dog gonna make some big money!\" Murphy-as-Morgan shouted.",
      "Streep walked on as the mother of McKinnon's constant alien abductee Miss Rafferty, with the same spread legs and vulgar manner.",
      "Streep's fellow all-time-great actor Robert De Niro paired with Rachel Dratch in a \"Debbie Downer\" sketch with its traditional trombone accompaniment.",

      "Whether the company's prior agreement with Paramount, which allowed it to stream a broad range of channels under the network's umbrella, would hold up for another year was uncertain until Saturday, as a dispute over carriage fees halted talks for a contract renewal.",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 11:37:22 -0500",
    "summary": "The actor, who received his fourth Oscar nomination for his portrayal of the legendary folk singer, talks about cultivating authenticity in his performances.",
    "story": [
      "The fires that ravaged Southern California last month turned too many of Malibu's most treasured places to ash. But some, like the legendary Shangri-La Studios, still stand. Over the years, Shangri-La has been used by some of the biggest names in the music business, like Eric Clapton and Adele. But it's also known as the house that Bob Dylan built. Even the old bus out back, legend has it, was used by Dylan on tour.",
      "Dylan even camped out on the lawn. \"I actually think it's in Clapton's biography that there was a period where Dylan had a tent in the rose garden here,\" said actor Edward Norton.",
      "For him, this is hallowed ground \u2013 and in a way, so is his latest movie role. In \"A Complete Unknown,\" Norton is folk music legend Pete Seeger, playing opposite Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as the young Bob Dylan.",
      "Norton says playing a music legend like Seeger was both sublime, and terrifying. \"I think every actor, some part of 'em wants to be a rock star, you know?\" he said. \"I think every actor holds the dream in some sense. I mean, I almost started crying at the idea of it, because, well, I was nervous about it. I was nervous about the whole enterprise. Because I thought the idea of a biopic about Dylan \u2013 if you just said it that way, I was, like, Oooh, like, I'm not sure. 'Cause to me, it has a mythical kind of place in me, and I thought, this could be really, really a bad idea.\"",
      "And here's just one of the challenges: Pete Seeger was an accomplished banjo player, so Norton had to become one as well, and the banjo's a tough one to learn.",
      "I said, \"We did an interview with Steve Martin, and he played the banjo for us, and watching him play the banjo, I mean, it's so complex and it's so fast.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I made the joke that I googled, you know, 'Is there an AI that can replace my hands with Steve Martin's?'\" Norton laughed. \"Or, you know, that thing where you put your arms behind your back and Steve Martin puts his hands under my armpits and does the playing for me? Which I'm not saying is not what happened, you know? It might have. Who knows?\"",
      "In the finished film, his playing looks and sounds authentic, because it is:",
      "That authenticity is something that Norton has always worked for, starting with his very first movie role, as a calculating killer in the 1996 thriller \"Primal Fear.\" Norton, who was raised in Maryland, cultivated an Appalachian accent so real that people thought he was actually from Kentucky, and he wound up with his first Oscar nomination. Three years later he was fighting it out with Brad Pitt in \"Fight Club,\" a film that has now become embedded in our culture.",
      "And although it has a huge following now, it was not successful when it was released. \"No, not at all,\" Norton said. \"And it was polarizing. I would say, there were those who absolutely, like, it hit them right in the center of their sense of their own selves. And then there were people who just absolutely thought it was garbage \u2013 panned it.\"",
      "In fact, it was roundly booed at the Venice Film Festival. But that didn't bother Norton, or his co-star Pitt. \"As the credits rolled, Brad looked at me in the dark crying, and he said, 'That's the best film we'll ever be in.' And I said, 'Me, too, and I think so, too.' And we were hugging each other and crying because we were so happy with, like, boos rising around us, you know what I mean? I think sometimes you just gotta, you know, let your own freak flag fly, and people will figure it out, or not.\"",
      "Norton has let his own freak flag fly in more than 40 films, like a mild-mannered police captain in \"The Grand Budapest Hotel.\" He was an ego-driven Broadway actor in \"Birdman\"; and he nailed the eccentric billionaire part in \"Glass Onion.\"",
      "Watching him on-screen, it's hard to believe Norton was once told he didn't have what it takes to make it as an actor. There was once a casting director who told him, \"Find another profession.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I had one of those, like, someone sits you down and says, 'You should do something else,'\" he said. \"Very, very, very well-known casting director in New York. One of the ones you hoped to get in front of. But look, if you don't run into moments where people lay some fundamental uncertainty around you [about] the path you've chosen, and you can't push through it, then you probably don't belong.\"",
      "There's little doubt he belongs in all of this: Norton has an Oscar nomination for every decade of his career, and he's in the running now for his work in \"A Complete Unknown.\" But he says that, for him, it's not about the awards or the money, but the chance to channel greatness.",
      "He said, \"If channeling their frequency gets people refocused on what it looked like when people were using the talents they had to further ideas and values that were bigger than themselves, then that is what makes it worth doing. Can we get people to re-engage with and be moved by and inspired by the idea of artists as agents of change?\"",
      "And whether Edward Norton is a pure artist, or just a really great actor, it's easy to believe him.",

      "\"Lorne: The Man Who Invented Saturday Night Live,\"\u00a0by New Yorker articles editor Susan Morrison (to be published February 18 by Random House), is a biography of late-night comedy producer Lorne Michaels, who has guided \"Saturday Night Live\" for most of its 50 years. But it is also the history of a pop culture institution that has introduced phenomenal comic talents, rewritten the rules of live television, and captured or challenged the zeitgeist for a half-century.",

      "Prologue",
      "Every week at Saturday Night Live is just like every other week. Every week is the same because it's always intense, fueled by insanely hard work, full of triumphs and failures and backstage explosions, and because it's built around a guest host\u2014Jennifer Lopez or Lizzo or Elon Musk\u2014who often has no idea what they are doing. It has been Lorne Michaels's job for the last fifty years to make it seem as if they do, and to corral the egos and the talents on his staff into getting the show on the air, live. Since he created the show, in 1975, he has periodically tweaked and fine-tuned it, paying attention to how the cultural winds are drifting. But the formula has essentially remained the same. Michaels compares it to a Snickers bar: viewers expect a certain amount of peanuts, a certain amount of caramel, and a certain amount of chocolate. (\"There's a comfort level,\" he says.) The show has good years and bad years, like the New York Yankees, or the Dow, and the audience has come to feel something like ownership of it. Just about every person who has ever watched SNL believes that its funniest years were the ones when they were in high school. Michaels likes to say that everyone in the entertainment business has two jobs: their actual job and figuring out how to fix SNL. (When J. D. Salinger died, in 2010, letters surfaced in which even he griped about what was wrong with the show.)",
      "The show's cast members and writers have speculated for years about the secret behind Michaels's extraordinary tenure. \"It's him and Hitchcock,\" John Mulaney says. \"No one else has had this kind of longevity.\" Half of them believe that Michaels has repeatedly been able to remake the show for a new audience because he's a once-in-a-lifetime talent, a producer nonpareil. The other half wonders whether Michaels, gnomic and almost comically elusive, is a blank screen onto which they've all projected a lifetime of hopes and fears and dark jokes; whether he, like the cramped stages in SNL's Studio 8H, is just a backdrop for the ever-shifting brilliance of the country's best comic minds.",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 10:14:56 -0500",
    "summary": "On October 11, 1975, people tuning into the debut of a late-night comedy show saw something unlike any TV variety extravaganza they'd ever seen. Today, \"Saturday Night Live,\" produced by Lorne Michaels, is now an entrenched part of pop culture.",
    "story": [
      "On Saturday night, October 11, 1975, television viewers tuned in for a comedy variety show that looked nothing like they were used to. \"It's a sketch, a very unusual sketch, kind of in a minor key, [with] John Belushi as a kind of rumpled guy with a grocery sack,\" said writer Susan Morrison. \"He's supposed to be an immigrant trying to learn English.\"",
      "Instructor (Michael O'Donoghue): \"I would like\u2026\"Belushi: \"I would like\u2026\"Instructor: \"\u2026to feed your fingertips\u2026\"Belushi: \"\u2026to feed your fingertips\u2026\"Instructor: \"\u2026to the wolverines.\"Belushi: \"\u2026to the wolverines.\"",
      "When the instructor succumbs to a heart attack and falls to the floor, Belushi mimics him. \"It's about death,\" Morrison laughed. \"And that was something that variety shows did not traffic in in 1975!\"",
      "Morrison is the author of \"Lorne\" (that would be Lorne Michaels, the man behind \"Saturday Night Live\"). For 50 years now, \"Saturday Night Live\" has been putting on a 90-minute mix of live comedy sketches, beloved commercial parodies, and musical acts, each episode headlined by a celebrity host.",
      "So, what did variety shows look like before SNL? \"They took place on a big, wide stage; it was very shiny, very blank,\" said Morrison. \"And the content of these variety shows also was kind of a throwback \u2013 very hammy, almost vaudevillian, kind of Catskill comics doing seltzer-in-the-pants bits.\"",
      "Michaels worked on several of those shows, including \"Laugh-In.\" Morrison said, \"'Laugh-In' was really the first variety show that seemed to care about youth culture and being hip. But politically, that show was relatively toothless. What passed for political humor on 'Laugh-In' was Goldie Hawn doing kind of a dumb blonde bit.\"",
      "Michaels learned a different lesson working on a cornball comedy show hosted by Phyllis Diller.\u00a0 Its premiere episode in 1968 went up against a Barbra Streisand special. \"Streisand was the hottest thing out there,\" said Morrison. \"'Funny Girl' was about to come out. And Lorne thought, 'Oh my God, we're dead. Everybody's gonna watch Streisand.' But as it turned out, the Diller show beat Streisand in the ratings by a mile.",
      "\"And Lorne recognized, I think he said, 'You know, I realized there are two audiences. You know, there's the people I know, and then there's the wider American audience.' And to this day, he's always telling his young writers and performers, 'We have audience in all 50 states. We have to remember this is broadcast. It takes in the whole country.'\"",
      "Keeping all this in mind, Michaels set about creating a show for his own generation. As it happened, NBC's then-president was thinking along the same lines. And while it's fun to knock network executives, one of the revelations in \"Lorne\" is the role that Herb Schlosser played.",
      "\"He was a visionary president of NBC who was looking to fill a hole on Saturday night, when the network had been running Johnny Carson reruns,\" said Morrison. \"And he dictated a memo that pretty much hit all the points of what SNL was to be. He wanted to do a show out of Studio 8H at 30 Rock, which had basically been dormant, you know, since the '50s. He wanted it to be live. He wanted it to be on at 11:30 Saturday night. He wanted it to have rotating hosts.\"",
      "Before Michaels even hired his cast, he hired the writers, among them, Alan Zweibel. \"If you look at those early days of SNL, the logo for the show was 'Saturday Night Live' spray-painted on the outside wall of what was then called the RCA Building,\" he said. \"It was like graffiti. And I thought it spoke volumes. Here these kids came along besmirching whatever the standard was, whatever the establishment was.\"",
      "Zweibel had been working in a deli when he got the gig: \"I gave him a book with my jokes in it. The first joke that I put, saying that the post office is about to issue a stamp commemorating prostitution in the United States. 'It's a 10-cent stamp. But if you want to lick it, it's a quarter.' And they laughed, and it was great. I was now a professional comedy writer.\"",
      "The writers were young, and the cast were unknowns. Morrison said, \"He really wanted the show to feel like it was speaking in the voice of everybody's funny, sarcastic friend, you know, grousing, wisecracking, just the way people are when they're trying to make their friends laugh.\"",
      "And over the past five decades, America has become friends with more than a hundred different cast members and the characters they've created, not to mention all those catchphrases that have seeped into our conversation, like \"Well, isn't that special,\" or \"I gotta have more cowbell.\"",
      "The writers and actors know that the best way to make the audience laugh is to make each other laugh.",
      "Rachel Dratch was on the show from 1999 to 2006. She and longtime writer Paula Pell created Debbie Downer \u2013 that friend we all have who always manages to bring the party down.",
      "Dratch recalled, \"I think it was Paula said, like, 'Let's set it somewhere really happy. So, let's put it at Disney World.' And then it started to flow. And then as we were writing we were making each other laugh a lot, but then we started going, like, wah-wah. Like, just to each other. I think it was Paula who said, like, 'What if we just put the trombone in the scene?'\"",
      "Pell said, \"And then we did it for that first time, and it was where everyone lost their minds laughing on \u2013 they were wiping their eyes with waffles. And I remember being in a dressing room watching it on the thing, and just tears coming down my d\u00e9colletage and laughing so ungodly hard. It was such a lightning-in-a-bottle moment at that show where you're, like, I will never forget this five minutes ever in my life!\"",
      "For material, the staff is encouraged to draw from their own lives. \"I was always, always wanting to be a cheerleader,\" said Pell. \"And every year, every summer, I worked on my back handsprings. I was a little chubby girl. I was very strong. I was nice and loud. I was really good at cheerleading. And every year, I didn't get it.\"",
      "So, Pell collaborated with Cheri Oteri and Will Ferrell on their Spartan cheerleaders sketch:",
      "\"So, the Spartan cheerleaders, that comes from a real place?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, it comes from the place of, like, joyful loser existence,\" said Pell. \"You go, 'Oh, I didn't make it. Let's go cheer anyway. We're gonna get costumes. Let's go cheer for things nobody is gonna kick us out on,' and they still get to be dramatic cheerleaders.\"",
      "Over the run of the show, the tone of SNL has shifted away from gritty and dark, towards colorful and more, well, cheerful. Morrison writes that Lorne Michaels began directing his staff to \"do it in sunshine.\" She explained: \"Do it in sunshine means first of all, everyone should look pretty good, you know? You want the costumes to be flattering, the colors to be bright. You don't want anger. He very often counsels writers to avoid writing anger. People don't put on a television to see people yelling at each other. Fred Armisen told me that Lorne said once, 'There's enough misery in the world. People huddle around the television as if they're huddling around a fire.'\"",
      "Armisen played Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi. \"I try to keep it, you know, even with the dictators I've played, I've even approached them with \u2013 I can't believe I'm saying this \u2013 like, love and kindness. So, for Qaddafi I'm like, 'I'm gonna love this character. Whoever this guy is, I'm gonna love him and just imagine him as an eccentric at his very worst.'\"",
      "Armisen spent 12 seasons on \"Saturday Night Live.\" To hear him tell it, it wasn't nearly enough. \"I loved it. It was just the best existence,\" he said. \"If you're sitting out three sketches in a row and you're like, 'Oh, I'm not in these,' it is awesome to watch your castmates put something together and see that magic happen. It's fantastic.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 09:26:15 -0500",
    "summary": "The author has spent more than 50 years finding ways to explain things, via his humorous and intricately illustrated books featuring wooly mammoth guides \u2013 his attempt to hook young readers on the wonders right before their eyes.",
    "story": [
      "Confession: I'm just mad about the mammoth, the one that wandered out of the Ice Age into one of author-illustrator David Macaulay's books \u2013 where he found his purpose in life (if that's a mammoth thing) helping Macaulay explain the way things work to kids.",
      "\"I was desperate to find a humorous way of explaining levers,\" said Macaulay, who realized levers have probably been around for a long time. \"So, I put the mammoth on the end of the log, and put the log on the rock to have a fulcrum, and the villagers on this end of the lever. The problem that had to be solved was, what does the mammoth weigh? So, it's as simple as that!\"",
      "Since it came out in 1988, \"The Way Things Work\" has sold more than a million copies around the world. Mammoth (and a whole herd of his friends) have made their way into other Macaulay books as well.",
      "Asked how many mammoths he thinks he's drawn, Macaulay replied, \"It's like 43,272, I believe. That's just a guess.\"",
      "With or without the help of mammoths, but always with a sense of humor, Macaulay has come to be known as \"America's Explainer-in-chief.\" He is a multi-award-winning star in the children's picture book world and a Macarthur \"genius grant\" recipient, having explained all kinds of things in more than two dozen books over the course of his 50+ year career: the human body \u2026 cathedrals \u2026 castles \u2026 toilets \u2026 the pyramids \u2026 ships \u2026 the city of Rome.",
      "\"I miss Rome,\" he said. \"I think about it often, and I think about particular streets and places in Rome.\"",
      "As an architecture student at the Rhode Island School of Design, Macaulay spent a year there. Born in England, he moved to the United States at the age of ten with his family.",
      "An ongoing exhibit at the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C., explores the messiness of creating a book. It is toplined, literally, as chaos: \"Chaos, that's where this process started, and in fact it's where all my books start,\" he said. \"This whole thing [depicts] the inside of my brain, and those clouds floating overhead were an attempt to sort of suggest some of that, you know, the things that go through your mind when you think, This is not going to work.\"",
      "\"Some of these look like procrastination,\" I said.",
      "\"Oh, procrastination is my gift,\" said Macaulay. \"I always find that in the end, if I'm using my imagination, if I'm asking the right questions, then the procrastination is working in my favor. I just have to keep drawing.\"",
      "And drawing \u2026 and drawing. The exhibits features just some of the drawings he produced while he was figuring out who would be the ideal tour guide of Rome with the perfect point of view. \"Why not a pigeon carrying a message from somebody who lives outside the city to someone who lives inside the city? And it took the scenic route, which was ideal.\"",
      "Early one fall morning, Macaulay brought us to the Ledyard Bridge. On one aside, Vermont; over there, New Hampshire, the Connecticut River in-between. He began sketching the bridge: \"The weight of all of this is supported on this arch, and transferred into these piers,\" he said.",
      "He wanted us to realize that, for him, sketching is seeing. Sketching is a language for understanding. \"We look at things, but do we actually see them?\" he said. \"What better way to spend time with a structure like this than with a sketchbook in your hand, looking at specific details? I think that's my goal in a way, is to have people open their eyes to the ordinary, to the everyday, to the things they take for granted.\"",
      "Like the sorts of things, both man-made and natural, that Macaulay sees when he walks his dogs, Maya and Minnow, in Norwich, Vt., where he lives.",
      "His storyboard details the objects that hold his fascination: \"Once she's stopped and I'm holding the leash, I think, 'I wonder how many pieces of wood are in that fence? Wonder how it's fastened together?'\"",
      "Walks with Stella, his beloved previous dog, are the basis for the book he's working on now. What's starting to take shape on his wall is David Macaulay's stealth attempt to hook kids on the wonder right before their eyes.\u00a0 \"I thought maybe I can create a book that will help them connect,\" he said. \"What better way to do that than to maybe use myself as an example?\"",
      "It's the first time his work has ever been this personal and introspective. At 78, this time, the point of view is his own.",
      "But why? And why now? \"My sort of conscience, perhaps a little bit, a little payback here after all these years of being able to do what I want, really, and be successful at it, be rewarded for it,\" he said. \"It's time to maybe pay that off.\"",

    "summary": "The new Frosty flavor will be available at Wendy's locations beginning in late February.",
    "story": [
      "Wendy's Frosty's is a beloved treat \u2014 and a new addition to the lineup will combine the familiar frozen dairy dessert with a beloved Girl Scout cookie.",
      "Frosty's have been a staple of the Wendy's menu since the late 1960s when founder Dave Thomas decided to add a frozen treat to it. The drink has only grown in popularity. Last year, the chain served 500 per minute in the United States. The Frosty falls somewhere between soft serve and hard-packed ice cream, creating a frozen creamy treat that's stood the test of time.",
      "For decades, just one flavor \u2014 chocolate \u2014 was available. In 2006, vanilla joined the lineup. In 2022, the fast-food chain started trying new limited-edition flavors.",
      "On Feb. 21, the fast food chain will start selling Thin Mint-flavored Frostys. Fans are excited about the idea, which will combine the smooth Frosty with the mint-chocolate-chip flavors of a Thin Mint, but designing the treat was harder than people may think.",
      "The cookie didn't lend itself to a frozen treat, so the recipe had to be tweaked, according to John Li, Wendy's Vice President of Research and Development. Instead of frozen pieces or chunks of cookie, Li and his team wound up developing a fudge-like cookie butter that can be swirled into a Frosty.",
      "The cookie butter adds the flavor of a Thin Mint but makes it possible for customers to still get their Frosty quickly. The way it's swirled into the frozen treat ensures that customers get a taste of Thin Mint in every sip or bite. The swirl can be added to either chocolate or vanilla Frosty's. Li said they initially thought about only offering one flavor, but decided that the swirl worked well in both.",
      "\"You can't get more nostalgic than a Wendy Frosty and the Girls Scouts,\" said Li. \"The fact that they're coming together really pulls at the heartstrings of food lovers in this country.\"",

      "\"Morgiane\" is believed to be the oldest existing opera written by a Black American -- but despite its historic significance, the show was only performed for audiences for the first time in 2025.",
      "\"Morgiane\" was the magnum opus of New Orleans-born composer Edmond Dede. The opera, based on themes from \"Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves,\" tells the story of a mother, Morgaine, and her daughter, Amine, who fight a tyrannical ruling sultan. Behind the curtain is Dede's remarkable story.",
      "Dede was born a free Black man in New Orleans in 1827. He was educated and moved to France in 1855, leaving just before the Civil War. In France, he studied music at the Paris Conservatoire and performed at Bordeaux's Grand Theatre. He also traveled to Algeria, then a French colony, and was inspired by the struggle of the people there.",
      "Dede returned to the U.S. once, during the height of the Jim Crow era. He was not permitted to perform in theaters, and went back to Europe, vowing that he would never return to his home country.",
      "Dede went on to write 250 songs, ballets and orchestral pieces. The 545-page \"Morgaine\" was his magnum opus, but it was never performed during his lifetime.",
      "In 2014, New Orleans Opera Creole founders Givonna Joseph and Aria Mason found a digital copy of \"Morgaine.\" Opera Creole shares music by composers of African descent, and when they found the piece, they knew they needed to bring it to an audience.",
      "\"I had, you know how you get, a gut feeling that this was important,\" Joseph said. \"I didn't know exactly how.\"",
      "Patrick Quigley, the artistic director designate of Washington, D.C.'s Opera Lafayette, was eager to join the mission. He and Joseph connected in 2023, and they began working with musicians and historians from across the country to bring the never-performed opera to life. First, they transcribed almost 6,000 measures of music into modern notation. When the process was done, they heard music that hadn't been played in over a century.",
      "\"It's this fabulous combination of so many different styles of music, both European and American all together in one place,\" Quigley said.",
      "Excerpts from \"Morgaine\" were played at New Orleans' St. Louis Cathedral on January 24. The church was likely the site of Dede's baptism. The entire opera was performed at Opera Lafayette for the first time on Feb. 3.",
      "\"It was an incredible moment for Washington, D.C., and it was an incredible moment for American music,\" said Quigley, who conducted the performance.",
      "There were also two other performances, one in New York City and one in College Park, Maryland. The brief tour served as a kind of homecoming for Dede, said Joseph.",

    "summary": "The move comes amid a government-wide effort to cut probationary workers by the Department of Government Efficiency task force led by billionaire Elon Musk.",
    "story": [
      "Probationary workers across multiple federal health agencies in the Department of Health and Human Services received virtually identical letters Saturday evening informing them they would be terminated from their positions, sources told CBS News.",
      "\"Unfortunately, the Agency finds that you are not fit for continued employment because your ability, knowledge and skills do not fit the Agency's current needs, and your performance has not been adequate to justify further employment at the Agency,\" read the letter obtained by CBS News.",
      "The letter was signed by Jeffrey Anoka, acting head of human resources for the Department of Health and Human Services. One health official told CBS News thousands of letters were sent out Saturday.",
      "Probationary workers are those that generally have less than a year on the job and are easier to fire than other federal staff.",
      "The move comes amid a government-wide effort to cut probationary workers by the Department of Government Efficiency task force, or DOGE, led by billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "More than 5,000 probationary workers at health agencies had initially been slated to be let go, though not all received letters of termination Saturday. Some letters were also sent in error to people not intended to be let go, officials said.",
      "Some agencies have also been granted exemptions for a portion of their staff on the chopping block, as backlash has mounted over cuts at agencies like the Indian Health Service.",
      "Also not on the final list of cuts ordered by the Trump administration was the CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service, the agency's \"disease detectives,\" CBS News learned. Officials overseeing the fellowship had initially warned health departments and those in their ranks that they would be halved.",
      "Fellowship programs elsewhere in the agency were not as lucky. Officials said CDC's Public Health Associate Program, which places recent graduates in health departments throughout the country, was cut.",
      "Other agencies losing staff Saturday include the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, which oversees the nation's pandemic stockpiles, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the National Institutes of Health.",
      "A White House official said Saturday that workers exempted from the cuts included scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the FDA, workers for Medicare and frontline healthcare providers.",
      "\"This isn't a haphazard effort of us axing whoever we can 'get away' with axing for the sake of it. This is a calculated effort to streamline bureaucracy,\" said the official.",
      "Calley Means, an adviser for newly sworn-in Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., defended the firings for reasons beyond cost savings, reiterating a criticism made during President Trump's presidential campaign that officials had not done enough to address drivers of sliding life expectancy in the U.S.",
      "\"It would be irrational not to make changes,\" Means wrote in a post to X.",
      "At the FDA, an employee said Saturday that scientists, engineers and an attorney had been among those terminated from the regulatory agency's ranks late Saturday.",
      "Cuts included parts of the FDA funded largely from fees that companies pay when they submit applications, not taxpayer dollars \u2014 like centers overseeing regulation of tobacco products and medical devices.",
      "The toll inflicted by this week's cuts stretches beyond probationary workers and fellows. Many contractors, who have fewer protections than agency staff, were suddenly told this week that they were being let go.",
      "One former CDC contractor said they had been one of two people on a small team in the Atlanta-based agency who knew how to operate a project to analyze electronic health records for disease surveillance.",
      "The only other person who knew how to use the project was a CDC employee still on probation.",
      "\"I fear they will be overrun with work and will end up dropping many projects. Projects were already beginning to drop while I was there,\" said the former CDC contractor.",
      "Many scientists that CBS News spoke to said they had uprooted their lives for the chance to serve the federal government, sometimes taking steep pay cuts from what they could be earning in academia or the private sector. Others had been on probation for staff roles after many years working for the same agency as a contractor.",
      "One former National Institutes of Health scientist said they had been reassured in a tearful meeting with their supervisors Friday that the decision had nothing to do with their performance, and had received praise for the progress they had made in the time since they had been hired.",
      "\"Words cannot adequately express how financially screwed I am,\" the former NIH scientist said.",

    "summary": "The bird flu case had respiratory symptoms and has since been released from the hospital.",
    "story": [
      "Ohio's health department confirmed Saturday that a farmer in the state was discharged from the hospital after being sickened by bird flu, marking the fourth American to have been hospitalized with the H5N1 virus.",
      "\"The individual had respiratory symptoms. He was previously hospitalized and has since been released,\" a spokesperson for Ohio's health department told CBS News in an email Saturday.",
      "Authorities in Ohio had previously refused to disclose the status of their bird flu case, which was first announced earlier this week in a man who had contact with sick poultry.",
      "News of the hospitalization comes a day after Wyoming announced the third U.S. hospitalization from bird flu, linked to exposure to an infected backyard flock.",
      "Wyoming's health department declined Saturday to release details of the patient's status, who is hospitalized in neighboring Colorado.",
      "\"We don't typically provide information on patient condition due to privacy concerns,\" spokesperson Kim Deti said in an email to CBS News.",
      "Deti said that the hospitalization in Colorado occurred within the last two weeks, \"just a couple of days\" after they had been exposed to sick poultry at their home in Wyoming's Platte County.",
      "The vast majority of human cases have been blamed on direct, often intensive exposure to sick cows or birds.",
      "Data reported so far by the CDC from testing labs suggests that this winter's record surge of influenza is being driven by seasonal strains of the virus, not human-to-human spread of a bird flu strain.",
      "However, investigations of a handful of human bird flu cases in the U.S. have so far not been able to identify a source of how they may have gotten sick.",
      "The first U.S. bird flu hospitalization was reported last year in Missouri, though health officials think the patient tested positive while hospitalized for other reasons, not bird flu. A second hospitalization was later reported in Louisiana, in a patient who died from the virus.",
      "Which bird flu strain sickened the new cases?",
      "It is unclear which strain of the H5N1 bird flu virus caused the Ohio and Wyoming cases. Answering that question has been a focus of experts and health officials for previous cases, as they track the evolution of the virus.",
      "Federal authorities usually take samples of the virus and analyze them for worrying mutations that might raise the risk of the virus spreading between humans or causing more severe disease.",
      "A spokesperson for Ohio's health department said that information was not immediately available. Wyoming has also not confirmed the genotype of their case, though the state's veterinarian says flocks in the county where the patient lived recently tested positive for the B3.13 strain of the virus.",
      "A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether that had occurred for these cases.",
      "Many human cases of bird flu in the U.S. to date have been in dairy workers after working with sick cows infected by the B3.13 strain of the H5N1 virus.",
      "Scientists suspect that B3.13 is less severe for humans. Until recently, it had been the only bird flu strain detected spreading between dairy herds and into some nearby poultry farms.",
      "But a new strain called D1.1 has grown to dominate the spread between wild migratory birds in recent months. That strain has also contributed to a surge of spillovers from wild birds to poultry flocks that have driven up egg prices nationwide.",
      "D1.1 was also behind the first confirmed U.S. fatality from bird flu, in the Louisiana patient. A child in Canada was also hospitalized with D1.1 last year.",
      "D1.1 has also spread at least twice now in recent weeks from birds to dairy herds, the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed Friday, dashing hopes that the spillover which started the B3.13 dairy herd outbreaks in late 2023 was a one-off.",

They can raise money to finance his tax cuts elsewhere, protect U.S. industries and pressure other countries into making concessions on such issues as their own trade barriers, immigration and drug trafficking. Mainstream economists mostly view tariffs as counterproductive: They are paid by import companies in the United States, which try to pass along the higher costs to consumers and can thereby add to inflationary pressures throughout the economy.",

      "The filing raises questions about Musk's role in the Trump administration and at DOGE, a cost-cutting task force created by Mr. Trump on Jan. 20 that is working at a number of agencies, including the\u00a0Treasury Department\u00a0and the\u00a0IRS, in an effort to find fraud and waste. The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about Musk's role at DOGE.",
      "Musk, along with fellow billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy, was\u00a0originally tasked\u00a0by Mr. Trump with providing \"advice and guidance from outside of Government\" and partnering with the White House and Office of Management & Budget to drive large scale structural reform.\" Ramaswamy\u00a0left DOGE\u00a0in January and is planning a run for Ohio governor.",
      "Since Mr. Trump took office, DOGE has driven massive federal employee cuts and paused tranches of congressionally approved spending. Many of those federal workers, their unions and Democratic officials have argued that this is a result of Musk's unchecked authority. Mr. Trump has suggested that Musk largely answers to him.",
      "Last week, Musk \u2014 the world's richest person, with a net worth of\u00a0$398 billion\u00a0\u2014 stood behind President Trump at the Oval Office, describing DOGE's work as taking \"very simple and basic\" steps to cut federal spending. During a lengthy Q&A that followed, Mr. Trump was asked if there was anything Musk was told that he can't touch.",
      "\"Well, we haven't discussed that much,\" Mr. Trump replied. \"I'll tell him to go here, go there, he does it. He's got a very capable group of people.\"",
      "Asked by reporters if he was working closely with agency heads, Musk replied that he was working \"in partnership\" with them. \"I check with the president to make sure that this is what the president wants to happen,\" Musk added. \"We talk almost every day, and I double check things to make sure. 'Is this something, Mr. President, you want us to do this?' Then we'll do it.\"",
      "Multiple lawsuits, alarm bells",
      "At the same time, DOGE's efforts have sparked multiple lawsuits and\u00a0raised alarms\u00a0from Democratic lawmakers and consumer advocates over its reported access to personal data of millions of Americans and businesses.",
      "The White House's Feb. 17 filing came at the request of U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is hearing a case about the\u00a0constitutionality\u00a0of Musk's actions since the start of Mr. Trump's presidency. Fourteen states ranging from Arizona to Washington are suing Musk, DOGE and Mr. Trump, alleging that Musk is exceeding his authority and taking \"actions that can only be taken by a nominated and principal officer of the United States.\"",
      "The lawsuit claims that Musk \"does not occupy an office created by law and has no authority to exercise the powers of a principal officer, or any other officer.\"",
      "\"There is no greater threat to democracy than the accumulation of state power in the hands of a single, unelected individual,\" the lawsuit alleges. \"In recent weeks, defendant Elon Musk, with President Donald J. Trump's approval, has roamed through the federal government unraveling agencies, accessing sensitive data and causing mass chaos and confusion for state and local governments, federal employees and the American people,\" the lawsuit further claims.",
      "At a Feb. 17 hearing, Justice Department attorney Harry Graver told Chutkan, \"There is not a single instance of Musk or USDS commanding these actions,\" referring to\u00a0widespread firings of government employees\u00a0across various agencies last week. Instead, the government workers were fired by officials within their own agencies, he said.",
      "When asked at a press briefing at Mar-a-lago on Tuesday about the administration's contention that Musk isn't in charge of DOGE, Mr. Trump said, \"Elon is to me a patriot. So, you could call him an employee, you could call him a consultant, you could call him whatever you want.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Judge Chutkan ruled against the states' request for a temporary restraining order to stop Musk and DOGE from accessing data systems at seven federal agencies and firing or putting their employees on leave. She found that the states failed to show that they would suffer imminent, irreparable harm without relief, writing in her ruling that \"the 'possibility' that defendants may take actions that irreparably harm plaintiffs 'is not enough.'\"",
      "Nonetheless, in a hearing Monday, Chutkan warned that the alleged actions by Musk and DOGE are \"concerning\" and \"troubling.\" She said the mass firings of thousands of federal workers is \"not a small or common thing\" and noted that Musk has not been nominated to a position by the president or confirmed by the Senate.",
      "\"No actual or formal authority\"",
      "The Feb. 17 filing states that Musk is working as a \"senior adviser to the president,\" comparing his role to that of Anita Dunn under the Biden administration. Dunn served as a special government employee when she advised former President Biden, the filing noted.",
      "\"Like other senior White House advisers, Mr. Musk has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself,\" the filing said. \"Mr. Musk can only advise the president and communicate the president's directives.\"",
      "Musk's role as a\u00a0special government employee, or SGE, confirmed by the White House earlier this month, indicates that he'll work for the Trump administration for 130 days or less during a one-year period. The SGE role was created in 1962 as a way of enabling the government to tap outside expertise,\u00a0according\u00a0to the publication Government Executive.",
      "Because Musk isn't paid for his work at the White House, his financial disclosure report\u00a0will remain confidential, a White House official has told CBS News on condition of anonymity",
      "Asked at the Oval Office last week whether there are issues with conflicts of interest between his businesses, including Tesla and Space X \u2014 which receive billions in federal contracts \u2014 and DOGE, Musk said that the task force's work is transparent. He added, \"So you can see everything that's going on, and then you can see, am I doing something that benefits one of my companies or not? It's totally obvious.\"",

    "story": [
      "The presence of Elon Musk's cost-cutting task force, the Department of Government Efficiency, at the IRS is sparking fresh concerns from Democratic lawmakers about the safety of taxpayer information, and whether the group's work could cause delays in taxpayers receiving their refunds.",
      "An IRS employee associated with DOGE is requesting access to the IRS' Integrated Data Retrieval System, or IDRS, which would provide the group with access to tax data for individuals and businesses, according to a Trump administration official.",
      "\"Waste, fraud, and abuse have been deeply entrenched in our broken system for far too long,\" said White House spokesman Harrison Fields. \"DOGE will continue to shine a light on the fraud they uncover as the American people deserve to know what their government has been spending their hard-earned tax dollars on.\"",
      "News of the request was first reported by\u00a0the Washington Post. The IRS didn't immediately return a request for comment.",
      "In a Feb. 17 letter to the IRS, Senators Ron Wyden and Elizabeth Warren, both Democrats, cited reports that DOGE is \"pressuring the IRS to agree to a memorandum of understanding (\"the MOU\") which would give software engineers working for Elon Musk at DOGE broad access to IRS systems, property and datasets which include the private tax return information of hundreds of millions of American citizens and businesses.\"",
      "Supporters of DOGE view its efforts as a way to cut what they see as bloated federal spending at a time when the nation's outlays are outstripping its tax revenue, pushing the federal debt to an all-time high of\u00a0$36 trillion. But the group's efforts have also sparked several lawsuits, with consumer advocates and Democratic lawmakers raising alarms earlier this month after DOGE gained access to the Treasury Department's\u00a0payment system, which stores personal data for most Americans.",
      "IRS data is particularly sensitive, given that it reflects financial details for millions of Americans and businesses, ranging from their income, employers, losses, investments, dependents and other items. Under the IRS taxpayers' bill of rights, \"information [taxpayers] provide to the IRS will not be disclosed unless authorized by the taxpayer or by law.\"",
      "\"Software engineers working for Musk seeking to gain access to tax return information have no right to hoover up taxpayer data and send that data back to any other part of the federal government and may be breaking the law if they are doing so,\" Wyden and Warren wrote in the Feb. 17 letter.",
      "The senators pointed to privacy regulations in the tax code that they said provide \"strong legal protections\" for taxpayer data, noting that violation of those laws can result in incarceration or other criminal penalties. They added that even if the DOGE employees are employed at the Treasury Department, which oversees the IRS, they may still be violating the law by accessing taxpayer data.",
      "\"There are serious statutory and regulatory restrictions on when employees outside the Treasury Department may gain access to tax return information,\" the letter said.",
      "It added, \"To date, no information on DOGE employees or any others executing orders on Musk's behalf have revealed any clear, stated purpose as to why they need access to return information, whether they have followed all required laws to gain access to IRS systems, and what steps the IRS has taken to ensure that inspection of tax return is contained to authorized personnel and not disclosed to any unauthorized parties.\"",
      "Protections for taxpayer data were increased in the 1970s after former President Nixon sought to use the IRS against his political opponents, according to New York University's Tax Law blog.",
      "\"Congress acted to put in place ironclad guarantees against such abuses and a bipartisan consensus emerged to ensure the privacy of every American's tax information,\" Robert Weissman, the co-president of consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Musk and DOGE's attempt to gain access to IRS data raises profound questions about whether those protections are now being shredded.\"",
      "In an interview with Fox News, Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff, said DOGE was seeking to find signs of tax fraud.",
      "\"We are talking about performing a basic anti-fraud review to ensure that people are not engaging in large scale theft of federal taxpayer benefits,\" he said. \"I mean, for example, we pay billions of dollars a year in child tax credit payments to illegal aliens, billions with a B. So these are systematic, programmatic reforms that we're talking about here.\"",
      "Delays to IRS tax refunds?",
      "Wyden and Warren also raised concerns about DOGE's impact on tax refunds this year.",
      "DOGE's work at the IRS comes as the tax agency is in the middle of the current tax season, when about 140 million individual tax returns are expected to be filed before the April 15 deadline. For many households, their tax refund check \u2014 which last year averaged more than $3,100 \u2014 is often their biggest cash influx of the year.",
      "\"We are also extremely concerned that DOGE personnel meddling with IRS systems in the middle of tax filing season could, inadvertently or otherwise, cause breakdowns that may delay the issuance of tax refunds indefinitely,\" the Feb. 17 letter said. \"Any delay in refunds could be financially devastating to millions of Americans who plan their budgets around timely refunds every spring.\"",
      "In the meantime, the IRS is preparing to fire thousands of probationary workers in the middle of tax season, the Associated Press reported, citing two sources familiar with the agency's plans. It's unclear how many IRS workers could be impacted, however, the AP noted. Federal workers in a probationary period typically have less than one year on the job and have not yet gained civil service protection.",
      "The cuts would come even as IRS employees were told they would not be able to participate in the Trump administration's earlier \"deferred resignation\" offer until after the tax filing deadline had passed.",
      "A letter sent earlier this month to IRS workers said that \"critical filing season positions in Taxpayer Services, Information Technology and the Taxpayer Advocate Service are exempt\" from the administration's buyout plan until May 15.",
      "Taxpayers have until April 15 to file their taxes unless they are granted an extension.",

      "\"We've removed these images for violating our policies and will continue monitoring for other violating posts.

      "How to spot deepfake images online",
      "An analysis of over a dozen of these images by Reality Defender, a platform that works to detect AI-generated media, showed that many of the photos were deepfake images \u2014 with AI-generated, underwear-clad bodies replacing the bodies of celebrities in otherwise real photographs. A few of the images were likely created using image stitching tools that do not involve AI, according to Reality Defender's analysis.",
      "\"Almost all deepfake pornography does not have the consent of the subject being deepfaked,\" Ben Colman, co-founder and CEO of Reality Defender told CBS News on Sunday. \"Such content is growing at a dizzying rate, especially as existing measures to stop such content are seldom implemented.\"",

      "Under Meta's Bullying and Harassment policy, the company prohibits \"derogatory sexualized photoshop or drawings\" on its platforms. The company also bans adult nudity, sexual activity and adult sexual exploitation, and its regulations are intended to block users from sharing or threatening to share non-consensual intimate imagery. Meta has also rolled out the use of \"AI info\" labels to clearly mark content that is AI manipulated.",
      "But questions remain over the effectiveness of the tech company's policing of such content.

      "Meta's Oversight Board, a quasi-independent body that consists of experts in the field of human rights and freedom of speech, and makes recommendations for content moderation on Meta's platforms, told CBS News in an emailed statement that the company's current regulations around sexualized deepfake content are insufficient.",
      "The Oversight Board cited recommendations it has made to Meta over the past year,\u00a0 including urging the company to make its rules clearer by updating its prohibition against \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" to specifically include the word \"non-consensual\" and to encompass other photo manipulation techniques such as AI.",
      "The board has also recommended that Meta fold its ban on \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" into the company's Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations, so moderation of such content would be more rigorously enforced.",
      "Asked Monday by CBS News about the board's recommendations, Meta pointed to the guidelines on its transparency website, which show the company is assessing the feasibility of three of four recommendations from the oversight board and is implementing one of its suggestions, though Meta noted in its statement on its site that it is currently ruling out changing the language of its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to include the phrase \"non consensual.\" Meta also says it is currently unlikely   to move its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to within its Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations.",
      "Meta noted in its statement that it was still considering ways to signal a lack of consent in AI-generated images. Meta also said it was considering reforms to its Adult Sexual Exploitation policies, to \"capture the spirit\" of the board's recommendations.",
      "\"The Oversight Board has made clear that non-consensual deepfake intimate images are a serious violation of privacy and personal dignity, disproportionately harming women and girls. These images are not just a misuse of technology \u2014 they are a form of abuse that can have lasting consequences,\" Michael McConnell, an Oversight Board co-chair, told CBS News on Friday.",
      "\"The Board is actively monitoring Meta's response and will continue to push for stronger safeguards, faster enforcement, and greater accountability,\" McConnell said.",

      "YouTube TV has reached a deal with Paramount to keep channels like CBS, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon and MTV days after failed negotiations for a new contract had briefly left the future of their streaming alliance in limbo.",
      "\"We're happy to share that we've reached a deal to continue carrying Paramount channels, including CBS, CBS Sports, Nickelodeon and more,\" YouTube announced in a statement Saturday night. \"With this agreement, YouTube TV will continue to offer 100+ channels and add-ons including Paramount+ with SHOWTIME and will enable more user choice in the future.\"",

      "YouTube, the online video platform owned by Google, launched its subscription-based arm for television streaming in 2017, partnering with broadcast and cable networks that gave YouTube TV access to their programs.",
      "Whether the company's prior agreement with Paramount, which allowed it to stream a broad range of channels under the network's umbrella, would hold up for another year was uncertain until Saturday, as a dispute over carriage fees halted talks for a contract renewal.",
      "Carriage fees are costs that paid TV providers, like YouTube, make to broadcasters, like Paramount, for the rights to carry that broadcaster's programming. Spats between providers and broadcasters have occurred with increasing frequency in recent years, at times causing disruptions for viewers.",
      "Paramount had accused YouTube TV of pressuring the network to agree to \"one-sided terms\" that favored the streamer, while YouTube said their team was \"working hard to reach a fair agreement with Paramount that allows us to keep their channels,\" in separate statements issued in the days leading up to the eventual deal.",
      "To avoid a lapse in programming access for subscribers as negotiations continued past their original deadline, YouTube TV announced a \"short-term extension\" for talks with Paramount on Thursday. That meant its customers could continue accessing Paramount channels despite the then-ongoing contract clash.",

      "The federal labor agency said 2,447 workers cast ballots against union representation while 829 voted in favor of joining the independent union, which is made up of former and current Amazon workers.

      "In November, an NLRB administrative law judge ordered a third union election for Amazon warehouse workers in Bessemer after determining that the company committed six violations leading up to a rerun election in March 2022.

    "published": "Sat, 15 Feb 2025 08:48:53 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration is firing thousands of federal workers on probationary status, or those without civil service protections.",
    "story": [
      "Probational federal employees who lost their jobs on Thursday as part of the Trump administration's mass\u00a0firing of government workers\u00a0expressed shock and anger at the terminations, which they contend will hurt the government's ability to provide services.",
      "President Trump is moving quickly to shrink the U.S. federal government \u2014 the nation's largest employer \u2014 saying he is slashing wasteful spending and pushing to make the nation's civil workforce more responsive to his administration's policies. Federal workers in a probationary period typically have less than one year on the job and have not yet gained civil service protection.",
      "Federal workers who received termination notices on Thursday described receiving nonpersonalized emails informing them they had been removed from their position, with little communication from their supervisors. The workers said they had entered public service because of a commitment to serve the public interest, whether by helping protect consumers from predatory financial services or by supporting veterans.",
      "\"We had all received these notices that cites probationary regulations and says we're being let go because 'you are not fit for continued employment because your ability and skills do not fit the agency's needs,'\" Elizabeth Aniskevich, an attorney with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, told CBS News.",
      "A termination letter provided to CBS News by a former employee at the Department of Veterans Affairs informed the worker that his job was ending because \"you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the agency would be in the public interest.\"",
      "The VA worker, who had previously held federal jobs across different agencies for more than a decade, said he was dismayed to learn that he was considered a probationary worker after taking the Veterans Affairs job last fall, as it reset his government employment.",
      "\"Basically the gist [of the termination letter] is laying out I was a probationary employee, what my rights of appeal are, but my continued employment was no longer in the public interest,\" said the VA worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern that speaking publicly could jeopardize his chances of finding another government job. \"I came into the house \u2014 probably for a couple weeks my wife and I joked, 'Did I still have a job?' \u2014 I told her, and I lost it. It's devastating.\"",
      "Another VA employee, who told CBS News his work was rated as \"outstanding\" in his most recent performance review, said receiving an impersonal termination letter was hurtful.",
      "\"It feels like a copy/paste mass firing that takes nothing into account of the people, the human cost,\" said Greg House, 34, a disabled veteran who was terminated from his job at the VA's public affairs office in Salt Lake City, a job that he started in March 2024. He added, \"The idea that the federal workforce is too bloated feels like a scapegoat more than anything else. Nobody joins the federal government to get rich.\"",
      "The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has instructed agencies to report their final numbers of fired probationary employees by 8 p.m Eastern time on Tuesday, according to a source familiar with the matter.",
      "The White House press office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Unions claim firings are illegal",
      "Five unions for government employees have sued Mr. Trump and other officials in his administration over the firing of probationary workers, alleging the move is illegal because it violates procedures for making \"reductions in force,\" a formal process used by government agencies to dismiss employees.",
      "Reductions in force, or RIFs, can be made based on a number of issues, such as if there's not enough work or funding for federal workers, according to OPM.",
      "Mr. Trump's order \"directs agencies to promptly engage in RIFs for none of the specified, allowable reasons, but instead for the purpose of 'eliminating waste, bloat and insularity,'\" the lawsuit claims, citing the president's Feb. 11 executive order for widespread layoffs of government workers.",
      "Some experts are pushing back on the idea that the government workforce is too large, pointing out that federal employment has grown little since 1980. Prior to the firings, some agencies and services had already been grappling with staffing shortages, including the Veterans Health Administration.",
      "Impact on services",
      "The VA employee who was fired Thursday said he took exception to Mr. Trump's claim that the terminations would make the government more efficient, noting that his group, which had been trying to fill several empty positions, had more work than they could handle.",
      "\"We are under-resourced as it is, so cutting jobs won't do it,\" he said, adding that the firings will directly impact veterans. \"We have ongoing projects to try to construct and repair facilities to help veterans \u2014 we're already behind.\"",
      "A Food and Drug Administration employee \u2014 who also requested anonymity because she's in a probationary period in her job but hasn't received a termination letter \u2014 expressed concern that the firings would slow essential work, both because of the loss of skilled employees and a hit to employee morale.",
      "\"We're rather leanly staffed \u2014 the people on some of these teams have a tremendous workload,\" she said. \"It'll slow down things like drugs approvals ... it'll have a tremendous, terrible impact on access to drugs and generic drugs.\"",
      "Because many of the probationary workers are younger employees, the firings could add to long-term problems facing the federal workforce, where twice as many workers are over age 60 than under 30, said Elizabeth Linos, the Emma Bloomberg associate professor of public policy and management at Harvard's Kennedy School.",
      "\"This will exacerbate the existing human capital crisis if probationary employees are more likely to be young, and more likely to have the skills that a 21st century government operation needs,\" she said.",
      "Where jobs are getting cut",
      "As of May 2024, the most recent data available, about 216,000 federal employees had been in their jobs for less than one year, according to government data from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.",
      "The government agency with the most probationary employees is the VA, with about 56,000 workers bearing that designation, OPM data shows. The VA on Friday said it had fired more than 1,000 employees. The agency didn't respond to a request for comment about whether more firings could be coming.",
      "\"Make no mistake \u2014 Trump is looking to fire probationary employees because it is easy, not because it is good for veterans or cost-effective,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut who serves on the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, told CBS News in a statement. \"In fact, it is a massive waste of taxpayer dollars to fire employees the department just invested months into recruiting, vetting and training.\"",
      "Department of Health and Human Services officials expect most of the agency's roughly 5,200 probationary employees to be fired Friday, Feb. 14, under the Trump administration's move to get rid of nearly all probationary employees, according to an audio recording of a National Institutes of Health department meeting obtained by the Associated Press.",
      "In that meeting, an NIH office director told employees that some probationary staff with specialized skills might retain their positions. Probationary staff being terminated would receive an email Friday afternoon, the AP reported, citing the recording.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Thursday intensified its sweeping efforts to\u00a0shrink the size of the federal workforce, the nation's largest employer, by ordering agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who hadn't yet gained civil service protection \u2014 potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of workers.",
      "In addition, workers at some agencies were warned that large workplace cuts would be coming.",
      "The decision on probationary workers, who generally have less than a year on the job, came from the Office of Personnel Management, which serves as a human resources department for the federal government. The notification was confirmed by a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss it publicly.",
      "Even workers in the personnel office itself weren't immune: Dozens of probationary employees at OPM were told on a Thursday afternoon group call that they were being dismissed and then instructed to leave the building within a half-hour, according to another person who likewise spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "It's expected to be the first step in sweeping layoffs. President Trump signed an executive order Tuesday that told agency leaders to plan for \"large-scale reductions in force.\"",
      "Elon Musk, to whom the president has given wide leeway to slash government spending with his Department of Government Efficiency, called Thursday for the elimination of whole agencies.",
      "\"I think we do need to delete entire agencies as opposed to leave a lot of them behind,\" Musk said via a videocall to the World Governments Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. \"If we don't remove the roots of the weed, then it's easy for the weed to grow back.\"",
      "Everett Kelley, the president of the American Federation of Government Employees representing federal workers, said the administration \"abused\" the probation status of workers \"to conduct a politically driven mass firing spree, targeting employees not because of performance, but because they were hired before Trump took office.\"",
      "Thursday's order was an expansion of previous directions from OPM, which told agencies earlier this week that probationary employees should be fired if they weren't meeting high standards. It's not clear how many workers are currently in a probationary period. According to government data maintained by OPM, as of March 2024, 220,000 workers had less than a year on the job \u2014 the most recent data available.",
      "The firing of probationary employees began earlier this week and has included the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Department of Education workers.",
      "At least 39 were fired from the Education Department on Wednesday, according to a union that represents agency workers, including civil rights workers, special education specialists and student aid officials.",
      "The layoffs also hit Department of Veterans Affairs researchers working on cancer treatment, opioid addiction, prosthetics and burn pit exposure, Sen. Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, said Thursday.",
      "Murray said in a statement that she heard from VA researchers in her state who were told to stop their research immediately, \"not because their work isn't desperately needed, but because Trump and Elon have decided to fire these researchers on a whim.\"",
      "The VA announced Thursday that it had laid off more than 1,000 non-\"mission critical\" probationary workers and the move would \"save the department more than $98 million per year, and VA will redirect all of those resources back toward health care, benefits and services for VA beneficiaries.\"",
      "Half of the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention's Epidemic Intelligence Service officers \u2014 a group known as\u00a0the CDC's \"disease detectives\" \u2014 were among the cuts made Friday, multiple health officials tell CBS News.",
      "The Trump administration also moved Friday to fire more than 400 employees at the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, a group that defends government workers, said the Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service would be hit especially hard by laying off probationary employees because it has trouble recruiting inspectors required to be present at all times at most slaughterhouses.",
      "The civilian federal workforce, not including military personnel and postal workers, is made up of about 2.4 million people. While about 20% of the workers are in Washington D.C. and the neighboring states of Maryland and Virginia, more than 80% live outside the Capitol region.",
      "Layoffs are unlikely to yield significant deficit savings. When the Congressional Budget Office looked at the issue, it found the government spent $271 billion annually compensating civilian federal workers, with about 60% of that total going to workers employed by the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs.",
      "The government could, in theory, cut all those workers and still run a deficit of over $1 trillion that would continue to grow as tax revenues are needed to keep up with the growing costs of Social Security and Medicare.",
      "Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said firing employees on probation is flawed because it targets younger workers.",
      "\"Baby Boomers are retiring right and left, so actually the people you want to keep are probably most of the people who are right now on probation,\" said Kamarck, who worked in former President Bill Clinton's Democratic administration when about 426,000 federal jobs were cut over more than eight years in a deliberative effort aimed at reinventing government. \"They're younger and presumably have better skills, and that's who you want.\"",
      "Mr, Trump's initial attempt to downsize the workforce was the deferred resignation program, commonly described as a \"buyout,: which offered to pay people until Sept. 30 if they agreed to quit. The White House said 75,000 people signed up, and a federal judge cleared a legal roadblock for the program Wednesday.",
      "However, the number of workers who took the offer was less than the administration's target, and Mr. Trump has made it clear he would take further steps.",
      "Employees at the National Science Foundation and Housing and Urban Development Department were told this week that large reductions, in some cases a halving of the workforce, would be coming, according to a person familiar with the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it.",
      "The order the president signed Tuesday stipulated that government functions not required by law would be prioritized for cuts and hiring will be restricted. With exceptions for functions such as public safety, only one employee can be added for every four who leave. In addition, new hires would generally need approval from a representative of the DOGE, expanding the influence of Musk's team.",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 09:14:30 -0500",
    "summary": "The federal government is the nation's largest employer, yet the size of its workforce hasn't kept up with U.S. population growth, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is moving swiftly to shrink the U.S. federal government \u2014 the nation's largest employer \u2014 a move that he has said will slash wasteful spending and make the nation's civil workforce more responsive to his administration's dictates.",
      "Mr. Trump has described the federal government as \"bloated\" and filled with \"people that are unnecessary.\" While the federal government has inefficiencies, as do all large and complex organizations, some experts are pointing out that the government workforce has grown little since 1980, and that some agencies and services had already been grappling with staffing shortages, including the Veterans Health Administration and the FAA's air traffic control centers.",
      "\"There's no indication that the government is particularly bloated in terms of numbers of federal workers \u2014 that number hasn't really changed over the past decades,\" Elizabeth Linos, the Emma Bloomberg associate professor of public policy and management at Harvard's Kennedy School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The problem we were facing over the past decades isn't one of bloat, but of vacancies.\"",
      "On Thursday, the Trump administration ordered agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees\u00a0\u2014 who generally have less than a year on the job and who aren't yet covered by civil service protections \u2014 potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of workers.",
      "As Mr. Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency push to slash spending, here's what to know about the nation's federal workforce and the potential impact on Americans of scaling back government.",
      "What are Trump and Musk doing to shrink the federal workforce?",
      "Working with billionaire Elon Musk, Mr. Trump has offered a \"deferred resignation\" plan to more than 2 million federal employees, that would grant pay through the end of September while not working, in exchange for agreeing to step down. A federal judge on Tuesday cleared the program to proceed after it had been paused.",
      "About 75,000 workers have accepted the offer, and the Trump administration said that the deferred resignation program was closed as of 7 p.m. Feb. 12. The offer excludes members of the armed forces, U.S. Postal Service workers, and those who work in jobs related to immigration enforcement and national security.",
      "In another move aimed at remaking the federal workforce, Mr. Trump this week also signed an executive order to reduce the number of government employees and limit hiring.",
      "The administration's order on Thursday to cut probationary workers is expected to be the first step in sweeping layoffs. According to federal data, there are about 220,000 federal workers with less than a year on the job, representing about 9% of the government workforce.",
      "\"I think we do need to delete entire agencies as opposed to leave a lot of them behind,\" Musk said via a videocall to the World Governments Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. \"If we don't remove the roots of the weed, then it's easy for the weed to grow back.\"",
      "Is the federal workforce growing?",
      "As Mr. Trump and Musk charge ahead, some policy experts note that the federal workforce has decreased relative to the U.S. population when compared with earlier decades. The upshot: There are fewer government workers providing services to more U.S. residents than in prior years, according to new research from the Center for Economic and Policy Research.",
      "The federal workforce has waxed and waned over the years, but its size today puts it on the same footing as during the 1980s, when the U.S. population was about 220 million. Today, there are more than 330 million U.S. residents.",
      "How big is the federal workforce?",
      "The U.S. has more than 2.4 million federal workers, excluding those who work for the U.S. Postal Service, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. (As a self-funded agency, the USPS relies on sales of stamps and other products and services to support its operations.)",
      "\"In absolute terms, the federal workforce is slightly smaller than it was 50 years ago, even though the U.S. population has increased by two-thirds during that time period,\" noted Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who managed the Clinton Administration's National Performance Review, an effort to cut government spending in the 1990s, in a Jan. 28 report.",
      "In the 1940s, the federal workforce represented 4.5% of non-farm workers, a share that's dwindled to 1.5% today, according to CEPR's analysis.",
      "How efficient is the federal workforce?",
      "There's no overarching measure of the efficiency of the federal workforce, Linos of Harvard's Kennedy School noted. But agencies typically review their own operations to identify gaps that affect their ability to provide services.",
      "The federal workforce's efficiency should be measured on whether agencies are delivering the services they've been tasked to handle, she added. In recent years, many agencies have added data-driven measurements to determine whether they are providing those services to Americans.",
      "For instance, the Social Security Administration's most recent annual performance report identified long wait times for callers as a trouble spot, and added that it would like to shave the hold times to 12 minutes on average from its 34 minute on-hold time for fiscal year 2024. But that \"aspirational goal\" was being evaluated amid a hiring freeze, the report added.",
      "The Social Security Administration, which last year served a record 68 million beneficiaries, is working with its smallest staff in 50 years, former Social Security Commissioner Martin O'Malley said in November congressional testimony.",
      "To be sure, the U.S. government suffers from various types of inefficiencies, with a 2024 U.S. Government Accountability Office\u00a0report\u00a0estimating that as much as $521 billion annually is lost to fraud, or about 8% of federal spending.",
      "Federal spending also has ballooned in recent years, although much of the increase is due to higher spending on Social Security and paying interest on federal debt,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.",
      "What agencies have the most federal workers?",
      "The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has the most federal workers, with more than 487,000 employees, according to data from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, or OPM. That's followed by the Department of Homeland Security, with more than 222,000 workers; and the U.S. Army, with 221,000 employees.",
      "Some of the agencies that have been targeted by Mr. Trump are relatively small by comparison. For instance, the president is considering an executive order to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education, which has about 4,200 employees.",
      "Where are federal workers based geographically?",
      "Only about 7% of federal workers are located in Washington, D.C., proper, according to a 2024 Congressional Research Service report. But when adding the federal workers located in Virginia and Maryland, the larger Washington, D.C., metro area represents about 20% of the entire government workforce.",
      "Roughly 80% of federal workers are located outside the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, and civil service employees are employed in every U.S. state, the CRS report noted.",
      "While Washington, D.C., proper has the largest number of federal workers, at about 162,000, other states aren't far behind: California employs about 147,000 federal workers, while Texas has about 130,000.",
      "Additional states with sizable federal workforces include Florida, at about 94,000, and Georgia, with almost 80,000 federal workers, the analysis found.",
      "What does the typical federal worker earn?",
      "The average annual salary of federal workers tops $106,000, Pew Research Center found, citing OPM data.",
      "Federal salaries skew into the six figures because many civil service workers hold college or professional degrees, and are highly trained. The largest share of federal workers are employed in the medical field \u2014 physicians and nurses who work for the VA, for instance.",
      "Others are professionals such as accountants and attorneys who might be able to earn more if they worked for private employers. For instance, the Commodity Future Trading Commission, which regulates futures contracts and other derivatives, pays its employees an average of $235,910. About 40% of its workforce is comprised of attorneys, Pew found.",
      "How could a much smaller federal workforce affect Americans?",
      "Services could degrade if enough federal workers are cut or resign, Harvard's Linos said. But Americans would still expect a certain level of service, such as getting their benefits paid on time or getting a passport on a timely basis.",
      "To address that issue, the federal government could turn to private-sector contractors to pick up the slack, she added. \"That's more costly \u2014 you end up paying a higher wage to private sector workers with less accountability,\" she noted.",
      "A hit to public services could heighten negative public sentiment about the federal government, Linos added. Public trust in the federal government has declined for decades, falling from about 77% of people in the 1960s who trust the government to do what is right to about 22% today, according to the Pew Research Center.",
      "\"We tell people the government is bloated, the day-to-day experience gets worse, and that feeds the narrative that the government is useless,\" she said.",

    "summary": "America's trading partners keep their markets to closed to U.S. exports, White House says in ordering up plan to impose global tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday signed a memorandum directing his administration to weigh reciprocal tariffs, threatening to impose levies on U.S. imports from nations that put higher duties on American products.",
      "\"I've decided for purposes of fairness that I will charge a reciprocal tariff,\" Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office at a proclamation signing. \"It's fair to all. No other country can complain.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued that its tariff policies would level the competitive playing field for U.S. and foreign manufacturers, although the new taxes would probably be shouldered by U.S. shoppers and businesses either directly or indirectly.",
      "Tariffs, which act as a tax on foreign goods, could lead to higher prices, which are rarely if every welcomed by Americans, and having more import duties on the horizon comes against a backdrop of inflation flaring up once again. Consumer prices in January\u00a0accelerated\u00a0to 3% on an annual basis, signaling the Federal Federal's push to drive inflation down to a 2% annual rate has petered out, at least for now.",
      "Deutsche Bank analysts said in a research note earlier this week that proceeding with reciprocal U.S. tariffs poses \"additional upside risks to the inflation outlook.\"",
      "Trade negotiations",
      "The tariff hikes would vary for affected countries, with a goal of starting new trade negotiations, the Associated Press reported. A senior White House official who spoke to the wire service on condition of anonymity said the reviews required to move forward with the tariffs could be finished within a number of weeks, although the process could take longer.",
      "The plan \"will seek to correct long-standing imbalances in international trade and ensure fairness across the board,\" the White House said in a statement about the tariffs. \"Gone are the days of America being taken advantage of: this plan will put the American worker first, improve our competitiveness in every area of industry, reduce our trade deficit, and bolster our economic and national security,\" it proclaimed.",
      "The announcement came before a meeting between Mr. Trump and Narendra Modi, prime minister of India, a country that could be targeted by U.S. tariffs. Modi has recently sought to assuage the Trump administration's concerns regarding trade issues, moving to cut import India's tariffs on some motorbikes and bourbon whiskey, while also agreeing to receive planes carrying undocumented migrants.",
      "President Trump has placed an additional tariff on Chinese imports for what he says is that nation's role in producing opioid fentanyl. He has also readied tariffs on Canada and Mexico that could take effect next month, after being paused 30 days. Mr. Trump also this week announced 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum that are scheduled to take effect in March.",
      "Applying a matching tariff against select U.S. trading partners is likely an alternative to imposing a more sweeping levy, according to economists. Argentina, Brazil, India and Turkey have the biggest gaps in tariffs with the U.S., trade data shows.",
      "\"While most developed markets would come out relatively unscathed, emerging markets would suffer a greater loss of competitiveness, with India, Brazil and Turkey looking among the most exposed,\" Shilan Shah, deputy chief emerging markets economist with Capital Economics, told investors in a report. \"It is probable that their governments (among others) would provide concessions to President Trump in an attempt to prevent reciprocal tariffs from being imposed.\"",
      "Trump administration officials say tariffs can protect domestic manufacturers and also spur both American and foreign companies to create more jobs in the U.S.",

      "Indeed, as many as 3 in 4 U.S. homeowners could be underinsured, reports CBS News national consumer correspondent Ash-har Quraishi. That means more Americans should get to know their insurance policies, said Jennifer Gray Thompson, CEO of the nonprofit After the Fire USA.",
      "\"Well, the first thing you have to do is actually read your policy, and most of us don't do that, and so really encourage you to either sit down with somebody who is an expert in insurance \u2014 your underwriter [the insurance company] will be able to do this with you,\" Thompson told Quraishi.",
      "How much coverage do I need?",
      "Determining how much insurance you have, versus what you need to rebuild your a home in case of a disaster, is relatively straighforward. Start by taking the dollar amount of your policy coverage limit and dividing that by the square footage of your house or apartment.",
      "The resulting figure should equal the average construction cost per square foot in your area \u2014 a dollar amount Quraishi said you can find by doing an online search for \"construction cast per square foot,\" along with your zip code.",
      "For those who discover they have no protection of any kind of natural disaster, or after doing the math find that they're not sufficiently covered, the next step should be to get the maximum amount of coverage they can.",
      "\"Do go to your underwriter and ask,\" Thompson said. \"Max out on your insurance \u2014 it does cost us a little bit more every single month, but it's just incredibly important. Some people won't call because they're afraid of being dropped. Do not do that.\"",
      "Make a list of all your things",

      "Medicaid\u00a0is complex. The\u00a0$880 billion-a-year\u00a0state-federal program offers health coverage to millions of disabled and low-income Americans. The program covers different services for different people in different parts of the country \u2014 and enrollees may interact with private insurance companies without \"Medicaid\" in their names, leaving some unaware that they're on the program at all.",
      "Although President Donald Trump\u00a0promised to \"love and cherish\" Medicaid, Republicans in Congress last week announced federal budget proposals that could dramatically curtail the program. As that debate begins, here is what you need to know about Medicaid.",
      "What is Medicaid, and how is it different from Medicare?",
      "Medicaid and Medicare were created by the same legislation \u2014 an addition to the Social Security Act \u2014 that was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965.",
      "Medicaid is a government health insurance program for people with low incomes and adults and children with disabilities.",
      "Medicare, by contrast, generally covers those\u00a065 or older.",
      "For older Americans with low incomes, Medicaid covers out-of-pocket costs for Medicare. Such people are commonly called \"dual eligibles,\" because they qualify for both programs.",
      "Who is on Medicaid?",
      "More than 79 million people receive services from Medicaid or the closely related Children's Health Insurance Program. That represents about 20% of the total population of the United States. Most enrollees qualify because of low incomes.",
      "About 40% of all children in the country are covered by Medicaid or CHIP, created in 1997. Both pay for services such as routine checkups, vaccinations, and hospital stays. Medicaid also covers pregnant people before and after they give birth and pays for more than 40% of all births.",
      "Medicaid also covers people with disabilities or complex medical needs and helps them afford services that allow them to live independently in community settings, outside of institutions such as nursing homes and state-run hospitals.",
      "The program serves a diverse cross section of the country. About 40% of people under 65 who use Medicaid are white, 30% are Hispanic, 19% are Black, and 1% are Indigenous people.",
      "Federal Medicaid dollars cannot be used to cover immigrants who are in the U.S. without legal permission, though some states, as well as Washington, D.C.,\u00a0have used their own funds\u00a0to extend Medicaid coverage to such individuals. California was the first state to do so.",
      "What are the income qualifications?",
      "Eligibility generally depends on whether a person is low income, and states have different ways of defining that. For a four-adult household without dependent children, the current national median coverage level is $44,367.",
      "The Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare, which passed in 2010, allowed more people to qualify for Medicaid on the basis of income. This is what is known as \"Medicaid expansion.\"",
      "The law offered states a sizable incentive to add more people to their programs: The federal government would pitch in more money per enrollee to help cover them.",
      "The intention behind the expansion was to close gaps in health insurance programs for the millions of Americans who don't get coverage through an employer. Medicaid would cover people with extremely low incomes, and as their incomes rose, they could move to subsidized health plans sold through the Affordable Care Act's exchanges.",
      "In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court said the decision of whether to expand the program would be\u00a0left up to individual states. Today, 40 states and the District of Columbia \u2014 led by Democrats and Republicans alike \u2014 have opted in.",
      "In the\u00a010 states that haven't expanded\u00a0Medicaid to more low-income adults, the median earnings qualification level is $5,947 a year for a single-person household in 2025. Those who make more are not eligible.",
      "Adults in those states who make too much for Medicaid can also make too little to qualify for help buying plans on the Affordable Care Act exchanges, leaving some unable to afford coverage. An estimated 1.5 million fall into this coverage gap.",
      "Where does the money to pay for it come from?",
      "The federal government pays most of the cost of Medicaid by matching a portion of what states spend.",
      "Currently, the federal government matches at least 50% of state spending and offers states more money for some services and enrollees \u2014 for instance, for children and pregnant women.",
      "Less wealthy states \u2014 determined by considering residents' per capita incomes \u2014 receive a higher match, translating to a higher percentage of federal dollars. In Mississippi, for instance, the federal government picks up\u00a077% of the cost\u00a0of Medicaid.",
      "States also receive a 90% match from the federal government for enrollees eligible for Medicaid under the ACA's expansion.",
      "There is no limit on how much states can spend on the program, and hundreds of billions of federal dollars flow into states each year. In 2023, states\u00a0spent about 15%\u00a0of their own budgets on Medicaid.",
      "What does that money pay for?",
      "Federal law requires all state Medicaid programs to cover certain services, including emergency medical transportation, X-rays and lab work, family planning, and medication-assisted treatment for people with opioid use disorder. The program also covers many nursing and home health services, though federal law allows those benefits\u00a0to be clawed back\u00a0after an enrollee's death.",
      "Beyond that, states have the flexibility to choose the services their Medicaid programs cover. All states cover prescription drugs, and most cover eyeglasses, some dental care, and physical therapy.",
      "Medicaid covers more mental health and long-term care services than any other type of insurance, public or private.",
      "What is Medicaid called in my state?",
      "Medicaid programs can go by\u00a0many different names, even within the same state, in part because most states use private insurance companies to run them. This can be confusing for consumers who may not realize they are actually enrolled in Medicaid.",
      "In\u00a0New York, for instance, Medicaid plans are offered by major companies, such as Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield and UnitedHealthcare \u2014 and some you may not have heard of, such as Amida Care and MetroPlusHealth. In Wisconsin, enrollees may be in BadgerCare Plus; in Connecticut, Husky Health; in Texas, STAR; and in California, Medi-Cal.",
      "How does Medicaid affect hospitals and doctors in my state?",
      "Medicaid generally pays health care providers such as doctors and hospitals less money for services than Medicare or private insurance does. But it can be more money than they'd get caring for people who are uninsured \u2014 and without Medicaid, many more Americans would be uninsured.",
      "Like states, providers and hospitals have come to rely on this money and express concerns that even phasing it out over time would require major adjustments.",
      "What's going to happen to Medicaid?",
      "It's not clear. Republicans in Washington are again pushing for major changes, which could take the form of cuts to federal funding. That could reduce the number of people who qualify, the services available, or both. A similar push focused on repealing and replacing Obamacare in 2017, during Trump's first term, was unsuccessful.",
      "Perhaps one of the biggest obstacles to changing Medicaid is\u00a0its popularity: 77% of Americans \u2014 and majorities of Democrats, independents, and Republicans \u2014 view the program favorably.",
      "At the heart of it all are key questions about the role of government in people's health: How big should the U.S. medical insurance safety net be? Who deserves government assistance? And how will enrollees, states, providers, and the health care system at large absorb major changes to Medicaid, even if a rollout were staggered?",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Feb 2025 23:37:27 -0500",
    "summary": "The move threatens to cast a cloud of uncertainty over many migrants who applying for immigration benefits that would allow them to stay in the U.S. legally and, in some cases, permanently.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has enacted a pause on all immigration applications filed by migrants from Latin America and Ukraine allowed into the U.S. under certain Biden-era programs, citing fraud and security concerns, according to two U.S. officials and an internal memo obtained by CBS News.",
      "The application freeze will remain in place indefinitely while government officials work to identify potential cases of fraud and enhance vetting procedures to mitigate concerns related to national security and public safety, according to the directive.",
      "The move, which had not been previously reported, threatens to cast a cloud of uncertainty over many migrants who were in the process of applying for various immigration benefits that would allow them to stay in the U.S. legally and, in some cases, permanently.",
      "While the exact number of affected migrants is unclear, the hold on applications applies to several Biden administration programs that allowed hundreds of thousands of foreigners to come to the U.S. legally through an immigration law known as parole. That law empowers the U.S. government to welcome foreigners quickly on humanitarian or public benefit grounds.",
      "The Biden administration used parole at an unprecedented scale, partially to encourage migrants to sign up for legal migration channels instead of crossing the southern border unlawfully. The Trump administration moved swiftly to suspend those efforts, arguing that they abused the parole authority.",
      "The Trump administration had previously halted new entries under Biden-era parole policies. But in a memo dated Feb. 14, Andrew Davidson, a top U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services official, ordered an agency-wide \"administrative pause\" on all \"pending benefit requests\" filed by migrants already allowed into the U.S. under three Biden administration programs.",
      "They include a policy, called Uniting for Ukraine, set up to offer a safe haven to those fleeing the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Roughly 240,000 Ukrainians with American sponsors arrived in the U.S. under that process before President Trump took office. Another affected program, known as CHNV, allowed 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans sponsored by American citizens to enter the U.S.",
      "The third impacted program consists of processes that permitted some Colombians, Ecuadorians, Central Americans, Haitians and Cubans with American relatives to come to the U.S. to wait for a family-based green card to become available.",
      "Because those allowed into the U.S. under these programs were only given temporary work permits and deportation protections that typically last for two years, many of them applied for other immigration benefits, lawyers and experts said.",
      "Those benefits include a program known as Temporary Protected Status for migrants from crisis-stricken countries like Haiti, Ukraine and Venezuela; asylum, which allows those fleeing persecution to gain a permanent safe haven in the U.S.; and green cards, or permanent American residency. Because of a Cold War-era law, Cubans paroled into the U.S. are eligible to apply for green cards.",
      "But under the internal USCIS directive, officials will no longer be able to process any applications for these programs or any other benefit if the requests were filed by migrants who arrived in the U.S. under the targeted Biden administration policies.",
      "\"This effectively freezes their ability to move into another legal status,\" said Lynden Melded, who served as the top lawyer at USCIS during the administration of former President George W. Bush and now works as a partner at Berry Appleman & Leiden LLP. \"In the interim, they would remain susceptible to removal from the country if the government terminates their parole status.\"",
      "The USCIS memo said the move is justified because \"[c]urrently, fraud information and public safety or national security concerns are not being properly flagged in USCIS' adjudicative systems.\" The directive cites the Biden administration's move last year to temporarily pause the parole initiative for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans due to fraud concerns.",
      "In his memo, Davidson referenced investigations that he said found thousands of CHNV applications with \"serial sponsors,\" information of deceased individuals or identical addresses. He said some of those cases were proven to be fraud. Davidson also said some migrants allowed into the U.S. under CHNV \"were not fully vetted.\"",
      "The pause, Davidson said in his memo, could potentially be lifted, but only once officials complete a \"comprehensive review and evaluation of the in-country population of aliens who are or were paroled into the United States under these categorical parole programs.\"",
      "Representatives for DHS did not respond to requests to comment on CBS News' reporting.",
      "The Trump administration has targeted those who've come to the U.S. under the Biden-era immigration parole programs in other ways, too.",
      "Last month, officials authorized federal immigration agents to seek the deportation \u2014 including in an expedited fashion in some cases \u2014 of those permitted to enter the U.S. under the CHNV program and other Biden administration parole policies. The administration has also drafted plans to revoke the parole status of many of those who've come to the U.S. under CHNV.",

    "story": [
      "Riyadh, Saudi Arabia \u2014 Senior officials from Russia and the U.S. met in Saudi Arabia Tuesday to begin talks on improving ties and negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine. As CBS News correspondent Holly Williams reports, some felt the Trump administration had granted Vladimir Putin some degree of victory just by agreeing to hold the high-level meeting with his regime as the war he ignited with his full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, grinds on.",
      "That sentiment may be felt most acutely by the leaders of Ukraine, who were not invited to participate in the initial discussion about the fate of their nation.",
      "Delegations led by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met behind closed doors at the Diriyah Palace in Riyadh. The meeting marked another significant step in President Trump's move to reverse three years of U.S. policy focused on isolating Russia over its war on Ukraine, and it is meant to pave the way for a likely meeting between Mr. Trump and Putin.",
      "Speaking to reporters after the meeting, U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said the U.S. and Russian delegations had agreed to establish a \"consultation mechanism to address irritants to our bilateral relationship,\" and Rubio told reporters that would include a re-staffing of the two nations' respective embassies.",
      "Bruce said Rubio and Lavrov had agreed to appoint \"high-level teams to begin working on a path to ending the conflict in Ukraine as soon as possible in a way that is enduring, sustainable, and acceptable to all sides.\" Rubio said the respective embassies in Washington and Moscow would need to be re-staffed, as \"we're going to need to have vibrant diplomatic missions that are able to function normally in order to be able to continue these conduits.\"",
      "Neither Bruce's statement nor a full read-out on the meeting provided by the State Department said anything about involving Ukraine or its European neighbors in the negotiations. The State Department said only that Mr. Trump was, \"the only leader in the world who can get Ukraine and Russia to agree to\" a ceasefire.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday that his country wouldn't accept the outcome of any negotiations conducted without Kyiv's involvement.",
      "Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Waltz suggested Ukraine's government would have a say, calling it \"common sense\" that \"if you're going to bring both sides together, you have to talk to both sides.\"",
      "\"We are absolutely talking to both sides,\" Waltz said, noting Mr. Trump's recent phone call with Zelenskyy, right after he spoke with Putin last week. He also noted Rubio's recent meetings with European officials and the fact that British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is due in Washington next week, saying, \"the facts will continue to push back on this notion that our allies haven't been consulted... they are being consulted, literally, almost on a daily basis, and we'll continue to do so.\"",
      "Rubio told the reporters the European Union was \"going to have to be at the table at some point, because they have sanctions [against Russia] as well.\"",
      "Mr. Trump earlier this month upended U.S. policy toward Ukraine and Russia by saying he and Putin had agreed in a phone call to begin negotiations on ending the war, leaving many Ukrainians feeling betrayed as they seemingly had no say in the matter.",
      "Rubio was accompanied Tuesday by U.S. national security adviser Mike Waltz and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, while Lavrov sat next to the Kremlin's foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov.",
      "The talks marked a significant expansion of U.S.-Russian contacts nearly three years into a war that has seen relations fall to the lowest level in decades.",
      "\"The economic aspect of the discussions\"",
      "Bruce said Rubio and Lavrov had also agreed Tuesday to ongoing cooperation toward economic and investment opportunities \"which will emerge from a successful end to the conflict in Ukraine.\"",
      "In a possible indication of how significant a factor those \"opportunities\" could be in the negotiations, senior Russian businessman Kirill Dmitriev, a Western-educated banker who now heads a government-created investment fund, was also expected to take part in the talks on Tuesday, according to Russian media.",
      "\"I will be responsible for the economic aspect of the discussions,\" Dmitriev was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency ahead of the talks in Riyadh. \"The figure that we are voicing for the first time now is that American business has lost more than $300 billion by leaving the Russian market,\" he said, apparently referring to the impact of sanctions imposed on Russia under former President Biden.",
      "\"Finding joint economic paths, positive solutions to issues, is extremely important, mainly for the U.S. and for many other countries that are beginning to understand that the Russian market is extremely attractive and that it is necessary to be present in it,\" he said, adding that he hoped for \"a positive dialogue.\"",
      "\"We see that President Trump is very actively solving a large number of problems in the world and we hope that the Russian Federation's position will be heard very clearly and the dialogue will continue,\" Dmitriev said, according to Interfax.",
      "Dmitriev, who studied at Stanford and Harvard before working early in his career at Goldman Sachs, previously served as an interlocutor between Moscow and Washington during Mr. Trump's first term in office.",
      "Ukrainians, Europeans sidelined from talks",
      "The recent U.S. diplomatic blitz on the war has sent Kyiv and key allies scrambling to ensure a seat at the table amid concerns that Washington and Moscow could press ahead with a deal that won't be favorable to them.",
      "France called an emergency meeting of European Union countries and the U.K. on Monday to decide how to respond. French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday said he spoke by phone to Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy following the meeting.",
      "\"We seek a strong and lasting peace in Ukraine,\" Macron wrote on X. \"To achieve this, Russia must end its aggression, and this must be accompanied by strong and credible security guarantees for the Ukrainians,\" he said as he vowed to \"work on this together with all Europeans, Americans, and Ukrainians.\"",
      "Before that meeting, Starmer said for the first time Monday that the U.K. could deploy troops to Ukraine to help secure an eventual peace. Sweden also indicated a willingness Monday to deploy forces to Ukraine to keep an eventual peace.",
      "While other European powers declined to make explicit commitments, calling discussions about deploying peacekeepers to Ukraine premature, Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk ruled out sending Polish troops to the neighboring nation.",
      "Ahead of the meeting in France, Tusk did stress that European powers should immediately spend more on defense.",
      "\"If we, Europeans, fail to spend big on defense now, we will be forced to spend 10 times more if we don't prevent a wider war,\" Tusk said on social media.",
      "A boost for \"the status of Saudi Arabia\"?",
      "Ahead of the Riyadh talks, Kirill Dmitriev, the head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund who the Kremlin said might join the meeting, underscored their importance in comments to The Associated Press.",
      "\"Good U.S.-Russia relations are very important for the whole world. Only jointly can Russia and the U.S. address lots of world problems, resolve for global conflicts and offer solutions,\" Dmitriev, who said he and his team would focus on economic issues at the talks, told the AP.",
      "The Saudi-owned satellite channel Al Arabiya, citing the Russian delegation, described Moscow's priority as \"real normalization with Washington.\"",
      "Diriyah Palace sits across the street from Riyadh's Diplomatic Quarter. It's also just next to the Ritz Carlton hotel, which became famous in 2017 after de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman detained other princes and the country's elite there as part of what the royal court called a crackdown on corruption that also sidelined any potential challenge to his taking control of the kingdom.",
      "Hosting the talks is a major step toward a goal Prince Mohammed has pursued throughout the war \u2014 putting the kingdom in the middle of diplomatic negotiations. The Saudis helped in prisoner negotiations and hosted Zelenskyy for an Arab League summit in the kingdom in 2023. Zelenskyy likely will travel to Saudi Arabia later this week.",
      "For Prince Mohammed, once described as a \"pariah\" by former President Joe Biden over the 2018 killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, hosting such talks burnish the otherwise-tarnished image the West has of him.",
      "Ahead of the summit, the Saudi daily newspaper Okaz described the moment as the \"world's eye on Riyadh.\"",
      "Writing in the London-based but Saudi-owned newspaper Asharq Al Awsat, journalist Mishari al-Dhaidi described the summit as \"a major step on the international political chess arena, revealing the status of Saudi Arabia and its positive influence for the benefit of all the people.\"",
      "The prince also has maintained close relations to Russia throughout its war on Ukraine, both through the OPEC+ oil cartel and diplomatically.",
      "Hosting the summit also balances the harsh criticism recently levied by the kingdom's tightly controlled media at Mr. Trump over his repeated comments that he wants the U.S. to \"own\" the Gaza Strip, which has been devastated by the Israeli military offensive there since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack. The Palestinians want Gaza and the West Bank for a future state, something backed by the wider Arab world and nearly all of the international community.",

      "At the Commerce Department, Lutnick, who was CEO at the investment firm Cantor Fitzgerald, will oversee 50,000 employees who do everything from collecting economic statistics to running the census to issuing weather reports. But he's likely to spend a lot of time \u2014 along with Jamieson Greer, Mr. Trump's nominee to be the top U.S. trade negotiator \u2014 managing the president's aggressive plans to impose import taxes on U.S. trading partners, including allies and adversaries alike.",
      "The Senate vote to confirm Lutnick was 51-45.",
      "Mr. Trump views the tariffs as a versatile economic tool. They can raise money to finance his tax cuts elsewhere, protect U.S. industries and pressure other countries into making concessions on such issues as their own trade barriers, immigration and drug trafficking. Mainstream economists mostly view tariffs as counterproductive: They are paid by import companies in the United States, which try to pass along the higher costs to consumers and can thereby add to inflationary pressures throughout the economy.",
      "At his confirmation hearing last month, Lutnick dismissed as \"nonsense'' the idea that tariffs contribute to inflation. He expressed support for deploying across-the-board tariffs \"country by country'' to strong-arm other countries into lowering barriers to American exports.",
      "Mr. Trump last week announced plans for \"reciprocal'' tariffs \u2014 raising U.S. import tax rates to match the higher taxes that other countries impose on goods from the U.S. The move would shatter the rules that have governed world trade for decades. Since the 1960s, tariff rates have mostly emerged from negotiations between dozens of countries. Mr. Trump is commandeering the process.",
      "The president has also imposed 10% tariffs on Chinese imports and effectively raised U.S. taxes on foreign steel and aluminum. He has threatened \u2014 and delayed until March 4 \u2014 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico.",

    "story": [
      "When President Trump issued sweeping pardons to some 1,500 Jan. 6 defendants on his first day in office, his action did not distinguish between those who peacefully wandered the Capitol grounds four years earlier and those who engaged in violence against police.",
      "Now, critics of the move are raising concerns about the dangers posed by some of those convicted of violent felonies who have been released with no plan, and none of the monitoring or restrictions that typically accompany a more traditional parole process.",
      "\"I'm just afraid that I'm going to come home from work one night and he's going to be right there. He's going to be right there sitting on my porch,\" said Shantelle Holeton, a 43-year-old factory worker who says she voted for Trump three times.",
      "Holeton, who spoke with CBS exclusively, said she was abused by Jan. 6 defendant Peter Schwartz in 2019. He was charged and convicted for threatening her.",
      "Then in 2023, a federal judge handed Schwartz one of the longest sentences of any Capitol riot defendant \u2014 more than 14 years in prison on charges that included four counts of assaulting police officers.",
      "Body camera footage from Capitol Hill police during the riot show Schwartz spraying officers with pepper spray and wielding a baton. In court filings, the Department of Justice said he threw the first chair at officers, creating an opening that enabled hundreds of rioters to push back police lines.",
      "Federal prosecutors described Schwartz as \"one of the most violent and aggressive participants in the January 6, 2021 attack on the United States Capitol,\" and as someone who \"has a long history of assaulting police officers and women.\"",
      "Prior to the events of Jan. 6, 2021, Schwartz had amassed a lengthy criminal record that included previous clashes with police. CBS News reviewed dozens of Schwartz' convictions in more than four states for crimes including domestic violence, threatening his girlfriend, and assaulting security officers.",

      "\"A lot of us that were Jan. Sixers were actually innocent,\" Schwartz claimed in an interview with right-wing influencer Christopher Key, days after being released from prison.",
      "Speaking about the mass pardons of Jan 6 rioters during a press conference on Air Force One last week, President Trump said, \"what I did was a great thing for humanity. They were treated very, very unfairly.\"",

Matthew Huttle, who was sentenced to six months in prison for his actions at the Capitol, was killed by a police officer while resisting arrest during a traffic stop in Indiana last month. Elizabeth Hernandez, sentenced to 30 days in federal prison for her role in Jan. 6, was recently handed a 10-year prison sentence for a fatal DUI in Missouri in 2022.",
      "There are no reports that Schwartz has re-offended in the weeks since his release.",
      "Shortly before Schwartz was pardoned, an appeals court reversed only one of the 11 charges against him, and none of the assault charges. Schwartz has been citing the appeals court decision as proof of his innocence while appearing on right-wing media shows.",
      "Schwartz is not the only Jan. 6 defendant with an extensive criminal history. A CBS News analysis of hundreds of sentencing documents found that at least 159 of pardoned Jan. 6 defendants had criminal records prior to that day. That includes at least 41 people who had been convicted of at least one violent crime prior to their actions on Jan. 6.",
      "\"There were a lot of folks who had no criminal history,\" said Jason Manning, a former federal prosecutor involved in more than 50 Jan. 6-related cases.",
      "\"There were a lot of other defendants, however, who had extensive histories of domestic abuse, histories of assaulting police officers for whom assaulting the police on January 6th was not the first time they had assaulted police.\"",
      "Allegations of domestic violence, threats",
      "Holeton says she met Schwartz on Facebook in 2019 and moved in with him in Owensboro, Kentucky, after several months of dating long distance. She says it was perfect for two weeks, and then things changed.",
      "\"I made a comment about how tall the corn had gotten in a week. We lived right across from a cornfield, and that comment started the argument that got me beat up,\" Holeton said.",
      "Holeton alleges Schwartz beat her. She says the violence persisted until she called the police in July 2019 when she alleged Schwartz was threatening to kill her and her son. Photos taken by the Kentucky State Police, and reviewed by CBS News, show numerous firearms belonging to Schwartz found on the property. Schwartz was eventually charged and convicted for \"terroristic threatening\" and possessing a handgun.",
      "Even when Schwartz was in prison, Holeton said she was afraid.",
      "\"I walked around the house with a big butcher knife, because I was afraid that they were just gonna let him out and he was just gonna show up,\" she said.",
      "According to a 2015 incident report, Schwartz also threatened police, reportedly telling an officer in Owensboro, \"I am going to shoot you right in the head.\"",
      "In another police report from 2020, Schwartz's then girlfriend, Shelly Stallings, alleged Schwartz bit her forehead and then continued to punch her in the head. In police bodycam footage, reviewed by CBS News, Stallings can be heard saying, \"I locked him out because I couldn't control him, I don't want to be beat up. \u2026 He just gets violent.\" Schwartz was later convicted of domestic violence.",
      "Holeton was not surprised when she heard Schwartz had been at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "\"He found an opportunity to go and be violent,\" she said. \"That man thrives on violence. He thrives on people fearing him.\"",
      "Two years later, when Holeton heard that Schwartz would be in prison for more than a decade, she said she felt a huge weight had been lifted. She took to TikTok and Facebook to share an old photo of her battered face and a screenshot of Schwartz's sentencing, with the caption, \"whether you agree with the J6 prisoners or not, myself and all the other women he beat on finally got some justice.\"",
      "\"I was like, oh, well, at least I don't have to worry about him just showing up at my house for the next 14 years,\" said Holeton, who did not want to share her specific location out of concern for her safety.",
      "\"He is not a hero\"",
      "Holeton, a registered Democrat, said she has voted for President Trump in the past three elections. She said she decided to vote for him in 2024 because she thought he would improve the economy, and she believed his administration would only pardon Jan. 6 defendants on a case-by-case basis.",
      "In an interview on Fox News in early January, Vice President-elect JD Vance said those who protested peacefully should be pardoned, but he made an exception for rioters who engaged in violence.",
      "\"If you committed violence that day, obviously you shouldn't be pardoned,\" he said. But Vance later told CBS News he supported the president's action, saying it \"rectified a wrong.\"",
      "Holeton believes, \"Most of those people should have been allowed to go home, but not people like Pete.\"",
      "\"The idea of pardoning people who had criminal histories, violent histories, it's a really poor choice if you're thinking about public safety going forward,\" said Manning.",
      "An online fundraiser for Schwartz has raised nearly $90,000 from supporters in the past two years.",
      "\"Pete is not the person that everybody thinks he is,\" said Holeton. \"Everyone is hailing him as a hero and he is not a hero. He is a violent, violent man.\"",

    "story": [
      "Billionaire Elon Musk's role in the Trump administration is to find ways to cut costs through the newly created\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. But a new court\u00a0filing\u00a0from the White House states that the Tesla CEO isn't an employee of DOGE, adding that Musk \"has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself.\"",
      "The filing raises questions about Musk's role in the Trump administration and at DOGE, a cost-cutting task force created by Mr. Trump on Jan. 20 that is working at a number of agencies, including the\u00a0Treasury Department\u00a0and the\u00a0IRS, in an effort to find fraud and waste. The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about Musk's role at DOGE.",
      "Musk, along with fellow billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy, was\u00a0originally tasked\u00a0by Mr. Trump with providing \"advice and guidance from outside of Government\" and partnering with the White House and Office of Management & Budget to drive large scale structural reform.\" Ramaswamy\u00a0left DOGE\u00a0in January and is planning a run for Ohio governor.",
      "Since Mr. Trump took office, DOGE has driven massive federal employee cuts and paused tranches of congressionally approved spending. Many of those federal workers, their unions and Democratic officials have argued that this is a result of Musk's unchecked authority. Mr. Trump has suggested that Musk largely answers to him.",
      "Last week, Musk \u2014 the world's richest person, with a net worth of\u00a0$398 billion\u00a0\u2014 stood behind President Trump at the Oval Office, describing DOGE's work as taking \"very simple and basic\" steps to cut federal spending. During a lengthy Q&A that followed, Mr. Trump was asked if there was anything Musk was told that he can't touch.",
      "\"Well, we haven't discussed that much,\" Mr. Trump replied. \"I'll tell him to go here, go there, he does it. He's got a very capable group of people.\"",
      "Asked by reporters if he was working closely with agency heads, Musk replied that he was working \"in partnership\" with them. \"I check with the president to make sure that this is what the president wants to happen,\" Musk added. \"We talk almost every day, and I double check things to make sure. 'Is this something, Mr. President, you want us to do this?' Then we'll do it.\"",
      "Multiple lawsuits, alarm bells",
      "At the same time, DOGE's efforts have sparked multiple lawsuits and\u00a0raised alarms\u00a0from Democratic lawmakers and consumer advocates over its reported access to personal data of millions of Americans and businesses.",
      "The White House's Feb. 17 filing came at the request of U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is hearing a case about the\u00a0constitutionality\u00a0of Musk's actions since the start of Mr. Trump's presidency. Fourteen states ranging from Arizona to Washington are suing Musk, DOGE and Mr. Trump, alleging that Musk is exceeding his authority and taking \"actions that can only be taken by a nominated and principal officer of the United States.\"",
      "The lawsuit claims that Musk \"does not occupy an office created by law and has no authority to exercise the powers of a principal officer, or any other officer.\"",
      "\"There is no greater threat to democracy than the accumulation of state power in the hands of a single, unelected individual,\" the lawsuit alleges. \"In recent weeks, defendant Elon Musk, with President Donald J. Trump's approval, has roamed through the federal government unraveling agencies, accessing sensitive data and causing mass chaos and confusion for state and local governments, federal employees and the American people,\" the lawsuit further claims.",
      "At a Feb. 17 hearing, Justice Department attorney Harry Graver told Chutkan, \"There is not a single instance of Musk or USDS commanding these actions,\" referring to\u00a0widespread firings of government employees\u00a0across various agencies last week. Instead, the government workers were fired by officials within their own agencies, he said.",
      "When asked at a press briefing at Mar-a-lago on Tuesday about the administration's contention that Musk isn't in charge of DOGE, Mr. Trump said, \"Elon is to me a patriot. So, you could call him an employee, you could call him a consultant, you could call him whatever you want.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Judge Chutkan ruled against the states' request for a temporary restraining order to stop Musk and DOGE from accessing data systems at seven federal agencies and firing or putting their employees on leave. She found that the states failed to show that they would suffer imminent, irreparable harm without relief, writing in her ruling that \"the 'possibility' that defendants may take actions that irreparably harm plaintiffs 'is not enough.'\"",
      "Nonetheless, in a hearing Monday, Chutkan warned that the alleged actions by Musk and DOGE are \"concerning\" and \"troubling.\" She said the mass firings of thousands of federal workers is \"not a small or common thing\" and noted that Musk has not been nominated to a position by the president or confirmed by the Senate.",
      "\"No actual or formal authority\"",
      "The Feb. 17 filing states that Musk is working as a \"senior adviser to the president,\" comparing his role to that of Anita Dunn under the Biden administration. Dunn served as a special government employee when she advised former President Biden, the filing noted.",
      "\"Like other senior White House advisers, Mr. Musk has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself,\" the filing said. \"Mr. Musk can only advise the president and communicate the president's directives.\"",
      "Musk's role as a\u00a0special government employee, or SGE, confirmed by the White House earlier this month, indicates that he'll work for the Trump administration for 130 days or less during a one-year period. The SGE role was created in 1962 as a way of enabling the government to tap outside expertise,\u00a0according\u00a0to the publication Government Executive.",
      "Because Musk isn't paid for his work at the White House, his financial disclosure report\u00a0will remain confidential, a White House official has told CBS News on condition of anonymity",
      "Asked at the Oval Office last week whether there are issues with conflicts of interest between his businesses, including Tesla and Space X \u2014 which receive billions in federal contracts \u2014 and DOGE, Musk said that the task force's work is transparent. He added, \"So you can see everything that's going on, and then you can see, am I doing something that benefits one of my companies or not? It's totally obvious.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Tuesday signed an executive order that directs his administration to find ways to reduce the high costs of in vitro fertilization, or IVF, for Americans struggling with fertility.",
      "At an event at Mar-a-Lago, White House staff secretary Will Scharf told reporters that the order directs the Domestic Policy Council \"to make IVF and other fertility treatments more affordable for more Americans.\" The order requests that the council make policy recommendations within 90 days to protect access to IVF and \"aggressively\" reduce costs for the treatment.",
      "\"These are treatments that have become unaffordable for many Americans or been unaffordable for many Americans,\" Scharf said.",
      "Health insurance companies are not currently required to cover IVF treatments, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars.",
      "The executive order said it's the Trump administration's policy to \"ensure reliable access to IVF treatment, including by easing unnecessary statutory or regulatory burdens to make IVF treatment drastically more affordable.\"",
      "Mr. Trump vowed during the 2024 campaign that the treatments would either be covered by the government or insurance companies if he was reelected.",
      "\"Your government will pay for or your insurance company will be mandated to pay for all costs associated with IVF treatment,\" Mr. Trump said in August 2024.",
      "Weeks after Mr. Trump made the pledge, Senate Republicans blocked legislation that would have protected access to IVF and made the fertility treatments more affordable. Republicans said the legislation was too broad and only two GOP senators \u2014 Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2014 supported it.",
      "\"Republicans support IVF, full stop,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota, who was then the minority whip, said at the time, calling the vote \"an attempt by Democrats to try and create a political issue where there isn't one.\"",
      "The issue of access to fertility treatments became a political flashpoint last February after the\u00a0Alabama Supreme Court\u00a0ruled that frozen embryos were considered children under state law. The ruling caused an uproar and cleared the way for potential wrongful death claims if an embryo did not survive the process, causing several providers to pause IVF treatments.

      "U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan rejected a request for a temporary restraining order sought by 14 Democrat-led states as they pursue a challenge to Musk's actions. The states have argued that Musk, who the White House said is categorized as a special government employee, has unchecked authority and is violating the Constitution's Appointments Clause.",
      "But in a 10-page decision, Chutkan found that the states have failed to show that they will suffer imminent, irreparable harm without relief.",
      "\"The court is aware that DOGE's unpredictable actions have resulted in considerable uncertainty and confusion for plaintiffs and many of their agencies and residents,\" she wrote. \"But the 'possibility' that defendants may take actions that irreparably harm plaintiffs 'is not enough.'\"",
      "Chutkan, though, added that the states' claim that Musk's actions violate Appointments Clause has \"serious implications.\" Citing Supreme Court precedent, she wrote that they are the \"executive abuses\" that the constitutional provision seeks to prevent.",
      "\"Musk has not been nominated by the president nor confirmed by the U.S. Senate, as constitutionally required for officers who exercise 'significant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States,'\" she said. \"Bypassing this 'significant structural safeguard of the constitutional scheme,' Musk has rapidly taken steps to fundamentally reshape the Executive Branch.\"",
      "President Trump issued an executive order establishing the Musk-led DOGE on his first day in office and tasked the agency with reducing the size of the government and cutting federal spending. Since then, DOGE's employees have been dispatched to more than a dozen agencies to implement Mr. Trump's agenda. In a court filing on Monday, the White House sought to clarify that Musk is not the formal head of DOGE, but oversees the effort as a senior White House adviser.",
      "DOGE's actions raised alarms for Democrats and labor unions representing federal workers after it was revealed that Musk and his team had gained access to government systems. Musk has publicly called for entire agencies to be \"deleted,\" and DOGE has claimed on social media that it is responsible for contracts being canceled.",
      "In an effort to combat DOGE's efforts, several states and the unions have filed federal lawsuits seeking to stop the task force from having access to information and payment systems.",

      "\"An individual accountable only to the president \u2014 if he answers to anyone at all \u2014 is exercising apparently limitless power within the Executive Branch,\" the states wrote in their complaint. \"Mr. Musk's conduct has wreaked havoc on the federal government and caused mass chaos and confusion for state and local governments, federal employees, the American public, and people around the world who depend on the United States for leadership and support.\"",
      "The states asked Chutkan to issue a temporary restraining order that would temporarily bar Musk and DOGE from accessing data systems at the Office of Personnel Management and the Departments of Education, Labor, Health and Human Services, Energy, Transportation and Commerce. They also asked her to prevent him from terminating, furloughing or placing on involuntary leave any federal employees at those agencies.",
      "The Justice Department, though, argued that the states cannot identify any imminent, irreparable harm \u2014 one of the four factors they have to prove to receive relief \u2014 that warranted the court's intervention. The Trump administration also said the relief sought by the states was too broad and would sweep in anyone affiliated with DOGE, including Mr. Trump and Senate-confirmed administration officials.",
      "Justice Department lawyers wrote in a court filing that the states' claim that Musk has the authority to make decisions for the government is \"wrong,\" and \"rests entirely on conflating influence and authority.\"",
      "\"An advisor does not become an officer simply because the officer listens to his advice. And stripped of their lengthy rhetoric, the states do not actually cite a single example of where Elon Musk (or anyone at USDS) has been given formal authority to exercise the sovereign power of the United States,\" they wrote, referring to the U.S. DOGE Service, the entity's formal name.",
      "A declaration filed by Joshua Fisher, director of the White House's Office of Administration, noted that Musk serves as a senior advisor to the president, as well as a special government employee. He has \"no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself,\" Fisher stated in the filing. Musk is also not the administrator of DOGE, according to the declaration.",
      "Chutkan held a hearing to consider the states' request on Monday, and she appeared skeptical that the states had shown that they would be imminently harmed by Musk and DOGE's actions.",
      "A \"generalized fear that this is going to happen, even if it looks like it's likely to happen,\" is not enough to satisfy the need for a temporary restraining order, she said.",
      "\"I'm not seeing it so far,\" Chutkan told a lawyer for the states, adding that they were effectively seeking a \"prophylactic\" temporary restraining order, which she said is \"not allowed.\"",
      "But Anjana Samant, a lawyer for the state of New Mexico, which is leading the suit, called DOGE and its actions a \"one-of-a-kind situation.\"",
      "The nation has never experienced \"this type of wielding of power in this way,\" she said",
      "Chutkan warned that the alleged actions by Musk and DOGE are \"concerning\" and \"troubling.\" She said the mass firings of thousands of federal workers is \"not a small or common thing\" and noted that Musk has not been nominated to a position by the president nor confirmed by the Senate.",
      "Musk, Chutkan said, is a private citizen tasked with directing an organization, DOGE, to have access to \"the entire workings of the federal government.\" She noted that, according to the states, the task force has fired workers, cut contracts and terminated programs, \"all without apparently any congressional oversight.\"",
      "\"The allegation isn't that agencies can't manage their own workforce,\" she said. \"The allegation is that DOGE is coming into these agencies and accessing data and firing people, terminating contracts. They're essentially running the government. That's the problem.\"",

      "Graham acknowledged that while \"there's been a bit of debate between the House and the Senate about what to do and why,\" he decided to move forward with the budget resolution due to a \"sense of urgency\" about implementing Mr. Trump's immigration agenda.",
      "\"The problem we have now is that ICE is running out of money,\" Graham said. \"And to my colleagues in the House, I hope you can pass one big beautiful bill meeting the priorities of President Trump and what we've been promising to do as a party. But we've got to move on this issue.\"",
      "The House also advanced its own budget proposal out of committee last week, which includes up to $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, spending cuts of at least $1.5 trillion and an increase of the debt ceiling by $4 trillion. The House is away this week on recess and plans to bring its own resolution when lawmakers return next week.",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise urged in a post on X shortly after Thune's announcement Tuesday that it's \"time to act on ALL of the powerful mandates\" that voters delivered to Mr. Trump in November's election. The Louisiana Republican touted the many components that would be included \"in one big, beautiful bill\" that will start moving when the House approves its own budget.",
      "Thune's announcement on Tuesday that the Senate will vote on the proposal as soon as this week marks a step forward. But approving the budget resolution is just one hurdle in the reconciliation process.",
      "Reconciliation allows lawmakers to bypass the 60-vote threshold in the Senate that makes advancing partisan legislation extremely difficult. But in order to use it, lawmakers must first approve identical budget resolutions through both chambers and direct committees to craft bills reconciling spending with the new budget goals. The legislation can ultimately include only provisions dealing with taxes, spending or the debt limit, and any new spending must be paid for. The Senate parliamentarian must also sign off on the package, and settles disputes over whether a provision has direct budgetary consequences.",
      "Despite support among Senate Republicans for a two-bill approach, House Republicans have argued that passing two pieces of legislation carries a wider margin for error, given the narrow GOP majority in the lower chamber.",
      "Senate Democrats have expressed opposition to the budget resolution. During the committee markup, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington called the resolution \"pro-billionaire, anti-middle class,\" while Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon warned of potential cuts to Medicaid, saying he expects an \"effort to keep the Medicaid cuts hidden behind the curtain, but they're going to come sooner or later.\"",

      "\"Great kickoff with @DeptofDefense,\" the X account for DOGE said Friday. \"Looking forward to working together to safely save taxpayer dollars and eliminate waste, fraud and abuse.\"",
      "Two defense officials confirmed DOGE personnel's visit, but the Defense Department declined to comment on who specifically attended those meetings.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told reporters traveling with him in Europe that he was looking forward to working with DOGE.",
      "\"We welcome DOGE to the Pentagon, and I hope to welcome Elon to the Pentagon very soon and his team, working in collaboration with us,\" Hegseth said last week. \"There are waste, redundancies and headcounts in headquarters that need to be addressed.\"",
      "The Defense Department has an annual budget of over $800 billion and more than 3 million personnel, including civilian employees and military service members. The nonpartisan Peter G. Peterson Foundation notes that defense spending represents nearly half of all discretionary spending in the U.S. \u2014 47% in 2024 \u2014 and the U.S. spends more than the next nine countries combined on defense.",
      "\"Where we can find billions of dollars \u2014 and he's right to say billions \u2014 inside the Defense Department, every dollar we save there is a dollar that goes to warfighters, and that's good for the American people,\" Hegseth said, adding that climate programs might be an area to consider for cuts.",
      "He did not elaborate on what other areas of the department's budget were likely to be targeted.",
      "The Trump administration has been asked whether there is any oversight of DOGE's cost-cutting effort, since it was created by Elon Musk, whose companies are estimated to have contracts with the federal government totalling billions of dollars through SpaceX, Starlink and Tesla. Reuters noted that SpaceX CEO Gwynne Shotwell has estimated that the company had $22 billion in U.S. contracts, $15 billion from NASA. An exact accounting of Musk's defense contracts can't be established, however, because a number of the contracts are classified.",
      "In a lawsuit filed by several Democratic state attorneys general against Mr. Trump and Musk that challenges Musk's appointment and his access to data in several departments, the White House said Musk is not the administrator of DOGE and is not employed by DOGE. Joshua Fisher, the White House director of the Office of Administration, in a filing with the court defined Musk's role as special adviser to the president, similar to the role of Anita Dunn in the Biden administration.",
      "In the lawsuit, the state attorneys general are arguing that Mr. Trump \"delegated virtually unchecked authority to Mr. Musk without proper legal authorization from Congress.\"",
      "The Trump administration has presented Musk as the leader of the cost-cutting effort on several occasions. In the Oval Office last week, Mr. Trump asked Musk to detail what \"your team\" has found.",
      "\"Elon is a great patriot,\" Hegseth said during the briefing with reporters in Europe, adding that DOGE and the Defense Department would work in coordination.",
      "\"We're not going to do things that are to the detriment of American operational or tactical capabilities,\" Hegseth said.",

      "In Florida and California, local media outlets reported on hundreds of protesters carrying out \"Not my Presidents Day\" protests. The \"No Kings\" theme was orchestrated by the 50501 Movement and marked the second set of protests criss-crossing the nation in less than two weeks. A similar nationwide event on Feb. 5 drew participants in dozens of cities. Both sets of rallies denounced Mr. Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk, the head of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, which the administration says is designed to slash federal spending.",
      "Nearly 1,000 people marched in the snow from the Statehouse in Boston to City Hall, chanting \"Elon Musk has got to go\" and other slogans. The temperature was below freezing, with wind chills in the teens.",
      "Boston protesters, some dressed in Revolutionary War-style clothing, carried signs saying such things as \"This is a Coup\" and \"Cowards Bow to Trump, Patriots Stand Up.\" One sign had a depiction of Uncle Sam saying \"I Want You to Resist.\"",
      "\"I thought it was important to be here on Presidents Day to demonstrate for what America stands for,\" said Emily Manning, 55, a Boston engineer who came to the rally with her two teenage sons. \"American values are not the values of the plutocracy or the limited few rich people.\"",
      "Organizers of Monday's protests, which were focused on state capitals and major cities including Washington, D.C.; Orlando, Florida; and Seattle, said they were targeting \"anti-democratic and illegal actions of the Trump administration and its plutocratic allies.\"",
      "One sign at the rally that attracted hundreds in the nation's capital said, \"Deport Musk Dethrone Trump.\"",
      "Many demonstrations were slated for cities where temperatures were well below freezing as a polar vortex worked its way across the country.",
      "The rallies followed a series of executive orders from Mr. Trump and came just days after\u00a0job cuts across federal agencies as part of an effort to reduce the government workforce. Many of those administration actions are facing legal challenges.",
      "In Phoenix, hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the Capitol carrying signs reading \"No Kings\" and \"Resist Fascism.\" Security barred protesters from entering the building after a few tried to get inside. Demonstrators were seeking access to a state Senate committee hearing on legislation that would require law enforcement officers across the state to support federal immigration policy.",
      "Protest organizer December Archer said her goal was to keep the event civil. She quickly came between someone trying to enter the Statehouse and a security guard who pushed the protester back through the doorway.",
      "\"We're trying to make sure everything stays civil and stays respectable because again, we're here to make a statement, not be the statement,\" Archer said.",
      "A state Senate committee heard the measure in a packed room and it passed in a party-line vote,\u00a0CBS Phoenix affiliate KPHO-TV reports.",
      "The station quoted the bill's sponsor, Senate President Warren Petersen, as saying, \"After the past four years of lawlessness at our border, it is imperative that every level of government supports efforts to safeguard our communities from the harms of illegal immigration. Arizona is a border state, and as such, we need to empower our sworn agents to enforce our laws and assist the Trump Administration's efforts on this front.\"",

Altman was told King had been resistant to giving DOGE officials access to the database.",

    "story": [
      "In Fresno, California, social media rumors about impending immigration raids at the city's schools left some parents panicking - even though the raids were all hoaxes. In Denver, a real immigration raid at an apartment complex led to scores of students staying home from school, according to a lawsuit. And in Alice, Texas, a school official incorrectly told parents Border Patrol agents might board school buses to check immigration papers.",
      "President Trump's immigration policies are already affecting schools across the country, as officials find themselves responding to rising anxiety among parents and their children, including those who are here legally. Mr. Trump's executive actions vastly expanded who is eligible for deportation and lifted a ban on immigration enforcement in schools.",
      "While many public and school officials have been working to encourage immigrants to send their children to school, some have done the opposite. Meanwhile, Republicans in Oklahoma and Tennessee have put forward proposals that would make it difficult - or even impossible - for children in the country illegally and U.S.-born children of parents without documentation to attend school at all.",
      "As they weigh the risks, many families have struggled with separating facts from rumor.",
      "Anxiety spreading",
      "In the Alice Independent School District in Texas, school officials told parents that the district \"received information\" that U.S. Border Patrol agents could ask students about their citizenship status during field trips on school buses that pass through checkpoints about 60 miles from the Texas-Mexico border. The information ended up being false.",
      "Angelib Hernandez of Aurora, Colorado, began keeping her children home from their schools a few days a week after Mr. Trump's inauguration. Now she doesn't send them at all.",
      "She's worried immigration agents will visit her children's schools, detain them and separate her family.",
      "\"They've told me, 'Hopefully we won't ever be detained by ourselves,'\" she said. \"That would terrify them.\"",
      "Hernandez and her children arrived about a year ago and applied for asylum. She was working through the proper legal channels to remain in the U.S., but changes in immigration policies have made her status tenuous.",
      "In the past week, her fears have intensified. Now, she says, her perception is \"everyone\" - from Spanish-language media to social media to other students and parents - is giving the impression that immigration agents plan to enter Denver-area schools. The school tells parents that kids are safe. \"But we don't trust it.\"",
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents aren't known to have entered schools anywhere. But the possibility has alarmed families enough that some districts are pushing for a change in the policy allowing agents to operate in schools.",
      "Denver Public Schools has sued the Department of Homeland Security, accusing the Trump administration of interfering with the education of young people in its care. Denver took in 43,000 migrants from the southern border last year, including children who ended up in the city's public schools. Attendance at schools where migrant kids are concentrated has fallen in recent weeks, the district said in the lawsuit, saying the immigration raid at a local apartment complex was a factor.",
      "The support Denver schools have given to students and families to help through the uncertainty involves \"tasks that distract and divert resources from DPS's core and essential educational mission,\" lawyers for the district said in the lawsuit.",
      "Some pushing tougher stands",
      "Around the country, conservatives have been questioning whether immigrants without legal status should even have the right to a public education.",
      "Oklahoma's Republican state superintendent, Ryan Walters, pushed a rule that would have required parents to show proof of citizenship - a birth certificate or passport - to enroll their children in school. The rule would have allowed parents to register their children even if they couldn't provide proof, but advocates say it would have strongly discouraged them from doing so. Even the state's Republican governor, Kevin Stitt, thought the rule went too far - and vetoed it.",
      "In Tennessee, Republican lawmakers have put forward a bill that would allow school districts to decide whether to admit students without papers. They say they hope to invite legal challenges, which would give them a chance to overturn a four-decade-old precedent protecting the right of every child in the country to get an education",
      "The implications of immigration policy for U.S. schools are enormous. Fwd.us, a group advocating for criminal justice and immigration reform, estimated in 2021 that 600,000 K-12 students in the U.S. lacked legal status. Nearly 4 million students - many of them born in the U.S. - have a parent living in the country illegally.",
      "Afraid to go to school",
      "Immigration raids have been shown to impact academic performance for students - even those who are native-born. In North Carolina and California, researchers have found lower attendance and a drop in enrollment among Hispanic students when local police participate in a program that deputizes them to enforce immigration law. Another study found test scores of Hispanic students dropped in schools near the sites of workplace raids.",
      "In Fresno, attendance has dropped since Mr. Trump took office by anywhere from 700 to 1,000 students a day. Officials in the central California district have received countless panicked calls from parents about rumored immigration raids - including about raids at schools, said Carlos Castillo, chief of diversity, equity and inclusion at the Fresno Unified School District. The feared school raids have all been hoaxes.",
      "\"It goes beyond just the students who ... have citizenship status or legal status,\" Castillo said. Students are afraid for their parents, relatives and friends, and they're terrified that immigration agents might raid their schools or homes, he said.",
      "A school principal recently called Castillo in tears after a family reached out to say they were too afraid to go buy groceries. The principal went shopping for the family and delivered $100 in groceries to their home - and then sat with the family and cried, Castillo said.",
      "The district has been working with families to inform them of their rights and advise them on things like liquidating assets or planning for the custody of children if the parents leave the U.S. The district has partnered with local organizations that can give legal advice to families and has held almost a dozen meetings, including some on Zoom.",

      "\"It is shameful to toss aside dedicated public servants who have chosen to work on behalf of their fellow Americans,\" Spero said. \"These employees were devoted to their jobs and the safety critical mission of the FAA. This draconian action will increase the workload and place new responsibilities on a workforce that is already stretched thin.\"",
      "The impacted workers include systems specialists, safety inspectors, maintenance mechanics, administrative staff and more, the union said.",
      "Spero said messages began arriving after 7 p.m. on Friday and continued late into the night. More might be notified over the long weekend or barred from entering FAA buildings on Tuesday, he said.",
      "The employees were fired \"without cause nor based on performance or conduct,\" Spero said, and the emails were \"from an 'exec order' Microsoft email address\" \u2014 not a government email address.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Monday in a post on X that \"the FAA alone has a staggering 45,000 employees. Less than 400 were let go, and they were all probationary, meaning they had been hired less than a year ago. Zero air traffic controllers and critical safety personnel were let go.\"",
      "In addition, a\u00a0Transportation Department spokesperson said in a statement that, \"The FAA continues to hire and onboard air traffic controllers and safety professionals, including mechanics and others who support them.\"",
      "News of the firings hit the FAA when it faces a shortfall in controllers. Federal officials have been raising concerns about an overtaxed and understaffed air traffic control system for years, especially after a series of close calls between planes at U.S. airports. Among the reasons they have cited for staffing shortages are noncompetitive pay, long shifts, intensive training and mandatory retirements.",
      "In the Jan. 29 fatal crash between a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter and American Airlines passenger jet, which is still under investigation, one controller was handing both commercial airline and helicopter traffic at the busy airport.",
      "Just days before the collision, President Trump had already fired all the members of the Aviation Security Advisory Committee, a panel mandated by Congress after the 1988 PanAm 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. The committee is charged with examining safety issues at airlines and airports.",
      "One FAA employee who was fired over the weekend suggested he was targeted for his views on Tesla and X, formerly Twitter, not as part of a general probationary-level sweep. Both are owned by Elon Musk, who is leading the president's effort to cut the federal government.",
      "Charles Spitzer-Stadtlander posted on LinkedIn that he was fired just after midnight Saturday, days after he started getting harassing messages on Facebook.",
      "\"The official DOGE Facebook page started harassing me on my personal Facebook account after I criticized Tesla and Twitter,\" Spitzer-Stadtlander wrote. \"Less than a week later, I was fired, despite my position allegedly being exempted due to national security.\"",
      "He added: \"When DOGE fired me, they turned off my computer and wiped all of my files without warning.\"",
      "Spitzer-Stadtlander said he was supposed to be exempted from the probationary firings because the FAA office he worked in focused on national security threats such as attacks on the national airspace by drones.",
      "The Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency did not immediately respond to the AP's request for comment.",
      "Duffy wrote on X on Sunday that a team from Musk's SpaceX would visit the FAA's command center in Virginia on Tuesday to get a first-hand look at the current system.

      "The talks were organized after U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced the U.S. would be shifting its security priorities away from Europe, and President Trump said the U.S. would engage in unilateral talks with Russia aimed at ending the war in Ukraine.",
      "Ahead of the meeting, Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer said for the first time that the U.K. could deploy troops to Ukraine to help secure an eventual peace. He said he'd stress to other European leaders that, \"we have got to show we are truly serious about our own defense and bearing our own burden.\"",
      "\"We are facing a once-in-a-generation moment for the collective security of our continent,\" Starmer said in a weekend editorial in Britain's Telegraph newspaper. \"This is not only a question about the future of Ukraine \u2014 it is existential for Europe as a whole.\"",
      "He said the U.K. was prepared to \"play a leading role in accelerating work on security guarantees for Ukraine,\" including more military support and putting British troops on the ground as part of a peacekeeping force if necessary.",
      "\"I do not say that lightly. I feel very deeply the responsibility that comes with potentially putting British servicemen and women in harm's way. But any role in helping to guarantee Ukraine's security is helping to guarantee the security of our continent, and the security of this country,\" Starmer said, adding that \"U.S. support will remain critical and a U.S. security guarantee is essential for a lasting peace.\"",
      "\"The end of this war, when it comes, cannot merely become a temporary pause before Putin attacks again,\" Starmer said.",
      "On Monday, a British official confirmed to CBS News that the prime minister would visit Washington at the end of next week, where he will become the first European leader to meet in-person with the president since Mr. Trump moved back into the White House.",
      "Sweden also indicated a willingness Monday to deploy forces to Ukraine to keep an eventual peace, with the country's Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard stressing in a radio interview the need to first \"negotiate a fair and sustainable peace that respects international law, that respects Ukraine and that ensures above all else that Russia can't just withdraw and regroup and attack Ukraine or another country within a few years.\"",
      "\"When we have such a peace in place, it will need to be maintained, and for that our government is not ruling out anything,\" Stenergard said, according to the French news agency AFP.",
      "While other European powers declined to make explicit commitments, calling discussions about deploying peacekeepers to Ukraine premature, Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk ruled out sending Polish troops to the neighboring nation.",
      "Ahead of the meeting in France, Tusk did stress that European powers should immediately spend more on defense.",
      "\"If we, Europeans, fail to spend big on defense now, we will be forced to spend 10 times more if we don't prevent a wider war,\" Tusk said on social media.",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Feb 2025 09:33:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration has halted DOGE's firings of hundreds of federal employees working on the nation's nuclear weapons programs.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has paused the firings of hundreds of federal employees working on the nation's nuclear weapons programs, in a reversal that has left workers confused and experts cautioning that DOGE's blind cost cutting will put communities at risk.",
      "Late Thursday afternoon, a number\u00a0probationary employees of the National Nuclear Security Administration were fired, a source in the Energy Department confirmed. This is the entity within the department that manages the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile, among other responsibilities. Three U.S. officials told The Associated Press up to 350 employees at the NNSA were abruptly laid off, with some losing access to email even before they'd learned they were fired, only to try to enter their offices on Friday morning to find they had been locked out. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.",
      "One of the hardest hit offices was the Pantex Plant near Amarillo, Texas, which saw about 30% of the cuts. Those employees work on reassembling warheads, one of the most sensitive jobs across the nuclear weapons enterprise, with the highest levels of clearance.",
      "The hundreds let go at NNSA were part of a DOGE purge across the Department of Energy that targeted about 2,000 employees.",
      "\"The DOGE people are coming in with absolutely no knowledge of what these departments are responsible for,\" said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, referencing Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency team. \"They don't seem to realize that it's actually the department of nuclear weapons more than it is the Department of Energy.\"",
      "By late Friday night, the agency's acting director, Teresa Robbins, issued a memo rescinding the firings for all but 28 of those hundreds of fired staff members.",
      "\"This letter serves as formal notification that the termination decision issued to you on Feb. 13, 2025 has been rescinded, effective immediately,\" said the memo, which was obtained by the AP.",
      "The accounts from the three officials contradict an official statement from the Department of Energy, which said fewer than 50 National Nuclear Security Administration staffers had been let go, referring to them as \"probationary employees\" who \"held primarily administrative and clerical roles.\"",
      "But that wasn't the case. The firings prompted one NNSA senior staffer to post a warning and call to action.",
      "\"This is a pivotal moment. We must decide whether we are truly committed to leading on the world stage or if we are content with undermining the very systems that secure our nation's future,\" deputy division director Rob Plonski posted to LinkedIn. \"Cutting the federal workforce responsible for these functions may be seen as reckless at best and adversarily opportunistic at worst.\"",
      "While some of the Energy Department employees who were fired dealt with energy efficiency and the effects of climate change, issues not seen as priorities by the Trump administration, many others dealt with nuclear issues, even if they didn't directly work on weapons programs. This included managing massive radioactive waste sites and ensuring the material there doesn't further contaminate nearby communities.",
      "That incudes the Savannah River National Laboratory in Jackson, South Carolina; the Hanford Nuclear Site in Washington state, where workers secure 177 high-level waste tanks from the site's previous work producing plutonium for the atomic bomb; and the Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee, a Superfund contamination site where much of the early work on the Manhattan Project was done, among others.",
      "Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio and Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, both Democrats, called the firings last week \"utterly callous and dangerous.\"",
      "Not all of the NNSA staff who had been reinstated could be reached after they were fired, and some were reconsidering whether to return to work, given the uncertainty created by DOGE.",
      "Many federal employees who had worked on the nation's nuclear programs had spent their entire careers there, and there was a wave of retirements in recent years that cost the agency years of institutional knowledge.",
      "But it's now in the midst of a major $750 billion nuclear weapons modernization effort \u2014 including new land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, new stealth bombers and new submarine-launched warheads. In response, the labs have aggressively hired over the past few years: In 2023, 60% of the workforce had been there five years or less.",
      "Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the firings could disrupt the day-to-day workings of the agency and create a sense of instability over the nuclear program both at home and abroad.",
      "\"I think the signal to U.S. adversaries is pretty clear: throw a monkey wrench in the whole national security apparatus and cause disarray,\" he said. \"That can only benefit the adversaries of this country.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Feb 2025 09:11:47 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump has terminated the heads of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board, sparking legal challenges over their removal.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's firings of the members of independent agencies and boards have prompted a string of legal fights that could set the Supreme Court up to reconsider and potentially overturn a 90-year-old decision that shields certain executive branch officials from being removed after political shifts in the White House.",
      "Since returning to the presidency, Mr. Trump has terminated the heads of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board, as well as the director of the Office of Government Ethics and the special counsel, Hampton Dellinger, who oversees the office that investigates whistleblower complaints.",
      "The officials learned of their firings through emails stating that they had been removed from their respective positions at their agencies, according to court filings.",
      "But in subsequent lawsuits challenging their removal, some of the officials have alleged that Mr. Trump violated federal laws passed by Congress that created the agencies and limited the president to removing their members only for cause \u2014 in cases of neglect of duty or malfeasance.",
      "The president has said the heads of executive branch agencies should share his administration's objectives, but the firings may have also been aimed at provoking these very legal challenges, with the ultimate goal of addressing the question to the Supreme Court.",
      "\"It really was kind of a matter of time before a test case made its way to the court, where the court would have a chance to overrule Humphrey's,\" Joel Alicea, a law professor at the Catholic University of America, told CBS News.",
      "Alicea was referring to the Supreme Court's 1935 decision in the case Humphrey's Executor v. United States, in which the court carved out an exception to the president's power to remove executive officers. William Humphrey, appointed to a second term on the Federal Trade Commission by President Herbert Hoover, was asked to resign by President Franklin Roosevelt. The new president then fired him, citing their policy differences, rather than dismissing him for cause. The case is referred to a Humphrey's Executor because he died not long after his firing, but the executors of his estate brought the case to pursue his back pay.",
      "In Humphrey's Executor, the Supreme Court found that Congress could impose for-cause removal protections to multi-member commissions of experts that are balanced along partisan lines and do not exercise any executive power. The high court recognized another exception in 1988, which applies to certain inferior officers who have limited duties and lack policymaking or significant administrative authority.",
      "In recent years, though, the Supreme Court has chipped away at its 1935 ruling and reasserted the president's power to remove executive branch officers at will. Most notably in 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's structure of a single leader removable only for inefficiency, neglect or malfeasance is unconstitutional.",
      "\"In our constitutional system, the executive power belongs to the president, and that power generally includes the ability to supervise and remove the agents who wield executive power in his stead,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the court's conservative majority. \"While we have previously upheld limits on the president's removal authority in certain contexts, we decline to do so when it comes to principal officers who, acting alone, wield significant executive power.\"",
      "Now, nearly five years later, the high court is on track to revisit the issue of the president's removal power and could overturn the nearly century-old ruling allowing Congress to protect the members of independent agencies from being fired at will.",
      "In what is likely to be the Trump administration's first\u00a0Supreme Court\u00a0emergency appeal of his second term, the solicitor general is expected to ask the high court to\u00a0permit Dellinger's firing, according to documents obtained Sunday.",
      "Two justices, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, who was appointed by Mr. Trump, have already indicated that it's time for the Supreme Court to scrap its 1935 precedent.",
      "\"The decision in Humphrey's Executor poses a direct threat to our constitutional structure and, as a result, the liberty of the American people,\" Thomas wrote in a concurring opinion to its 2020 decision on the CFPB, which was joined by Gorsuch.",
      "Thomas, the longest-serving member of the court, said that in a future case, he \"would repudiate what is left of this erroneous precedent.\"",
      "Three more members of the court, Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Samuel Alito, all have experience working in the executive branch that could have shaped their views on executive power.",
      "\"This has nothing to do with the justices' ideological leanings or which president appointed them,\" Alicea said. \"This has to do with deeply held views about the nature of presidential removal under Article II of the Constitution, and these are views that some of these justices have had for decades.\"",
      "At least one of the officials fired by Mr. Trump recognized that she may be part of a broader plan to target the Supreme Court's 1935 ruling. Gwynne Wilcox, the chair of the National Labor Relations Board, received an email on behalf of the president on Jan. 27 informing her and the agency's general counsel that they had been \"removed from the office of members of the National Labor Relations Board.\"",
      "But the National Labor Relations Act, passed by Congress in 1935, restricts the reasons for removal of board members to \"neglect of duty or malfeasance in office,\" and requires that they receive \"notice and hearing.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's firing of Wilcox was a \"blatant violation\" of that law, she wrote in a lawsuit challenging her removal. But Wilcox also said that the president's action was \"apparently designed to test Congress's power to create independent agencies like the board.\"",
      "\"Although Ms. Wilcox has no desire to aid the president in establishing a test case, she is also cognizant of the fact that, if no challenge is made, the president will have effectively succeeded in rendering the NLRA's protections \u2014 and, by extension, that of other independent agencies \u2014 nugatory,\" her lawyers wrote.",
      "Citing Humphrey's Executor, Wilcox's legal team wrote that Congress has relied on that decision for decades when structuring independent agencies and warned that \"abandoning it now could cast a cloud over a wide variety of agency decision-making.\"",
      "But Alicea said that if Humphrey's Executor is reversed, it would bring these agencies under the direction of the president.",
      "\"The American people will have more control over their own government by having a president who they elect that superintends the entire federal bureaucracy, and I think that's a much better and much healthier constitutional structure than what we've had since the New Deal, where you have agencies that are largely insulated from direct presidential control and oversight, and therefore less politically accountable to the American people,\" he said.",
      "The Trump administration, too, has laid out its roadmap: It plans to urge the Supreme Court to overrule Humphrey's Executor.",
      "In a letter to Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, dated Wednesday, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris said the Justice Department believes certain for-cause removal provisions that apply to members of multi-member commissions are unconstitutional.",
      "The department, she wrote, will no longer defend the constitutionality of those provisions. Harris specifically pointed to the protections for members of three agencies that the Trump administration believes violate the Constitution: the Federal Trade Commission, the National Labor Relations Board and the Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "\"To the extent that Humphrey's Executor requires otherwise, the department intends to urge the Supreme Court to overrule that decision, which prevents the president from adequately supervising principal officers in the executive branch who execute the laws on the president's behalf, and which has already been severely eroded by recent Supreme Court decisions,\" Harris wrote.",
      "As acting solicitor general, Harris represents the federal government before the Supreme Court. Mr. Trump has nominated D. John Sauer, his former defense attorney, for the role but he has not yet been confirmed.",
      "Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said in response to Harris' letter that it's been the law of the land for decades that members of bipartisan, independent agencies are protected from removal by the president and can only be terminated for cause.",
      "\"But under President Trump, the Justice Department will no longer defend these duly-enacted laws and will instead push the Supreme Court to overturn a nearly-century-old Supreme Court precedent upholding the constitutionality of these statutes,\" he said in a statement. \"This is a striking reversal of the Justice Department's longstanding position under Republican and Democratic presidents alike, but not surprising from an administration that is only looking out for wealthy special interests \u2014 not the American people.\"",

    "summary": "Archaeologists in Egypt have found of the tomb of King Thutmose II - the first discovery of an ancient royal tomb since King Tutankhamun's in 1922.",
    "story": [
      "Egyptian officials announced Tuesday the discovery of the tomb of King Thutmose II, the last of the lost tombs of the kings of ancient Egypt's Eighteenth Dynasty, which reigned for over two centuries between about 1550 BC and 1292 BC. It's the first royal Egyptian tomb to be discovered since King Tutankhamun's final resting place was found in 1922.",
      "A joint Egyptian-British archaeological mission discovered Thutmose II's tomb in the mount of Thebes area, west of Luxor and the renowned Valley of the Kings. The team and the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, which made the announcement, said evidence was discovered that clearly indicates it was King Thutmose II's tomb during excavations of what had previously been known only as tomb No. C4.",
      "The entrance and main passage into the structure were discovered in 2022, and internal excavations have continued meticulously since then.",
      "Dr. Mohamed Ismail Khaled, Secretary-General of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, said when the mission first found the entrance to the tomb and its main passage almost three years ago, the team believed it could belong to one of the wives of the kings, given its proximity to the tomb of the wives of King Thutmose III and its proximity to the tomb of Queen Hatshepsut, which was prepared for her as a royal wife before she became ruler of the ancient kingdom. She ended up being buried in the Valley of the Kings, due to her ascent to the throne.",
      "As the excavation work and examination of artifacts continued, the mission found new evidence that identified the owner of the mysterious tomb as King Thutmose II, suggesting also that his burial rites were carried out by Queen Hatshepsut, who was his wife and half-sister.",
      "Khaled said parts of alabaster vessels found in the ruins have inscriptions bearing the name of King Thutmose II and identifying him as the \"deceased king,\" along with the name of his wife, Hatshepsut, all of which he said had helped to confirm Thutmose II as the owner of the tomb.",
      "He described the discovery as one of the most important archaeological finds in recent years. The artifacts discovered are important additions to the body of knowledge around the history of the area and the reign of King Thutmose II.",
      "The mummy of King Thutmose II was discovered during the 19th century, not far away at another archaeological site known as the Deir el-Bahari Cachette, to which the it was likely moved centuries after being looted by tomb raiders, according to the\u00a0relatively new National Museum\u00a0of Egyptian Civilization. His mummy is now on display, among those of other ancient royals, at the museum.",
      "The tomb is in a poor state of preservation due largely to exposure to floods shortly after Thutmose II's death, according to Mohamed Abdel Badie, Head of the Egyptian Antiquities Sector at the Supreme Council of Antiquities and Head of the Egyptian team that has worked on the dig. Abdel Badie said initial studies also indicate much of the original contents of the tomb were moved to another location after the ancient floods.",
      "He said the teams had discovered mortar in the tomb with remnants of blue inscriptions and yellow stars, and some paragraphs from the book of \"Imydwat,\" which is one of the most important funerary books found in ancient Egyptian tombs, written to help guide the late royals through their underworld journey.",
      "Dr. Piers Litherland, head of the English team at the site, said the tomb is characterized by a simple architectural design typical of those chosen by the successive rulers of Egypt who came after Thutmose II.",
      "Litherland said the mission would continue its survey work and try to determine where the rest of the contents from Thutmose II's tomb were relocated to, and to uncover any further secrets that may have been locked beneath the earth for millennia.",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Feb 2025 10:42:43 -0500",
    "summary": "Human brains contain higher concentrations of microplastics than other organs, according to a new study, and the amount appears to be increasing over time.",
    "story": [
      "Human brains contain higher concentrations of microplastics than other organs, according to a new study, and the amount appears to be increasing over time.",
      "In the study, published in early February in the journal\u00a0Nature Medicine, University of New Mexico Health Sciences researchers found microplastics in human brains have increased 50% over the past 8 years. They also found that people with dementia had up to 10 times as much plastic in their brains as everyone else.",
      "Microplastics are tiny fragments of degraded polymers that are found in the environment, including our air, water and soil, a news release explained. Previous studies have already shown these substances have made their way into the human body.",
      "The lead researcher, toxicologist Matthew Campen, said the rate of accumulation they found mirrors the increasing amounts of plastics waste on the planet. And he said in the news release that their findings should trigger alarm about the potential impact on human health.",
      "\"I have yet to encounter a single human being who says, 'There's a bunch of plastic in my brain and I'm totally cool with that,'\" he said.",
      "The study compared liver, kidney and brain tissue samples from autopsies conducted in 2016 and 2024, and found \"substantially higher concentrations\" in the 2024 brain tissue. The researchers also conducted similar analysis on older and more recent autopsies for people who died with confirmed dementia diagnoses, and found \"far greater\" concentrations.",
      "While it's unclear how particles are actually being transported into the brain, Campen said the size of the micro- and nanoplastics, measuring 200 nanometers or less, are not much larger than viruses and therefore small enough to cross the blood-brain barrier.",
      "In the study, researchers detected 12 different polymers, the most common of which was polyethylene, widely used for packaging and containers, including bottles and cups, the release noted.",
      "Campen suspects most microplastics in the body are ingested through food, particularly meat.",
      "\"The way we irrigate fields with plastic-contaminated water, we postulate that the plastics build up there,\" he said. \"We feed those crops to our livestock. We take the manure and put it back on the field, so there may be a sort of feed-forward biomagnification.\"",
      "The team also found high concentrations of plastic in meat bought at grocery stores.",
      "As for the higher levels found in the brains of dementia patients, the researchers noted the study was not designed to prove whether that was the cause of symptoms \u2014 it may be the reverse, that the disease process allows more accumulation to happen.",
      "\"Atrophy of brain tissue, impaired blood\u2013brain barrier integrity and poor clearance mechanisms are hallmarks of dementia and would be anticipated to increase [micro- and nanoplastic] concentrations,\" they wrote.",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said the research on the health impact of microplastics is still in its infancy, but there are important questions being asked.",
      "\"There are concerns that this could be causing any number of conditions. Could it be increasing the risk of stroke or heart attack? Could it be increasing the risk of cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, infertility?\" she said\u00a0on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "For those looking to reduce exposure to microplastics, Gounder suggests switching from plastic bottles to stainless steel or glass and making some other changes in the kitchen.",
      "\"Do not reheat your food in contact with plastic \u2014 that is really important. So move it to a glass dish or your plate, not in plastic,\" she said \"And then finally switch out your cutting boards. Don't use plastic cutting boards, use either wood or stone.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 16:57:34 -0500",
    "summary": "The head of planetary defense at the European Space Agency discusses 2024 YR4, an asteroid with a small chance of striking Earth eight years from now.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid capable of flattening a mid-sized city could potentially collide with Earth eight years from now, as its orbit around the sun briefly intersects the path of our planet. Named 2024 YR4, the space rock carries with it very slim odds of striking land \u2014 either on Earth or, even less likely, the moon \u2014 and astronomers have so far set the probability of a crash at around 2%.",
      "International space organizations like NASA are taking the possible threat seriously, however small it might be. Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's planetary defense office, said their attentiveness shouldn't unduly raise public concern. He shared key facts about the asteroid with CBS News during the below conversation,\u00a0 which has been edited for clarity.",
      "When would the asteroid hit Earth?",
      "This asteroid passes us by every four years. Every time we go four times around the sun, it has almost precisely completed one turn. It has just recently had a flyby in December 2024, which means the next flyby is in December 2028, and we know already that this one is no problem.",
      "The critical one is in 2032, on the 22nd of December, somewhere around the middle of the day in Universal Time. That is when the asteroid is passing, really, through a part of the orbit of the Earth. So, it's really going through the path of Earth, so to speak.",
      "And the question is, whether Earth will be there at this point in time, or whether it will have already passed or is still approaching that point. It's the question, where will it pass by? There's an uncertainty region that spans, right now, the entire Earth-Moon system \u2014 which is not to say that we don't know a lot about it. In fact, we know a lot about it.",
      "Now, we're looking at a closing moment in time on the 22nd of December, 2032, and the question is about fractions of a meter per second, which will make all the difference.",
      "There's about a 20-something-minute window in which the Earth can be in the way of this before it's no longer in the path of the asteroid, or the asteroid cannot come in contact with the Earth anymore.",
      "How is the asteroid risk being managed?",
      "Until recently, we did daily measurements with different telescopes. Then, we had to pause a little bit for one or two days because of the full moon, and the object being too close to the full moon, and the moon illuminating the sky too much to see it.",
      "From now on, we will not monitor it daily, but it will be constantly monitored in the best way possible, with ever larger telescopes. And the idea is to measure its path around the sun in ever higher positions, so you will see this uncertainty region shrink, and shrink, and shrink. And we are trying to constrain the uncertainty so much that we can say whether it passes by Earth safely, or whether there is still some chance left in the middle of April.",
      "What happens in April?",
      "We will be so far away from the object that we cannot observe it from Earth anymore. And then, the James Webb Telescope will take measurements. It will actually take one in March, primarily infrared observations that give us more insight about the size of the object, and then one more in May to do additional measurements. The most likely scenario is that, by that time, you will be able to say, look, we can prove it's not going to hit Earth, but there is a chance that we cannot eliminate it completely. And that will be the more interesting bit, because then we have to wait until mid-2028, when we can observe it again. We will not let that time pass by without action.",
      "When was the last time an asteroid had similar odds of hitting Earth?",
      "This is only the second time that impact prediction systems have rated any asteroid with an impact probability of more than 1%. The last time was about 20 years ago, with the asteroid Apophis in 2004, which reached a couple of percent for a brief period in time before the uncertainty region could be constrained.",
      "That shows how unusual 1% is, and that means that we, as experts, have to take this seriously. However, with the current probability estimated at around 2%, it's still around 98% likely that nothing bad will happen at all. So, that needs to be kept in mind all the time. This is something that merits attention, but it's not perceived as an imminent threat. It's just, we need to find out more about it.",
      "Have asteroids this size actually crashed into Earth?",
      "We are aware of a recent example in history where this has happened. It was 1908 in Siberia. There was an event where 2,000 square kilometers of forest had been flattened by a big explosion, high up in the atmosphere. And this is very consistent with a body about 50 meters in diameter, plus or minus 10 meters, entering Earth's atmosphere.",
      "The body itself was, then, likely not a solid piece of rock. It was more like, what we call a pile of smaller pieces of rock. And this burst several kilometers above the surface and had this effect, that 2,000 square kilometers of forest was flattened, that seismic waves went out from this and could be detected far away, that people witnessed this event, also from very far away.",
      "We don't know if anyone was hurt in that accident. Nothing is reported. But the size, the footprint of the destruction is comparable to a major urban area, or a big city on Earth. So, this is basically the scenario that we would expect from this.",
      "Another example not recorded in human history was an object believed to have been about 50 meters in diameter, a massive chunk of iron that formed the Barringer meteor crater in Arizona. It's a 1.2-kilometer crater. If you look at this and think about it, if that were to hit in a city, the city would look very, very different afterward.",
      "The estimated size of this asteroid ranges from about 40 to 90 meters. Wouldn't there also be a big difference between the damage caused by something 40 meters wide versus 90 meters?",
      "Absolutely. I mean, the 40 to 90 meters is a standard estimate, because we cannot know at this point in time what the surface brightness is. Current data indicate it's more toward the 40- or 50-meter size. So, luckily, on the smaller size range, which is why I cited these popular examples for this.",
      "But, indeed, size matters for asteroids. Size matters a lot. If we're talking about the doubling of the radius of an asteroid, that means eight times the mass, eight times the energy, and that is a significant difference, of course. While on the lower end of the scale, with about 40 meters, it would be threatening to, let's say, a middle-sized city, on the 90-meter edge, it might be comparable to the biggest urban areas.",
      "Why has the probability of 2024 YR4 hitting Earth increased since it was first discovered?",
      "The good news is, this increase does not mean that the asteroid has become more dangerous. The path of the asteroid is defined by physical laws. It's already clear. It's just our knowledge of where that path would be, in reality, is not perfect yet.",
      "The percentage can be compared to the size of the uncertainty area, compared with the size of the Earth. If you look at the fraction, the size of the Earth \u2014   which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014   is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness.",
      "Since then, the size of the uncertainty region has basically shrunk by half. And the size of Earth, luckily, remains the same. So, that means Earth is now occupying twice the amount of space in the uncertainty region. And it means our estimate for the impact risk has risen from 1% to 2%. It doesn't mean that anything has changed.",
      "Again, 2% is a 98% chance of missing. So what will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further, and the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.",
      "In the case of this being a close flyby to Earth, if it's reasonably close, it's entirely possible that the impact probability will continue to rise a little bit on a modest path. This is still no cause for alarm.",
      "The asteroid has been assigned a Level 3 ranking, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale. How uncommon is that?",
      "It's the first time ever that an object is officially classified as a Level 3 on the Torino scale. The only other object that was ever classified with a level higher than 1 was Apophis. Because of its larger size, Apophis has been classified as a 4 on the Torino scale, which is really just indicating that it's a larger object. [Apophis has an estimated diameter of 350 meters, which is much larger than the asteroid 2024 YR4.]",
      "What else should people know?",
      "Well, the most important thing is, don't panic. Always good advice, but it's definitely applicable advice in this situation. I think this gives us a chance to prove that we, as a planet, can still rise above things on Earth that are between people, between countries, between parts of Earth. That if we are facing a completely outside threat, that we can all come together, join forces and face these kinds of threats together.",
      "This one is a manageable challenge. Even if it were to be headed towards Earth, which is by no means certain, 98% it's clear that it will miss us. So, not much to be afraid of, but a good chance to show that we can stand united on this planet.",

    "summary": "The head of planetary defense at the European Space Agency discusses 2024 YR4, an asteroid with a small chance of striking Earth eight years from now.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid capable of flattening a mid-sized city could potentially collide with Earth eight years from now, as its orbit around the sun briefly intersects the path of our planet. Named 2024 YR4, the space rock carries with it very slim odds of striking land \u2014 either on Earth or, even less likely, the moon \u2014 and astronomers have so far set the probability of a crash at around 2%.",
      "International space organizations like NASA are taking the possible threat seriously, however small it might be. Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's planetary defense office, said their attentiveness shouldn't unduly raise public concern. He shared key facts about the asteroid with CBS News during the below conversation,\u00a0 which has been edited for clarity.",
      "When would the asteroid hit Earth?",
      "This asteroid passes us by every four years. Every time we go four times around the sun, it has almost precisely completed one turn. It has just recently had a flyby in December 2024, which means the next flyby is in December 2028, and we know already that this one is no problem.",
      "The critical one is in 2032, on the 22nd of December, somewhere around the middle of the day in Universal Time. That is when the asteroid is passing, really, through a part of the orbit of the Earth. So, it's really going through the path of Earth, so to speak.",
      "And the question is, whether Earth will be there at this point in time, or whether it will have already passed or is still approaching that point. It's the question, where will it pass by? There's an uncertainty region that spans, right now, the entire Earth-Moon system \u2014 which is not to say that we don't know a lot about it. In fact, we know a lot about it.",
      "Now, we're looking at a closing moment in time on the 22nd of December, 2032, and the question is about fractions of a meter per second, which will make all the difference.",
      "There's about a 20-something-minute window in which the Earth can be in the way of this before it's no longer in the path of the asteroid, or the asteroid cannot come in contact with the Earth anymore.",
      "How is the asteroid risk being managed?",
      "Until recently, we did daily measurements with different telescopes. Then, we had to pause a little bit for one or two days because of the full moon, and the object being too close to the full moon, and the moon illuminating the sky too much to see it.",
      "From now on, we will not monitor it daily, but it will be constantly monitored in the best way possible, with ever larger telescopes. And the idea is to measure its path around the sun in ever higher positions, so you will see this uncertainty region shrink, and shrink, and shrink. And we are trying to constrain the uncertainty so much that we can say whether it passes by Earth safely, or whether there is still some chance left in the middle of April.",
      "What happens in April?",
      "We will be so far away from the object that we cannot observe it from Earth anymore. And then, the James Webb Telescope will take measurements. It will actually take one in March, primarily infrared observations that give us more insight about the size of the object, and then one more in May to do additional measurements. The most likely scenario is that, by that time, you will be able to say, look, we can prove it's not going to hit Earth, but there is a chance that we cannot eliminate it completely. And that will be the more interesting bit, because then we have to wait until mid-2028, when we can observe it again. We will not let that time pass by without action.",

      "One such deepfake image of Cosgrove that was still up over the weekend had been shared by an account with 2.8 million followers.",
      "The two actors \u2014 both former child stars on the Nickelodeon show \"iCarly,\" which is owned by CBS News' parent company Paramount Global \u2014 are the most prolifically targeted for deepfake content, based on the images of public figures that CBS News has analyzed.",
      "Meta's Oversight Board, a quasi-independent body that consists of experts in the field of human rights and freedom of speech, and makes recommendations for content moderation on Meta's platforms, told CBS News in an emailed statement that the company's current regulations around sexualized deepfake content are insufficient.",
      "The Oversight Board cited recommendations it has made to Meta over the past year,\u00a0 including urging the company to make its rules clearer by updating its prohibition against \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" to specifically include the word \"non-consensual\" and to encompass other photo manipulation techniques such as AI.",
      "The board has also recommended that Meta fold its ban on \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" into the company's Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations, so moderation of such content would be more rigorously enforced.",
      "Asked Monday by CBS News about the board's recommendations, Meta pointed to the guidelines on its transparency website, which show the company is assessing the feasibility of three of four recommendations from the oversight board and is implementing one of its suggestions, though Meta noted in its statement on its site that it is currently ruling out changing the language of its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to include the phrase \"non consensual.\" Meta also says it is currently unlikely   to move its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to within its Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations.",
      "Meta noted in its statement that it was still considering ways to signal a lack of consent in AI-generated images. Meta also said it was considering reforms to its Adult Sexual Exploitation policies, to \"capture the spirit\" of the board's recommendations.",
      "\"The Oversight Board has made clear that non-consensual deepfake intimate images are a serious violation of privacy and personal dignity, disproportionately harming women and girls. These images are not just a misuse of technology \u2014 they are a form of abuse that can have lasting consequences,\" Michael McConnell, an Oversight Board co-chair, told CBS News on Friday.",
      "\"The Board is actively monitoring Meta's response and will continue to push for stronger safeguards, faster enforcement, and greater accountability,\" McConnell said.",
      "Meta is not the only social media company to face the issue of widespread, sexualized deepfake content.",
      "Last year, Elon Musk's platform X temporarily blocked Taylor Swift-related searches after AI-generated fake pornographic images in the likeness of the singer circulated widely on the platform and garnered millions of views and impressions.",
      "\"Posting Non-Consensual Nudity (NCN) images is strictly prohibited on X and we have a zero-tolerance policy towards such content,\" the platform's safety team said in a post at the time.",
      "A study published earlier this month by the U.K. government found the number of deepfake images on social media platforms expanding at a rapid rate, with the government projecting that 8 million deepfakes would be shared this year, up from 500,000 in 2023.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 05:00:05 -0500",
    "summary": "Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes or disabilities, touches millions of Americans and has become deeply woven into the U.S. health care system.",
    "story": [
      "In January, during\u00a0a congressional hearing on his way to becoming secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. got basic details wrong about Medicaid \u2014 a program he now oversees.",
      "He said that Medicaid is fully funded by the federal government (it's not) and that many enrollees are unsatisfied with high out-of-pocket costs (enrollees pay limited, if any, out-of-pocket costs).",
      "Medicaid\u00a0is complex. The\u00a0$880 billion-a-year\u00a0state-federal program offers health coverage to millions of disabled and low-income Americans. The program covers different services for different people in different parts of the country \u2014 and enrollees may interact with private insurance companies without \"Medicaid\" in their names, leaving some unaware that they're on the program at all.",
      "Although President Donald Trump\u00a0promised to \"love and cherish\" Medicaid, Republicans in Congress last week announced federal budget proposals that could dramatically curtail the program. As that debate begins, here is what you need to know about Medicaid.",
      "What is Medicaid, and how is it different from Medicare?",
      "Medicaid and Medicare were created by the same legislation \u2014 an addition to the Social Security Act \u2014 that was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965.",
      "Medicaid is a government health insurance program for people with low incomes and adults and children with disabilities.",
      "Medicare, by contrast, generally covers those\u00a065 or older.",
      "For older Americans with low incomes, Medicaid covers out-of-pocket costs for Medicare. Such people are commonly called \"dual eligibles,\" because they qualify for both programs.",
      "Who is on Medicaid?",
      "More than 79 million people receive services from Medicaid or the closely related Children's Health Insurance Program. That represents about 20% of the total population of the United States. Most enrollees qualify because of low incomes.",
      "About 40% of all children in the country are covered by Medicaid or CHIP, created in 1997. Both pay for services such as routine checkups, vaccinations, and hospital stays. Medicaid also covers pregnant people before and after they give birth and pays for more than 40% of all births.",
      "Medicaid also covers people with disabilities or complex medical needs and helps them afford services that allow them to live independently in community settings, outside of institutions such as nursing homes and state-run hospitals.",
      "The program serves a diverse cross section of the country. About 40% of people under 65 who use Medicaid are white, 30% are Hispanic, 19% are Black, and 1% are Indigenous people.",
      "Federal Medicaid dollars cannot be used to cover immigrants who are in the U.S. without legal permission, though some states, as well as Washington, D.C.,\u00a0have used their own funds\u00a0to extend Medicaid coverage to such individuals. California was the first state to do so.",
      "What are the income qualifications?",
      "Eligibility generally depends on whether a person is low income, and states have different ways of defining that. For a four-adult household without dependent children, the current national median coverage level is $44,367.",
      "The Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare, which passed in 2010, allowed more people to qualify for Medicaid on the basis of income. This is what is known as \"Medicaid expansion.\"",
      "The law offered states a sizable incentive to add more people to their programs: The federal government would pitch in more money per enrollee to help cover them.",
      "The intention behind the expansion was to close gaps in health insurance programs for the millions of Americans who don't get coverage through an employer. Medicaid would cover people with extremely low incomes, and as their incomes rose, they could move to subsidized health plans sold through the Affordable Care Act's exchanges.",
      "In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court said the decision of whether to expand the program would be\u00a0left up to individual states. Today, 40 states and the District of Columbia \u2014 led by Democrats and Republicans alike \u2014 have opted in.",
      "In the\u00a010 states that haven't expanded\u00a0Medicaid to more low-income adults, the median earnings qualification level is $5,947 a year for a single-person household in 2025. Those who make more are not eligible.",
      "Adults in those states who make too much for Medicaid can also make too little to qualify for help buying plans on the Affordable Care Act exchanges, leaving some unable to afford coverage. An estimated 1.5 million fall into this coverage gap.",
      "Where does the money to pay for it come from?",
      "The federal government pays most of the cost of Medicaid by matching a portion of what states spend.",
      "Currently, the federal government matches at least 50% of state spending and offers states more money for some services and enrollees \u2014 for instance, for children and pregnant women.",
      "Less wealthy states \u2014 determined by considering residents' per capita incomes \u2014 receive a higher match, translating to a higher percentage of federal dollars. In Mississippi, for instance, the federal government picks up\u00a077% of the cost\u00a0of Medicaid.",
      "States also receive a 90% match from the federal government for enrollees eligible for Medicaid under the ACA's expansion.",
      "There is no limit on how much states can spend on the program, and hundreds of billions of federal dollars flow into states each year. In 2023, states\u00a0spent about 15%\u00a0of their own budgets on Medicaid.",
      "What does that money pay for?",
      "Federal law requires all state Medicaid programs to cover certain services, including emergency medical transportation, X-rays and lab work, family planning, and medication-assisted treatment for people with opioid use disorder. The program also covers many nursing and home health services, though federal law allows those benefits\u00a0to be clawed back\u00a0after an enrollee's death.",
      "Beyond that, states have the flexibility to choose the services their Medicaid programs cover. All states cover prescription drugs, and most cover eyeglasses, some dental care, and physical therapy.",
      "Medicaid covers more mental health and long-term care services than any other type of insurance, public or private.",
      "What is Medicaid called in my state?",
      "Medicaid programs can go by\u00a0many different names, even within the same state, in part because most states use private insurance companies to run them. This can be confusing for consumers who may not realize they are actually enrolled in Medicaid.",
      "In\u00a0New York, for instance, Medicaid plans are offered by major companies, such as Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield and UnitedHealthcare \u2014 and some you may not have heard of, such as Amida Care and MetroPlusHealth. In Wisconsin, enrollees may be in BadgerCare Plus; in Connecticut, Husky Health; in Texas, STAR; and in California, Medi-Cal.",
      "How does Medicaid affect hospitals and doctors in my state?",
      "Medicaid generally pays health care providers such as doctors and hospitals less money for services than Medicare or private insurance does. But it can be more money than they'd get caring for people who are uninsured \u2014 and without Medicaid, many more Americans would be uninsured.",
      "Like states, providers and hospitals have come to rely on this money and express concerns that even phasing it out over time would require major adjustments.",
      "What's going to happen to Medicaid?",
      "It's not clear. Republicans in Washington are again pushing for major changes, which could take the form of cuts to federal funding. That could reduce the number of people who qualify, the services available, or both. A similar push focused on repealing and replacing Obamacare in 2017, during Trump's first term, was unsuccessful.",
      "Perhaps one of the biggest obstacles to changing Medicaid is\u00a0its popularity: 77% of Americans \u2014 and majorities of Democrats, independents, and Republicans \u2014 view the program favorably.",
      "At the heart of it all are key questions about the role of government in people's health: How big should the U.S. medical insurance safety net be? Who deserves government assistance? And how will enrollees, states, providers, and the health care system at large absorb major changes to Medicaid, even if a rollout were staggered?",

    "summary": "The move threatens to cast a cloud of uncertainty over many migrants who applying for immigration benefits that would allow them to stay in the U.S. legally and, in some cases, permanently.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has enacted a pause on all immigration applications filed by migrants from Latin America and Ukraine allowed into the U.S. under certain Biden-era programs, citing fraud and security concerns, according to two U.S. officials and an internal memo obtained by CBS News.",
      "The application freeze will remain in place indefinitely while government officials work to identify potential cases of fraud and enhance vetting procedures to mitigate concerns related to national security and public safety, according to the directive.",
      "The move, which had not been previously reported, threatens to cast a cloud of uncertainty over many migrants who were in the process of applying for various immigration benefits that would allow them to stay in the U.S. legally and, in some cases, permanently.",
      "While the exact number of affected migrants is unclear, the hold on applications applies to several Biden administration programs that allowed hundreds of thousands of foreigners to come to the U.S. legally through an immigration law known as parole. That law empowers the U.S. government to welcome foreigners quickly on humanitarian or public benefit grounds.",
      "The Biden administration used parole at an unprecedented scale, partially to encourage migrants to sign up for legal migration channels instead of crossing the southern border unlawfully. The Trump administration moved swiftly to suspend those efforts, arguing that they abused the parole authority.",
      "The Trump administration had previously halted new entries under Biden-era parole policies. But in a memo dated Feb. 14, Andrew Davidson, a top U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services official, ordered an agency-wide \"administrative pause\" on all \"pending benefit requests\" filed by migrants already allowed into the U.S. under three Biden administration programs.",
      "They include a policy, called Uniting for Ukraine, set up to offer a safe haven to those fleeing the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Roughly 240,000 Ukrainians with American sponsors arrived in the U.S. under that process before President Trump took office. Another affected program, known as CHNV, allowed 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans sponsored by American citizens to enter the U.S.",
      "The third impacted program consists of processes that permitted some Colombians, Ecuadorians, Central Americans, Haitians and Cubans with American relatives to come to the U.S. to wait for a family-based green card to become available.",
      "Because those allowed into the U.S. under these programs were only given temporary work permits and deportation protections that typically last for two years, many of them applied for other immigration benefits, lawyers and experts said.",
      "Those benefits include a program known as Temporary Protected Status for migrants from crisis-stricken countries like Haiti, Ukraine and Venezuela; asylum, which allows those fleeing persecution to gain a permanent safe haven in the U.S.; and green cards, or permanent American residency. Because of a Cold War-era law, Cubans paroled into the U.S. are eligible to apply for green cards.",
      "But under the internal USCIS directive, officials will no longer be able to process any applications for these programs or any other benefit if the requests were filed by migrants who arrived in the U.S. under the targeted Biden administration policies.",
      "\"This effectively freezes their ability to move into another legal status,\" said Lynden Melded, who served as the top lawyer at USCIS during the administration of former President George W. Bush and now works as a partner at Berry Appleman & Leiden LLP. \"In the interim, they would remain susceptible to removal from the country if the government terminates their parole status.\"",
      "The USCIS memo said the move is justified because \"[c]urrently, fraud information and public safety or national security concerns are not being properly flagged in USCIS' adjudicative systems.\" The directive cites the Biden administration's move last year to temporarily pause the parole initiative for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans due to fraud concerns.",
      "In his memo, Davidson referenced investigations that he said found thousands of CHNV applications with \"serial sponsors,\" information of deceased individuals or identical addresses. He said some of those cases were proven to be fraud. Davidson also said some migrants allowed into the U.S. under CHNV \"were not fully vetted.\"",

    "story": [
      "A woman who gave birth to a baby boy that wasn't hers due to an embryo transfer mix-up filed a lawsuit Tuesday against a fertility clinic in Georgia after she was forced to give up the 5-month-old infant.",
      "Krystena Murray, a White woman, realized something went wrong at the Coastal Fertility Specialists clinic in May 2023 when she delivered a baby that did not match the appearance of the sperm donor she had chosen who looked similar to her with dirty blonde hair and blue eyes.",
      "Instead, on Dec. 29, 2023, she delivered a baby who was Black. Murray said she didn't know what to do but take care of the baby, including breast-feeding him, taking him to doctor's appointments and cuddling him throughout the day.",
      "But the following months were full of anxiety for the new mom, attorney Adam Wolf\u00a0said. Murray never posted photos of the child online or allowed her friends and family to see him. She eventually purchased an at-home DNA kit, and the test results she received in late January 2024 confirmed what she already knew, according to the complaint against Dr. Jeffrey Gray and Coastal Fertility.",
      "On Feb. 5, 2024, Murray reached out to the fertility clinic who later informed the biological parents of the baby about what happened, according to the complaint. The baby boy was 3 months old when the couple, who lived in another state, sued Murray for custody.",
      "\"To carry a baby, fall in love with him, deliver him, and build the uniquely special bond between mother and baby, all to have him taken away. I'll never fully recover from this,\" Murray said through her attorney.",
      "Murray voluntarily gave up custody of the boy in May 2024 after her family-law counsel concluded that she was going to lose the custody battle, the complaint said. She said she hasn't seen the baby since. Murray is seeking a jury trial, $75,000 in judgment and other damages, according to the lawsuit.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Coastal Fertility Specialists acknowledged the mistake and apologized for the distress that was caused.",
      "\"This was an isolated event with no further patients affected. The same day this error was discovered we immediately conducted an in-depth review and put additional safeguards in place to further protect patients and to ensure that such an incident does not happen again,\" the statement read in part.",
      "As the popularity of fertility treatments like IVF continue to rise across the U.S. \u2014 up 33% from 2018 to 2023, according to a Pew Research Center survey \u2014 lawsuits like Murray's also began to emerge.",
      "In New York, a couple said a fertility center transferred their embryo to another customer, a complete stranger, who then gave birth to their son, along with another couple's baby. In 2023, a couple in Texas sued a fertility clinic for using the wrong sperm in an IVF procedure. In California, a same-sex couple sued a fertilization clinic, claiming that their hopes of having a son were hampered after a female embryo was wrongly implanted in their surrogate.",

      "Passengers are starting to share their stories of surviving\u00a0a chilling crash-landing Monday at Toronto Pearson International Airport, where a Delta plane on a flight from Minneapolis caught fire and flipped upside down on the runway.",
      "There were 80 people on board Flight 4819 \u2014 76 passengers and four crew members \u2014 all of whom survived. Authorities said 21 people were injured. Two of the injured passengers, a 40-year-old woman and 60-year-old man, were initially said to be critically hurt and were airlifted to a hospital, while the others' injuries were considered mild to moderate, according to a regional paramedics service that responded to the scene. Delta said two people remained hospitalized Tuesday, CBS News Minnesota reported.",
      "One of the passengers speaking out about his experience is Pete Carlson, who boarded the plane Monday morning at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport to attend a paramedics conference in Canada.",
      "In an interview with Canadian broadcaster CBC News, Carlson recalled the sounds of \"cement and metal\" and the scent of gasoline as the plane skidded down the icy runway in Toronto, losing both wings and its tail and turning over completely so its wheels faced the sky.",
      "\"As we made our descent and made touchdown, it was just a very forceful event, where all of a sudden everything just kind of went sideways,\" Carlson told CBC News. \"And then, next thing I know, it was kind of a blink and I'm upside down, still strapped in.\"",
      "Carlson had fastened his seatbelt, as instructed, prior to landing. When he unlatched the belt to evacuate the plane, he said he \"crashed down onto the ceiling, which had become the floor.\"",
      "Emergency workers at the airport were able to reach the site of the crash \"within minutes,\" said Deborah Flint, president and CEO of Toronto Pearson International Airport, at a news conference Monday night. They quickly helped evacuate everyone on board. Flint said 22 of the passengers were Canadian and the rest were multinational, but did not provide details on how many were American or other nationalities.",
      "\"The most powerful part of today was, there was just people. No countries, no nothing,\" Carlson said. \"There was just people together helping each other.\"",
      "Another passenger, John Nelson, captured video of the plane, charred and overturned, as people climbed out of it into the freezing cold.",
      "Nelson described the plane making a hard landing before screeching over the pavement on its side and ultimately flipping onto its back,\u00a0CBS News Minnesota\u00a0reported.",
      "\"There was, like, a big fireball outside the left side of the plane and when we got finished we were upside down, everybody else was there as well,\" Nelson said. \"We tried to get out of there as quickly as possible.\"",
      "Several additional videos emerged online as passengers began to film the evacuation. In one video shared on Snapchat, passenger Ashley Zook appeared to dangle upside down from her seat inside the plane with her seatbelt fastened, AFP reported. The crash seemed to have knocked out the lights inside the plane, and it was dark.",
      "That same social media video showed harsh winds whipping past Zook after she exited the plane.",
      "\"I was just in a plane crash, oh my god,\" she said in the video.",
      "Another passenger, skier and sports influencer Pete Koukov, shared another video of the crash-landing on Instagram. A flight attendant wearing an Endeavor Air uniform is seen helping people evacuate the plane one by one through an emergency exit door, which Koukov climbed through himself. Endeavor Air is a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines headquartered in Minneapolis.",
      "The flight attendant can be heard directing passengers to \"drop everything\" and urging them to \"come on.\"",
      "\"Holy f***!\" Koukov repeatedly exclaims in the recording after getting of the plane. His Instagram post includes the message: \"Being alive feels pretty cool today.\"",
      "Koukov later told CNN that \"we were upside down hanging like bats\" inside the plane before evacuating. He said he \"didn't know anything was the matter\" until the plane hit the ground.",
      "The crash is under investigation by the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, which confirmed it is leading the probe. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration said they would send investigators as well.",
      "Meteorologists said there was blowing snow in Toronto when the crash happened, and visibility was down to 6 miles. Winds were gusting up to 37 mph and temperatures were well below freezing, at 17 degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "But Toronto Pearson International Airport Fire Chief Todd Aitken said Monday night that the runway was dry at the time of the crash, and there were no crosswind conditions. Flint said two runways at the Toronto airport would remain closed for at least part of Tuesday as the investigation continued.",

    "story": [
      "The Senate confirmed wealthy financier Howard Lutnick as commerce secretary Tuesday, putting in place a staunch supporter of President Trump's hardline trade policies.",
      "At the Commerce Department, Lutnick, who was CEO at the investment firm Cantor Fitzgerald, will oversee 50,000 employees who do everything from collecting economic statistics to running the census to issuing weather reports. But he's likely to spend a lot of time \u2014 along with Jamieson Greer, Mr. Trump's nominee to be the top U.S. trade negotiator \u2014 managing the president's aggressive plans to impose import taxes on U.S. trading partners, including allies and adversaries alike.",
      "The Senate vote to confirm Lutnick was 51-45.",
      "Mr. Trump views the tariffs as a versatile economic tool. They can raise money to finance his tax cuts elsewhere, protect U.S. industries and pressure other countries into making concessions on such issues as their own trade barriers, immigration and drug trafficking. Mainstream economists mostly view tariffs as counterproductive: They are paid by import companies in the United States, which try to pass along the higher costs to consumers and can thereby add to inflationary pressures throughout the economy.",
      "At his confirmation hearing last month, Lutnick dismissed as \"nonsense'' the idea that tariffs contribute to inflation. He expressed support for deploying across-the-board tariffs \"country by country'' to strong-arm other countries into lowering barriers to American exports.",
      "Mr. Trump last week announced plans for \"reciprocal'' tariffs \u2014 raising U.S. import tax rates to match the higher taxes that other countries impose on goods from the U.S. The move would shatter the rules that have governed world trade for decades. Since the 1960s, tariff rates have mostly emerged from negotiations between dozens of countries. Mr. Trump is commandeering the process.",
      "The president has also imposed 10% tariffs on Chinese imports and effectively raised U.S. taxes on foreign steel and aluminum. He has threatened \u2014 and delayed until March 4 \u2014 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico.",
      "Lutnick was CEO at Cantor Fitzgerald when its offices were hit in the Sept. 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center.

Howard Lutnick led the firm's recovery and is a member of the Board of Directors of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum.",

    "summary": "\"Everyone is hailing him as a hero and he is not a hero. He is a violent, violent man,\" says a woman whose former partner was pardoned.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump issued sweeping pardons to some 1,500 Jan. 6 defendants on his first day in office, his action did not distinguish between those who peacefully wandered the Capitol grounds four years earlier and those who engaged in violence against police.",
      "Now, critics of the move are raising concerns about the dangers posed by some of those convicted of violent felonies who have been released with no plan, and none of the monitoring or restrictions that typically accompany a more traditional parole process.",
      "\"I'm just afraid that I'm going to come home from work one night and he's going to be right there. He's going to be right there sitting on my porch,\" said Shantelle Holeton, a 43-year-old factory worker who says she voted for Trump three times.",
      "Holeton, who spoke with CBS exclusively, said she was abused by Jan. 6 defendant Peter Schwartz in 2019. He was charged and convicted for threatening her.",
      "Then in 2023, a federal judge handed Schwartz one of the longest sentences of any Capitol riot defendant \u2014 more than 14 years in prison on charges that included four counts of assaulting police officers.",
      "Body camera footage from Capitol Hill police during the riot show Schwartz spraying officers with pepper spray and wielding a baton. In court filings, the Department of Justice said he threw the first chair at officers, creating an opening that enabled hundreds of rioters to push back police lines.",
      "Federal prosecutors described Schwartz as \"one of the most violent and aggressive participants in the January 6, 2021 attack on the United States Capitol,\" and as someone who \"has a long history of assaulting police officers and women.\"",
      "Prior to the events of Jan. 6, 2021, Schwartz had amassed a lengthy criminal record that included previous clashes with police. CBS News reviewed dozens of Schwartz' convictions in more than four states for crimes including domestic violence, threatening his girlfriend, and assaulting security officers.",
      "CBS News made repeated efforts to contact Schwartz through his defense lawyer, known associates and family members. He did not respond to requests for comment.\u00a0 He has appeared in public proclaiming his innocence from the charges that led to his Jan. 6 conviction.",
      "\"A lot of us that were Jan. Sixers were actually innocent,\" Schwartz claimed in an interview with right-wing influencer Christopher Key, days after being released from prison.",
      "Speaking about the mass pardons of Jan 6 rioters during a press conference on Air Force One last week, President Trump said, \"what I did was a great thing for humanity. They were treated very, very unfairly.\"",
      "The White House would not say whether anyone had reviewed Schwartz's case before issuing him a pardon.",
      "\"President Trump campaigned on pardoning January 6th protestors, won the election with an overwhelming mandate, and delivered on his promise,\" said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Dozens of defendants with criminal histories",
      "Since Trump's mass pardon on Jan. 20, several defendants have had incidents with law enforcement or other legal troubles. Matthew Huttle, who was sentenced to six months in prison for his actions at the Capitol, was killed by a police officer while resisting arrest during a traffic stop in Indiana last month. Elizabeth Hernandez, sentenced to 30 days in federal prison for her role in Jan. 6, was recently handed a 10-year prison sentence for a fatal DUI in Missouri in 2022.",
      "There are no reports that Schwartz has re-offended in the weeks since his release.",
      "Shortly before Schwartz was pardoned, an appeals court reversed only one of the 11 charges against him, and none of the assault charges. Schwartz has been citing the appeals court decision as proof of his innocence while appearing on right-wing media shows.",
      "Schwartz is not the only Jan. 6 defendant with an extensive criminal history. A CBS News analysis of hundreds of sentencing documents found that at least 159 of pardoned Jan. 6 defendants had criminal records prior to that day. That includes at least 41 people who had been convicted of at least one violent crime prior to their actions on Jan. 6.",
      "\"There were a lot of folks who had no criminal history,\" said Jason Manning, a former federal prosecutor involved in more than 50 Jan. 6-related cases.",
      "\"There were a lot of other defendants, however, who had extensive histories of domestic abuse, histories of assaulting police officers for whom assaulting the police on January 6th was not the first time they had assaulted police.\"",
      "Allegations of domestic violence, threats",
      "Holeton says she met Schwartz on Facebook in 2019 and moved in with him in Owensboro, Kentucky, after several months of dating long distance. She says it was perfect for two weeks, and then things changed.",
      "\"I made a comment about how tall the corn had gotten in a week. We lived right across from a cornfield, and that comment started the argument that got me beat up,\" Holeton said.",
      "Holeton alleges Schwartz beat her. She says the violence persisted until she called the police in July 2019 when she alleged Schwartz was threatening to kill her and her son. Photos taken by the Kentucky State Police, and reviewed by CBS News, show numerous firearms belonging to Schwartz found on the property. Schwartz was eventually charged and convicted for \"terroristic threatening\" and possessing a handgun.",
      "Even when Schwartz was in prison, Holeton said she was afraid.",
      "\"I walked around the house with a big butcher knife, because I was afraid that they were just gonna let him out and he was just gonna show up,\" she said.",
      "According to a 2015 incident report, Schwartz also threatened police, reportedly telling an officer in Owensboro, \"I am going to shoot you right in the head.\"",
      "In another police report from 2020, Schwartz's then girlfriend, Shelly Stallings, alleged Schwartz bit her forehead and then continued to punch her in the head. In police bodycam footage, reviewed by CBS News, Stallings can be heard saying, \"I locked him out because I couldn't control him, I don't want to be beat up. \u2026 He just gets violent.\" Schwartz was later convicted of domestic violence.",
      "Holeton was not surprised when she heard Schwartz had been at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "\"He found an opportunity to go and be violent,\" she said. \"That man thrives on violence. He thrives on people fearing him.\"",
      "Two years later, when Holeton heard that Schwartz would be in prison for more than a decade, she said she felt a huge weight had been lifted. She took to TikTok and Facebook to share an old photo of her battered face and a screenshot of Schwartz's sentencing, with the caption, \"whether you agree with the J6 prisoners or not, myself and all the other women he beat on finally got some justice.\"",
      "\"I was like, oh, well, at least I don't have to worry about him just showing up at my house for the next 14 years,\" said Holeton, who did not want to share her specific location out of concern for her safety.",
      "\"He is not a hero\"",
      "Holeton, a registered Democrat, said she has voted for President Trump in the past three elections. She said she decided to vote for him in 2024 because she thought he would improve the economy, and she believed his administration would only pardon Jan. 6 defendants on a case-by-case basis.",
      "In an interview on Fox News in early January, Vice President-elect JD Vance said those who protested peacefully should be pardoned, but he made an exception for rioters who engaged in violence.",
      "\"If you committed violence that day, obviously you shouldn't be pardoned,\" he said. But Vance later told CBS News he supported the president's action, saying it \"rectified a wrong.\"",
      "Holeton believes, \"Most of those people should have been allowed to go home, but not people like Pete.\"",
      "\"The idea of pardoning people who had criminal histories, violent histories, it's a really poor choice if you're thinking about public safety going forward,\" said Manning.",
      "An online fundraiser for Schwartz has raised nearly $90,000 from supporters in the past two years.",
      "\"Pete is not the person that everybody thinks he is,\" said Holeton. \"Everyone is hailing him as a hero and he is not a hero. He is a violent, violent man.\"",

    "story": [
      "Billionaire Elon Musk's role in the Trump administration is to find ways to cut costs through the newly created\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. But a new court\u00a0filing\u00a0from the White House states that the Tesla CEO isn't an employee of DOGE, adding that Musk \"has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself.\"",
      "The filing raises questions about Musk's role in the Trump administration and at DOGE, a cost-cutting task force created by Mr. Trump on Jan. 20 that is working at a number of agencies, including the\u00a0Treasury Department\u00a0and the\u00a0IRS, in an effort to find fraud and waste. The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about Musk's role at DOGE.",
      "Musk, along with fellow billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy, was\u00a0originally tasked\u00a0by Mr. Trump with providing \"advice and guidance from outside of Government\" and partnering with the White House and Office of Management & Budget to drive large scale structural reform.\" Ramaswamy\u00a0left DOGE\u00a0in January and is planning a run for Ohio governor.",
      "Since Mr. Trump took office, DOGE has driven massive federal employee cuts and paused tranches of congressionally approved spending. Many of those federal workers, their unions and Democratic officials have argued that this is a result of Musk's unchecked authority. Mr. Trump has suggested that Musk largely answers to him.",
      "Last week, Musk \u2014 the world's richest person, with a net worth of\u00a0$398 billion\u00a0\u2014 stood behind President Trump at the Oval Office, describing DOGE's work as taking \"very simple and basic\" steps to cut federal spending. During a lengthy Q&A that followed, Mr. Trump was asked if there was anything Musk was told that he can't touch.",
      "\"Well, we haven't discussed that much,\" Mr. Trump replied. \"I'll tell him to go here, go there, he does it. He's got a very capable group of people.\"",
      "Asked by reporters if he was working closely with agency heads, Musk replied that he was working \"in partnership\" with them. \"I check with the president to make sure that this is what the president wants to happen,\" Musk added. \"We talk almost every day, and I double check things to make sure. 'Is this something, Mr. President, you want us to do this?' Then we'll do it.\"",
      "Multiple lawsuits, alarm bells",
      "At the same time, DOGE's efforts have sparked multiple lawsuits and\u00a0raised alarms\u00a0from Democratic lawmakers and consumer advocates over its reported access to personal data of millions of Americans and businesses.",
      "The White House's Feb. 17 filing came at the request of U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is hearing a case about the\u00a0constitutionality\u00a0of Musk's actions since the start of Mr. Trump's presidency. Fourteen states ranging from Arizona to Washington are suing Musk, DOGE and Mr. Trump, alleging that Musk is exceeding his authority and taking \"actions that can only be taken by a nominated and principal officer of the United States.\"",
      "The lawsuit claims that Musk \"does not occupy an office created by law and has no authority to exercise the powers of a principal officer, or any other officer.\"",
      "\"There is no greater threat to democracy than the accumulation of state power in the hands of a single, unelected individual,\" the lawsuit alleges. \"In recent weeks, defendant Elon Musk, with President Donald J. Trump's approval, has roamed through the federal government unraveling agencies, accessing sensitive data and causing mass chaos and confusion for state and local governments, federal employees and the American people,\" the lawsuit further claims.",
      "At a Feb. 17 hearing, Justice Department attorney Harry Graver told Chutkan, \"There is not a single instance of Musk or USDS commanding these actions,\" referring to\u00a0widespread firings of government employees\u00a0across various agencies last week. Instead, the government workers were fired by officials within their own agencies, he said.",
      "When asked at a press briefing at Mar-a-lago on Tuesday about the administration's contention that Musk isn't in charge of DOGE, Mr. Trump said, \"Elon is to me a patriot. So, you could call him an employee, you could call him a consultant, you could call him whatever you want.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Judge Chutkan ruled against the states' request for a temporary restraining order to stop Musk and DOGE from accessing data systems at seven federal agencies and firing or putting their employees on leave. She found that the states failed to show that they would suffer imminent, irreparable harm without relief, writing in her ruling that \"the 'possibility' that defendants may take actions that irreparably harm plaintiffs 'is not enough.'\"",
      "Nonetheless, in a hearing Monday, Chutkan warned that the alleged actions by Musk and DOGE are \"concerning\" and \"troubling.\" She said the mass firings of thousands of federal workers is \"not a small or common thing\" and noted that Musk has not been nominated to a position by the president or confirmed by the Senate.",
      "\"No actual or formal authority\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Tuesday signed an executive order that directs his administration to find ways to reduce the high costs of in vitro fertilization, or IVF, for Americans struggling with fertility.",
      "At an event at Mar-a-Lago, White House staff secretary Will Scharf told reporters that the order directs the Domestic Policy Council \"to make IVF and other fertility treatments more affordable for more Americans.\" The order requests that the council make policy recommendations within 90 days to protect access to IVF and \"aggressively\" reduce costs for the treatment.",
      "\"These are treatments that have become unaffordable for many Americans or been unaffordable for many Americans,\" Scharf said.",
      "Health insurance companies are not currently required to cover IVF treatments, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars.",
      "The executive order said it's the Trump administration's policy to \"ensure reliable access to IVF treatment, including by easing unnecessary statutory or regulatory burdens to make IVF treatment drastically more affordable.\"",
      "Mr. Trump vowed during the 2024 campaign that the treatments would either be covered by the government or insurance companies if he was reelected.",
      "\"Your government will pay for or your insurance company will be mandated to pay for all costs associated with IVF treatment,\" Mr. Trump said in August 2024.",
      "Weeks after Mr. Trump made the pledge, Senate Republicans blocked legislation that would have protected access to IVF and made the fertility treatments more affordable. Republicans said the legislation was too broad and only two GOP senators \u2014 Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2014 supported it.",
      "\"Republicans support IVF, full stop,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota, who was then the minority whip, said at the time, calling the vote \"an attempt by Democrats to try and create a political issue where there isn't one.\"",
      "The issue of access to fertility treatments became a political flashpoint last February after the\u00a0Alabama Supreme Court\u00a0ruled that frozen embryos were considered children under state law. The ruling caused an uproar and cleared the way for potential wrongful death claims if an embryo did not survive the process, causing several providers to pause IVF treatments. After the ruling, Mr. Trump called on the Alabama legislature to \"quickly find an immediate solution to preserve the availability of IVF\" in the state.",

The NSF had 1,450 employees prior to Tuesday's job cuts, the spokesperson said. The 168 workers who were fired represent about 12% of that number.",

These workers, who haven't yet gained civil service protection, are currently the focus of widespread cuts across multiple agencies as part of President Trump's efforts to shrink the size of the federal government.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday declined to stop Elon Musk and the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, from accessing data systems at seven federal agencies and firing or putting their employees on leave.",
      "U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan rejected a request for a temporary restraining order sought by 14 Democrat-led states as they pursue a challenge to Musk's actions. The states have argued that Musk, who the White House said is categorized as a special government employee, has unchecked authority and is violating the Constitution's Appointments Clause.",
      "But in a 10-page decision, Chutkan found that the states have failed to show that they will suffer imminent, irreparable harm without relief.",
      "\"The court is aware that DOGE's unpredictable actions have resulted in considerable uncertainty and confusion for plaintiffs and many of their agencies and residents,\" she wrote. \"But the 'possibility' that defendants may take actions that irreparably harm plaintiffs 'is not enough.'\"",
      "Chutkan, though, added that the states' claim that Musk's actions violate Appointments Clause has \"serious implications.\" Citing Supreme Court precedent, she wrote that they are the \"executive abuses\" that the constitutional provision seeks to prevent.",
      "\"Musk has not been nominated by the president nor confirmed by the U.S. Senate, as constitutionally required for officers who exercise 'significant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States,'\" she said. \"Bypassing this 'significant structural safeguard of the constitutional scheme,' Musk has rapidly taken steps to fundamentally reshape the Executive Branch.\"",
      "President Trump issued an executive order establishing the Musk-led DOGE on his first day in office and tasked the agency with reducing the size of the government and cutting federal spending. Since then, DOGE's employees have been dispatched to more than a dozen agencies to implement Mr. Trump's agenda. In a court filing on Monday, the White House sought to clarify that Musk is not the formal head of DOGE, but oversees the effort as a senior White House adviser.",
      "DOGE's actions raised alarms for Democrats and labor unions representing federal workers after it was revealed that Musk and his team had gained access to government systems. Musk has publicly called for entire agencies to be \"deleted,\" and DOGE has claimed on social media that it is responsible for contracts being canceled.",
      "In an effort to combat DOGE's efforts, several states and the unions have filed federal lawsuits seeking to stop the task force from having access to information and payment systems.",
      "The case before Chutkan was filed last week and claims that Musk's actions are a violation of the Appointments Clause and exceed the scope of his authority.",
      "Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and owner of X, is an \"unelected, unconfirmed government official\" who is \"exercising unprecedented executive authority,\" the states said in a court filing.",
      "\"An individual accountable only to the president \u2014 if he answers to anyone at all \u2014 is exercising apparently limitless power within the Executive Branch,\" the states wrote in their complaint. \"Mr. Musk's conduct has wreaked havoc on the federal government and caused mass chaos and confusion for state and local governments, federal employees, the American public, and people around the world who depend on the United States for leadership and support.\"",
      "The states asked Chutkan to issue a temporary restraining order that would temporarily bar Musk and DOGE from accessing data systems at the Office of Personnel Management and the Departments of Education, Labor, Health and Human Services, Energy, Transportation and Commerce. They also asked her to prevent him from terminating, furloughing or placing on involuntary leave any federal employees at those agencies.",
      "The Justice Department, though, argued that the states cannot identify any imminent, irreparable harm \u2014 one of the four factors they have to prove to receive relief \u2014 that warranted the court's intervention. The Trump administration also said the relief sought by the states was too broad and would sweep in anyone affiliated with DOGE, including Mr. Trump and Senate-confirmed administration officials.",
      "Justice Department lawyers wrote in a court filing that the states' claim that Musk has the authority to make decisions for the government is \"wrong,\" and \"rests entirely on conflating influence and authority.\"",
      "\"An advisor does not become an officer simply because the officer listens to his advice. And stripped of their lengthy rhetoric, the states do not actually cite a single example of where Elon Musk (or anyone at USDS) has been given formal authority to exercise the sovereign power of the United States,\" they wrote, referring to the U.S. DOGE Service, the entity's formal name.",
      "A declaration filed by Joshua Fisher, director of the White House's Office of Administration, noted that Musk serves as a senior advisor to the president, as well as a special government employee. He has \"no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself,\" Fisher stated in the filing. Musk is also not the administrator of DOGE, according to the declaration.",
      "Chutkan held a hearing to consider the states' request on Monday, and she appeared skeptical that the states had shown that they would be imminently harmed by Musk and DOGE's actions.",
      "A \"generalized fear that this is going to happen, even if it looks like it's likely to happen,\" is not enough to satisfy the need for a temporary restraining order, she said.",
      "\"I'm not seeing it so far,\" Chutkan told a lawyer for the states, adding that they were effectively seeking a \"prophylactic\" temporary restraining order, which she said is \"not allowed.\"",
      "But Anjana Samant, a lawyer for the state of New Mexico, which is leading the suit, called DOGE and its actions a \"one-of-a-kind situation.\"",
      "The nation has never experienced \"this type of wielding of power in this way,\" she said",
      "Chutkan warned that the alleged actions by Musk and DOGE are \"concerning\" and \"troubling.\" She said the mass firings of thousands of federal workers is \"not a small or common thing\" and noted that Musk has not been nominated to a position by the president nor confirmed by the Senate.",
      "Musk, Chutkan said, is a private citizen tasked with directing an organization, DOGE, to have access to \"the entire workings of the federal government.\" She noted that, according to the states, the task force has fired workers, cut contracts and terminated programs, \"all without apparently any congressional oversight.\"",
      "\"The allegation isn't that agencies can't manage their own workforce,\" she said. \"The allegation is that DOGE is coming into these agencies and accessing data and firing people, terminating contracts. They're essentially running the government. That's the problem.\"",
      "But Harry Graver, a Justice Department lawyer, said \"there is not a single instance of Musk or USDS commanding these actions,\" and they are instead being taken by high-ranking agency officials.",
      "In a filing Monday submitted after the hearing, Justice Department lawyers reiterated that the Trump administration is \"not aware of any source of legal authority granting USDS or the U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization the power to order personnel actions at any of the agencies listed above.\"",
      "Chutkan oversaw the federal prosecution of Mr. Trump that was brought by former special counsel Jack Smith in Washington, D.C. The president faced four counts stemming from what prosecutors alleged was an unlawful plot to subvert the transfer of presidential power after the 2020 election.",
      "Chutkan granted a request from Smith to dismiss the case after Mr. Trump won the presidential election in November because of a Justice Department policy that forbids the prosecution of a sitting president.",

      "Washington \u2014 Senate Majority Leader John Thune announced Tuesday that the Senate will move forward with a vote on a budget proposal to begin enacting President Trump's agenda this week, moving ahead of Republicans in the House who are pursuing a competing plan.",
      "\"It's time to act on the decisive mandate the American people gave to President Trump in November,\" Thune said in a post on X Tuesday afternoon, adding that \"[s]ecuring the border, rebuilding our defense, and unleashing American energy\" will begin \"this week.\"",

      "The House is also moving forward with its own budget resolution, which would address the border security, defense, energy and tax priorities in a single bill. That could see a vote on the House floor as soon as next week.",
      "The Senate Budget Committee marked up its resolution last week, voting to advance it to the floor on Wednesday. During the committee meeting, the panel's chairman Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina touted the legislation, outlining that it would allow $175 billion to be spent on border security and $150 billion on military capabilities, while instructing committees to find reconciliation-compliant offsets to cut mandatory spending outside of Social Security.",
      "Graham acknowledged that while \"there's been a bit of debate between the House and the Senate about what to do and why,\" he decided to move forward with the budget resolution due to a \"sense of urgency\" about implementing Mr. Trump's immigration agenda.",
      "\"The problem we have now is that ICE is running out of money,\" Graham said. \"And to my colleagues in the House, I hope you can pass one big beautiful bill meeting the priorities of President Trump and what we've been promising to do as a party. But we've got to move on this issue.\"",
      "The House also advanced its own budget proposal out of committee last week, which includes up to $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, spending cuts of at least $1.5 trillion and an increase of the debt ceiling by $4 trillion. The House is away this week on recess and plans to bring its own resolution when lawmakers return next week.",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise urged in a post on X shortly after Thune's announcement Tuesday that it's \"time to act on ALL of the powerful mandates\" that voters delivered to Mr. Trump in November's election. The Louisiana Republican touted the many components that would be included \"in one big, beautiful bill\" that will start moving when the House approves its own budget.",
      "Thune's announcement on Tuesday that the Senate will vote on the proposal as soon as this week marks a step forward. But approving the budget resolution is just one hurdle in the reconciliation process.",
      "Reconciliation allows lawmakers to bypass the 60-vote threshold in the Senate that makes advancing partisan legislation extremely difficult. But in order to use it, lawmakers must first approve identical budget resolutions through both chambers and direct committees to craft bills reconciling spending with the new budget goals. The legislation can ultimately include only provisions dealing with taxes, spending or the debt limit, and any new spending must be paid for. The Senate parliamentarian must also sign off on the package, and settles disputes over whether a provision has direct budgetary consequences.",
      "Despite support among Senate Republicans for a two-bill approach, House Republicans have argued that passing two pieces of legislation carries a wider margin for error, given the narrow GOP majority in the lower chamber.",
      "Senate Democrats have expressed opposition to the budget resolution. During the committee markup, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington called the resolution \"pro-billionaire, anti-middle class,\" while Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon warned of potential cuts to Medicaid, saying he expects an \"effort to keep the Medicaid cuts hidden behind the curtain, but they're going to come sooner or later.\"",

What caused it remains under investigation by the Canadian Transportation Safety Board, which said Tuesday that the aircraft's black boxes have been recovered, and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration. Here's what we know so far.",
      "The ceiling of the plane \"had become the floor\"",
      "Delta Air Lines Flight 4819 departed Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport in Minnesota on Monday morning, carrying 76 passengers and four crew members.",
      "The plane, operated by Minneapolis-based Delta Air Lines subsidiary Endeavor Air, struck the landing strip as it arrived at Toronto Airport at about 1:15 p.m. CST, according to Delta. Images and video of the accident showed the CRJ-900 aircraft catch fire when it hit the pavement and proceeded to turn sideways while sliding across the airfield, losing its tail and both wings along the way.",
      "It eventually flipped over and came to a halt. Passengers on the plane have since described hanging upside down, suspended by their fastened seatbelts, with one person recalling how he \"crashed down onto the ceiling, which had become the floor\" after unbuckling.",
      "Emergency teams rushed to the site of the crash, extinguishing the blaze and then evacuating the passengers who were still inside. At a news conference Tuesday, Toronto International Airport president and CEO Deborah Flint praised the Delta flight crew and emergency workers at the airport for launching a \"textbook\" response to the accident that got underway \"within minutes.\"",
      "\"The crew of Delta Flight 4819 heroically led passengers to safety, evacuating a jet that had overturned on the runway on landing that was amidst, smoke and fire,\" Flint said. \"Thank you for all that you do every day and every night in service of safe air travel.\"",
      "Two people were critically injured",
      "All 80 passengers and crew members on the Delta flight survived the crash. Emergency responders and the flight crew themselves ushered passengers down the aisle of the overturned jet and helped evacuate them through an emergency exit door. More footage from the crash showed passengers climbing out of the aircraft and stepping out onto a snowy tarmac, where powerful winds whipped past.",
      "Officials originally reported that 19 people suffered injuries in the accident, but the number was revised up to 21 between Monday and Tuesday. Flint said 19 people were taken to hospitals in the area for medical treatment immediately after the crash, and two more were admitted later on. Corey Tkatch, commander of operations for Peel Regional Paramedic Services, said some people suffered back sprains, head injuries, anxiety and \"nausea and vomiting due to the fuel exposure.\"",
      "Nineteen of the injured people had been released by Tuesday, according to Delta Air Lines, while two remained hospitalized and their conditions were listed as critical. The exact nature of their situations has not been publicized, but Flint told reporters the people hurt on Flight 4819 had a range of injuries considered minor to critical, none of which are life-threatening.",
      "Peel Regional Paramedic Services at first classified a child as injured and in critical condition, but the Hospital for Sick Children later said the child was in good condition.

    "summary": "Senior officials from the U.S. and Russia meet in Saudi Arabia on improving ties and ending the war in Ukraine - but Ukraine isn't invited.",
    "story": [
      "Riyadh, Saudi Arabia \u2014 Senior officials from Russia and the U.S. met in Saudi Arabia Tuesday to begin talks on improving ties and negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine. As CBS News correspondent Holly Williams reports, some felt the Trump administration had granted Vladimir Putin some degree of victory just by agreeing to hold the high-level meeting with his regime as the war he ignited with his full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, grinds on.",
      "That sentiment may be felt most acutely by the leaders of Ukraine, who were not invited to participate in the initial discussion about the fate of their nation.",
      "Delegations led by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met behind closed doors at the Diriyah Palace in Riyadh. The meeting marked another significant step in President Trump's move to reverse three years of U.S. policy focused on isolating Russia over its war on Ukraine, and it is meant to pave the way for a likely meeting between Mr. Trump and Putin.",
      "Speaking to reporters after the meeting, U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said the U.S. and Russian delegations had agreed to establish a \"consultation mechanism to address irritants to our bilateral relationship,\" and Rubio told reporters that would include a re-staffing of the two nations' respective embassies.",
      "Bruce said Rubio and Lavrov had agreed to appoint \"high-level teams to begin working on a path to ending the conflict in Ukraine as soon as possible in a way that is enduring, sustainable, and acceptable to all sides.\" Rubio said the respective embassies in Washington and Moscow would need to be re-staffed, as \"we're going to need to have vibrant diplomatic missions that are able to function normally in order to be able to continue these conduits.\"",
      "Neither Bruce's statement nor a full read-out on the meeting provided by the State Department said anything about involving Ukraine or its European neighbors in the negotiations. The State Department said only that Mr. Trump was, \"the only leader in the world who can get Ukraine and Russia to agree to\" a ceasefire.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday that his country wouldn't accept the outcome of any negotiations conducted without Kyiv's involvement.",
      "Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Waltz suggested Ukraine's government would have a say, calling it \"common sense\" that \"if you're going to bring both sides together, you have to talk to both sides.\"",
      "\"We are absolutely talking to both sides,\" Waltz said, noting Mr. Trump's recent phone call with Zelenskyy, right after he spoke with Putin last week. He also noted Rubio's recent meetings with European officials and the fact that British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is due in Washington next week, saying, \"the facts will continue to push back on this notion that our allies haven't been consulted... they are being consulted, literally, almost on a daily basis, and we'll continue to do so.\"",
      "Rubio told the reporters the European Union was \"going to have to be at the table at some point, because they have sanctions [against Russia] as well.\"",
      "Mr. Trump earlier this month upended U.S. policy toward Ukraine and Russia by saying he and Putin had agreed in a phone call to begin negotiations on ending the war, leaving many Ukrainians feeling betrayed as they seemingly had no say in the matter.",
      "Rubio was accompanied Tuesday by U.S. national security adviser Mike Waltz and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, while Lavrov sat next to the Kremlin's foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov.",
      "The talks marked a significant expansion of U.S.-Russian contacts nearly three years into a war that has seen relations fall to the lowest level in decades.",
      "\"The economic aspect of the discussions\"",
      "Bruce said Rubio and Lavrov had also agreed Tuesday to ongoing cooperation toward economic and investment opportunities \"which will emerge from a successful end to the conflict in Ukraine.\"",
      "In a possible indication of how significant a factor those \"opportunities\" could be in the negotiations, senior Russian businessman Kirill Dmitriev, a Western-educated banker who now heads a government-created investment fund, was also expected to take part in the talks on Tuesday, according to Russian media.",
      "\"I will be responsible for the economic aspect of the discussions,\" Dmitriev was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency ahead of the talks in Riyadh. \"The figure that we are voicing for the first time now is that American business has lost more than $300 billion by leaving the Russian market,\" he said, apparently referring to the impact of sanctions imposed on Russia under former President Biden.",
      "\"Finding joint economic paths, positive solutions to issues, is extremely important, mainly for the U.S. and for many other countries that are beginning to understand that the Russian market is extremely attractive and that it is necessary to be present in it,\" he said, adding that he hoped for \"a positive dialogue.\"",
      "\"We see that President Trump is very actively solving a large number of problems in the world and we hope that the Russian Federation's position will be heard very clearly and the dialogue will continue,\" Dmitriev said, according to Interfax.",
      "Dmitriev, who studied at Stanford and Harvard before working early in his career at Goldman Sachs, previously served as an interlocutor between Moscow and Washington during Mr. Trump's first term in office.",
      "Ukrainians, Europeans sidelined from talks",
      "The recent U.S. diplomatic blitz on the war has sent Kyiv and key allies scrambling to ensure a seat at the table amid concerns that Washington and Moscow could press ahead with a deal that won't be favorable to them.",
      "France called an emergency meeting of European Union countries and the U.K. on Monday to decide how to respond. French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday said he spoke by phone to Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy following the meeting.",
      "\"We seek a strong and lasting peace in Ukraine,\" Macron wrote on X. \"To achieve this, Russia must end its aggression, and this must be accompanied by strong and credible security guarantees for the Ukrainians,\" he said as he vowed to \"work on this together with all Europeans, Americans, and Ukrainians.\"",
      "Before that meeting, Starmer said for the first time Monday that the U.K. could deploy troops to Ukraine to help secure an eventual peace. Sweden also indicated a willingness Monday to deploy forces to Ukraine to keep an eventual peace.",
      "While other European powers declined to make explicit commitments, calling discussions about deploying peacekeepers to Ukraine premature, Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk ruled out sending Polish troops to the neighboring nation.",
      "Ahead of the meeting in France, Tusk did stress that European powers should immediately spend more on defense.",
      "\"If we, Europeans, fail to spend big on defense now, we will be forced to spend 10 times more if we don't prevent a wider war,\" Tusk said on social media.",
      "A boost for \"the status of Saudi Arabia\"?",
      "Ahead of the Riyadh talks, Kirill Dmitriev, the head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund who the Kremlin said might join the meeting, underscored their importance in comments to The Associated Press.",
      "\"Good U.S.-Russia relations are very important for the whole world. Only jointly can Russia and the U.S. address lots of world problems, resolve for global conflicts and offer solutions,\" Dmitriev, who said he and his team would focus on economic issues at the talks, told the AP.",
      "The Saudi-owned satellite channel Al Arabiya, citing the Russian delegation, described Moscow's priority as \"real normalization with Washington.\"",
      "Diriyah Palace sits across the street from Riyadh's Diplomatic Quarter. It's also just next to the Ritz Carlton hotel, which became famous in 2017 after de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman detained other princes and the country's elite there as part of what the royal court called a crackdown on corruption that also sidelined any potential challenge to his taking control of the kingdom.",
      "Hosting the talks is a major step toward a goal Prince Mohammed has pursued throughout the war \u2014 putting the kingdom in the middle of diplomatic negotiations. The Saudis helped in prisoner negotiations and hosted Zelenskyy for an Arab League summit in the kingdom in 2023. Zelenskyy likely will travel to Saudi Arabia later this week.",
      "For Prince Mohammed, once described as a \"pariah\" by former President Joe Biden over the 2018 killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, hosting such talks burnish the otherwise-tarnished image the West has of him.",
      "Ahead of the summit, the Saudi daily newspaper Okaz described the moment as the \"world's eye on Riyadh.\"",
      "Writing in the London-based but Saudi-owned newspaper Asharq Al Awsat, journalist Mishari al-Dhaidi described the summit as \"a major step on the international political chess arena, revealing the status of Saudi Arabia and its positive influence for the benefit of all the people.\"",
      "The prince also has maintained close relations to Russia throughout its war on Ukraine, both through the OPEC+ oil cartel and diplomatically.",
      "Hosting the summit also balances the harsh criticism recently levied by the kingdom's tightly controlled media at Mr. Trump over his repeated comments that he wants the U.S. to \"own\" the Gaza Strip, which has been devastated by the Israeli military offensive there since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack. The Palestinians want Gaza and the West Bank for a future state, something backed by the wider Arab world and nearly all of the international community.",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Feb 2025 20:03:34 -0500",
    "summary": "Vatican authorities said Monday that Pope Francis has a complex infection in his respiratory system and will require more targeted drug treatment. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Pope Francis has a complex infection in his respiratory system and will require more targeted drug treatment, according to Vatican authorities Monday. On Tuesday, he underwent a chest CT scan, which showed the onset of bilateral pneumonia, requiring further drug therapy, the Vatican press office said.",
      "The 88-year-old pope has been\u00a0hospitalized since Friday at Rome's Gemelli hospital after coming down with bronchitis the week before, and officials said he is suffering from a \"polymicrobial respiratory tract infection.\"",
      "Here's a look at the Pope's diagnosis and what his treatment could involve.",
      "What is bilateral pneumonia?",
      "Bilateral or double pneumonia is when you have pneumonia in both lungs.\u00a0Pneumonia\u00a0is an infection that inflames the air sacs of the lungs, which can lead to them filling with liquid. Symptoms include cough, fever, chills and trouble breathing.",
      "Pneumonia can range from mild to life-threatening. It's most serious for infants and people older than 65 as well as people with heart problems or weakened immune systems.",
      "This development was a likely worry given the pope's medical condition.",
      "\"Even though we can treat pneumonias with antibiotics, pneumonias are also one of the leading causes of death,\" said Sauler of Yale University. He said antibiotics don't work in isolation and that a person's immune system is also critical to fighting off pneumonia, pointing out that the immune systems in older people aren't usually as resilient.",
      "\"When you're 88 years old, the age of the pope, then all of a sudden you have risk factors that make the situation tougher than just a routine pneumonia.\"",
      "What is a polymicrobial respiratory tract infection?",
      "Essentially, it means there's a mix of bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites growing in someone's lungs.",
      "\"Often times, people will get a bronchitis or an airway infection and that can often start a cascade of multiple problems, including infections in the lungs,\" said Dr. Maor Sauler, who specializes in adult pulmonary and critical care medicine at Yale University's School of Medicine. He said such issues were common in older people whose immune systems might be weaker or had complex health issues.",
      "\"It likely means he has more than one organism in his lungs,\" Sauler said, explaining that the pope's doctors might have to adjust his treatment to make sure the antibiotics attack all the various organisms.",
      "Pneumonia is a diagnosis of inflammation or fluid in the lungs, which can caused by a viral, bacterial or fungal infection. \"Bilateral\" pneumonia means the infection has developed in both lungs.",
      "How serious is polymicrobial respiratory tract infection?",
      "For someone with the pope's medical history \u2014 he lost part of his right lung decades ago and has previously had pneumonia \u2014 it's worrying that he's been hospitalized.",
      "Dr. Nick Hopkinson, medical director of Asthma + Lung UK, said most healthy people would likely recover quickly from bronchitis.",
      "But in people whose lungs are already damaged, \"bacteria can come and colonize the airways \u2026 and you start to see infections which makes it more difficult to treat.\" In people with lungs that have been previously compromised, they might need help breathing, including oxygen support or chest physiotherapy to help them clear fluids building up in their lungs.",
      "Still, Hopkinson said that getting the pope on the right medications should help.",
      "\"If they've identified particular things to treat, they can treat those and he'll start to recover.\"",
      "How long might this take?",
      "That depends. Antibiotic treatments typically take from a few days up to about two weeks. Hopkinson said the pope might be given various medicines, including ones that people typically take for asthma or conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, in addition to getting physiotherapy to help keep his chest as clear as possible.",
      "\"Some infections require prolonged treatment because they're just harder to clear from the system,\" Hopkinson said. \"It sounds like they've identified the bugs that are responsible and they'll be able to treat those\u2026but we'll just have to wait and see.\"",
      "Dr. Peter Openshaw, a lung expert at Imperial College London, said the presence of multiple organisms wasn't unusual in people with complex medical histories but could be hard to manage.",
      "What will doctors be monitoring next?",
      "Sauler said the biggest thing to watch out for in the coming days is any sign that the pope is getting worse.",
      "\"I'd be most interested in making sure he's not worsening despite the best efforts (of his doctors). That's usually a bad prognostic sign,\" he said, adding that they would likely review his condition in a few days to see whether or not the prescribed drugs are working.",
      "\"I have optimism and hope that he can pull through with the right antibiotic.\"",
      "What are the pope's other health issues?",
      "Pope Francis has been treated for a number of health issues in recent years, including two abdominal surgeries\u00a0and several previous\u00a0respiratory infections, including one that hospitalized him days before Holy Week in 2023. Knee trouble\u00a0led him to cut back on travel, and he often uses a wheelchair.",
      "He said in 2022, \"I think at my age and with these limitations, I have to save (my energy) to be able to serve the church, or on the contrary, think about the possibility of stepping aside.\"",
      "But in a rare\u00a0interview\u00a0with CBS News' Norah O'Donnell in 2024, the pope described his health as \"fine\" and said he had no plans to leave the papacy.",

Two of the injured passengers, a 40-year-old woman and 60-year-old man, were initially said to be critically hurt and were airlifted to a hospital, while the others' injuries were considered mild to moderate, according to a regional paramedics service that responded to the scene. Delta said two people remained hospitalized Tuesday, CBS News Minnesota reported.",
      "One of the passengers speaking out about his experience is Pete Carlson, who boarded the plane Monday morning at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport to attend a paramedics conference in Canada.",
      "In an interview with Canadian broadcaster CBC News, Carlson recalled the sounds of \"cement and metal\" and the scent of gasoline as the plane skidded down the icy runway in Toronto, losing both wings and its tail and turning over completely so its wheels faced the sky.",
      "\"As we made our descent and made touchdown, it was just a very forceful event, where all of a sudden everything just kind of went sideways,\" Carlson told CBC News. \"And then, next thing I know, it was kind of a blink and I'm upside down, still strapped in.\"",
      "Carlson had fastened his seatbelt, as instructed, prior to landing. When he unlatched the belt to evacuate the plane, he said he \"crashed down onto the ceiling, which had become the floor.\"",
      "Emergency workers at the airport were able to reach the site of the crash \"within minutes,\" said Deborah Flint, president and CEO of Toronto Pearson International Airport, at a news conference Monday night. They quickly helped evacuate everyone on board. Flint said 22 of the passengers were Canadian and the rest were multinational, but did not provide details on how many were American or other nationalities.",
      "\"The most powerful part of today was, there was just people. No countries, no nothing,\" Carlson said. \"There was just people together helping each other.\"",
      "Another passenger, John Nelson, captured video of the plane, charred and overturned, as people climbed out of it into the freezing cold.",
      "Nelson described the plane making a hard landing before screeching over the pavement on its side and ultimately flipping onto its back,\u00a0CBS News Minnesota\u00a0reported.",
      "\"There was, like, a big fireball outside the left side of the plane and when we got finished we were upside down, everybody else was there as well,\" Nelson said. \"We tried to get out of there as quickly as possible.\"",
      "Several additional videos emerged online as passengers began to film the evacuation. In one video shared on Snapchat, passenger Ashley Zook appeared to dangle upside down from her seat inside the plane with her seatbelt fastened, AFP reported. The crash seemed to have knocked out the lights inside the plane, and it was dark.",
      "That same social media video showed harsh winds whipping past Zook after she exited the plane.",
      "\"I was just in a plane crash, oh my god,\" she said in the video.",
      "Another passenger, skier and sports influencer Pete Koukov, shared another video of the crash-landing on Instagram. A flight attendant wearing an Endeavor Air uniform is seen helping people evacuate the plane one by one through an emergency exit door, which Koukov climbed through himself. Endeavor Air is a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines headquartered in Minneapolis.",
      "The flight attendant can be heard directing passengers to \"drop everything\" and urging them to \"come on.\"",
      "\"Holy f***!\" Koukov repeatedly exclaims in the recording after getting of the plane. His Instagram post includes the message: \"Being alive feels pretty cool today.\"",
      "Koukov later told CNN that \"we were upside down hanging like bats\" inside the plane before evacuating. He said he \"didn't know anything was the matter\" until the plane hit the ground.",

    "summary": "Hamas says it will not only release more Israeli hostages than expected this week, but the terrorist group will also hand over the bodies of 4 slain captives.",
    "story": [
      "Cairo\u00a0\u2014 In a surprise announcement, a top Hamas leader said Tuesday that the U.S. and Israeli-designated terrorist group would release six living Israeli hostages on Saturday and the bodies of four others on Thursday, including the remains of the Bibas family, who for many Israelis have embodied the captives' plight in Gaza.",
      "Israel has said it is gravely concerned about Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir, but has not confirmed their deaths. Hamas said they were killed in an Israeli airstrike early in the war.",
      "Kfir, who was 9 months old at the time, was the youngest hostage taken in the Hamas-orchestrated Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack that triggered the war in Gaza. Israel's retaliatory war in Gaza has killed more than 48,000 people, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in the Palestinian territory.",
      "A video of the abduction on Oct. 7 showed Shiri swaddling her redheaded boys in a blanket and being whisked away by armed men.",
      "Hamas leader Khalil al-Hayya, in prerecorded remarks on Tuesday, said the \"Bibas family\" would be included in the handover of four bodies. They will be the first hostage remains released by the group under the current ceasefire, which took effect on January 19.",
      "The six to be released on Saturday are the last of the 33 living hostages to be freed during the ceasefire's first phase, according to the terms of the agreement brokered by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt. The group that represents the hostages' families in Israel welcomed the news Tuesday and named the six set to be released as Eliya Cohen, Tal Shoham, Omer Shem Tov, Omer Wenkert, Hisham Al-Sayed and Avera Mengistu.",
      "The terms of the deal called for only three more hostages to be freed in this next exchange, and it was not immediately clear why Hamas had changed the plan.",
      "An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, said however that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had agreed to allow long-requested mobile homes and construction equipment into Gaza as part of efforts to accelerate the hostages' release.",
      "Hamas last week threatened to delay its ongoing releases of hostages, citing the refusal to allow in mobile homes and heavy equipment among other alleged Israeli violations of the truce, but an agreement was reached ahead of the Saturday handover, which went ahead without incident.",
      "An American-Israeli dual national, Sagui Dekel-Chen, was among the three hostages released on Feb. 15 \u2014 the second U.S. national freed by Hamas during this ceasefire after Keith Siegel was handed over earlier in the month.",
      "The hostages have been freed in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli prisons \u2013 including some who were serving long sentences for serious crimes.",
      "The ceasefire has paused the deadliest fighting ever between Israel and Hamas, enabled a surge of aid into the devastated Gaza Strip and allowed hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to return to their homes, or what is left of them, as Israeli forces have withdrawn from much of the territory.",
      "The sides have yet to negotiate the second and more difficult phase, in which Hamas would release dozens more hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal.",
      "Major challenges are ahead. Israel's government says it wants to eliminate Hamas' military and governing capabilities in Gaza. But the terrorist group quickly reasserted its control over the territory during the ceasefire despite losing leaders and many fighters.",
      "In addition, President Trump's new proposal to relocate the Palestinians out of Gaza so the U.S. can redevelop the territory has been rejected by the Arab world and by the Palestinians, whom Mr. Trump \u00a0has said would not be allowed to return. But Israel has embraced the plan and, along with the Trump administration, has emphasized they share the same goals in the war.",
      "Israelis were horrified by the sight of three emaciated hostages in an earlier release this month, and revelations about hostages being held alone, barefoot or in chains have increased the pressure on Netanyahu's government to push ahead with the ceasefire's next stage.",

    "story": [
      "Egyptian officials announced Tuesday the discovery of the tomb of King Thutmose II, the last of the lost tombs of the kings of ancient Egypt's Eighteenth Dynasty, which reigned for over two centuries between about 1550 BC and 1292 BC. It's the first royal Egyptian tomb to be discovered since King Tutankhamun's final resting place was found in 1922.",
      "A joint Egyptian-British archaeological mission discovered Thutmose II's tomb in the mount of Thebes area, west of Luxor and the renowned Valley of the Kings. The team and the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, which made the announcement, said evidence was discovered that clearly indicates it was King Thutmose II's tomb during excavations of what had previously been known only as tomb No. C4.",
      "The entrance and main passage into the structure were discovered in 2022, and internal excavations have continued meticulously since then.",
      "Dr. Mohamed Ismail Khaled, Secretary-General of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, said when the mission first found the entrance to the tomb and its main passage almost three years ago, the team believed it could belong to one of the wives of the kings, given its proximity to the tomb of the wives of King Thutmose III and its proximity to the tomb of Queen Hatshepsut, which was prepared for her as a royal wife before she became ruler of the ancient kingdom. She ended up being buried in the Valley of the Kings, due to her ascent to the throne.",
      "As the excavation work and examination of artifacts continued, the mission found new evidence that identified the owner of the mysterious tomb as King Thutmose II, suggesting also that his burial rites were carried out by Queen Hatshepsut, who was his wife and half-sister.",
      "Khaled said parts of alabaster vessels found in the ruins have inscriptions bearing the name of King Thutmose II and identifying him as the \"deceased king,\" along with the name of his wife, Hatshepsut, all of which he said had helped to confirm Thutmose II as the owner of the tomb.",
      "He described the discovery as one of the most important archaeological finds in recent years. The artifacts discovered are important additions to the body of knowledge around the history of the area and the reign of King Thutmose II.",
      "The mummy of King Thutmose II was discovered during the 19th century, not far away at another archaeological site known as the Deir el-Bahari Cachette, to which the it was likely moved centuries after being looted by tomb raiders, according to the\u00a0relatively new National Museum\u00a0of Egyptian Civilization. His mummy is now on display, among those of other ancient royals, at the museum.",
      "The tomb is in a poor state of preservation due largely to exposure to floods shortly after Thutmose II's death, according to Mohamed Abdel Badie, Head of the Egyptian Antiquities Sector at the Supreme Council of Antiquities and Head of the Egyptian team that has worked on the dig. Abdel Badie said initial studies also indicate much of the original contents of the tomb were moved to another location after the ancient floods.",
      "He said the teams had discovered mortar in the tomb with remnants of blue inscriptions and yellow stars, and some paragraphs from the book of \"Imydwat,\" which is one of the most important funerary books found in ancient Egyptian tombs, written to help guide the late royals through their underworld journey.",
      "Dr. Piers Litherland, head of the English team at the site, said the tomb is characterized by a simple architectural design typical of those chosen by the successive rulers of Egypt who came after Thutmose II.",
      "Litherland said the mission would continue its survey work and try to determine where the rest of the contents from Thutmose II's tomb were relocated to, and to uncover any further secrets that may have been locked beneath the earth for millennia.",

      "A painting by street artist Banksy with an environmental message and an estimate of up to 5 million pounds ($6.3 million) is going up for auction, with some of the proceeds helping victims of the Los Angeles wildfires.",
      "Sotheby's auction house said Tuesday that \"Crude Oil (Vettriano)\" is being sold by Sotheby's in London on March 4 from the collection of Mark Hoppus, bassist with California skate-punk band Blink-182, who sees Banksy as a kindred spirit.",
      "Hoppus said he was drawn to the subversion, humor and intelligence of Banksy's work and the similarities between \"skateboarding, punk rock and art.\"",
      "\"I feel like street art and punk rock have the same core,\" Hoppus said. \"The left-out and overlooked making their own reality. \u2026 Just go make art. It's the same spirit. And I've loved art and especially street art ever since realizing that.\"",
      "\"Crude Oil (Vettriano)\" is part of a 2005 series of works in which Banksy put a satirical spin on famous paintings \u2014 withering Vincent van Gogh's \"Sunflowers\" and smashing the diner window in Edward Hopper's \"Nighthawks.\" The artist said his aim was to show that \"the real damage done to our environment is not done by graffiti writers and drunken teenagers, but by big business.\"",
      "The work going under the hammer is based on \"The Singing Butler,\" a painting by Scottish artist Jack Vettriano showing a couple in evening dress dancing on a beach as servants proffer sheltering umbrellas. Banksy has added a sinking oil liner and two figures lugging a barrel of toxic waste.",
      "\"We loved this painting since the moment we saw it,\" said Hoppus, who bought the artwork with his wife Skye in 2011. He said the painting \u2013 \"unmistakably Banksy, but different\" \u2013 has hung in the family's homes in London and LA ever since.",

      "An Associated Press journalist and other invited foreign media on the plane witnessed the tense 30-minute standoff as the Philippine plane pressed on with its low-altitude patrol around Scarborough with the Chinese navy helicopter hovering close above it or flying to its left in cloudy weather.",
      "\"You are flying too close, you are very dangerous and endangering the lives of our crew and passengers,\" the Philippine pilot told the Chinese navy helicopter by radio at one point. \"Keep away and distance your aircraft from us, you are violating the safety standard set by FAA and ICAO.\"",

      "Confrontations on the high seas have spiked between Chinese and Philippine coast guards in the last two years at Scarborough and Second Thomas Shoal, where a grounded Philippine navy ship has served as a military territorial outpost since 1999 but has since been closely surrounded by Chinese coast guard, navy and other ships.",
      "While most analysts believe the most likely origin of any potential military conflict between the United States and China would be an attempt by China to invade Taiwan, the escalating tension between Beijing and the Philippines is also a possible contact point, as the U.S. has a mutual defense treaty with the Philippines, which could mean American intervention.",

As CBS News Cecelia Vega reported for 60 Minutes last year, to assert its claim over the sea, China has used tactics just short of war, sometimes leading to violent confrontations, in what has been called \"the most dangerous conflict no one is talking about.\"",
      "In December, the Philippines announced plans to acquire the Typhon missile system from the U.S. as part of a push to secure its maritime interests, drawing warnings from China of a regional \"arms race.\"",
      "The U.S. has said it's obligated to defend the Philippines \u2014 its oldest treaty ally in Asia \u2014 if Filipino forces, ships or aircraft come under armed attack, including in the South China Sea.

    "story": [
      "Bangkok \u2014 New government regulations on social media in Vietnam give authorities increased powers to prevent dissent and control the news, along with the tools to more easily track down critics and silence them, according to an analysis released Tuesday.",
      "Vietnam's authorities implemented \"Decree 147\" in December, tightening regulations on social media companies like Facebook, X, YouTube and TikTok in a bid to further stifle criticism, said Ben Swanton, one of the authors of the report by The 88 Project, a group focused on human rights and free speech issues in Vietnam.",
      "\"Any challenge to the government and the Communist Party, any significant challenge to their official narrative of events, is perceived by them as a situation that is getting out of control,\" he said in an interview from Thailand.",
      "Among other things, the decree requires users to verify their accounts with phone numbers or national ID cards that must be provided to the government upon request, and for the social media companies to store their data in Vietnam.",
      "It also prevents social media users from engaging in citizen journalism or posting information about suspected government wrongdoing, and requires companies to remove posts deemed illegal within 24 hours. The decree requires companies to allow authorities access to their internal search engines so that it can identify offending content.",
      "Social media companies have until late March to be in compliance, and it is not yet clear whether they will try to push back. TikTok and Facebook refused to comment on their plans, while X and Google, which owns YouTube, did not return emails.",
      "Already, however, researchers have noticed a decline in political posts, Swanton said.",
      "\"In the last several years Hanoi has imprisoned or forced into exile the country's most prominent independent journalists, reformers, human rights activists, and dissidents.

      "Vietnamese authorities did not respond to a request for comment on the Project 88 analysis or the intent behind the new decree.",
      "About 65 million Vietnamese have Facebook accounts, roughly two-thirds of the population, and some 35 million have YouTube accounts. About half of Vietnam's people say they get most of their news from social media.",
      "Already, the government frequently insists critical posts from outside the country be geo-blocked so they cannot be accessed inside Vietnam and it has moved quickly to censor posts it deems unacceptable, like a video of a top minister eating a gold-encrusted steak in London in 2021 while Vietnam was on COVID-19 lockdown.",
      "In October, a prominent Vietnamese blogger was sentenced to 12 years in prison for articles and videos exposing the corruption of government officials, and in January, a prominent Vietnamese lawyer was sentenced to three years in jail for Facebook posts criticizing the country's former top judge.",
      "Project 88 researchers said the new decree will also give authorities better tools to go after those who just read or watch social media posts as well.",
      "They noted a case last June in which police in one province went through the profiles of 13,328 members of a Facebook group that had information deemed \"hostile to the state\" and identified 20 people in their province, went to their homes and demanded they leave the group.",
      "\"If implemented as intended, Decree 147 would likely make it less time consuming to identify members of groups like this and ensure that groups with anti-state content will be blocked in the country,\" the report said.",

    "story": [
      "Italian archaeologists recently uncovered a \"monumental necropolis\" that appeared to honor an elite class of people thousands of years ago, provincial officials announced this month.",
      "The ancient cemetery found in Trento, a northern Alpine city, includes at least 200 individual tombs, which experts believe date back to the early Iron Age, a pre-Roman period between the 9th and 6th centuries B.C.E., shedding new light on the history of the region. Excavators discovered the necropolis while carrying out restoration and development work on a historic building in the area, a project spearheaded by Trento's archaeological heritage office, said the city's provincial council in a news release unveiling what officials called an \"exceptional\" find.",
      "Prehistoric flooding from nearby rivers likely helped preserve the sprawling grave site, effectively sealing the sediment and allowing the burial ground to stay remarkably intact over the course of millennia, the council said. Archaeologists unearthed graves filled with \"grave goods,\" objects that in some cultures were traditionally buried with the dead as a sort of sacrificial gesture, as well as cremated human remains, about 8 meters, or around 24 feet, underground.",
      "Francesca Gerosa, the vice president and provincial councilor of culture in Trento, said the necropolis \"shows us a new history of the city\" in a statement translated from Italian. Gerosa noted the discovery offers a deeper look into Trento's past, as more than \"just a Roman city.\"",
      "\"We know how important the commitment to research and protection of the heritage of our roots is ... and here we are working intensely to bring to light a piece of history unknown to the city,\" she said.",
      "The complexity of the necropolis particularly intrigued archaeologists and researchers studying the burial ground. Tall limestone pillars were arranged vertically to mark individual graves, like headstones, each of which corresponded to a lithic box that served as the actual tomb. Archaeologists identified one \"main\" tomb, covered by a mound structure, along with the numerous others that concentrated the surrounding area over time.",
      "Earth and calcined bones were found inside the boxes, although not always in the ossuary vases that Roman civilizations were known to typically use for cremated remains. In some tombs, archaeologists also uncovered fibers that likely came from fabric originally wrapped around the ashes of the dead.",
      "Officials said the \"grave goods\" included decorative objects, weapons constructed from metal and other items made from amber and glass, which indicate the people who built the Trento necropolis were culturally influenced by, or otherwise connected to, other Italic groups of the time. Franco Marzatico, who led the excavation, suggested the still-unknown settlers may have contributed to the rise of the Etruscan civilization that thrived in the Alps later on.",
      "\"We have the possibility of recognizing the elite of a society that was evidently settled in the Trento basin,\" \u00a0Marzatico said in a statement, adding that the burial rituals represent power, privilege and status.",

      "\"It certainly humanizes Reynolds and Lively to have them out, showing their personalities that for years endeared them to fans.

      "\"Anytime you have this sort of divisive, public falling out\u2014especially when one or both parties have a devoted following and a high Q-score\u2014you often see a two-pronged, tactical approach\u2026 it's really the 'hokey pokey' of manipulating the court of public opinion: make yourself the victim, make someone else the bad guy, and in a near-simultaneous step, double down on how/why the public should like you. It's playing to both sides of the public sentiment and conscience: empathy and relatability,\" Eldridge said. \"That's not to say the couple are following this script, but it's certainly been followed by others and there are some data points to indicate a similar trend line in this case.\"",
      "Justin Baldoni sued Blake Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, for $400 million. (Evan Agostini/Invision/AP)",
      "Eldridge said Lively and Reynolds likely attended the \"SNL\" event because it was \"a star-studded, who's who of Hollywood dignitaries and celebrated iconic show alums from various decades. It was bound to get wall-to-wall coverage\u2014and presumably positive reviews\u2014so, on the surface, it seemed like a safe calculation.\"",
      "However, he said Reynolds' one-liner during the show \"might prove to be another question all together.\"",

      "For women in particular, Lake highlighted a few key issues the MAHA movement is likely to tackle.",
      "Pesticide exposure",
      "Exposure to glyphosate, an herbicide that is often sprayed on crops as a pesticide, could block the body\u2019s ability to fight off cancer, according to Lake.",
      "\"Not only does it strip minerals and key nutrients from our food, it also takes away key healing components that would prevent something like cancer from being formed,\" he noted.",

      "CHILDREN EXPOSED TO HIGHER FLUORIDE LEVELS FOUND TO HAVE LOWER IQS, STUDY REVEALS",
      "\"But if you look at things like fluoride and the deficiency of minerals in our food, and then you start to compound that with poor air quality, high stress, a lot of workload and family life and inability to make ends meet \u2026 it becomes a pretty big, noticeable problem,\" he said.",
      "Infertility and reproductive issues",

      "The birth rate in America has hit a historic low, according to research, as reproductive challenges in women arise. (iStock)",
      "\"We've normalized severe PMS,\" he said. \"I think a lot of women have figured [that it\u2019s] pretty common \u2013 having menstrual cramping right before a cycle or having debilitating pain or the inability to feel energized leading up to a cycle \u2026 But that's not normal stuff.\"",
      "AMERICANS ARE HAVING FEWER BABIES AS BIRTH RATE HITS HISTORIC LOW, CDC REVEALS",

      "PCOS is also linked to chronic inflammation, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine, which can then worsen insulin resistance.",

      "Unhealthy food choices",
      "Better food choices for Americans should start in schools and hospitals, Lake suggested, where decisions can be made to stop serving what\u2019s cheapest and start serving what\u2019s best for young children, elderly people and those with illnesses.",

      "Obesity and metabolic disease",
      "\"I think the No. 1 problem in America is the chronic disease of obesity,\" Prato said, largely due to \"insulin receptor sensitivity issues,\" which is when the body\u2019s cells become less responsive to insulin.",

      "Toxins and chemicals",
      "The third major health hazard, according to Prato, are the chemical toxins and heavy metals that are found in the food and water Americans consume, as well as the air they breathe.",
      "\"We keep adding pills, but we're not getting to the core of what's causing the disease.\"",
      "\"Our bodies are just not designed to detoxify or eliminate these problems,\" he said. \"We also know that chemical toxins are carcinogenic.\"",
      "Americans\u2019 food supply is a \"very important part\" of eliminating toxicity, Prato added. \"A lot of these foods we eat are laced with carcinogens.\"",
      "Barriers to good health",
      "The biggest obstacle that is keeping Americans from living healthier lives, Prato said, is lack of motivation to make changes.",
      "In many cases, he said, patients think they\u2019re healthy but just don\u2019t have the right information.",

      "Americans as a whole are also overly reliant on expensive medications as a way to manage chronic illnesses, according to Prato.",

      "Tech support scams have been around for years, but a new variant called the Phantom Hacker scam is rapidly gaining traction. It has cost victims, primarily older Americans, over $500 million since 2023. This scam is particularly deceptive because it unfolds in three carefully orchestrated phases and uses AI-powered social engineering tactics to avoid detection. Attackers leverage caller ID spoofing and AI-generated voices to make their scheme more persuasive, but there are ways to protect yourself.",

      "How the phantom hacker scam works",
      "As\u00a0highlighted by the FBI, the scam begins with the tech support impostor phase. You might receive a call, email, text or even a pop-up on your computer warning you that your device has been compromised. The message urges you to call a customer support number for assistance. Once you do, a scammer posing as\u00a0tech support claims that hackers have targeted your accounts. To \"help,\" they instruct you to download remote access software, allowing them to take control of your computer. Under the guise of scanning for threats, they trick you into revealing your financial accounts, setting up the next phase of the scam.",
      "Next comes the financial institution impostor phase. Another scammer, pretending to be from your bank or investment firm, calls to warn that a foreign hacker has infiltrated your accounts. They advise moving your money to a \"safe\" government-protected account, often using wire transfers, cryptocurrency or cash deposits. They might also insist on keeping the transaction confidential, claiming it\u2019s necessary for security reasons.",
      "In the final U.S. government impostor phase, a third scammer impersonates a federal official \u2013 often from the Federal Reserve \u2013 who pressures you to act quickly. If you start doubting the scheme, they may send you an official-looking email or document to convince you that the transfer is legitimate. By the time victims realize they\u2019ve been tricked, their money is gone, often sent overseas beyond the reach of U.S. authorities.",

      "SPOTIFY PLAYLISTS ARE BEING HIJACKED TO PROMOTE PIRATED SOFTWARE AND SCAMS",
      "How AI is making things worse",
      "AI is making scams like the Phantom Hacker scam more deceptive and harder to spot. Scammers are using AI-powered chatbots to automate their schemes. Instead of relying on human operators, they can now deploy AI-driven responses that sound natural and convincing.",
      "AI-generated\u00a0deepfake voices are also being used to impersonate bank officials and government representatives. With just a short audio sample, scammers can clone a voice to make their calls seem even more authentic. This means a victim might hear what sounds like their bank manager or an official from the Federal Reserve.",
      "Email scams are also becoming more sophisticated. AI tools can craft messages that mimic the tone and style of official communications. Scammers can even generate fake but realistic-looking documents with official letterheads to convince victims that the scam is legitimate.",

      "9 WAYS SCAMMERS CAN USE YOUR PHONE NUMBER TO TRY TO TRICK YOU",
      "7 ways to protect yourself",
      "The best way to defend yourself against the Phantom Hacker scam is to stay informed, be cautious and follow these steps:",
      "1) Ignore unsolicited messages: Scammers often send pop-ups, text messages or emails claiming that your computer is infected or that your bank account is at risk. These messages may look official, but they are designed to create panic and pressure you into taking immediate action. Never click on links or attachments from unknown senders, as they may contain malware or lead to phishing websites that steal your personal information.",
      "2)\u00a0Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Verify phone numbers before calling: If you receive an unexpected message urging you to call tech support, do not use the number provided in the message. Instead, visit the official website of the company in question and find their customer support contact information. Scammers often create fake websites or use\u00a0caller ID spoofing to make their phone numbers appear legitimate, so always double-check before making a call.",
      "4) Avoid downloading unknown software: No reputable company will ever ask you to install remote access tools unless you have specifically reached out for tech support. Scammers use these programs to take control of your computer, monitor your activity and access sensitive information. If someone unexpectedly asks you to download software to \"fix a problem\" or \"protect your account,\" it is likely a scam.",
      "5) Never give control of your device to a stranger: If you allow a scammer to remotely access your computer, they can view your personal files, log your keystrokes and manipulate your accounts without your knowledge. Legitimate customer support representatives will never request remote access unless you have initiated the support request through an official company channel. If someone insists on taking control of your device, hang up immediately.",
      "6) Be skeptical of urgent financial warnings: The U.S. government will never contact you unexpectedly and demand that you move your money to a \"safe account.\" They will also never ask you to wire funds, purchase gift cards or send cryptocurrency as a form of payment. Scammers create a false sense of urgency to trick victims into acting before they can think critically about the situation. If someone claims to be from a bank or government agency and pressures you to move money, stop and verify their identity through official channels.",
      "7) Invest in personal data removal services: Scammers often gather information from data broker websites to make their scams more convincing. Your name, phone number, home address and even financial history may be publicly available without your knowledge. Consider using a data removal service to regularly scan and request the removal of your personal information from these databases. This reduces the chances of scammers targeting you with highly personalized attacks. You can also manually opt out of major data broker sites, but using a service automates the process and keeps your information protected over time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

Because phishing apps require minimal code and fewer permissions than traditional malware, they are much easier to sneak onto app stores, including Google Play.",
      "Many phishing apps look like regular, fully functional software. Some impersonate games or utilities, while others appear as cracked versions of popular apps like TikTok, WhatsApp or Spotify. Some stay dormant for days to avoid detection before launching their attacks. Others rely on ad functionality to redirect users to phishing sites, making the malicious code harder to trace.",
      "Google Play Protect, which is built-in malware protection for Android devices, automatically removes known malware. However, it is important to note that Google Play Protect may not be enough. Historically, it isn't 100% foolproof at removing all known malware from Android devices.",

      "5 tips to protect your devices from malware",
      "Follow these essential tips to safeguard your devices from the latest malware threats, including the notorious info stealer malware.",
      "1. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Be cautious with downloads and links: Only download software from reputable sources such as the Mac App Store, Google Play Store or official websites of trusted developers. Be wary of unsolicited emails or messages prompting you to download or install updates, especially if they contain links.\u00a0Phishing attempts often disguise themselves as legitimate update notifications or urgent messages.",
      "3. Keep your software updated: Ensure that both macOS, Android and all installed applications are up to date. Apple and Android frequently release security patches and updates that address vulnerabilities. Enable automatic updates for macOS, Android and your apps to stay protected without having to manually check for updates. If you need more help, see my\u00a0guide on keeping all your devices updated.",
      "4. Use strong and unique passwords:\u00a0To protect your Mac from malware, it\u2019s also crucial to use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts and devices. Avoid reusing passwords across different sites or services. A\u00a0password manager can be incredibly helpful here. It generates and stores complex passwords for you, making them difficult for hackers to crack.",
      "It also keeps track of all your passwords in one place and automatically fills them in when you log into accounts, so you don\u2019t have to remember them yourself. By reducing the number of passwords you need to recall, you\u2019re less likely to reuse them, which lowers the risk of security breaches. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable\u00a02FA for your important accounts, including your Apple ID, Google account, email and any financial services. This adds an extra step to the login process, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have your password.",

      "The days when Mac users could assume they were safe are long gone. Cybercriminals are evolving their tactics, with Mac malware shifting from simple adware to advanced information stealers. Android phishing apps are also becoming harder to detect and more widespread than ever. From stealing passwords and authentication cookies to intercepting OTPs and draining cryptocurrency wallets, these threats are growing in both sophistication and scale. No platform is immune, and as cybercriminals continue refining their techniques, users and organizations must stay ahead with strong security measures.",

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'FOX & Friends' to warn of new cyberscams and his tips on how to avoid them.",
      "Cyberscams have reached alarming levels in the U.S., with nearly 30% of Americans falling victim to fraudulent schemes in the past year alone.",
      "The financial toll is staggering \u2014 scams cost Americans over $159 billion annually, with average individual losses now exceeding $3,500 per victim. This epidemic is not just a financial crisis but also a human rights issue, as many scams originate from forced labor operations in Southeast Asia.",
      "With nearly 90% of Americans targeted by scam attempts and 40% receiving suspicious messages daily, the question remains: how can we protect ourselves and hold perpetrators accountable in an increasingly digital world?",
      "STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS \u2014 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S THE CYBERGUY REPORT NOW",
      "The word scam with data in the background\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The mechanics of \"pig butchering\"",
      "One of the most pervasive scams today is the so-called \"pig butchering\" scheme. Originating in China and spreading across Southeast Asia, this scam involves criminals building trust with victims through social media or messaging apps. Once trust is established, victims are lured into fraudulent cryptocurrency investment schemes. These scams are meticulously crafted to appear legitimate, often involving fake trading platforms and simulated profits. Victims are encouraged to invest more until they are \"slaughtered,\" losing their\u00a0entire savings when the scammers vanish with their funds.",
      "9 WAYS SCAMMERS CAN USE YOUR PHONE NUMBER TO TRY TO TRICK YOU",
      "Forced labor behind these scam centers",
      "What makes these scams even more horrifying is their reliance on human trafficking. Criminal syndicates in countries like Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos force trafficked individuals to run these operations under threat of violence. These \"scam centers\" operate in lawless regions controlled by rebel groups or corrupt officials, making international intervention challenging. Survivors describe conditions akin to modern slavery, with physical abuse and even torture being common.",
      "Illustration of a scam on a computer key. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "BEST PRESIDENT\u2019S DAY DEALS",
      "Why America is a prime target",
      "Cyberscams have taken hold in the U.S. for several reasons that make it particularly vulnerable. As an American, you\u2019re likely connected to the digital world through social media platforms, messaging apps and other online tools. This high level of connectivity makes it easier for scammers to reach you directly, whether through a text message, email or social media chat. The sheer number of people online in the U.S. creates a vast pool of potential targets for cybercriminals.",
      "Additionally, the growing popularity of cryptocurrency in the U.S. has made it a\u00a0prime medium for fraud. Cryptocurrency transactions are fast, anonymous and difficult to trace, which makes them ideal for scammers looking to steal funds without leaving a trail. Many scams are designed to exploit this lack of transparency, leaving victims with little chance of recovering their money once it\u2019s gone.",
      "Another major issue is the lack of a centralized reporting system for cyberscams in the U.S. If you\u2019ve ever been scammed or know someone who has, you might have noticed how confusing it can be to figure out where to report the crime \u2014 whether to the FBI, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or another agency. This fragmented system not only makes it harder for victims to seek help but also prevents authorities from gathering comprehensive data to tackle the problem effectively. These factors combined have made Americans some of the most targeted individuals in the world when it comes to cyberscams.",

      "Several countries have implemented innovative measures to combat cyberscams, offering valuable lessons for the U.S. Singapore, for instance, has introduced a mandatory SMS Sender ID Registry (SSIR) that requires organizations to register their alphanumeric Sender IDs. This system effectively blocks unregistered SMS senders, significantly reducing impersonation scams. In fact, cases involving scam SMSes in Singapore fell by 70% over three months after mandating the SSIR.",
      "Britain has taken a different approach by establishing a dedicated \"159\" hotline, allowing residents to instantly verify suspicious calls. This simple yet effective system provides a quick way for individuals to check the legitimacy of unexpected communications, potentially preventing many scams before they occur.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Many nations have also implemented stricter authentication measures, such as biometric checks and in-app verifications, which have proven highly effective in reducing fraud. For example, Singapore has required facial verification for higher-risk transactions through Singpass since 2022, resulting in no further reports of malware-enabled scams involving unauthorized CPF withdrawals since its implementation in June 2023.",
      "Some countries are exploring ways to slow down cryptocurrency transactions or cap transfer amounts, which could significantly hinder scammers who rely on quick, anonymous transfers. These measures, combined with a coordinated global response involving major victim nations like the U.S. and China, could prove instrumental in dismantling criminal networks more effectively. By learning from these international examples and adapting them to the American context, the U.S. could significantly strengthen its defenses against the rising tide of cyberscams.",

      "2. Limit personal information sharing: Avoid sharing personal or financial information over the phone, email or online unless you are certain of the recipient's identity and legitimacy.",
      "3. Use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts:\u00a0A robust password should include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. Avoid reusing passwords across multiple platforms, and consider using a reputable\u00a0password manager to store and generate complex passwords securely.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible:\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method, such as a code sent to your phone or biometric authentication. This ensures that even if your password is compromised, unauthorized access remains highly unlikely.",
      "5. Keep your devices and software up to date:\u00a0By regularly installing the\u00a0latest updates and security patches, you can ensure your devices are equipped with the latest security features and bug fixes, reducing the risk of becoming a target for cyberattacks. Many cyberattacks exploit unpatched vulnerabilities, so enabling automatic updates for your operating system, apps and antivirus software can significantly reduce your risk.",

      "7. Monitor financial accounts: Regularly check your bank and credit card statements for any unusual or unauthorized transactions. Promptly report any suspicious activity.",

      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson walks you through the process.",
      "Every tech expert will tell you the App Store is safer than Google Play Store. Some might even claim it is impossible to download a malicious app from the App Store, but they are wrong.",
      "While I admit the App Store is a secure and tightly controlled ecosystem, it cannot completely shield you. Security researchers have found that hackers are targeting several apps on the App Store to spread malware that steals information from screenshots saved on a device.",
      "The issue also affects those downloading apps from the Google Play Store.",

      "A person holding an iPhone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson\u00a0)",
      "How the malware works and what makes it different",
      "According to\u00a0researchers at Kaspersky, this malware campaign is more advanced than typical info stealers, both in how it works and how it spreads. Instead of relying on social engineering tricks to get users to grant permissions like most banking trojans or spyware, this malware hides inside seemingly legitimate apps and slips past Apple and Google\u2019s security checks.",
      "One of its standout features is Optical Character Recognition. Instead of stealing stored files, it scans screenshots saved on the device, extracts text and sends the information to remote servers.",
      "Once installed, the malware operates stealthily, often activating only after a period of dormancy to avoid raising suspicion. It employs encrypted communication channels to send stolen data back to its operators, making it difficult to trace. Plus, it spreads through deceptive updates or hidden code within app dependencies, an approach that helps it evade initial security screenings by app store review teams.",
      "The infection vectors vary between Apple and Google\u2019s ecosystems. On iOS, the malware is often embedded within apps that initially pass Apple\u2019s rigorous review process but later introduce harmful functionality through updates. On Android, the malware can exploit sideloading options, but even official Google Play apps have been found to carry these malicious payloads, sometimes hidden within SDKs (software development kits) supplied by third-party developers.",
      "Messaging app in the App Store designed to lure victims.",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "What's being stolen, and who's responsible?",
      "The scope of stolen information is alarming. This malware primarily targets crypto wallet recovery phrases but is also capable of exfiltrating login credentials, payment details, personal messages, location data and even biometric identifiers. Some versions are designed to harvest authentication tokens, allowing attackers to access accounts even if users change their passwords.",
      "The apps serving as malware carriers include ComeCome, ChatAi, WeTink, AnyGPT and more. These range from productivity tools to entertainment and utility apps. In some cases, malicious developers create these apps with full knowledge of the malware\u2019s purpose. In others, the issue appears to be a supply chain vulnerability, where legitimate developers unknowingly integrate compromised SDKs or third-party services that introduce malicious code into their applications.",
      "We reached out to Apple for a comment but did not hear back before our deadline.",
      "Messaging app in the App Store designed to lure victims. (Kaspersky)",
      "Apple's response to screenshot-scanning malware discovered in App Store",
      "Apple has removed the 11 iOS apps mentioned in Kaspersky's report from the App Store. Furthermore, they discovered that these 11 apps shared code signatures with 89 other iOS apps, all of which had been previously rejected or removed for violating Apple's policies, resulting in the termination of their developer accounts.",
      "Apps requesting access to user data such as Photos, Camera or Location must provide relevant functionality or face rejection. They must also clearly explain their data usage when prompting users for permission. iOS privacy features ensure users always control whether their location information is shared with an app. Also, starting in iOS 14, the PhotoKit API \u2014 which allows apps to request access to a user\u2019s Photos library \u2014 added additional controls to let users select only specific photos or videos to share with an app instead of providing access to their entire library.",
      "The App Store Review Guidelines mandate that developers are responsible for ensuring their entire app, including ad networks, analytics services and third-party SDKs, complies with the guidelines. Developers must carefully review and choose these components. Apps must also accurately represent their privacy practices, including those of the SDKs they use, in their privacy labels.",
      "In 2023, the App Store rejected over 1.7 million app submissions for failing to meet its stringent privacy, security and content standards. It also rejected 248,000 app submissions found to be spam, copycats or misleading and prevented 84,000 potentially fraudulent apps from reaching users.",

Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Installing strong antivirus software can add an extra layer of protection by scanning apps for malware, blocking suspicious activity and alerting you to potential threats. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Stick to trusted developers and well-known apps:\u00a0Even though malware has been found in official app stores, users can still minimize their risk by downloading apps from reputable developers with a long track record. Before installing an app, check its developer history, read multiple reviews and look at the permissions it requests. If an app from an unknown developer suddenly gains popularity but lacks a strong review history, approach it with caution.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Review app permissions carefully:\u00a0Many malicious apps disguise themselves as legitimate tools but request excessive permissions that go beyond their stated purpose. For example, a simple calculator app should not need access to your contacts, messages or location. If an app asks for permissions that seem unnecessary, consider it a red flag and either deny those permissions or avoid installing the app altogether. Go to your phone settings and check app permissions on your\u00a0iPhone and\u00a0Android.",
      "4. Keep your device and apps updated:\u00a0Cybercriminals exploit vulnerabilities in outdated software to distribute malware. Always\u00a0keep your operating system and apps updated to the latest versions, as these updates often contain critical security patches. Enabling automatic updates ensures that you stay protected without having to manually check for new versions.",
      "5. Be wary of apps that promise too much:\u00a0Many malware-infected apps lure users by offering features that seem too good to be true \u2014 such as free premium services, extreme battery optimizations or AI-powered functionality that appears unrealistic. If an app\u2019s claims sound exaggerated or its download numbers skyrocket overnight with questionable reviews, it\u2019s best to avoid it. Stick to apps with a transparent development team and verifiable functionalities.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The new malware campaign highlights the need for stricter vetting processes, continuous monitoring of app behavior post-approval and greater transparency from app stores regarding security risks. While Apple and Google have removed the malicious apps upon detection, the fact that they made it onto the platform in the first place exposes a gap in the existing security framework. As cybercriminals refine their methods, app stores must evolve just as quickly or risk losing the trust of the very users they claim to protect.",

And I'll point out that much of the European aid is actually in the form of a loan. That is repaid. It's repaid with interest on Russian assets. So President Trump is rethinking the entire dynamic here. That has some people uncomfortable, but I think Zelenskyy would be very wise to enter into this agreement with the United States. There's no better way to secure them going forward, and further, there was a question of whether Putin would come to the table. He has now done so under President Trump's leadership, and we're going to continue those talks in the coming weeks at President Trump's direction.\"",

      "\u201cUSAID, DEI grants, and education administration are more culture war targets than centerpieces of a true deficit reduction agenda,\u201d said Jessica Riedl, a budget expert and senior fellow at the center-right Manhattan Institute. \u201cSerious deficit reduction requires addressing the 75% of spending going to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, defense, veterans, and interest on the debt. Yet Trump has taken nearly all of those deficit drivers off the table for savings.\u201d",
      "When it comes to Social Security and Medicare, Trump called for tackling \u201cthe theft and the bad management of entitlements\u201d last year, while promising not to jeopardize benefits.",
      "But the president and Musk have yet to show evidence of fraud that would bend the cost curve. An inspector general audit last year found that the error rate in Social Security benefits was 0.84% from fiscal 2015 to 2022 \u2014 a total of $71.8 billion in improper payments, \u201cmost of which were overpayments,\u201d out of $8.6 trillion total.",
      "\u201cTo extend the tax cuts and still balance the budget in Trump\u2019s term would require eliminating 30 percent of the federal budget,\u201d Riedl said. \u201cIncorporating Trump\u2019s promise not to cut Social Security, Medicare would mean that half of all remaining spending must be eliminated to achieve balance. Congress is not going to approve that.\u201d",
      "Rep. Kevin Hern, R-Okla., defended the tax agenda, saying \u201cit\u2019s what the president got elected on.\u201d He said it\u2019s still a work in progress how Republicans offset the cost of extending his 2017 tax cuts that expire at the end of this year.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re working on right now,\u201d Hern said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re spending at twice the rate of what your revenue growth is, that\u2019s a problem.\u201d",
      "Some in the GOP say extending the lapsing Trump tax cuts shouldn\u2019t count as red ink. Still, Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, warned: \u201cWe should be careful with things like that \u2014 that can get kind of gimmicky.\u201d",
      "Further complicating matters, Republican leaders are eyeing a substantial increase to the $825 billion military budget this year \u2014 the House is pushing for a $100 billion boost, while the Senate calls for a $150 billion spending increase for the Pentagon. And they\u2019re looking at about $150 billion, if not more, in new money for border security and stepped-up immigration enforcement.",
      "Democrats say that Trump, who called himself the \u201cking of debt\u201d during his first campaign, is bamboozling voters with a push for tax cuts that disproportionately benefit upper earners.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump and his co-President Musk could fully eliminate all spending on foreign aid and education, and they still wouldn\u2019t come even close to balancing the budget. Add the Trump tax cuts for billionaires and that will add trillions more to our debt,\u201d said Rep. Brendan Boyle, D-Pa., the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee. \u201cThe money we spend on foreign aid is a shiny penny that Trump is using to distract people from the gold coins that go to tax cuts for his billionaire buddies.\u201d",
      "As Senate Republicans voted Tuesday night to begin advancing their budget resolution, one member of the caucus voted no: Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who warned that its \u201cunstated purpose is to increase spending by $342 billion.\u201d"

    "summary": "The number of detainees in ICE custody without a conviction or pending criminal charges increased by more than 1,800 in the first two weeks of February.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has promised to prioritize the \u201cworst first\u201d when it comes to arrests and deportations, but the number of detainees in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody without a criminal conviction or pending criminal charges increased by more than 1,800 in the first two weeks of February, representing 41% of the 4,422 total new detainees in that period, according to new data obtained by NBC News.",
      "During federal fiscal year 2024, the Biden administration made 113,431 immigration arrests, and of those, only 28% were of people who had no criminal convictions or pending criminal charges.",
      "Asked for comment on the data, Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman, said immigrants without criminal records are often \u201cfar from innocent\u201d but declined to provide further data.",
      "The new detention data from ICE, which is a snapshot from late last week, shows that its detention centers are at the upper limits of their capacity. The number of people detained went from 39,238 in early February to 41,169 in mid-February. ICE\u2019s detention capacity nationwide is 41,500. It\u2019s unclear how many people who had been in detention were deported or were released through the Alternatives to Detention monitoring program during these two weeks.",
      "NBC News previously\u00a0reported\u00a0that President Donald Trump was frustrated by the slow pace of immigrant arrests and deportations, and that two top ICE officials were\u00a0demoted\u00a0in response.",
      "One factor in the pace has been the lack of detention space in ICE facilities. And the new data paints a much clearer picture of the dilemma that administration officials face as they try to clear out existing detainees to make room for more new arrestees.",
      "According to the data, only 13% of those currently in ICE detention are on track for \u201cexpedited removal,\u201d a designation indicating they can be deported without having a court hearing. The remaining 87% are facing deportation proceedings which could last for months or even years.",
      "Immigration courts are facing a backlog of 3.6 million cases and, as a result, some pending cases may not be heard for years. At least 16,000 current ICE detainees have notices to appear in court, which means they are waiting for a court date.",
      "To relieve space, the administration is now using new detention locations in Texas and Kentucky. It is also seeking to expand detention capacity available to its Denver field office, which includes Colorado and Wyoming, by at least 900 beds, according to new public documents.",
      "The Trump administration has also begun transferring immigration detainees to Guantanamo Bay, where it eventually plans to hold as many as 30,000 people. It has already brought 112 detainees there, and more flights are in the works.",
      "The total number of detainees with criminal convictions or pending criminal charges arrested by ICE and currently in detention did rise over the last two weeks, going up 18% in the last two weeks, from about 14,000 to more than 16,500.",
      "The administration\u2019s public messaging continues to center around alleged criminality. ICE\u2019s page on X highlights the arrests of people it says have been convicted of murder, domestic violence, manslaughter, theft, child pornography and other crimes.",
      "Detainee demographics",
      "The new detainees are overwhelmingly male, a consistent trend. Just 22 female detainees were booked over the last two weeks, according to the data: 11 with criminal convictions or charges, and 11 without.",
      "Available data on total ICE arrests during the Trump administration is less precise. ICE had been posting daily arrest totals to X in the early days of the Trump's second term, but that effort stopped Feb. 1.\u00a0It\u2019s unclear if the average number of arrests per day is still surpassing the Biden administration\u2019s average of 282 in September 2024, the most recent month from which data is available.",
      "A dashboard that ICE launched in December 2023 that summarized arrests, deportation and detention data has not been updated since September 2024.",
      "The federal government has also stopped tracking the number of transgender people in ICE detention, which was a part of its previous data collection efforts. Data from mid-January showed 47 transgender detainees in ICE facilities."

What he may not understand is this is President Trump has grown our party. He\u2019s brought in the unions.\u201d",

But you can work past those and still have a good relationship.\u201d",
      "Senate Republican leaders have not said whether Chavez-DeRemer will get a floor vote if she fails in committee.",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the ranking member of the HELP Committee, told NBC News last week that he had met with Chavez-DeRemer. But he wouldn\u2019t say whether he supports her.",

      "Edward Kelley was the fourth rioter to breach the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and was convicted of assaulting law enforcement and other charges after a trial in Washington last year in which the FBI alleged that he was\u00a0armed with a handgun when he breached the Capitol. Kelley was then separately convicted by a federal jury in Tennessee of conspiracy to murder employees of the United States, solicitation to commit a crime of violence and influencing or retaliating against federal officials by threat.",

      "But Kelley\u2019s attorney had argued\u00a0that President Donald Trump\u2019s mass pardon of Jan. 6 rioters should apply to Kelley\u2019s conviction in the murder plot because it \u201cdirectly relates to the events at the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021.\u201d",

      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hit back at Donald Trump's accusation overnight that Ukraine started its war with Russia, saying that the American president is trapped in a \u201cdisinformation bubble\u201d and adding that his country was not for sale.",
      "The pugnacious response followed Trump\u2019s surprising comments Tuesday that Ukraine was responsible for Russia\u2019s invasion of the country three years ago. Trump also argued that Kyiv could have made a deal to avoid the conflict.",

      "He added that any attempts to replace him during the war would fail \u2014 Trump raised the question of Ukrainian elections following Russian President Vladimir Putin's repeated assertions that Zelenskyy is not Ukraine's legitimate leader \u2014 contending that the overwhelming majority of Ukrainians would not support concessions to Russia.",
      "\u201cThe army is quite resilient, and it is the most resilient in Europe ... and it guarantees us the opportunity to speak with dignity and on an equal footing with other partners \u2014 allies or non-allies,\u201d Zelenskyy said.",

      "The U.S. president is, \u201cthe first, and so far, apparently, the only Western leader who has publicly and loudly said that one of the root causes of the Ukrainian situation was the brazen path of the previous administration to draw Ukraine into NATO,\u201d Lavrov said. \u201cNo Western leader has ever said this,\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is already a signal that he understands our position,\u201d Lavrov added, in a speech that covered the broader second Trump administration rather than the president\u2019s specific remarks on Tuesday.",
      "The Kremlin will also have been pleased with Trump's comment that Ukrainians may be asking about the status of the country's next election.",
      "In doing so, the president echoed the criticisms of Vladimir Putin, who has ruled Russia for all but four of the past 25 years, but has repeatedly questioned the electoral legitimacy of Zelenskyy\u2019s continuing leadership.",
      "Ukraine last held a presidential election in 2019 and was due to have held one last April, but Zelenskyy has said in the past that it is not possible for Ukrainians to go to the polls in wartime and that view is also backed up by the country\u2019s constitution.",

      "A little more than six months removed from winning an Olympic gold medal in the men\u2019s 100 meter and claiming the title of \"fastest man alive,\" American sprinter Noah Lyles is welcoming a new challenge this year: racing Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill.",
      "After trading barbs and trash talk for months, Lyles and Hill announced their intention to run against each other for real earlier this month. And Lyles is taking the opportunity seriously.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not here to play around,\u201d Lyles told NBC News. \u201cI\u2019m dead serious about this. I\u2019m going to bring everything I got for this.\u201d",
      "Lyles, 27, won gold in Paris with a thrilling finish in the 100 meter, defeating Jamaica\u2019s Kishane Thompson by a fraction of a second. Only eight days after the race, Hill \u2014 known as arguably the fastest receiver in the NFL \u2014 was asked on a podcast if he could beat Lyles in a race. He didn't hesitate to say yes.",
      "The two have exchanged shots since. Lyles escalated the beef when he held up a \"Tyreek could never\" sign after winning the 60-meter race at the New Balance Indoor Grand Prix on Feb 2.",
      "Lyles said he and Hill actually spoke to each other for the first time following the Indoor Grand Prix. In brief phone conversations, both athletes affirmed they were serious about facing off on the track and finally agreed to race.",
      "And in those conversations with Hill, Lyles says he made it clear not to mistake his trash talk for light heartedness.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want you to think that I\u2019m just out here joking,\u201d Lyles said of his message to the Dolphins receiver.\u00a0\u201cLet me be confident saying this. I\u2019m your guy. I\u2019m your guy who\u2019s gonna to let you swing, but best believe I will dodge and you will get hit with an uppercut.\u201d",
      "Hill, to his credit, isn\u2019t backing down from his decorated opponent, telling NBC Sports in February that Lyles \u201cshould be scared\u201d of him in a 40-yard dash.",
      "The event is not without its detractors, as some are calling it a \u201chuge mistake\u201d for a runner of Lyles\u2019s caliber to entertain Hill\u2019s challenge. But Lyles says a motivation is to bring more eyeballs to the sport outside of the Olympics, which only takes place once every four years.",
      "\u201cSomething that\u2019s constantly on my mind is how to keep track relevant,\u201d Lyles said. \u201cTrack and field has a great reputation inside of the Olympics, but in the marketing sense, when it comes to the U.S., it\u2019s just fallen short a few too many times.\u201d",
      "Lyles thinks his race against Hill could be a way to build enthusiasm for the sport.",
      "\u201cI get a lot of hate from people who don\u2019t believe that I should be racing him. And they\u2019re like, 'this is beneath you',\u201d he says. \u2018Well, apparently it\u2019s not, because here we are.\u201d",
      "As great of a runner Lyles is, he may be equally adept at drawing attention. He says he\u2019s been doing that dating back to the eighth grade, when he\u2019d try to draw \u201cooohs and aaahs\u201d from the crowd with antics before and after races.",
      "That streak of showmanship has followed Lyles to the Olympics and beyond. In June of last year, he brought Yu-Gi-Oh!\u00a0cards with him to the U.S. trials and even kept a rare one in his singlet. In Paris, Snoop Dogg wore a shirt with Lyles\u2019s face on it to one of his races.",
      "\u201cI want to be more than just a runner because there\u2019s enough runners,\" he said. \"But who\u2019s the performers?\u201d",
      "Most details of the race against Hill are still up in the air \u2014 most importantly length and location \u2014 though Lyles mentioned 60 meters and New York City's Times Square as possibilities. The summer is also likely for timing, as Lyles will be deep in training for U.S. championships and Hill will be gearing up for the NFL season.",
      "And as far as nerves go, Lyles says the only thing that could make him underperform is fans not getting excited enough.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m more thinking about, 'dang, I have an opportunity to break the world record along with beating Tyreek',\u201d Lyles said. \"So Tyreek better be ready, because if a world record gets dropped on his head, he ain\u2019t gonna be able to hear nothing.\u201d"

      "Macquarie Harbor was also the site of the worst mass stranding in Australian history in 2020, when fewer than 100 pilot whales survived out of 470 that became stuck on sandbars.Beachings can occur for a variety of reasons including navigation errors, sickness, old age, injury, bad weather and hunting too close to shore."

      "Eleven women filed civil lawsuits Tuesday against luxury real estate stars Oren and Tal Alexander and their brother, Alon, alleging the men sexually assaulted them in New York, Miami and Moscow.",
      "The burst of complaints is the latest in a growing number of accusations from women who allege they were sexually attacked by one or more of the brothers. The suits filed in New York included allegations of drugging, rape and sexual assault from 2011 to 2019. All but one of the suits filed Tuesday were filed by Jane Does.",
      "In December, federal prosecutors indicted Tal, 38, and his twin brothers, Oren and Alon, 37, on sex trafficking charges.",
      "They pleaded not guilty and remain in federal custody pending trial.",
      "Earlier this month, federal prosecutors said they have spoken to more than 60 alleged victims of the men and plan to file a superseding indictment in their case against the brothers, according to a hearing transcript.",
      "The Miami-Dade State Attorney filed felony sexual battery charges in December against the twins and another man in three alleged incidents involving three women. The twins pleaded not guilty.",
      "In an emailed statement through his attorney, Alon Alexander denied the allegations Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThe only sexual encounters I have had in my lifetime have been consensual and legal,\u201d the statement said. \u201cI have never drugged a woman, nor have I ever had sex with a woman who I believed was drugged.\u201d",
      "Deanna Paul, an attorney for Tal, said Tuesday that he is an \u201ceasy target for so-called accusers who will fabricate stories for financial benefit\u201d and \u201cthis transparent attempt at a cash grab will fail and we expect these frivolous lawsuits, filed days before the law is set to expire, will also be dismissed.\u201d",
      "Paul said a federal court dismissed one civil case against the brothers in January because of a statute of limitations issue.",
      "Lawyers for Oren didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Andrew Van Arsdale of AVA Law Group, who with Curis Law represents the 11 women who filed suits Tuesday, said the filings showed \u201cthe scope and breadth of the havoc and just total disregard for the women around them that these brothers exhibited over the past decade.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey were just so incredibly brutal in their assaults and just taking whatever they wanted,\u201d Van Arsdale said. \u201cWe are doing everything we can to try and get some level of accountability, some form of justice for these women.\u201d",
      "Tal and Oren were named as defendants on Tuesday in four lawsuits each and face two lawsuits together. In those suits, two women allege that the brothers took turns raping them in incidents in 2011 and 2013. One complaint was filed against Alon.",
      "In seven of the 11 suits, the women alleged they were offered drug-laced drinks and were sexually attacked, according to the court documents.",
      "Leah Peters is the only named woman in Tuesday\u2019s suits, and she said in her suit that she was raped by Oren Alexander in 2018.",
      "Peters stated in that suit that she met Oren at a party at a luxury home in Miami and he offered to give her a tour. Oren later led Peters to a room where he \u201csuddenly and aggressively threw her onto the bed,\u201d the suit said. Peters said that she objected, but alleged that Oren \u201coverpowered\u201d and assaulted her. Oren then scrubbed her in the shower and escorted her back to the party, according to the complaint.",
      "Another lawsuit filed Tuesday said that in 2014 Tal invited a woman to his apartment for a date before an event. When the woman arrived, he \u201caggressively\u201d kissed and pulled her toward his bedroom and raped her, the filing said. After the alleged assault, he got up and \u201cpointed to a tuxedo hanging near his bathroom, and stated he had an event to attend. Defendant told Plaintiff to see herself out\u2019 and then entered the shower, dismissing her presence,\u201d according to the documents.",
      "The lawsuits were filed under an extension of the Violation of New York City Victims of Gender-Motivated Violence Protection Act, which allows survivors of gender-based violence to bring claims that would have been previously barred by the statute of limitations.",

      "Seven men have been charged in connection with a nationwide spree of burglaries that victimized high-profile athletes, including Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes, federal officials said Tuesday.",
      "The charge of conspiracy to commit interstate transportation of stolen property for each of the seven is in a criminal complaint filed Jan. 30 but announced by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Florida on Tuesday.",
      "The complaint adds four defendants to three previously alleged to be connected to such burglaries nationwide: Jordan Quiroga Sanchez, 22; Bastian Orellano Morales, 23; and Sergio Ortega Cabello, 38.",
      "The four other defendants are Pablo Zuniga Cartes, 24; Ignacio Zuniga Cartes, 20; Alexander Huiaguil Chavez, 24; and Bastian Jimenez Freraut, 27.",
      "It's not clear if any of the defendants have obtained lawyers. The federal public defender in Tampa, Florida, where the case was filed, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday night.",
      "Four of the defendants \u2014 Cabello, Chavez, Morales and Sanchez \u2014 pleaded not guilty to initial charges in Ohio of participating in a criminal gang, engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, obstructing official business and possession of criminal tools, according to court records.",
      "In its statement, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Middle District of Florida alleged the seven were part of a South American burglary crew that victimized high-profile athletes across the nation. All the defendants are from Chile.",
      "If convicted, each could spend as much as 10 years in federal prison, prosecutors said.",
      "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Florida said the defendants were connected to burglaries that resulted in the theft of $2 million in goods.",
      "Without specifically identifying the victims, the office used language that indicated the early October burglaries at the homes of Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and quarterback Patrick Mahomes were part of the spree, saying that the Kansas City-area residences of two Chiefs players were burglarized Oct. 5 and Oct. 7.",
      "Additionally, according to the statement, the seven are also connected to the Nov. 2, 2024, break-in at the Wisconsin home of a Milwaukee Bucks player while he was at work at a game. Watches, chains, jewelry, a designer suitcase, designer bags, cash and a safe securing some of those items, together worth nearly $1.5 million, were stolen, the office said.",
      "The information corresponds to a burglary at the home of Bucks forward Bobby Portis Jr.",
      "Pablo Zuniga Cartes, Ignacio Zuniga Cartes, Freraut and a fourth person not named posed for a photo with the safe and some of the goods afterward, the office alleged in its statement.",
      "The office alleged another burglary, a Dec. 9 Cincinnati area break-in, victimized a Cincinnati Bengals player, taking an estimated $300,000 in goods, the office said in its statement. The information corresponds to the burglary of the residence of Joe Burrow, who was in Arlington, Texas, helping his team beat the Dallas Cowboys 27-20 at the time.",
      "The U.S. Attorney's Office alleged defendant Cabello rented the vehicle used in the Ohio burglary.",
      "Also victimized were a Memphis Grizzlies basketball player whose home was breached Dec. 20 while he played a home game and the Oct. 21 break-in at the home of a Tampa Bay Buccaneers player.",
      "According to the filing, suspects gained entry to the home of the Buccaneers player by breaking through a window, stealing jewelry, Rolex watches, a Louis Vuitton suitcase and a firearm worth more than $167,000.",
      "In that case and that of the Grizzlies player, identities of the victims have not been made public.",
      "In all the cases connected to the seven, the U.S. Attorney's Office said, athletes were \"away or playing in professional games at the times of the burglaries.\"",
      "Since fall of last year, the NFL, the NBA and the FBI have warned high-profile athletes about burglars who have targeted the homes of star players.",
      "But authorities from San Diego County to New York City have probed and prosecuted similar cases they say are connected to a spree of coast-to-coast burglaries that target homes of the wealthy \u2014 athletes, celebrities and just plain rich people \u2014 and are believed to be carried out by South American criminal crews.",
      "In announcing the successful prosecution last year of defendants from Chile and Italy who burglarized a home on the coast of Southern California, San Diego District Attorney Summer Stephan said the defendants came to the United States for \"burglary tourism.\"",
      "Todd Spitzer, the district attorney of Orange County, California, has said a U.S. Visa Waiver program, the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA), too easily lets criminals enter the united states on a 90-day pass. The automated system grants citizens of 42 nations permission to enter and stay with relative ease.",
      "\u201cFor the last 18 months, I have been sounding the alarm about a dangerous loophole in the ESTA Visa Waiver program that is being exploited by organized crime rings from Chile to enter the United States unlimited times over a two-year period without background checks,\u201d Spitzer said in January.",
      "\u201cThese criminals aren\u2019t coming to the United States to visit Disneyland,\u201d he said.",

      "Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet alleges that Bolsonaro and 33 others participated in a plan to remain in power. The alleged plot, he wrote, included a plan to poison Lula and shoot dead Supreme Court Justice\u00a0Alexandre de Moraes, a foe of the former president.",
      "\u201cThe members of the criminal organization structured a plan at the presidential palace to attack institutions, aiming to bring down the system of the powers and the democratic order, which received the sinister name of \u2018Green and Yellow Dagger,\u2019\u201d Gonet wrote in a 272-page indictment. \u201cThe plan was conceived and taken to the knowledge of the president, and he agreed to it.\u201d",

      "\u201cIn all the areas these gangs are present, the population refuses completely for the militia to speak for them or to impose a \u2018New Sudan,\u2019\u201d he added."

    "story": [
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hit back at Donald Trump's accusation overnight that Ukraine started its war with Russia, saying that the American president is trapped in a \u201cdisinformation bubble\u201d and adding that his country was not for sale.",
      "The pugnacious response followed Trump\u2019s surprising comments Tuesday that Ukraine was responsible for Russia\u2019s invasion of the country three years ago. Trump also argued that Kyiv could have made a deal to avoid the conflict.",
      "The president added that his Ukrainian counterpart's approval ratings sat at 4% in Ukraine \u2014 despite an opinion poll released Wednesday by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology showing that 57% of Ukrainians trust Zelenskyy.",
      "\u201cAs we are talking about 4%, we have seen this disinformation, we understand it\u2019s coming from Russia,\u201d Zelenskyy told a news conference in Kyiv Wednesday, as he dismissed Trump\u2019s claim.",
      "He added that any attempts to replace him during the war would fail \u2014 Trump raised the question of Ukrainian elections following Russian President Vladimir Putin's repeated assertions that Zelenskyy is not Ukraine's legitimate leader \u2014 contending that the overwhelming majority of Ukrainians would not support concessions to Russia.",
      "\u201cThe army is quite resilient, and it is the most resilient in Europe ... and it guarantees us the opportunity to speak with dignity and on an equal footing with other partners \u2014 allies or non-allies,\u201d Zelenskyy said.",
      "Referring to U.S. support given to Ukraine so far \u2014 $67 billion in weapons and $31.5 billion in budgetary support \u2014 Zelenskyy said that American demands that Ukraine should hand over $500 billion in minerals was \u201cnot a serious conversation\u201d and added that he cannot sell his country.",
      "Zelenskyy's statements came the day after President Trump responded to remarks the Ukrainian leader had made earlier about not wanting \u201canyone making decisions behind our backs.\u201d",
      "Speaking to reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort late Tuesday, Trump said he believed he had the power to end the war in Ukraine, \"but today I heard, \u2018Oh, well, we weren\u2019t invited.\u2019 Well, you\u2019ve been there for three years.\u201d",

      "The reaction in Moscow to the broader change in direction of U.S. foreign policy has been more upbeat. Speaking to Russian lawmakers on Wednesday, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov did not directly address Trump's comments but he suggested the Kremlin was pleased with talks so far.",
      "The U.S. president is, \u201cthe first, and so far, apparently, the only Western leader who has publicly and loudly said that one of the root causes of the Ukrainian situation was the brazen path of the previous administration to draw Ukraine into NATO,\u201d Lavrov said. \u201cNo Western leader has ever said this,\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is already a signal that he understands our position,\u201d Lavrov added, in a speech that covered the broader second Trump administration rather than the president\u2019s specific remarks on Tuesday.",
      "The Kremlin will also have been pleased with Trump's comment that Ukrainians may be asking about the status of the country's next election.",
      "In doing so, the president echoed the criticisms of Vladimir Putin, who has ruled Russia for all but four of the past 25 years, but has repeatedly questioned the electoral legitimacy of Zelenskyy\u2019s continuing leadership.",
      "Ukraine last held a presidential election in 2019 and was due to have held one last April, but Zelenskyy has said in the past that it is not possible for Ukrainians to go to the polls in wartime and that view is also backed up by the country\u2019s constitution.",
      "According to a Pew Research Center poll released earlier this month, 47% of Americans approve of President Trump's job performance to some extent."

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 10:01:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Noah Lyles says his upcoming race with NFL star Tyreek Hill will help 'keep track relevant' outside of the Olympics.",
    "story": [
      "A little more than six months removed from winning an Olympic gold medal in the men\u2019s 100 meter and claiming the title of \"fastest man alive,\" American sprinter Noah Lyles is welcoming a new challenge this year: racing Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill.",
      "After trading barbs and trash talk for months, Lyles and Hill announced their intention to run against each other for real earlier this month. And Lyles is taking the opportunity seriously.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not here to play around,\u201d Lyles told NBC News. \u201cI\u2019m dead serious about this. I\u2019m going to bring everything I got for this.\u201d",
      "Lyles, 27, won gold in Paris with a thrilling finish in the 100 meter, defeating Jamaica\u2019s Kishane Thompson by a fraction of a second. Only eight days after the race, Hill \u2014 known as arguably the fastest receiver in the NFL \u2014 was asked on a podcast if he could beat Lyles in a race. He didn't hesitate to say yes.",
      "The two have exchanged shots since. Lyles escalated the beef when he held up a \"Tyreek could never\" sign after winning the 60-meter race at the New Balance Indoor Grand Prix on Feb 2.",
      "Lyles said he and Hill actually spoke to each other for the first time following the Indoor Grand Prix. In brief phone conversations, both athletes affirmed they were serious about facing off on the track and finally agreed to race.",
      "And in those conversations with Hill, Lyles says he made it clear not to mistake his trash talk for light heartedness.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want you to think that I\u2019m just out here joking,\u201d Lyles said of his message to the Dolphins receiver.\u00a0\u201cLet me be confident saying this. I\u2019m your guy. I\u2019m your guy who\u2019s gonna to let you swing, but best believe I will dodge and you will get hit with an uppercut.\u201d",
      "Hill, to his credit, isn\u2019t backing down from his decorated opponent, telling NBC Sports in February that Lyles \u201cshould be scared\u201d of him in a 40-yard dash.",
      "The event is not without its detractors, as some are calling it a \u201chuge mistake\u201d for a runner of Lyles\u2019s caliber to entertain Hill\u2019s challenge. But Lyles says a motivation is to bring more eyeballs to the sport outside of the Olympics, which only takes place once every four years.",
      "\u201cSomething that\u2019s constantly on my mind is how to keep track relevant,\u201d Lyles said. \u201cTrack and field has a great reputation inside of the Olympics, but in the marketing sense, when it comes to the U.S., it\u2019s just fallen short a few too many times.\u201d",
      "Lyles thinks his race against Hill could be a way to build enthusiasm for the sport.",
      "\u201cI get a lot of hate from people who don\u2019t believe that I should be racing him. And they\u2019re like, 'this is beneath you',\u201d he says. \u2018Well, apparently it\u2019s not, because here we are.\u201d",
      "As great of a runner Lyles is, he may be equally adept at drawing attention. He says he\u2019s been doing that dating back to the eighth grade, when he\u2019d try to draw \u201cooohs and aaahs\u201d from the crowd with antics before and after races.",
      "That streak of showmanship has followed Lyles to the Olympics and beyond. In June of last year, he brought Yu-Gi-Oh!\u00a0cards with him to the U.S. trials and even kept a rare one in his singlet. In Paris, Snoop Dogg wore a shirt with Lyles\u2019s face on it to one of his races.",
      "\u201cI want to be more than just a runner because there\u2019s enough runners,\" he said. \"But who\u2019s the performers?\u201d",
      "Most details of the race against Hill are still up in the air \u2014 most importantly length and location \u2014 though Lyles mentioned 60 meters and New York City's Times Square as possibilities. The summer is also likely for timing, as Lyles will be deep in training for U.S. championships and Hill will be gearing up for the NFL season.",
      "And as far as nerves go, Lyles says the only thing that could make him underperform is fans not getting excited enough.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m more thinking about, 'dang, I have an opportunity to break the world record along with beating Tyreek',\u201d Lyles said. \"So Tyreek better be ready, because if a world record gets dropped on his head, he ain\u2019t gonna be able to hear nothing.\u201d"

      "Valerie Bertinelli is getting candid about some recent struggles in her love life.",
      "The TV personality and actor shared a lengthy post on Instagram Feb. 17 in which she reflected on \u201cmistakes\u201d she has made in past relationships and the \u201cshame\u201d she has felt. She also offered advice to fans who are facing problems with their partners.",
      "Bertinelli, 64, uploaded a selfie on the social media platform and wrote in the caption, \u201cI think about mistakes I\u2019ve made in relationships a lot. I\u2019ve been on both sides of this and I think I finally have some perspective, so I thought I\u2019d share.\u201d",
      "She continued, \u201cWhen you feel hurt and wronged and know you deserve an apology but are being stonewalled by your partner because they\u2019re feeling shame, maybe this can shift your thinking.\u201d",
      "The former \u201cOne Day at a Time\u201d star then listed a few different scenarios and some questions fans should ask themselves when facing a challenging moment in their relationships.",
      "\u201cAre you only pointing out what they\u2019re doing wrong, being hypercritical, and expecting them to just fix it? That could be making things worse,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cChange, real change, never happens through criticism, shame, or pressure. They most likely already feel all that. (I know when I f\u2014 up, oof, do I feel shame).\u201d",
      "She cautioned fans to not shut down or get defensive in a heated moment and to instead focus on being empathetic and understanding.",
      "\u201cMaybe try, \u2018This is how I feel when this happens, can we figure this out together?\u2019\u201d she suggested. \u201cThat one small change can make a difference. Then you\u2019re on the same team. You\u2019re not working *against* each other, you\u2019re working *with* each other.\u201d",
      "Bertinelli acknowledged that being levelheaded in difficult conversations isn\u2019t easy, but she said it will possibly lead to a better outcome.",
      "\u201cI think we all just want to do better and feel awful when we\u2019ve hurt someone we love and shame prevents us from thinking clearly. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to relieve the one you love from shame so they can truly give you the amends you\u2019re looking for?\u201d she asked.",
      "At the end of her post, she poked fun at some of her past relationships.",
      "\u201cThen again, what do I know,\u201d she cheekily added. \u201cI have two failed marriages and fumbled the last true good man I met. Maybe don\u2019t take advice from me.\u201d",
      "Bertinelli was married to the late Eddie Van Halen from 1981 to 2007. She later tied the knot with financial planner Tom Vitale in 2011, but the two called it quits in 2022.",
      "Since then, the cookbook author has frequently opened up on social media about love and dating. Her last public relationship was with writer Mike Goodnough. \u00a0In March 2024, she told People that she was \u201cin love\u201d with someone but didn\u2019t disclose his name at the time. A few weeks later, Goodnough revealed himself as her mystery man on his Substack titled \u201cHoarse Whisperings.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am Valerie Bertinelli\u2019s boyfriend \u2026 and that may well be among the most surreal sentences I\u2019ve ever pecked out,\u201d he wrote at the time. \u201cBut it\u2019s true\u2026 and nothing about our actual relationship seems surreal. It just seems \u2026 good \u2026 lucky \u2026 a gift.\u201d",
      "In April 2024, they became Instagram official. She shared a sweet selfie of them wearing similar black glasses and quoted lyrics from Taylor Swift\u2019s song \u201cSo High School\u201d in the caption.",
      "They continued to share sweet interactions on social media over the next few months and she wished him a happy birthday in August 2024.",
      "But she later stopped posting about him. In November 2024, People reported via a source that Bertinelli and Goodnough had split."

    "story": [
      "The opening credits of the new season of \"The White Lotus\" left some fans aghast during the Feb. 16 premiere.",
      "The third season of the hit HBO show has a new song, \"Enlightenment,\" to accompany the opening credits, a strong shakeup from the beloved track \"Renaissance\" from Season 2.",
      "Though every theme song for \"The White Lotus\" \u2014 including Season 1's \"Aloha!\" \u2014 have been composed by the same person, Cristobal Tapia de Veer, fans are now divided on the song for Season 3, with many not loving the new track.",
      "The song is a departure from the first two seasons, mostly due to the fact that there are no vocals (though the accordion is also making waves).",
      "The echoing, haunting and sometimes outright confusing vocal intonations that have been a featured part of the songs for the first two seasons became part of the weekly viewing ritual.",
      "Though it's been days since the premiere of Season 3, watchers are still posting about the track on social media, sending some fans into a frenzy as they tried to work out how to dance \u2014 and not sing \u2014 to the song.",
      "\"Jail for whoever made the decision to change 'White Lotus' theme song,\" one person wrote on TikTok as the opening credits played on a TV. \"LOCK 'EM UP.\"",
      "An X user wrote, \"New White Lotus theme song doesn\u2019t hit the same should\u2019ve never changed it to begin with sorry to say.\"",
      "\u201cMy disappointment when I didn\u2019t hear this theme song,\u201d one TikToker said. \u201cOkay I was ready to dance... I don\u2019t like this new theme song.\u201d",
      "\"Trying to figure out how to dance to the new white lotus theme song,\" another TikToker wrote.",

      "\"First, Tanya. Now, this. Good Lord,\" another user wrote.",
      "\"Doodududoo wasn\u2019t just a melody. Doodududoo was THE character,\" another person wrote. \"Justice for Doodududoo!\"",
      "However, not all of the comments on the streamer's TikTok post of the opening credits were negative.",
      "\"this is honestly pretty dope,\" one person wrote. \"Love the new artwork too.\"",
      "\"I love this theme song though,\" one TikToker wrote.",
      "\"New theme is spellbinding!\" another wrote. \"Love something new!\"",
      "\"Tbh I love it the more I hear it,\" another commenter said, adding the heart-eyed emoji.",
      "\"This theme fits the show much better,\" someone else said. \"The first two were too upbeat, this one feels sinister toward the end, ominous too. So good.\"",
      "And at least one TikToker made their own video in defense of the new song.",
      "\"Unpopular belief but I personally love the new intro song for 'The White Lotus,'\" the TikToker said. \"For some reason this new intro song, and just the overall intro, is so mind blowing.\"",
      "Will more fans come around to the new track? Only time will tell, but composer Tapia de Veer was ready for a change. He said in a 2023 interview with Variety he initially thought his song for Season 2 was \"terrible.\"",
      "\u201cI took a little time to make an intro that would have those elements with things like a little harp, and some opera singing and some orchestral beats \u2026 and once I had that intro I started figuring out how to bring back the elements that are recognizable from the first season, which are the voices,\u201d he said.",
      "Tapia de Veer shared that for his first demo of the track, the original singer wasn't on the song. But he eventually added the distinctive yodeling in, along with more EDM beats, compared to the song for the first season.",
      "\u201cAll the elements start slowly changing into an electronic thing. I was just tripping, really, when I started making that beat. It really felt like being in a club and just celebrating with tons of people,\u201d he said.",
      "Tapia de Veer explained that he amped up the song's hype by increasing the energy every four beats.",
      "\u201cWhen the kick comes in and all of a sudden we\u2019re in a club, it just felt natural that these voices are so powerful, that every bar felt like I could go up one step and then another step,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next step it felt like we reached some kind of peak of energy and then you realize the next bar, you could still reach another one and then another one, so it keeps going.\u201d",
      "In an interview with Spotify in 2023, he shared a few details about his composing process for Season 3, which is set in Thailand.",
      "\u201cFor Thailand, I want to bring in some Eastern philosophy, something a little bit spiritual,\u201d he said. \u201cI love the Buddhist temples there, and funnily enough I have a collection of Thai gongs. I have 36 Thai gongs to make melodies with, so you can expect to hear some of those. I\u2019d really like to go deep with it, make it take a journey.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Civil rights icon Ruby Bridges says she may not have made it through her first year of integrating her all-white public elementary school in 1960, if not for a first grade teacher who became her \"best friend.\"",
      "Nearly 65 years later, that bond is as strong as ever between Bridges and retired teacher Barbara Henry.",
      "\"She\u2019s like another mom to me,\" Bridges said on TODAY on Feb. 18.",
      "The two forged a friendship as teacher and pupil under perilous circumstances at William Frantz Elementary School in New Orleans, and their bond is the subject of Bridges' new children's book. The activist and author is bringing her story to a new generation with \"Ruby Bridges: A Talk with My Teacher.\"",
      "Henry created a sanctuary for Bridges while white protesters outside the building railed against the school being desegregated. Bridges, who was 6 years old at the time, had to be walked into the building by federal marshals amid shouting and threats from white protesters.",
      "Many white families withdrew their children from the school due to her presence, while Bridges previously told TODAY.com that other white students were kept away from her by the school\u2019s principal.",
      "Bridges attended classes alone for a full year, with only Henry there to teach her.",
      "\"She filled my day with things to do,\" Bridges said on TODAY. \"She made school fun. I enjoyed learning. Even though the crowd was outside screaming and yelling, she would go to the window and close the window, and she\u2019s say \u2018Oh, we\u2019re going to have music today,\u2019 just to drown out everything.",
      "\u201cWe often say, both of us, she and I, that despite all the hate that was going on outside, inside that room it was filled with love.\u201d",
      "Henry, who is originally from Boston, would not be dissuaded at a time when many teachers at William Frantz Elementary School quit their jobs or refused to work while a Black child was part of the student body.",
      "\"I would not have gotten through that if it had not been for my teacher,\" Bridges said. \"And as you know, teachers really quit their jobs back then because they didn't want to teach Black kids. This one teacher came from Boston to teach me. She was amazing.\"",
      "Bridges said she was not allowed to go out for recess or eat her lunch in the school cafeteria, which led to her hiding her lunch in Henry's classroom.",
      "\"Like any 6-year-old, you want friends,\" Bridges said. \"And I remembered what kindergarten was like, that all of the kids met in the cafeteria, so I thought I\u2019m never going to make friends if I don\u2019t get to the cafeteria.",
      "\"That prompted me to hide my sandwiches, until the mice got really bad. And she found the sandwiches, and I was in a world of trouble.\"",
      "Bridges, 70, realized how important the bond was with Henry when she matriculated to the second grade in the 1961-62 school year.",
      "\"I have to say that second grade was much worse for me than first because she was my best friend,\" Bridges said. \"I didn't have any friends, and I had gotten so close to her.",
      "\"And I was so excited about going back for second grade, telling her what my summer was like, happy to see her again, and she was gone.\"",
      "More than six decades later, Henry's kindness still resonates with Bridges.",
      "\"I think that each and every one of us, we probably remember one teacher that made an impact in our lives, and she was the one for me,\" she said.",
      "Bridges' story of integration was one of many from the civil rights era, but it has particularly endured. The scene of a tiny first grader being escorted to school by federal marshals also lives on in the form of the iconic Norman Rockwell painting, \"The Problem We All Live With.\"",
      "\"It's that one lone child,\" Bridges said. \"That innocence that we all see when we see that painting. How could that have happened to a 6-year-old? Innocence. And I think that affects each and every one of us when we see it, still to this very day.\"",
      "She also believes the moment can continue to deliver a strong message to the children of today.",
      "\"And for kids, I think that they resonate with it,\" she said. \"Every kid remembers someone not wanting to play with them, not giving them a chance. And I think that resonates with them.\""

      "He\u2019s frequently her plus-one",
      "When Wilson opened up about Hodges to Billboard, she mentioned that he \u201ccan\u2019t sing a lick.\u201d But even though he\u2019s no country crooner, he\u2019s found himself at several music-award ceremonies.",
      "Since going public with their relationship, Hodges has become a fixture at many of country music\u2019s biggest events as Wilson\u2019s date."

    "published": "Sat, 15 Feb 2025 00:24:40 GMT",
    "summary": "What is performing or writing for \"Saturday Night Live\" really like? TODAY.com talked to past and present cast to learn what really goes on behind the scenes.",
    "story": [
      "Shortly before \"NBC's Saturday Night\" lit up American TV sets on Oct. 11, 1975, producer Lorne Michaels and seven unknown actors and comedians appeared on \"The Tomorrow Show,\" a late-night talk show with Tom Snyder, to promote their new 90-minute variety series.",
      "\"We've got eight and we're hoping for two for it to really work,\" Michaels deadpanned to Snyder about his new cast. \"So, not all of these people will become stars.\"",
      "Sitting next to him? Chevy Chase, Dan Aykroyd, Jane Curtin, Garrett Morris, Gilda Radner, John Belushi and Laraine Newman. Despite Michaels' tongue-in-cheek prediction, they would, in fact, go on to become not only stars, but legends as the original Not Ready For Prime Time Players on the soon-to-be renamed \"Saturday Night Live.\"",
      "Now, 50 years later, the sketch comedy show has gone on to become the most Emmy-decorated television show in history, receiving countless nominations, awards and accolades. And in 2017, those original cast members were inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame.",
      "Defined by its satirical and often censor-defying comedy, along with performances by cutting-edge musicians and artists, \"SNL\" has been a touchstone of American pop culture for five decades. In that time, more than 160 cast members have come and gone, many of them going on to become legends in their own right.",
      "In honor of \"SNL's\" golden anniversary, TODAY.com sat down with past and present cast members to learn what really goes on behind the scenes of the late night show \u2014\u00a0from the anxiety to the exhilaration \u2014 what viewers at home might be surprised to find out, along with their take on the best character breaks and sketches that didn't go quite as planned.",
      "Here's what they revealed.",
      "Answers have been edited for length and clarity.",
      "Laraine Newman (1975 to 1980)",
      "You can only be aware of the audience that's in the studio. There's no sense, at least from my experience, that there's millions of people watching.",
      "It's like everything I was trained to do at The Groundlings where we did sketches and were in place, in costume, doing the sketch, lights out, run off, change, get back down to your spot, lights up and do the next sketch. That's exactly what \"SNL\" is.",
      "What's heroic is that the set designers, they have four days to build sets for sketches that might not even make it to air. The craft of the look of the show, the work that goes into that, the thought that goes into it. The fact that the writers get to collaborate with every aspect \u2014 wardrobe, makeup, everything \u2014 to really optimize their material. I don't think there's any show like that.",
      "Lorne (Michaels) did not want us to laugh, and I never got close to laughing, except when Rodney Dangerfield hosted. We were doing a takeoff on the Woody Allen movie \"Manhattan\" called \"Manhasset.\" (Dangerfield) is saying, \"Tracy, don't go to Manhasset. I tell ya, it's rough. I got a waterbed and there was a guy at the bottom of it.\"",
      "Now, I'd heard that joke in read-through and the rehearsal and it still got me. If you watch it, you can't tell. But I am dying. It is everything I could do not to laugh.",
      "Nora Dunn (1985 to 1990)",
      "There's something about the camera coming on \u2014 you come to life. Because right before that, you're not. It's like your dead, and you're revived and it's a \"do-or-die\" situation. And you go, \"Well, I got here.\" I always tell myself, \"You got here. There's a reason that you are here.\"",
      "I don't think you do it. I think the other side does it. The lights do it. They go, \"5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ... boom!\" It just happens. You can't plan it.",
      "When you're watching a sketch, right behind that wall, someone's taking their clothes off and putting on a costume and having a wig grabbed off their head and put something else on it. You have to make those quick changes.",
      "You might be on with a guest star, the host, and you're like, \"Gotta get my clothes off!\" You're not naked, but next to naked. Every time there's a sketch on \"Saturday Night Live,\" there's all kinds of stuff going on in the background.",
      "We were not supposed to use cue cards, but we all did. But Lorne was like (imitating Michaels), \"They're there if you need them. That's why they're not there, because you don't know your lines.\"",
      "So, Jon (Lovitz) and I had to do a sketch with Charlton Heston. He needed glasses, but he said he didn't. He didn't wear glasses, so they had to make his cue cards huge. So, we had huge stacks of cue cards and we were doing an Egyptian scene. We're dressed up as a couple that's having pyramids built, and the cue card guy lost control of the cards. They spread all over the floor. Lorne was standing 15 feet away and he was furious. We just beelined away from Lorne because he was going to say (imitating Michaels), \"Well, someone didn't learn their lines.\" He was not happy with us.",
      "Kevin Nealon (1986 to 1995)",
      "It's unlike anything I've ever experienced before. It's like sitting in a rollercoaster car, right at the beginning, just anticipating and waiting for it all to happen. And it was a rollercoaster, there were ups and downs, it was crazy.",
      "I remember before I did my first sketch, it was \"Mr. Subliminal,\" and right before, Lorne Michaels comes up to me, puts his hand on my shoulder, and he said, \"Are you sure this is what you want?\" It was funny and it relaxed me a little bit.",
      "But I remember the excitement of the first show. I think The Pretenders were on, and I remember finishing a sketch, then running back to get made up and I'm hearing the band playing and I'm thinking, \"Oh my God,\" and I got filled with such energy and excitement that, \"This is it, man, this is live, this is 'Saturday Night Live.'\"",
      "I think the audience doesn't realize how small the studio is when they get there. And I don't think they realize that we're scrambling to figure out what sketches to cut from rehearsal, how to improve a sketch and what didn't work and what you're surprised that did work.",
      "But, also, I think a lot of times they don't realize how frightened we are about going out there.",
      "(Breaking character) was very rare for me and for a lot of people on our cast because, at the time, Lorne thought of that as being very \"hacky.\" Also, it was a disservice to the writer. If you put all this labor into writing a sketch and then people are breaking on it, it's like, \"Well, there goes that sketch.\"",
      "I did break with Chevy Chase on \"Weekend Update\" once, but that was one of the only times I ever broke in nine years.",
      "Molly Shannon (1995 to 2001)",
      "It's exhilaration. When I hosted, for example, right before you go on, you're in the back and you're with a stage manager and they're like, \"OK ... 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ...\" So, you're like, \"Ugh (clutches her stomach).\"",
      "I got advice when I hosted. Steve Higgins, a wonderful producer on the show was like, \"Take your time. You don't have to run out there. It's OK.\" So, I thought that was good advice. Set yourself on stage, take a deep breath. But, definitely, there's nerves. I would say, an excited, kind of nervous feeling.",
      "I remember years ago, when I did the show, we would all have dinner after the rehearsals, before the live show. And I remember, because we had the whole week of writing comedy sketches, rehearsing them at dinner, I felt like, \"Ugh, this is time to just relax before the big comedy show live at 11:30 p.m.\"",
      "But people would still be doing comedy bits at dinner, and I remember thinking I just wanted to talk seriously and not have anybody joke around, like, have a quiet dinner before we have to go do a show. I was like, \"No comedy bits at dinner, like, please, let's just eat.\"",
      "Will Ferrell and I were characters who had recently lost 100 pounds, and we were very excited about it. We did it center stage and Will Ferrell and I always had a deal that, if you bombed, if you were tanking, and people weren't laughing, you would still have to commit as an actor, pour your heart into it even more.",
      "While we're performing it, there were crickets, no laughter at all. I remember during the scene, looking at Will, we were like (grimace), but we just kept performing it like the greatest dramatic actors, and we thought it was so funny. So, it entertained us that you had to bomb with grace and dignity, to just jump into bombing and be OK with it. Scoring and bombing were on equal planes \u2014 you had to respect both.",
      "Cheri Oteri (1995 to 2000)",
      "I would always be in the bathroom. That's how fearful I was. I was always very nervous. It's sheer fear and excitement. But because you only get a chance to do it once, it's more fear for me. But I've always been like that, even when I did theater. I was always in the bathroom until it was like, \"10, 9, 8 ...\"",
      "We have a two-hour draft show at 8 o'clock, then a half hour is cut out of that and you're just ... nothing's ever settled until 11:30 p.m. You're working to get your sketches in during the week and you don't know if they're going to get in. And if they do get in, they could always be cut between dress and air.",
      "Nothing is guaranteed. So that's kind of hard. I always say it's a show that you audition for every week, that you already got.",
      "There was one time I broke and it was doing \"Morning Latte.\" It was with Jerry Seinfeld. In this sketch, Will (Ferrell) goes like this (makes hitting motion) with a book and it hits me in the head. That book hit me so hard in the head \u2014 but it didn't hurt. It just clocked. And because of the book being a hardcover, the sound just reverberated and the audience went, \"Ooohhh.\"",
      "I went back and I saw stars. I started laughing and I couldn't stop. Will had to say my lines. Tears are coming down, I'm laughing so much. I've never not been able to recover from something. But because I saw stars, I couldn't stop laughing.",
      "But it was dress, so on air, I knew it was coming. But that was the one and only time I broke.",
      "Ana Gasteyer (1996 to 2002)",
      "Those last 15 seconds right before you go live, I think it's largely fear. It's not fear, necessarily, about failing or anything like that, but it's all so last-minute that it's just your brain synthesizing what has inevitably changed in your sketch moments before you've started and the breakneck pace of it because it really is live.",
      "What people don't understand \u2014\u00a0it's live, and it's written that week, that minute, that day. We may have written a sketch on Tuesday night, but it got rewritten on Thursday. It got rewritten again on Friday and then rewritten before your dress.",
      "You may have just come off another experience, may have had a failed quick change or stressed moment because commercial breaks are only two minutes. They might feel long when you're at home, but two minutes is really, really, really fast to have to change an entire outfit and wig. So, what's happening in those 15 seconds is kind of rooting yourself in the space of what you're going to do.",
      "You know, when you're coming back from a commercial and you're at home and you're like, \"Gosh, why is this taking so long? Why am I looking at this picture of Ariana Grande for so incredibly long?\"",
      "That's because, wildly, some set has not been assembled. That's what those bumper (photo) cards are for, to buy a little bit of time on the edges of your returns.",
      "There was a sketch we did, a Sally Jessy Raphael with Christina Ricci. She had never done live television before, so she was really spooked and kind of addled, and maybe had a little champagne. There was a bad teen sketch and I was Sally Jessy, there was a fist fight.",
      "It looked bad at dress. Lorne, in the notes, between dress and air, was like, \u201cLet\u2019s work on that punch.\u201d We didn\u2019t have a fight coordinator, it was very unrehearsed and the depth perception was off. We got to air and (Christina) was so focused, and that fist hit my nose in such a dramatic, hilarious, painful ... I mean, in the moment I remember my Sally Jessy red signature frames went flying up off my face and landed in, like, slow motion. It was insane. It was like a full-face TKO. I remember just being like, \u201cI\u2019ve got to maintain the impression,\u201d because I was so nervous about my Sally Jessy impression the whole time.",
      "Rachel Dratch (1999 to 2006)",
      "It's kind of a mix. Definite excitement, nerves ... fear is a factor. Doing theater before \"SNL,\" the fear is kind of what drives you. So, the fear is good actually. But, overall, excitement.",
      "This is kind of common sense, but you don't think of it when you're watching at home: That in between when you're watching a commercial, all the madness is happening because it's live. Someone's changing costume, hair, someone can go from being a baby to an old man in that commercial. There's a team of people working \u2014\u00a0every person has their own hair, makeup and wardrobe person. So, there's this huge transformation taking place or the sets are being moved.",
      "A sketch that went wrong in the best way possible was the \"Debbie Downer at Disney World,\" where we started laughing. That's the one everyone seems to remember so well. People tell me they watch when they're sad to cheer them up and that makes me so happy.",
      "But, yes, of course, we try not to laugh on the show. But that one, knowing the camera was coming in every time after I was saying this total bummer fact, and trying to keep it together, it just shows that this show is live. If there's any doubt, things can go wrong. And sometimes it's very funny when they do.",
      "Amy Poehler (2001 to 2008)",
      "Performing on \"SNL\" feels like working in a comedy emergency room. So you are rushing around sometimes, sometimes things are slow. You are around trained professionals, you have high stakes and it feels often very life or death.",
      "There's so many surprising things about \"SNL\" that people wouldn't realize. It's such a unique unicorn of a show and the way it's put together. I think a lot of people don't realize how tired everyone is all the time, especially during read through, because people have stayed up all night and then go in and have to perform.",
      "I think people also don't realize how most of your time at \"SNL\" is wondering when your food is going to get there. That's about 75% of your brain space, \"When is my food going to come?\" So, I think a lot of people are thinking that when (viewers) are thinking that they're thinking about sketches.",
      "My first year on \"SNL,\" the great John Goodman hosted and was so nice to me, even though I was a lone freshman. I remember I did a sketch with Chris Kattan and I got flipped into a dumpster \u2014 on purpose. I think I kind of passed out for a second and then woke up and I remember thinking, \"I wonder if anyone's ever passed out on 'SNL'?'\" Then I thought, \"How long have I been in this dumpster?\" So, that was fun. That was a good entry into what was a wild ride.",
      "Mikey Day (2013 to Present)",
      "It's so week-to-week. That's how the show works. You could have a week when you're in everything, you could have a week where you have three lines and one thing. It all depends. So, I feel like the emotions vary depending on that week.",
      "However, one constant is that after, \"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night,\" and the band starts playing \u2014 that's when the adrenaline (starts) and I'm always reminded, \"Oh wow, it's 'SNL,'\" and I always get kind of a little high off that.",
      "There's so many heroes on that show. The crew, itself, is, like, Tetris because Studio 8H isn't that big. So, they're constantly moving and all the equipment feels like it's from the '70s. This stuff has that old-school feel in terms of its size and bulk, and moving it to and fro on Saturday is pretty crazy. But they make it work somehow.",
      "Also, the filmed pieces, they build those sets in a day \u2014 a literal day \u2014 and sometimes there's three films being shot in one week, which is wild.",
      "Most recently, it was \"Beavis and Butt-Head\" with Ryan Gosling. It was a lot of fun. Heidi (Gardner) broke, Ryan and I were laughing, giggling like two schoolboys.",
      "But I remember the first time I laughed and it was in an unpredictable sketch called \"Dog Head Man.\" It's like geneticists who have created Dog Head Man. It was so dumb. At dress they were feeding the dog some treat or something and the dog didn't really like it. We're like, \"Can we just give it bread?\" And then it just went to town on this bread and I started laughing because Sam Rockwell and I were talking about such heavy stuff, and you just see the dog is so happy, going to town on human food.",
      "Dog Head Man stands out as one that I remember as the first time I kind of lost it. It wasn't too bad, but when you start to go, you're like, \"Oh no, I haven't done this before, am I going to get in trouble?\"",
      "Heidi Gardner (2017 to present)",
      "It's all of those things, actually. But I always just remind myself to have fun, take a few deep breaths. I'm going to do my job, the words are going to come out. That's always the biggest fear: Am I just going to stop knowing how to read cue cards? But it happens.",
      "I had never seen the show as a fan \u2014 I was a fan, but I had never gone to it. I really didn't understand that it was all in the same studio. I thought \"Weekend Update\" was in a separate room, that you walked down the hall to \"Weekend Update,\" then you walk to a sketch, but it's all in the studio. So, those two-minute commercial breaks really are like just complete chaos. The most organized chaos in the world. And it's really its own art form to watch the crew navigate that.",
      "Well, obviously, \"Beavis and Butt-Head,\" but there was one last season I did with Kristen Wiig, where we were \"Mad Men\" type secretaries, and she was supposed to fall through a desk, like sit on a desk and it breaks away. And I was supposed to fall through a wall and both of us just didn't quite have the strength to break either one.",
      "So, she sat on the desk and it didn't break and then she had to hop down. I went into the wall and it didn't break. So it was very funny to try and navigate that live.",
      "Chloe Fineman (2019 to Present)",
      "Performing on \"SNL\" is truly a fever dream. After so many shows, I'm like, \"Wait, what? I was with who? And I kissed so and so?\" Or, \"I was on stage with Ariana Grande?\" It really runs the gamut. It's very surreal, I'd say.",
      "I think viewers at home would be surprised to learn about the machine that happens during the live show. Anytime I've had friends and family come, it's amazing to watch. The sets are running over here and we're running here and there's heels and this thing's getting taken apart and put together. It happens like clockwork and, really, so much can go wrong. For some reason, it doesn't and it's magic. To me, that's almost as entertaining as the show.",
      "We did a \"Cast Away\" sketch with Jason Momoa, and he was supposed to lift me up and we were supposed to pretend to, like, have our bodies move, but he's so much bigger than me and I'm so short and little, that I really was like, \"Woo!\" He really thrusted me in a way that took my breath away. Honestly, that's a favorite."

      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hit back at Donald Trump's accusation overnight that Ukraine started its war with Russia, saying that the American president is trapped in a \u201cdisinformation bubble\u201d and adding that his country was not for sale.",
      "The pugnacious response followed Trump\u2019s surprising comments Tuesday that Ukraine was responsible for Russia\u2019s invasion of the country three years ago. Trump also argued that Kyiv could have made a deal to avoid the conflict.",
      "The president added that his Ukrainian counterpart's approval ratings sat at 4% in Ukraine \u2014 despite an opinion poll released Wednesday by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology showing that 57% of Ukrainians trust Zelenskyy.",
      "\u201cAs we are talking about 4%, we have seen this disinformation, we understand it\u2019s coming from Russia,\u201d Zelenskyy told a news conference in Kyiv Wednesday, as he dismissed Trump\u2019s claim.",
      "He added that any attempts to replace him during the war would fail \u2014 Trump raised the question of Ukrainian elections following Russian President Vladimir Putin's repeated assertions that Zelenskyy is not Ukraine's legitimate leader \u2014 contending that the overwhelming majority of Ukrainians would not support concessions to Russia.",
      "\u201cThe army is quite resilient, and it is the most resilient in Europe ... and it guarantees us the opportunity to speak with dignity and on an equal footing with other partners \u2014 allies or non-allies,\u201d Zelenskyy said.",
      "Referring to U.S. support given to Ukraine so far \u2014 $67 billion in weapons and $31.5 billion in budgetary support \u2014 Zelenskyy said that American demands that Ukraine should hand over $500 billion in minerals was \u201cnot a serious conversation\u201d and added that he cannot sell his country.",
      "Zelenskyy's statements came the day after President Trump responded to remarks the Ukrainian leader had made earlier about not wanting \u201canyone making decisions behind our backs.\u201d",
      "Speaking to reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort late Tuesday, Trump said he believed he had the power to end the war in Ukraine, \"but today I heard, \u2018Oh, well, we weren\u2019t invited.\u2019 Well, you\u2019ve been there for three years.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou should have never started it,\" he added. \"You could have made a deal.\u201d",
      "The reaction in Moscow to the broader change in direction of U.S. foreign policy has been more upbeat. Speaking to Russian lawmakers on Wednesday, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov did not directly address Trump's comments but he suggested the Kremlin was pleased with talks so far.",
      "The U.S. president is, \u201cthe first, and so far, apparently, the only Western leader who has publicly and loudly said that one of the root causes of the Ukrainian situation was the brazen path of the previous administration to draw Ukraine into NATO,\u201d Lavrov said. \u201cNo Western leader has ever said this,\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is already a signal that he understands our position,\u201d Lavrov added, in a speech that covered the broader second Trump administration rather than the president\u2019s specific remarks on Tuesday.",
      "The Kremlin will also have been pleased with Trump's comment that Ukrainians may be asking about the status of the country's next election.",
      "In doing so, the president echoed the criticisms of Vladimir Putin, who has ruled Russia for all but four of the past 25 years, but has repeatedly questioned the electoral legitimacy of Zelenskyy\u2019s continuing leadership.",
      "Ukraine last held a presidential election in 2019 and was due to have held one last April, but Zelenskyy has said in the past that it is not possible for Ukrainians to go to the polls in wartime and that view is also backed up by the country\u2019s constitution.",
      "According to a Pew Research Center poll released earlier this month, 47% of Americans approve of President Trump's job performance to some extent."

    "story": [
      "Israel's security Cabinet was set to meet Monday to discuss the second phase of the government's ceasefire deal with Hamas, even as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu voiced his support for President Donald Trump's plan to take over the Gaza Strip.",
      "Following a call with Trump's special envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, Netanyahu instructed Israel's negotiating team to depart for the Egyptian capital of Cairo on Monday to discuss the \"continuation of the implementation\" of the first stage of the deal that has brought a pause to deadly fighting in Gaza, the Israeli leader's office said in a statement Sunday.",
      "Netanyahu's office said the negotiating team would receive \"instructions for the continuation of negotiations on Phase B issues\" after the Israeli security Cabinet's discussion on the matter as it pushed back on reports suggesting Israel had dispatched the negotiating team under U.S. pressure.",
      "Branding those reports \"fake news,\" Netanyahu's office said in a statement there had been \"no American pressure to send a delegation to negotiate Phase 2.\"",
      "Still, plans for further negotiations come after Netanyahu said Sunday following a visit from Secretary of State Marco Rubio that Israel and the Trump administration had formed a \"joint strategy\" to ensure that the \"gates of hell will open\" if Hamas does not eventually release all of the hostages who remain held captive in Gaza \u2014 a key requirement of the current ceasefire deal.",
      "He also said Israel was \"committed\" to Trump's widely condemned plan to take over Gaza, where tens of thousands of people have been killed and much of the infrastructure destroyed during Israel's offensive in the enclave.",
      "That campaign began after around 1,200 people were killed in the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, terror attacks, with 251 people taken hostage into Gaza in an assault that marked a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "Since then, more than 48,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to local health officials, though researchers estimate the death toll could be significantly higher. At least 60% of the territory\u2019s infrastructure, including schools and hospitals, has been destroyed, according to estimates from the United Nations.",
      "Hailing Trump's proposal to take over Gaza as a \"revolutionary vision,\" Netanyahu said the U.S. and Israel had also come up with a \"joint strategy\" to see it through and bring about a \"completely different Gaza.\"",
      "In a meeting Sunday with a U.S. Senate delegation led by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz further said he believed Trump's plan for Gaza was \"the only one that can guarantee security for the residents of the south and the state of Israel, in light of the lessons learned from the events of Oct. 7.\"",
      "Hamas on Sunday accused Netanyahu of looking to \u201creturn to aggression\u201d in Gaza as it accused Israel of \u201chesitation in starting the second phase of negotiations.\u201d",
      "The militant group also accused Israeli forces of carrying out a bombing east of Rafah city in southern Gaza, which it said killed three police officers. Video captured by NBC News\u2019 crew on the ground in Gaza on Sunday appeared to show people mourning over their bodies after they were taken to the European Hospital in Khan Younis.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said in a statement that troops had \u201coperated to distance several suspects who approached them\u201d and were perceived as posing a threat.",
      "It added that forces on Sunday had fired to distance \u201csuspicious vehicles\u201d that were advancing north from central Gaza along a route unauthorized for passage under the ceasefire agreement and that the trucks had not been inspected, which it said violated the terms of the truce.",
      "That came as concerns grew over the expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.",
      "Anti-settlement watchdog group Peace Now said in a news release Sunday that Israel had issued a tender for the construction of nearly 1,000 additional settler housing units that could significantly expand the population of the Efrat settlement in the territory.",
      "The organization warned that such a development would also risk further blocking the development of the nearby Palestinian city of Bethlehem.",
      "Israel has occupied the West Bank since the 1967 Middle East war, building and expanding Jewish settlements there that are widely considered illegal by the international community, a charge Israel rejects.",
      "The West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem would form the internationally recognized future state Palestinians seek \u2014 and the expansion of settlements, as well as Trump's plan to take over Gaza, presents major obstacles to that effort.",
      "CORRECTION (Feb. 17, 2025, 11:55 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated when Peace Now issued its news release. It was Sunday, not Monday."

      "The advance on Butembo means the rebels are spanning out both north and south of Goma. The rebels this week seized another provincial capital to Goma\u2019s south, Bukavu, near Burundi. The region is rich in gold and coltan, a key mineral for the production of capacitors used in most consumer electronics such as laptops and smartphones.",

      "Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet alleges that Bolsonaro and 33 others participated in a plan to remain in power. The alleged plot, he wrote, included a plan to poison Lula and shoot dead Supreme Court Justice\u00a0Alexandre de Moraes, a foe of the former president.",
      "\u201cThe members of the criminal organization structured a plan at the presidential palace to attack institutions, aiming to bring down the system of the powers and the democratic order, which received the sinister name of \u2018Green and Yellow Dagger,\u2019\u201d Gonet wrote in a 272-page indictment. \u201cThe plan was conceived and taken to the knowledge of the president, and he agreed to it.\u201d",
      "Bolsonaro is often seen in Brazil\u2019s yellow-and-green national soccer jersey and the colors have become associated with his political movement",
      "In November, Brazil\u2019s Federal Police filed an 884-page report with Gonet detailing the scheme. They allege a systematic effort to sow distrust in the electoral system, drafting a decree to provide legal cover for the plot, pressuring top military brass to go along with the plan and\u00a0inciting a riot in the capital.",
      "In the indictment, Gonet described the alleged crimes as part of a chain of events articulated with an overarching objective of stopping Bolsonaro from leaving office, \u201ccontrary to the result of the popular will at the polls.\u201d",
      "The Supreme Court will analyze the charges and, if accepted, Bolsonaro will stand trial.",
      "The far-right leader denies wrongdoing. \u201cI have no concerns about the accusations, zero,\u201d Bolsonaro told journalists earlier on Tuesday during a visit to the Senate in Brasilia.",

      "Gonet said the criminal organization he charged \u201chad as leaders the [then] president himself and his running mate, Gen. Braga Netto.\u201d",

      "The charges are \u201chistoric,\u201d said Luis Henrique Machado, a criminal attorney and professor at the IDP university in Brasilia, adding that he expects the Supreme Court to accept the charges and put Bolsonaro on trial sometime before the end of next year.",
      "\u201cThe charges show Brazil\u2019s institutions are robust, independent and agile,\u201d Machado said. \u201cThey are a role model for other countries where democracy is at risk.\u201d",

      "Following Tuesday\u2019s charges, Bolsonaro will \u201cposition himself as a victim,\u201d said Carlos Melo, a political science professor at Insper University in Sao Paulo. Bolsonaro has previously said his legal woes are an attempt to stop him from returning to office.",
      "\u201cThere are polls saying he would be competitive in the 2026 elections against Lula, one of them published today,\u201d said Melo. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be political dust, but it will settle.\u201d"

      "Conditions were clear following days of extreme snowfall at Toronto Pearson International Airport when a Delta plane carrying 80 people flipped upside down in a fiery crash-landing, officials said, prompting questions about what caused the plane to overturn on the runway in another nightmare scenario for air travelers.",
      "In the days leading up to the incident, two storms dropped more than 20 inches of snow at the airport, which is more snow accumulation than the airport saw all of last winter, Toronto Pearson President and CEO Deborah Flint said at a news conference Tuesday.",
      "\u201cMonday was a clear day, though,\u201d Flint said, adding that it was an \u201coperational recovery day\u201d for the airport after the pair of storms canceled nearly 800 scheduled flights.",
      "Yet, when Delta Flight 4819 came in for a landing from Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport around 2:15 p.m. Monday, it burst into flames upon landing and turned upside down on the tarmac, leaving 76 passengers and four crew members dangling from their seat belts, according to witnesses and a video posted on social media.",
      "\u201cAll of a sudden, I just remember being fully sideways,\u201d passenger Pete Koukov said on the \u201cTODAY\u201d show Tuesday morning. \u201cI was looking down and just seeing like sparks and flames and whatever was grinding against the ground. It happened pretty dang quick and we were just upside down, hanging from our seat belts.\u201d",
      "There were no deaths, and none of the 21 people treated at local hospitals had life-threatening injuries, Flint said. Nineteen of them have since been released, she said.",
      "Another official at the news conference said the injuries were mostly back sprains, anxiety, head injuries and headaches, as well as nausea and vomiting due to fuel exposure.",
      "Flint said the cause of the crash is being investigated by the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, as she urged against speculation and declined to answer questions about the conditions of the runway.",
      "On Monday, Todd Aitken, fire chief with the Greater Toronto Airports Authority, told reporters that the runway was dry and that there were no crosswind conditions. At the Tuesday news conference, Aitken directed questions about the investigation to the TSB.",
      "The incident comes after two back-to-back deadly aircraft crashes in the U.S. sparked concerns about flying.",
      "Seven people were killed in Philadelphia on Jan. 31 after an air ambulance careened out of the sky and crashed near a mall.",
      "Two days before that, an Army helicopter and a commercial airplane collided midair near Washington, D.C., killing all 67 passengers in both aircraft, in the deadliest U.S. air crash in almost a quarter century.",
      "There is still no official cause for either crash, though the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating both cases, said Friday that it had more work to do regarding the Washington, D.C., crash."
