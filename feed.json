      "Kamala Harris shares her candid reflections in her new book, \"107 Days,\" about her 2024 presidential campaign against Donald Trump",
      "WASHINGTON -- When it was all over, Kamala Harris couldn't believe it. \u201cI could barely breathe,\u201d she writes in her new book about learning she had lost the 2024 presidential election to Donald Trump.",
      "One of her aides peeled \u201cMadame President\u201d off celebratory cupcakes before serving them to crushed staffers. Harris kept asking, \u201cMy God, my God, what will happen to our country?\"",
      "The next morning was no easier. \u201cI was ashamed to realize I was in the denial and bargaining stages of grief, a very long way from acceptance,\u201d she wrote.",
      "It's one of several raw admissions in Harris' book, \u201c107 Days,\u201d that is scheduled for release Tuesday. The title refers to the length of the hyperspeed campaign that the former vice president launched against Trump after Joe Biden dropped out of the race.",
      "Although Harris earned a reputation as guarded and circumspect, the book has the tone of someone who is finished biting her tongue. She concedes mistakes, reveals frustrations and details some of the stranger moments from her race.",
      "The book isn't a winding memoir or a political treatise, and Harris doesn't disclose any future plans. Instead, it reads like a ticking time bomb, with each chapter counting down to Election Day.",
      "Here's some memorable moments.",
      "Harris insists in the book that she had no concerns about Biden's ability to serve as president. \u201cIf I believed that, I would have said so.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut at eighty-one, Joe got tired,\" Harris wrote. \"That's when his age showed in physical and verbal stumbles.\u201d",
      "Harris wrote that Biden's inner circle \u201cshould have realized that any campaign was a bridge too far.\" However, \u201cit seemed that the worse things got, the more they pushed him.\u201d",
      "The tenuous situation unraveled when Biden and Trump faced off with each other. \u201cAs soon as he walked onto the debate stage in Atlanta, I could see he wasn't right,\" Harris wrote.",
      "Biden's team appeared to be in denial. Afterward, they gave Harris talking points that said \u201cJOE BIDEN WON.\"",
      "Harris wrote warmly of her partnership with Biden, but there were frosty moments too. As Biden faced calls to drop out of the race, he invited Harris to join him for a Fourth of July celebration at the White House.",
      "First lady Jill Biden pulled Harris' husband Doug Emhoff aside. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked. \u201cAre you supporting us?\u201d",
      "Later, in private, Emhoff erupted in anger. \u201cThey have to ask if we\u2019re loyal?\u201d",
      "Another difficult episode came after Harris had replaced Biden at the top of the ticket and was preparing for her own debate with Trump.",
      "Shortly before she took the stage, Biden called to say he heard from his brother that Harris had been badmouthing him, upsetting some power brokers in Philadelphia. Then he rambled about his own debate performances while Harris was \u201cbarely listening.\u201d",
      "\u201cI just couldn't understand why he would call me, right now, and make it all about himself,\" she wrote.",

While Harris was serving as vice president, West put together what was known as the \u201cRed File,\u201d a collection of plans in case something happened to Biden.",

      "He kept refreshing the document as people pressured Biden to drop out, which came in handy when Biden finally pulled the plug on his reelection campaign.",

      "\u201cIf you want to put me in the strongest position, you have to endorse me now,\" she recalled telling him. Harris prevailed, and the endorsement happened shortly after Biden announced that he was done.",
      "Campaigns can be hallucinatory affairs, and this one was full of bizarre moments.",
      "Harris writes that she warmed up for her convention speech with a professional voice coach who \u201cwanted me to stand there and emit animal noises.\u201d A little hesitant, Harris got her entire team to make \u201chums, grunts and trills\" with her.",
      "Harris also writes about talking with Trump after a second assassination attempt against him. Despite tearing into her on the campaign trail, Trump proceeded to flatter his opponent.",
      "\u201cHow do I say bad things about you now?\u201d he said. \u201cI'm going to tone it down. I will. You're going to see.\u201d Then Trump said that his daughter Ivanka \u201cis your big fan.\u201d",

      "Kahlo vibrantly and unsparingly depicted herself and events from her life, which was upended by a bus accident at 18. She started to paint while bedridden, underwent a series of painful surgeries on her damaged spine and pelvis, then wore casts until her death in 1954 at age 47.",
      "Painted in 1940, \u201cEl sue\u00f1o (La cama)\u201d shows the artist, wreathed in vines, lying in a four-poster bed floating in a pale blue sky. A skeleton wired with dynamite and clutching a bouquet of flowers lies atop the canopy.",
      "The image is exploding with symbolism and feels like an allegory \u2013 but the artist really did have a skeleton on top of her bed.",

    "story": [
      "Robert Redford, who died Tuesday at 89, transformed the film industry with the Sundance Institute and Film Festival",
      "Robert Redford was disillusioned with the Hollywood mainstream. The Sundance Kid, who died Tuesday at age 89, knew that there were more stories out there, ones that weren\u2019t getting made into films because of the rigidity of the business. So he made something different, founding Sundance Institute and the Sundance Film Festival as an alternative avenue for emerging filmmakers, where independence was a virtue, not a liability.",
      "Over the past four decades, the institute and the festival have given an early platform to countless young filmmakers, including Steven Soderbergh, Paul Thomas Anderson, Quentin Tarantino, Ryan Coogler, Chlo\u00e9 Zhao, Nicole Holofcener, Nia DaCosta, Taika Waititi, Ava DuVernay, Rian Johnson, Gina Prince-Bythewood, Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert and many more.",
      "\u201cFor me, the word to be underscored is \u2018independence.\u2019 I\u2019ve always believed in that word. That\u2019s what led to me eventually wanting to create a category that supported independent artists who weren\u2019t given a chance to be heard,\u201d Redford told The Associated Press in 2018. \u201cThe industry was pretty well controlled by the mainstream, which I was a part of. But I saw other stories out there that weren\u2019t having a chance to be told and I thought, \u2018Well, maybe I can commit my energies to giving those people a chance.\u2019 As I look back on it, I feel very good about that.\u201d",
      "In 2019, Redford said he intended to step back from his public facing role at the festival, though he remained the organization's president and founder until his death.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re at a point where I can move on to a different place, because the thing I\u2019ve missed over the years is being able to spend time with the films and with the filmmakers and to see their work and be part of their community,\u201d he said at the 2019 kickoff. \u201cI don\u2019t think the festival needs a whole lot of introduction now: It runs on its own course, and I\u2019m happy for that.\u201d",
      "Redford\u2019s love affair with Utah began much earlier, on a cross-country motorcycle road trip in 1961 when he bought 2 acres of land. By 1969, with more money in his pocket from his film successes, he\u2019d purchased 5,000 acres, some of which was a mountain resort but most of the land was for wilderness preserves. He named it Sundance, after his character in \u201cButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\u201d",
      "In 1981, the year he won best picture and director for \u201cOrdinary People,\u201d he established the Sundance Institute, a nonprofit organization and held the first filmmakers lab at the Sundance Mountain Resort, about 13 miles northeast of Provo. A few years later, in 1985, the institute took over what was then known as the U.S. Film Festival, which would later be renamed the Sundance Film Festival. The festival in the mid-80s hosted the Coen brothers \u201cBlood Simple\u201d and Jim Jarmusch\u2019s \u201cStranger Than Paradise.\u201d",
      "The festival was really put on the map when Soderbergh premiered \u201csex, lies and videotape\u201d in Park City in 1989. A true indie, the film went on to win the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes and get an Oscar nomination, but it was its box office success that ignited a veritable indie film boom. And Sundance was where all the discoveries were happening. In 1991, the festival premiered \u201cDaughters of the Dust,\u201d \u201cParis is Burning\u201d and \u201cSlacker,\u201d in 1992, Tarantino\u2019s \u201cReservoir Dogs,\u201d in 1993, Wes Anderson brought \u201cBottle Rocket,\u201d and in 1994 \u201cHoop Dreams\u201d and \u201cClerks.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for Robert Redford, independent art houses might not have succeeded,\u201d said Gary Meyer, cofounder of Landmark Theatre, and a former festival director at Telluride who also worked with Redford. \u201cHaving the \u2018Sundance Kid\u2019 give his stamp of approval to independent features and documentaries brought audiences to our theaters, while helping launch the careers of dozens of filmmakers \u2026 He made it \u2018cool\u2019 to see adventurous movies when they came to commercial neighborhood theaters.\u201d",
      "In 1994, the Sundance Institute also made a commitment to Indigenous filmmakers by launching a festival program to showcase Native and Indigenous films that continues to this day.",
      "The festival might get the most headlines, but it\u2019s the year-round work of the Institute that has really left a mark on independent cinema. The screenwriting and directing labs have been just as, if not more, influential in helping to launch the first films of many of Hollywood\u2019s top filmmakers over the past 40 years, under the leadership of Michelle Satter, who has helped shepherd projects from \u201cHard Eight\u201d to \u201cFruitvale Station\u201d and \u201cLove & Basketball.\u201d",
      "\u201cSundance changed the trajectory of my career,\u201d filmmaker and labs adviser Gina Prince-Bythewood told the AP in 2023. \u201cHow many of these special projects would have never seen the light of day without Michelle, without Robert Redford\u2019s vision, without this incredible place? It\u2019s actually really scary to think about.\u201d",
      "Native filmmaker Sterlin Harjo (\u201cRez Ball\u201d) said that his career as a young man was defined by Redford\u2019s support for independent cinema and supporting Native storytelling.",

      "The list of notable films that have played at Sundance grows every year.

      "Redford had worried for years that the festival had outgrown Park City, Utah. In 1996, an estimated 15,504 attended the festival. In 2015, the number had ballooned to 46,100. It peaked in 2018 with 124,900 festivalgoers. The festival estimated that the 2025 edition had 85,472 in-person attendees, a 17% increase from 2024.",
      "Earlier this year, the decision was made to relocate to Boulder, Colorado, starting in 2027. That means there will be one last festival in Park City in January.",
      "\u201cBob\u2019s vision launched a movement that, over four decades later, has inspired generations of artists and redefined cinema in the U.S. and around the world,\u201d Sundance leaders said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cThe vibrant storytelling landscape we cherish today, both as artists and audiences, is unimaginable without his passionate drive and principled leadership.\u201d",
      "There were already plans in the works to celebrate the vision of Redford. In the wake of his death, that tribute will be even more deeply felt.",
      "Former Sundance director John Cooper, a close friend of Redford\u2019s who led the festival from 2009 to 2020, told The Associated Press in an interview earlier this year that he felt like his role was \u201cto be a keeper of the flame for Robert Redford and his legacy.\u201d Now, Cooper, the artistic director of Sonoma's True West Film Center who is still a regular presence at Sundance said, that mission is more important than ever. It\u2019s \u201ca lot to process, going from a legacy that was alive in him to one we have to carry on,\u201d Cooper told the AP. That legacy, he said, centers on spreading the power of storytelling.",

      "Anthony Roth Costanzo, who introduced $11 tickets to Opera Philadelphia, aims to surprise audiences again with the company\u2019s new season as it celebrates its 50th anniversary",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- Anthony Roth Costanzo, the man who brought $11 opera tickets to Philadelphia, hopes to keep surprising audiences during the company\u2019s new season.",
      "\u201cIt is very much opera. It\u2019s dramatic, it\u2019s cathartic, it\u2019s collaborative in interdisciplinary ways,\u201d Costanzo said of Opera Philadelphia\u2019s 50th anniversary season \u2014 the first he\u2019s been able to plan since taking charge of the financially teetering company last year. \u201cBut it\u2019s different from what your perception of opera might be.\u201d",
      "He slated a work by Rossini to kick things off, with opening night set for Friday. But instead of choosing a repertory staple, Costanzo picked the less-familiar \u201cIl viaggio a Reims.\u201d And the production will be anything but traditional: Director Damiano Michieletto has changed the original setting from an inn to an art gallery where the portraits come alive and sing.",
      "After that the offerings become even more adventurous. There\u2019s a multimedia piece by playwright Sarah Ruhl set to music by Vivaldi \u2014 including \u201cThe Seasons\u201d \u2014 and starring Costanzo, who maintains a flourishing performing career as a countertenor. Then comes a world premiere with libretto by Pulitzer-winner Michael R. Jackson and a score by 10 different composers. Another new opera follows, by Gregory Spears, in which the chorus has the starring role. Finally, bass-baritone Dav\u00f3ne Tines performs a \u201cvaudevillian rendering\u201d of a poem by Langston Hughes.",
      "\u201cAs I put all of the pieces together, I thought, how can I encapsulate this in just a few simple words,\u201d Costanzo said. \u201cAnd what occurred to me was: \u2018Opera, but different.\u2019 And that is the slogan of the season.\u201d",
      "His pride in the lineup is understandable, especially given that when he took over it wasn\u2019t certain there would even be a 2025-26 season.",
      "The company was nearing bankruptcy and needed to quickly raise $4 million, he recalled.",
      "Almost immediately he instituted a \u201cpick your price\u201d policy under which people could buy tickets to any seat in the house starting at $11. (The website gives buyers a range of higher options and invites them to make a donation on top of the purchase. Season subscriptions at higher prices are also still available.)",
      "\u201cI said OK, I have to think like a venture capitalist,\u201d Costanzo said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to spend money to make money. Besides, he said, the old pricing system was projected to bring in only 8% of the revenue the company needed, so little was at risk from the new policy.",
      "The publicity and good will generated by the move helped the company quickly raise $7 million in donations, more than enough to retire the debt. When tickets went on sale for 2024-25, all three operas sold out within three weeks, and the season ended with a surplus of $2.4 million.",
      "Corrado Rovaris, the company\u2019s longtime music director, was on the podium for the season-opening performance last fall of Missy Mazzoli\u2019s \u201cThe Listeners,\u201d a recent work having its U.S. premiere.",
      "\u201cIt was amazing to see the reaction in the house,\u201d he recalled. \u201cBeautiful to see a full house but also to see such an enthusiastic house. Beautiful and very moving.\u201d",

      "In a good portent for the growth of the company\u2019s audience, two-thirds of those who chose the \u201cpick your price option\u201d had never bought tickets to Opera Philadelphia before, and most were under 45 years old. This year a similar percentage are either first-timers or repeats from last season.",
      "As a result of the brighter financial outlook, the new season offers twice as many performances as last, though the budget is still substantially lower than it was in 2017, when the company launched an adventurous festival format that had several different works in performance over a period of two weeks.",
      "Just how did Costanzo settle on that $11 figure?",
      "\u201cAt first I thought it should be $25,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the problem is that everywhere across the country I see \u2018tickets starting at $25\u2026\u2019 and I thought people would see that and think, Oh, yeah, you can sit up in the top balcony.",

      "The play \u201cArt\u201d returns to Broadway with a fresh revival and a starry cast",
      "For evidence of how high inflation has gotten, look no further than Broadway. The fancy painting at the heart of the play \u201cArt\u201d cost the equivalent of $40,000 in 1998. In a crackling new revival, it's a hefty $300,000.",
      "The painting in question is a 4-by-5-foot white-on-white work with white lines. Playwright Yasmina Reza puts it at the center of an escalating fight between three male, middle-aged friends that exposes their fault lines, leading to a night in which each are ripped apart by the others and putting a 25-year friendship in jeopardy.",
      "If $300,000 sounds like a ridiculous price for a monothematic canvas, you'll side with Marc, played with pitch-perfect exasperation by Bobby Cannavale. If the painting speaks to you, you'll be with Serge, a flinty, slightly full-of-himself Neil Patrick Harris. If you just want to hang out and not talk about the painting any more, you'll identify with James Corden's hapless Yvan.",
      "Under Scott Ellis' tight and enthralling direction and with three perfectly cast actors who seem to be having a ball at the Music Box Theatre, \u201cArt\u201d frequently erupts in laughter but still has plenty to say about friendship, power dynamics and how we get on each others' nerves. The 90-minute play opened Tuesday night.",

Designer David Rockwell puts the latest three lads in an elegant gray, spare living room that reeks of chilly luxury but also has little personality.",
      "Marc believes that Serge \u2014 by buying the Modernist painting against the express aesthetic rules followed by Marc \u2014 is indicating that he has stepped out of Marc\u2019s shadow. It is for him nothing less than a betrayal. Serge finds a new intolerance and inflexibility in his friend and a hostility to things new.

      "Cannavale's Marc is prone to outbursts and patting his friend's shoulders, less out of affection than an expression of dominance. Harris' Serge goes from needy to flinty to icy, and Corden fills his Yvan with the comedian's gift for physical comedy, literally plunging into a sofa to search for something or looking sheepish as he buttons a jacket.",
      "A highlight is a hysterical scene in which the three men, still festering their grievances, silently eat olives and drop the pits in a bowl with a loud ting. And Corden triggers a mid-show ovation after nailing a 900-word monster of a monologue that smacks of Mark Rylance doing something similar in the same theater in \u201cLa B\u00eate.\u201d",

He edited the film in France, co-financed it with a French company and, for the first time in more than a decade, traveled out of Iran to premiere the film in May at the Cannes Film Festival. There, it won the festival's top award and was acquired by Neon, which is planning an awards campaign.",
      "\u201cLet us join forces,\u201d Panahi said when accepting the Palme d'Or. \u201cNo one should dare tell us what kind of clothes we should wear, what we should do or what we should not do. The cinema is a society. Nobody is entitled to tell what we should or refrain from doing.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d is a revenge drama in which a group of former prisoners find the man they think could have been their torturer in prison. But because they were blindfolded while jailed, they struggle to be sure. Panahi drew from his own experience imprisoned in Tehran.",

      "OK, OK. So that\u2019s not necessarily the takeaway from \u201cHim,\u201d a new horror thriller about the religious fervor that goes with football.

      "Robert Redford, who died Tuesday at 89, was known for his deep commitment to activism, especially for Native American rights and the environment",
      "NEW YORK -- Lorie Lee Sekayumptewa, a former administrator with the Navajo Nation Film Office, remembers seeing Robert Redford at traditional cultural dances at the Hopi village of Hotevilla in New Mexico. It was more than 30 years ago and he was serving as executive producer of the 1991 release \u201cThe Dark Wind,\" a drama about Navajo life.",
      "Redford stood out for his Hollywood looks and for his un-Hollywood behavior, from his earnest desire to learn more about the tribe\u2019s spiritual knowledge to his visits to the Navajo Nation, where Sekayumptewa\u2019s father served as the dean of students at the tribal college and would show Redford\u2019s movies at the student union building.",
      "\u201cEven at home, he would bring that camera and film home to us, put up a sheet and we would invite our neighbors and the kids and we would all be there in our living room, watching these movies,\u201d the 54-year-old Sekayumptewa, who is Navajo, Hopi and Sac and Fox Nation, said of Redford.",
      "\u201cWe were all fans.\u201d",
      "Redford, who died Tuesday at age 89, was hardly the only liberal activist to emerge out of Hollywood, but few matched his knowledge and focus, his humility and dedication. Fellow actors and leaders of the causes he fought for spoke of his unusually deep legacy, his fight for Native Americans and the environment that began at the height of his stardom.",
      "In the mid-1970s, around the same time he was appearing in such blockbusters as \u201cThe Sting\u201d and \u201cThe Way We Were,\" he immersed himself in the emerging environmental movement. He successfully opposed a power plant being built in his adopted state, Utah, and lobbied for the landmark bills the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. He also joined the board of the non-profit Natural Resources Defense Council, where he remained a guiding force up to his death.",
      "\u201cHis legacy was extraordinary,\u201d says NRDC CEO and President Manish Bapna. \u201cOne of the things that was most extraordinary about him was that he understood the power of storytelling. He could talk about climate change and the toll it was inflicting on people and communities \u2014 the fisherman coping with rising seas, a family fleeing for their lives from a raging wildfire. He would record messages, give talks or speak in front of Congress.\"",
      "Bapna last saw Redford a few months ago, when they dined in New York City.",
      "\u201cHe chose his words carefully, and every word he said was profound. He said we must continue to find ways to tell stories that reach people,\u201d Bapna said.",
      "Redford had a longtime affinity for the environment. After growing up in Southern California in the 1930s and '40s, he was disheartened to see Los Angeles transform after World War II into a mecca of pollution and traffic jams. In the early 1960s, when he came upon Provo Canyon, Utah, during a cross-country motorcycle trip, he was so awed and invigorated by the landscape that he eventually settled in the area.",
      "Entertainers over time have come to identify and, be identified with, a given cause: Harry Belafonte and civil rights, Paul Newman and nuclear disarmament, Jane Fonda and the Vietnam War. Redford, as much as anyone, helped make the environment an issue for the Hollywood elite, whether for Fonda or Julia Louis-Dreyfus or Leonardo DiCaprio, a fellow NRDC board member who called Redford's death \u201ca huge loss to our community\u201d and cited his legacy an actor and activist.",

      "\u201cMore so than anything, he was a staunch environmental leader,\u201d DiCaprio said Monday.",
      "In 2013, Redford joined with then-Gov. Bill Richardson to create the Foundation to Protect New Mexico Wildlife to fight efforts by a Roswell, New Mexico, company and others to slaughter horses. The following year, the foundation reached an agreement with the Navajo Nation to manage thousands of wild horses on the reservation and keep the animals from being sent to slaughter houses.",
      "For Redford, the wild horse was representative of the American West. His advocacy also was channeled through the nonprofit group Return to Freedom, Wild Horse Conservation. The group posted on social media Tuesday that they were heartbroken.",
      "\u201cWe have all lost an irreplaceable artist, activist and environmentalist,\u201d said Neda DeMayo, founder of RTF. \u201cRobert Redford was and is an iconic and inspiring human being forever interwoven with the beauty and majesty of the West. I feel very grateful to have known him and to have had his support.\u201d",
      "Redford's activism extended to some of his film projects, whether the probes of the political system in \u201cAll the President's Men\u201d and \u201cThe Candidate\u201d or the drama \u201cThe Milagro Beanfield War,\u201d in which a local resident fights a real estate mogul for control of his land. His final work was \u201cDark Winds,\u201d an AMC show that premiered in 2022 and is based, like \u201cThe Dark Wind,\u201d on the fiction of Tony Hillerman.",

The show, Wirth said, gives audiences a look into the Navajo community, with actors and writers largely holding Native identities.",
      "Redford \u201cendeavored to give people a shot at making art, you know, where they maybe hadn\u2019t had the ability to have access to mainstream media.\u201d",

      "A vaccine advisory committee handpicked by U.S. Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. met in Atlanta for two days this week to consider various vaccine recommendations",
      "NEW YORK -- A vaccine advisory committee handpicked by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. met in Atlanta this week to consider whether to revise recommendations on shots against COVID-19, hepatitis B, and a combination shot that protects children against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox.",
      "The panel, which is charged with making vaccine recommendations, declined to recommend COVID-19 vaccines, saying instead that people could make individual decisions \u2014 a move that adds confusion as people weigh whether to get a dose this fall.",
      "During the sometimes chaotic two-day meeting, the panel also recommended new restrictions for a vaccine that protects against chickenpox as well as measles, mumps and rubella. In a surprise move, the group indefinitely postponed an expected vote on hepatitis B shots given to infants on the day they are born.",
      "With Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic, leading the country's health agencies, the meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, struck a different tone from past gatherings. Among the 12 members, all chosen this year by Kennedy after he fired the previous 17-member panel, are people who have criticized and spread misinformation about vaccines. Critics say the panel's makeup and agenda could sow distrust in the shots.",
      "The panel's recommendations will be sent to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an agency that has been rocked by disagreements over Kennedy's vaccine policies. The panel's recommendations are usually adopted by the CDC, and then widely followed by doctors and insurers.",
      "Here are some takeaways from the meeting.",
      "The panel on Friday debated COVID-19 vaccinations as the virus has remained a public health threat, resulting in 32,000 to 51,000 U.S. deaths last fall and winter, according to CDC data.",
      "Until now, the vaccinations had been routinely provided to nearly all Americans who wanted them. The Food and Drug Administration recently put new restrictions on this year\u2019s shots from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax, reserving them for people over 65 or younger ones who are deemed at higher risk from the virus.",
      "Panelists declined to recommend the shots for anyone, including seniors and high-risk populations. They said individuals could make their own decisions. Removing the recommendations that were previously in place may confuse Americans trying to decide whether and how to get their fall boosters.",
      "The panel also urged the CDC to adopt stronger language around claims of vaccine risks, despite pushback from outside medical groups who said the shots had a proven safety record from the billions of doses administered worldwide.",
      "The divided panel narrowly avoided urging states to require a prescription for the shot.",
      "Several states have announced policies to try to ensure people's access to COVID-19 vaccines, worried about Friday\u2019s ACIP decision. And a group representing most health insurers, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, said earlier this week that its members will continue covering the shots through 2026.",
      "The committee recommended that a combined vaccine known as MMRV should not be given to children under 4. Instead, they said in an 8-3 vote with one abstention, children in this age group should get separate vaccines \u2014 one for MMR and another for varicella, or chickenpox.",
      "Their discussions centered on rare feverish seizures that can occur in kids who receive the first dose, between the ages of 1 and 2. Medical experts agree these seizures, while potentially frightening for families, are not linked to brain function or school problems.",
      "In 2009, the ACIP changed a previous recommendation to advise that either the combination shot or separate shots were acceptable for the first dose.",
      "Some doctors and public health experts say they are not aware of any new safety data that would explain the revisiting of those vaccination recommendations.",
      "About 85% of children already receive separate doses for the first round, according to information presented at the meeting.",

Government insurance programs like Medicaid, for example, would have to stop paying for the early combo dose if the acting CDC director accepts the panel's guidance.",
      "Ever since the ACIP panel in 2005 recommended a dose of the hepatitis B vaccine for newborns, cases of the liver virus among infants have dropped by more than half.",
      "Nonetheless, the committee opted to revisit the guidance in this week's meeting, with members questioning whether babies born to moms who test negative for hepatitis B really need a vaccine at birth.",
      "The panelists considered whether to recommend delaying that initial vaccination \u2014 something doctors and parents already can choose to do.",
      "One committee member asked if the vaccination right after birth was \u201casking our babies to solve an adult problem.\u201d Hepatitis B can spread through sex, sharing needles, or from an infected mother to a newborn baby.",
      "But several outside medical experts criticized that the committee was debating the issue at all and said the vaccine is safe and successful at reducing infant infections.",
      "After discussing it on Thursday, the panel decided Friday morning to indefinitely postpone a vote on the issue.",
      "Chairman Martin Kulldorff opened the meeting by challenging former CDC directors to a public debate. Several doctors representing outside medical groups accused the panel of not following the CDC\u2019s long-established guidelines in weighing evidence for making recommendations.",
      "CDC staff, as usual, presented numerous studies on the topics being debated, explaining how they chose which research to discuss. But a few times, panel members cited different papers they had found, including ones done in mice, which are not generally considered applicable.",
      "The committee also took a vote on Thursday that they had to redo on Friday morning concerning the government\u2019s Vaccines for Children program, which covers vaccine costs for about half of U.S. kids. On Friday, they voted to align coverage under the program with their guidance on MMRV shots. A day earlier, they had voted no on the idea.",

      "At one point Thursday, one of the panelists appeared to be napping, with his eyes closed and his chin resting on his chest.",
      "Doctors and public health experts watching the meeting unfold said they are concerned that the committee is creating fear and mistrust around vaccines at a time when U.S. vaccination rates are already falling.",
      "They suggested the new panel was selectively using its recommendations to justify specific conclusions, rather than considering all the evidence.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s troubling to see the erosion of the committee\u2019s integrity,\u201d said Dr. Sandra Fryhofer of the American Medical Association.",

      "A government watchdog has raised concerns about high administrative costs in Georgia's Medicaid program",
      "ATLANTA -- A federal watchdog reported Thursday that Georgia\u2019s program requiring able-bodied adults to document low-paying work to get Medicaid has spent much more on administrative costs than on providing health care.",
      "The U.S. Government Accountability Office report on Georgia Pathways comes after Republicans mandated similar work requirements throughout the U.S. as part of the \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d signed into law by President Donald Trump.",
      "Starting in 2027, most adults who seek Medicaid coverage must first show they are working, taking classes or performing community service for at least 80 hours a month. And they must be extremely poor, earning incomes no higher than the federal poverty line.",
      "The report attributes most of the administrative costs to the implementation of changes in determining eligibility and enrolling people, along with duplicative technology, training and coordination while the state litigated to overcome Biden administration objections.",
      "\u201cNow the entire country can see what we in Georgia already know \u2014 Georgia\u2019s Medicaid work reporting requirement program is the real waste, fraud, and abuse,\u201d Sen. Raphael Warnock, one of the Georgia Democrats who requested the report. \u201cThis report shows that Pathways is incredibly effective at barring working people from health coverage and making corporate consultants richer,\" his statement said.",
      "A spokesperson for Republican Gov. Brian Kemp countered that Democrats are responsible for the extra spending.",
      "\u201cNow, as other states prepare to adopt our model and reject one-size-fits-none big government healthcare, Democrats like Senators Ossoff and Warnock are trying to rewrite history after four years of inaction and blame the State for costs associated with their own stonewalling.\"",
      "Millions of eligible people will lose coverage due to the Trump law because the administrative process will make it too difficult for them to repeatedly document their work, critics say, pointing to what happened in Georgia, which is so far the only state that imposes work requirements.",
      "Georgia has among the highest rates of uninsured and is one of 10 states that refused to expand Medicaid to all adults with incomes of up to 138% of the federal poverty level, as envisioned by President Barack Obama's health care overhaul.",
      "Instead, Kemp heralded his July 2023 launch of Georgia Pathways to Coverage, which limits Medicaid for adults to those who earn no more than poverty-level wages, now set at $15,650 a year. Georgia's traditional Medicaid still covers poorer children, disabled adults, poor people in nursing homes and a handful of other adults.",
      "Nationally, most adults on Medicaid in states that expanded it are already working, and in Georgia, an estimated 246,365 adults are potentially eligible for traditional Medicaid or Pathways. But a year after it launched, Pathways had enrolled around 4,300. As of this spring, there were 6,514 adults enrolled, according to the state Department of Community Health.",

      "Boar's Head officials have said they planned to reopen their plant in Jarratt, Virginia, in the coming months. The plant was shuttered after listeria-tainted liverwurst killed 10 people, sickened dozens and forced a recall of more than 7 million pounds of deli products. Federal officials said systemic problems at the plant caused the outbreak.",
      "Officials with the U.S. Agriculture Department lifted the plant's suspension in July and said that federal inspectors would assume direct oversight of operations.",
      "Documents obtained by the AP showed problems at plants in Arkansas, Indiana and a different site in Virginia.

      "Boar's Head officials said they were reviewing the letter.",
      "\u201cIn our more than 120-year history, what happened at our Jarratt facility was the first time that such an event occurred,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe moved quickly, aggressively and decisively in close collaboration with regulators and leading food safety experts to identify the root cause of the problem and implement enhancements to our food manufacturing nationwide to prevent something like this from ever happening again.\u201d",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "NEW YORK -- Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s new vaccine advisory committee meets this week, with votes expected on whether to change recommendations on shots against COVID-19, hepatitis B and chickenpox.",
      "The exact questions to be voted on Thursday and Friday in Atlanta are unclear. Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to questions seeking details to a newly posted agenda, although the department announced five additional appointments to the committee Monday.",
      "Some public health experts are worried that the votes will \u2014 at a minimum \u2014 raise unwarranted new questions about vaccines in the minds of parents.",
      "Perhaps even more consequential would be a vote that restricts a government program from paying for vaccines for low-income families.",
      "\u201cI'm tightening my seat belt,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University vaccines expert.",
      "The panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, makes recommendations to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on how already-approved vaccines should be used. CDC directors have almost always accepted those recommendations, which are widely heeded by doctors and guide vaccination programs.",
      "Kennedy, a leading antivaccine activist before becoming the nation\u2019s top health official, fired the entire 17-member panel earlier this year and replaced it with a group that includes several anti-vaccine voices.",
      "Here's a look at the three vaccines being discussed:",
      "Before Kennedy was health secretary, ACIP would typically vote in June to reaffirm recommendations for shots against respiratory viruses that sicken millions of Americans each fall and winter.",
      "This past June, Kennedy's ACIP voted to recommend flu shots for Americans but was silent on COVID-19 shots.",
      "Before that meeting, Kennedy announced he was removing COVID-19 shots from the CDC's recommendations for healthy children and pregnant women. The move was heavily criticized by doctors' groups and public health organizations, and prompted a lawsuit by the American Academy of Pediatrics and other groups.",
      "Days after Kennedy's announcement, CDC officials said families could still get the 2024-2025 version of COVID-19 shots for their kids in consultation with their doctors. That clarification meant shots would still be covered by the federal government's Vaccines For Children program, which pays for shots for families who lack money or adequate health insurance coverage. It's now responsible for roughly half of childhood vaccinations in the U.S. each year.",
      "As with flu shots, however, there are new COVID-19 formulations each fall, to account for changes in which strains are circulating. The committee has not yet voted on whether to recommend this season's COVID-19 shots or whether those shots should be covered by the VFC program.",
      "Further complicating the picture: When the FDA last month licensed this fall's COVID-19 shots, the agency took the unusual step of narrowing their use for healthy younger adults and children.",
      "If the ACIP simply follows that, and if there is no additional clarifying language from the CDC, then \u201cthat would take away access for roughly half of America\u2019s kids,\u201d said Dr. Sean O'Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "The pediatricians group urges that vaccinations continue for all children ages 6 months to 2 years.",
      "Hepatitis B can cause serious liver infections. In adults, the virus is spread through sex or through sharing needles during use injection-drug use.",
      "But the virus also can be passed to a baby from an infected mother, and as many as 90% of infected infants go on to have chronic infections.",
      "A hepatitis B vaccine was first licensed in the U.S. in 1981. In 2005, the ACIP recommended a dose within 24 hours of birth for all medically stable infants who weigh at least 4.4 pounds (2 kilograms).",
      "Infant vaccinations are stressed for women who have hepatitis B or, crucially, who have not been tested for it. The infant shots are 85% to 95% effective in preventing chronic hepatitis B infections, studies have shown.",
      "Newborn hepatitis B vaccinations are considered a success, and no recent peer-reviewed research shows any safety problem with giving kids the shots on their first day of life, Schaffner said.",

      "In 2005, a combination MMRV shot \u2014 measles, mumps, rubella and varicella \u2014 was licensed. The CDC initially recommended that doctors and parents use the combo shot over separate MMR and varicella injections.",

      "She isolated from loved ones after the 2023 disaster while struggling to process the grief, often angry that her family didn't have a permanent place to stay and that so many others were unable to evacuate.",
      "Moving between high schools, she never felt welcome, Palacio said, and the pain only intensified as the months wore on. Finally, near the first anniversary of the fires, Palacio reached out for help.",
      "Hundreds of students like Palacio have struggled mentally since the fires \u2013 and not all have received the help they need.",
      "The Hawaii Department of Education estimates more than a third of Maui students lost a family member, sustained a serious injury or had a parent lose a job after the fires, which killed 102 people and damaged more than 3,300 properties in Lahaina.",

      "AP is collaborating with Honolulu Civil Beat, CalMatters, Blue Ridge Public Radio, and Centro de Periodismo Investigativo in Puerto Rico to examine how school communities are recovering from the disruption of natural disasters.",
      "____",
      "Two years later, many in Lahaina are ready to return to normal. But therapists say students\u2019 mental health challenges continue to mount.",
      "That\u2019s common after a disaster, especially at the two-year mark, when adrenaline wears off and stress remains high, said Christopher Knightsbridge, one of several researchers at the University of Hawaii who has studied the well-being of Lahaina fire survivors. While kids may feel numb immediately following a disaster, after two years, they\u2019re facing the toll of constant uncertainty and change, he said.",
      "It\u2019s a phenomenon seen wherever schooling has been disrupted by natural disasters, reporting by Honolulu Civil Beat, The Associated Press and several other news outlets shows. But a couple years after the disaster, schools are not always prepared with extra mental health supports.",
      "On Maui, the island is dealing with an ongoing shortage of specialists. In the past few years, the number of psychiatrists serving youth has dropped from four to two, even as demand has grown.",
      "\u201cThe crisis isn\u2019t over,\u201d Knightsbridge said.",
      "Palacio made progress with the help of a school counselor and then a local organization that supports teens\u2019 mental health through outdoor activities and adventures.",
      "The senior at Lahainaluna High School said she\u2019s now more comfortable confiding in others and controlling her emotions. She takes pride in mentoring younger students who also have struggled since the fires.",
      "Two years in, many kids still wrestle with depression and anxiety.",
      "DayJahiah Valdivia, a senior at K\u012bhei Charter School, said her stress levels spike when there are strong winds or small brush fires. Valdivia lives in Upcountry Maui, which also faced wildfires that burned over a thousand acres of land on the same day as the 2023 Lahaina fires. Her home was spared, but it took months for her family to return because their property was covered in soot and needed professional cleaning.",
      "She feels less anxious now that her family members have discussed their escape plan for future disasters. But a summer fire near a friend\u2019s home in Central Maui renewed her fears about her loved ones\u2019 safety.",
      "\u201cThe anxiety never really wore off,\u201d she said. On windy days, it was especially difficult to concentrate in class or feel safe.",
      "In a University of Hawaii study of fire survivors conducted in 2024, just over half of children reported symptoms of depression, and 30% were likely facing an anxiety disorder. Nearly half of kids in the study, ages 10 to 17, were experiencing PTSD.",
      "Children in disaster-torn towns across the U.S. can relate.",
      "In Paradise, California, where the 2018 Camp Fire took 85 lives, a protracted period of disillusionment followed what some called the \u201chero phase,\u201d when the community pulled together and vowed to resurrect their town. Both Lahaina and Paradise had housing shortages after their fires, so families had to move away or live with friends to go to school or work in the area. In general, students who don\u2019t have a permanent living arrangement tend to struggle more academically and have more behavioral challenges, research shows.",
      "Many Paradise students still struggle with anxiety and grief, seven years later, making it difficult to fully engage in school. A year after the Camp Fire, 17% of students were homeless, and the suspension rate was 7.4%, compared to 2.5% statewide. The suspension rate remained nearly triple the state average last year, and more than 26% were chronically absent.",
      "Aryah Berkowitz, who lost her home, two dogs and her family\u2019s business in the Paradise blaze, dealt with lingering behavioral challenges following the disaster. For nearly a year afterward, her family of seven, plus a pair of surviving pit bull-Labrador mixes, lived with a friend in nearby Chico, sharing two bedrooms and a bathroom. Berkowitz, then in sixth grade, slept on the couch.",
      "\u201cI was having to help my family a lot and wasn\u2019t able to handle it,\u201d said Berkowitz , once a high-achieving student who was suspended twice after the fire. \u201cI was holding it inside and took it out on other people. Some days I\u2019d just walk out of class.\u201d",

      "\u201cThey just sort of vanished,\u201d Chapin said.",
      "Maui has long dealt with medical workforce challenges. Even before the fires, it faced a shortage of mental health professionals because they struggled with the state\u2019s high cost of living and housing shortage.",
      "The fires brought burnout and greater economic obstacles, only exacerbating the issue. Since then, Hawaii\u2019s education department has tried to bulk up Maui\u2019s mental health staff by bringing in providers from neighbor islands and the mainland and, more recently, using a $2 million federal grant to support students.",
      "But hiring mental health staff has been so difficult that even the federal money hasn\u2019t made much of a dent. In the first nine months of the grant, the state education department primarily used the money to bus displaced students from other parts of the island to Lahaina schools.",
      "The state has used the money to hire five part-time mental health providers working with students and staff, including one specialist who works in the evenings with students living as boarders on Lahainaluna\u2019s campus, said Kimberly Lessard, a Department of Education district specialist.",
      "Two of the six behavioral health specialist positions in Lahaina schools remained unfilled this summer, as they have been for years due to Maui\u2019s housing shortage and high cost of living, Lessard said.",
      "Valdivia, who still struggles with anxiety from the Upcountry Maui fires, has seen the impacts of the provider shortage firsthand. She\u2019s on a two- to three-month waiting list to see a psychiatrist on Maui, and she\u2019s seeing an O\u02bbahu-based therapist via telehealth because there aren\u2019t enough providers who can meet with her in person.",
      "\u201cEven just to get evaluated (by a psychiatrist), it\u2019s literally months,\u201d she said. \u201cI just think that\u2019s crazy.\u201d",

      "In Puerto Rico, which has suffered from a series of disasters since Hurricane Maria struck in 2017, students have experienced high rates of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.",
      "Yet despite legislation in 2000 to create more school psychologist positions, it wasn\u2019t until the pandemic that the commonwealth\u2019s Education Department dedicated money to hire them. Today, there are 58 vacancies across the archipelago\u2019s 870 schools.",
      "The school psychologists \u201ccan\u2019t keep up,\u201d said Nellie Zambrana, a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Puerto Rico at R\u00edo Piedras. Those who are working are overstretched, according to a study by the university\u2019s Psychological Research Institute. One psychologist, the study said, was assigned to more than 100 students at three schools.",
      "Loren Lapow wasn\u2019t deterred by the storm clouds gathering one June afternoon over D.T. Fleming Beach on Maui. The social worker helped teens carry an inflatable paddleboard to the water\u2019s edge, cheering them on as they swam.",
      "Amid the fun, Lapow directed the teens to reflect on their fears and losses. He asked them how they feel when they smell smoke or think about Lahaina\u2019s famed Front Street, most of which was destroyed in the blaze.",
      "\u201cPlaces are like a friend to us,\u201d Lapow said. \u201cWhen you lose places, it hurts.\u201d",
      "Lapow founded the Maui Hero Project, which his website describes as \u201cadventure-based counseling services.\u201d The eight-week program Lapow started 25 years ago teaches teens basic disaster preparedness skills and immerses them in outdoor activities. It's also a form of mental health support, which Lapow has leaned into since the wildfires.",
      "Lapow\u2019s approach has become a common strategy for nonprofits and therapists trying to reach kids who have balked at discussing their mental health since the fires. But those efforts don't always reach the kids who need the most help.",
      "There\u2019s a strong stigma around seeking mental health services, particularly in Filipino and Latino communities that make up a large portion of Lahaina\u2019s population, said Ruben Juarez, a professor at University of Hawaii who led the research study on fire survivors. Families may see counseling as a sign of weakness, and children may be reluctant to open up to therapists out of fear of being judged or scrutinized, he added.",
      "Yet in the study, Latino teens reported the highest rates of severe depressive and PTSD symptoms. Filipino teens reported some of the highest rates of anxiety.",
      "The state is hoping struggling students will open up to their peers. A new program called YouthLine will train Hawaii teens to respond to crisis calls, said Keli Acquaro, who oversees youth mental health for the state.",
      "Keakealani Cashman, who graduated from Kamehameha Schools Maui in 2024, is hoping to be part of the state\u2019s solution to provide more mental health support to the next generation of children.",
      "After losing her home to the fires, Cashman spent her senior year talking to Native Hawaiian practitioners and researching how cultural values, such as connections to the land and her ancestors, could help her community heal from the trauma of the fires. The project helped her own mental health improve, said Cashman, who regularly met with her school\u2019s behavioral health specialist.",
      "Now, Cashman is entering her second year at Brigham Young University Hawaii and hopes to work as a behavioral health specialist in Hawaiian language immersion schools",
      "\u201cThis horrible, horrible thing happened to me and my family, but I don\u2019t have to let it kill the rest of my life,\u201d Cashman said. \u201cI can really help my family, my community in school, and just make an impact in what I know how to do.\u201d",

      "Only an initial 400 doses of the Ervebo vaccine have been dispatched, with the rest to be delivered later, the WHO said. The operation has been hampered by limited access and scarce funds.",

      "HONG KONG -- Thousands of people were evacuated from their homes in Hong Kong overnight so experts could defuse a large U.S.-made bomb left over from World War II that was discovered at a construction site.",
      "Police said the bomb was 1.5 meters (nearly 5 feet) in length and weighed about 1,000 pounds (450 kilograms). It was discovered by construction workers in Quarry Bay, a bustling residential and business district on the west side of Hong Kong island.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- With little chance of NATO membership for Ukraine, the country\u2019s Western allies have bought into an alternate strategy for helping it repel Russian aggression: invest billions in Ukraine's weapons industry so it can better defend itself.",
      "If the strategy works, Ukraine's weapons industry will eventually be able to help equip U.S. and European armies, too, with cutting-edge drones and other military technology being developed in the midst of its war with Russia.",
      "One recent advance in Ukraine\u2019s homegrown arsenal is a quadcopter drone that can evade Russian jamming devices, fly more than 20 kilometers (12 miles) and drop six kilograms (13 pounds) of guided explosives onto tanks and other high-value targets.",
      "\u201cThe Ukrainians are the leaders in the world in terms of drone technology,\u201d Keith Kellogg, the Trump administration's special envoy for Ukraine said last week at a conference in Kyiv. \u201cWe are working with Ukrainians now to make sure we have got this drone technology exchange, which I think is very important.\u201d",
      "Europeans have been taking the threat from Russia more seriously since the second Trump administration began signaling that NATO members shouldn\u2019t be overly reliant on the U.S. to defend them. Anxieties across Europe were heightened last week after Russian drones launched from Belarus were shot down in Polish airspace.",
      "For its part, Ukraine is seeking investment to triple its weapons production, become less reliant on Western partners to fight Russia \u2013 and hopefully deter future conflicts.",
      "Ukraine's weapons industry now meets nearly 60% of its army's needs, up from 10% when Russia's full-scale invasion began 3 1/2 years ago, according to its defense minister. But its military budget \u2014 $64 billion in 2024 \u2014 is less than half the size of Russia's, which is why it turns to Western allies for weapons and, increasingly, money.",
      "In addition to any private investment, and in lieu of NATO membership, security guarantees for Ukraine will likely center on European governments investing in its army \u2014 essentially paying Kyiv to build its own weapons and plugging in production gaps with mutually beneficial joint ventures.",
      "European countries are eager to do this, said Fabien Hinz of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. \u201cUkraine has the advantage of having battle-tested systems, of having quite low production costs and having entities in place capable of producing these systems rapidly.\u201d",
      "For both sides, the war has necessitated fast cycles of innovation as a matter of survival. How quickly a weapon can be developed, shipped to an army unit and improved upon is a matter of life and death.",
      "Like most defense companies in Ukraine, the maker of the R-34 quadcopter drone \u2014 FRDM \u2014 communicates with soldiers at all hours of the day and quickly incorporates feedback. Its founder, Vadym Yunyk, is guided by the motto: Robots should die in the front lines, not people.",
      "That underscores one of Ukraine's disadvantages in this war \u2014 its lack of soldiers, which has been a key driver of innovation for Ukrainian defense companies.",
      "Investments in artificial intelligence and robotics are enabling Ukraine to do what its allies could scarcely have imagined before Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. With help from drones and autonomous vehicles, Ukrainian forces can now strike targets with remote-controlled weapons further afield and more precisely, as well as deliver supplies and evacuate the wounded from the front lines without risking other soldiers' lives.",
      "Ukraine's small first-person view, or FPV, drones, are responsible for nearly 70% of Russian losses in manpower and weaponry within 15 kilometers of the front line, according to Ukrainian officials.",
      "At the other end of the spectrum are its deep strike drones, which can reach over 1,000 kilometers to hit targets deep inside Russian territory.",
      "FRDM's quadcopter lies somewhere in the middle. The latest version of the weapon was modified from an earlier model to fly three times farther and carry more guided bombs.",
      "\u201cWe learned very quickly how to scale any production. If the government places an order to produce 10,000 drones a year instead of 3,000, I will be capable of doing this in a month and a half,\u201d Yunyk said.",

      "KARBALA, Iraq -- Iraq is set to open the country\u2019s first industrial-scale solar plant Sunday in a vast expanse of desert in Karbala province, southwest of Baghdad.",
      "It\u2019s part of a new push by the government to expand renewable energy production in a country that is frequently beset by electricity crises despite being rich in oil and gas.",
      "\u201cThis is the first project of its type in Iraq that has this capacity,\u201d said Safaa Hussein, executive director of the new solar plant in Karbala, standing in front of row after row of black panels. From above, the project looks like a black-clad city surrounded by sand.",
      "The plant aims to \u201csupply the national network with electricity, and reduce the fuel consumption especially during the daytime peak load, in addition to reducing the negative environmental impact of gas emissions,\u201d he said.",
      "The newly opened solar plant in Karbala will eventually be able to produce up to 300 megawatts of electricity at its peak, said Nasser Karim al-Sudani, head of the national team for solar energy projects in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office. Another project under construction in Babil province will have a capacity of 225 megawatts, and work will also begin soon on a 1,000 megawatt project in the southern province of Basra, he said.",
      "The projects are part of an ambitious plan to implement large-scale solar power projects in an effort to ease the country\u2019s chronic electricity shortages.",
      "Deputy Minister of Electricity Adel Karim said Iraq has solar projects with a combined capacity of 12,500 megawatts either being implemented, in the approval process, or under negotiation. If fully realized, these projects would supply between 15% and 20% of Iraq\u2019s total electricity demand, excluding the semi-autonomous northern Kurdish region, he said.",
      "\u201cAll the companies we have contracted with, or are still negotiating with, will sell us electricity at very attractive prices, and we will in turn sell it to consumers,\u201d Karim said, although he declined to disclose the purchase rates.",

      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says the EU should slap new sanctions on Russia\u2019s exports of liquefied natural gas, its shadow fleet of aging oil tankers and major energy companies over its war on Ukraine",
      "BRUSSELS -- The European Union should slap new sanctions on Russia\u2019s exports of liquefied natural gas, its shadow fleet of aging oil tankers and major energy companies over its war on Ukraine, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Friday.",
      "\u201cIt is time to turn off the tap\u201d on LNG, von der Leyen said in a video statement outlining her commission's new sanctions proposals. They must be endorsed by the 27 EU countries before they can enter force.",
      "\u201cI now call on member states to quickly endorse these new sanctions. We want Russia to leave the battlefield and come to the negotiation table, and this is the way to give peace a real chance,\u201d she said.",
      "The bloc has already agreed on 18 packages of sanctions against Russia, but getting final agreement on who and what to target can take weeks.",
      "More than 2,500 \u201centities\u201d including banks, ministries, energy companies and officials have already been hit.",
      "The officials include President Vladimir Putin and his associates, scores of Russian lawmakers and several oligarchs. Travel bans and asset freezes are the most common measures.",
      "Energy revenue is the linchpin of Russia\u2019s economy, allowing Putin to pour money into the armed forces without worsening inflation for everyday people and avoiding a currency collapse.",

      "Part of the plan would be to go \u201cafter those who fuel Russia\u2019s war by purchasing oil in breach of the sanctions,\" she said. Von der Leyen said that the commission wants to \u201ctarget refineries, oil traders, petrochemical companies and third countries including China.\u201d",
      "The sanctions would also include export restrictions on \u201citems and technologies\u201d that can be used on the battlefield. A further 45 companies in Russia and elsewhere would be hit, for \u201cproviding direct or indirect support to the Russian military industrial complex,\u201d the commission president said.",

    "story": [
      "The Vatican\u2019s \u201ctrial of the century\u201d is heading into the appeals phase",
      "VATICAN CITY -- The Vatican\u2019s \u201c trial of the century \u201d had it all: part Dan Brown thriller, part John Grisham legal drama, part low-brow Shakespeare tragicomedy.",
      "The financial whodunnit about the Holy See\u2019s bungled 350 million euro investment in a London property was notable for its surreal cast of characters and exposure of Vatican vendettas, espionage and even papal ransom payments to Islamic militants.",
      "The appeals trial opening Monday could be just as explosive.",
      "WHY THIS MATTERS: The hearings could expose even more unwanted revelations about the Vatican\u2019s inner workings, including details about Pope Francis\u2019 hands-on role in the whole, sordid affair. That\u2019s because thousands of pages of private text messages among the players recently became public.",
      "The original trial opened in 2021 with its main focus on the London luxury property. \u202fProsecutors alleged brokers and Vatican monsignors fleeced the Holy See of tens of millions of euros in fees and commissions to acquire the property, then extorted the Holy See for 15 million euros ($16.5 million) to cede control of it.",
      "TANGENTS EMERGED: The original investigation spawned two main tangents involving Cardinal Angelo Becciu, a once-powerful cardinal.",
      "One of those tangents led to the extraordinary revelation that Francis had approved paying up to 1 million euros in ransom to free a nun kidnapped by al-Qaida linked Islamic militants in Mali.",
      "WHO WAS CONVICTED: Becciu was convicted of embezzlement for sending 100,000 euros in Vatican money to a charity controlled by his brother, and paying hundreds of thousands of euros in Vatican money to a self-styled security analyst. He was sentenced to 5\u00bd years in prison.",
      "The tribunal convicted eight other defendants of embezzlement, abuse of office, fraud and other charges, but acquitted them of many counts.",
      "All the defendants maintained their innocence and appealed.",
      "THE TEXT MESSAGES In the two years since the verdicts were delivered, thousands of pages of WhatsApp text and audio messages exchanged between some of the players have become public, throwing fresh doubt about the credibility of the trial and the Vatican legal system. These private communications, published by Domani newspaper, suggest questionable conduct by Vatican police, prosecutors and the late pope \u2014 and a behind-the-scenes effort to target Becciu.",
      "\u2033If it gets out that we all agreed, it\u2019s the end,\u201d warned one message. \u201cBecause if we all knew, the trial is null and void and it\u2019s a conspiracy.\u201d",
      "Lawyers for Becciu and other defendants seek to enter the chats into evidence; at least one devoted 80 pages of his appeals motion to them. The lawyers say the chats bolster their claims that their clients didn\u2019t get a fair trial in an absolute monarchy where Francis intervened repeatedly in the investigation. They say the chats prove the investigation that led to the trial, willed by Francis as a sign of his commitment to financial reform, was contaminated from the start.",
      "WHAT IT COULD CHANGE: Even if the chats are admitted, it\u2019s unclear what effect they might have on the appeals, since the original verdicts were based on other evidence. Vatican officials have dismissed their relevance, saying the tribunal didn\u2019t rely on the testimony of any of the people involved.",
      "But the chats have already spawned follow-on criminal complaints in Vatican and Italian courts, and will likely be used by the defense in further appeals and legal wrangling. Once the Vatican verdicts become definitive, Italian, British and other courts will be asked to implement them, including with possible prison sentences or financial damages seized from frozen bank accounts. Those foreign courts may weigh whether the Vatican trial was fair, and some defense lawyers say they are prepared to take their claims that it wasn\u2019t to the European Court of Human Rights.",
      "The Holy See insists the trial was fair and the defense was given every opportunity to present its side.",
      "THE PROSECUTORS\u2019 APPEALS While Becciu and eight others were convicted of some financial crimes, the tribunal largely threw out prosecutors\u2019 overarching theory of a grand plot to defraud the Holy See. Prosecutor Alessandro Diddi, who will also prosecute the appeals case, has doubled down on his original thesis and asked the court to reconsider all but a few of its acquittals.",
      "In a text message to The Associated Press, Diddi declined to comment on the chats.",
      "CARDINAL ANGELO BECCIU The once-powerful cardinal had been considered a papal contender in a future conclave. Francis fired him in 2020, before he was charged, after becoming convinced he was involved in financial misconduct stemming from his time as the No. 3 in the secretariat of state.",
      "MONSIGNOR ALBERTO PERLASCA Perlasca was Becciu\u2019s deputy and headed the Vatican administrative office that handled the London investment. Because of that role, Perlasca was initially a prime suspect. But after his first round of questioning in April 2020, Perlasca fired his lawyer, changed his story and began cooperating with prosecutors.",
      "Perlasca escaped indictment and was eventually listed as an injured party, entitling him to damages. Only during the trial did it emerge that Perlasca had been persuaded to change his story to turn on Becciu.",

      "FRANCESCA CHAOUQUI Perhaps none of the trial\u2019s surreal twists was as jaw-dropping as when Chaouqui, a controversial figure from the Vatican\u2019s past, emerged as having had the starring role in persuading Perlasca to change his testimony.",
      "Chaouqui, a public relations specialist, is known for her role in the \u201cVatileaks\u201d scandal of 2015-2016, when she was convicted by the same tribunal of conspiring to leak confidential Vatican documents to journalists and received a 10-month suspended sentence.",
      "When Perlasca was being questioned on the stand, it emerged that Chaouqui had engaged in an elaborate plot with a Perlasca family friend to persuade him to turn on Becciu.",
      "Chaouqui declined the AP\u2019s request for comment.",
      "KEY BACKGROUND: Chaouqui openly nurtured a grudge against Becciu because she blamed him for her Vatileaks prosecution. She saw the London investigation as a chance to expose what she said were Becciu\u2019s lies and crimes, but she needed Perlasca to turn on Becciu to accomplish it.",
      "GENEVIEVE CIFERRI Ciferri is the family friend desperate to help Perlasca avoid prosecution. The 3,225 pages of WhatsApp messages are the four years of correspondence, from 2020-2024, between her and Chaouqui. According to the chats, the two devised a plan in which Chaouqui posed as a retired magistrate and passed legal advice onto Perlasca via Ciferri. Ciferri turned over some of the messages to Vatican prosecutors after she grew suspicious of Chaouqui, whom she believed had lied about her close relations to the investigators and Francis.",
      "In a statement to AP, Ciferri said the chats were of no importance to the appeals trial itself, since the convictions didn\u2019t hinge on Perlasca\u2019s testimony. She said the chats were instead a \u201ccollateral\u201d affair that was being investigated separately.",
      "\u201cContinuing to exaggerate the importance of the chat messages makes no sense and is only a useless pretext, while the appeal will be based on the actual crimes and the individual responsibilities of each person for each count,\u201d Ciferri wrote.",
      "The Vatican hasn\u2019t disputed the authenticity of the audio or commented on its contents.",
      "POPE FRANCIS The trial revealed that Francis had intervened in the investigation by penning four secret decrees that greatly benefited prosecutors. The decrees, signed in 2019 and 2020, gave prosecutors wide-ranging powers to investigate, including via unchecked wiretapping and deviating from existing laws.",
      "Defense lawyers said such secret intervention in a criminal investigation by an absolute monarch with supreme legislative, executive and judicial power confirmed that there was no separation of powers in the Vatican and that the defendants couldn\u2019t get a fair trial.",
      "The tribunal dismissed the significance of the decrees. The prosecutor defended them for providingunspecified guarantees.",
      "FRANCIS\u2019 MESSAGES: But then came the WhatsApp messages, which showed Francis had an even greater role. There are references to prosecutors speaking with Francis about the investigation, claims by Chaouqui that she was working for him and detailed descriptions of interactions between Francis and Perlasca, who lived in the same Vatican hotel.",
      "Francis even lent Perlasca money after his Vatican bank accounts were frozen, the correspondence shows.",
      "The messages include photographs of correspondence between Francis and Perlasca, including one in which Perlasca asks the pope for forgiveness and for help getting a new job in the Vatican diplomatic service once he had decided to cooperate with prosecutors. In another, the pope encouraged him on the eve of his second round of questioning, when he turned definitively on Becciu.",
      "\u201cDear brother,\u201d Francis wrote Perlasca Aug. 19, 2020, a few days before the questioning. \u201cThanks so much for your letter of yesterday. I am close to you and I pray for you. Please do the same for me. You can count on me.\u201d",

      "VATICAN CITY -- In the last two years, defense lawyers have acquired 3,225 pages of WhatsApp messages between two women who were tangential to the Vatican's \u201ctrial of the century,\u201d but were actually intimately aware of the investigation and in some ways involved.",
      "Their four years of conversations, from 2020-2024, provide a parallel, behind-the-scenes version of one of the most tumultuous periods in Vatican history, when Pope Francis authorized a trial of 10 people, including a cardinal, into alleged financial misconduct.",
      "The chats, written in Italian and translated here by The Associated Press, suggest that these two women helped persuade one of the original prime suspects in the case, Monsignor Alberto Perlasca, to change his story and turn on his former boss, Cardinal Angelo Becciu. Perlasca was spared indictment; Becciu was convicted.",
      "According to the chats, first reported on by Domani newspaper and published by other Italian media, public relations specialist Francesca Chaouqui implied to Perlasca family friend Genevieve Ciferri that she enjoyed close contact with Vatican investigators and Francis, and wanted to help Perlasca. She assured Ciferri that everyone from the pope on down knew and approved of their maneuvering to help Perlasca feel supported so he would implicate Becciu.",
      "Ciferri feared that Chaouqui was just boasting and on May 19, 2024, she demanded Chaouqui reassure her that police, Prosecutor Alessandro Diddi and Francis all \u201cknew and agreed on your collaboration with the investigations, and in particular had direct knowledge of the collaboration you established with me.\u201d",
      "Chaouqui assures her they were in agreement but warned: \u201cIf it gets out that we all agreed, it\u2019s the end.\u201d",
      "Ciferri: \u201cPlease be clear, you understand how important it is for me to be fully convinced. Because you know the doubts and skepticism to which, due to my weakness and insecurity, I have always been subject during our relationship, which has now turned into affection. Are you confirming that all the people I mentioned, including the Holy Father, were in agreement and aware of everything? And are you confirming that you have never lied to me about anything? And do you also make me understand how serious it could be for the trial if both you and Prof. Diddi are found to have lied shamelessly during the proceedings? Because then I too would agree that for the good of the church, it would be better to put a tombstone on it!\u201d",

      "BRUSSELS -- A cyberattack targeting check-in and boarding systems disrupted air traffic and caused delays at several of Europe\u2019s major airports on Saturday, officials said, though the initial impact appeared to be limited.",
      "The disruptions to electronic systems initially reported at Brussels, Berlin's Brandenburg and London's Heathrow airports meant that only manual check-in and boarding was possible. Many other European airports said their operations were unaffected.",
      "\u201cThere was a cyberattack on Friday night 19 September against the service provider for the check-in and boarding systems affecting several European airports including Brussels Airport,\u201d said Brussels Airport in a statement, initially reporting a \u201clarge impact\u201d on flight schedules.",
      "Airports said the issue centered around a provider of check-in and boarding systems \u2014 not airlines or the airports themselves.",
      "Collins Aerospace, whose systems help passengers check themselves in, print boarding passes and bag tags and dispatch their luggage from a kiosk, cited a \u201ccyber-related disruption\u201d to its MUSE (Multi-User System Environment) software at \u201cselect airports.\u201d",
      "As the day wore on, the fallout appeared to be contained.",
      "Brussels Airport spokesperson Ihsane Chioua Lekhli told broadcaster VTM that by mid-morning, nine flights had been canceled, four were redirected to another airport and 15 faced delays of an hour or more. She said it wasn\u2019t immediately clear how long the disruptions might last.",

      "Every Sept. 19, Mexico City holds an earthquake drill",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Every Sept. 19, residents of Mexico City ask themselves an unsettling question: \u201cIs the ground shaking?\u201d",
      "On that day 40 years ago, at 7:19 a.m., a 8.1-magnitude earthquake and its aftershocks left the Mexican capital devastated. Official counts put the death toll around 12,000, but the real number remains unknown.",
      "The earthquake was a watershed moment for the city. A new culture of civil defense evolved, better warning systems developed, building codes changed and, since 2004, there have been annual earthquake drills held on that day.",
      "Then, on that very same day in 2017, things changed again. Barely two hours after the annual drill, a 7.1-magnitude temblor began shaking the ground; its epicenter was so close to the capital that the warning alarms didn\u2019t even sound.",
      "Nearly 400 died this time and word spread in an instant on social media, but the destruction showed some lessons still hadn\u2019t been learned, as many deaths could have been prevented.",
      "Whether the ground shakes or not, Sept. 19 continues to rattle residents of the capital, because for many there are symbols across the city that have not been forgotten.",
      "Here are some of them:",
      "In 1985's predigital world, one image from the earthquake became seared into public memory: the sign of the luxurious Hotel Regis crowning the pile of rubble that the early 20th-century building \u2014 a center of political, artistic and social life \u2013 was reduced to.",
      "Today, vendors\u2019 stalls cover the area where its grand pillars once stood, a site dubbed Solidarity Plaza in honor of the thousands of average people who came out that day to help.",
      "A red cloud grew before the eyes of the young accounting student, Enrique Linares, now 62. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what it was,\u201d he recalled. People were running down the street, doctors with white lab coats chalked with red dust. Linares looked up at the void where the 12-story tower with a red light on top should have stood. It was then that he began to shake and realized that the hospital had collapsed.",
      "The search for survivors went on for days with soldiers controlling access to the site. After about a week, the effort was rewarded: several recently born infants were rescued alive from the rubble. They were dubbed the \u201cmiracle babies,\u201d even inspiring a television series about them.",

      "First came the screams from the seamstresses buried under one of the capital\u2019s collapsed textile plants, recalled Gloria Juandiego, now 65. Soon after, the screams were from people like her outside the rubble, who shouted that others were trapped inside. The soldiers did nothing, she said.",
      "\u201cThe bosses got the equipment out, the raw materials, their safe boxes, they prioritized that,\u201d she said. They didn\u2019t let them tear up the salvaged clothing to make tourniquets. Then came the smell and the image of how \u201cthe bodies were tossed into trucks, even as more and more women came out to demand authorities rescue their colleagues. In the end, hundreds of seamstresses, normally holed up working 12-hour days without breaks, died.",
      "\u201cOur submission was buried under the rubble,\u201d a popular sign at the time read. It was the start of the Sept. 19 seamstress union to fight for decent working conditions.",
      "And yet, on Sept. 19, 2017, another earthquake trapped textile workers laboring in similar conditions with heavy machinery in a poorly constructed building. The only difference was that this time the victims were immigrants.",
      "\u201cWe were digging with sardine cans and our hands,\u201d recalled Francisco Camacho, now 66. In 1985, he was one of the young people looking for survivors of a collapsed apartment building on Tlatelolco Plaza, where today a sun dial marks the time of the earthquake.",
      "A woman organized a chain of volunteers removing buckets full of debris. Children brought water. Camacho recalled the tenor Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, who was also helping, saying the volunteers were making holes and crawling into them \u201cas if they were moles.\"",
      "And so a volunteer rescue group known as \u201cLos Topos\u201d (The moles) was born. The organization has grown from 20-some amateurs to a diverse force of some 1,200 people today. Now, a powerful symbol of Mexican solidarity, they have traveled to 32 countries to assist at times of catastrophe. They continue training every Sunday for what could happen next.",
      "Camacho, now director of \u201cLos Topos,\u201d said pride in his work is matched by the indelible memory of having to place \u201cmany decomposing\u201d bodies in the capital\u2019s baseball stadium in 1985, an experience that left the smell of death \u201cimpregnating my nose for months.\"",

      "The Cabinet, which includes several non-politicians, is expected to take office next week after taking an oath in front of King Maha Vajiralongkorn.",
      "Anutin, head of the Bhumjaithai Party, was elected premier by Parliament last month. He succeeded Pheu Thai Party's Paetongtarn Shinawatra, who was dismissed after being found guilty of ethics violations over a politically compromising phone call with neighboring Cambodia\u2019s Senate President Hun Sen. The call was followed by a border clash between Thailand and Cambodia in July, which killed dozens.",
      "Most of Anutin\u2019s Cabinet positions went to members from his party and two other parties, Klatham and the military-backed Phalang Pracharath, which make up the main part of his minority coalition government. Many of the newly appointed ministers, including Anutin himself, had served in the Pheu Thai-led Cabinet after the 2023 general elections.",
      "The Pheu Thai Party holds no position in the current Cabinet. It had previously said it would become an opposition party.",
      "Anutin will serve as both prime minister and interior minister. He held the latter position under Paetongtarn\u2019s government.",

      "Several non-politicians nabbed ministerial positions, including Ekniti Nitithanprapas, a former Director-General of the Revenue Department, who has economics degree from the U.S., was appointed to both deputy prime minister and finance minister positions. Suphajee Suthumpun, a former CEO of major Thai hotel business Dusit Thani, will serve as commerce minister.",
      "Veteran diplomat Sihasak Phuangketkeow was appointed as foreign minister. He had served in many posts in the foreign ministry, including as its permanent secretary, vice minister and spokesperson. He was also a former Permanent Representative of Thailand to the United Nations Office in Geneva, and was chosen as President of the UN Human Rights Council in 2010.",
      "Anutin was able to secure the prime minister position after appealing to the People\u2019s Party, the country\u2019s main opposition party, by promising to dissolve Parliament within four months and organize a referendum to draft a new constitution by an elected constituent assembly.",
      "The People\u2019s Party runs on progressive platforms and has long sought changes to the constitution, imposed during a military government, saying they want to make it more democratic.",

      "Southern India\u2019s Bengaluru city, sometimes called India\u2019s Silicon Valley because of the large number of tech companies that are based here, was home to 250 lakes in the 1960s, which by some estimates have now reduced to roughly 180, primarily due to en...",
      "BENGALURU, India -- Sunil Kumar rowed his small boat, moving a few feet at a time, while he spread a fishing net across the weeds floating like a green carpet on Doddajala Lake. The ends of the net were then carried ashore and tied to a tractor and an earthmover, which pulled the bundled plants toward laborers ready to drag them out with pitchforks.",
      "Once each netful of weeds was scooped out, they repeated the process. Kumar, a fisherman who grew up nearby, and the others have been working 10 hours a day for two weeks to clean this water as part of a wider effort to restore polluted lakes that are in danger of disappearing around Bengaluru, India's fast-growing tech hub.",
      "\u201cOnce the weed grows, all fish die. This is because the weed cuts out oxygen flow below the water and, of course, nothing can survive in the water after that,\u201d he said.",
      "City authorities and volunteers have cleaned and restored dozens of lakes in recent years, but much work remains. Bengaluru had more than 250 lakes in the 1970s. Today, roughly 180 remain and many are in a poor state. Water experts said the city\u2019s explosive growth and mismanagement of sewage have severely damaged a centuries-old network of cascading lakes that sustained communities in this otherwise dry plateau.",
      "Doddajala Lake, a 94-acre (38 hectares) body of water, sits along the city's northern outskirts near its airport in an area where multistory residential buildings, resorts and offices are interspersed with older mud-tiled houses and farmland. R. Byregowda, the head of the nearby Doddajala village, attributed the growth to the area's proximity to the airport.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t imagine the kind of changes in my village in just the last five years,\u201d said Byregowda, who's been helping with the lake cleanup effort.",
      "The lake cleaning is a joint effort by citizen groups focused on weed removal and local government officials who built a walking path with benches and planted trees with help from private donors.",
      "Kumar, who has helped clean four other lakes, said rampant growth of weeds fed by nitrogen and phosphorous from sewage can be disastrous for the lake and its fish. Entangled in the weeds and on lake shores, the volunteers also encounter plastic bottles, clothes and other garbage.",
      "\u201cWhen I was a child, the water in the lake was clean and we used to swim in it, but now it\u2019s mixed with sewage water,\u201d Kumar said.",
      "The lakes' health can have wide-ranging implications for a region facing weather extremes amid a warming climate. Experts and advocates say long-term planning is needed to ensure the lakes can defend against flooding by collecting excess rainwater and bolster the city's water supply by gradually releasing their contents into groundwater sources. The lakes can also keep surrounding areas cooler in the summer.",
      "\u201cLakes can act as cooling zones during extreme heat events, and they can act as a flood buffer when there are extreme rainfall events,\u201d said Shashank Palur, a Bengaluru-based hydrologist with the think tank Water, Environment, Land and Livelihood Labs.",
      "The series of lakes and reservoirs were developed in the 16th century to support fishing, agriculture and domestic use in an otherwise dry region. The cascading system connected by water channels and stormwater drains conformed to natural valleys. Palur noted that the city has no major river running through its boundaries to feed it.",
      "As the region urbanized in recent decades, many rain-fed lakes, which were dry in the summer months, were built over. Meanwhile, poorly built or maintained sewage pipes or new buildings without proper connections caused leaks that resulted in sewage water being swept into stormwater drains. When this reaches the lakes, it spurs algal blooms and invasive weeds.",
      "A 2017 study by the Bengaluru-based Indian Institute of Science, the latest such data available, found that 85% of Bengaluru\u2019s water bodies are polluted.",
      "Palur said city officials are often playing \u201ccatch-up\u201d as newer homes and offices are occupied before sewer connections are installed, resulting in sewage being stored locally and then illegally dumped into lakes or stormwater drains.",
      "\u201cSewer connections and water supply connections haven\u2019t reached the entire city. So, lakes become polluted,\u201d he said.",

      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom has signed a bill extending the state's cap-and-trade program through 2045",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday extended a signature state program aimed at reducing planet-warming emissions through 2045, a move Democrats cheered but Republicans warned would raise gas prices.",
      "The program known as cap and trade sets a declining limit on total greenhouse gas emissions in the state from major polluters. Companies must reduce their emissions, buy allowances from the state or other businesses, or fund projects aimed at offsetting their pollution. Money the state receives from the sales funds climate-change mitigation, affordable housing and transportation projects, as well as utility bill credits for Californians.",
      "It was set to expire after 2030. The law Newsom signed Friday at the Morrison Planetarium in San Francisco potentially boosts carbon-removal projects and requires the program to align with California's target of achieving so-called carbon neutrality by 2045. That means the state will remove as many carbon emissions as it releases. The law changes the name to \u201ccap and invest\u201d to emphasize that the money goes toward other programs.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doubling down on our best tool to combat Trump\u2019s assaults on clean air \u2014 Cap-and-Invest \u2014 by making polluters pay for projects that support our most impacted communities,\u201d Newsom, a Democrat, said in a statement.",
      "Newsom also signed a law committing $1 billion in program revenue for the state\u2019s long-delayed high-speed rail project, $800 million for an affordable housing program, $250 million for community air protection programs and $1 billion for the Legislature to decide on annually.",
      "He approved other measures aimed at advancing the state\u2019s energy transition and lowering costs for Californians. They include laws to speed up permitting for oil production in Kern County, refill a fund that covers the cost of wildfire damage when utility equipment sparks a blaze and allow the state\u2019s grid operator to partner with a regional group to manage power markets in western states.",
      "Newsom also signed a bill that would increase requirements for air monitoring in areas overburdened by pollution and codify a bureau within the Justice Department created in 2018 to protect communities from environmental injustices.",
      "California has some of the highest utility and gas prices in the country. Officials face increased pressure to stabilize the cost and supply of fuel amid the planned closures of two oil refineries that make up roughly 18% of the state\u2019s refining capacity, according to energy regulators.",

The program's \u201ccap\u201d applies to planet-warming emissions, not other pollutants impacting air quality. Cap and trade doesn't set emissions limits for individual facilities, meaning an industrial polluter could continue to emit the same amount of greenhouse gases over time so long as it has the right amount of credits or offsets.",
      "Other critics of the cap-and-trade extension are worried about it raising costs. The program has increased gas costs by about 26 cents per gallon, according to a February report from the Independent Emissions Market Advisory Committee, a group of experts that analyzes the program. It has played \u201ca very small role\u201d in increasing electricity prices because the state\u2019s grid isn\u2019t very carbon intensive, the report says.",

Tony Strickland said in a statement. \u201cTheir idea of tackling affordability is extending the Cap-and-Trade program, a hidden tax that drives up costs on everything from gas to groceries.

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration has moved to block a Massachusetts offshore wind farm, its latest effort to hobble an industry and technology that President Donald Trump has attacked as \u201cugly\u201d and unreliable compared to fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas.",
      "The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, or BOEM, filed a motion in federal court Thursday seeking to take back its approval of the SouthCoast Wind project\u2019s \u201cconstruction and operations plan.'' The plan is the last major federal permit the project needs before it can start putting turbines in the water.",
      "SouthCoast Wind, to be built in federal waters about 23 miles south of Nantucket, is expected to construct as many as 141 turbines to power about 840,000 homes in Massachusetts and Rhode Island.",
      "The Interior Department action is the latest by the Trump administration in what critics call an \"all-out assault\u201d on the wind energy industry.",
      "Trump's administration has stopped construction on major offshore wind farms, revoked wind energy permits and paused permitting, canceled plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopped $679 million in federal funding for a dozen offshore wind projects.",
      "The moves are a complete reversal from the Biden administration, which approved construction of 11 large offshore wind projects to generate enough clean energy to power more than 6 million homes. The projects now face uncertain futures under Trump.",
      "Last week, the Interior Department asked a federal judge in Baltimore to cancel a previous approval by BOEM to build an offshore wind project in Maryland. The ocean agency has concluded that its prior weighing of the project's impacts was \u201cdeficient\u201d and intends to reconsider that analysis to make a new decision, the department said.",
      "Developer U.S. Wind has not yet begun construction, but plans for the Maryland Offshore Wind Project call for up to 114 turbines to power more than 718,000 homes.",
      "BOEM had approved SouthCoast\u2019s operations plan on Jan. 17, 2025, three days before Trump\u2019s second term began.",
      "\u201cBased on its review to date, BOEM has determined that the COP approval may not have fully complied with the law\" and \"may have failed to account for all the impacts that the SouthCoast Wind Project may cause,\" Interior said in its legal filing. The agency asked a federal judge to allow reconsideration of the project.",
      "In a statement, developer Ocean Winds said the company \u201cintends to vigorously defend our permits in federal court.\u201d",

      "Pulling energy project permits and canceling lease sales isn't new. Biden revoked the permit to build the long-disputed Keystone XL oil pipeline on his first day in office, halting construction. He canceled scheduled oil and gas lease sales.",
      "But Trump's efforts to dismantle the offshore wind industry are much more extensive than the way Biden targeted fossil fuels, said Kristoffer Svendsen, assistant dean for energy law at the George Washington University Law School. He thinks offshore wind developers will now see the U.S. as too risky.",
      "\u201cThey have plenty of options. They can invest in Europe and Asia. There are good markets to invest in offshore wind. It's just the U.S. is not a good market to invest in,\u201d he said.",
      "The Trump administration has stopped construction on two major offshore wind farms, so far. One of them, the Empire Wind project for New York, was allowed to resume construction. The Revolution Wind project for Rhode Island and Connecticut is paused, and both the developer and the two states sued in federal courts.",
      "The Danish energy company Orsted is building Revolution Wind. The Danish government owns a majority stake in the company.",

      "Nelson is now 92,Young is 79 and Mellencamp is 73, but they're still going strong. Organizers announced Wednesday that Minnesota native Bob Dylan will be joining them. Others taking the stage at the University of Minnesota's football stadium will include Dave Matthews,Margo Price,Kenny Chesney,Wynonna Judd, and Nathaniel Rateliff.",
      "This year\u2019s concert comes at a worrying time for American farmers. Farm profitability has been falling. Crop prices are low while production costs are rising. And the Trump administration\u2019s trade wars have added to the insecurity. China has not bought any of the 2025 U.S. soybean crop so far and has turned to America's competitors, such as Brazil, to meet its needs.",
      "A labor dispute nearly derailed the festival this year. Organizers said they would not cross the picket lines of striking teamster service workers at the university, saying \u201cthe farm and labor movements are inseparable.\u201d Nelson got on the phone with Gov. Tim Walz. The university and union reached a deal late last week.",
      "\u201cThe Governor knows how important this event is to farmers and farm country,\u201d Walz spokesperson Claire Lancaster said. \u201cHe worked with all parties involved, including Willie Nelson, to find a solution.\u201d",
      "Farm Aid is thrilled that the show will go on.",
      "\u201cFor four decades, Farm Aid has stood with farmers and workers,\u201d organizers said in a statement that called the agreement \u201ca reminder of what can be achieved when people come together in the spirit of fairness and solidarity.\u201d",

CNN will also stream it live on CNN.com, and on its apps without requiring a cable login. Sirius XM will carry it on satellite radio starting at noon CDT. Beginning at 11:30 a.m. CDT, it will also stream on the nugs live music platform and YouTube channel, and at FarmAid.org and on Farm Aid's YouTube channel.",

      "\u201cI grew up in rural Missouri, and grew up with agriculture around me, and we didn\u2019t have much money as a family,\u201d Rateliff recalled in an interview. \u201cSo we had a huge one-acre garden, and my mom canned a lot of stuff, and my dad and I would hunt squirrel and rabbit and deer and whatever else we could eat.\u201d",

But he said music bridges political differences. He said his own fans include people who voted for Bernie Sanders, a self-named democratic socialist, and for President Donald Trump.",

      "A National Transportation Safety Board report last year determined the probable cause of the crash was inadequate inspections, resulting in an eventual loosening of hardware and subsequent loss of helicopter control. A post-crash examination of the flight controls showed hardware that should have been connected to a part on the main rotor was disconnected and the connecting hardware was missing, the final NTSB report says.",

      "It would be the second call with Xi since Trump returned to the White House and launched sky-high tariffs on China, triggering back-and-forth trade restrictions that strained ties between the two largest economies.

      "NEW YORK -- When we make mistakes at work, it can lead to a cycle of negative thinking.",
      "The damaging thoughts swirl: \u201cI\u2019m an impostor.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not smart enough.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m failing at my job.\u201d",
      "Feeling like an impostor \u2014 doubting one\u2019s own abilities despite a track record of success \u2014 is common, especially among women and members of marginalized groups. Even on days when everything\u2019s going right, it can be hard to shift out of a cycle of self-doubt.",
      "But there are ways to interrupt that downward spiral.",
      "Many people have found cognitive behavioral therapy, a form of talk therapy, helpful to examine internal monologues such as \u201cI\u2019m going to say the wrong thing\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not good enough\u201d \u2014 and replace them with neutral or positive mantras.",
      "\u201cWhat we do in cognitive behavior therapy is help people identify these negative thoughts, and then we teach them to evaluate those thoughts and see how accurate they are,\u201d said Judith Beck, president of the Beck Institute for Cognitive Behavior Therapy, based in Pennsylvania.",
      "\u201cIf they\u2019re not accurate, we discuss what\u2019s a more realistic perspective on this,\u201d she said.",
      "To reach students with social, emotional and behavioral challenges, Randolph Public Schools, a district outside of Boston, held a recent seminar about helping children reframe their negative feelings using cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT.",
      "\u201cWe want our students\u2026 to really have the mindset that they can do things confidently,\u201d said Alpha Sanford, chief of development and student services, who started the initiative.",
      "During the training, Christin Brink, an assistant principal for special education, thought to herself, \u201cWow, I need this just as much as the kids do.\u201d",
      "\u201cBeing a younger administrator in this role, it\u2019s something new to me,\u201d Brink added. \u201cA lot of times I\u2019ll have impostor syndrome, and I\u2019ll make a choice that I later regret.\u201d",
      "If you find yourself having negative thoughts frequently, you\u2019re not alone. There are evolutionary reasons for it.",
      "\u201cWhen we were cavemen, it was very important for us to be alert for danger,\u201d Beck said. Preparing for the worst possible outcome helped people stay alive. Some worries \u2014 such as \u201cI don\u2019t have enough time to complete this project\u201d \u2014 can motivate people to get things done, she said.",
      "But lingering on what\u2019s going wrong can be unhealthy. We sometimes filter out positive reinforcement, downplaying recognition we\u2019ve received and overemphasizing mistakes, said Kristene Doyle, director of the Albert Ellis Institute, a psychotherapy training organization based in New York.",
      "Practicing your positive beliefs by saying them to yourself with force, vigor and frequency can help you build a healthier thinking muscle, she said.",

      "\u201cTelling myself \u2018I\u2019m not good enough to be here\u2019 is only going to lead me down a path of a self-fulfilling prophecy, and you make that worst-case scenario happen,\u201d Doyle said. \u201cWhat makes somebody good enough to be in the room? What makes somebody good enough to have a job?\u201d",

      "Now, instead of jumping to the worst conclusion, she pauses to examine the thought. \u201cWhat did they actually say to you?\u201d she asks herself. \u201cDid they say the actual words, \u2018You\u2019re terrible?\u2019 Did they actually say, \u2018You have to throw out the whole lesson?\u2019\u201d",

      "Some therapists get creative when working with clients to identify negative feelings or beliefs. Avigail Lev, a psychologist with the Bay Area CBT Center in San Francisco, has clients write down the phrases, such as \u201cThey don\u2019t value the work that I\u2019m doing\u201d or \u201cI haven\u2019t done enough to get a raise.\u201d",

      "It can take time and practice to successfully reframe negative thoughts that have been replaying in our mind for years. When Renee Baker was studying architecture in college, professors and instructors frequently tore into her work. The critiques were designed to thicken her skin. But they had a lasting impact.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s the self-doubt that comes with being told, literally, \u2018You\u2019re not good enough. Your ideas aren\u2019t good enough. Your work isn\u2019t good enough,\u2019\u201d said Baker, who\u2019s now director of project management at Inform Studio, a design firm. \u201cAt the heart of a lot of my self-doubt is feeling like my voice, and what I think, what I believe, what I am passionate about, isn\u2019t as important as the next person's.\u201d",
      "So Baker worked with a therapist to challenge her damaging core beliefs, exchanging them for more neutral thoughts. At work, she practiced speaking up even when her throat felt tight with anxiety. Over time, she became less anxious and more comfortable sharing her ideas.",
      "You can get specific when you're searching for alternative, healthier mantras.",
      "\u201cWhen we look at this sentence, \u2018They don\u2019t value the work that I\u2019m doing,\u2019 do you have any examples of when you felt your work was valued? Do you have examples of when people appreciated your work?\u201d Lev asked.",
      "You can also reframe your thoughts about other people who are part of your workday.",
      "Eleanor Forbes, a social worker in Randolph Public Schools, helps teachers and administrators learn to apply CBT techniques. When staff members complain that a young person is being manipulative, she helps them reframe the thought. \u201cHow about we just say that this young person is just using survival skills?\u201d she said.",
      "Brink, the assistant principal, learned to reframe her own negative thoughts, saying to herself: \u201cI made a lot of great choices today,\u201d or \u201cThis was what went well,\u201d and \u201cTomorrow we can try again with x, y and z.\u201d",

      "The Federal Reserve just cut its benchmark rate for the first time since last year, but that doesn't guarantee mortgage rates will keep dropping",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Hoping that mortgage rates will keep dropping following the Federal Reserve's first rate cut since last year? Don't bank on it.",
      "As expected, the central bank delivered a quarter-point cut Wednesday and projected it would lower its benchmark rate twice more this year, reflecting growing concern over the U.S. job market.",
      "Here's a look at factors that determine mortgage rates and what the Fed's latest move means for the housing market:",
      "Mortgage rates have been mostly falling since late July on expectations of a Fed rate cut. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage was at 6.35% last week, its lowest level in nearly a year, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac.",
      "A similar pullback in mortgage rates happened around this time last year in the weeks leading up to the Fed\u2019s first rate cut in more than four years. Back then, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage got down to a 2-year low of 6.08% one week after the central bank cut rates.",
      "But it hasn't come close to that since.",
      "Mortgage rates didn't keep falling last year, even as the Fed cut its main rate two more times. Instead, mortgage rates rose and kept climbing until the average rate on a 30-year home loan reached just over 7% by mid-January.",
      "Like last year, the Fed's rate cut doesn't necessarily mean mortgage rates will keep declining, even as the central bank signals more cuts ahead.",
      "\u201cRates could come down further, as the Fed has signaled the potential for two more rate cuts this year,\u201d said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS. \u201cHowever, there are still risks of a reversal in mortgage rates. Inflation heated up in August and if the September inflation report shows another bump in consumer prices, it\u2019s possible we could see rates rise.\u201d",
      "No. Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Fed's interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors\u2019 expectations for the economy and inflation.",
      "Mortgage rates generally follow the trajectory of the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.",
      "That's because mortgages are typically bundled into mortgage-backed securities that are sold to investors. To keep mortgage-backed securities attractive to investors, their yield \u2014 or annual return -- is adjusted to be competitive with the yield offered by the U.S. on its 10-year government bonds.

      "\u201cIt's not just about what the Fed is doing today, it\u2019s about what they\u2019re expected to do in the future, and that\u2019s determined by things like economic growth, what\u2019s going to happen in the labor market and what do we think inflation is going to be like over the next year or so,\u201d said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\u201cIf the Fed keeps lowering rates, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean mortgages will go down,\u201d said Stephen Kates, financial analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIt means that they probably could go down more, and they may trend in that direction, even if they don\u2019t move in lockstep.\u201d",
      "Ahead of the Fed's rate cut, the futures market had priced in expectations that the central bank would cut its key interest rate at upcoming policy meetings this year and into 2026. But the Fed's latest projections show a less aggressive path of rate cuts than the market has been expecting.",
      "\u201cThis ongoing gap between market and Fed expectations means that some risk of upward pressure on mortgage rates remains,\u201d said Hale, adding that the decline in mortgage rates \u201cis likely to continue at least through this week.\"",
      "Hale recently forecast that the average rate on a 30-year mortgage will be between 6.3% and 6.4% by the end of this year. That's in line with recent projections by other economists who also don't expect the average rate to drop below 6% this year.",
      "The late-summer pullback in mortgage rates has been a welcome trend for the housing market, which has been in a slump since 2022, when mortgage rates began climbing from historic lows. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes sank last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years and have remained sluggish so far this year.",
      "While lower rates give home shoppers more purchasing power, mortgage rates remain too high for many Americans to afford to buy a home. That\u2019s mostly because home prices, while rising more slowly than in years past, are still up by roughly 50% nationally since the start of this decade.",
      "\u201cWhile lower rates will bring some buyers and sellers into the market, today\u2019s cut will not be enough to break up the housing market logjam,\u201d said Sturtevant. \"We will need to see further drops in mortgage rates and much slower home price growth, or even home price declines, to make a dent in affordability.\u201d",
      "If mortgage rates continue to ease, home shoppers will benefit from more affordable financing. But lower mortgage rates could also bring in more buyers, making the market more competitive at a time when sellers across the country are having a tougher time driving a hard bargain.",
      "Predicting when mortgage rates will decline and by how much is daunting because so many variables can influence their trajectory from one week to the next.",
      "Home shoppers who can afford to buy at current rates may be better off buying now if they find a property that fits their needs, rather than attempt to time the market, said Kates.",
      "Many homeowners looking to refinance have already seized on the decline in rates, sending applications for refinance loans sharply higher in recent weeks.",
      "One rule of thumb to consider when refinancing is whether you can reduce your current rate by at least one percentage point, which helps blunt the impact of refinancing fees.",

      "The swap is part of a larger movement across the country to share resources with neighbors \u2014 one shirt, meal or book at time.",
      "The Portland event asks for a $10 entry fee to cover costs, but the clothes are free and there\u2019s no limit to how much participants can take. People bring their gently used clothing, shoes and accessories to a sorting station, where volunteers sort it into bins and onto tables.",
      "Ridgway, who worked in the apparel industry, sees the process as an answer to throwaway \u201cfast fashion.\u201d She describes \u201cthe \u2018peak pile\u2019 moment, when our sorters are summiting a mountain, a literal tonnage of apparel, sorting as quickly as they can. In this moment, we see the true ramifications of consumer culture and waste.\u201d",
      "Leftover clothing is donated to another free neighborhood swapping event.",
      "Ridgway recalls a single mom telling her she was able to outfit her teenager with Nike shoes and other major brands typically outside her price range. \u201cThese conversations, and so many others, have truly kept me coming back to this event,\u201d she says.",
      "There are no dressing rooms, so participants are encouraged to come in tight-fitting clothes and try things on where they are.",

      "Scott hopped on Instagram to see if her friends wanted to help, and quickly received an offer of a fridge and a promise to paint it. Several months and planning calls later, she opened her first community fridge outside a cafe, in January 2021.",

      "Protesters are hitting France with transport strikes, demonstrations and blockades, targeting the Paris Metro and other sectors",
      "PARIS -- Protesters hit France with transport strikes, notably hobbling the Paris Metro, demonstrations and traffic slowdowns and blockades Thursday, pitting the power of the streets against President Emmanuel Macron 's government and its proposals to cut funding for public services that underpin the French way of life.",
      "The first whiffs of police teargas came before daybreak, with scuffles between riot officers and protesters in Paris. Nationwide demonstrations, from France's biggest cities to small towns, were expected to mobilize hundreds of thousands of marchers, voicing anger about mounting poverty, sharpening inequality and struggles for low-paid workers and others to make ends meet.",
      "\u201cWe say \u2018no\u2019 to the government. We\u2019ve had enough. There\u2019s no more money, a high cost of living,\" striking transport worker Nadia Belhoum said at a before-dawn protest targeting a Paris bus depot. She described \u201cpeople agonizing, being squeezed like a lemon even if there\u2019s no more juice.\u201d",
      "Labor unions that called strikes are pushing for the abandonment of proposed budget cuts, social welfare freezes and other belt-tightening that opponents contend will further hit the pockets of low-paid and middle-class workers and which triggered the collapse of successive governments that sought to push through savings.",
      "Opponents of Macron's business-friendly leadership complain that taxpayer-funded public services \u2014 free schools and public hospitals, subsidized health care, unemployment benefits and other safety nets that are cherished in France \u2014 are being eroded. Left-wing parties and their supporters want the wealthy and businesses to pay more, rather than see spending cuts to plug holes in France's finances and to rein in its debts.",
      "\u201cPublic service is falling apart,\u201d said teacher Claudia Nunez. \u201cIt\u2019s always the same people who pay.\u201d",
      "The day of upheaval \u2014 with strikes also impacting schools, industry and other sectors of the European Union\u2019s second-largest economy \u2014 aimed to turn up the heat on new Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu. Macron appointed him last week, tasking Lecornu with building parliamentary support for belt-tightening that brought down his predecessors.",
      "\u201cBringing in Lecornu doesn\u2019t change anything \u2014 he\u2019s just another man in a suit who will follow Macron\u2019s line,\u201d said 22-year-old student Juliette Martin.",
      "\u201cWe want our voices heard. People my age feel like no one in politics is speaking for us,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s always our generation that ends up with the insecurity and the debt.\u201d",
      "Unions have decried budget proposals by Macron's minority governments, weakened by their lack of a dependable majority in parliament, as brutal and punitive for workers, retirees and others who are vulnerable.",
      "\u201cThe bourgeoisie of this country have been gorging themselves, they don\u2019t even know what to do with their money anymore. So if there is indeed a crisis, the question is who should pay for it,\u201d said Fabien Villedieu, a leader of the SUD-Rail train workers union. \u201cWe are asking that the government\u2019s austerity plan that consists of making the poorest in this country always pay \u2014 whether they are employees, retirees, students \u2014 ends and that we make the richest in this country pay.\u201d",
      "Striking rail workers waving flares made a brief foray into the Paris headquarters of the Economics Ministry, leaving trails of smoke in the air before leaving.",
      "Macron's opponents also continue to denounce unpopular pension reforms that he railroaded through parliament and which raised the minimum retirement age from 62 to 64, triggering a firestorm of anger and rounds of protest earlier in what is his second and last term as president, which ends in 2027.",

And Lecornu \u2014 he\u2019s only just started, but if this is his idea of stability, then he has a long way to go.

      "TSOKOMEY, Ghana -- Beatrice Nutekpor weaves through the mangroves in Tsokomey community, just outside of Ghana\u2019s capital of Accra, every day to harvest oysters for sale. It\u2019s a family tradition she\u2019s been doing since she was 15. Now 45, she is struggling to sustain the practice and pass it to her daughter.",
      "In Ghana\u2019s coastal mangroves, oyster farming has been a key source of livelihood dominated for ages by women. Hundreds of women were trained in eco-friendly farming methods for oysters, including mangrove planting and preservation, and selective oyster harvesting, to lessen the impact of climate change.",
      "Mangroves, trees or shrubs that grow along coastlines serve a critical multifunctional purpose in the aquatic ecosystem, ranging from being a home to fish to providing a buffer for coastal erosion from rising sea levels, and protection to land during storms and cyclones.",
      "However, training by the Development Action Association nonprofit has ended after it lost its U.S. aid as a result of U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to cut foreign aid contracts. It left the women to try what they can to keep their generational practice and sustain their families as Ghana emerges from its worst economic crisis in a decades.",
      "Their efforts to protect the mangroves from encroachment and preserve them for a longer period of up to six months are gradually paying off. \u201cThe oysters have started attaching themselves to the mangroves we have planted,\u201d Nutekpor says.",
      "Oyster farming involves breeding oysters in a controlled aquatic environment for commercial purposes.",
      "Much like the rest of coastal West African nations, Ghana has lost a significant portion of its mangroves to climate change and development. There is no available data on recent depletion, but over 80% of the original mangroves have been lost since the last century.",
      "Mangroves are also increasingly threatened by climate change as global temperatures and sea levels rise.",
      "A single basin of oysters sells for roughly 47 Ghanaian cedis ($4), and Nutekpor sells just enough to feed her family and put her daughters through school.",
      "As mangroves are depleted by people in search of firewood, development has crept into the coastal areas and authorities release water from overflowing dams, endangering the forests. Nutekpor\u2019s worst nightmare is already manifesting: This year saw less oysters compared to last year, according to Lydia Sasu, the executive director of the Development Action Association.",
      "For farmers like Nutekpor, the loss of mangroves means risking drowning by free diving 30 feet (9 meters) or deeper for hours, in search of oysters that migrate to deeper water in the absence of mangrove roots.",
      "\u201cWhen you have a situation where the water body, which is already dynamic, becomes more dynamic than before, the oysters cannot grow,\u201d said Francis Nunoo, a professor of fisheries science at the University of Ghana.",
      "Although replanting the mangroves have paid off for the women, it is a back-breaking job that keeps them in the harsh sun for hours.",

      "The Federal Reserve is expected to cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time in nine months",
      "NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve is expected to cut its benchmark interest rate Wednesday for the first time in nine months. Since the last cut, progress on inflation has slowed while the labor market has cooled. That means Americans are dealing with both high prices and a challenging job market.",
      "The federal funds rate, set by the Federal Reserve, is the rate at which banks borrow and lend to one another. While the rates that consumers pay to borrow money aren\u2019t directly linked to this rate, shifts in Fed policy affect what people pay for credit cards, auto loans, mortgages, and other financial products.",
      "The Fed has two goals when it sets the rate: one, to manage prices for goods and services, and two, to encourage full employment. This is known as the \u201cdual mandate.\u201d Typically, the Fed might increase the rate to try to bring down inflation and decrease it to encourage faster economic growth and more hiring. The challenge now is that inflation is higher than the Fed's 2% target but the job market is weak, putting the Fed in a difficult position.",
      "\u201cThe dual mandate is always a balancing act,\" said Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at personal finance site NerdWallet.",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "For prospective homebuyers, the market has already priced in the rate cut, which means it's \u201cunlikely to make a noticeable difference for most consumers at the time of the announcement,\u201d according to Bankrate financial analyst Stephen Kates.",
      "\u201cMuch of the impact on mortgage rates has already occurred through anticipation alone,\u201d he said. \"(Mortgage) rates have been falling since January and dropped further as weaker-than-expected economic data pointed to a cooling economy.\u201d",
      "Still, Kates said a declining interest rate environment will provide some relief for borrowers over time.",
      "\u201cWhether it\u2019s a homeowner with a 7% mortgage or a recent graduate hoping to refinance student loans and credit card debt, lower rates can ease the burden on many indebted households by opening opportunities to refinance or consolidate,\u201d he said.",
      "For savers, falling interest rates will slowly erode attractive yields currently on offer with certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts.",
      "Right now, the best rates on offer for each have been hovering at or above 4% for CDs and at 4.6% for high-yield savings accounts, according to DepositAccounts.com.",
      "Those are still better than the trends of recent years, and a good option for consumers who want to earn a return on money they may want to access in the near-term. A high-yield savings account generally has a much higher annual percentage yield than a traditional savings account. The national average for traditional savings accounts is currently 0.38%.",

      "Americans have faced steeper auto loan rates over the last three years after the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate starting in early 2022. Those are not expected to decline any time soon. While a cut will contribute to eventual relief, it might be slow in arriving, analysts say.",
      "\u201cIf the auto market starts to freeze up and people aren\u2019t buying cars, then we may see lending margins start to shrink, but auto loan rates don\u2019t move in lockstep with the Fed rate,\u201d said Bankrate analyst Stephen Kates.",
      "Prices for new cars have leveled off recently, but remain at historically high levels, not adjusting for inflation.",
      "Generally speaking, an auto loan annual percentage rate can run from about 4% to 30%. Bankrate\u2019s most recent weekly survey found that average auto loan interest rates are currently at 7.19% on a 60-month new car loan.",
      "Interest rates for credit cards are currently at an average of 20.13%, and the Fed's rate cut may be slow to be felt by anyone carrying a large amount of credit card debt. That said, any reduction is positive news.",
      "\u201cWhile the broader impact of a rate reduction on consumers\u2019 financial health remains to be fully seen, it could offer some relief from the persistent budgetary pressures driven by inflation,\u201d said Michele Raneri, vice president and head of U.S. research at credit reporting agency TransUnion.",
      "\u201cThese savings could contribute to a reduction in delinquency rates across credit card and unsecured personal loan segments,\u201d she said.",

      "Votes are expected Thursday afternoon on hepatitis B and on a combined shot against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox, but Department of Health and Human Services officials have not said exactly what proposals would be considered.",
      "Information on the meeting agenda suggests the committee may be poised to roll back \u2014 at least partly \u2014 a longstanding recommendation that all U.S. children get an initial dose of hepatitis B vaccine right after birth.",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t understand the rationale of why we would stop providing that vaccine and that guidance to babies when we\u2019ve seen such great progress in that area,\" said Roberts, who was scheduled to join the vaccine panel but was dismissed by Kennedy. \u201cIf it's not broken, why change it?\u201d",
      "The committee's chair, Martin Kulldorff, also has raised the idea of recommending the MMRV combination shot not be given to children younger than 4. In a June presentation to the committee, he discussed rare instances of feverish seizures that have been associated with the first dose, given to kids between ages 1 and 2.",
      "The ACIP last dealt with the issue in 2009, when it said either the combination shot or separate MMR and varicella shots were acceptable for the first dose. Today, most pediatricians suggest separate doses for the first round and give the combined shot for the second dose, pediatrics experts say.",
      "Some doctors and public health experts say they are not aware of any new safety data that would explain the revisiting of those vaccination recommendations. They worry that the panel is raising unwarranted new questions about vaccines in the minds of parents, and that it may limit the ability of families to get their children protected.",
      "The panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, makes recommendations to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on how already-approved vaccines should be used. CDC directors have almost always accepted those recommendations, which are widely heeded by doctors and guide vaccination programs.",
      "Kennedy, a leading antivaccine activist before becoming the nation\u2019s top health official, fired the entire 17-member panel earlier this year and replaced it with a group that includes several anti-vaccine voices. On Monday, HHS announced the addition of five more people, some of them noted skeptics of COVID-19 vaccinations or pandemic prevention measures.",

      "NEW YORK -- The Platinum Card is getting shinier and pricier.",
      "American Express' latest update to its high-end Platinum Card, unveiled Thursday, comes with a lot more perks, including a $400 credit for dining out, and a lofty annual fee of $895.",
      "The Platinum Card refresh is just the latest from the major credit card issuers, and the higher fees may put pressure on some cardholders to choose between the Platinum Card or another high-fee card like Chase\u2019s Sapphire Reserve Card. Or pay close to $2,000 in annual fees for the privilege of carrying two or more of these premium cards.",
      "As part of the revamp, the Platinum Card customers will get a $600 annual hotel credit \u2014 up from $300 \u2014 to use with AmEx\u2019s travel portal; a new $400 credit for using AmEx\u2019s restaurant reservation platform Resy; $300 to use at athletic apparel chain Lululemon; and an increased \u201cdigital entertainment credit\u201d of $300 that AmEx cardmembers can put toward several streaming services or news outlets.",
      "All the new perks are available for AmEx customers to start using immediately. In all, AmEx says the value of the perks on the new Platinum Card total roughly $3,500. These perks are enough to justify the $200 increase in the annual fee, said Howard Grosfield, group president of U.S. Consumer Services at AmEx. The annual fee on the Platinum Card was $550 just five years ago.",
      "\u201cWhat we are trying to do is two things: We want to make sure we are delivering $3,500 in benefits that is far, far in excess of the $895 fee and make it easy to find multiple ways for card members to find benefits that exceed that fee,\u201d Grosfield said in an interview.",
      "None of the Platinum Card\u2019s previous perks, such as a $200 airline fee credit or the credit to shop at Saks Fifth Avenue, are going away, the company said.",
      "People who watch the credit card rewards space closely felt the upgrades were worth it.",
      "\u201cIf nothing else, going to lounges and using the $600 hotel credit will essentially justify the cost each year, and the other items are a bonus,\u201d said Ryan Smith, news managing editor of UpgradedPoints. Smith was briefed on the changes to AmEx's card before the launch.",
      "Also, as part of refresh, AmEx is issuing the stainless steel card with a high-gloss, mirrored finish, a version that may end up pulling double duty as a portable mirror.",
      "Once a niche product whose goal was to \u201csell snobbery\u201d to the high-flying business executive of the 1980s, as one magazine wrote 40 years ago, the Platinum Card is now one of American Express\u2019 most popular products, as millions of Americans have been willing to pay handsomely to play in the game of chasing airline and hotel status and perks. It is estimated that 70% to 80% of all credit cards are now tied to a loyalty programs like hotel, airline or credit card points, according to industry research and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Those programs used to be a rarity a few decades ago.",

      "JPMorgan Chase updated its Chase Sapphire Reserve Card in June, with its own $300 dining credit as well as a new $300 credit to use toward concert and event tickets through StubHub, among other perks. Citigroup released the Strata Elite Card in August. Capital One has a high-end card known as Venture X and fintech company Bilt, the company that cultivated a brand by letting renters pay their rent via credit card, is expected to have a high-end card next year.",
      "When Chase increased the rewards on its Sapphire Reserve Card in June, American Express tried to one-up its rival with a press release letting people know that upgrades to the Platinum Card were coming. The company has been teasing its Platinum Card changes on social media for several weeks.",
      "Not to be outdone by AmEx, Chase said Wednesday it was tweaking some of the rewards on Sapphire Reserve to make them more flexible for its customers, 24 hours before AmEx\u2019s announcement.",
      "AmEx continues to lean heavily on what's been joked about in the industry as the \u201ccoupon book,\u201d where customers are given major discounts for select merchants and partners, while Chase has leaned heavily on giving people bonus points for certain spending. But as part of their broad marketing campaign for the updated card, AmEx leaned heavily on its reach and useability of the benefits. For example, AmEx executives pointed out that its $400 credit on Resy is good at 10,000 restaurants, while Chase's own dining credit is good at only \u201chundreds\u201d of restaurants. AmEx also has a large airport lounge network, either through their own Centurion lounges, or its partnership with Delta Air Lines.",
      "\u201cWe've been at this premium game for a long time. I think our cardmembers see the Platinum Card as in a league of its own,\u201d Grosfield said.",

The tone in coach Stephanie White's voice changed between the first two questions of her postgame news conference. And three-time All-Star guard Kelsey Mitchell recounted her journey here, to her first WNBA semifinal appearance \u2014 the one nobody saw coming just a few weeks ago.",
      "Yes, this team defied the odds by playing their way \u2014 with grit, resilience and an uncanny ability to adapt to any obstacle that threatened to derail their postseason aspirations.",
      "\u201cI've had so many coaches in eight years, I've been on the worst record teams in the Indiana Fever (history), so I know where my career started at,\u201d Mitchell said after the sixth-seeded Fever rallied in the final minute to beat the third-seeded Dream 87-85 in a decisive Game 3. \u201cI know what I've had to go through to kind of be in this position, and I've never had a coach that poured into me respectfully, like Steph has. I've never felt that as a pro.\u201d",
      "The truth is White needed Mitchell every bit as much, maybe even more, than Mitchell needed that tight bond with the league's 2023 Coach of the Year.",
      "It wasn't supposed to go this way after general manager Amber Cox spent the offseason pulling together a strong, deep and championship-experienced supporting cast around Clark, the 2024 Rookie of the Year, to turn Indiana into a title contender.",

      "But with their playoff hopes teetering, the snakebitten Fever found an unexpected answer to that massive hole \u2014 relying on All-Star center Aliyah Boston's evolving passing game and watching Mitchell thriving as both a ball distributor and the team's top scorer at 20.2 points per game.",

In those moments, you know, I think that's good for 12 or 15 points. It just is, and you couple that with the resilience, the toughness, the grit, the fight, the scrappiness and you always give yourself a chance.\u201d",
      "They proved it by winning the league's Commissioner Cup title without Clark and again by closing the regular season with five wins in their final seven games, including each of the last three, to earn the No. 6 seed.",
      "They did it again by rebounding from an 80-68 Game 1 loss by winning two elimination games \u2014 77-60 on their home court and then back in Atlanta by scoring the final seven points, thanks in large part to five double-digit scorers and Lexie Hull's steal with 4.8 seconds to play.",
      "\u201cI'm grateful and happy to be back in the semifinals again,\u201d said Natasha Howard, who started her career in 2015 with Indiana before winning three WNBA titles and was selected the league's 2019 Defensive Player of the Year. \u201cI'm just so excited that we're back here again with this group of young women and the job is not done yet.\u201d",

      "Cincinnati Bengals star Ja'Marr Chase says he won't hesitate to break out Justin Jefferson's signature touchdown celebration if he scores in the game at Minnesota on Sunday",
      "EAGAN, Minn. -- Ja'Marr Chase was asked this week if he felt emboldened enough to use Justin Jefferson's signature touchdown celebration should he score for Cincinnati in Minnesota's stadium, and the Bengals star had no hesitation in stating his desire to taunt his Vikings counterpart.",
      "\u201cIf he doesn't want me to do it,\u201d Chase said, \u201cthen I'm going to do it now purposely.\u201d",
      "Jefferson introduced the NFL to \u201cThe Griddy\u201d as a rookie in 2020, the leg-hopping, arm-swinging, eye-circling dance he does as an ode to his home state. Chase actually picked it up first from a childhood friend and showed it to Jefferson and the rest of the team when they were together at LSU.",
      "Now they're friendly rivals of sorts, jockeying for unofficial position as the league's best pass-catcher. Their teams will meet on Sunday for just the third time, playing in opposite conferences. The Bengals won the first two games, both at home in overtime by 27-24 margins.",
      "\u201cWho knows what I\u2019ll do when I get in the end zone? Maybe I might get a fine this week. Who knows?\u201d Chase said.",
      "Over the four-plus seasons since Chase was drafted by Cincinnati with the fifth overall pick in 2021, Jefferson has the most receiving yards (6,157) in the league with Chase (5,616) three spots behind him. Jefferson has the fifth-most receptions (414), and Chase is sixth (411). Last year, Chase won the receiving triple crown by leading the NFL in catches, yards and touchdowns while joining Jefferson on the Associated Press All-Pro team. Not that sharing such an honor made much of a ripple in their relationship.",
      "\u201cI just think we\u2019re immune to it. We expect it from each other,\" Chase said. \"We\u2019ve been pushing each other for so long.\u201d",
      "With Jefferson and Chase and a whole bunch of other future pros, LSU won the College Football Playoff national championship in the 2019 season. Their quarterback, of course, was Joe Burrow, who became the first overall pick in the 2020 draft by the Bengals. Jefferson went 22nd.",
      "Burrow just had toe surgery and won't get to catch up on the field this weekend with Jefferson, leaving Chase to lead the way for backup Jake Browning. Jefferson knows all about that type of turnover, with Carson Wentz stepping in this week after J.J. McCarthy sprained his ankle. Wentz will be the seventh different quarterback to start for the Vikings in the last 30 regular-season games.",
      "Those absences will make the Chase-Jefferson competition more than just a sideshow.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always extra when you have a player like that that\u2019s top in the league just as well as I am,\u201d said Jefferson, who has just seven catches for 125 yards through two games. \u201cOf course that competitive aspect is there, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s about our team and it\u2019s about winning. So as long as those two things are done, then I'm happy leaving that building.\u201d",

Both the team and the player have made clear in this case that the weekly decisions have been collaborative and not simply a matter of the coaching and medical staffs exercising caution.",
      "Darrisaw's unorthodox stance puts his legs lower to the turf, which he acknowledged on Friday might put more stress on his knee. He said he's comfortable wearing a brace, but in the overall picture of his agility, confidence and strength he hasn't been quite there yet to declare himself back. Darrisaw said he feels like his status for the game on Sunday is truly a 50-50 situation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve just got to trust my body, really be smart with it. It\u2019s early in the year. When I\u2019m ready, I know I\u2019ll be ready, and I\u2019ll be back out there,\u201d he said.",
      "Left tackle Justin Skule and center Ryan Kelly were both ruled out with concussions, though each player returned to practice on Friday on a limited basis. If Darrisaw is again inactive, the Vikings would likely start either Blake Brandel or Walter Rouse with Bengals All-Pro defensive end Trey Hendrickson looming on the other side.",
      "The Vikings also listed safety Harrison Smith and outside linebacker Andrew Van Ginkel as questionable to play. Van Ginkel (concussion) sat out the last game. Smith has yet to play this season, working his way back from a personal health matter.",

      "Alison Lee also finished strong with a birdie and an eagle and was among those one shot behind, just what she needed to see in her third tournament back from giving birth to a son in late April.",
      "The scoring was low at Pinnacle Country Club, and that's what concerned Schmelzel. She went out in 34 and was at 2 under and seemingly going nowhere. But she knew she was coming up on some scoring holes, with short clubs into the green and two par 5s.",
      "\u201cYou should at least have looks on all those because you have pretty short clubs in,\u201d Schmelzel said. \u201cI told my caddie walking to the green on 14 I need to start making some birdies or else I'm going to get lapped out there today.\u201d",
      "She hit a few wedges close. She made a long birdie putt on the 17th. And then she capped it off with a second shot close enough for a good look at eagle. She was 2 under through 13 holes, and then 6 under over the last five.",
      "Katsu spread out her eight birdies in a bogey-free round.",

For example, Dozynki, the harvest festival celebrated in Poland and other Eastern European countries, was thought to have been originally tied to the equinox. At the Mayan site Chichen Itza in Mexico, people gather during the equinox to watch the sun create a shadow pattern that resembles a serpent descending a building called El Castillo.",

      "But what is happening in the heavens? Here\u2019s what to know about how we split up the year using the Earth\u2019s orbit.",
      "As the Earth travels around the sun, it does so at an angle.",
      "For most of the year, the Earth\u2019s axis is tilted either toward or away from the sun. That means the sun\u2019s warmth and light fall unequally on the northern and southern halves of the planet.",
      "During the equinox, the Earth\u2019s axis and its orbit align so that both hemispheres get an equal amount of sunlight.",
      "The word equinox comes from two Latin words, meaning equal and night. That\u2019s because on the equinox, day and night last almost the same amount of time \u2014 though one may get a few extra minutes, depending on where you are on the planet.",
      "The Northern Hemisphere\u2019s fall \u2014 or autumnal \u2014 equinox can land between Sept. 21 and 24, depending on the year. Its spring \u2014 or vernal \u2014 equinox can land between March 19 and 21.",

      "The approval of a high seas treaty means new protections will be possible in international waters for the first time.",
      "Here's a rundown of what the treaty is, why it matters and what is still to come.",
      "Formally known as the Agreement on Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction, the treaty is the first legally binding agreement aimed at protecting marine biodiversity in international waters. These areas, which lie beyond the jurisdiction of any single country, account for nearly two-thirds of the ocean and nearly half of Earth\u2019s surface.",
      "Until now, no comprehensive legal framework existed to create marine protected areas or enforce conservation on the high seas.",
      "Despite their remoteness, the high seas are under growing pressure from overfishing, climate change and the threat of deep-sea mining. Environmental advocates warn that without proper protections, marine ecosystems in international waters face irreversible harm.",
      "\u201cUntil now, it has been the wild west on the high seas,\u201d said Megan Randles, global political lead for oceans at Greenpeace. \u201cNow we have a chance to properly put protections in place.\u201d",
      "The treaty is also essential to achieving what's known as the global \u201c30x30\u201d target \u2014 an international pledge to protect 30% of the planet\u2019s land and sea by 2030.",
      "The treaty creates a legal process for countries to establish marine protected areas in the high seas, including rules for potentially destructive activities like deep-sea mining and geoengineering. It also establishes a framework for technology-sharing, funding mechanisms and scientific collaboration among countries.",
      "Crucially, decisions under the treaty will be made multilaterally through what\u2019s called a conference of the parties rather than by individual countries acting alone.",

      "The first conference of the parties must be held within a year of the treaty taking effect. It will lay the groundwork for implementation, including decisions on governance, financing and the creation of key bodies to evaluate marine protection proposals.",
      "Environmental groups are pushing for even more countries to ratify the treaty and to do so quickly \u2014 the more countries that ratify, the stronger and more representative the treaty\u2019s implementation will be. There\u2019s a carrot for countries to do so. Only those that ratify by that first conference will be eligible to vote on critical decisions that determine how the treaty will operate.",

      "Robin is a therapeutic robot programed to act like a 7-year-old girl as it travels around nursing homes and hospitals\u2019 pediatric units providing emotional support while helping to combat staffing shortages",
      "Days after Meagan Brazil-Sheehan\u2019s 6-year-old son was diagnosed with leukemia, they were walking down the halls of UMass Memorial Children\u2019s Medical Center when they ran into Robin the Robot.",
      "\u201cLuca, how are you?\u201d it asked in a high-pitched voice programmed to sound like a 7-year-old girl. \"It\u2019s been awhile.\u201d",
      "Brazil-Sheehan said they had only met the 4-foot-tall (1.2-meter-tall) robot with a large screen displaying cartoonlike features once before after they were admitted several days earlier.",
      "\u201cHis face lit up,\" she said about the interaction in June in Worcester, Massachusetts. \"It was so special because she remembered him.\u201d",
      "Robin is an artificial intelligence -powered therapeutic robot programed to act like a little girl as it provides emotional support at nursing homes and hospital pediatric units while helping combat staffing shortages. Five years after launching in the U.S., it has become a familiar face in 30 health care facilities in California, Massachusetts, New York and Indiana.",
      "\u201cNurses and medical staff are really overworked, under a lot of pressure, and unfortunately, a lot of times they don\u2019t have capacity to provide engagement and connection to patients,\u201d said Karen Khachikyan, CEO of Expper Technologies, which developed the robot. \u201cRobin helps to alleviate that part from them.\u201d",
      "As AI increasingly becomes a part of daily life, it's found a foothold in medical care \u2014 providing everything from note-taking during exams to electronic nurses. While heralded by some for the efficiency it brings, others worry about its impact on patient care.",
      "Robin is about 30% autonomous, while a team of operators working remotely controls the rest under the watchful eyes of clinical staff. Khachikyan said that with each interaction, they\u2019re able to collect more data \u2014 while still complying with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA \u2014 and get closer to it being able to function independently.",
      "\u201cImagine a pure emotional intelligence like WALL-E. We\u2019re trying to create that,\u201d he said, referencing the 2008 animated film.",
      "On a recent Friday, a staff member at HealthBridge Children\u2019s Hospital in Orange County, California, read off a list of patients she needed Robin to visit, along with the amount of time to spend with each one.",
      "The robot with a sleek white triangle-shaped frame that Khachikyan said was designed for hugging, rolled into a room with a teenager injured in a car accident. The robot played what it described as his favorite song \u2014 \u201cNo Fear\u201d by DeJ Loaf \u2014 and he danced along. In the hallway, Robin cracked up a young child held by her mother when it put on a series of silly glasses and a big red nose. In another room, the robot played a simplified version of tic-tac-toe with a patient.",
      "Samantha da Silva, speech language pathologist at the hospital, said patients light up when Robin comes into their room and not only remembers their names but their favorite music.",
      "\u201cShe brings joy to everyone,\u201d da Silva said. \u201cShe walks down the halls, everyone loves to chat with her, say hello.\u201d",
      "Robin mirrors the emotions of the person it is talking with, explained Khachikyan. If the patient is laughing then the robot laughs along, but if they're sharing something difficult, its face reflects sadness and empathy.",
      "In nursing homes, Robin plays memory games with people suffering from dementia, takes them through breathing exercises on difficult days and offers them a form of companionship that resembles a grandchild with a grandparent.",
      "Khachikyan recalled a moment last year at a facility in Los Angeles where a woman was having a panic attack and asked specifically for the robot. Robin played songs by her favorite musician and videos of her favorite animal \u2014 Elvis Presley and puppies \u2014 until she had calmed down.",

      "He said they\u2019re working to make the robot able to measure patients\u2019 vitals and check to see how they\u2019re doing and then send that information to their medical team. Longer term plans include designing Robin to help elderly patients change their clothes and go to the bathroom.",
      "\u201cOur goal is to design the next evolution of Robin; that Robin will take more and more responsibilities and become even more essential part of care delivery,\u201d Khachikyan said.",
      "He clarified that it\u2019s not about replacing health care workers but about filling in the gaps in the workforce.",
      "At UMass, the robot is very much a part of a team of support for patients. When Luca needed an IV after not getting one in a while, Micaela Cotas, a certified child life specialist came in with the robot and showed him an IV and what was about to happen, and then Robin played a cartoon of it getting an IV put in.",

      "Khachikyan gave the example of Robin\u2019s answer to the question: \u201cWhat is your favorite animal.\u201d Initially they tried having the robot respond with dog. They also tried cat. But when they tried chicken, the children cracked up. So they stuck with it.",
      "\u201cWe created Robin\u2019s personality by really taking users into the equation,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we often say that Robin was designed by users.\u201d",

      "It would be the second call with Xi since Trump returned to the White House and launched sky-high tariffs on China, triggering back-and-forth trade restrictions that strained ties between the two largest economies.

      "Drones used for defense and attack have taken a central battlefield role in the more than three years since Russia invaded Ukraine, transforming how wars are waged, and countries are keen to master the new and quickly developing battlefield technology.",

      "The neighbors will jointly test new methods of intercepting drones, exchange military experience in the field of drone warfare, and work to ensure more compatibility between the Ukrainian and Polish armed forces, Shmyhal wrote on Telegram.",
      "Last week\u2019s Russian incursion into Poland, which caused NATO to send fighter jets to shoot down the drones, heightened tensions in Eastern Europe about Moscow's territorial ambitions. The war between Russia and Ukraine has continued despite months of U.S. efforts to stop it, including a U.S.-Russia summit meeting in Alaska.",
      "NATO announced it was strengthening its defensive posture on its eastern flank bordering Belarus, Russia and Ukraine. Moscow, meanwhile, showcased its conventional and nuclear military power in long-planned exercises with Belarus that fueled Western concerns about Russia's intentions.",

      "A California judge has dismissed a lawsuit brought by an Indigenous tribe from the Brazilian Amazon against The New York Times and TMZ",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A California judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by an Indigenous tribe in the Brazilian Amazon against The New York Times and TMZ that claimed the newspaper\u2019s reporting on the tribe\u2019s first exposure to the internet led to its members being widely portrayed as technology-addled and addicted to pornography.",
      "The suit was filed in May by the Marubo Tribe of the Javari Valley, a sovereign community of about 2,000 people in the Amazon rainforest.",
      "Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Tiana J. Murillo on Tuesday sided with the Times, whose lawyers argued in a hearing Monday that its coverage last year was fair and protected by free speech.",
      "TMZ argued that its coverage, which followed the Times\u2019 initial reporting, addressed ongoing public controversies and matters of public interest.",
      "The suit claimed stories by TMZ and Yahoo amplified and sensationalized the Times\u2019 reporting and smeared the tribe in the process. Yahoo was dismissed as a defendant earlier this month.",
      "Murillo wrote in her ruling that though some may \u201creasonably perceive\u201d the Times\u2019 and TMZ\u2019s reporting as \u201cinsensitive, disparaging or reflecting a lack of respect, the Court need not, and does not, determine which of these characterizations is most apt.\u201d",
      "The judge added that \u201cregardless of tone, TMZ\u2019s segment contributed to existing debate over the effects of internet connectivity on remote Indigenous communities.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are pleased by the comprehensive and careful analysis undertaken by the court in dismissing this frivolous lawsuit,\" Danielle Rhoades Ha, a spokesperson for the Times, said in a statement Wednesday to The Associated Press. \"Our reporter traveled to the Amazon and provided a nuanced account of tension that arose when modern technology came to an isolated community.\u201d",
      "Attorneys for TMZ did not immediately respond to an email request for comment Wednesday.",
      "Plaintiffs in the lawsuit included the tribe, community leader Enoque Marubo and Brazilian journalist and sociologist Flora Dutra, who were both mentioned in the June 2024 story. Both were instrumental in bringing the tribe the internet connection, which they said has had many positive effects including facilitating emergency medicine and the education of children.",
      "N. Micheli Quadros, the attorney who represents the tribe, Marubo and Dutra, wrote to the AP Wednesday that the judge\u2019s decision \u201chighlights the imbalance of our legal system,\u201d which \u201coften shields powerful institutions while leaving vulnerable individuals, such as Indigenous communities without meaningful recourse.\u201d",

      "Quadros said the plaintiffs will decide their next steps in the coming days, whether that is through courts in California or international human rights bodies.",
      "\u201cThis case is bigger than one courtroom or one ruling,\u201d Quadros wrote. \u201cIt is about accountability, fairness, and the urgent need to protect communities that have historically been silenced or marginalized.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit sought at least $180 million, including both general and punitive damages, from each of the defendants.",
      "The suit argued that the Times\u2019 story by reporter Jack Nicas on how the group was handling the introduction of internet service via Starlink satellites operated by Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX \u201cportrayed the Marubo people as a community unable to handle basic exposure to the internet, highlighting allegations that their youth had become consumed by pornography.\u201d",
      "The court disagreed with the tribe\u2019s claims that the Times article falsely implied its youth were \u201caddicted to pornography,\u201d noting that the coverage only mentioned unidentified young men had access to porn and did not state that the tribe as a whole was addicted to pornography.",
      "Nicas reported that in less than a year of Starlink access, the tribe was dealing with the same struggles the rest of the world has dealt with for years due to the pervasive effects of the internet. The challenges ranged from \u201cteenagers glued to phones; group chats full of gossip; addictive social networks; online strangers; violent video games; scams; misinformation; and minors watching pornography,\" Nicas wrote.",
      "He also wrote that a tribal leader said young men were sharing explicit videos in group chats. The piece doesn't mention porn elsewhere, but other outlets amplified that aspect of the story. TMZ posted a story with the headline, \u201cElon Musk\u2019s Starlink Hookup Leaves A Remote Tribe Addicted To Porn.\u201d",
      "The Times published a follow-up story in response to misperceptions brought on by other outlets in which Nicas wrote: \u201cThe Marubo people are not addicted to pornography. There was no hint of this in the forest, and there was no suggestion of it in The New York Times\u2019s article.\u201d",
      "Nicas wrote that he spent a week with the Marubo tribe. The lawsuit claimed that while he was invited for a week, he spent less than 48 hours in the village, \u201cbarely enough time to observe, understand, or respectfully engage with the community.\"",

      "Charlie Kirk's mastery of social media was key to his rise as an influence in conservative politics. So the extent to which his death and its aftermath have played out on those forums shouldn't come as a surprise.",
      "In a microcosm of life today, social media is where Americans have gone to process last week's killing in Utah and is the chief tool his supporters are using to police those they feel aren't offering proper respect. Investigators are probing the time the man accused of killing Kirk, Tyler Robinson, spent in the \u201cdark corners of the internet\u201d \u2014 anti-social media, if you will \u2014 leading up to when he allegedly pulled the trigger.",
      "On the other side of the world, as the Kirk story preoccupied Americans, Nepal reeled from a spasm of violence that erupted when the government tried to ban social media platforms.",
      "All of this is forcing a closer look at the technologies that have changed our lives, how they control what we see and understand through algorithms, and the way all the time we spend on them affects our view of the world.",
      "Utah's governor, Republican Spencer Cox, believes \u201ccancer\u201d isn\u2019t a strong enough word to describe social media. \u201cThe most powerful companies in the history of the world have figured out how to hack our brains, get us addicted to outrage \u2026 and get us to hate each other,\u201d Cox said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d",
      "Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, urged Americans via social media to \u201cpull yourself together, read a book, get some exercise, have a whiskey, walk the dog or make some pasta or go fishing or just do anything other than let this algo pickle your brain and ruin your soul.\u201d",
      "Chilling videos of Kirk's Sept. 10 assassination immediately overwhelmed sites like X, TikTok and YouTube, and companies are still working to contain their spread. Confrontational material and conspiracy theories are pushed into social media feeds because they do precisely what they're designed to do \u2014 keep people on the platforms for longer periods of time.",
      "\u201cI do think we\u2019re in a moment here,\u201d said Laura Edelson, a Northeastern University professor and expert on social media algorithms. \u201cOur country is being digitally mediated. Where we interact with other people, how we interact with broader society, that is more and more happening over feed algorithms. This is the most recent in a long line of ways that society has been changed by media technology.\u201d",
      "Divisive content and the proliferation of the video of Kirk's death may not have been the goal but are the direct result of decisions made to maximize profits and cut back on content moderation, Edelson said.",
      "\u201cI don't think there are people twirling their mustaches saying how great it is that we've divided society, except the Russian troll farms and, more and more, the Chinese troll farms,\u201d she said.",
      "X owner Elon Musk posted on his site this past week that while discourse can become negative, \u201cit's still good there is a discussion going.\u201d President Donald Trump, who created his own social platform, was asked about Cox's comments Tuesday before leaving for a trip to the United Kingdom. He said that while social media can create \u201cdeep, dark holes that are cancerous,\u201d it wasn't all bad.",

      "Conservative media star Ben Shapiro, who considered Kirk a friend, admired how Kirk was willing to go to different places and talk to people who disagreed with him, a practice all too rare in the social media era.",
      "\u201cHow social media works is a disaster area, fully a disaster area,\u201d Shapiro said in an interview with Bari Weiss on a Free Press podcast. \u201cThere's no question it's making the world a worse place \u2014 and that's not a call for censorship.\u201d",

That's been the case when many people discuss Kirk's death, although the shooter's motives haven't become clear and there's no evidence his actions are anything other than his own.",
      "The liberal MeidasTouch media company has collected inflammatory social posts by conservatives, particularly those who suggest they're at \u201cwar.\u201d Meanwhile, several conservatives have combed social media for posts they consider negative toward Kirk, in some cases seeking to get people fired. The Libs of TikTok site urged that a Washington state school district be defunded because it refused to lower flags to half staff.",
      "GOP Rep. Randy Fine of Florida asked people to point out negative Kirk posts from anyone who works in government, at a place that receives public funding or is licensed by the government \u2014 a teacher or lawyer, for instance. \u201cThese monsters want a fight?\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cCongratulations, they got one.\u201d",
      "A Washington Post columnist, Karen Attiah, wrote Monday that she was fired for a series of Bluesky posts that expressed little sympathy for Kirk. But she wrote on Substack that \u201cnot performing over-the-top grief for white men who espouse violence was not the same as endorsing violence against them.\u201d A Post spokeswoman declined to comment.",
      "So much of what people use to talk about politics \u2014 algorithmically driven social media sites and cable television \u2014 is designed to pull Americans apart, said James Talarico, a Democratic state lawmaker in Texas who recently announced a bid for the U.S. Senate. \u201cWe've got to find our way back to each other because that's the only way we can continue this American experiment,\u201d he said on MSNBC.",
      "Among the most persistent examples of those divisions are the lies and misinformation about elections that have spread for years through online social channels. They have undermined faith in one of the country's bedrock institutions and contributed to the rage that led Trump supporters to violently storm the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "Whether meaningful change is possible remains an open question. Nepal's unrest illustrated the dangers of government involvement: Social media sites were shut down and users protested, suggesting it had been a way to stop criticism of the government. Police opened fire at one demonstration, killing 19 people.",
      "Persuading social media sites to change their algorithms is also an uphill battle. They live off attention and people spending as much time as possible on them. Unless advertisers flee for fear of being associated with violent posts, there's little incentive for them to change, said Jasmine Enberg, a social media analyst at Emarketer.",

      "The sides also agreed on entrusting a partner with handling U.S. user data and content security, he said.",
      "Though he has no clear legal basis to do so, Trump has continued to extend the deadline for TikTok to avoid a ban in the U.S. This gives his administration more time to broker a deal to bring the social media platform under American ownership. The next deadline is on Sept. 17, and Trump has already signaled he would extend it if needed.",
      "It is not clear how many times Trump can keep extending the ban as the government continues to try to negotiate a deal for TikTok, which is owned by China\u2019s ByteDance. While there is no clear legal basis for the extensions, so far, there have been no legal challenges against the administration. Trump has amassed more than 15 million followers on TikTok since he joined last year, and he has credited the trendsetting platform with helping him gain traction among young voters. He said in January that he has a \u201cwarm spot for TikTok.\u201d",

      "Authorities say that social media platforms should not require age verification for all users when a ban on children under 16 having accounts goes into effect in December in Australia",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australian authorities said Tuesday that social media platforms should not demand age verification for all account holders starting from December, when a ban on children under 16 having accounts goes into effect in the country.",
      "The government released guidelines on how platforms such as TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram should apply the world's first ban on children using social media from Dec. 10. It says verifying the ages of all account holders would be unreasonable.",
      "\u201cWe think it would be unreasonable if platforms reverified everyone\u2019s age,\u201d said Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant, who drafted the guidelines. Her use of the word \u201creverified\" suggested the platforms usually already had sufficient data to verify a user was older than 16.",
      "She said the platforms have \u201ctargeting technology\u201d to focus on those under 16.",
      "\"They can target us with deadly precision when it comes to advertising. Certainly they can do this around the age of a child,\u201d she added.",
      "Australia\u2019s Parliament enacted the ban last year, giving the platforms a year to work out its implementation. The platforms face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent children younger than 16 from holding accounts.",
      "Critics of the legislation fear that banning young children from social media will impact the privacy of all users who must establish they are older than 16.",
      "Inman Grant said claims the ban would see every Australian account holder subjected to age verification as a \u201cscare tactic.\u201d",
      "Communications Minister Anika Wells said the government seeks to keep platform users\u2019 data as private as possible.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists in Colombia\u2019s Amazon are capturing and testing endangered pink river dolphins to monitor mercury contamination from illegal gold mining and deforestation",
      "PUERTO NARINO, Colombia -- A flash of pink breaks the muddy surface of the Amazon River as scientists and veterinarians, waist-deep in the warm current, patiently work a mesh net around a pod of river dolphins. They draw it tighter with each pass, and a spray of silver fish glistens under the harsh sun as they leap to escape the net.",
      "When the team hauls a dolphin into a boat, it thrashes as water streams from its pink-speckled sides and the crew quickly ferries it to the sandy riverbank where adrenaline-charged researchers lift it onto a mat. They have 15 minutes \u2014 the limit for how long a dolphin can safely be out of the water \u2014 to complete their work.",
      "Fernando Trujillo, a marine biologist leading the effort, kneels beside the animal\u2019s head, shielding its eye with a small cloth so it can\u2019t see what\u2019s happening. He rests his hand gently on the animal and speaks in low tones.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve never felt the palm of a hand. We try to calm them,\u201d said Trujillo, sporting a pink dolphin bandana. \u201cTaking a dolphin out of the water, it\u2019s a kind of abduction.\u201d",
      "One person counts the dolphin's breaths. Another wets its skin with a sponge while the others conduct multiple medical tests that will help show how much mercury is coursing through the Amazon\u2019s most graceful predators.",
      "Trujillo directs the Omacha Foundation, a conservation group focused on aquatic wildlife and river ecosystems, and leads health evaluations of river dolphins. It's a painstaking operation involving experienced fishermen, veterinarians and locals that takes months of planning and happens a couple of times a year.",
      "\u201cWe take blood and tissue samples to assess mercury,\u00a8 Trujillo told The Associated Press from the Colombian riverside town of Puerto Narino. \u201cBasically, we\u2019re using dolphins as sentinels for the river\u2019s health.\u201d",
      "Mercury contamination comes mainly from illegal gold mining \u2014 a growing industry across the Amazon Basin \u2014 and forest clearing that washes mercury that naturally occurs in soil into waterways.",
      "The miners use mercury to separate gold from sediment, then dump the sludge back into rivers, where it enters fish eaten by people and dolphins. Rising global gold prices have fueled a mining boom, and mercury pollution in remote waterways has increased.",
      "Mercury can damage the brain, kidneys, lungs and immune system and cause mood swings, memory loss and muscle weakness in people, according to the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Pregnant women and young children are most at risk, with prenatal exposure linked to developmental delays and reduced cognitive function.",
      "\u201cThe maximum any living being should have is 1 milligram per kilogram,\u201d Trujillo said. \u201cHere, we\u2019re seeing 20 to 30 times that amount.\u201d",
      "In previous years, his team found 16 to 18 milligrams per kilogram of mercury in dolphins, which can suffer the same neurological damage, organ damage and other problems as humans. In Colombia\u2019s Orinoco River, levels in some dolphins have reached as high as 42, levels scientists say are among the most extreme ever recorded in the species.",
      "Trujillo said it's difficult to prove the toxin is directly killing dolphins. Further studies are underway, he added, noting that \u201cany mammal with a huge amount of mercury will die.\u201d",
      "When Trujillo and his team tested their own blood three years ago, his results showed more than 36 times the safe limit \u2014 36.4 milligrams per kilogram \u2014 a level he attributes to decades working in mercury-affected areas and a diet heavy in fish. With medical assistance, his levels have dropped to about 7 milligrams.",
      "\u201cMercury is an invisible enemy until it builds up to a sufficient amount, then it starts to affect the central nervous system,\u201d Trujillo told AP after his team managed to capture and test four pink dolphins. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing evidence of it in Indigenous communities.\u201d",
      "A series of scientific studies and reports \u2014 including work by the International Pollutants Elimination Network and academic researchers \u2014 have found high mercury exposure among Indigenous peoples across the Amazon, including in Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Suriname and Bolivia. Hair samples showed averages well above WHO's safe threshold of 1 part per million, with one Colombian community registering more than 22 milligrams per kilogram.",

Trujillo said exact numbers for the Amazon are unknown, but his organization estimates 30,000 to 45,000 across the basin.",

It banned mercury use in mining in 2018, ratified the Minamata Convention aimed at reducing mercury in the environment and submitted an action plan in 2024.

      "Other Amazon nations say they\u2019re stepping up. Brazil has launched raids and moved to restrict satellite internet used by illegal gold-mining camps that use mercury, aiming to disrupt logistics and supply lines. Peru recently seized a record 4 tons of smuggled mercury. Ecuador, Suriname and Guyana have filed action plans to cut mercury use in small-scale gold mining.",
      "The dolphin testing operation relies on Jos\u00e9 \u201cMariano\u201d Rangel, a charismatic former fisherman from Venezuela. He leads the charge when it\u2019s time to haul the animals \u2014 which can weigh as much as 160 kilograms (about 353 pounds) \u2014 into the small boats. It's a moment that can end with a stinging blow to the jaw as the dolphins thrash to break free.",
      "\u201cThe most difficult part of the captures is enclosing the dolphins,\u201d Rangel said.",
      "A portable ultrasound machine scans lungs, heart and other vital organs for disease. The team checks for respiratory problems, internal injuries and signs of reproduction, photograph the animals' skin and scars, swab blowholes and genital openings for bacterial cultures, and collect tissue for mercury testing. Microchips are implanted so researchers can identify each animal and avoid duplicating tests.",
      "Omacha has recorded antimicrobial resistance \u2014 bacteria that can\u2019t be killed by common medicines \u2014 and respiratory problems. They have also identified possible emerging diseases, such as papilloma virus, that could pose risks to both dolphins and humans.",
      "After a long morning hauling and testing dolphins, the scientists return to a laboratory in Puerto Narino that's covered with posters of dolphins and manatees and the bones and skulls of dolphins and other animals. They test some samples, prepare others to send to larger facilities and end their day repairing nets and refilling kits to do it all again at dawn.",
      "For Trujillo, each capture, scan and blood test is part of a larger fight.",

      "In 2007, Equatorial Guinea entered into a business deal with Somagec, a Moroccan construction company that develops ports and electricity transmission systems across West and Central Africa.",
      "Annob\u00f3n's geological formation and volcanic past make the island rich in rocks and expands Malabo's influence in the Gulf of Guinea, which is abundantly rich in oil. Somagec has also built a port and, according to activists, explored mineral extraction in Annob\u00f3n since it began operations on the island.",
      "Residents and activists said the company's dynamite explosions in open quarries and construction activities have been polluting their farmlands and water supply. The company's work on the island continues.",
      "Residents hoped to pressure authorities to improve the situation with their complaint in July last year. Instead, Obiang then deployed a repressive tactic now common in Africa to cut off access to internet to clamp down on protests and criticisms.",
      "This was different from past cases when Malabo restricted the internet during an election.",
      "\"This is the first time the government cut off the internet because a community has a complaint,\u201d said Tutu Alicante, an Annobon-born activist who runs the EG Justice human rights organization.",
      "The power of the internet to enable people to challenge their leaders threatens authorities, according to Felicia Anthonio of Access Now, an internet rights advocacy group. \"So, the first thing they do during a protest is to go after the internet,\u201d Anthonio said.",
      "Somagec\u2019s CEO, Roger Sahyoun, denied having a hand in the shutdown and said the company itself has been forced to rely on a private satellite. He defended the dynamite blasting as critical for its construction projects, saying all necessary assessments had been done.",
      "\u201cAfter having undertaken geotechnical and environmental impact studies, the current site where the quarry was opened was confirmed as the best place to meet all the criteria,\u201d Sahyoun said in an email.",
      "The residents, meanwhile, continue to suffer the internet shutdown, unable to use even the private satellite deployed by the company.",
      "\"Annob\u00f3n is very remote and far from the capital and the (rest of) continent,\" said Alicante, the activist from the island. \u201cSo you're leaving people there without access to the rest of the continent ... and incommunicado.\u201d",

      "U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert resigned his position Friday amid pressure from Trump administration officials to bring a criminal case against New York Attorney General Letitia James.",
      "Siebert, the U.S. attorney for the eastern district of Virginia, informed employees at his office in Alexandria of his decision to resign in an email that was obtained by ABC News.",
      "\"For the last eight months, I have had the pleasure of leading the finest and most exceptional of DOJ employees, who care deeply about our nation and our EDVA community,\" Siebert wrote. \"Thank you for the lessons you have taught me, the sacrifices you have made, and the pursuit of justice you strive for every day.\"",
      "Siebert was notified of the president's intention to fire him Thursday, sources said, and Trump said Friday afternoon in the Oval Office that he wanted Siebert \"out\" of his position.",
      "ABC News has reported that Trump was expected to fire Siebert after investigators were unable to find incriminating evidence of mortgage fraud against James, according to sources.\u00a0Trump officials had pushed Siebert to bring charges against James, despite investigators failing to find clear evidence that she committed a crime, sources said.",
      "\"It looks to me like she is very guilty of something, but I really don't know,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Friday.",
      "When asked about Siebert, Trump said he wanted him \"out\" of the position because Virginia's two Democratic Senators supported his nomination. Trump nominated Siebert for the position in May, and he has served as the interim U.S. attorney since Trump's inauguration.",
      "\"When I saw that he got approved by those two men, I said, pull it, because he can't be any good,\" Trump said. \"When I learned that they voted for him, I said, I don't really want him.\"",
      "While Siebert resigned from his position as interim U.S. attorney, he told his colleagues that he intends to continue working as a line prosecutor in the office, sources familiar with the matter said.",
      "It is unclear if he will be permitted to return to his previous role as an assistant U.S. attorney.",
      "Siebert's removal leaves one of the nation's most important U.S. attorney's offices without a leader, according to sources, as Siebert's deputy has already left her position and intends to continue work in the office as a line prosecutor. With her position vacant, there is currently no answer to who specifically will take over the office and whether any of its attorneys have any authority to continue regular prosecutorial activity.",

      "\"Firing people until he finds someone who will bend the law to carry out his revenge has been the President's pattern -- and it's illegal,\" Abbe Lowell said Friday morning in a statement to ABC News. \"Punishing this prosecutor, a Trump appointee, for doing his job sends a clear and chilling message that anyone who dares uphold the law over politics will face the same fate.\"",

      "James is \"a horror show who ran on the basis that she was going to get Trump before she even knew anything about me,\" Trump said during his civil fraud trial in 2023. \"This has to do with election interference, plain and simple. We have a corrupt attorney general in this state.\"",
      "Following a three-month trial, a New York judge concluded that Trump and his family had committed a decade of business fraud\u00a0by overstating the value of their properties to get favorable loan terms, fining Trump and his sons nearly half a billion dollars. An appeals court subsequently tossed the financial penalty but upheld the finding that Trump committed fraud.",
      "A former police officer with Washington, D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department, Siebert graduated from law school in 2009 and has worked as an assistant United States attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia since 2010. In addition to serving as a line prosecutor, Siebert headed the office's organized drug crime task force and supervised the office's Richmond division from 2019 to 2024.",
      "Siebert began serving as the interim U.S. attorney on Jan. 21 after the late Jessica Aber, who ran the office from 2021-25, resigned following President Trump's inauguration.

      "Residents of Santiago de Compostela are struggling with overtourism",
      "SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA, Spain -- While some Barcelona residents sought to repel a tsunami of tourists with plastic water pistols, a neighborhood association in Santiago de Compostela opted for a friendlier approach: a guide to good manners for visitors to their town, the endpoint of the Catholic world's most famous pilgrimage.",
      "Translated into several languages, the group posted it throughout the northwestern Spanish city and distributed it at its ever-growing number of hostels. It reminded tourists to keep noise down, respect traffic rules and use plastic protectors on hiking poles to avoid damaging the narrow cobblestone streets, among other things.",
      "To little avail, it would seem. Large groups still take over the streets singing hymns, bikes ride in the wrong direction and metal pole tips clatter against the ground. Santiago's social media is awash with photos denouncing a lack of decorum.",
      "Tourists' greater offense, though, stems from their sheer numbers; the old town and squares surrounding the cathedral holding the reputed tomb of Saint James the Apostle \u2014 and that was the center of town life for a millennium \u2014 today are almost exclusively the domain of outsiders, whose influx has served to expel residents. This dynamic has left Santiago emerging as the latest global destination where longtime residents have grown embittered by the overtourism transforming their community.",
      "\u201cWe do not have tourism-phobia. We have always lived in harmony with tourism, but when it gets out of hand, when the pressure goes beyond what is reasonable, that is when rejection arises,\u201d said Roberto Almu\u00ed\u00f1a, president of the neighborhood association in the old town that's a UNESCO World Heritage site.",
      "The \u201cCamino de Santiago,\u201d known in English as the Way of St. James, dates back to the 9th century, with pilgrims following its converging trails for up to hundreds of kilometers on paths originating in Portugal and France. The modern popularity it gained with the 2010 film \u201cThe Way\u201d starring Martin Sheen was turbocharged more recently by social media and experience-driven travel after the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "Last year, a record half-million people signed up to trek one of the approved routes to the cathedral \u2014 equal to five times the city\u2019s resident population, and marking a 725-fold increase over the last four decades. Added to those masses are ordinary tourists not arriving by trail.",
      "The proliferation of short-term rentals drove annual rent prices up 44% from 2018 to 2023, according to a study commissioned by the city council to the Fundaci\u00f3n Universidade da Coru\u00f1a. That led municipal authorities in May to request the regional government classify the area as a high-pressure zone, like Barcelona or San Sebastian, which would help to limit rent increases.",
      "Already, last November, Santiago's city council enacted a ban on Airbnb-style tourist accommodations in the historic center, arguing at the time in a statement that it was \u201ca necessity arising from its significant growth, which has clear effects on the number of housing units available for residents and on their price.\u201d",
      "Sihara P\u00e9rez, a researcher at the University of Santiago, described finding anywhere to rent in the city as \u201cmission impossible,\u201d while Antonio Jerem\u00edas, 27, told The Associated Press that he's considering moving back in with his mother, because his salary working full-time at a warehouse isn\u2019t enough to make ends meet.",
      "Andrea Dopazo, 32, tried to move out of her parents\u2019 house in a neighborhood located fully 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the city center. But her desire to continue living in the place where she grew up and community ties are strong proved futile, and she had to take something in a town outside Santiago.",
      "\u201cThe only people who have been able to stay in the neighborhoods are those who have been lucky \u2014 or unlucky \u2014 enough to inherit an apartment from their grandparents, uncles or parents,\u201d said Dopazo, who works in human resources.",

      "In the old town, tourists can stay in small hotels in former homes or huge hostels converted from former seminaries, which aren\u2019t subject to the ban. But in the hustle to cash in, some short-term rentals are apparently flouting the restriction, evidenced by tenants collecting keys from lockboxes hung outside buildings.",
      "\u201cSome follow the rules and others don\u2019t, but this is the model that is really limiting residential housing,\u201d said Montse Vilar, from another neighborhood group, Xuntanza.",
      "Santiago\u2019s City Hall told The Associated Press in a statement that it is \u201cdoing everything in its power to enforce the regulations\u201d and that it takes action whenever it detects a case of an illegal apartment housing tourists.",
      "Between 2000 and 2020, the historic center lost about half its permanent population, now reduced to just 3,000 residents who \u201cresist like the Gauls\u201d behind buildings' thick stone facades, Almu\u00ed\u00f1a said. There are no hardware stores or newsstands left, and just one bakery. A couple grocery stores coexist with cafes, ice cream parlors and souvenir shops.",
      "\u201cThe city has emptied out. You only have to take a walk to see that all we've got are closed, abandoned buildings that are falling apart,\u201d Almu\u00ed\u00f1a added.",
      "This year, the number of pilgrims reaching Santiago is on track to set another record. The surge is further souring Santiago's residents on their city's tourism-centric economic model; already half of them rejected it as of 2023, up from just over one-quarter a decade earlier, according to a study conducted by Rede Galabra, a research group focused on cultural studies at the University of Santiago.",
      "Even some of the pilgrims are noting a shift, like Spaniards \u00c1lvaro Casta\u00f1o and Ale Osteso who met on the route four years ago and have returned every year since.",
      "\u201cThe Camino is becoming more and more known, many more people are coming,\u201d Osteso said one recent morning at the end of their trek, among tour groups of pilgrims in bright, color-coordinated outfits and families snapping pictures. \u201cSpirituality seems to have been a little lost at times.\u201d",

      "\u201cThis was a great miscarriage of justice at the state level, and it shows the system has broken down and doesn\u2019t protect citizens,\u201d Evans said. \u201cIn a community like this, the federal government is the only avenue for anything to get done.\u201d",
      "Brown\u2019s beating was just the latest in a litany of police misconduct cases in DeSoto Parish, a rural swath of piney woods and rolling farmlands south of Shreveport, Louisiana.",
      "A month before Brown was pummeled, another deputy was charged with malfeasance after tackling and repeatedly punching a man walking into a grocery store. He agreed to a permanent ban from law enforcement in exchange for the charges being dismissed. In another case, a DeSoto Parish deputy was charged with third-degree rape after ordering a woman he arrested to perform oral sex on him.",
      "Russell Graham, a state police spokesperson, declined to explain his agency\u2019s conclusion that there \u201cwas not sufficient evidence\u201d the deputies in Brown's case committed a crime. He attributed delays in the investigation to the COVID-19 pandemic, which began six months after the beating.",
      "\u201cLSP remains committed to thorough, impartial investigations and working with partners to ensure accountability and uphold public trust,\u201d Graham wrote in an email to AP, adding the agency had \u201cconducted a thorough investigation of this matter when it was presented to them.\u201d",
      "Former deputy Javarrea Pouncy pleaded guilty to using excessive force and was sentenced last year to serve about three years in federal prison. He could not be reached for comment.",
      "The other deputy, DeMarkes Grant, who pleaded guilty to obstructing justice, was released from prison in April after serving a 10-month sentence. Grant told AP he was still \u201cstressed out\u201d and had \u201clost a lot\u201d as a result of his conviction. He declined to say whether he regretted the beating.",

      "A Missouri judge has struck down ballot summary for an anti-abortion amendment backed by Republican state lawmakers",
      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- A Missouri judge has struck down a ballot summary for an anti-abortion amendment backed by Republican state lawmakers while concluding that it presented an unfair and insufficient description to voters.",
      "Cole County Circuit Judge Daniel Green ruled Friday that the ballot summary must be rewritten, but he rejected a request by abortion-rights advocates to block the proposed constitutional amendment from going to voters.",
      "The judge said the summary prepared by Republican lawmakers failed to inform voters that the new measure would repeal an abortion-rights amendment adopted by voters last year. He directed the secretary of state's office to write a new summary.",
      "The ruling marks the latest in a series of twists and turns in Missouri\u2019s abortion policies over the past three years.",
      "When the U.S. Supreme Court ended a nationwide right to abortion by overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022, that triggered a Missouri law to take effect banning abortions \u201cexcept in cases of medical emergency.\u201d But abortion-rights activists then gathered initiative petition signatures to put their own measure on the ballot.",
      "Last November, Missouri voters narrowly approved a constitutional amendment guaranteeing a right to abortion until fetal viability, generally considered sometime past 21 weeks of pregnancy. That measure, known as Amendment 3, also allows later abortions to protect the life or health of pregnant women and creates a \u201cfundamental right to reproductive freedom\u201d that includes birth control, prenatal and postpartum care and \u201crespectful birthing conditions.\u201d",
      "In May, the Republican-led Legislature shut down Democratic opposition and approved a new referendum that would repeal Amendment 3 and instead allow abortions only for a medical emergency or fetal anomaly, or in cases of rape or incest up to 12 weeks of pregnancy. That proposed amendment also would prohibit gender transition surgeries, hormone treatments and puberty blockers for minors, which already are barred under state law.",
      "Abortion-rights advocates had argued in a lawsuit that the entire measure should be stricken, alleging that the combination of abortion and transgender policies violated a constitutional requirement that amendments contain only one subject. But Green agreed with Republican lawmakers that both topics fit under the measure's title of \u201creproductive health care.\u201d",

      "If the moves survive legal muster, they will deliver staggering price increases. The visa fee for skilled workers would jump from $215. The fee for investor visas, which are common in many European countries, would climb from $10,000-$20,000 a year.",
      "H-1B visas, which require at least a bachelor's degree, are meant for high-skilled jobs that tech companies find difficult to fill.

      "Oregon authorities say DNA has helped identify a woman's remains after 49 years",
      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- Valerie Nagle spent decades wondering what happened to her older sister who was last seen in Oregon in 1974. She searched online databases of unidentified persons cases looking for her and sent DNA to a popular ancestry website in the hopes of finding a match.",
      "That all changed in June when authorities in Oregon called Nagle \u201cout of the blue\u201d to ask about comparing her DNA to a cold case known as \u201cSwamp Mountain Jane Doe,\u201d she said. Nagle\u2019s DNA ultimately helped confirm that the remains of a woman found near a mountain creek in Oregon\u2019s Central Cascades in 1976 were that of her sister, Marion Vinetta Nagle McWhorter.",
      "Oregon State Police publicly released the news this week after the remains were identified in June.",
      "\u201cI was very surprised that they called,\u201d Nagle, a 62-year-old who lives in Seattle, told The Associated Press. She was 11 when her sister went missing. \u201cI was really glad that they found me through DNA.\u201d",
      "McWhorter was last seen at a shopping mall in the Portland suburb of Tigard when she was 21.",
      "She was the oldest of five siblings, and Nagle was the youngest. Their mother was Alaska Native of the Ahtna Athabascan people, Nagle said, and her big sister had been named for an aunt who died in a boarding school for Indigenous children in Alaska in 1940.",
      "High rates of disappearances of Indigenous people, particularly women, have festered for generations amid inadequate public safety resources.",
      "Nagle, who lived in New York with her parents and one of her brothers at the time of her sister's disappearance, said her mother may have contacted authorities but that she wasn\u2019t sure of the exact extent of the efforts made by her parents to find her sister.",
      "\u201cI mean, there were, you know, efforts to search, but it was limited,\u201d she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have that much to go on.\u201d",
      "She does know her sister had come from California to Oregon with plans to continue on to Seattle and eventually Alaska when she called an aunt who lived near the Tigard shopping mall for a ride in October 1974 \u2014 but the aunt didn\u2019t end up meeting up with her, Nagle said.",
      "Nearly 20 years later, the aunt shared another detail with Nagle: When McWhorter called her that day, she told her that a man in a white pickup truck had offered to give her a ride. It was unclear why her aunt waited that long to share that information.",

      "In 2010, a bone sample from McWhorter's remains was sent to the University of North Texas Center for Human Identification, and a profile was created in the national missing persons database NamUs, state police said. An additional bone sample was submitted for DNA extraction in 2020, allowing for a unique genetic marker profile to be produced.",
      "In 2023, Nagle did a DNA test when she signed up for Ancestry, a genealogy company with a DNA database, hoping it would yield a clue about her sister, she said.",
      "But the breakthrough came in April when a first cousin once removed uploaded their genetic profile to FamilyTreeDNA, another genealogy company with a DNA database, Oregon State Police spokesperson Jolene Kelley said in an email Thursday. That allowed genealogists to get a better idea of McWhorter's family tree and led them to find that Nagle was a surviving family member.",
      "\u201cThis case was cold for 49 years. That means that family members lived and died without ever knowing what happened to their missing loved one,\" State Forensic Anthropologist Hailey Collord-Stalder said in a statement, adding that McWhorter \u201clikely did not go missing voluntarily.\u201d",

      "YORK, Pa. -- The three detectives killed this week in one of Pennsylvania's deadliest days for police this century are men who will be missed for their humility, hard work and willingness to help others, say those who knew them.",
      "The detectives \u2014 Mark Baker, Cody Becker and Isaiah Emenheiser \u2014 were lauded by local law enforcement officials as pillars of the Northern York County Regional Police Department, where they had served nearly six decades combined.",
      "They had saved lives before and, a prosecutor said, were doing that again when they walked into an ambush as they searched for a 24-year-old man wanted in a stalking case.",
      "The department's chief, Dave Lash, said the men \u201crepresented the best of policing. They served with professionalism, dedication and courage.\u201d",
      "All were fathers, leaving behind wives and eight kids combined.",
      "Becker, 39, had served with the department for 16 years and had been a big name in his home town of Spring Grove going back to high school, when he was a star athlete for the Rockets in football, baseball and wrestling.",
      "\u201cTo know Cody was to know a man of unmatched dedication, grit, and unwavering selflessness,\u201d his former wrestling coaches said in a statement on social media.",
      "His high school football legend includes intercepting a pass from Chad Henne \u2014 who went on to quarterback in the NFL \u2014 and returning it for a touchdown.",
      "But he was most accomplished in wrestling.",
      "Becker went on to wrestle at Millersville University, even qualifying for the NCAA's Division 1 wrestling tournament in 2007. He returned to Spring Grove to mentor wrestlers there, an example of what the coaches say was unmatched humility and selflessness, \u201calways putting others before himself \u2014 traits that carried through every aspect of his life.\u201d",
      "Soon after joining the police force, Becker was honored for rescuing a mother and three children who were trapped on the third floor of a burning apartment building. The rescue included Becker climbing onto a second-story roof and catching the children as the mother dropped them into his arms, according to an FBI commendation bulletin.",
      "Becker loved being a cop, said Andy Ziegler, a lawyer who grew up with Cody.",
      "\u201cHe loved being able to help people. I mean, that was the big thing for him is he knew he was making a difference and he knew that he was helping people,\u201d Ziegler said.",
      "Becker was also the nicest person you were ever going to meet, he said. Ziegler recalled that when Becker heard Ziegler was struggling with his family and his mental health, Becker immediately went to see Ziegler.",
      "\u201cAnd that really does exemplify Cody. If you were a friend of Cody\u2019s, Cody had your back for life,\u201d Ziegler said.",
      "Baker, 53, started his career with the Philadelphia Police Department in 2001 and moved to the Northern York County Regional department in 2004.",

      "The mission of their sprawling walk was to unite a movement strong enough to hold America\u2019s leaders accountable in the face of mass firings at government agencies, the federal takeover of the District of Columbia\u2019s law enforcement and myriad disagreements with actions made by the Trump administration and the president himself.",
      "Marchers from across the country gathered in Philadelphia, then trekked through Newark, New Jersey; Wilmington, Delaware; Baltimore and beyond. Along the way they were housed in churches, where they slept in pews, or at people\u2019s homes. One night the group camped outdoors.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is trying to persuade a federal judge that Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's attempt to shut down part of an aging pipeline interferes with U.S. foreign policy",
      "The Trump administration is stepping into the legal fight over whether Enbridge can continue to operate an aging pipeline beneath a Great Lakes channel, arguing that Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer interfered with U.S. foreign policy when she revoked the line's easement almost five years ago.",
      "The pipeline, known as Line 5, has moved crude oil between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario, since 1953. A 4.5-mile (6.4-kilometer) segment of the line runs under the Straits of Mackinac, a channel that links Lake Michigan and Lake Huron.",
      "Concerns about the line rupturing and causing a catastrophic spill in the environmentally sensitive area have been growing since 2017, when Enbridge revealed its engineers had known about gaps in its protective coating since 2014. A boat anchor damaged the segment a year later, further stoking fears of a spill.",
      "Whitmer, a Democrat and possible 2028 presidential contender, ordered her regulators in November 2020 to revoke the easement allowing the segment to operate beneath the straits. Enbridge filed a federal lawsuit that same year seeking to invalidate the order. The pipeline has continued to operate as the litigation drags on.",
      "The Trump administration isn't a party in the case. But U.S. Justice Department attorneys filed a brief on Sept. 12 arguing that Whitmer's order amounted to an attempt to \u201cglobalize\u201d Michigan's regulatory authority and clash with the federal government's goal of maintaining the flow of energy between the U.S. and Canada.",
      "They also contend that the revocation clashes with executive orders President Donald Trump issued this year declaring that an abundant, reliable energy supply is key to protecting national security.",
      "\u201cShutting down Line 5 could disrupt the energy supply chain, increase domestic prices, and enhance the economic and political power and leverage of malign foreign actors worldwide,\u201d the attorneys wrote. \u201cSuch outcomes conflict with our nation's foreign policy goals.\u201d",
      "They argue, too, that only the federal government can regulate pipeline safety and allowing states to enter that arena would lead to a untenable patchwork of regulations. A 1977 treaty between the U.S. and Canada prohibits authorities from impeding the flow of energy through pipelines running between the two counties, they add.",
      "Whitmer's attorneys say the state has authority to revoke the easement under the public trust doctrine, the legal principle that natural resources belong to the public and the state therefore has a duty to protect them.",
      "Danny Wimmer, a spokesperson for Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, who is defending the revocation, said in an email Friday that Nessel plans to file a response in October. He pointed to earlier filings in which she argues that revoking the easement doesn't impose or continue any safety regulations and is actually a pipeline routing decision within the state's authority. The filings also contend that private parties such as Enbridge can't bring a federal lawsuit to enforce the treaty with Canada.",
      "The Trump administration's arguments largely mirror those of Enbridge. Asked for comment on the administration's filing, company spokesperson Michael Barnes in an email Friday pointed again to treaty provisions that he said prevent states and judges from unilaterally shutting down the pipeline.",

      "Enbridge has proposed encasing the straits segment in a protective concrete tunnel, at an estimated cost of at least $500 million. Construction would destroy wetlands and bat habitat but the tunnel would eliminate the chance of another anchor rupturing the line, according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.",
      "Michigan regulators approved permits for the tunnel in December 2023. Enbridge needs only Army Corps' approval before construction can begin. The Corps fast-tracked the permit in April after the Trump administration identified the tunnel for expedited emergency permitting.",
      "Environmental groups and Native American tribes have sued the Michigan Public Service Commission, arguing the panel didn't consider the overall need for the pipeline when weighing whether to grant the tunnel permits. The Michigan Supreme Court announced Friday that it would hear the case.",
      "Nessel filed her own lawsuit seeking to void the straits easement in 2019. The U.S. Supreme Court is weighing whether the case belongs in federal or state court.",
      "The pipeline is at the center of a yet another legal dispute, this time in Wisconsin. A federal judge in Madison last summer gave Enbridge three years to shut down part of Line 5 that runs across the Bad River Band of Lake Superior\u2019s reservation. The company has proposed rerouting the pipeline around the reservation and has appealed the shutdown order to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "On a separate legal track, environmental groups and the Bad River Band have asked a judge to void state permits for the reroute. Hearings in that matter are scheduled to stretch into October.",

      "Families of some of the victims of violent crime in Chicago say that although it's been a largely intractable problem for the city for decades, they don't think sending in National Guard troops is the answer",
      "Delphine Cherry knows as well as anyone how intractable violent crime is in Chicago. In 1992, her teenage daughter was gunned down in one of the city's tawniest neighborhoods \u2014 a bystander caught up in a gang shootout. Twenty years later in a suburb just south of the city, it claimed her son.",
      "\u201cYou don't think it's going to happen twice in your life,\u201d she said.",
      "Chicago has been bracing for weeks for President Donald Trump's promised deployment of National Guard troops to the nation's third-largest city. Although Trump said the troops would help fight crime in a city he described as a \u201chellhole,\u201d his administration has been tightlipped about the operation's details, including when it would start, how long it would last, how many troops would be used and what role they would play in civilian law enforcement.",
      "Trump has also veered back and forth on sending troops to Chicago \u2014 at times insisting he would act unilaterally to deploy them and at other points suggesting he would rather send them to New Orleans or some other city in a state where their governor \u201cwants us to come in.\u201d Most recently, he said this week that Chicago is \u201cprobably next\u201d after National Guard troops are sent to Memphis.",
      "Although Chicago has had one of the highest rates of gun violence of any major American city for some time, city and state leaders overwhelmingly oppose the planned operation, calling it political theater. And even those most directly affected, including people who have lost loved ones to violent crime, wonder how sending in troops would have any lasting effect on the fight against it.",
      "With plans for the Chicago deployment unknown, the ways National Guard troops have been used in Los Angeles and Washington this summer might offer clues.",
      "In June, Trump deployed thousands of Guard troops to Los Angeles amid protests over his administration's immigration crackdown there. Although the troops initially were assigned to guard federal property, they also provided protection for immigration agents during raids and took part in a show of force at a park in a heavily immigrant neighborhood of LA that local officials believe was meant to sow fear.",
      "In August, Trump announced he was placing Washington\u2019s police force under his control and mobilizing federal forces to reduce crime and homelessness there. The troops who were deployed have patrolled around Metro stations and in the most tourist-heavy parts of the nation's capital. But they have also been spotted picking up trash and raking leaves in city parks.",
      "The White House reported that more than 2,100 arrests had been made in Washington in the first few weeks after Trump announced he was mobilizing federal forces. And Mayor Muriel Bowser credited the federal deployment with a drop in crime, including an 87% decline in carjackings, but also criticized the frequent immigration arrests by masked ICE agents. However, an unusually high rate of cases being dropped has some, including at least one judge, wondering whether prosecutors are making charging decisions before cases are properly investigated and vetted.",
      "Washington is unique in that it is a federal district subject to laws giving Trump power to take over the local police force for up to 30 days. The decision to use troops to try to fight crime in other Democratic-controlled cities would represent an important escalation.",
      "Although the Trump administration hasn't said what the troops would be doing and what parts of Chicago they would operate in, they have explicitly promised a surge of federal agents targeting immigration enforcement. The city's so-called sanctuary policies are among the country's strongest and bar local police from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement.",
      "Chicago isn\u2019t the only Democratic-led city in Trump\u2019s sights \u2014 he\u2019s also mentioned Baltimore as a likely target. But Trump seems to harbor particular scorn for the Windy City, warning in an \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d-themed social media post earlier this month: \u201c\u2019I love the smell of deportations in the morning. Chicago about to find out why it\u2019s called the Department of WAR.\u201d",
      "The president's criticism, though, is more often focused on how the city's and state's Democratic leaders deal with crime.",
      "Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker have repeatedly pointed to a drop in crime in Chicago and have asked for more federal funding for prevention programs instead of sending in the National Guard.",

But the judge denied his motion for acquittal, meaning jurors will eventually decide the man's fate.",
      "Prosecutors rested their case against Ryan Routh Friday afternoon following testimony from 38 witnesses over seven days. After jurors were dismissed for the weekend, Routh, who is representing himself, made a motion for acquittal directly to U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon on four of the five counts against him, excluding the charge of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm.",

      "\u201cThey maybe proved that someone was outside the (golf course) fence with a gun, but the gun was never fired,\u201d Routh said.",
      "Routh said the area outside the Trump International Golf Club was a public right of way for a public road, and anyone had a right to be there with a weapon.",
      "Prosecutors responded that Routh took multiple substantial steps in his attempt to kill Trump, including aiming a loaded gun with its safety off through the fence.",
      "\u201cThis is as far from peaceful assembly as you can get,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney John Shipley said.",
      "Cannon denied Routh's motion, explaining that a juror could reasonably find that prosecutors had met their burden of proof. That means the next step is for the defense to begin its case Monday morning. Routh has indicated he plans to call three witnesses: a firearms expert and two character witnesses. He hasn\u2019t said whether he plans to testify himself. He told the judge Friday that his case should take about half a day.",
      "Cannon said attorneys should be prepared to deliver their closing arguments on Tuesday, giving each side one hour and 45 minutes. Jurors will begin deliberating after that. Cannon had initially blocked off more than three weeks for the trial at the Fort Pierce federal courthouse, but Routh's relatively short cross examinations have led to a quicker pace than anticipated.",

      "Evidence showed that Routh traveled to South Florida about a month before the assassination attempt, McGreevy said. He lived out of a black Nissan Xterra, normally parked at a western Palm Beach County truck stop, while routinely traveling to the areas around Palm Beach International Airport, Trump International Golf Course and Trump's primary residence at Mar-a-Lago, the agent said.",

      "\"I went through a lot. I had a difficult, in some ways, a difficult upbringing,\" she said. \"I had this kind of urge, this like burning desire to escape in any way, shape or form I could.\"",
      "Music became her outlet and source of achievement. Her career took a pivotal turn at 16 when she performed at the Bedford Pub in 2017, where manager Nick Shymansky, who had previously managed Amy Winehouse, was in attendance. The encounter changed both their lives.",
      "\"I walked into the room just when you went on stage, and I was like, 'Who is this?'\" Shymansky said. \"I was completely seduced by Lola's talent and character.\"",
      "For Young, the connection with Shymansky was immediate and profound. \"I just didn't want anyone else. I met with so many managers and I was like, 'Nah,'\" she said. \"He understood me in a way I've never been understood by any person.\"",
      "Young draws inspiration from legendary artists like Joni Mitchell, whose album \"Blue\" made a lasting impact when she first heard it when she was a teenager.",
      "\"I remember hearing 'A Case of You' and I just don't know why, but I just cried. And I thought, if I can do that to somebody then I've done, then I think I've done something,\" she said.",
      "Her dedication to music runs deep. \"I'm very serious about it. Yeah. I sometimes wish that it was just a bit less deep for me. But it is not,\" she admitted.",
      "Leaving her mark on music",
      "Despite her artistic success, Young faced severe personal struggles in recent years. \"I was in a really bad place. I didn't want to be here. Didn't care about myself. Didn't care about anything,\" she shared about a period of mental health challenges that lasted several years.",
      "The turning point came just over a year ago. She says she's now the happiest she's ever been.",
      "Young admits finishing songs can be stressful and when they're finally complete it's \"like a weight being lifted.\" Personally, she finds being on stage performing the most thrilling part of her job.",
      "Even as she enjoys newfound fame, Young remains vulnerable to criticism, admitting she sometimes cried over negative comments but is learning to manage the toll of public scrutiny.",
      "\"Today, I'm like absolutely not,\" said Young, referring to letting social media remarks get under her skin.",
      "When it comes to her future, Young says she plans to leave a mark.",
      "\"I want to put a stamp on music because all the best, all the people that I love or the best artists that I love have done that,\" she said.",

      "Fellow late-night show hosts used a mix of humor, expressions of solidarity and even a song to respond to the suspension of\u00a0ABC host Jimmy Kimmel\u00a0in their shows on Thursday.",
      "Jon Stewart, who made a special appearance to skewer Kimmel's suspension, opted for satire to critique ABC for suspending \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" indefinitely following comments Kimmel made about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.",
      "Stephen Colbert, whose show was canceled by CBS two months ago,\u00a0called Kimmel's suspension \"blatant censorship.\"",
      "Meanwhile, NBC's Jimmy Fallon praised Kimmel and vowed to keep doing his own show as usual. Then an announcer spoke over him and replaced most of his critiques about President Trump with flattery.",
      "Their guests the day after Kimmel's suspension varied widely. Fallon's guests were actor Jude Law, journalist Tom Llamas and actor and singer Jonathan Groff \u2014 none of whom addressed Kimmel's situation.",
      "Stewart and Colbert interviewed guests who could address censorship concerns raised by Kimmel's suspension. American and Filipino journalist and Nobel Peace Prize recipient Maria Ressa spoke to Stewart.",
      "When Stewart asked Ressa, the author of \"How to Stand Up to a Dictator,\" for tips on coping with the current moment, Ressa recounted how she and her colleagues at the news site Rappler \"just kept going\" when she was faced with 11 arrest warrants in one year under the Philippines' then-President Rodrigo Duterte.",
      "\"We just kept doing our jobs. We just kept putting one foot in front of the other,\" Ressa said.",
      "Kimmel's show was \"preempted indefinitely\" by ABC on Wednesday following comments he made about the reaction to Kirk's killing on Monday and Tuesday nights. The suspension came after media giant Nexstar announced in a news release that it would indefinitely preempt Kimmel's show on all its stations due to the host's remarks. Sinclair Broadcast Group, another major station owner, also said it was pulling the show.",
      "Nexstar has\u00a0a deal pending to purchase Tegna, a smaller rival, for $6.2 billion, and needs the Federal Communications Commission to approve it.",

      "FCC Chairman Brendan Carr also said his agency had a strong case for holding Kimmel, ABC and network parent Walt Disney Co. accountable for spreading misinformation.",
      "Kimmel has not commented.",
      "Stewart's show opened with a voice-over promising adherence to the party line.",
      "\"We have another fun, hilarious administration-compliant show,\" it said.",
      "He lavished praise on the president and satirized his criticism of large cities and his deployment of the National Guard to fight their crime.",
      "\"Coming to you tonight from the real (expletive), the crime-ridden cesspool that is New York City. It is a tremendous disaster like no one's ever seen before. Someone's National Guard should invade this place, am I right?\" Stewart said.",
      "\"The Daily Show\" set was refashioned with decorative gold engravings, in a parody of the new gold accents that Mr. Trump has added to many parts of the Oval Office.",
      "Stewart fidgeted nervously with his notes as though he was worried about mis-speaking or deviating from his talking points. When members of the audience reacted with an \"aww,\" he whispered, \"What are you doing? Shut up. You're going to (expletive) blow this for us.\"",
      "He took on a more stilted tone when he started describing Mr. Trump's visit to the United Kingdom, calling the president \"our great father.\"",
      "\"Gaze upon him. With a gait even more majestic than that of the royal horses that prance before him,\" he said.",
      "Stewart normally hosts only on Mondays. The Emmy winner helmed \"The Daily Show\" from 1999 through 2015, delivering sharp, satirical takes on politics and current events and interviews with newsmakers. He returned to host once a week during the run-up to the 2024 U.S. presidential election.",
      "Fallon opened his \"Tonight Show\" monologue addressing Kimmel's suspension.",
      "\"To be honest with you all, I don't know what's going on. And no one does. But I do know Jimmy Kimmel, and he's a decent, funny and loving guy, and I hope he comes back,\" he said.",
      "Colbert started his monologue on Thursday with the animated song \"Be Our Guest\" from Disney's \"Beauty and the Beast,\" but replaced the lyrics with \"Shut your trap. Shut your trap.\"",
      "He later addressed Kimmel directly, saying he stands with him and his staff.",
      "\"If ABC thinks that this is going to satisfy the regime, they are woefully naive,\" he said.",
      "He also responded to remarks Carr made that it is important for broadcasters to push back on Disney programming, \"they determine falls short of community values.\"",
      "\"Well, you know what my community values are, buster? Freedom of speech,\" Colbert said to loud applause from his audience.",
      "When Colbert talked with New Yorker editor David Remnick about Kimmel's suspension, he said: \"What we are seeing now is the government acting at the direction of the president of the United States to put pressure on, to manipulate, to silence and even to shut down institutions of the free world.\"",
      "David Letterman, Colbert's predecessor on \"The Late Show,\" lamented the networks' moves.",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "Academy Award-winning actor-director Robert Redford (Aug. 18, 1936-Sept. 16, 2025) was one of the biggest movie stars to ever grace the screen. His startlingly-magnetic charisma in such films as \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\" \"The Way We Were,\" \"The Sting\" and \"All the President's Men,\" and his nonchalance about his striking good looks, made him one of the leading box office draws of the 1970s and '80s.",
      "He became as well known for founding the Sundance Institute, using his celebrity to help nurture independent films while promoting generations of young filmmakers, as well as environmental and social justice issues. Since 1985 the institute hosted the internationally famous Sundance Film Festival, which has been the launching pad for innumerable talents, from Quentin Tarantino, John Sayles and Christopher Nolan to the Coen Brothers, Ryan Coogler and Jordan Peele, and for such audience favorites as \"Sex, Lies and Videotape,\" \"Little Miss Sunshine,\" \"Beasts of the Southern Wild,\" and \"The Blair Witch Project.\" In 1989 the New York Times called Redford \"a godfather to the American independent film movement.\"",
      "Yet, according to Redford, his fame was hardly predictable. \"I was so much the last choice\" for the role of the Sundance Kid opposite Paul Newman, he told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2006. \"They tried everything to keep me out of the picture because I wasn't known, compared to Paul.\"",
      "His performance changed all that. Four years later, Redford and Newman re-teamed in Hill's Oscar-winning caper, \"The Sting,\" which won seven Academy Awards, including best picture. Redford was also nominated for best actor for his performance as a small-time con artist out for revenge against a big-city gambler (played by Robert Shaw).",
      "Redford's remarkable screen presence was a highlight of a slew of pictures: \"Downhill Racer,\" \"The Hot Rock,\" \"Jeremiah Johnson,\" \"The Candidate,\" \"The Way We Were\" with Barbra Streisand, \"The Great Gatsby\" with Mia Farrow, \"The Great Waldo Pepper,\" \"Three Days of the Condor\" with Faye Dunaway, \"The Electric Horseman\" with Jane Fonda, and \"Brubaker.\"",
      "But his most surprising film was one which he produced and fought for: the acclaimed 1976 drama, \"All the President's Men,\" the story of Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, who uncovered the Watergate scandal. \"It took four years, and the studio, they said, 'Politics? I don't think so,'\" Redford said in 2006. \"'You know, Watergate is a dead issue.' And I said, 'It's not. It's a detective story about investigative journalism and about the American trait of hard work, and hard work [which] led to something that spared us the loss of our first amendment. That to me is worth making.\"",
      "Redford starred in hit after hit, but he told \"Sunday Morning \" in 2018 many of those films he's never watched. Really? \"I don't know. I haven't ever counted 'em, but a lot,\" Redford said. \"'Cause I thought if I look at myself too much, I'm gonna be too aware of myself and that means when I go to do something new, I won't be able to do it without being slightly aware of what I'm doing rather than just being free.\"",
      "He moved on to a job where he wouldn't have to look at himself \u2014 behind the camera, as director of \"Ordinary People,\" starring Mary Tyler Moore and Donald Sutherland. The film won best picture, best supporting actor for Timothy Hutton (in his film debut), and best director for Redford.",
      "While he continued appearing on screen (\"The Natural,\" \"Out of Africa\" with Meryl Streep, \"Legal Eagles,\" \"Indecent Proposal,\" \"Sneakers,\" \"The Last Castle,\" \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier,\" \"Truth,\" \"All Is Lost,\" \"A Walk in the Woods,\" \"The Old Man & the Gun\"), he returned to the director's chair eight times, with an eclectic mix of stories and genres: \"The Milagro Beanfield War,\" about a land war pitting a Hispanic farmer against real estate interests; \"A River Runs Though It,\" a period drama of family and fly-fishing, with Brad Pitt; \"Quiz Show,\" about TV's quiz show scandal in the 1950s; \"The Horse Whisperer,\" about a horse trainer with a remarkable gift; \"The Legend of Bagger Vance,\" a golf fable with Will Smith and Matt Damon; \"Lions for Lambs,\" a political drama of wartime co-starring Tom Cruise and Meryl Streep; \"The Conspirator,\" about the Confederate plot surrounding Lincoln's assassination; and the political thriller \"The Company You Keep.\"",
      "Meanwhile, much of his energy was devoted to the success of the Sundance Institute and its eponymous film festival, held in the mountains of Utah each January, and to its workshops and screenwriting labs.",
      "In 2018, the private Redford reflected to \"Sunday Morning\" on a favorite saying by T.S. Eliot:\" \"There's only the trying. The rest is not our business. It's one of my favorite phrases. Because you can't guarantee where the trying is going to get you. So, you can't guarantee the result. The only thing there is in its place is the trying. That's where the action is.\""

      "The Grammy winner revealed she is pregnant and having a baby with her boyfriend, New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs, confirming weeks of speculation about her personal life. She said the baby is due before the start of her first arena tour, \"Little Miss Drama,\" which begins in February.",
      "The 32-year-old said she feels \"excited\" and \"happy,\" while preparing to release new music and balancing motherhood.",
      "\"I feel like I'm in a good space. I feel very strong. I feel very powerful that I'm doing all this work. But I'm doing all this work while I'm creating a baby, me and my man, we're very supportive of each other,\" she said.",
      "Cardi B said she and Diggs share the same ambition, each determined to be \"the greatest\" in their fields. She also credited Diggs with giving her a sense of stability as she readies her next album, \"Am I The Drama?,\" which includes a track called \"Safe.\"",
      "\"And he just makes me feel safe and very confident and very strong,\" she said. \"I mean, like, two weeks ago I was literally having a panic attack. I was, like, crying and crying and crying, just because I was just getting really nervous with you know, the whole album rollout ... People were coming at me very hard. You know, sometimes people love you, people hate you. And people was just saying very mean things about me.\"",
      "She admitted harsh criticism sometimes makes her question releasing music.",
      "\"And I'm like, see, this is why I don't put music out, because it's like, this is my art and this is something that I put a lotta love and time to. And it's just like, sometimes, when people just rip it apart it just hurts you and it crushes you,\" she said.",

      "\"He makes me feel very confident... And it makes you feel like you could take over the world.\"",
      "She added that she waited to announce the pregnancy until she was able to \"close some deals first.\" She also admitted she has not yet told her parents, jokingly saying she is \"scared of them.\"",
      "Cardi B, who shares three children with rapper Offset, said she was reluctant to fall in love again amid their high-profile divorce. But she recalled Diggs telling her: \"Let me heal you. Give me a chance for me to heal you.\"",
      "Now that pregnancy rumors are confirmed, Cardi B used her world-famous humor to ask fans to purchase her new album: \"Now y'all could buy my album so I can buy Pampers and diapers and all that type of stuff. I told you. Now go support my album, cause I'm a mother of four now.\"",

      "Academy Award-winning actor and director Robert Redford, one of the biggest movie stars to ever grace the screen and whose startlingly magnetic charisma in such films as \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\" \"The Way We Were\" and \"The Sting\" made him an icon, has died. He was 89.",
      "Cindi Berger, CEO of the publicity firm Rogers & Cowan PMK, confirmed Redford's death to CBS News in a statement. Berger said he died Tuesday at his home in the mountains of Utah surrounded by those he loved. She didn't provide details about the circumstances surrounding his death.",
      "Barbra Streisand, who starred alongside Redford in the 1973 romantic drama \"The Way We Were,\" said the Hollywood legend was \"one of the finest actors ever\" in a tribute on social media.",
      "\"Every day on the set of The Way We Were was exciting, intense and pure joy,\" Streisand said. \"We were such opposites: he was from the world of horses; I was allergic to them! Yet, we kept trying to find out more about each other, just like the characters in the movie.\"",
      "Actor Robin Wright, who worked with Redford on his 2010 film \"The Conspirator,\" praised the actor and director during an interview on \"CBS Mornings Plus\" after news of his death was announced.",
      "\"He was amazing,\" Wright said. \"I mean, what an icon, and his body of work will live on forever. And to be able to be directed by an actor, that was fantastic, and that's such a rarity. And he's an icon that's going to be greatly missed.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters outside the White House before traveling to the U.K., President Trump said, \"I'll tell you, Robert Redford was great. He had a series of years that he was \u2014 there was nobody better.\"",
      "Redford burst into the Hollywood stratosphere in the late 1960s, when he was paired with Paul Newman in the Western \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\" Their charm playing lovable outlaws was undeniable, but it would be Redford's nonchalance about his striking good looks that helped sell his characters \u2014 in comedies, dramas and adventures \u2014 making him one of the leading box office draws of the 1970s and '80s.",
      "Then, as founder of the Sundance Institute, he used his celebrity to help nurture independent films while promoting generations of young filmmakers, as well as environmental and social justice issues. Since 1985, the institute has hosted the internationally famous Sundance Film Festival, which has been the launching pad for innumerable talents, from Quentin Tarantino, John Sayles and Christopher Nolan to the Coen brothers. In 1989, the New York Times called Redford \"a godfather to the American independent film movement.\"",
      "In a joint statement with other Sundance Institute leadership, acting CEO Amanda Kelso said, \"Today is a sad day for the Sundance Institute community. Bob's vision launched a movement that, over four decades later, has inspired generations of artists and redefined cinema in the U.S. and around the world.\"",
      "\"The vibrant storytelling landscape we cherish today, both as artists and audiences, is unimaginable without his passionate drive and principled leadership. Beyond Bob's enormous contributions to culture at large, we will miss his generosity, clarity of purpose, curiosity, rebellious spirit, and his love for the creative process,\" the statement said, in part.",
      "According to Redford, his fame was hardly predictable.",
      "\"I was so much the last choice\" for the role of the Sundance Kid, he told CBS' \"Sunday Morning\" in 2006. \"They tried everything to keep me out of the picture because I wasn't known, compared to Paul [Newman].\"",
      "His performance changed all that. The comedy-drama, directed by George Roy Hill, topped the box office chart for 1969.",
      "Four years later, Redford and Newman teamed up again in Hill's caper \"The Sting,\" which won seven Academy Awards, including best picture. Redford was also nominated for best actor for his performance as a small-time con artist out for revenge against a big-city gambler (played by Robert Shaw).",
      "Redford would star in 16 features between 1969 and 1980, many of them hits that traded on his remarkable screen presence: \"Downhill Racer,\" \"The Hot Rock,\" \"Jeremiah Johnson,\" \"The Candidate,\" \"The Great Gatsby\" with Mia Farrow, \"The Great Waldo Pepper,\" \"Three Days of the Condor\" with Faye Dunaway, \"The Electric Horseman\" with Jane Fonda and \"Brubaker.\" So bright was his star power that he reportedly earned a $2 million paycheck for what was barely a walk-on in the World War II epic \"A Bridge Too Far.\"",
      "But his most surprising film was one which he produced and fought for: the acclaimed 1976 drama \"All the President's Men,\" the story of Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, who uncovered the Watergate scandal.",
      "\"It took four years, and the studio, they said, 'Politics? I don't think so,'\" Redford said in 2006. \"You know, 'Watergate is a dead issue.' And I said, 'It's not. It's a detective story about investigative journalism and about the American trait of hard work, and hard work led to something that spared us the loss of our First Amendment. That, to me, is worth making.'\"",
      "The film was nominated for eight Oscars and won four, including for its screenplay by William Goldman, and for Jason Robards' performance as Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee.",
      "Redford starred in hit after hit, but he told \"Sunday Morning \" in 2018 many of those films he's never watched. Really? \"I don't know. I haven't ever counted 'em, but a lot,\" Redford said. \"'Cause I thought if I look at myself too much, I'm gonna be too aware of myself and that means when I go to do something new, I won't be able to do it without being slightly aware of what I'm doing rather than just being free.\"",
      "He moved on to a job where he wouldn't have to look at himself \u2014 behind the camera, as director of \"Ordinary People.\" Based on the novel by Judith Guest, it tells of an affluent family whose veneer of stability is shattered after one son dies in a boating accident and another attempts suicide. It starred Donald Sutherland, Mary Tyler Moore in a rare dramatic role, Judd Hirsch and Timothy Hutton, who won a best supporting actor Academy Award for his feature film debut. The film also won best picture, and for Redford a best director Oscar.",
      "In the decade following \"Ordinary People,\" he appeared on screen only a few times \u2014 in the baseball tale \"The Natural,\" the Oscar-winning \"Out of Africa\" opposite Meryl Streep, and the romantic comedy \"Legal Eagles.\"",
      "He would also return to the director's chair eight times, with an eclectic mix of stories and genres: \"The Milagro Beanfield War,\" about a land war pitting a Hispanic farmer against real estate interests; \"A River Runs Though It,\" a period drama of family and fly-fishing, with Brad Pitt; \"Quiz Show,\" about TV's quiz show scandal in the 1950s; \"The Horse Whisperer,\" about a horse trainer with a remarkable gift; \"The Legend of Bagger Vance,\" a golf fable with Will Smith and Matt Damon; \"Lions for Lambs,\" a political drama of wartime co-starring Tom Cruise and Streep; \"The Conspirator,\" about the Confederate plot surrounding Lincoln's assassination; and the political thriller \"The Company You Keep.\"",
      "\"One of the lions has passed,\" Streep said in a statement Tuesday. \"Rest in peace my lovely friend.\"",
      "Scarlett Johansson, who said Redford cast her in \"The Horse Whisperer\" when she was just 11 years old, remembered him as someone who was \"patient and warm and kind.\"",
      "\"Every day before each scene, he would take the time to sit with me and walk me through all of the beats that led my character up until that particular point in the story. No matter the reality of the days rush, I always felt he had all the time in the world for our work,\" Johansson said. \"Bob taught me what acting could be, and it was from his generosity and patience that I was inspired to pursue the possibilities of the craft.\"",
      "Redford made perhaps his biggest contribution to movies by founding the Sundance Institute, which developed and fostered the work of young and diverse independent filmmakers outside of mainstream Hollywood. Begun in 1981, Sundance encompassed workshops with writers, directors and actors, and later hosted the internationally recognized film festival.",
      "Asked by Collider in 2019 his reasons for founding the institute, Redford said, \"The goal for me was very simple: to celebrate people who don't get celebrated, who are ignored or undiscovered and who deserve to be discovered.\"",
      "The road to stardom",
      "Charles Robert Redford Jr. was born on Aug. 18, 1936, in Santa Monica, California. Raised in Van Nuys, Redford described his neighborhood as \"lower working class.\" Though he lived in the shadow of Hollywood, he had no interest in a career in the movies.",
      "\"I grew up in kind of a rough neighborhood,\" he said. \"We'd go to matinees, any time there was a love scene on the screen, we'd go, 'Oh boo, you tell 'em lover,' you know, and make fun of the scene. The idea that I would be that guy is just too much for me to take!\"",
      "He attended the University of Colorado in Boulder, where he had an athletic scholarship, but was kicked out after his freshman year for drinking, shortly after the death of his mother, Martha, in 1955.",
      "He ventured to Europe, studying art in France, Italy and Spain, before settling in New York City, where he took art classes at the Pratt Institute while also studying acting at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He described being self-conscious in his early experiences onstage, but soon recognized \"something unfamiliar was clicking inside.\" He performed in school productions of \"The Seagull\" and \"Antigone,\" attracting an agent, and was soon on Broadway in \"Tall Story\" and \"The Highest Tree,\" before starring with Julie Harris in \"Little Moon of Alban,\" in 1960.",
      "He also made guest appearances on TV shows such as \"Maverick,\" \"Playhouse 90,\" \"Perry Mason,\" \"Naked City,\" \"Route 66\" and \"The Twilight Zone.\" He co-starred with Jason Robards in a 1960 TV version of Eugene O'Neill's \"The Iceman Cometh,\" directed by Sidney Lumet.",
      "In 1961 he starred on Broadway in \"Sunday in New York,\" and two years later in the Neil Simon comedy \"Barefoot in the Park,\" directed by Mike Nichols. It was a role he repeated in the 1967 film, opposite Jane Fonda.",
      "\"I held some fantasy out in my head that I would return to art, and I carried that maybe five years into my acting career,\" Redford said, \"and then finally one day just looked at myself in the mirror, and I said, 'Who are we kidding? This is what you do. This is what you do well and like it. Give up the idea that you're going to maintain this career in art.'\"",
      "His film appearances grew following a big screen debut in the 1962 World War II drama \"War Hunt\" (co-starring future director Sydney Pollack).",
      "But Redford wasn't considered a big enough name to co-star with Paul Newman in \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" \u2014 the studio wanted anyone but him, even after the film's director and screenwriter went to bat for him. It wasn't until Newman, 11 years his senior and already a big name, met with Redford and told the studio he wanted Redford to co-star, that he got the part.",
      "It was a generosity that Redford returned some years later, when he went to bat for Newman to co-star in \"The Sting.\"",
      "\"Follow the money\"",
      "While on a press tour for \"The Candidate,\" his 1972 satire about a California lawyer's run for Senate against a popular incumbent, Redford sought out Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward after reading some of the reports he and Carl Bernstein had written on the 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters. The movie star was rebuffed. [Bernstein feared Republican backlash to their reporting if it was found out they were talking with Hollywood.] They finally met up in 1973, along with screenwriter William Goldman, and in 1974 Redford bought the film rights to the pair's yet-to-be-published book, \"All the President's Men,\" for $450,000.",
      "Starring Redford as Woodward and Dustin Hoffman as Bernstein, and directed by Alan J. Pakula, the film captured the intensity of the reporters' hunt for answers as they sought to \"follow the money\" and unravel the Watergate scandal.",
      "Never mind that audiences knew how the story ended (Nixon resigned); the film was a critical and commercial hit, and became an inspiration for generations of young journalists.",
      "Once Redford had gotten the taste of directing with \"Ordinary People,\" his appearances in front of the camera grew fewer: \"Havana,\" \"Sneakers,\" \"Indecent Proposal,\" \"Up Close & Personal,\" \"The Last Castle,\" \"Spy Game,\" and \"An Unfinished Life\" filled out his acting resume for the years between 1990 and 2005. He also narrated the 1992 documentary \"Incident at Oglala,\" about Indigenous activist Leonard Peltier. Redford's companies, Wildwood Enterprises and Sundance Productions, produced at least two dozen feature films.",
      "Meanwhile, much of his energy was devoted to the success of the Sundance Institute and its film festival, held in the mountains of Utah each January.",
      "Welcome to Sundance",
      "In 1978 the Utah Film Commission established the United States Film Festival as a means to draw visitors to the Wasatch Mountains for something other than skiing. The festival was co-created by Sterling Van Wagenen, who was a cousin of Redford's then-wife, Lola Van Wagenen. Advocating to include independent features in the program, Redford agreed to show up at the festival and participate in a panel. Afterwards, he formed the Sundance Institute, to aid filmmakers wishing to make stories that could not find a home among Hollywood studios that were chasing hugely commercial pictures.",
      "In 1985 the U.S. Film & Video Festival was struggling financially, and so Sundance took it over, eventually replacing the name with its own. Moved to Park City, the festival drew ever-increasing numbers of filmmakers, buyers, agents, publicists, journalists and fans to the tiny town. Beyond the festival, industry professionals would mentor young filmmakers in workshops and screenwriting labs. Wes Anderson's \"Bottle Rocket,\" Kimberly Peirce's \"Boys Don't Cry,\" Paul Thomas Anderson's \"Hard Eight,\" and Miranda July's \"Me and You and Everyone We Know\" were all developed in the Sundance Labs.",
      "In 1989 the festival blew up with the success of Stephen Soderbergh's \"sex, lies, and videotape,\" which won the Audience Award and was picked up by Miramax. Its subsequent theatrical release earned the low-budget dramedy a cool $25 million and an Oscar nomination.",
      "Since then, films and filmmakers who have broken out at the festival have included Quentin Tarantino (\"Reservoir Dogs\"), Robert Rodriguez (\"El Mariachi\"), Kevin Smith (\"Clerks\"), Christopher Nolan (\"Memento\"), Todd Solandz (\"Welcome to the Dollhouse\"), Ryan Coogler (\"Fruitvale Station\"), Damien Chazelle (\"Whiplash\"), Jordan Peele (\"Get Out\"), and the audience favorites \"Little Miss Sunshine,\" \"Beasts of the Southern Wild\" and \"The Blair Witch Project.\"",
      "Sundance also started a program to develop theatrical works, which has resulted in such productions as \"The Laramie Project,\" \"Light in the Piazza,\" and \"Angels in America.\"",
      "Not quite retiring",
      "In 2012 Redford was executive producer and narrator of the documentary \"Watershed,\" about the politics surrounding the Colorado River \u2014 the environmental and cultural damage from misuse of a vital natural resource. Asked by ThinkProgress whether his films can make a difference, Redford said, \"I've given up the idea that I can really change anything, and I just do the best I can. It's either that or do nothing, and we know that nothing doesn't work.\"",
      "The following year Redford starred in \"All Is Lost,\" playing a solo sailor facing disaster at sea when his small craft is crippled in an accident. He did much of the stunt work himself, in a \"storm-tossed\" water tank (the spray from fire hoses cost him partial hearing in one ear). He was hailed for his remarkable performance in which he uttered virtually no dialogue.",
      "\"All in all, it was worth it,\" he told the Salt Lake Tribune. \"I'm proud of the work. I felt it was a chance to do something at this point that was different and bold.\"",
      "Redford also added his name to the roster of Hollywood stars recruited for the Marvel Universe, appearing in \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\" and \"Avengers: Endgame\" as (spoiler alert) the leader of a plot against S.H.I.E.L.D. He also starred opposite Nick Nolte in \"A Walk in the Woods,\" played Dan Rather in \"Truth,\" and appeared opposite an animated creature in the Disney film \"Pete's Dragon.\" He also reteamed with Jane Fonda in the romance \"Our Souls at Night,\" their fourth film together.",
      "In 2018 he starred in \"The Old Man & the Gun,\" as an aging bank robber on the run. Redford told \"Sunday Morning\" that he connected very easily with the protagonist as an outlaw: \"I think probably I must've been born with an outlaw sensibility, in terms of my nature, yeah. Because from the time I was just a little kid, I was always wanting to go away from the rules. I wanted to \u2014 I didn't want to break any, I just didn't want to be held by them. In kindergarten, I ran away three times!\"",
      "With the film's release he announced he would be retiring from acting \u2014 but he remained active with voice work and producing documentaries.",
      "In addition to his Oscar win for \"Ordinary People,\" Redford was nominated for directing and producing \"Quiz Show,\" and in 2002 he received an honorary Academy Award for his impact on the industry. Three years later he was named a Kennedy Center honoree. At the Washington ceremony, Paul Newman ribbed Redford, referring to his reputation for lateness: \"Backstage they think the only reason he's even in the vicinity was because they told him this whole thing was yesterday.\"",
      "In 2016 Redford received the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The citation read: \"His art and activism continue to shape our nation's cultural heritage, inspiring millions to laugh, cry, think, and change.\" At the presentation ceremony, President Barack Obama remarked, \"As an actor, director, producer, and as an advocate, he has not stopped \u2014 and apparently drives so fast that he had breakfast in Napa and dinner in Salt Lake.\"",
      "Redford was married to Lola Van Wagenen in 1958; they divorced in 1995. They had four children: Scott, who died at age 2 months from sudden infant death syndrome; Shauna, an artist; James (Jamie), a filmmaker and environmental activist, who died of cancer in 2020; and Amy, a director.",
      "In 2009, Redford married artist and environmental activist Sibylle Szaggars.",
      "In 2018, the private Redford reflected to \"Sunday Morning\" on a favorite saying by T.S. Eliot: \"'There's only the trying. The rest is not our business.' It's one of my favorite phrases. Because you can't guarantee where the trying is going to get you. So, you can't guarantee the result. The only thing there is in its place is the trying. That's where the action is.\"",

Some of North America's most popular comedians, along with comics from Europe and elsewhere, are featured on the bill, including Dave Chapelle, Kevin Hart and Bill Burr.",
      "The festival will be the latest in a series of sports and cultural events hosted by Saudi Arabia's government that critics say amount to an effort to obscure the country's reputation for rampant human rights abuses.",
      "\"The Saudi government has invested billions into high profile entertainment events like these in a deliberate effort to whitewash the country's human rights record and deflect from the egregious abuses that continue to happen inside of the country,\" Human Rights Watch researcher Joey Shea told CBS News. \"These investments are a part of the broader strategy to... have people thinking about a comedy event, for example, rather than the soaring number of executions that are happening inside of the country.\"",
      "HRW noted specifically the state execution of journalist Turki Al-Jasser, who was killed in June following seven years of detention after reportedly being identified as the author of several anonymous tweets criticizing the Saudi royal family.",
      "Al-Jasser had been convicted of terrorism and high treason on the basis of posts he was accused of authoring, according to UNESCO.",

      "Reporters Without Borders, an organization that works to protect journalists, branded the charges against Al-Jasser as \"false.\"",
      "\"This execution of a journalist went forward to very little international criticism and this is clearly a result of these billions that had been invested in the country's whitewashing strategy,\" Shea told CBS News.",
      "When asked whether they believed the comedians would be able to freely tell jokes at the festival, the HRW researcher predicted there would be clear red lines drawn by organizers to prevent any criticism of Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman, who has already taken over as ruler of the highly conservative Islamic kingdom, as well as his policies and the broader royal family.",
      "Shea called on the high-profile entertainers attending the event \u2014 funding for which comes from the Saudi government's General Entertainment Authority \u2014   to mitigate the positive effect that their presence might have on the country's reputation for human rights abuses, including by \"speaking out about the abuses.\"",

Kennedy Jr.",

      "The change could mark a substantial crackdown on the H-1B program.

      "H-1B visas are already expensive, with the cost ranging from about $1,700 to $4,500, depending on whether the visa is expedited. The fees are typically considered a business expense for the employer.",
      "The new fee comes amid a debate over the H-1B visa, which some critics say enables companies to hire foreign applicants at lower salaries than American workers. Some employers also award H-1Bs for entry-level roles rather than for senior positions with greater skill requirements, detractors of the program say.",
      "Tech companies have been among the primary beneficiaries of the visa program. Amazon received the\u00a0most H1-B visas\u00a0of any business in 2024, Department of Labor data shows. This year, the online retailer remains the leading recipient of the visas, with more than 10,000 awarded, followed by Tata Consultancy, Microsoft, Apple and Google.",
      "\"This will ensure that the people they're bringing in are actually very highly skilled and that they're not replaceable by American workers. So it'll protect American workers, but ensure that companies have a pathway to hire truly extraordinary people and bring them to the United States,\" a White House aide said.",
      "Still, Stuart Anderson, executive director of the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan research group, said the plan could backfire if it incentivizes U.S. companies to shift jobs overseas, especially in specialized areas like research and development.",
      "\"The second impact will further decrease the number of international students who have an interest in coming to study in the U.S. If there's no opportunity work in the U.S., it's much less likely they'll enroll in U.S. programs,\" Anderson told CBS News.",
      "Last year, the most popular type of job for H-1B visas was software developer. To receive an H-1B visa, which is awarded by lottery, an applicant needs to have at least a bachelor's degree in their field and have been offered a temporary job by a U.S. company.",
      "President Trump plans to order the Labor Secretary to start a new rule-making process that would update wage levels for the program, Bloomberg reported. Currently, U.S. companies must offer the prevailing wage or the actual wage of similarly qualified workers, whichever is higher, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.",
      "The program is capped at 65,000 new visas each year, although an additional 20,000 can be issued for employees with a master's degree or higher, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The cap and higher-degree exemption quota is already filled for fiscal year 2026, according to the USCIS.",
      "The H-1B program is already the most restrictive visa program in the U.S., with about 20% of applications resulting in approved workers, according to a March\u00a0study\u00a0from the nonpartisan National Foundation for American Policy.",

    "published": "Fri, 19 Sep 2025 18:20:31 -0400",
    "summary": "TikTok's algorithm is the \"secret sauce\" behind the app's success, experts say. U.S.-China talks over the app's ownership must resolve who controls the technology.",
    "story": [
      "A deal in the works between the U.S. and China over the ownership of TikTok could include a licensing agreement for the closely guarded secret of the social media company's algorithm, to which access has proved a major sticking point in negotiations between the countries.",
      "The Chinese government once vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm, the technology that seems to intuit user preferences almost instantaneously and that has been a driving force for the video-sharing app's explosive growth in recent years.",
      "Previously, TikTok had also seemed unwilling to budge. In May, when the platform was challenging a 2024 law banning TikTok in the U.S., the company said in a legal filing that \"divesting TikTok Inc.'s U.S. business and completely severing it from the globally integrated platform of which it is a part is not commercially, technologically, or legally feasible.\"",
      "President Trump this week\u00a0again pushed back enforcement of the TikTok law, which would require its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, to sell its stake in the app or be cut off from the U.S. market. In the meantime, an agreement between the U.S. and China appears to be moving forward. Mr. Trump on Friday said he and Chinese President Xi Jinping have\u00a0\"made progress\" in talks over a potential deal to resolve the dispute over TikTok's ownership.",
      "Although key elements of the framework deal remain unclear, when some details were released earlier this week, Wang Jingtao, deputy director of China's Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, told reporters in Madrid that the arrangement included agreement over \"the use of intellectual property rights,\" according the Associated Press.",
      "William Akoto, an assistant professor at American University, thinks ByteDance executives may be urging the Chinese government to strike a deal so the company can continue earning revenue from the algorithm, while maintaining a foothold in the U.S.",
      "ByteDance and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "How would a TikTok licensing deal work?",
      "Mr. Trump, asked Thursday about what will happen with TikTok's algorithm, said, \"TikTok has tremendous value. The United States has that value in its hand since we're the ones that have to approve it.\"",
      "Chinese law\u00a0prohibits the export of TikTok's proprietary algorithm, including to the U.S., without government approval, according to experts. So exactly how a licensing deal would work remains unclear, including whether ByteDance could maintain any sort of outside control over TikTok's algorithm once ownership transfers to U.S. owners.",
      "\"What I understand is they would give a U.S. entity legal permission to use it under certain terms,\" said Sarah Kreps, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, a nonpartisan policy research organization. \"So it would be like they're renting the algorithm rather than selling it.\"",
      "Kreps added that in retaining a measure of ownership over the algorithm, ByteDance could have the right to access internal TikTok metrics and influence how content is ranked in the U.S., akin to how a software vendor can patch or upgrade licensed software.",
      "The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter,\u00a0said\u00a0this week that TikTok would create a new U.S. app and that the company's engineers would re-create content-recommendation algorithms using technology licensed from ByteDance.",
      "A White House spokesperson declined to comment on the contours of the U.S.-China framework deal over TikTok. \"Any details of the TikTok framework are pure speculation unless they are announced by this administration,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "What makes TikTok's algorithm special?",
      "Algorithms are complex data systems that act as recommendation engines, ranking the content users ultimately see in their feeds. They also help companies gather information about their customers in order to serve them targeted advertisements, a key source of revenue.",
      "Like other social media players, TikTok's algorithm delivers content to users based on their interests and interactions on the platform. Lauryn Williams, a deputy director and senior fellow focused on technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, described the algorithm as TikTok's \"secret sauce.\"",
      "Kreps highlights the algorithm's ability to quickly pick up on user behavior, interests and preferences. \"There's something about it that is so well-tailored to what they understand people to want that it gets them on the platform and keeps them there in ways that don't seem to be the case with other platforms,\" she said.",
      "In its own explanation of how it recommends videos, TikTok says it considers a range of factors, such as how long someone stays on a video and personal user information, such as someone's language preference or country of origin. The algorithm then \"selects from a large collection of eligible content and ranks them based on the system's prediction of how likely you'll be interested in each one.\"",
      "A Supreme Court ruling\u00a0from January\u00a0upholding the TikTok ban\u00a0notes\u00a0that each interaction a user has on TikTok \u2014 whether watching a video, following an account or leaving a comment \u2014 enables the recommendation system to \"further tailor a personalized content feed.\"",
      "National security concerns",
      "In Madrid, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said on Monday that \"we want to ensure that the Chinese have a fair, invested environment in the United States, but always that U.S. national security comes first,\"\u00a0according\u00a0to CNN.",
      "But while a deal between the U.S. and China could address the ownership dispute, it might not resolve all of the national security concerns that led Congress to pass the TikTok ban with bipartisan support in April of 2024, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Justice Department last year accused TikTok of collecting sensitive data about U.S. users, warning that the Chinese government could use the information to manipulate the content that people see. It also said TikTok employees were able to communicate directly with ByteDance engineers in China via an internal messaging system called Lark.",
      "In 2022, TikTok acknowledged in a letter to U.S. senators that China-based employees could have access to American users' data in certain circumstances and said it was taking steps to strengthen data security.",
      "In its\u00a0decision to uphold the TikTok ban in January, the Supreme Court also noted that China can require TikTok's parent company \"to cooperate with [its] efforts to obtain personal data,\" and that \"there is little to stop all that information from ending up in the hands of a designated foreign adversary.\"",
      "To minimize any national security concerns, Akoto, the American University assistant professor, said the new arrangement would have to ensure that the app's China-based engineers are unable to access the U.S. version of Tiktok. If the algorithm sends user data back to China or if the algorithm can be updated outside of the U.S, that could leave American users' data vulnerable, he said.",
      "When Jingtao, the deputy director of China's Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, spoke to the press earlier this week, he indicated the U.S. and China have agreed on entrusting a partner with handling U.S. user data and content security, although its unclear how exactly that would work.",

      "Food prices grew by half a percent from July to August, marking the fastest monthly rate of change since the fall of 2022. Behind the rising cost of food items on store shelves are three main culprits, according to experts.",
      "The Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs, climate change and a shortage of agricultural workers in the U.S. are the leading causes of grocery inflation, Phil Lempert, a food industry analyst also known as the \"Supermarket Guru,\" told CBS News correspondent Jo Ling Kent.",
      "Price hikes, he added, have been steepest on goods that the U.S. imports from nations facing higher levies. For example, the U.S. imports about 35% of its coffee from Brazil, whose exports are taxed at a rate of 50%.",
      "The latest Consumer Price Index data shows that coffee prices rose 21% in August compared with a year ago.",
      "As companies see their costs rise, they pass along those burdens to consumers. In the case of tariffs, some businesses began raising prices on products even before the levies were in full force.",
      "\"There's no question that what we've seen is, we're seeing companies increased prices because of the impending tariffs,\" said Lempert.",
      "\"What they want to do is they want to protect themselves. A lot of these big food companies are public companies. So what they've gotta do is they've gotta report back to their shareholders on profit margins. So they've been hedging their bets,\" Lempert said.",
      "Sometimes, packaged-goods companies disguise price hikes by offering consumers less product for the same amount of money. The covert inflation strategy has been dubbed \"shrinkflation,\" Lempert explained.",

      "Climate change",
      "Increasing temperatures and\u00a0shifts in weather patterns have made conditions for growing some fruits and vegetables in the U.S. inhospitable. As a result, a lot of domestic production has been moved to Central and Latin America, according to Lempert.",
      "\"We can't grow our food where we used to grow it,\" he said.",
      "Labor shortage",
      "Additionally, Mr. Trump's immigration policies, including raids on workplaces that employ large numbers of immigrants, plus waning interest in agricultural work, have led to an industrywide labor shortage, Lempert explained.",
      "Consumers are reacting to higher prices by looking for deals, purchasing store brand goods instead of name-brands and buying shelf-stable groceries in bulk at shopping clubs like Costco.",
      "Lempert said a little planning can go a long way to ensure that consumers can buy what they need.",
      "\"The number one thing that people want to do if they want to save money \u2014 stop wasting food,\" Lempert said.",
      "\"Forty percent of all of our food in this country is wasted. A lot of that's in our homes. So, take doggy bags from restaurants, use leftovers, freeze leftovers, don't waste food and you'll save a substantial amount of money,\" he said.",

      "\"Tariffs have a huge impact on grocery prices,\" food industry analyst Phil Lempert, editor of SupermarketGuru, told CBS News.",
      "Lempert believes the Trump administration's tariffs are one of three primary reasons that Americans are seeing a rise in grocery prices, with the others being climate change and labor shortages.",
      "\"We can't grow our food where we used to grow it,\" Lempert said of the impact of climate change. \"... Now it's had to move to Central and Latin America... Number two is the labor shortage... And then third is our tariffs.\"",
      "One of the products that has seen some of the biggest price jumps is coffee, which has jumped 21.7% compared to one year ago, according to the CPI.",
      "\"We got 50% tariffs on coffee from Brazil, and we import about 35% of our coffee beans, unroasted, from Brazil,\" Lempert said. \"... Yes, coffee's going to get more expensive.\"",
      "He also says the U.S. should brace for shrinkflation \u2014 when food and product manufacturers keep prices the same, but reduce the size of items, meaning consumers are ultimately paying more for the same amount.",
      "A September 2024 analysis from Lending Tree found that about one-third of approximately 100 common consumer products had shrunk in size or servings since the start of the pandemic.",
      "As an example, Lempert showed CBS News coffee bean packets in one grocery store in Santa Monica, California, that used to be sold in 16-ounce sizes, but are now 10.5 ounces.",
      "\"What they're doing is they're trying to put less in the package, hoping that you and I are not going to observe that, and keep that price either stable or just slightly increased,\" Lempert explained.",
      "Lempert says shrinkflation is \"absolutely not\" going away. According to his analysis, higher prices are changing consumer behavior, with more shoppers choosing less expensive store brands, shopping at multiple stores in an effort to find deals, and buying in bulk.",
      "\"No. 1, always have a shopping list,\" says Lempert on his advice on seeking out savings. \"... Don't waste food... Take doggy bags from restaurants, use leftovers, freeze leftovers. And then, obviously, use your coupons. Use your frequent shopper card. Do everything you can to compare prices before you head to the store.\"",

    "story": [
      "Hyundai Motor Group on Thursday confirmed it is going forward with previously announced plans to expand its Georgia plant, just weeks after an immigration raid delayed the startup of an electric vehicle battery plant at the site.",
      "As part of a broader investment strategy, Hyundai said it would spend $2.7 billion to increase production capacity at the Ellabell site by 200,000 over the next three years, to a total of 500,000 vehicles a year.",
      "The company first announced the expansion in March at the grand opening of the plant west of Savannah, and had said in August that it would invest an additional $5 billion in the United States overall. But the raid, which included arrests of more than 300 South Korean citizens, led to questions about the wisdom of the Asian nation investing in the U.S.",
      "The company said it now plans to produce 10 models of electric and hybrid gas-electric vehicles in Georgia, up from the current two the plant has been assembling as it ramps up production. Hyundai says it's still on track to expand production worldwide to 5.6 million vehicles a year by 2030. The automaker pledged that 60% of those vehicles will be electric or hybrid powered, targeting sales in South Korea, North America and Europe.",
      "Hyundai said that it plans to make more than 80% of vehicles sold in the United States domestically by 2030, with total domestic content increasing from 60% to 80%. For the first time, the vehicles would include a mid-sized pickup truck, a key vehicle class in the U.S. market. The company already makes the Santa Cruz model, a four-door compact pickup, that it started selling in 2021.",
      "Hyundai CEO Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz has said the immigration raid will delay opening\u00a0the battery plant by at least two to three months. Spokesperson Michael Stewart said Thursday that the facility will open in the first half of 2026.",
      "Both Hyundai executives and Georgia officials have been trying to calm the situation since the raid, which mushroomed into a diplomatic dispute between South Korea and the United States.",
      "Republican Gov. Brian Kemp told reporters Tuesday at a ceremony marking the groundbreaking of a Rivian Automotive electric vehicle plant that he remains confident Georgia's business advantages would \"win out\" in terms of foreign investment. The raid may even wind up smoothing the way for South Korean employees to more easily obtain legal permission to help build and operate facilities in the United States, he said.",
      "\"I've had good conversations with companies that are here doing business in Georgia, companies that are looking to do business here,\" Kemp said. \"And I've had good conversations with people in the White House about the visa issue.\"",
      "Brent Stubbs, the chief administrative officer of the Ellabell site, wrote in an opinion piece published Wednesday in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the company is still committed to Georgia.",
      "\"This situation doesn't change our plans to continue expanding and localizing in the United States,\" Stubbs wrote. \"Our investments in America are part of a long-term strategic plan.\"",
      "The $2.7 billion investment confirmed Thursday will go to expanding capacity at the plant and group affiliates, Stewart said. Hyundai and its onsite affiliates currently have 3,129 employees in Ellabell, he said.",
      "Hyundai and its joint-venture partner in the battery plant, LG Energy Solution, had previously announced $12.6 billion of investments at the Georgia site, with pledges to hire at least 8,500 workers by the end of 2031. State and local governments have promised $2.1 billion in tax breaks and other incentives.",
      "The boost at the Ellabell site is the biggest part Hyundai's plan to raise production by 1.2 million vehicles a year worldwide. That includes another 250,000 vehicles out of Pune, India; and 200,000 more at Hyundai's electric vehicle plant in Ulsan, South Korea. The automaker said it would also deliver parts for assembly into an additional 250,000 vehicles at plants in Saudi Arabia, Vietnam and North Africa.",
      "Hyundai underlined a previous announcement to deepen its investment in robotics and said that by 2027 it would launch extended-range electric vehicles with gasoline motors to extend the range of its electric batteries to more than 600 miles (960 kilometers).",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-interest-rate-cut-september-2025-rates-loans-mortgages/",
    "published": "Thu, 18 Sep 2025 13:27:19 -0400",
    "summary": "The Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut since December could be followed by more reductions later in 2025. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday delivered its first rate cut since December, a move that will ripple through everything from home loans to credit cards, although not all Americans will notice the change in the same way.",
      "The Fed cut reduces its federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 by one-quarter point, shaving its target range to between 4% and 4.25%, down from its prior range of 4.25% to 4.5%.",
      "Though incremental, the policy turn is significant. Fed officials foresee two additional cuts in 2025 and one more in 2026, a trajectory that could lower rates by a full percentage point and lighten the load for millions of borrowers. For now, the quarter-point reduction will trickle through unevenly: some borrowers will see relief almost immediately, while others may notice little change, depending on their rates and the products they hold, according to experts.",
      "\"Any reduction is welcome, and especially if this is the first of several to come, which it sounds like it might be,\"Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree, said in a statement. \"That's a positive thing.\"",
      "One area where Schulz doesn't expect consumers to see significant change is on credit card rates. While banks will lower their annual percentage rates in response to the cut, it's probably not going to make much of a dent for people who carry a balance, given that the average APR currently stands at about 20%.",
      "\"That quarter point isn't going to make that much of a difference,\" Schulz said.",
      "Here's where you're most likely to feel an immediate impact from the Fed's reduction \u2014 for better and worse.",
      "Home equity line of credit",
      "A home equity line of credit (HELOC) represents one of the financial products where the Fed rate cut could provide a bigger bang for borrowers' bucks.",
      "A HELOC is a line of credit based on the value of your home. In some ways, it is similar to a credit card, because it provides a maximum credit line that borrowers can draw down and their interest rates are variable \u2014 which means they rise and fall based on the prime rate, which in turn is influenced by the fed funds rate.",
      "If you have a HELOC, you can expect your rate to decline by one-quarter point within a month or two, according to Bankrate. The average HELOC today has a rate of about 8.05%, the financial site notes.",
      "\"HELOCs are one of the types of loans that tend to be directly impacted, so if you do have a HELOC, that quarter-point reduction can be pretty significant,\" Schulz said.",
      "According to CBS News' Managing Your Money, that 0.25 percentage-point reduction could trim a borrowers' costs on a $100,000 HELOC by about $173 annually. Bigger savings could be in store if the Fed carries through with additional rate cuts later this year and in early 2026.",
      "Mortgages",
      "House hunters enjoyed a preemptive benefit from the Fed rate cut, as mortgage rates have declined this month in anticipation of lower rates.",
      "Average rates for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.35%\u00a0this week, its lowest level in nearly a year. Just two years ago, mortgages approached 8%, hitting their\u00a0highest levels since 2000.",
      "Mortgage rates aren't set by the Fed, but they're heavily influenced by its policy moves, as well as bond market investors' expectations for economic growth and inflation.",
      "\"It's not just about what the Fed is doing today, it's about what they're expected to do in the future, and that's determined by things like economic growth, what's going to happen in the labor market and what do we think inflation is going to be like over the next year or so,\" Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, told AP News.",
      "While additional rate cuts later this year aren't guaranteed to result in lower home loan rates, it's a possibility, said Stephen Kates, financial analyst at Bankrate.",
      "\"It means that they probably could go down more, and they may trend in that direction, even if they don't move in lockstep,\" he added.",
      "High-interest savings accounts",
      "Unfortunately, the Fed's rate cut could have a negative impact on one group: Savers.",
      "Since the Fed started hiking rates in 2022 to battle soaring inflation, high-interest savings accounts and certificates of deposit have been the silver lining for consumers. People who had money to sock away in one of those accounts or a CD could get rates as high as 5% in 2024.",
      "Currently, savers can still find high-interest savings accounts offering 4%, but those might drop soon as banks adjust their offers to reflect the Fed's rate reduction, Schulz said.",
      "\"Expect yields on high-interest savings accounts and CDs to drop. Savers may want to act now by locking in today's still-high rates before they fall further,\" he noted.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Thursday to allow President Trump to remove Lisa Cook from her position on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors while a legal challenge to her firing moves forward.",
      "In its request for emergency relief from the high court, the Justice Department said that the justices should freeze a lower court decision that ordered Cook to be reinstated to her post on the Fed Board.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled earlier this week that Cook could remain\u00a0in her role while a legal challenge to her firing moves forward.",
      "Mr. Trump's emergency appeal to the high court comes after Cook participated in a two-day meeting of the Fed's committee that sets interest rates this week. The central bank on Wednesday lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, its first cut since December. The president has repeatedly criticized the Fed for moving too slowly to lower interest rates.",
      "\"That the Federal Reserve Board plays a uniquely important role in the American economy only heightens the government's and the public's interest in ensuring that an ethically compromised member does not continue wielding its vast powers,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in the request to the Supreme Court. \"Put simply, the President may reasonably determine that interest rates paid by the American people should not be set by a Governor who appears to have lied about facts material to the interest rates she secured for herself \u2014 and refuses to explain the apparent misrepresentations.\"",
      "Lisa Cook's firing",
      "Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook last month over allegations she made misrepresentations on mortgage filings. She has not been charged with any crime and denies wrongdoing. Cook's removal by Mr. Trump was unprecedented \u2014 no president has attempted to remove a Fed governor in the central bank's 112-year-history. Critics warned that it threatened the independence of the Fed.",
      "Cook swiftly filed a lawsuit against the administration, arguing her removal violated the Federal Reserve Act. The law specifies that a president can only remove a governor \"for cause.\" Cook also argued her due process rights were violated because she was not provided notice of the allegations against her and a meaningful opportunity to respond.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb sided with Cook earlier this month, finding that her firing likely violated the Federal Reserve Act and her right to due process under the Fifth Amendment. She ordered Cook to be reinstated to her post on the Fed Board.",
      "The Trump administration sought emergency relief from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which left Cobb's order intact. Judge Bradley Garcia wrote in a concurring opinion that Cook is likely to succeed in her claim that Mr. Trump's attempt to terminate her violated her due process rights. But he wrote that the court did not need to address the meaning of \"for cause\" at this stage in the case.",
      "The White House had said the administration would seek the Supreme Court's intervention, as it has done in several other legal challenges to Mr. Trump's efforts to remove Democratic-appointed officials at independent agencies. The high court has so far allowed the president to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board and Consumer Product Safety Commission, but it acknowledged in May that the Fed is a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",
      "In his filing, Sauer argued that Cook received adequate notice and opportunity to contest her removal.",
      "\"The President notified Cook of the charges against her and waited five days for her to respond before removing her,\" he wrote. \"Having declined to bring any defense to the President's attention or to dispute any material facts, Cook cannot complain about insufficient process.\"",
      "The solicitor general noted that the administration is not contesting the constitutionality of the for-cause removal protection for members of the Fed Board, but instead believes the president's firing of Cook complies with it. Still, Sauer said the district court's finding that conduct that occurred before Cook was appointed to the Fed does not constitute \"cause\" under the Federal Reserve Act\u00a0 was \"flawed.\"",
      "\"The President's strong concerns about the appearance of mortgage fraud, based on facially contradictory representations made to obtain mortgages by someone whose job is to set interest rates that affect Americans' mortgages, satisfies any conception of cause,\" he wrote. \"That is especially true here, where Cook has not disputed any material fact or offered any plausible justification for her conduct.\"",
      "Mr. Trump announced last month that he was\u00a0firing Cook, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, from the Fed Board of Governors and had \"sufficient cause\" to oust her. Cook's 14-year-term on the Fed is set to end in January 2038.",
      "The president cited as grounds for her removal claims made by Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, that Cook made false statements on mortgage documents.",
      "Pulte alleged in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi last month that Cook claimed two different properties in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Atlanta as her principal residence on mortgage documents from 2021 in order to gain more favorable lending terms. Pulte, who was appointed to lead the FHFA by Mr. Trump, has continued to make accusations against Cook related to mortgage documents.",
      "Cook's lawyers have said she \"did not ever commit mortgage fraud.\" Documents obtained by The Associated Press this week showed that Cook referred to the property as a \"vacation home\" in a loan estimate, potentially undercutting the Trump administration's claims of fraud.",

      "Nvidia said it will spend $5 billion to buy Intel common stock at $23.28 a share. The investment, which is subject to regulatory approvals, comes a month after the U.S. government took a 10% stake in Intel.",

      "\"This is a game-changer deal for Intel as it now brings them front and center into the AI game,\" Ives said. \"Along with the recent U.S. government investment for 10% (equity stake in Intel) this has been a golden few weeks for Intel after years of pain and frustration for investors.\"",
      "Nvidia, meanwhile, has soared because its specialized chips are underpinning the artificial intelligence boom. The chips, known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, are highly effective at developing powerful AI systems.",

This week, Chinese officials reportedly forbade several large domestic technology companies from purchasing Nvidia chips, and Huawei announced that it was expanding its development of AI chips and manufacturing.",
      "While Nvidia and Intel will work together to develop new chips, a manufacturing deal has yet to be struck between the two.

    "story": [
      "Starbucks workers in three states took legal action against the coffee giant Wednesday, saying it violated the law when it changed its dress code but refused to reimburse employees who had to buy new clothes.",
      "The employees, who are backed by the union organizing Starbucks' workers, filed class-action lawsuits in state court in Illinois and Colorado. Workers also filed complaints with California's Labor and Workforce Development Agency. If the agency decides not to seek penalties against Starbucks, the workers intend to file a class-action lawsuit in California, according to the complaints.",
      "Starbucks didn't comment directly on them Wednesday, but the company said it simplified its dress code to deliver a more consistent experience to customers and give its employees clearer guidance.",
      "\"As part of this change, and to ensure out partners were prepared, partners received two shirts at no cost,\" the company said Wednesday. Starbucks refers to its employees as \"partners.\"",
      "The dress code sparked a strike at 75 U.S. stores in May soon after it went into effect, with more than 1,000 workers protesting the new policy, according to Starbucks Workers United, which represents workers at 640 of Starbucks' 10,000 company-owned U.S. stores. The union said the dress code should be subject to collective bargaining but isn't a party to the suits.",
      "The new dress code requires all workers in North America to wear a solid black shirt with short or long sleeves under their green aprons. Shirts may or may not have collars, but they must cover the midriff and armpits.",
      "Employees must wear khaki, black or blue denim bottoms without patterns or frayed hems or solid black dresses that are not more than 4 inches above the knee. The dress code also requires workers to wear black, gray, dark blue, brown, tan or white shoes made from a waterproof material. Socks and hosiery must be \"subdued,\" the company said.",
      "The dress code prohibits employees from having face tattoos or more than one facial piercing. Tongue piercings and \"theatrical makeup\" are also prohibited.",
      "Starbucks said in April that the new dress code would make employees' green aprons stand out and create a sense of familiarity for customers. It comes as the company is trying to reestablish a warmer, more welcoming experience in its stores.",
      "Before the new dress code was imposed, Starbucks had a relatively lax policy. In 2016, it began allowing employees to wear patterned shirts in a wider variety of colors to give them more opportunities for self-expression.",
      "The old dress code was also loosely enforced, according to the Colorado lawsuit. But under the new dress code, employees who don't comply aren't allowed to start their shifts.",
      "Brooke Allen, a full-time student who also works at a Starbucks in Davis, California, said she was told by a manager in July that the Crocs she was wearing didn't meet the new standards and she would have to wear different shoes if she wanted to work the following day. Allen had to go to three stores to find a compliant pair, which cost her $60.09.",
      "Allen has spent an additional $86.95 on clothes for work, including black shirts and jeans.",
      "\"I think it's extremely tone deaf on the company's part to expect their employees to completely redesign their wardrobe without any compensation,\" Allen said. \"A lot of us are already living paycheck to paycheck.\"",
      "Allen said she misses the old dress code, which allowed her to express herself with colorful shirts and three facial piercings.",
      "\"It looks sad now that everyone is wearing black,\" she said.",
      "The lawsuits and complaints filed Wednesday allege that Starbucks' dress code violates state laws that require companies to reimburse workers for expenses that primarily benefit the employer. Colorado law also prohibits employers from imposing expenses on workers without their written consent, according to that lawsuit. The plaintiffs seek damages on behalf of all Starbucks workers in those states, whether or not their stores are unionized.",
      "Multiple plaintiffs, like Allen, said they requested reimbursement from Starbucks to conform to the dress code but were denied. Gilbert Cruz, an employee in Aurora, Illinois, requested $10 for the cost of removing a nose piercing.",
      "Worker-led lawsuits in state courts are a shift in tactics in the multi-year effort to unionize Starbucks' stores.",

    "summary": "The Federal Reserve is cutting its benchmark interest rate as the U.S. economy faces headwinds, including a faltering labor market.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points \u2014 its first cut since December \u2014 as the U.S. grapples with a stalling labor market and slower economic growth.",
      "The Fed cut reduces the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 to between 4% and 4.25%, down from its prior range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The last time the central bank eased borrowing costs was in December 2024, when it also trimmed rates by a quarter of a percentage point.",
      "Federal Reserve officials are also penciling in two more rate cuts in 2025, but only one in 2026, according to the central bank's summary of economic projections. That may disappoint Wall Street, with investors before the meeting projecting a total of five cuts over the rest of the year and 2026.",
      "According to those median\u00a0projections, Fed officials expect the nation's unemployment rate, currently 4.3%, to reach 4.5% by year-end before ticking down to 4.4% in 2026 and 4.3% the following year.",
      "Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) \u2014 the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation \u2014 is forecast to level off at 3% this year, well above the central bank's 2% annual target, before receding to 2.6% next year and 2.1% in 2027. The median projections for core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, forecast PCE of 3.1% this year.",
      "The move comes as the Fed contends with a two-fold economic challenge: curbing inflation, which has flared in recent months, while supporting job growth, which has slumped. The Fed typically seeks to tame inflation by nudging up interest rates to slow economic growth, while cutting rates in periods when the economy is faltering to encourage consumer spending and business investment.",
      "\"In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen,\" Powell said in a press conference following the Fed's two-day meeting.",
      "He added that recent labor data shows that what he termed \"people at the margins,\" which he said include recent college grads, are now having a harder time finding employment.",
      "\"The overall job-finding rate is very, very low, but the layoff rate is also very low,\" Powell noted. \"The concern is that if you start to see layoffs, the people who are laid off, there won't be a lot of hiring going on.\"",
      "In acting to lower interest rates, the Fed is signaling that it views the slowing labor market as a more pressing concern than rising prices, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell underlined at his\u00a0Jackson Hole address\u00a0last month in Wyoming.",
      "\"Concerns for the labor market's health are rising,\" said Cory Stahle, economist in the Indeed Hiring Lab, in a statement after the Fed's decision. \"Unemployment and layoffs are relatively stable at historically low levels, which is encouraging, but they are unlikely to stay that way if labor market conditions deteriorate further.\"",
      "At the same time, Powell said the Fed now views the pass-through of the Trump administration's tariff as being \"smaller and slower\" than central bank officials had expected earlier this year. \"We continue to expect [inflation] to move up, maybe not as much as we would have a few months ago,\" he said.",
      "The rate cut comes amid intense political pressure on the Fed, with President Trump repeatedly accusing Powell of moving too slowly to ease borrowing costs and shore up economic activity.",
      "Mr. Trump is also seeking to put his imprint on the Fed. To that end, he has\u00a0sought to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook from her seat on the central bank's board, alleging that she engaged in mortgage fraud. She has denied committing fraud and challenged Mr. Trump's authority to fire her, with an appeals court ruling Monday that Cook can keep her job.",
      "One vote for a jumbo cut",
      "An economic adviser to Mr. Trump, Stephen Miran, was\u00a0confirmed by the Senate\u00a0on Monday to take an open spot on the Fed's Board of Governors. He will also sit on the 12-member Federal Open Markets Committee, or FOMC, which sets interest rates for the Fed.",
      "\"Stephen Miran was a last-minute addition to the FOMC, but his vote won't drastically alter the outcome. He joined too late to submit an economic projection and path for monetary policy,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a report this week ahead of the Fed's rate cut.",
      "All of the voting FOMC members except one \u2014 Miran \u2014 voted in favor of the quarter-point cut, according to the central bank's statement. Miran voted for a larger cut of 0.50 percentage points, the Fed noted.",
      "A key question for consumers and businesses is whether the Fed trimming borrowing costs for the first time in nearly a year augurs additional cuts in 2025 and heading into 2026. Fed officials have two more meetings this year, set for October and December.",
      "Although the FOMC members were largely united on the size of today's cut, their projections of future cuts show a difference of opinion about the path of monetary policy moving forward. Many of the group's members don't expect the panel to make any more cuts this year, according to the summary of economic projections.",
      "\"That median hides the deep split on the FOMC \u2013\u2013 nine of 19 members don't anticipate further cuts this year,\" Michael Pearce, deputy chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a report.",
      "Powell noted that a quarter-point cut isn't likely to make a huge difference to the economy, but added, \"You have to look at the path\" of future cuts expected later this year and in 2026. \"It starts with a 25 basis point cut \u2014 it's not just one action,\" he said.",

      "Average homeowners insurance costs have risen nearly 70% over the past five years, according\u00a0to data from ICE Mortgage Technology. On average, single-family homeowners with a mortgage now pay $2,370 a year for their property policy. In 2025, homeowners insurance costs rose have risen most sharply in California, where premiums in Los Angeles were up 19.5% compared to a year ago, according to the loan analytics firm.",
      "Soaring homeowners insurance rates are leading some Americans to switch insurers, or do without coverage altogether \u2014 a risky step that can prove financially ruinous and that experts strongly discourage.",
      "\"All things being equal, if you raise prices customers aren't happy,\" J.D. Power managing director Craig Martin told CBS MoneyWatch. \"As premiums increase, it starts to impact how people perceive insurance, and they start to wonder if their insurer cares about them or their profits.\"",
      "Property insurance premiums vary by geography, and are typically higher in places where residents are more vulnerable to disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires that scientists link to climate change, according to insurance experts.",
      "\"The price of insurance is increasing as the level of risk increases,\" said Sean Kevelighan, CEO of the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group that provides information to consumers. \"We are beginning to see some trends of Americans making tougher decisions about their insurance.\"",
      "According to a recent Realtor.com survey of homeowners, nearly 60% of respondents said they might forgo purchasing property coverage if it becomes too expensive.",
      "\"Households are feeling squeezed, and more are considering going without home insurance altogether,\" Realtor.com economic data analyst Hannah Jones told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "What's behind rising premiums?",
      "Several factors have led to the surge in property insurance costs:\u00a0higher home values, mounting climate-related risks, and the higher cost of lumber, steel and other building materials, insurance experts said. In June, the median home sale price in the U.S. hit a record high of nearly $400,000, according to online real estate firm Redfin.",
      "\"We've seen costs related to construction materials rise, and the price of insurance is a reflection of risk, plus the cost to pay a claim,\" Kevelighan said.",
      "\"It's a double whammy,\" Jones added. \"If your home is worth more, it costs more to insure, and also your home is more at risk, so you stand to lose more if you go without insurance.\"",
      "\"We don't recommend going without insurance because it leaves you extremely exposed in case you do suffer property damage, or a complete loss of property,\" she said.",
      "However, homeowners do have alternatives when it comes to choosing an insurer, while there are steps they can take to try to minimize their coverage costs.",
      "\"A few of these things are under people's control,\" NerdWallet homeowners insurance expert Holden Lewis told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you are in a place where there are a lot of wildfires, you can change your landscaping so you don't have flammable materials, for example.\"",
      "A home that's perceived as less vulnerable is less costly to insure, he explained.",

    "summary": "The IRS adjusts its tax provisions for inflation every year, which can help taxpayers avoid so-called \"bracket creep.\"",
    "story": [
      "Americans could get some financial relief next year when the IRS adjusts its federal income tax brackets for inflation, a change that could help lower taxes for millions of households.",
      "Each fall \u2014 typically in October or November \u2014 the IRS announces inflation adjustments that affects everything from the tax brackets people are subject to based on their income to the size of the standard deduction. Some experts are already projecting those changes by analyzing the same inflation data the tax agency uses as part its annual reset.",
      "Based on that analysis, the IRS is likely to apply an inflation rate of 2.7% in adjusting its brackets and other items, according to Bloomberg Tax. It based its projection on chained Consumer Price Index data for the past 12 months.",
      "Separately, the bottom two tax brackets will see a bigger adjustment next year because of the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending law, which applies a more generous inflation bump for those bands. Those brackets will see a roughly 4% increase in their income thresholds next year, Bloomberg Tax calculated.",
      "The IRS tweaks those thresholds to avoid so-called \"bracket creep,\" which can occur if the bands fail to keep up with inflation. Without those annual adjustments, workers who get a cost-of-living pay increase could be pushed into a higher tax bracket even though their standard of living hasn't changed.",
      "\"If they didn't do it year after year, for example with the standard deduction, it would become less and less meaningful each year for taxpayers,\" Amber Gorski, an analyst at Bloomberg Tax and Accounting, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In other words, you'll have to earn more income next year to reach each higher band of taxation. For instance, a single taxpayer who earns $50,000 in 2025 would have a top tax rate of 22%, but in 2026 their highest marginal rate would be 12%, according to Bloomberg's projections.",
      "How the adjustments could impact you",
      "Some Americans could see a tax break due to the higher thresholds for each bracket.",
      "\"Going into 2026, they could use that information to estimate what their tax return potentially is going to be, and what they might owe in taxes,\" Gorski said.",
      "On top of the higher income thresholds for 2026, some seniors and workers could also benefit from changes implemented under the \"big, beautiful\" bill. Those include an extra $6,000 senior deduction and the elimination of some taxes on tipped income and overtime pay for qualifying workers.",
      "The passage of the tax and spending bill in July ensures that next year's tax bracket rates will remain the same. That means the individual tax rates will remain at 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% and 37%, although the thresholds for each band will edge higher because of the inflation adjustments.",
      "Without the new tax law, enacted \u00a0by President Trump in July, the bracket rates would have reverted to their levels before the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Prior to that law, for instance, the highest individual income bracket stood at 39.6%.",
      "The IRS has based its annual inflation adjustments on the so-called\u00a0\"chained Consumer Price Index,\"\u00a0as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Bloomberg notes that some of its projections could vary slightly from the IRS' official announcement, which typically arrives in October.",
      "\"The IRS will issue authoritative guidance, as it usually does, sometime between mid-October and early November,\" an IRS spokesman told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "How tax brackets work",
      "There's a common misconception that your top tax rate is what you pay on the entire amount of your annual income, but that's incorrect. Each bracket represents the percentage you'll pay in taxes on each slice of income within that band.",
      "Take the example of the worker who earns $50,000 per year. In 2026, that taxpayer would pay 10% on the first $12,400 of earned income, and then 12% on any income above $12,401 and up to $50,400.",

    "summary": "The Department of Homeland Security is escalating its clash with so-called sanctuary states, warning multiple states they could face legal action, CBS News has learned.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Department of Homeland Security has escalated its clash with so-called sanctuary states this week, warning California, New York, and Illinois in letters obtained by CBS News that refusal to honor immigration detainers could trigger federal legal action.",
      "In letters dated Sept. 10, Acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons ordered the attorneys general of the three states to declare within two days whether they would comply with \"thousands of ICE detainers\" lodged against individuals in state custody, according to DHS. Immigration detainers are formal requests by ICE asking local jails and prisons to notify the agency before releasing an individual, and to hold them briefly so federal agents can take undocumented migrants into federal custody.",
      "According to DHS, Illinois and New York formally declined to cooperate. California did not respond. On Sept. 18, Lyons sent follow-up letters obtained by CBS News accusing each state of obstructing immigration enforcement and vowing to enlist the Department of Justice in response. Senior DHS officials tell CBS News the department will tap the DOJ to sue states, blocking future federal funding.",
      "In his follow-up letter to Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, Lyons wrote that the state's refusal \"will result in thousands of criminal aliens being released into Illinois communities,\" adding that \"ICE will engage with the U.S. Department of Justice and other federal partners to pursue all appropriate measures against you.\"",
      "Lyons wrote in his letter to California Attorney General Rob Bonta, \"I take this lack of response to mean that you will continue refusing to honor ICE detainers, resulting in thousands of criminal aliens being released into California communities.\"",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James received a similar warning after two aides to Gov. Kathy Hochul confirmed the state would not expand cooperation, according to DHS.",
      "CBS News has reached out to all three attorney general's offices for comment.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin wrote, \"These dangerous sanctuary policies, often combined with cashless bail for serious crimes, allow criminal illegal aliens to be released back into American communities \u2014 threatening the American people's lives and wellbeing.\"",
      "A DHS spokesperson tells CBS News that the agency has arrested roughly 400,000 undocumented immigrants since the start of the Trump administration, and 70% of those arrested by ICE have criminal charges or convictions.",
      "Among those released by state authorities include undocumented migrants charged with sex crimes on minors, multiple assaults on police officers with a dangerous weapon, indecent assault and battery, as well as those with drug trafficking and weapons charges, a DHS spokesperson said.",
      "Federal regulation dictates that immigration detainers instruct local jails and prisons to hold someone for up to 48 hours after their scheduled release so ICE can take custody. Historically, federal courts have ruled that these detainers are requests, with some local and state authorities outlawing compliance. Some courts have also found that holding people without a judge's warrant can raise constitutional challenges, citing the Fourth Amendment's protections against unlawful detention.",
      "California, New York, and Illinois have each passed laws limiting compliance with ICE detainers.",
      "California law bars local police from honoring detainers, except for individuals convicted of select serious crimes, while New York law restricts cooperation, requiring judicial warrants rather than administrative detainers to detain undocumented migrants. The New York attorney general's office advises local police departments not to honor ICE detainers unless they are accompanied by warrants issued by judges. Illinois' TRUST Act also prohibits state and local law enforcement from detaining individuals without a judicial warrant.",
      "Supporters of city- and state-level \"sanctuary\" laws typically argue the policies lead to greater trust between local police and residents whose immigration status may make them reluctant to cooperate with law enforcement or report crimes.",
      "But the Trump administration argues \"sanctuary\" policies make it harder for ICE to apprehend undocumented migrants, prompting the federal agency to send more law enforcement agents into American communities to conduct arrests on the streets. Those operations have drawn protests in major cities like New York City, Chicago and Los Angeles in recent months, leading to some clashes with ICE and several arrests.",
      "In recent months, the Justice Department and other agencies have sought to cut off grants to cities and states that limit their cooperation with federal immigration authorities, drawing lawsuits.",
      "In his warnings to state attorneys general, Lyons underscored that ICE prefers cooperation but will not allow what he calls \"inadvisable and irresponsible obstruction\" to continue, though he fell short of specifying exactly how the Justice Department will pursue lawsuits or other federal action in the coming weeks.",

    "summary": "Early in-person voting began Friday in Virginia's gubernatorial election, with Democrat Abigail Spanberger and Republican Winsome Earle-Sears making their case to voters.",
    "story": [
      "Early in-person voting began Friday in Virginia's gubernatorial election, marking one of the first major political contests since last year's presidential race, and a likely bellwether for President Trump's policies.",
      "The two contenders \u2014 Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears and former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger \u2014 held public appearances Friday to kick off the final stages of their respective campaigns, ahead of a Nov. 4 general election. Spanberger is favored in some recent polling.",
      "Spanberger cast her vote Friday morning at a polling station in West Henrico, near the capital of Richmond. Speaking to CBS News afterwards, the former congresswoman said her campaign is focusing on the issues impacting the day-to-day lives of Virginians.",
      "\"Whether it's because you just saw your rent go up, or you think you might want to buy your first house, or you're trying to pick up your prescription at the pharmacy for your kid, for your parents, for yourself, issues of affordability continue to be top of mind for people across Virginia,\" Spanberger told CBS News.",
      "Meanwhile, Earle-Sears Friday held a get-out-the-vote rally with Republican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Vivek Ramaswamy, an entrepreneur and former Republican presidential candidate who is running for governor of Ohio. She heavily cited Youngkin's economic record, tying herself to the popular term-limited governor.",
      "\"We've got a lot more work to do. We've got regulations that we still need to get rid of,\" Earle-Sears said at the rally. \"We've got more jobs that we need to produce.\"",
      "DOGE and Trump administration play key role",
      "National-level issues and the Trump administration's policies have taken center-stage.",
      "Virginia is one of two states to hold its gubernatorial election the year following a presidential cycle, along with New Jersey, so the race is often seen as a referendum on the current administration. And historically, Virginia has voted for a governor of the opposite political party from the one that controls the White House every time a new president has been elected since 1977 \u2014 a trend that Earle-Sears hopes to break.",
      "The Trump administration's sweeping cuts to the federal workforce \u2014 helmed by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE \u2014 could play an especially important role in Virginia. The state had almost 150,000 civilian federal workers as of last year, more than any other state aside from California, according to a Congressional Research Service report.",
      "Virginia lost 7,800 federal jobs in the first half of this year, and is forecasted to lose 9,300 government jobs \u2014 federal, state and local \u2014 by the end of 2025, the University of Virginia's Weldon Cooper Center estimated last month.",
      "Spanberger has positioned herself as a Trump foe, arguing her focus on affordability includes pushing back on the \"bad policy\" coming out of Washington and presenting plans that aim to mitigate the financial impact these policies have on Virginians.",
      "Earle-Sears has spoken favorably about Mr. Trump, though the president has remained noncommittal on whether he will campaign for the Republican gubernatorial hopeful. Asked about Earle-Sears and downballot Virginia GOP candidates on Friday, Mr. Trump said: \"I'm going to have to look at some of them. As you know, it's sort of a semi-local election.\"",
      "Spanberger has sought to tie her opponent to Mr. Trump and DOGE. She attacked Earle-Sears for campaigning alongside Ramaswamy, whom she described to CBS News on Friday as \"the architect of the DOGE effort, which has led to thousands of Virginians losing their jobs.\" After last year's election, Mr. Trump named Ramaswamy and Elon Musk co-leaders of DOGE, but Ramaswamy ultimately stepped away. Musk has since departed DOGE as well, which was followed by a public falling out with Mr. Trump.",
      "Asked about that criticism by CBS News, Earle-Sears called Spanberger a \"typical divisive politician\" and emphasized her and Youngkin's job creation record.",
      "\"We are going to make sure that Virginians are told if they want a job, we have a job,\" Earle-Sears said. \"We're continuing to create jobs.\"",
      "Earle-Sears, meanwhile, attacked Spanberger during Friday's rally for the Democrat's positions on immigration, including her promise to roll back some collaboration between Virginia authorities and federal immigration agents.",
      "Campaigning in the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination",
      "The gubernatorial campaign is entering its final stretch less than two weeks after the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a college campus debate in Utah, a jarring event that has raised new fears about the specter of political violence.",
      "The assassination has also sparked worries among politicians about their own security. A source close to the Earle-Sears campaign told CBS News the campaign increased its security at Friday's event.",
      "Spanberger told CBS News that Kirk's death was \"absolutely horrifying.\"",
      "\"The fact that a man engaged in a First Amendment debate, whether one agrees with him or not, the fact that he was gunned down in broad daylight because of his political activism is an atrocious reality that everyone should denounce,\" she said.",
      "Earle-Sears has also denounced the attack on Kirk: \"Just because he was using his First Amendment rights, he was gunned down,\" she said in a video on X.",

      "Under the Gold Card program, which Mr. Trump first floated in February, non-Americans who give a gift of at least $1 million to the Commerce Department will be eligible for an \"expedited process\" to gain an immigrant visa, the executive order states. Corporations can sponsor people for Gold Cards if they give the government at least $2 million.",
      "Some 80,000 Gold Cards will be made available, according to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who said the program is still in the \"implementation phase.\"",
      "People who are approved for a Gold Card after vetting by the State Department and Department of Homeland Security \u2014 and who pay a $15,000 \"vetting fee\" \u2014 will be considered lawful permanent residents, more commonly known as green-card holders, Lutnick told reporters Friday. He said Gold Cards will take the place of the existing EB-1 and EB-2 visa programs, which offer green cards to people with \"exceptional ability\" in business or other fields.",
      "\"You can prove exceptional value for the United States of America by contributing $1 million to the United States of America. That's a pretty good expectation that they're highly valuable,\" he said.",
      "Lutnick said: \"In less than a month, the other visa Green Card categories are likely to be suspended, and this will be the model that people can come into the country.\"",
      "The administration is also considering offering a $5 million \"Platinum Card\" that will allow people to spend up to 270 days in the country without paying taxes on their non-U.S. income. That program, which Lutnick said would not offer a pathway to citizenship, will need approval from Congress before it launches. The federal government has set up an online waiting list.",
      "Separately, Mr. Trump signed an executive order Friday that imposes an extra $100,000 fee for people who wish to enter the U.S. on an H-1B visa, a non-immigrant visa that allows tens of thousands of people to live and work in the U.S. for up to six years.",
      "The change could mark a substantial crackdown on the H-1B program. Critics argue that the visas allow employers to undercut U.S. workers by sponsoring foreign job applicants willing to work for lower salaries. But supporters of the program argue it is essential to industries like tech that often struggle to find qualified U.S.-based workers \u2014 with firms like Amazon applying for thousands of H-1Bs per year \u2014 and employers are already required to pay H-1B recipients no less than the wages earned by similarly qualified workers.",
      "Asked Friday how he believes tech companies will react to the new H-1B fee, Mr. Trump told reporters: \"I think they're going to be very happy.\"",
      "\"And we're going to be able to keep people in our country that are going to be very productive people, and in many cases, these companies are going to pay a lot of money for that, and they're very happy about it,\" the president said.",

      "Washington \u2014 A Republican measure to keep the government funded until Nov. 21 stumbled in the Senate after clearing the House on Friday, leaving lawmakers without a clear path forward to avoid a funding lapse at the end of the month as they leave Washington for at least a week.",
      "The short-term funding bill passed the House in a 217 to 212 vote, with one Democrat voting in favor and two Republicans in opposition. Republican Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Victoria Spartz of Indiana voted against the bill, while Democratic Rep. Jared Golden of Maine supported it.",
      "But the bill failed to reach the 60 votes needed to advance in the Senate, by a vote of 44 in favor to 48 opposed. Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania was the lone Democrat who joined Republicans in supporting the bill. GOP Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rand Paul of Kentucky joined Democrats in voting no. Senators also voted on a competing proposal from Democrats, which likewise failed.",
      "With a 53-seat majority, Republicans need to earn the support of at least seven Democrats to resolve the funding dispute by the Oct. 1 deadline, when funding expires. Senate Democrats have said they oppose the bill because of Republicans' unwillingness to negotiate over Democratic priorities, notably health care.",
      "The House and Senate were both originally scheduled to be in recess until Sept. 29, but House leaders extended their break past the Oct. 1 deadline to pressure the Senate to adopt their bill. They said members should be prepared to return to Washington if the government shuts down.",
      "President Trump told reporters in the Oval Office Friday afternoon the U.S. could \"very well end up with a closed country\" for a while.",
      "\"We'll continue to talk to the Democrats, but I think you could very well end up with a closed country for a period of time,\" he said. \"And we'll take care of the military, we'll take care of Social Security, we'll take care of the things we have to take care of.\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said Friday that it's unlikely he will call senators back to Washington next week. He said Democrats' proposal is \"laden down with partisan policies\" and that there would be another vote on the Republican measure once the Senate returns to Washington at the end of the month.",
      "\"We're prepared, when we get back, to have a vote on a bill already passed by the House, ready to be signed by the president,\" Thune said. \"All it takes is a handful of Democrats to join Republicans in keeping the government open and funded.\"",
      "The House GOP bill would extend current spending levels for seven weeks. The legislation also funds additional security for lawmakers in the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination, to the tune of $30 million for Congress and $58 million for the executive and judicial branches. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said Friday that the House could pass additional security funding in a standalone bill next month.",
      "Democrats proposed a counteroffer that would keep the government open for a month and provide more than $320 million in security funds. But it would also permanently extend enhanced tax credits under the Affordable Care Act that expire at the end of the year, roll back Medicaid cuts in Mr. Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" and restore funding for public broadcasters that was rescinded earlier this year.",
      "All were nonstarters with Republicans, who said those provisions do not belong in a short-term funding bill.",
      "\"This is what my friends on the other side asked for \u2014 a clean bill. No partisan riders, no tricks, no things. And give it to us for a short period,\" said Rep. Tom Cole, an Oklahoma Republican. \"You got exactly what you asked for.\"",
      "Though Democrats typically support measures to keep the government funded, the party is under intense pressure to stand up to Republicans and the White House. During the last funding fight in March, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer allowed Republicans to move ahead with their spending bill, a move that earned him severe criticism by members of his own party. Many Democrats argued it would have been better to allow the government to shut down than to go along with Republicans.",
      "Schumer, a New York Democrat, told Punchbowl News on Thursday that he believes that Republicans would bear the brunt of the blame for a shutdown this time around, and that Democrats' position is \"quite strong.\" He struck a defiant tone on the Senate floor after the House bill passed.",
      "\"When we were in the majority for four years, there was not a shutdown. Not one. Why? Because we did what you're supposed to do: talk in a bipartisan negotiation and each side has input. The reason we're having a shutdown now is you and your leadership refuse to talk to Democrats and have any input, and want only your imprimatur on the bill, which we believe hurts Americans badly with health care,\" Schumer said, addressing Republicans.",
      "Democratic leaders have urged their Republican counterparts to negotiate with them on a funding plan. But Thune and Johnson suggested there's no need, since Democrats regularly support \"clean\" continuing resolutions to keep the government funded.",
      "Asked after the House vote if he was open to negotiating with Democratic leaders in the event of a shutdown, Johnson said \"heck no,\" as long as Democrats are dug in on their funding demands.",
      "\"We could have turned this into a partisan measure, and we chose not to do that,\" Johnson said. \"The ball is in Chuck Schumer's court.\"",
      "Schumer said later Friday, \"Now that it's clear that neither bill will get the 60 votes that the Senate needs, it's time to negotiate.\"",
      "\"But Republicans have now left town with no sign they want to avoid a shutdown in a week,\" he said. \"They left town.\"",

    "story": [
      "Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas sharply criticized the head of the Federal Communications Commission for urging ABC to crack down on the now-benched late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, calling the Trump appointee's comments \"dangerous as hell\" and comparing his move to a mafia shakedown.",
      "ABC, owned by Disney, took \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" off the air indefinitely on Wednesday, two days after Kimmel faced criticism for his comments on conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination. Just hours before the company's decision, FCC Chair Brendan Carr had publicly urged ABC to \"take action\" in response to Kimmel's remarks, saying in an interview: \"We can do this the easy way or the hard way.\"",
      "On his podcast Friday, Cruz called Carr a \"good guy\" but skewered him for his outspoken intervention.",
      "\"I gotta say, that's right out of 'Goodfellas.' That's right out of a mafioso coming into a bar, going, 'nice bar you have here, it'd be a shame if something happened to it,'\" the Texas senator said, mimicking a mob boss's accent.",
      "Kimmel had drawn conservatives' ire for saying during his monologue on Monday's show: \"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it.\" Kimmel also mocked President Trump's reaction to the shooting.",
      "Cruz had little sympathy for Kimmel, whom he called \"profoundly unfunny\" and \"bitter and nasty.\" The senator also called the comedian's disappearance from the airwaves a \"fantastic thing\" and argued his show was preempted because he \"flat-out lied\" about Kirk's killing.",
      "But the senator warned that the FCC chair's approach could set a risky precedent.",
      "\"If the government gets in the business of saying, \u2026 'we're going to ban you from the airwaves if you don't say what we like,' that will end up bad for conservatives,\" Cruz said.",
      "\"Let me tell you what will happen: Going down this road, there will come a time when a Democrat wins again, wins the White House,\" he added. \"They will silence us, they will use this power, and they will use it ruthlessly. And that is dangerous.\"",
      "Asked about Cruz's comments Friday, Mr. Trump called Carr a \"courageous person\" and said he disagrees with the senator.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the FCC for comment.",
      "Carr called for action on Kimmel in an interview Wednesday with right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson. The FCC commissioner \u2014 a staunch Trump ally \u2014 called Kimmel's remarks \"some of the sickest conduct possible,\" and suggested it would be appropriate for ABC to suspend Kimmel. He also said the independent companies that own ABC's local affiliates ought to \"push back\" against the network and possibly take Kimmel's show off the air, pointing to FCC rules requiring broadcast TV stations to act in the public interest.",
      "Shortly after Carr's comments on Wednesday, media giants Nexstar and Sinclair Broadcast Group \u2014 which each own dozens of ABC affiliate stations \u2014 announced they would preempt Kimmel's show, condemning Kimmel's remarks about Kirk's assassination.",
      "Nexstar has a deal pending to purchase rival station owner Tegna, which will require FCC approval. A Nexstar spokesperson told CBS News: \"The decision to preempt 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' was made unilaterally by the senior executive team at Nexstar, and they had no communication with the FCC or any government agency prior to making that decision.\"",
      "Later Wednesday, an ABC spokesperson said the show will be \"pre-empted indefinitely,\" taking Kimmel off the airwaves nationwide.",
      "The move drew outrage, with the FCC's lone Democratic appointee, Commissioner Anna Gomez, accusing ABC of engaging in a \"shameful show of cowardly corporate capitulation\" that \"has put the foundation of the First Amendment in danger.\"",
      "\"This FCC does not have the authority, the ability, or the constitutional right to police",
      "content or punish broadcasters for speech the government dislikes,\" she said in a statement.",
      "ABC's decision added to a weeklong debate over free speech in the wake of Kirk's death, as conservatives and Trump administration figures have called for consequences against anybody who mocks, celebrates or makes light of the assassination.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has celebrated Kimmel's indefinite departure from the airwaves \u2014 and suggested Thursday that TV networks should \"maybe\" lose their licenses over negative coverage.",
      "\"They'll take a great story and they'll make it bad,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on Friday, arguing coverage of him is overwhelmingly negative. \"See, I think that's really illegal, personally.\"",

Wade. His messages were posted in the weeks after a leaked draft opinion from the high court indicated it was poised to overturn the decision, which established the constitutional right to abortion. The Supreme Court would strike down Roe in June 2022.",
      "\"What do you think would happen if [Kavanaugh] died?\" Roske wrote on May 18, 2022, according to the sentencing memo. He also sent a message that day stating, \"Also the right have a 5-4 majority so if one conservative justice dies then it becomes a 5-4 for the left,\" prosecutors said.",
      "Days later, on May 27, Roske wrote \"im gonna stop roe v wade from being overturned\" and, in response to the question \"what u tryna do,\" he said, \"remove some people from the supreme court,\" according to the messages cited by prosecutors.",
      "\"Yeah but i could get at least one, which would change the votes for decades to come. and I am shooting for 3,\" Roske wrote, according to the court filing.",
      "Roske also conducted Google searches for \"how much force do you need to stab someone's neck,\" \"most effective way to silently kill someone\" and \"how to break a lock,\" according to the memorandum.",
      "Prosecutors said that a map saved in Roske's Google account contained pins that marked what he believed were the homes of four sitting Supreme Court justices. The Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority.",
      "Roske conducted internet searches related to combat and body armor, guns, shooting from long ranges and breaking into homes throughout May 2022, according to Justice Department lawyers. He also researched the Supreme Court and \"targeted certain justices,\" they wrote in the sentencing memo.",
      "Roske looked into Kavanaugh \"extensively,\" including his name and home address, and researched three other members of the Supreme Court and their home addresses, the memo said. The other justices are identified only as \"Justice 2,\" \"Justice 3\" and \"Justice 4\" in court papers.",
      "Before leaving for Maryland, Roske searched for \"windows how to wipe down a drive,\" and sought to delete his Discord account, prosecutors said.",
      "His research also included what may happen after he carried out a crime, including ways to evade prosecution by fleeing to countries without extradition agreements with the U.S. and possible defenses, according to prosecutors' sentencing memorandum.",
      "Roske flew from California, where he lived, to the Washington, D.C., area on June 8, 2022, and took a taxi to Kavanaugh's house in Maryland. He arrived around 1 a.m. with a suitcase packed with a Glock 17 pistol; two loaded magazines and additional ammunition; a chest rig, which is a harness used to carry gear; a knife; lock picks; a hammer; screwdriver; nail punch; crowbar; duct tape; hiking boots with padding attached to the bottom of the soles; and pepper spray, according to prosecutors.",
      "Prosecutors said the material affixed to the bottom of Roske's shoes was designed to quiet his footsteps.",
      "A deputy U.S. Marshal guarding Kavanaugh's residence saw Roske pull up in the car and went to get out of her vehicle when he arrived, according to the memorandum. After he realized law enforcement was outside the house, Roske said he decided to walk past Kavanaugh's house, prosecutors said. Roske then received a phone call from his sister and called 911 after speaking to her for roughly 20 minutes, according to the memo.",
      "Roske was arrested by local police after he called the authorities, and officers found the weapons and tools in his luggage during a search. He later told detectives that he had conducted research on Kavanaugh and bought the gun \"with the intention of using it. To kill [the justice] and then myself,\" court filings show. He also told police that the Supreme Court's draft opinion reversing Roe made him \"upset\" and motivated his plan to kill Kavanaugh, according to prosecutors.",
      "\"Another motivating factor was I heard that the current court was thinking about loosening gun restrictions,\" Roske said, according to the filing.",
      "Prosecutors asked the judge to apply a terrorism enhancement when determining Roske's sentence because his conduct was designed \"to influence or affect the conduct of government by intimidation or coercion, or to retaliate against government conduct.\"",
      "\"The defendant sought to influence or affect the workings of the Supreme Court, both in the outcome of a then-pending decision and, in the defendant's own words, in the judiciary's decisions for 'decades to come,'\" they wrote.",
      "Prosecutors also said that because Roske targeted and planned to kill up to three Supreme Court justices, he \"sought single-handedly and irrevocably to alter an entire branch of the United States government through violence.\"",
      "They also wrote that Roske's actions have sparked other threats, saying that Kavanaugh received a letter earlier this year invoking Roske's name and referencing a gunshot to the justice's head.",
      "Details about the breadth of Roske's plans come as federal judges nationwide have experienced a rise in threats of violence. Chief Justice John Roberts warned in his year-end report last December about threats to judicial independence, including violence and intimidation. Justice Amy Coney Barrett\u00a0told CBS News senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell in an interview that she has received death threats.",
      "A trio of federal judges publicly detailed threats to their safety and harassment they have received in recent months, including being targeted through \"pizza doxxing.\" CBS News reported in May that roughly two dozen judges across the country have received unsolicited pizza deliveries in the name of Daniel Anderl, the late son of U.S. District Judge Esther Salas.",
      "Anderl was killed when he answered the door at his family's New Jersey home in 2020 and was shot by a disgruntled gunman who was targeting Salas.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court to freeze a lower court's order and allow the government to end deportation protections for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans in the U.S.",
      "U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer asked the Supreme Court to allow the government to revoke the protections, known as temporary protected status, while a legal battle plays out in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and in any further proceedings before the Supreme Court.",
      "Earlier this month, Judge Edward Chen of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ruled that the administration's move to end TPS for Venezuelans and Haitians in the U.S. was unlawful. The 9th Circuit has declined to stay the lower court's decision.",
      "In May, the Supreme Court\u00a0allowed the Trump administration to end\u00a0the TPS program for Venezuelans, but that ruling only concerned a preliminary order from Chen, who decided the full merits of the case this month.",
      "Roughly 300,000 Venezuelans are in the U.S. through the program, which is intended for nationals of countries where it's too dangerous to return because of war, natural disasters or other emergencies. The Trump administration encouraged Venezuelans to self-deport when the administration announced it was ending the TPS designation for them. The administration has argued that temporary protected status was never meant to allow migrants to remain in the U.S. indefinitely.",
      "Although the district judge also ruled against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's attempt to end TPS for Haitian citizens, the administration is only asking the Supreme Court to intervene when it comes to Venezuelans who are affected. The case's main plaintiff is the National TPS Alliance, led by TPS beneficiaries.",
      "The Trump administration has been looking to end temporary protected status for people from multiple countries. On Friday, the Department of Homeland Security said it was ending deportation protections for thousands of Syrians living in the U.S.",

Waltz takes the position as Mr. Trump's frustrations increase with Russia over its refusal to end its war in Ukraine and as the U.S. seeks to manage tensions with China and Iran, while negotiating an end to the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas.",
      "This summer, Democrats teased a bruising confirmation hearing for Waltz after he was embroiled in the controversy over a Signal chat in which top administration officials inadvertently disclosed sensitive details about a military strike in Yemen. But Waltz escaped the hearing mostly unscathed, with the scandal not coming up until more than an hour into questioning.",
      "The Senate Foreign Relations Committee originally advanced his nomination on July 24, with the help of the panel's top Democrat, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire. But Waltz was among numerous nominees who were sent back to the panel earlier this month over procedural objections from Democrats about how they were initially voted out of the committee.",

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The Trump administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court to allow it to enforce for now its policy ending the use of the \"X\" marker on passports and requiring the documents to reflect the passport-holder's \"biological sex at birth,\" changes that affect transgender and nonbinary Americans.",
      "The high court's emergency appeal seeks to lift a lower court order that prevented the State Department from enforcing the policy, which was put into place after President Trump returned to the White House in January. The court order allowed transgender or nonbinary people seeking passports to self-select the sex designation \u2014 \"M,\" \"F\" or \"X\" \u2014 that aligns with their gender identity.",
      "The policy from Mr. Trump was a reversal from the Biden administration, which allowed the selection of M, F or X. The X marker was intended for passport applicants who are nonbinary, or those who don't identify as strictly male or female.",
      "Under an executive order signed by Mr. Trump earlier this year, \"sex\" was defined as an \"individual's immutable biological classification as either male or female.\" It directed the State Department to make changes to require that government-issued documents like passports \"accurately reflect the holder's sex,\" effectively prohibiting the government from allowing applicants to choose a sex marker based on their gender identity.",
      "In the wake of that directive, the State Department stopped issuing passports with the X marker and changed applications to offer only the M or F markers. It also adopted procedures for using an applicant's sex that matches their birth certificate or other documents.",
      "Seven transgender and nonbinary people sued the administration in February over the new passport policy, alleging that the change was unconstitutional and violated federal law. They sought an injunction requiring the State Department to reinstate the Biden administration's policy as to themselves and allow them to self-attest to their sex, including by selecting the X designation.",
      "U.S. District Judge Julia Kobick granted the request in April and found in part that Mr. Trump's executive order and passport policy were motivated by animus toward transgender people and violated their right to equal protection under the law.",
      "Kobick, appointed by President Joe Biden, required the Trump administration to process and issue passports for six of the seven plaintiffs consistent with the Biden administration's policy.",

      "The judge later extended her preliminary injunction to cover members of a certified class who are in need of a new passport or need to change their existing document to have its sex designation align with their gender identity.",
      "The Trump administration appealed the decision and sought emergency relief allowing it to enforce its new policy. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit denied that request earlier this month.",
      "In the emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued the passport policy is \"eminently lawful.\" He argued that the injunction issued by the Boston judge blocking its enforcement compels the Trump administration to \"speak to foreign governments in contravention of both the President's foreign policy and scientific reality.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 19 Sep 2025 10:18:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Legal experts say Trump lacks authority to designate domestic terrorist organizations, but the planned move could still affect some law enforcement approaches.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced on social media Wednesday that he's designating antifa as a \"major terrorist organization.\" But what that action would mean for the movement remains unclear, given that antifa has no official leadership or organization structure, and the president lacks authority to designate domestic terrorist organizations, experts say.",
      "The president's announcement comes as he and his supporters continue to denounce \"radical left wing political violence\" following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk last week. After Kirk's killing, Mr. Trump blamed rhetoric from the \"radical left,\" saying that it is \"directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now.\"",
      "Officials described the attack on Kirk as \"targeted,\" and family members of the suspected shooter, Tyler Robinson, said he had \"become more political\" in recent years. Robinson wrote in text messages to his roommate that he had carried out the attack because he \"had enough of [Kirk's] hatred,\" according to court filings. There has not been evidence presented to the public linking Robinson to antifa.",
      "This is not the first time Mr. Trump has argued antifa poses a threat \u2014 in his first term, he claimed the movement was behind looting and rioting during protests against police brutality in 2020. A November 2021 report on anarchist and left-wing violence in the U.S. from George Washington University's Program on Extremism and the National Counterrorism, Innovation, Technology and Education Center noted that the first Trump administration largely labeled the threat from anarchist violent extremists as originating from antifa.",
      "What is antifa?",
      "Short for \"anti-fasict,\" antifa activism can be traced back to antiracists who opposed the activities of members of the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis, according to a June 2020 report from the Congressional Research Service. But the movement gained attention after the violent clashes between white nationalists and anti-racism protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017.",
      "The Congressional Research Service describes antifa as \"decentralized\" and lacking a \"unifying organizational structure or detailed ideology.\" Instead, it consists of \"independent, radical, like-minded groups and individuals\" that largely believe in the principles of anarchism, socialism and communism.",
      "\"There is no single organization called antifa. That's just not the way these activists have ever organized themselves,\" said Michael Kenney, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh who has studied antifa. \"There's tremendous variation inside that movement, even on issues like political violence.\"",
      "The FBI has warned about violence perpetrated by antifa adherents, and in 2017, then-FBI Director Chris Wray told Congress that the bureau was looking into \"a number of what we would call anarchist extremist investigations, where we have properly predicated subjects who are motivated to commit violent criminal activity on kind of an antifa ideology,\" according to CRS.",
      "Wray, who was appointed FBI director by Mr. Trump during his first term, also acknowledged in congressional testimony in 2019 that the FBI doesn't investigate ideology, but does investigate violence. Then, in 2020, he said antifa is a \"movement or an ideology,\" not an organization.",
      "A 2020 assessment from the Center for Strategic and International Studies found that far-right attacks and plots have outpaced those from other perpetrators, including far-left networks. A 2022 study from the University of Maryland's National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism also found that \"right-wing extremists\" are more violent than left-wing actors.",
      "But CSIS said its data has indicated a rise in violent activity by \"antifa extremists, anarchists and related far-left extremists,\" which it said is likely connected to the \"concurrent increase in violent far-right activity.\"",
      "What could Trump's suggested designation do?",
      "Mr. Trump announced in May 2020 that the U.S. would be designating antifa as a \"major terrorist organization following nationwide unrest in response to the death of George Floyd,\" but nothing followed from that.",
      "Luke Baumgartner, a research fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, said the president does not have the authority to designate domestic terrorist organizations, even if this were an \"organization.\"",
      "\"There is no legal mechanism that I'm aware of within U.S. code that would give the president or the federal government the power to declare a domestic 'group' as a major terrorist organization or a major terrorist group,\" he said.",
      "The administration could, however, shift antifa to a higher priority for federal law enforcement, Baumgartner said, which could lead to more frequent investigations or arrests.",
      "The FBI and Department of Homeland Security don't officially designate U.S. extremist groups as \"domestic terrorist organizations,\" in part because of First Amendment concerns, according to CRS.",
      "A 2023 report from the research entity also noted that the government does not provide a \"precise, comprehensive, and public explanation of any particular groups it might consider to be domestic terrorist organizations,\" and it warned that listing groups in that way may infringe on free speech rights or \"the act of belonging to an ideological group, which in and of itself is not a crime in the United States.\"",
      "\"At this point, it's not a crime in America to have 'leftist' political beliefs along the lines that some anti-fascists do,\" Kenney said.",
      "He added that designating groups as domestic terrorist organizations could also raise Fourth Amendment concerns regarding surveillance.",
      "\"Do we as Americans still enjoy the right to free speech, to nonviolent political expression of our views, however unpalatable the Trump administration might find those views? Yes,\" Kenney said.",
      "While the U.S. does not have a list of domestic terrorist organizations, it does have a Foreign Terrorist Organizations list. Among the groups on the list are Hamas, al Qaeda and ISIS, which are known to operate transnationally. These groups are not related to the antifa movement.",
      "Kenney said that if the president were to try to designate antifa as a foreign terrorist organization, it would unlock tools like economic sanctions to bring greater pressure on the movement. Mr. Trump hasn't said he has this in mind, though he said he'd recommend \"those funding ANTIFA be thoroughly investigated.\" A foreign terrorist designation, if it were possible, would make it a crime to provide material support to antifa. Making this designation would present other challenges, however.",
      "\"When the president refers to antifa, whether in remarks to reporters or speeches, he's usually referring to domestic non-state actors and domestic incidents, so how are they going to portray that as foreign? That's not clear to me,\" Kenney said.",
      "Can the Justice Department charge someone associated with antifa with domestic terrorism?",
      "No. The FBI defines domestic terrorism as \"violent, criminal acts committed by individuals and/or groups to further ideological goals stemming from domestic influences, such as those of a political, religious, social, racial, or environmental nature.\" But it is not a chargeable offense under federal law.",
      "\"You can't prosecute an ideology,\" Baumgartner said.",
      "But there are numerous federal criminal statutes that could apply to domestic terrorism.",
      "In the case of Dylann Roof, a white supremacist who killed nine Black parishioners at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015, he was convicted of 33 counts of federal hate crimes, obstruction of religious exercise and firearms charges.",
      "Payton Gendron, who killed 10 Black people at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, in 2022, is facing federal hate crime and weapons charges. Gendron also pleaded guilty to a state terrorism charge.",
      "Thirty-two states and the District of Columbia criminalize the act of domestic terrorism, according to the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law. In 21 states and D.C., it is a crime to provide support to further an act of terrorism or a terror.",
      "Harsher punishments a possibility",

    "story": [
      "The European Union proposed Friday bringing forward a ban on Russian gas imports as part of a new package of sanctions aimed at sapping Moscow's war chest after pressure from President Trump.",
      "Under the measures presented for approval by the bloc's member states, the European Commission said it aims to phase out liquefied natural gas (LNG) purchases from Russia by January 2027 \u2014 one year earlier than planned.",
      "\"Russia's war economy is sustained by revenues from fossil fuels. We want to cut these revenues. So we are banning imports of Russian LNG into European markets,\" commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said. \"It is time to turn off the tap.\"",
      "The proposal comes as the United States pressures the EU to end fossil fuel imports from Russia and the bloc seeks, in turn, to persuade Mr. Trump to take a tougher stance on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. Mr. Trump has so far held back from upping pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin but said last week he was ready to do so if allies stopped buying Russian oil and hit China with tariffs.",
      "Von der Leyen did not give full details of the sanctions package, but officials told the Reuters news agency it would also target Chinese refineries, special economic zones, and Russian and central Asian banks.",
      "\"We are now going after these who fuel Russia's war, who purchase oil in breach of sanctions,\" von der Leyen said, according to Reuters. \"We target refineries, oil traders, petrochemical companies in third countries including China.\"",
      "The 27-nation EU has already banned most Russian oil under previous rounds of sanctions, slashing the share it imports from 29% in early 2021 to 2% by mid-2025. Only Hungary and Slovakia, friendly to Moscow and Mr. Trump, still buy it.",
      "The multiple rounds of European sanctions imposed since Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022 have sought to sap its war chest with everything from asset freezes to a near-complete ban on importing Russian oil.",
      "Despite a push to end decades of European dependency, Russia still supplied 19% of the EU's gas in 2024 \u2014 down from 45% before the war. This is in part down to an increase in purchases of liquefied natural gas (LNG) transported by sea, which has\u00a0partially offset a sharp fall in pipeline imports.",

      "Fellow late-night show hosts used a mix of humor, expressions of solidarity and even a song to respond to the suspension of\u00a0ABC host Jimmy Kimmel\u00a0in their shows on Thursday.",
      "Jon Stewart, who made a special appearance to skewer Kimmel's suspension, opted for satire to critique ABC for suspending \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" indefinitely following comments Kimmel made about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.",
      "Stephen Colbert, whose show was canceled by CBS two months ago,\u00a0called Kimmel's suspension \"blatant censorship.\"",
      "Meanwhile, NBC's Jimmy Fallon praised Kimmel and vowed to keep doing his own show as usual. Then an announcer spoke over him and replaced most of his critiques about President Trump with flattery.",
      "Their guests the day after Kimmel's suspension varied widely. Fallon's guests were actor Jude Law, journalist Tom Llamas and actor and singer Jonathan Groff \u2014 none of whom addressed Kimmel's situation.",
      "Stewart and Colbert interviewed guests who could address censorship concerns raised by Kimmel's suspension. American and Filipino journalist and Nobel Peace Prize recipient Maria Ressa spoke to Stewart.",
      "When Stewart asked Ressa, the author of \"How to Stand Up to a Dictator,\" for tips on coping with the current moment, Ressa recounted how she and her colleagues at the news site Rappler \"just kept going\" when she was faced with 11 arrest warrants in one year under the Philippines' then-President Rodrigo Duterte.",
      "\"We just kept doing our jobs. We just kept putting one foot in front of the other,\" Ressa said.",
      "Kimmel's show was \"preempted indefinitely\" by ABC on Wednesday following comments he made about the reaction to Kirk's killing on Monday and Tuesday nights. The suspension came after media giant Nexstar announced in a news release that it would indefinitely preempt Kimmel's show on all its stations due to the host's remarks. Sinclair Broadcast Group, another major station owner, also said it was pulling the show.",
      "Nexstar has\u00a0a deal pending to purchase Tegna, a smaller rival, for $6.2 billion, and needs the Federal Communications Commission to approve it.",
      "\"The decision to preempt 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' was made unilaterally by the senior executive team at Nexstar, and they had no communication with the FCC or any government agency prior to making that decision,\" a Nexstar spokesperson told CBS News in an email Thursday.",
      "FCC Chairman Brendan Carr also said his agency had a strong case for holding Kimmel, ABC and network parent Walt Disney Co. accountable for spreading misinformation.",
      "Kimmel has not commented.",
      "Stewart's show opened with a voice-over promising adherence to the party line.",
      "\"We have another fun, hilarious administration-compliant show,\" it said.",
      "He lavished praise on the president and satirized his criticism of large cities and his deployment of the National Guard to fight their crime.",
      "\"Coming to you tonight from the real (expletive), the crime-ridden cesspool that is New York City. It is a tremendous disaster like no one's ever seen before. Someone's National Guard should invade this place, am I right?\" Stewart said.",
      "\"The Daily Show\" set was refashioned with decorative gold engravings, in a parody of the new gold accents that Mr. Trump has added to many parts of the Oval Office.",
      "Stewart fidgeted nervously with his notes as though he was worried about mis-speaking or deviating from his talking points. When members of the audience reacted with an \"aww,\" he whispered, \"What are you doing? Shut up. You're going to (expletive) blow this for us.\"",
      "He took on a more stilted tone when he started describing Mr. Trump's visit to the United Kingdom, calling the president \"our great father.\"",
      "\"Gaze upon him. With a gait even more majestic than that of the royal horses that prance before him,\" he said.",
      "Stewart normally hosts only on Mondays. The Emmy winner helmed \"The Daily Show\" from 1999 through 2015, delivering sharp, satirical takes on politics and current events and interviews with newsmakers. He returned to host once a week during the run-up to the 2024 U.S. presidential election.",
      "Fallon opened his \"Tonight Show\" monologue addressing Kimmel's suspension.",
      "\"To be honest with you all, I don't know what's going on. And no one does. But I do know Jimmy Kimmel, and he's a decent, funny and loving guy, and I hope he comes back,\" he said.",
      "Colbert started his monologue on Thursday with the animated song \"Be Our Guest\" from Disney's \"Beauty and the Beast,\" but replaced the lyrics with \"Shut your trap. Shut your trap.\"",
      "He later addressed Kimmel directly, saying he stands with him and his staff.",
      "\"If ABC thinks that this is going to satisfy the regime, they are woefully naive,\" he said.",
      "He also responded to remarks Carr made that it is important for broadcasters to push back on Disney programming, \"they determine falls short of community values.\"",
      "\"Well, you know what my community values are, buster? Freedom of speech,\" Colbert said to loud applause from his audience.",
      "When Colbert talked with New Yorker editor David Remnick about Kimmel's suspension, he said: \"What we are seeing now is the government acting at the direction of the president of the United States to put pressure on, to manipulate, to silence and even to shut down institutions of the free world.\"",
      "David Letterman, Colbert's predecessor on \"The Late Show,\" lamented the networks' moves.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced on Thursday new action to reform the nation's organ transplant system, as well as a move to decertify an organ procurement organization.",
      "\"Every American should feel safe becoming an organ donor and giving the gift of life, yet decades of ignored patient safety concerns have driven more and more Americans off the donor list,\" Kennedy said. \"Today, under President Trump's leadership, we are taking bold action and historic action to restore trust in the organ procurement process.\"",
      "Transplant experts said last year there had been a\u00a0spike\u00a0in people revoking\u00a0organ donor\u00a0registrations, after a report that a Kentucky man who'd been declared dead woke up just as a team was preparing to remove his organs. Since then, there have been more\u00a0reports\u00a0of attempts to remove organs from patients who had mistakenly been declared dead.",
      "Kennedy said at a news conference that \"we are acting because of years of documented patient safety data failures and repeated violations of federal requirements, and we intend this decision to serve as a clear warning.\"",
      "The secretary said the Life Alliance Organ Recovery Agency, a division of the University of Miami Health System, \"has a long record of deficiencies directly tied to patient harm.\"",
      "\"Unlike the Biden administration, which ignored these problems and failed to act, the Trump administration is setting a new standard that patient safety comes first,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Kennedy said along with the decertification, HHS is reforming the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network and \"investing in new ways to encourage organ donation.\"",
      "In July, HHS announced a plan to begin reforming the organ transplant system, citing a federal investigation that \"revealed disturbing practices by a major organ procurement organization.\"",
      "Kennedy said in a statement at the time that the investigation, conducted by the Health Resources and Services Administration under HHS, showed \"that hospitals allowed the organ procurement process to begin when patients showed signs of life,\" calling it \"horrifying\" and pledging to hold accountable organ procurement organizations that coordinate access to transplants.",
      "HHS said the investigation examined 351 cases where organ donation was \"authorized, but ultimately not completed,\" finding that nearly 30% showed \"concerning features,\" like neurological signs in patients that the agency said are incompatible with organ donation. And at least 28 patients \"may not have been deceased at the time organ procurement was initiated.\"",
      "More than 100,000 people are on the national transplant waiting list, and 13 people die every day waiting for a transplant, according to the Health Resources and Services Administration. There are 55 organ procurement organizations nationwide that serve specific geographic regions.",
      "House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith and House Oversight Subcommittee Chairman David Schweikert wrote a\u00a0letter to Life Alliance Organ Recovery Center in July demanding documents about reports that claim the organization \"knowingly and deliberately engaged in a Medicare fraud scheme.\" The letter also cites reporting from The New York Times on a case involving the organization in which, the lawmakers said, \"clinicians sedated a patient, withdrew life support, and waited for death before removing the organs of a patient who was crying and biting on his breathing tube which one Life Alliance employee interpreted as the patient not wanting to die.\"",
      "\"Patient safety lapses have long been a recurring issue for your organization and others like it, reflecting a history of ongoing concerns rather than isolated incidents,\" the chairmen wrote.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Life Alliance Organ Recovery Agency for comment.",
      "The Association of Organ Procurement Organizations, of which Life Alliance is a member, pledged in a statement \"that we and our members will keep saving lives nationwide\" and \"will continue to support the team at Life Alliance to ensure South Florida organ donors, transplant patients and their families have access to organ donation and transplantation services.\"",
      "\"As advocates for the patients and donor families we serve, OPOs are committed to and invested in the ongoing improvement of our nation's organ donation and transplantation system,\" the group said. \"Patient safety is the top priority for everyone involved in this lifesaving work and it guides our actions every day.\"",
      "Kennedy has been pushing major changes to the nation's health care systems since he was sworn in earlier this year. And he has faced criticism in recent weeks over his leadership of the department amid a number of departures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On Wednesday, Susan Monarez, who was ousted as CDC director by Kennedy less than a month after she was confirmed, testified before a Senate committee that she faced pressure from the secretary to change the childhood vaccine schedule, regardless of whether there was scientific evidence to support doing so.",

      "Scientists have discovered prehistoric insects preserved in amber for the first time in South America, providing a fresh glimpse into life on Earth at a time when flowering plants were just beginning to diversify and spread around the world.",
      "Many of the specimens found at a sandstone quarry in Ecuador date to 112 million years ago, said Fabiany Herrera, curator of fossil plants at the Field Museum in Chicago and co-author of the study published Thursday in the journal Communications Earth and Environment. At least six types of arthropods were found preserved, according to the study.",
      "Almost all known amber deposits from the past 130 million years have been in the Northern Hemisphere, and it's long been \"an enigma\" that scientists have found few in southern regions that once comprised the supercontinent Gondwana, said David Grimaldi, an entomologist at the American Museum of Natural History who was not involved in the discovery.",
      "This marks the first time researchers have identified ancient beetles, flies, ants and wasps in fossilized tree resin in South America, said Ricardo P\u00e9rez-de la Fuente, a paleoentomologist at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, who also was not involved in the new study.",
      "\"Amber pieces are little windows into the past,\" P\u00e9rez-de la Fuente said, adding that the discovery will help researchers understand the evolving interactions between flowering plants and insects that lived during the era of the dinosaurs.",
      "The researchers uncovered hundreds of fragments of amber, some containing ancient insects, pollen and tree leaves, at a sandstone quarry in Ecuador that's on the edge of what is today the Amazon basin.",
      "Two types of amber were discovered, according to the study: There was a more common form of amber found around the roots of resin-producing plants, and a rarer form of the material formed from resin exposed to air. The amber formed around the roots did not hold any specimens, the study said.",
      "\"A different kind of forest\"",
      "The discoveries provide evidence that the area was once a \"humid, resinous forest ecosystem,\" according to the study.",
      "But today's rainforest is much different from what dinosaurs roamed through, Herrera said. Based on an analysis of fossils in the amber, the ancient rainforest contained species of ferns and conifers, including the unusual Monkey Puzzle Tree, that no longer grow in Amazonia.",
      "\"It was a different kind of forest,\" said Herrera.",
      "The amber deposits were previously known to geologists and miners who worked at the Genoveva quarry. Study co-author Carlos Jaramillo at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute first heard of them about a decade ago and set out to find the exact location, aided by geology field notes.",
      "\"I went there and realized this place is amazing,\" Jaramillo said. \"There's so much amber in the mines,\" and it's more visible in the open quarry than it would be if hidden under dense layers of vegetation.",
      "Researchers will continue to analyze the amber trove to learn more about Cretaceous-era biodiversity \u2014 including the insects that contributed to evolution by feeding on flowering plants. \"Amber tends to preserve things that are tiny,\" said Grimaldi.",

    "story": [
      "In the forests of Uganda and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, chimps crowd into fig and plum trees, feasting on fruit that's sweet, soft and just a little boozy. A new study shows those daily snacks quietly add up to the equivalent of nearly two alcoholic beverages for humans.",
      "A team of scientists at University of California Berkeley and other institutions tested the fruit chimps actually snack on: figs in Uganda's canopy and the plum-like fruits on the forest floor in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Collecting the data wasn't easy \u2014 with little electricity beyond solar panels and constant humidity threatening the instruments, researchers spent three seasons hauling equipment and calibrating test kits to measure alcohol in many different tropical fruits.",
      "In the end, they found that on average, the fruit's alcohol content came in at about .3% by weight. This is kombucha-level, but when chimpanzees eat 10 pounds of fruit a day and weigh around 90 pounds, it adds up to about 14 grams of ethanol, equating to about two cocktails for a human.",
      "But don't picture chimps swinging drunkenly from the trees. To actually get drunk, they'd have to binge on fruit until their bellies ballooned, the researchers said. Instead, they're exposed to a steady low dose, a quiet buzz from nature's own fermentation process.",
      "Senior author of the paper and UC Berkeley professor of integrative biology Robert Dudley first floated the \"drunken monkey\" hypothesis in 2000, arguing that our attraction to alcohol could come from ancestral fruit-eating habits. Dudley argued that it makes sense primates would be tuned to alcohol, since their diets have long revolved around ripe fruit.",
      "\"Once you start eating, it acts as an aperitif,\" he said. \"The pleasure of association with drinking alcohol increases feeding rates.\"",
      "Other animals chase the same buzz too.",
      "\"Open a bottle of beer outside and a fruit fly appears almost instantly,\" Dudley said.",
      "Spider monkeys in Panama, slow lorises in Malaysia and even elephants have been documented consuming naturally fermented fruit or nectar.",
      "What makes this study different is that it provides the first direct chemical measurements of ethanol in the fruits that wild chimps routinely eat, and then connects those numbers to daily intake.",
      "The open question is whether chimps are actually selecting fruit for its alcohol content or just chasing sugar and calories. Either way, Dudley says the story connects to us.",
      "\"We inherited the taste for alcohol,\" Dudley said. \"Even though our diets have diversified \u2026 that bias to consume quickly when this molecule is present could still be a powerful force.\"",

    "story": [
      "The sun has become more and more active over the last 16 years, in a turn that surprised scientists and could affect space weather and technology on Earth, NASA announced\u00a0this week.",
      "A new research, conducted by two NASA scientists and published earlier in September in the peer-reviewed\u00a0Astrophysical Journal Letters, shows that solar activity has ramped up after 2008 \u2014 an unexpected reversal following a decades-long decline that was initially thought to foreshadow a period of historic inaction on the surface of the sun.",
      "\"All signs were pointing to the Sun going into a prolonged phase of low activity,\" Jamie Jasinski, a space plasma physicist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the study's lead author, said in a statement. \"So it was a surprise to see that trend reversed. The Sun is slowly waking up.\"",
      "An uptick in solar activity could influence space weather, potentially leading to more solar storms,\u00a0solar flares\u00a0and coronal mass ejections, the researchers found. Space weather patterns have the potential to directly impact spacecraft operations and the safety of astronauts, but\u00a0they may be felt on Earth, too, as space weather can affect power grids, GPS systems and radio communication, according to NASA.",
      "The downward trend was documented from the 1980s until 2008, when the space agency determined that the sun had reached its weakest point on record. The sun's action, or inaction, tends to fluctuate in 11-year cycles, according to NASA, although some patterns draw on longer.",
      "Earth is currently in\u00a0Solar Cycle 25, which began in 2020. The last cycle maintained an average length of 11 years and was the weakest solar cycle to occur in a century, according to the National Weather Service. Scientists thought the sun would stay in what they dubbed \"deep solar minimum,\" believing that the stretch of quietness from the sun would continue, eventually leading to a new phase of record low activity.",
      "\"But then the trend of declining solar wind ended,\" Jasinski said in NASA's announcement.",
      "His study, co-authored by Marco Velli, a fellow researcher at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, instead tracked increasing bursts of solar plasma and stronger magnetic field measurements throughout the solar system, which are all affected by the sun.",
      "Solar Cycle 26 is expected to begin some time between January 2029 and December 2032, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said, but the agency has not yet produced a prediction for the next cycle.",
      "In order to better track space weather, NASA announced that it will launch the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP) and\u00a0Carruthers Geocorona Observatory\u00a0missions, as well as the NOAA's\u00a0SWFO-L1\u00a0mission, from Falcon 9 as early as next week. It comes just a few months after\u00a0SpaceX helped NASA launch TRACERS twin satellites which are studying how the electrically-charged solar wind interacts with Earth's magnetic field.",
      "\"Space weather predictions are critical for supporting the spacecraft and astronauts of NASA's Artemis campaign, as understanding the space environment is a vital part of mitigating astronaut exposure to space radiation,\" NASA said Monday.",
      "In May 2024, NASA officials recorded the\u00a0strongest geomagnetic storm in more than 20 years. Several X-class solar flares \u2014 the largest of B-class, followed by C and M \u2014 sent the\u00a0northern lights\u00a0to far lower latitudes than normal,\u00a0as far south as Mexico.",

      "Among the more mouth-watering items being delivered \"are what I'd call specialties,\" Contella said. \"The crew can eat these during any of the upcoming holidays or at any time really, but these are foods like clams, oysters, crab, roast turkey and smoked salmon, plus treats like candies, cookies and ice cream.\"",
      "\"We also have a high school breakfast competition food called ... shakshuka scramble. It's based on a popular dish throughout North Africa and the Middle East made of eggs cooked in spicy sauce.\"",
      "Mounted atop pad 40 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, the Falcon 9's first stage engines thundered to life at 6:11 p.m. EDT, generating 1.7 million pounds of thrust to push the rocket up into the early evening sky on a northeasterly trajectory matching the space station's orbit.",
      "After powering out of the thick lower atmosphere, the first stage separated, reversed course and flew itself back to a spectacular landing at the Space Force station to chalk up SpaceX's 67th Florida touchdown and its 505th successful booster recovery overall.",
      "The Falcon 9's second stage, meanwhile, put the Cygnus into the planned preliminary orbit and released it to fly on its own 14-and-a-half minutes after liftoff. If all goes well, the spacecraft will catch up with the space station early Wednesday for capture by the lab's robot arm.",
      "Berthing will come four days after a Russian Progress cargo ship, launched Thursday from Kazakhstan, docked at the lab's aft port, bringing propellant, a new Russian spacesuit and other needed supplies to the outpost.",
      "Sunday's launch was the third of at least four SpaceX flights purchased by Northrop Grumman while the company develops a new booster of its own. And it was the first flight of a Cygnus XL, so named because the spacecraft has been lengthened to allow it to carry more cargo to the space station.",
      "\"We've been partnering with Northrop Grumman on this update, and we're excited that Northrop is ready to deliver this incredibly beneficial increase in capacity,\" Contella said. \"It's about 1.6 meters (5 feet) longer, and it carries about 2,600 additional pounds more cargo.\"",
      "NASA pays for cargo delivery flights using Cygnus spacecraft and SpaceX's Dragon. To date, SpaceX has successfully carried out 32 Dragon resupply missions, while Northrop Grumman has launched 21 successful flights. Both companies suffered one in-flight failure each early in the commercial resupply program.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tiktok-algorithm-us-china-deal-trump/",
    "published": "Fri, 19 Sep 2025 18:20:31 -0400",
    "summary": "TikTok's algorithm is the \"secret sauce\" behind the app's success, experts say. U.S.-China talks over the app's ownership must resolve who controls the technology.",
    "story": [
      "A deal in the works between the U.S. and China over the ownership of TikTok could include a licensing agreement for the closely guarded secret of the social media company's algorithm, to which access has proved a major sticking point in negotiations between the countries.",
      "The Chinese government once vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm, the technology that seems to intuit user preferences almost instantaneously and that has been a driving force for the video-sharing app's explosive growth in recent years.",
      "Previously, TikTok had also seemed unwilling to budge. In May, when the platform was challenging a 2024 law banning TikTok in the U.S., the company said in a legal filing that \"divesting TikTok Inc.'s U.S. business and completely severing it from the globally integrated platform of which it is a part is not commercially, technologically, or legally feasible.\"",
      "President Trump this week\u00a0again pushed back enforcement of the TikTok law, which would require its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, to sell its stake in the app or be cut off from the U.S. market. In the meantime, an agreement between the U.S. and China appears to be moving forward. Mr. Trump on Friday said he and Chinese President Xi Jinping have\u00a0\"made progress\" in talks over a potential deal to resolve the dispute over TikTok's ownership.",
      "Although key elements of the framework deal remain unclear, when some details were released earlier this week, Wang Jingtao, deputy director of China's Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, told reporters in Madrid that the arrangement included agreement over \"the use of intellectual property rights,\" according the Associated Press.",
      "William Akoto, an assistant professor at American University, thinks ByteDance executives may be urging the Chinese government to strike a deal so the company can continue earning revenue from the algorithm, while maintaining a foothold in the U.S.",
      "ByteDance and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "How would a TikTok licensing deal work?",
      "Mr. Trump, asked Thursday about what will happen with TikTok's algorithm, said, \"TikTok has tremendous value. The United States has that value in its hand since we're the ones that have to approve it.\"",
      "Chinese law\u00a0prohibits the export of TikTok's proprietary algorithm, including to the U.S., without government approval, according to experts. So exactly how a licensing deal would work remains unclear, including whether ByteDance could maintain any sort of outside control over TikTok's algorithm once ownership transfers to U.S. owners.",
      "\"What I understand is they would give a U.S. entity legal permission to use it under certain terms,\" said Sarah Kreps, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, a nonpartisan policy research organization. \"So it would be like they're renting the algorithm rather than selling it.\"",
      "Kreps added that in retaining a measure of ownership over the algorithm, ByteDance could have the right to access internal TikTok metrics and influence how content is ranked in the U.S., akin to how a software vendor can patch or upgrade licensed software.",
      "The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter,\u00a0said\u00a0this week that TikTok would create a new U.S. app and that the company's engineers would re-create content-recommendation algorithms using technology licensed from ByteDance.",
      "A White House spokesperson declined to comment on the contours of the U.S.-China framework deal over TikTok. \"Any details of the TikTok framework are pure speculation unless they are announced by this administration,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "What makes TikTok's algorithm special?",
      "Algorithms are complex data systems that act as recommendation engines, ranking the content users ultimately see in their feeds. They also help companies gather information about their customers in order to serve them targeted advertisements, a key source of revenue.",
      "Like other social media players, TikTok's algorithm delivers content to users based on their interests and interactions on the platform. Lauryn Williams, a deputy director and senior fellow focused on technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, described the algorithm as TikTok's \"secret sauce.\"",
      "Kreps highlights the algorithm's ability to quickly pick up on user behavior, interests and preferences. \"There's something about it that is so well-tailored to what they understand people to want that it gets them on the platform and keeps them there in ways that don't seem to be the case with other platforms,\" she said.",
      "In its own explanation of how it recommends videos, TikTok says it considers a range of factors, such as how long someone stays on a video and personal user information, such as someone's language preference or country of origin. The algorithm then \"selects from a large collection of eligible content and ranks them based on the system's prediction of how likely you'll be interested in each one.\"",
      "A Supreme Court ruling\u00a0from January\u00a0upholding the TikTok ban\u00a0notes\u00a0that each interaction a user has on TikTok \u2014 whether watching a video, following an account or leaving a comment \u2014 enables the recommendation system to \"further tailor a personalized content feed.\"",
      "National security concerns",
      "In Madrid, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said on Monday that \"we want to ensure that the Chinese have a fair, invested environment in the United States, but always that U.S. national security comes first,\"\u00a0according\u00a0to CNN.",
      "But while a deal between the U.S. and China could address the ownership dispute, it might not resolve all of the national security concerns that led Congress to pass the TikTok ban with bipartisan support in April of 2024, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Justice Department last year accused TikTok of collecting sensitive data about U.S. users, warning that the Chinese government could use the information to manipulate the content that people see. It also said TikTok employees were able to communicate directly with ByteDance engineers in China via an internal messaging system called Lark.",
      "In 2022, TikTok acknowledged in a letter to U.S. senators that China-based employees could have access to American users' data in certain circumstances and said it was taking steps to strengthen data security.",
      "In its\u00a0decision to uphold the TikTok ban in January, the Supreme Court also noted that China can require TikTok's parent company \"to cooperate with [its] efforts to obtain personal data,\" and that \"there is little to stop all that information from ending up in the hands of a designated foreign adversary.\"",
      "To minimize any national security concerns, Akoto, the American University assistant professor, said the new arrangement would have to ensure that the app's China-based engineers are unable to access the U.S. version of Tiktok. If the algorithm sends user data back to China or if the algorithm can be updated outside of the U.S, that could leave American users' data vulnerable, he said.",
      "When Jingtao, the deputy director of China's Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, spoke to the press earlier this week, he indicated the U.S. and China have agreed on entrusting a partner with handling U.S. user data and content security, although its unclear how exactly that would work.",

      "Nvidia said it will spend $5 billion to buy Intel common stock at $23.28 a share. The investment, which is subject to regulatory approvals, comes a month after the U.S. government took a 10% stake in Intel.",
      "\"This historic collaboration tightly couples NVIDIA's AI and accelerated computing stack with Intel's CPUs and the vast x86 ecosystem \u2014 a fusion of two world-class platforms,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said. \"Together, we will expand our ecosystems and lay the foundation for the next era of computing.\"",
      "The two companies said they will work on \"seamlessly connecting\" their architectures.",
      "In morning trading, Intel shares jumped 25%, its biggest one-day percentage gain in decades. Nvidia shares added 2%.",
      "For data centers, Intel will make custom chips that Nvidia will use in its AI infrastructure platforms. While for PC products, Intel will build chips that integrate Nvidia technology.",
      "The agreement provides a lifeline for Intel, which was a Silicon Valley pioneer that enjoyed decades of growth as its processors powered the personal computer boom, but fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone's 2007 debut.",
      "Intel fell even farther behind in recent years amid the artificial intelligence boom that's propelled Nvidia into the world's most valuable company. Intel lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, and expects to slash its workforce by a quarter by the end of 2025.",

      "Nvidia, meanwhile, has soared because its specialized chips are underpinning the artificial intelligence boom. The chips, known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, are highly effective at developing powerful AI systems.",
      "The deal between the two chipmakers comes as China moves to be less dependent on U.S. semiconductor technology. This week, Chinese officials reportedly forbade several large domestic technology companies from purchasing Nvidia chips, and Huawei announced that it was expanding its development of AI chips and manufacturing.",
      "While Nvidia and Intel will work together to develop new chips, a manufacturing deal has yet to be struck between the two.

      "Also testifying Tuesday was Megan Garcia, the mother of 14-year-old Sewell Setzer III of Florida.",
      "Garcia sued another\u00a0AI company, Character Technologies, for wrongful death last year, arguing that before his suicide, Sewell had become increasingly isolated from his real life as he engaged in highly sexualized conversations with the chatbot.",
      "His mother told CBS News last year that her son withdrew socially and stopped wanting to play sports after he started speaking to an AI chatbot. The company said after the teen's death, it made changes that require users to be\u00a013 or older to create an account and that it would launch parental controls in the first quarter of 2025. Those controls were rolled out in March.",
      "Hours before the Senate hearing, OpenAI pledged to roll out new safeguards for teens, including efforts to detect whether ChatGPT users are under 18 and controls that enable parents to set \"blackout hours\" when a teen can't use ChatGPT. The company said it will attempt to contact the users' parents if an under-18 user is having suicidal ideation and, if unable to reach them, will contact the authorities in case of imminent harm.",
      "\"We believe minors need significant protection,\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement outlining the proposed changes.",
      "Child advocacy groups criticized the announcement as not enough.",
      "\"This is a fairly common tactic \u2014 it's one that Meta uses all the time \u2014 which is to make a big, splashy announcement right on the eve of a hearing which promises to be damaging to the company,\" said Josh Golin, executive director of Fairplay, a group advocating for children's online safety.",
      "\"What they should be doing is not targeting ChatGPT to minors until they can prove that it's safe for them,\" Golin said. \"We shouldn't allow companies, just because they have tremendous resources, to perform uncontrolled experiments on kids when the implications for their development can be so vast and far-reaching.\"",
      "California State Senator Steve Padilla, who introduced legislation to create safeguards in the state around AI Chatbots, said in a statement to CBS News, \"We need to create common-sense safeguards that rein in the worst impulses of this emerging technology that even the tech industry doesn't fully understand.\"",
      "He added that technology companies can lead the world in innovation, but it shouldn't come at the expense of \"our children's health.\"",
      "The Federal Trade Commission said last week it had launched an inquiry into several companies about the potential harms to children and teenagers who use their AI chatbots as companions.",

      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is looking into reports that faulty electronic door handles on 2021 Tesla Model Y SUVs prevented owners from entering and exiting the vehicles, according to filing on the regulator's website. In several cases, parents describe situations in which they were unable to access children inside the car.",
      "The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) received nine reports on \"inoperable door handles,\" with the most commonly reported issues involving parents' inability to reenter the car after placing their child in the back seat before going on a drive, or to remove their child from the back seat at the end of a drive.",

      "While Tesla vehicles have internal manual door releases, they cannot be operated by small children, according to the safety watchdog.",
      "According to the regulator's preliminary review, the handles on some Model Y vehicles appear to become inoperable \"when the electronic door locks receive insufficient voltage from the vehicle.\" However, no warnings prior to the exterior door handle failures \u2014 such as a low voltage battery warning \u2014 have been reported by owners, according to NHTSA.",
      "The investigation involves 174,290 Tesla Model Y SUVs from model year 2021 and is focused on the functionality of the electronic door locks from outside of the vehicle. The agency said it \"will continue to monitor any reports of entrapment involving opening doors from inside of the vehicle, and ODI will take further action as needed.\"",

      "Technology company Oracle is among a consortium of firms that would enable TikTok to continue operations in the U.S. if a framework deal between the United States and China to take over the social media company is finalized, sources with knowledge of the negotiations tell CBS News.",
      "The precise structure of the final deal was unclear Monday night, but will include multiple companies, the sources said. It's not clear what level of involvement Chinese firms \u2014 including TikTok's current parent company ByteDance \u2014 will have in the deal, and who will control TikTok's powerful recommendation algorithm. Presidents Trump and Xi are expected to talk on Friday.",
      "The deal includes a blend of new investors, including Silver Lake, a private equity firm based in California, and existing investors, the sources said.",
      "Mr. Trump on Tuesday morning declined to say which companies are purchasing TikTok, but said they will be announcing that soon.",
      "\"We have a group of very big companies that want to buy it,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And, you know, the kids wanted it so badly. I had parents calling me up. They don't want it for themselves. They want it for their kids. They say, if I don't get it done, they're in big trouble with their kids.\"",
      "Oracle declined to comment. A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment. A spokesperson for Silver Lake didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Chinese Embassy in Washington responded on Tuesday morning that China will \"firmly defend its national interests, the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies, and will carry out technology export approvals according to relevant laws and regulations.\"",
      "The statement continued that the Chinese government \"also fully respects the will of enterprises and supports them in conducting business negotiations on an equal footing in accordance with market principles.\"",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday in Madrid after meetings with Chinese officials on a range of issues, including TikTok, that the commercial terms had been agreed upon.",
      "Oracle \u2014 the tech company co-founded by billionaire Larry Ellison \u2014 has long been seen as a possible buyer if the U.S. government forced a TikTok sale. Mr. Trump has described Ellison as a friend. (Larry Ellison's son, David Ellison, is the chairman & CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison Family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "In 2020, Mr. Trump endorsed a deal that would see Oracle and Walmart taking a 20% stake in a U.S.-based entity called TikTok Global. And in recent years, as TikTok has sought to regain trust with American users and regulators, it has partnered with Oracle to route U.S. TikTok users' activity through the Texas-based company's servers.",
      "Mr. Trump was circumspect about a deal with reporters in the Oval Office on Monday. \"We may let it die, or we may, I don't know, it depends. Up to China. It doesn't matter too much. I'd like to do it for the kids. They like it.\"",
      "Last year, Congress passed and then-President Joe Biden signed a bill that essentially gave TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, an ultimatum: either divest from TikTok or face a ban in the U.S. The Supreme Court upheld the law in a unanimous 9-0 decision. But Mr. Trump has issued a series of orders unilaterally delaying its enforcement. The latest came in June, when he pushed back the deadline for enforcing the measure until this Wednesday.",
      "The president's orders have directed the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against tech companies such asApple and Google for failing to comply with the law by offering the TikTok app on their platforms.",
      "The TikTok divestiture law was passed in 2024 after years of bipartisan concern over possible national security risks posed by the ultra-popular video app. Those include worries that the Chinese government could force ByteDance to divulge information on U.S.-based users or manipulate the platform's algorithm to control what Americans see. TikTok has long denied that the Chinese authorities exert any influence on the platform.",
      "The concerns stretch back to Mr. Trump's first term. The president signed an executive order to ban TikTok in the U.S. in 2020 on national security and data privacy grounds, but the move was blocked by a judge. Four years later, Mr. Trump\u00a0 changed his view and expressed support for the app, which he has credited for his improved performance among younger voters in last year's election.",

      "Shares of the electric vehicle maker rose more than 5% in morning trading.",

      "Earlier this month Tesla released a proposed pay package for Musk that would possibly make him the world's first trillionaire if he hits a series of extremely aggressive targets for the company over the next decade.",
      "Tesla said in a regulatory filing that it will hand Musk shares worth as much as 12% of the company in a dozen separate packages if the company meets certain performance targets, including massive increases in car production, share price and operating profit. If approved by shareholders, the new pay package could make Musk the world's first trillion dollar executive, and would mark a new level of outsized pay in a country already known for extreme compensation. But the payoff is in shares, not cash, and the goals are extreme as well.",
      "To get his first package of shares equivalent to 1% of the company, Musk would have to convince investors in the stock market that Tesla is worth $2 trillion in total, double what they value it today, and also hit several other milestones. To receive all the shares offered and make him the world's first trillion-dollar man would require that market value to then rise to $8.5 trillion, double that of the world's most valuable company now, chipmaker Nvidia.",

Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Victoria Spartz of Indiana voted against the bill, while Democratic Rep. Jared Golden of Maine supported it.",
      "But the bill failed to reach the 60 votes needed to advance in the Senate, by a vote of 44 in favor to 48 opposed. Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania was the lone Democrat who joined Republicans in supporting the bill. GOP Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rand Paul of Kentucky joined Democrats in voting no.

      "Democrats proposed a counteroffer that would keep the government open for a month and provide more than $320 million in security funds. But it would also permanently extend enhanced tax credits under the Affordable Care Act that expire at the end of the year, roll back Medicaid cuts in Mr. Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" and restore funding for public broadcasters that was rescinded earlier this year.",
      "All were nonstarters with Republicans, who said those provisions do not belong in a short-term funding bill.",
      "\"This is what my friends on the other side asked for \u2014 a clean bill. No partisan riders, no tricks, no things. And give it to us for a short period,\" said Rep. Tom Cole, an Oklahoma Republican. \"You got exactly what you asked for.\"",
      "Though Democrats typically support measures to keep the government funded, the party is under intense pressure to stand up to Republicans and the White House. During the last funding fight in March, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer allowed Republicans to move ahead with their spending bill, a move that earned him severe criticism by members of his own party. Many Democrats argued it would have been better to allow the government to shut down than to go along with Republicans.",
      "Schumer, a New York Democrat, told Punchbowl News on Thursday that he believes that Republicans would bear the brunt of the blame for a shutdown this time around, and that Democrats' position is \"quite strong.\" He struck a defiant tone on the Senate floor after the House bill passed.",
      "\"When we were in the majority for four years, there was not a shutdown. Not one. Why? Because we did what you're supposed to do: talk in a bipartisan negotiation and each side has input. The reason we're having a shutdown now is you and your leadership refuse to talk to Democrats and have any input, and want only your imprimatur on the bill, which we believe hurts Americans badly with health care,\" Schumer said, addressing Republicans.",
      "Democratic leaders have urged their Republican counterparts to negotiate with them on a funding plan. But Thune and Johnson suggested there's no need, since Democrats regularly support \"clean\" continuing resolutions to keep the government funded.",
      "Asked after the House vote if he was open to negotiating with Democratic leaders in the event of a shutdown, Johnson said \"heck no,\" as long as Democrats are dug in on their funding demands.",
      "\"We could have turned this into a partisan measure, and we chose not to do that,\" Johnson said. \"The ball is in Chuck Schumer's court.\"",
      "Schumer said later Friday, \"Now that it's clear that neither bill will get the 60 votes that the Senate needs, it's time to negotiate.\"",
      "\"But Republicans have now left town with no sign they want to avoid a shutdown in a week,\" he said. \"They left town.\"",

      "The plan was\u00a0reported\u00a0earlier by Bloomberg News.",

Some employers also award H-1Bs for entry-level roles rather than for senior positions with greater skill requirements, detractors of the program say.",
      "Tech companies have been among the primary beneficiaries of the visa program. Amazon received the\u00a0most H1-B visas\u00a0of any business in 2024, Department of Labor data shows. This year, the online retailer remains the leading recipient of the visas, with more than 10,000 awarded, followed by Tata Consultancy, Microsoft, Apple and Google.",

      "Last year, the most popular type of job for H-1B visas was software developer. To receive an H-1B visa, which is awarded by lottery, an applicant needs to have at least a bachelor's degree in their field and have been offered a temporary job by a U.S. company.",
      "President Trump plans to order the Labor Secretary to start a new rule-making process that would update wage levels for the program, Bloomberg reported. Currently, U.S. companies must offer the prevailing wage or the actual wage of similarly qualified workers, whichever is higher, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.",

    "published": "Fri, 19 Sep 2025 18:20:31 -0400",
    "summary": "TikTok's algorithm is the \"secret sauce\" behind the app's success, experts say. U.S.-China talks over the app's ownership must resolve who controls the technology.",
    "story": [
      "A deal in the works between the U.S. and China over the ownership of TikTok could include a licensing agreement for the closely guarded secret of the social media company's algorithm, to which access has proved a major sticking point in negotiations between the countries.",
      "The Chinese government once vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm, the technology that seems to intuit user preferences almost instantaneously and that has been a driving force for the video-sharing app's explosive growth in recent years.",
      "Previously, TikTok had also seemed unwilling to budge. In May, when the platform was challenging a 2024 law banning TikTok in the U.S., the company said in a legal filing that \"divesting TikTok Inc.'s U.S. business and completely severing it from the globally integrated platform of which it is a part is not commercially, technologically, or legally feasible.\"",
      "President Trump this week\u00a0again pushed back enforcement of the TikTok law, which would require its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, to sell its stake in the app or be cut off from the U.S. market. In the meantime, an agreement between the U.S. and China appears to be moving forward. Mr. Trump on Friday said he and Chinese President Xi Jinping have\u00a0\"made progress\" in talks over a potential deal to resolve the dispute over TikTok's ownership.",
      "Although key elements of the framework deal remain unclear, when some details were released earlier this week, Wang Jingtao, deputy director of China's Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, told reporters in Madrid that the arrangement included agreement over \"the use of intellectual property rights,\" according the Associated Press.",
      "William Akoto, an assistant professor at American University, thinks ByteDance executives may be urging the Chinese government to strike a deal so the company can continue earning revenue from the algorithm, while maintaining a foothold in the U.S.",
      "ByteDance and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "How would a TikTok licensing deal work?",
      "Mr. Trump, asked Thursday about what will happen with TikTok's algorithm, said, \"TikTok has tremendous value. The United States has that value in its hand since we're the ones that have to approve it.\"",
      "Chinese law\u00a0prohibits the export of TikTok's proprietary algorithm, including to the U.S., without government approval, according to experts. So exactly how a licensing deal would work remains unclear, including whether ByteDance could maintain any sort of outside control over TikTok's algorithm once ownership transfers to U.S. owners.",
      "\"What I understand is they would give a U.S. entity legal permission to use it under certain terms,\" said Sarah Kreps, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, a nonpartisan policy research organization. \"So it would be like they're renting the algorithm rather than selling it.\"",
      "Kreps added that in retaining a measure of ownership over the algorithm, ByteDance could have the right to access internal TikTok metrics and influence how content is ranked in the U.S., akin to how a software vendor can patch or upgrade licensed software.",
      "The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter,\u00a0said\u00a0this week that TikTok would create a new U.S. app and that the company's engineers would re-create content-recommendation algorithms using technology licensed from ByteDance.",
      "A White House spokesperson declined to comment on the contours of the U.S.-China framework deal over TikTok. \"Any details of the TikTok framework are pure speculation unless they are announced by this administration,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "What makes TikTok's algorithm special?",
      "Algorithms are complex data systems that act as recommendation engines, ranking the content users ultimately see in their feeds. They also help companies gather information about their customers in order to serve them targeted advertisements, a key source of revenue.",
      "Like other social media players, TikTok's algorithm delivers content to users based on their interests and interactions on the platform. Lauryn Williams, a deputy director and senior fellow focused on technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, described the algorithm as TikTok's \"secret sauce.\"",
      "Kreps highlights the algorithm's ability to quickly pick up on user behavior, interests and preferences. \"There's something about it that is so well-tailored to what they understand people to want that it gets them on the platform and keeps them there in ways that don't seem to be the case with other platforms,\" she said.",
      "In its own explanation of how it recommends videos, TikTok says it considers a range of factors, such as how long someone stays on a video and personal user information, such as someone's language preference or country of origin. The algorithm then \"selects from a large collection of eligible content and ranks them based on the system's prediction of how likely you'll be interested in each one.\"",
      "A Supreme Court ruling\u00a0from January\u00a0upholding the TikTok ban\u00a0notes\u00a0that each interaction a user has on TikTok \u2014 whether watching a video, following an account or leaving a comment \u2014 enables the recommendation system to \"further tailor a personalized content feed.\"",
      "National security concerns",
      "In Madrid, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said on Monday that \"we want to ensure that the Chinese have a fair, invested environment in the United States, but always that U.S. national security comes first,\"\u00a0according\u00a0to CNN.",
      "But while a deal between the U.S. and China could address the ownership dispute, it might not resolve all of the national security concerns that led Congress to pass the TikTok ban with bipartisan support in April of 2024, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Justice Department last year accused TikTok of collecting sensitive data about U.S. users, warning that the Chinese government could use the information to manipulate the content that people see. It also said TikTok employees were able to communicate directly with ByteDance engineers in China via an internal messaging system called Lark.",
      "In 2022, TikTok acknowledged in a letter to U.S. senators that China-based employees could have access to American users' data in certain circumstances and said it was taking steps to strengthen data security.",
      "In its\u00a0decision to uphold the TikTok ban in January, the Supreme Court also noted that China can require TikTok's parent company \"to cooperate with [its] efforts to obtain personal data,\" and that \"there is little to stop all that information from ending up in the hands of a designated foreign adversary.\"",
      "To minimize any national security concerns, Akoto, the American University assistant professor, said the new arrangement would have to ensure that the app's China-based engineers are unable to access the U.S. version of Tiktok. If the algorithm sends user data back to China or if the algorithm can be updated outside of the U.S, that could leave American users' data vulnerable, he said.",
      "When Jingtao, the deputy director of China's Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, spoke to the press earlier this week, he indicated the U.S. and China have agreed on entrusting a partner with handling U.S. user data and content security, although its unclear how exactly that would work.",

      "Merryday, a George H.W.

The designation was extended multiple times, including by the first Trump administration. Government data indicates nearly 4,000 Syrians in the U.S. had TPS protections as of the end of March.",
      "Since its creation by Congress in 1990, TPS has been used by Democratic and Republican administrations to offer a temporary safe haven to foreigners from nations dealing with an armed conflict, environmental disaster or other crises.

      "The revelation by the Justice Department came in a sentencing memorandum filed Friday with the U.S. district court in Maryland in the case of Nicholas Roske. Roske was arrested near Kavanaugh's home in early June 2022 with a handgun, ammunition, knife and a myriad of tools.",
      "He pleaded guilty in April to attempting to kill or kidnap a Supreme Court justice. Prosecutors are asking a judge to sentence Roske to at least 30 years to life in prison, arguing that his conduct is an affront to the Constitution and required \"extensive premeditation.\"",
      "\"The defendant researched; planned; procured the tools for the planned killings; traveled across the entirety of the country with those tools, including a gun; and attempted to delete online evidence of motive and intent,\" they wrote. \"The defendant's objective \u2014 to target and kill judges to seek to alter a court's ruling \u2014 is an abhorrent form of terrorism and strikes at the core of the United States Constitution and our prescribed system of government.\"",

      "\"No judicial or court official, or their family, should have to live under the fear and mental toll that they could, on any day, at any time of day or night, be gunned down based on a judicial decision,\" they said in the filing.",
      "The document lists various messages that prosecutors say Roske posted to the social media platform Discord throughout May 2022, which include references to the Supreme Court's 1973 decision in the landmark case Roe v. Wade. His messages were posted in the weeks after a leaked draft opinion from the high court indicated it was poised to overturn the decision, which established the constitutional right to abortion. The Supreme Court would strike down Roe in June 2022.",
      "\"What do you think would happen if [Kavanaugh] died?\" Roske wrote on May 18, 2022, according to the sentencing memo. He also sent a message that day stating, \"Also the right have a 5-4 majority so if one conservative justice dies then it becomes a 5-4 for the left,\" prosecutors said.",
      "Days later, on May 27, Roske wrote \"im gonna stop roe v wade from being overturned\" and, in response to the question \"what u tryna do,\" he said, \"remove some people from the supreme court,\" according to the messages cited by prosecutors.",
      "\"Yeah but i could get at least one, which would change the votes for decades to come. and I am shooting for 3,\" Roske wrote, according to the court filing.",
      "Roske also conducted Google searches for \"how much force do you need to stab someone's neck,\" \"most effective way to silently kill someone\" and \"how to break a lock,\" according to the memorandum.",
      "Prosecutors said that a map saved in Roske's Google account contained pins that marked what he believed were the homes of four sitting Supreme Court justices. The Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority.",
      "Roske conducted internet searches related to combat and body armor, guns, shooting from long ranges and breaking into homes throughout May 2022, according to Justice Department lawyers. He also researched the Supreme Court and \"targeted certain justices,\" they wrote in the sentencing memo.",
      "Roske looked into Kavanaugh \"extensively,\" including his name and home address, and researched three other members of the Supreme Court and their home addresses, the memo said. The other justices are identified only as \"Justice 2,\" \"Justice 3\" and \"Justice 4\" in court papers.",
      "Before leaving for Maryland, Roske searched for \"windows how to wipe down a drive,\" and sought to delete his Discord account, prosecutors said.",
      "His research also included what may happen after he carried out a crime, including ways to evade prosecution by fleeing to countries without extradition agreements with the U.S. and possible defenses, according to prosecutors' sentencing memorandum.",
      "Roske flew from California, where he lived, to the Washington, D.C., area on June 8, 2022, and took a taxi to Kavanaugh's house in Maryland. He arrived around 1 a.m. with a suitcase packed with a Glock 17 pistol; two loaded magazines and additional ammunition; a chest rig, which is a harness used to carry gear; a knife; lock picks; a hammer; screwdriver; nail punch; crowbar; duct tape; hiking boots with padding attached to the bottom of the soles; and pepper spray, according to prosecutors.",
      "Prosecutors said the material affixed to the bottom of Roske's shoes was designed to quiet his footsteps.",
      "A deputy U.S. Marshal guarding Kavanaugh's residence saw Roske pull up in the car and went to get out of her vehicle when he arrived, according to the memorandum. After he realized law enforcement was outside the house, Roske said he decided to walk past Kavanaugh's house, prosecutors said. Roske then received a phone call from his sister and called 911 after speaking to her for roughly 20 minutes, according to the memo.",
      "Roske was arrested by local police after he called the authorities, and officers found the weapons and tools in his luggage during a search. He later told detectives that he had conducted research on Kavanaugh and bought the gun \"with the intention of using it. To kill [the justice] and then myself,\" court filings show. He also told police that the Supreme Court's draft opinion reversing Roe made him \"upset\" and motivated his plan to kill Kavanaugh, according to prosecutors.",
      "\"Another motivating factor was I heard that the current court was thinking about loosening gun restrictions,\" Roske said, according to the filing.",
      "Prosecutors asked the judge to apply a terrorism enhancement when determining Roske's sentence because his conduct was designed \"to influence or affect the conduct of government by intimidation or coercion, or to retaliate against government conduct.\"",
      "\"The defendant sought to influence or affect the workings of the Supreme Court, both in the outcome of a then-pending decision and, in the defendant's own words, in the judiciary's decisions for 'decades to come,'\" they wrote.",
      "Prosecutors also said that because Roske targeted and planned to kill up to three Supreme Court justices, he \"sought single-handedly and irrevocably to alter an entire branch of the United States government through violence.\"",
      "They also wrote that Roske's actions have sparked other threats, saying that Kavanaugh received a letter earlier this year invoking Roske's name and referencing a gunshot to the justice's head.",
      "Details about the breadth of Roske's plans come as federal judges nationwide have experienced a rise in threats of violence. Chief Justice John Roberts warned in his year-end report last December about threats to judicial independence, including violence and intimidation. Justice Amy Coney Barrett\u00a0told CBS News senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell in an interview that she has received death threats.",

      "In May, the Supreme Court\u00a0allowed the Trump administration to end\u00a0the TPS program for Venezuelans, but that ruling only concerned a preliminary order from Chen, who decided the full merits of the case this month.",
      "Roughly 300,000 Venezuelans are in the U.S. through the program, which is intended for nationals of countries where it's too dangerous to return because of war, natural disasters or other emergencies.

The administration has argued that temporary protected status was never meant to allow migrants to remain in the U.S. indefinitely.",

    "story": [
      "Americans' grocery bills are growing, causing some shoppers to cut back on discretionary spending as they find themselves struggling to afford the basics.",
      "Food prices grew by half a percent from July to August, marking the fastest monthly rate of change since the fall of 2022. Behind the rising cost of food items on store shelves are three main culprits, according to experts.",
      "The Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs, climate change and a shortage of agricultural workers in the U.S. are the leading causes of grocery inflation, Phil Lempert, a food industry analyst also known as the \"Supermarket Guru,\" told CBS News correspondent Jo Ling Kent.",
      "Price hikes, he added, have been steepest on goods that the U.S. imports from nations facing higher levies. For example, the U.S. imports about 35% of its coffee from Brazil, whose exports are taxed at a rate of 50%.",
      "The latest Consumer Price Index data shows that coffee prices rose 21% in August compared with a year ago.",
      "As companies see their costs rise, they pass along those burdens to consumers. In the case of tariffs, some businesses began raising prices on products even before the levies were in full force.",
      "\"There's no question that what we've seen is, we're seeing companies increased prices because of the impending tariffs,\" said Lempert.",
      "\"What they want to do is they want to protect themselves. A lot of these big food companies are public companies. So what they've gotta do is they've gotta report back to their shareholders on profit margins. So they've been hedging their bets,\" Lempert said.",
      "Sometimes, packaged-goods companies disguise price hikes by offering consumers less product for the same amount of money. The covert inflation strategy has been dubbed \"shrinkflation,\" Lempert explained.",
      "\"What they're doing is they're trying to put less in the package, hoping that you and I are not gonna observe that and keep that price either stable or just slightly increased,\" he said",
      "Climate change",
      "Increasing temperatures and\u00a0shifts in weather patterns have made conditions for growing some fruits and vegetables in the U.S. inhospitable. As a result, a lot of domestic production has been moved to Central and Latin America, according to Lempert.",
      "\"We can't grow our food where we used to grow it,\" he said.",
      "Labor shortage",
      "Additionally, Mr. Trump's immigration policies, including raids on workplaces that employ large numbers of immigrants, plus waning interest in agricultural work, have led to an industrywide labor shortage, Lempert explained.",
      "Consumers are reacting to higher prices by looking for deals, purchasing store brand goods instead of name-brands and buying shelf-stable groceries in bulk at shopping clubs like Costco.",
      "Lempert said a little planning can go a long way to ensure that consumers can buy what they need.",
      "\"The number one thing that people want to do if they want to save money \u2014 stop wasting food,\" Lempert said.",
      "\"Forty percent of all of our food in this country is wasted. A lot of that's in our homes. So, take doggy bags from restaurants, use leftovers, freeze leftovers, don't waste food and you'll save a substantial amount of money,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "A Kansas sheriff's deputy was charged Thursday with murder in the death of a jail inmate who sustained broken ribs after his back was kneeled on after he was wheeled from the infirmary to his cell, according to an autopsy report.",
      "Wyandotte County District Attorney Mark Dupree said deputy Richard Fatherley has been charged with second-degree murder and an alternative count of involuntary manslaughter in the July 5 death of 50-year-old Charles Adair at the county's detention center in Kansas City, Kansas. Adair had been arrested one day earlier on misdemeanor warrants for failure to appear on multiple traffic violations.",
      "Dupree provided no details on how the man died, but the autopsy said Adair was being removed from his wheelchair when he got into an altercation with jail staff. According to the autopsy, the altercation ended with one officer kneeling on Adair's back. In addition to the rib fractures, Adair also sustained a sternal fracture, the autopsy report said.",
      "While Dupree declined to say whether Fatherley was the one who knelt, he also said no one else would be charged.",
      "The autopsy listed Adair's manner of death as homicide and his cause of death as complications from \"mechanical asphyxia,\" a condition in which breathing is obstructed. Also contributing to Adair's death was cardiovascular disease and cirrhosis, the autopsy found.",
      "\"Our family is still heartbroken over the loss of my brother,\" the man's brother, Anthony Adair, said in a statement released through the group Justice for Wyandotte. \"While we are grateful to see that charges have been filed, it is important for us to be able to see the camera footage of Charles' final moment.\"",
      "The sheriff's office declined a records request from The Associated Press seeking video of what happened. Asked about video during a news conference, Dupree said that all information in the case would be reviewed by a judge at the preliminary hearing and then would be made available in court.",
      "Fatherley, who was assigned to the detention center but was not a certified law enforcement officer, is on paid administrative leave. He received a summons on Thursday afternoon calling for him to appear in court, but has not been booked into jail. Dupree said that's customary for officers in the county facing charges.",
      "\"He was not a flight risk,\" Dupree said. \"He was, in fact, cooperative with the investigation\" and is expected to continue cooperating.",
      "Dupree added that he would file a request for an out-of-county judge to oversee the case \"due to the potential conflict of interest.\"",
      "Fatherley's attorney, James Spies, said the second-degree murder charge requires the state to prove that the defendant showed an extreme indifference to life, and, \"This case simply does not meet the elements of this crime.\"",
      "He noted that the prosecutor's alternative charge is involuntary manslaughter, which requires proof that a defendant acted with \"typical\" recklessness.",
      "\"We're going to be pursuing an acquittal in this case,\" Spies said. \"My client acted reasonably within the scope of his employment.\"",
      "No charges were filed after a similar autopsy finding in the 2021 death of Cedric Lofton, a 17-year-old who became unresponsive while restrained at a Wichita juvenile intake center. In that case, Sedgwick County District Attorney Marc Bennett said the state's \"stand-your-ground\" law prevented him from bringing any charges because staff members were protecting themselves.",
      "Spies said Adair's death was \"a tragic accident\" but was not a result of Fatherley's actions.",
      "Nikki Richardson, executive director of Justice for Wyandotte, countered that the autopsy report suggested that pressure had been applied to Adair using something called the shoulder pin maneuver.",
      "\"It is only supposed to be used when an officer feels their life is in danger,\" Richardson said. \"It is hard at this point in time with the facts to see where a jail staff or sheriff or officer would feel endangered when a person is leaving the infirmary and they're in a wheelchair.\"",
      "Any conviction on a second-degree murder charge carries a sentence of up to 41 years in prison while a manslaughter conviction carries up to 11 years.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-designating-antifa-terrorist-organization/",
    "published": "Fri, 19 Sep 2025 10:18:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Legal experts say Trump lacks authority to designate domestic terrorist organizations, but the planned move could still affect some law enforcement approaches.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced on social media Wednesday that he's designating antifa as a \"major terrorist organization.\" But what that action would mean for the movement remains unclear, given that antifa has no official leadership or organization structure, and the president lacks authority to designate domestic terrorist organizations, experts say.",
      "The president's announcement comes as he and his supporters continue to denounce \"radical left wing political violence\" following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk last week. After Kirk's killing, Mr. Trump blamed rhetoric from the \"radical left,\" saying that it is \"directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now.\"",
      "Officials described the attack on Kirk as \"targeted,\" and family members of the suspected shooter, Tyler Robinson, said he had \"become more political\" in recent years. Robinson wrote in text messages to his roommate that he had carried out the attack because he \"had enough of [Kirk's] hatred,\" according to court filings. There has not been evidence presented to the public linking Robinson to antifa.",
      "This is not the first time Mr. Trump has argued antifa poses a threat \u2014 in his first term, he claimed the movement was behind looting and rioting during protests against police brutality in 2020. A November 2021 report on anarchist and left-wing violence in the U.S. from George Washington University's Program on Extremism and the National Counterrorism, Innovation, Technology and Education Center noted that the first Trump administration largely labeled the threat from anarchist violent extremists as originating from antifa.",
      "What is antifa?",
      "Short for \"anti-fasict,\" antifa activism can be traced back to antiracists who opposed the activities of members of the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis, according to a June 2020 report from the Congressional Research Service. But the movement gained attention after the violent clashes between white nationalists and anti-racism protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017.",
      "The Congressional Research Service describes antifa as \"decentralized\" and lacking a \"unifying organizational structure or detailed ideology.\" Instead, it consists of \"independent, radical, like-minded groups and individuals\" that largely believe in the principles of anarchism, socialism and communism.",
      "\"There is no single organization called antifa. That's just not the way these activists have ever organized themselves,\" said Michael Kenney, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh who has studied antifa. \"There's tremendous variation inside that movement, even on issues like political violence.\"",
      "The FBI has warned about violence perpetrated by antifa adherents, and in 2017, then-FBI Director Chris Wray told Congress that the bureau was looking into \"a number of what we would call anarchist extremist investigations, where we have properly predicated subjects who are motivated to commit violent criminal activity on kind of an antifa ideology,\" according to CRS.",
      "Wray, who was appointed FBI director by Mr. Trump during his first term, also acknowledged in congressional testimony in 2019 that the FBI doesn't investigate ideology, but does investigate violence. Then, in 2020, he said antifa is a \"movement or an ideology,\" not an organization.",
      "A 2020 assessment from the Center for Strategic and International Studies found that far-right attacks and plots have outpaced those from other perpetrators, including far-left networks. A 2022 study from the University of Maryland's National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism also found that \"right-wing extremists\" are more violent than left-wing actors.",
      "But CSIS said its data has indicated a rise in violent activity by \"antifa extremists, anarchists and related far-left extremists,\" which it said is likely connected to the \"concurrent increase in violent far-right activity.\"",
      "What could Trump's suggested designation do?",
      "Mr. Trump announced in May 2020 that the U.S. would be designating antifa as a \"major terrorist organization following nationwide unrest in response to the death of George Floyd,\" but nothing followed from that.",
      "Luke Baumgartner, a research fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, said the president does not have the authority to designate domestic terrorist organizations, even if this were an \"organization.\"",
      "\"There is no legal mechanism that I'm aware of within U.S. code that would give the president or the federal government the power to declare a domestic 'group' as a major terrorist organization or a major terrorist group,\" he said.",
      "The administration could, however, shift antifa to a higher priority for federal law enforcement, Baumgartner said, which could lead to more frequent investigations or arrests.",
      "The FBI and Department of Homeland Security don't officially designate U.S. extremist groups as \"domestic terrorist organizations,\" in part because of First Amendment concerns, according to CRS.",
      "A 2023 report from the research entity also noted that the government does not provide a \"precise, comprehensive, and public explanation of any particular groups it might consider to be domestic terrorist organizations,\" and it warned that listing groups in that way may infringe on free speech rights or \"the act of belonging to an ideological group, which in and of itself is not a crime in the United States.\"",
      "\"At this point, it's not a crime in America to have 'leftist' political beliefs along the lines that some anti-fascists do,\" Kenney said.",
      "He added that designating groups as domestic terrorist organizations could also raise Fourth Amendment concerns regarding surveillance.",
      "\"Do we as Americans still enjoy the right to free speech, to nonviolent political expression of our views, however unpalatable the Trump administration might find those views? Yes,\" Kenney said.",
      "While the U.S. does not have a list of domestic terrorist organizations, it does have a Foreign Terrorist Organizations list. Among the groups on the list are Hamas, al Qaeda and ISIS, which are known to operate transnationally. These groups are not related to the antifa movement.",
      "Kenney said that if the president were to try to designate antifa as a foreign terrorist organization, it would unlock tools like economic sanctions to bring greater pressure on the movement. Mr. Trump hasn't said he has this in mind, though he said he'd recommend \"those funding ANTIFA be thoroughly investigated.\" A foreign terrorist designation, if it were possible, would make it a crime to provide material support to antifa. Making this designation would present other challenges, however.",
      "\"When the president refers to antifa, whether in remarks to reporters or speeches, he's usually referring to domestic non-state actors and domestic incidents, so how are they going to portray that as foreign? That's not clear to me,\" Kenney said.",
      "Can the Justice Department charge someone associated with antifa with domestic terrorism?",
      "No. The FBI defines domestic terrorism as \"violent, criminal acts committed by individuals and/or groups to further ideological goals stemming from domestic influences, such as those of a political, religious, social, racial, or environmental nature.\" But it is not a chargeable offense under federal law.",
      "\"You can't prosecute an ideology,\" Baumgartner said.",
      "But there are numerous federal criminal statutes that could apply to domestic terrorism.",
      "In the case of Dylann Roof, a white supremacist who killed nine Black parishioners at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015, he was convicted of 33 counts of federal hate crimes, obstruction of religious exercise and firearms charges.",
      "Payton Gendron, who killed 10 Black people at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, in 2022, is facing federal hate crime and weapons charges. Gendron also pleaded guilty to a state terrorism charge.",
      "Thirty-two states and the District of Columbia criminalize the act of domestic terrorism, according to the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law. In 21 states and D.C., it is a crime to provide support to further an act of terrorism or a terror.",
      "Harsher punishments a possibility",
      "But Baumgartner said that where alleged domestic terrorism does come into play at the federal level is in increased penalties for perpetrators. Prosecutors have sought harsher punishments for felony offenses that \"involved, or was intended to promote, a federal crime of terrorism.\"",
      "The Justice Department asked federal judges in 2023 to apply a terrorism adjustment in cases involving members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, far-right organizations whose members were convicted on charges stemming from the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, including seditious conspiracy.",
      "When ex-Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio was sentenced for multiple crimes related to the riot, prosecutors succeeded in applying the terrorism enhancement to his sentencing, although the judge did not allow it to heavily affect the length of the 22-year sentence. Mr. Trump issued Tarrio a full pardon upon taking office in January. He also commuted the sentences of members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers.",

      "Meanwhile, NBC's Jimmy Fallon praised Kimmel and vowed to keep doing his own show as usual. Then an announcer spoke over him and replaced most of his critiques about President Trump with flattery.",
      "Their guests the day after Kimmel's suspension varied widely. Fallon's guests were actor Jude Law, journalist Tom Llamas and actor and singer Jonathan Groff \u2014 none of whom addressed Kimmel's situation.",
      "Stewart and Colbert interviewed guests who could address censorship concerns raised by Kimmel's suspension. American and Filipino journalist and Nobel Peace Prize recipient Maria Ressa spoke to Stewart.",
      "When Stewart asked Ressa, the author of \"How to Stand Up to a Dictator,\" for tips on coping with the current moment, Ressa recounted how she and her colleagues at the news site Rappler \"just kept going\" when she was faced with 11 arrest warrants in one year under the Philippines' then-President Rodrigo Duterte.",
      "\"We just kept doing our jobs. We just kept putting one foot in front of the other,\" Ressa said.",
      "Kimmel's show was \"preempted indefinitely\" by ABC on Wednesday following comments he made about the reaction to Kirk's killing on Monday and Tuesday nights. The suspension came after media giant Nexstar announced in a news release that it would indefinitely preempt Kimmel's show on all its stations due to the host's remarks. Sinclair Broadcast Group, another major station owner, also said it was pulling the show.",
      "Nexstar has\u00a0a deal pending to purchase Tegna, a smaller rival, for $6.2 billion, and needs the Federal Communications Commission to approve it.",
      "\"The decision to preempt 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' was made unilaterally by the senior executive team at Nexstar, and they had no communication with the FCC or any government agency prior to making that decision,\" a Nexstar spokesperson told CBS News in an email Thursday.",

      "Dr. Rami Mhanna, the managing director of Shifa Hospital, where some of the bodies were brought, said the dead included six people from the same family after a strike hit their home early Saturday morning. They were relatives of the hospital's director, Dr. Mohamed Abu Selmiya, he said.",
      "The Palestinian Red Crescent said five other people were killed in another strike close to Shawa Square.",
      "Israel's military didn't immediately respond to questions about the strikes.",
      "In recent days, Israel has been urging hundreds of thousands of Palestinians sheltering in Gaza City to move south to what it calls a humanitarian zone.",
      "Palestinians have streamed out of the city \u2014 some by car, others on foot. Israel opened another corridor south of Gaza City for two days this week to allow more people to evacuate. But many Palestinians in the famine-stricken city are unwilling to be uprooted again, too weak to leave or unable to afford the cost of moving.",
      "Aid groups have warned that forcing thousands of people to evacuate will exacerbate the dire humanitarian crisis. They are urging for a ceasefire so aid can reach those who need it.",
      "The latest Israeli operation, which started this week, likely pushes any ceasefire farther out of reach. The Israeli military, which says it wants to \"destroy Hamas' military infrastructure,\" hasn't given a timeline for the offensive, but there were indications it could take months.",
      "The death count in Gaza has climbed over 65,100, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which is part of the Hamas-run government, since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led terrorists stormed into southern Israel and killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Over 250 people were also abducted as hostages. Forty-eight hostages remain in Gaza, with fewer than half believed to be alive.",
      "The Gaza Health Ministry does not say how many of the dead were civilians or militants. Its figures are seen as a reliable estimate by the U.N. and many independent experts. Israeli bombardment in the territory has also destroyed vast areas of the strip, displaced around 90% of the population and caused a catastrophic humanitarian crisis, with experts saying Gaza City is experiencing famine.",
      "On Friday, UNICEF said lifesaving therapeutic food meant for thousands of children in Gaza was stolen from four of its trucks. The statement said armed individuals approached the trucks outside their compound in Gaza City, the drivers were held at gunpoint while the food was taken.",

      "The inauguration of the restored towers by Macron, who has spearheaded reconstruction efforts since the fire on April 15, 2019, comes a day before the opening weekend, when the public can finally climb the 424 stairs to enjoy unmatched views of Paris.",
      "Nearly 30,000 visitors a day have streamed through the doors of the cathedral since its\u00a0reopening in December 2024, to see for themselves the remarkable rebirth of the great Gothic church. Macron hosted world leaders and luminaries, among them Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Britain's Prince William and then President-elect Trump at the reopening.",
      "The landmark\u00a0reconstruction of Notre Dame to its former glory marks a major success for Macron, who is politically embattled at home. He can boast of fulfilling a promise made in the wake of the fire for the restoration to be finished within half a decade.",
      "Macron was given the honor of being the first person to be given a tour around the newly restored towers, which also allows a close view of the cathedral's famous gargoyles \u2014 grotesque sculptures of mythical beasts that adorn its exterior walls.",
      "\"The towers of Notre-Dame reopen to the public,\" Macron wrote on X. \"The cathedral is regaining all its splendour and once again offers its spectacular views of Paris.\"",
      "Visitors can enjoy an approximately 45-minute tour, which begins in the south tower with an ascent to the belfry.",
      "\"This route already existed before the fire, but it has been greatly improved in many ways,\" said Philippe Jost, Macron's pointman for the reconstruction, pointing to new viewpoints and spaces for visitors.",
      "Visiting the towers will be trickier and pricier than visiting the cathedral itself. Tickets, which cost 16 euros (roughly $19) rather than the free entry for the cathedral itself, must be bought online, with only 19 people allowed in at any one time.",
      "The tickets for the first two days over the weekend sold out in just 24 minutes.",
      "The total cost of restorations neared $1 billion, Jost previously told CBS News' \"60 Minutes.\" Workers had to\u00a0stabilize the 12th-century monument, encasing it in scaffolding after it was damaged in the fire. Hundreds of artisans then used 21st-century tools such as drones and computer animation to guide reconstruction.",

      "\"He committed to the important role of the U.N., to his belief in participating there, to the challenges, the need for reform \u2014 which I think most of us would agree, there are reforms that we would like to see at the U.N. \u2014 and the importance of competing with China,\" Shaheen told reporters.",
      "During his confirmation hearing, Waltz told senators that the U.N. needs \"major\" reform, but added that there's \"good and meaningful work to be done.\"",
      "\"We should have one place in the world where everyone can talk, where China, Russia, Europe, the developing world, can come together and resolve conflicts,\" he said. \"But after 80 years, it's drifted from its core mission of peacemaking.\"",
      "Waltz told Shaheen it was \"absolutely critical\" for the U.S. to be at the table to counter China's growing influence.",

      "The European Union proposed Friday bringing forward a ban on Russian gas imports as part of a new package of sanctions aimed at sapping Moscow's war chest after pressure from President Trump.",
      "Under the measures presented for approval by the bloc's member states, the European Commission said it aims to phase out liquefied natural gas (LNG) purchases from Russia by January 2027 \u2014 one year earlier than planned.",
      "\"Russia's war economy is sustained by revenues from fossil fuels. We want to cut these revenues. So we are banning imports of Russian LNG into European markets,\" commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said. \"It is time to turn off the tap.\"",
      "The proposal comes as the United States pressures the EU to end fossil fuel imports from Russia and the bloc seeks, in turn, to persuade Mr. Trump to take a tougher stance on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. Mr. Trump has so far held back from upping pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin but said last week he was ready to do so if allies stopped buying Russian oil and hit China with tariffs.",
      "Von der Leyen did not give full details of the sanctions package, but officials told the Reuters news agency it would also target Chinese refineries, special economic zones, and Russian and central Asian banks.",
      "\"We are now going after these who fuel Russia's war, who purchase oil in breach of sanctions,\" von der Leyen said, according to Reuters. \"We target refineries, oil traders, petrochemical companies in third countries including China.\"",
      "The 27-nation EU has already banned most Russian oil under previous rounds of sanctions, slashing the share it imports from 29% in early 2021 to 2% by mid-2025. Only Hungary and Slovakia, friendly to Moscow and Mr. Trump, still buy it.",
      "The multiple rounds of European sanctions imposed since Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022 have sought to sap its war chest with everything from asset freezes to a near-complete ban on importing Russian oil.",
      "Despite a push to end decades of European dependency, Russia still supplied 19% of the EU's gas in 2024 \u2014 down from 45% before the war.

      "The Egyptian Ministry of Interior announced Thursday that four suspects had been arrested. It said that on Sept. 9 the bracelet was stolen from a safe inside the museum's restoration laboratory by a restoration specialist working at the museum.",
      "She allegedly gave it to an acquaintance who owns a sliver shop in Cairo, who then sold it to the owner of a gold workshop for the equivalent of about $3,800. That shop owner then sold it for around $4,000 to another gold workshop owner, the ministry said, who melted the bracelet down to reshape into other gold jewelry.",
      "Along with its statement, the Ministry of Interior released security camera video showing a shop owner receiving the bracelet, weighing it, and then paying one of the suspects.",
      "The ministry said all involved individuals had been placed under arrest, and the proceeds from the sale of the bracelet recovered.",
      "Social media users have voiced outrage not only that bracelet was allegedly stolen by a restoration specialist working for the museum, but that she didn't appear to recognize its true value. Many have been left lamenting the fact that the bracelet that managed to survive over 3,000 years is now gone forever.",

    "story": [
      "There is \"absolutely no evidence\" that Russia's President Vladimir Putin wants to negotiate peace in Ukraine, the outgoing head of Britain's foreign intelligence agency said Friday in a speech. Sir Richard Moore, chief of the Secret Intelligence Service, or MI6 as it is more commonly known, said Putin was \"stringing us along.\"",
      "\"He seeks to impose his imperial will by all means at his disposal. But he cannot succeed,\" Moore said. \"Bluntly, Putin has bitten off more than he can chew. He thought he was going to win an easy victory. But he \u2014 and many others \u2014 underestimated the Ukrainians.\"",
      "Moore was speaking at the British consulate in Istanbul after five years as head of MI6. He leaves the post at the end of September.",
      "During his tenure, Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, a war that has seen tens of thousands killed and still rages, principally in eastern Ukraine.",
      "Moore said the invasion had strengthened Ukrainian national identity and accelerated its westward trajectory, as well as pushing Sweden and Finland to join NATO.",
      "\"Putin has sought to convince the world that Russian victory is inevitable. But he lies. He lies to the world. He lies to his people. Perhaps he even lies to himself,\" Moore told a news conference.",
      "He said that Putin was \"mortgaging his country's future for his own personal legacy and a distorted version of history\" and the war was \"accelerating this decline.\"",
      "Speaking Thursday during a state visit to the U.K., President Trump voiced frustration with Putin, saying he had hoped the war in Ukraine would be easy to end \u2014 as he suggested it would before taking office \u2014\u00a0 \"because of my relationship with President Putin,\" but that the Russian leader had \"really let me down.\"",
      "That remark came about a month after Mr. Trump met with Putin in Alaska, and said after their summit that he believed the Russian leader wanted to end the war.",
      "Moore, who previously served as the U.K.'s ambassador to Ankara, the Turkish capital, added that \"greater powers than Russia have failed to subjugate weaker powers than Ukraine.\"",
      "Analysts say Putin believes he can outlast the political commitment of Ukraine's Western partners and win a protracted war of attrition by wearing down Ukraine's smaller army with sheer weight of numbers.",
      "Ukraine, meanwhile, is racing to expand its defense cooperation with other countries and secure billions of dollars of investment in its domestic weapons industry.",
      "Recruiting digital spies",
      "Moore's speech came as the U.K. foreign office announced the launch of a new dark web portal by MI6 aimed at recruiting \"new agents in Russia and around the world.\"",
      "Called \"Silent Courier,\" the U.K. government said the portal would harness the anonymity of the dark web and allow \"anyone in the world with access to sensitive information relating to terrorism or hostile intelligence activity to securely contact the U.K. and offer their services.\"",
      "The U.K. foreign office said instructions for how to access the portal would be available on its YouTube channel, and that it was modeled on a similar approach taken by the United States Central Intelligence Agency.",
      "\"We're asking those with sensitive information on global instability, international terrorism or hostile state intelligence activity to contact MI6 securely online,\" Moore said during his speech in Istanbul, according to a foreign office statement. \"Our virtual door is open to you.\"",

      "The Taliban released a British couple on Friday who had been held in Afghanistan for more than seven months on undisclosed charges, officials said. It appeared to be part of efforts by the Taliban to be recognized internationally as the legitimate government of Afghanistan more than four years after they retook power over the country as the U.S. military pulled out.",
      "The case of Peter and Barbie Reynolds, aged 80 and 75, underlined the concerns of the West over the actions of the Taliban since they overthrew the country's U.S.-backed government in a 2021 lightning offensive. The Reynolds had lived in Afghanistan for 18 years and run an education and training organization in the country's central province of Bamiyan, choosing to remain in the country after the Taliban seized power.",
      "An official with knowledge of their release told CBS News on Friday that they were freed following mediation led by Qatar, an energy-rich nation on the Arabian Peninsula that mediated talks between the U.S. and the Taliban before the American withdrawal.",
      "The official said their freedom was secured after many months of negotiations by Qatari officials with the Taliban, working in close coordination with the British government and the couple's family.",
      "In a statement released by the U.K. government, Hamish Falconer, Minister for the Middle East, Afghanistan and Pakistan, said he was \"relieved to hear that Peter and Barbie Reynolds are no longer detained in Afghanistan, and their ordeal has come to an end. I look forward to them being reunited with their family soon.\"",
      "He said the British government had \"worked intensively since their detention and has supported the family throughout,\" and he thanked Qatar for its \"essential role in this case.\"",
      "The Reynolds were largely held separately during their detention, but the Qatari embassy in Kabul \"provided them with critical support, including access to their doctor, delivery of medication, and regular communication with their family,\" the official familiar with the case told CBS News, adding that the couple were on their way home Friday.",
      "The Reynolds' family members in the United Kingdom had repeatedly called for the couple's release, saying they were being mistreated and held on undisclosed charges. While the Taliban rejected the abuse allegations, they have never explained what prompted their detention.",
      "There was no immediate comment from the Taliban government or the U.K. Foreign Office about the couple's release.",
      "In July, United Nations human rights experts warned the couple's physical and mental health was deteriorating rapidly and that they were at risk of irreparable harm or even death.",
      "Earlier this month, the Taliban said it had reached an agreement with U.S. envoys on a prisoner exchange as part of an effort to normalize relations. The meeting came after the Taliban in March released U.S. citizen George Glezmann, who was abducted while traveling through Afghanistan as a tourist.",
      "In April, the Reynolds' American children appealed to President Trump in a video, asking for his help in securing their release.",
      "The Reynolds were detained in February along with their American friend Faye Hall and their Afghan interpreter as they traveled to the British couple's home in Bamiyan province, the family told CBS News.",
      "Hall, an U.S. citizen, was\u00a0released in the spring\u00a0into the custody of Qatari officials, who helped broker her release and return to the U.S., as the Reynolds family marked eight weeks of their parents being detained.",
      "Suhail Shaheen, the Taliban's ambassador in Qatar, told CBS News at the time that Hall was released as a \"goodwill gesture\" and that the administration \"want to have positive relations with (the) U.S. and other countries.\"",
      "Afghanistan remains a focus of President Trump. On Thursday, while visiting the U.K., Mr. Trump said the U.S. was working to regain control over the Bagram Air Base in the country.",
      "\"We're trying to get it back. Because they need things from us,\" Mr. Trump said during his state visit to Britain. \"We want that base back.\"",
      "The president said one reason the U.S. wanted control of the base is its location, calling it an \"hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons,\" apparently referring to the time it would take to fly to the unspecified location from the airfield.",
      "Zakir Jalaly, an official at the Taliban's Foreign Ministry, dismissed the idea of the U.S. regaining its control over the military installation.",

In Civitavecchia, on the coast near Rome, he aimed to reach at least 99.4 mph and then hit the brakes in time to avoid launching off the deck's so-called \"ski jump\" and smashing into the cruise ship stationed just fore.",
      "Race engineer Alessandro Tedino told The Associated Press that he wasn't sure the new record was attainable. The ship had been out at sea overnight, and the crew emerged in the early morning to find its flight deck wet. They immediately set to drying it, with the job finished by late summer sunbeams.",
      "\"If it remained wet, then of course it's impossible to have the maximum speed and best brakes. It can be very, very dangerous,\" he said.",
      "As the \"Top Gun\" theme song rang out from speakers, the carrier's portside elevator lifted Barone's team to the deck where journalists, naval officers and VIPs waited. A group of children with Down syndrome, chosen to serve as honorary \"mechanics for the day,\" removed the red, satiny cover to reveal Barone's steed: a red-and-black Ferrari SF90.",
      "Barone eased himself into the supercar, then drove back and forth along the length of the deck several times to warm up its V-8 turbo engine. It roared louder with each pass as he pushed its 1,085 horses harder and harder. Then he placed himself at the far end of the 774-foot flight deck and awaited the all-clear.",
      "\"Here he goes! Here he goes!\" the announcer called as Barone left his mark and zipped past the crowd. Mere seconds later he came to a safe stop, and the crowd applauded haltingly \u2014 impressed by the speedy spectacle, but unsure if he'd beaten the record. The official timekeeper approached the car and inspected the gauges within.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists have discovered prehistoric insects preserved in amber for the first time in South America, providing a fresh glimpse into life on Earth at a time when flowering plants were just beginning to diversify and spread around the world.",
      "Many of the specimens found at a sandstone quarry in Ecuador date to 112 million years ago, said Fabiany Herrera, curator of fossil plants at the Field Museum in Chicago and co-author of the study published Thursday in the journal Communications Earth and Environment. At least six types of arthropods were found preserved, according to the study.",
      "Almost all known amber deposits from the past 130 million years have been in the Northern Hemisphere, and it's long been \"an enigma\" that scientists have found few in southern regions that once comprised the supercontinent Gondwana, said David Grimaldi, an entomologist at the American Museum of Natural History who was not involved in the discovery.",
      "This marks the first time researchers have identified ancient beetles, flies, ants and wasps in fossilized tree resin in South America, said Ricardo P\u00e9rez-de la Fuente, a paleoentomologist at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, who also was not involved in the new study.",
      "\"Amber pieces are little windows into the past,\" P\u00e9rez-de la Fuente said, adding that the discovery will help researchers understand the evolving interactions between flowering plants and insects that lived during the era of the dinosaurs.",
      "The researchers uncovered hundreds of fragments of amber, some containing ancient insects, pollen and tree leaves, at a sandstone quarry in Ecuador that's on the edge of what is today the Amazon basin.",
      "Two types of amber were discovered, according to the study: There was a more common form of amber found around the roots of resin-producing plants, and a rarer form of the material formed from resin exposed to air. The amber formed around the roots did not hold any specimens, the study said.",
      "\"A different kind of forest\"",
      "The discoveries provide evidence that the area was once a \"humid, resinous forest ecosystem,\" according to the study.",
      "But today's rainforest is much different from what dinosaurs roamed through, Herrera said. Based on an analysis of fossils in the amber, the ancient rainforest contained species of ferns and conifers, including the unusual Monkey Puzzle Tree, that no longer grow in Amazonia.",
      "\"It was a different kind of forest,\" said Herrera.",
      "The amber deposits were previously known to geologists and miners who worked at the Genoveva quarry. Study co-author Carlos Jaramillo at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute first heard of them about a decade ago and set out to find the exact location, aided by geology field notes.",
      "\"I went there and realized this place is amazing,\" Jaramillo said. \"There's so much amber in the mines,\" and it's more visible in the open quarry than it would be if hidden under dense layers of vegetation.",
      "Researchers will continue to analyze the amber trove to learn more about Cretaceous-era biodiversity \u2014 including the insects that contributed to evolution by feeding on flowering plants. \"Amber tends to preserve things that are tiny,\" said Grimaldi.",
      "\"It's the time when the relationship between flowering plants and insects got started,\" said P\u00e9rez-de la Fuente. \"And that turned out to be one of the most successful partnerships in nature.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 17 Sep 2025 19:56:08 -0400",
    "summary": "A new study on chimpanzees in Uganda and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire supports a theory that humans may have inherited a taste for alcohol from primate ancestors.",
    "story": [
      "In the forests of Uganda and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, chimps crowd into fig and plum trees, feasting on fruit that's sweet, soft and just a little boozy. A new study shows those daily snacks quietly add up to the equivalent of nearly two alcoholic beverages for humans.",
      "A team of scientists at University of California Berkeley and other institutions tested the fruit chimps actually snack on: figs in Uganda's canopy and the plum-like fruits on the forest floor in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Collecting the data wasn't easy \u2014 with little electricity beyond solar panels and constant humidity threatening the instruments, researchers spent three seasons hauling equipment and calibrating test kits to measure alcohol in many different tropical fruits.",
      "In the end, they found that on average, the fruit's alcohol content came in at about .3% by weight. This is kombucha-level, but when chimpanzees eat 10 pounds of fruit a day and weigh around 90 pounds, it adds up to about 14 grams of ethanol, equating to about two cocktails for a human.",
      "But don't picture chimps swinging drunkenly from the trees. To actually get drunk, they'd have to binge on fruit until their bellies ballooned, the researchers said. Instead, they're exposed to a steady low dose, a quiet buzz from nature's own fermentation process.",
      "Senior author of the paper and UC Berkeley professor of integrative biology Robert Dudley first floated the \"drunken monkey\" hypothesis in 2000, arguing that our attraction to alcohol could come from ancestral fruit-eating habits. Dudley argued that it makes sense primates would be tuned to alcohol, since their diets have long revolved around ripe fruit.",
      "\"Once you start eating, it acts as an aperitif,\" he said. \"The pleasure of association with drinking alcohol increases feeding rates.\"",
      "Other animals chase the same buzz too.",
      "\"Open a bottle of beer outside and a fruit fly appears almost instantly,\" Dudley said.",
      "Spider monkeys in Panama, slow lorises in Malaysia and even elephants have been documented consuming naturally fermented fruit or nectar.",
      "What makes this study different is that it provides the first direct chemical measurements of ethanol in the fruits that wild chimps routinely eat, and then connects those numbers to daily intake.",
      "The open question is whether chimps are actually selecting fruit for its alcohol content or just chasing sugar and calories. Either way, Dudley says the story connects to us.",
      "\"We inherited the taste for alcohol,\" Dudley said. \"Even though our diets have diversified \u2026 that bias to consume quickly when this molecule is present could still be a powerful force.\"",

      "Navalny, who crusaded against official corruption and staged massive anti-Kremlin protests as President Vladimir Putin's fiercest foe, died in the Arctic penal colony in February 2024. He was serving a 19-year sentence that he believed was politically motivated.",
      "Authorities said the politician became ill after a walk but have otherwise given few details on his death. He was 47.",
      "In a video released Wednesday, Yulia Navalnaya said biological samples from Navalny's body had been taken out of Russia and tested at two laboratories abroad. She said both laboratories concluded that Navalny had been poisoned, but had not released their findings due to \"political considerations.\" She did not provide proof or elaborate on what the alleged poison was.",
      "\"These labs in two different countries reached the same conclusion: Alexei was killed. More specifically, he was poisoned,\" Navalnaya said in the video, which was posted on social media. In the clip, she questioned the lack of video footage from the prison and showed images purported to be of Navalny's cell on the day of his death showing vomit on the floor. She did not provide direct proof that Navalny had been poisoned or that it had been carried out by prison authorities.",
      "\"I demand that the laboratories that conducted the research publish their results,\" she said. \"Stop appeasing Putin for some higher 'considerations.' You cannot placate him. While you stay silent, he does not stop,\" Navalnaya said.",
      "Navalnaya has repeatedly blamed Putin for Navalny's death, something Russian officials have vehemently denied.",
      "In a press conference Wednesday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said he was not aware of Navalnaya's statement and said that he could not comment.",
      "Navalnaya said in August 2024 that she was told by Russian investigators that Navalny died from a combination of \"a dozen different diseases\" and that he finally succumbed to arrhythmia, or an irregular heartbeat.",
      "Navalnaya disputed Russian officials' version of events and said her husband exhibited no instances of heart disease while alive.",
      "Navalny previously suffered from another poisoning in 2020, when the opposition leader fell sick on an internal flight in Russia. He was flown to Berlin while still in a coma for treatment two days later. Labs in Germany, France and Sweden, and tests by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, established that he was exposed to the Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent.",
      "Russian authorities have denied any involvement in the incident, a claim that Navalny challenged as false.",
      "While behind bars, Navalny completed a memoir, documenting his three-year battle to survive the harsh prison conditions. Last summer, a Russian court issued an\u00a0arrest warrant\u00a0for his wife. She told \"60 Minutes\" that the memoir, \"Patriot,\" represents his final act of defiance.",
      "\"It was his life. It was his every-minute job to fight with Putin's regime,\" Yulia Navalnaya told correspondent Lesley Stahl. \"I would prefer he would fight not from the grave.\"",

    "story": [
      "Kurt the CyberGuy joins 'Fox & Friends' to share his tips to stay safe from online scammers and recent warnings on how AI toys can harm children.",
      "Buying refurbished electronics sounds like a no-brainer. You get the latest gadgets at a fraction of the cost while giving devices a second life, which is better for the environment. It seems like the perfect solution for those on a budget, but it isn't always that simple. Not every refurbished device is equal, and the fine print matters more than you think.",
      "Some sellers do a fantastic job restoring products, while others barely touch them before reselling. If you're considering refurbished tech, here are important lessons I wish I knew beforehand. These insights will help you make smarter choices, avoid headaches and get real value for your money.",

      "AMAZON'S SECRET RENEWED STORE DEALS: SAVE ON APPLE PRODUCTS, NINJA AIR FRYERS, SHARK VACUUMS AND MORE",
      "Researching a seller\u2019s track record is more important than chasing after the lowest refurbished price point. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Imo/Photothek via Getty Images)",
      "1) Refurbished does not always mean like new",
      "In the tech industry, the label refurbished carries no uniform standard. From factory-certified devices that meet stringent quality checks to third-party refurbishments that address only surface-level defects, the range is vast. My experience shows that treating refurbished items as \"like new\" is a mistake. Many come with cosmetic blemishes or partially worn components, and some sellers stop at a basic reset and cleaning.",
      "The key is to scrutinize the seller's refurbishment process and request detailed specifications or photos to ensure the item is in good condition. Look for transparency about what has been repaired or replaced. A reputable refurbisher will disclose whether critical components such as screens, batteries or motherboards were replaced or simply tested.",
      "Pro tip: Many refurbishers use a grading system (A, B, C). Grade A means near new, Grade B usually has light scratches, while Grade C shows heavier wear. Knowing the grade helps set realistic expectations.",
      "2) Check the warranty and return policy",
      "One of the most overlooked yet critical aspects of buying refurbished electronics is the warranty and return policy. Through years of testing products, I've seen warranties vary wildly from generous 90-day coverage to none at all. A solid warranty is not just a formality; it's a reflection of the refurbisher's confidence in the quality of the product. Without it, you're taking a gamble.",
      "Industry best practices suggest opting for sellers who provide at least a 90-day warranty and a clear, no-hassle return window. I have consistently seen reliable refurbishers like Amazon Renewed, eBay Certified Refurbished and Back Market stand by their work with transparent policies.",
      "Also look at Apple Certified Refurbished and Dell Outlet, which are industry leaders for high-quality laptops, tablets and phones.",
      "3) Know the seller's reputation",
      "Not all sellers are equal when it comes to refurbished tech. My years covering consumer electronics have made it clear that choosing a reputable seller is more important than chasing the lowest price. Factory-certified refurbishers and authorized resellers tend to follow strict testing and quality control procedures. In contrast, independent sellers often vary in quality and reliability.",
      "I always emphasize researching the seller's history, reading verified customer reviews and ensuring they offer clear refurbishment guarantees. Established marketplaces and brand-certified stores provide additional layers of security, including dispute resolution mechanisms.",
      "Red flags include: vague warranty language, listings with only stock photos, \"open box\" items marketed as refurbished and any product sold \"as-is.\" If you see those, walk away.",
      "4) Don't forget accessories and packaging",
      "A less obvious but important consideration is the state of accessories and packaging. In industry practice, refurbished products rarely arrive in original packaging or with the full set of accessories. I've seen that some sellers ship devices with generic boxes and subpar third-party accessories or omit chargers and manuals altogether.",
      "If accessories are important to your workflow, don't assume they'll be included. Always verify the listing description and, when in doubt, ask the seller directly. Knowing exactly what comes in the box prevents surprises and ensures you don't have to hunt for compatible chargers or cables after the fact, potentially eroding any savings you initially gained.",
      "5) Battery life may not be the same",
      "A common misconception is that refurbished devices come with batteries that perform like new, but that's not the case. Batteries naturally degrade with use, and not all refurbishers replace them.",
      "Some sellers disclose battery replacement while others do not. It is critical to confirm whether the battery is new, tested or original. Otherwise, expect performance issues such as rapid discharge or failure to hold a charge. A device with a worn-out battery is rarely worth the lower upfront cost, as you'll likely need to replace the battery soon after purchase.",

      "A good warranty and return policy are essential safeguards for choosing refurbished devices. (Dhiraj Singh/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "6) Software updates and compatibility",
      "You should only use electronic items like phones, laptops, tablets and smartwatches as long as they're receiving software updates. Many might disagree with this, but the truth is that once software support ends, your device becomes vulnerable to all kinds of unpatchable security flaws. Some good brands known for reliable software support are Apple, Samsung, Google, MSI and Lenovo.",
      "Before purchasing, always verify that the device is still supported with regular updates. This information is often available on the manufacturer's website or through trusted tech resources.",
      "7) Test the device thoroughly after purchase",
      "Testing a refurbished device thoroughly upon arrival is a best practice I've recommended repeatedly in my writing. Even trusted sellers can occasionally miss a defect. I always advise checking every essential function, such as the screen, charging port, Wi-Fi, sound and camera, within the seller's return period. Many problems won't be obvious from photos or descriptions alone.",
      "Immediate testing ensures you catch issues early enough to return or replace the product without hassle. It's a small investment of time that prevents far bigger frustrations later.",
      "And don't forget to perform your own factory reset on\u00a0iPhone,\u00a0Android,\u00a0PC or Mac to ensure no old accounts, locks or data are lingering on the device. For Apple devices, make sure \"Find My iPhone\" has been disabled before purchase, or it may be unusable.",
      "8) Install strong antivirus software",
      "Refurbished devices can sometimes carry hidden risks, especially if the previous owner didn't wipe the device properly or if the seller missed deep software issues. Installing\u00a0 strong antivirus software is essential to protect your device from malware, spyware or other security threats that may be lurking.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "9) Use a password manager",
      "Security doesn't end with antivirus protection. Many refurbished devices come with pre-installed software or misconfigured settings that could expose you to risk. One of the smartest moves you can make is using a reliable password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "10) Know the real value of your savings",
      "Refurbished doesn't always mean a bargain. As a rule of thumb, expect to save 20-40% compared to new, depending on the brand, age and condition. If you're only saving 10-15%, the trade-off on warranty, lifespan or battery may not be worth it. Calculate the long-term cost, especially if you'll need to buy a new battery or accessories soon after.",

      "Refurbished products often arrive without original packaging or accessories, leaving buyers unprepared. (Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Bonus: The eco-friendly upside",
      "Every refurbished device purchased keeps one more gadget out of the landfill and reduces carbon emissions from manufacturing. Studies show buying refurbished can cut a product's carbon footprint nearly in half. That means you're not only saving money but also helping the planet.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Buying refurbished electronics can be a great way to save money and reduce e-waste. But it pays to be careful. By sticking with certified sellers, knowing what \"refurbished\" really means and insisting on warranties and clear return policies, you can protect both your wallet and your data.",

      "Opt for mobile boarding passes instead of printed ones. This removes the risk of discarded paper passes falling into the wrong hands.",
      "Avoid printing your full home address or primary phone number. Instead, use your name, a travel-only email and either a P.O. box or work address. You can even create a simple alias email just for travel, which forwards to your main inbox but keeps your real address private. This way, airlines and honest finders can still reach you without exposing sensitive personal details to scammers.",
      "For recommendations on private and secure email providers that offer alias addresses, visit\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Another way to protect yourself is by putting a small tracker inside your luggage, such as an\u00a0Apple AirTag or a\u00a0similar Bluetooth tracker. These devices connect to your phone and let you see where your bag is in near real-time. If your suitcase goes missing or ends up in the wrong place, you\u2019ll know faster than waiting for the airline to track it down.",
      "Place the tracker inside your bag rather than on the handle so it can\u2019t be easily removed. Check its location through your phone before leaving the airport, and keep an eye on it during layovers. While AirTags can\u2019t prevent someone from misusing an old luggage tag, they give you proof of where your bag actually is if you ever need to dispute a lost luggage claim or theft.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "While the luggage tag scam may not be widespread yet, it exploits a simple oversight that most travelers rarely consider. Until airlines and airports put better safeguards in place, the burden falls on passengers to protect their own information.

      "Apple Watch Series 11 now includes FDA-cleared hypertension notification. (Apple)",
      "Apple Watch hypertension alerts explained",
      "Hypertension is often called the \"silent killer\" because it can strike without symptoms. Left unchecked, it increases the risk of heart attack, stroke and kidney disease. By adding passive blood pressure monitoring, Apple Watch aims to help millions detect early warning signs.",
      "Using its optical heart sensor, the watch reviews how your blood vessels respond to heartbeats over 30-day periods. If it detects consistent patterns of hypertension, you'll get a notification. Apple expects the feature could alert more than 1 million people with undiagnosed hypertension in its first year alone.",
      "Apple Watch sends users a \"Possible Hypertension\" alert when heart data shows consistent signs of elevated blood pressure. Paired with the iPhone, users can log blood pressure and follow up with doctors. (Apple)",
      "Clinical validation of Apple Watch hypertension feature",
      "Apple built the new hypertension notification feature on a foundation of years of health research. Since the launch of Apple Watch, heart health tools like ECG, AFib History and irregular rhythm notifications have helped users catch issues early. The hypertension notification now extends that mission by addressing one of the most common and dangerous silent conditions.",
      "The feature works in the background during waking hours, analyzing photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, changes in blood volume under the skin, to detect patterns that suggest chronic high blood pressure. You do not need to calibrate the feature or take direct blood pressure readings with the watch. Instead, the device tracks signals over 30 days and sends a notification if consistent signs of hypertension appear.",
      "CAN YOUR APPLE WATCH DETECT PREGNANCY?",
      "Study results confirm accuracy of hypertension alerts",
      "Apple developed the algorithm using data from more than 100,000 study participants across diverse ages, races, body types, and health statuses. The company then validated its accuracy through a pivotal clinical study with over 2,000 participants, who wore Apple Watch alongside an at-home cuff to compare results.",
      "The validation study showed the feature achieved a specificity rate above 92%, meaning it minimized false positives. Sensitivity rates were especially strong for Stage 2 hypertension, the more severe form of the condition, where the feature identified more than half of users at risk. That accuracy could help prevent strokes, heart attacks and kidney disease in those who may not otherwise know they have hypertension.",
      "Importantly, the study confirmed that the feature performed consistently across age groups, genders, races and skin tones, making it reliable for Apple's global user base. Apple also ran usability testing to fine-tune onboarding and notification language so people understand the alerts and what actions to take next.",
      "By passively monitoring and flagging possible signs of hypertension, Apple Watch helps fill a dangerous gap in diagnosis. Hypertension often goes unnoticed for years, but now, you can be alerted within just one month of wearing the watch.",

    "summary": "New research shows how fatty acids in cooking oil can safely dissolve and recover silver from circuit boards without harmful chemicals or environmental damage.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out whats clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "What if your old bottle of cooking oil could help save the planet and your smartphone? That's the big idea behind a groundbreaking discovery by researchers in Finland.",
      "Scientists from the University of Helsinki and the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 have found that you can recover silver from electronic waste using common kitchen ingredients like vegetable oil and hydrogen peroxide. This sustainable, scalable method published in the Chemical Engineering Journal could change how we mine precious metals from our growing piles of electronic junk.",

      "OLD SMARTPHONES ARE BEING TURNED INTO TINY DATA CENTERS",
      "Scientists have discovered a new method of silver extraction from electronics by using cooking oil. (Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "How cooking oil recovers silver from electronic waste",
      "Here's how it works. Fatty acids found in oils like sunflower or olive oil are mixed with hydrogen peroxide. When heated slightly, this combo safely dissolves silver from old circuit boards, wires or keyboard connectors. Then, using ethyl acetate, a far less toxic alternative to industrial solvents, researchers pull out the silver in a solid form. Unlike traditional methods that rely on harsh acids or cyanide-based solutions, this technique avoids toxic runoff and air pollution. Think of it as salad dressing meets science lab, without the environmental mess.",
      "Why recycling silver from e-waste is urgently needed",
      "Silver powers the devices you use every day, such as phones, solar panels, electric vehicles and even medical tech. But less than 20% of it gets recycled. As demand rises and natural resources shrink, finding clean ways to reclaim silver isn't just smart, it's necessary. Silver prices have surged sixfold in the last 25 years. At the same time, supply has lagged. That makes e-waste a goldmine, literally, for anyone who can unlock its hidden metals without poisoning the environment.",

      "Fatty acids found in cooking oil can stabilize silver ions for easier extraction. (Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images)",
      "How scientists extract silver using fatty acids and light",
      "To figure out exactly how this all works, researchers used advanced computer models to study how fatty acids interact with silver ions. The process not only stabilizes the silver but also allows for easy recovery using light and simple solvents. Better still, the ingredients can be reused, and there's no chemical waste or massive cost. And it's highly selective. The method targets silver while leaving other metals behind, a major step forward in urban mining. In testing, even silver-coated keyboard connectors were cleanly processed into pure elemental silver powder using this system.",
      "Indian laborers sift through a heap of pre-owned mobile phones in an electronic waste workshop Dec. 5, 2023, in New Delhi, India.\u00a0 (Yawar Nazir/Getty Images)",
      "What this means for you",
      "This research brings us closer to safe, at-home or small-scale recycling kits that could recover silver from old gadgets. Recyclers and manufacturers could adopt this method to reduce chemical waste and operating costs, while protecting workers and the environment. This method supports a future where nothing goes to waste. It keeps valuable materials in use, cutting down the need for mining and pollution. Silver is vital for making many of the tech items we use every day. Reusing it responsibly means cleaner energy at a lower cost and less reliance on mined resources.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "We've long known that waste is a problem. Now, it might also be the solution. By turning everyday ingredients into powerful recycling tools, scientists are showing us what's possible when chemistry and sustainability meet.

      "After President Donald Trump announced that he was designating the leftist agitation group Antifa as a terrorist organization in the wake of the assassination of Charlie Kirk, one expert said the president has \"powerful\" tools at his disposal to dismantle the group.",
      "Michael Balboni is an attorney and former member of the New York State Assembly and Senate. During his time in office, he chaired the state senate's Homeland Security Committee, and was later appointed to the state's Domestic Terrorism Task Force under Governors Andrew Cuomo and Kathy Hochul.",
      "U.S. terrorism laws under the Immigration and Nationality Act only apply to foreign groups, so there is no federal statute for prosecuting domestic organizations as terrorists. Trump still has a tool available to combat Antifa, though, in the form of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).",

      "\"RICO doesn't relate only to one specific act and one specific time,\" Balboni told Fox News Digital. \"It could be an analysis of an ongoing criminal enterprise.\"",
      "He explained that for a defendant to be convicted under the RICO Act, there must be an existence of an enterprise, a pattern of racketeering activity within the past decade, a demonstration that the threat of continued criminal behavior exists and that the defendant must be associated with or employed by the enterprise.",
      "\"Perhaps you could even use RICO or other statutes to try to do an enterprise-wide roll-up of these individuals, whether or not you need to designate them as a terrorist group,\" Balboni said, adding that it's a \"very powerful tool.\"",
      "But, he warned, the Trump administration will have to be very careful not to impede upon the First Amendment rights of Americans who are peacefully protesting, versus far-left groups who commit violent acts like many across the country did in the wake of George Floyd's 2020 death or the anti-ICE riots in Los Angeles earlier this year.",

      "Citing Trump's past record, Balboni thinks that the president has a high probability of success in using current laws to make a significant impact to combat Antifa's operations.",
      "\"So this is what President Trump has been able to do successfully,\" he said. \"He's been able to take a concept and then kind of take the existing laws and wrap it around the concept.\"",

      "In what would be a long-term fix to control domestic terrorism, Balboni noted that Congress could pass a law against terrorism that includes domestic enemies separately from the anti-terror law in the Immigration and Nationality Act. They could also amend the current law to include domestic terrorists.",

That belongs to the adequate judicial entities, namely, the International Court of Justice.\" Guterres said, \"the truth is that this is something that it is morally, politically, and legally intolerable.\"",
      "In a statement to Fox News Digital, a State Department spokesperson condemned the world body for the report: \"Accusing Israel of genocide is the height of hypocrisy. Oct. 7 was a genocidal event undertaken by a terrorist organization with openly genocidal ambitions. Israel went to war in self-defense and has consistently taken steps to minimize civilian casualties. That is not a genocide. This kind of equivocation by the U.N. is further evidence of its moral bankruptcy.",
      "The spokesperson confirmed that the U.S. did not provide funding to the COI, and would not preview sanctions against its members, but noted, \"Ensuring that foreign visitors to the United States do not pose a threat to U.S. national security or public safety remains a paramount priority of the U.S. government. Due to visa confidentiality and other considerations, we do not have anything to announce regarding these specific cases.\"",
      "Bayefsky, however, said that while \"U.S. law withholds funds for the COI, but clearly it has not had the intended impact.\" She argued it is \"high time\" to do a \"lot more to terminate the dangers that the U.N. and its COI pose to both the United States and Israel.\"",

      "It was a decades-old, German-made rifle built for use by the military in both World Wars, according to multiple law enforcement sources familiar with the investigation. So old that it may have been brought into the U.S. before laws were enacted in the 1960s requiring guns to be affixed with serial numbers or other marks to enable tracing.",
      "There are believed to be millions of such weapons in homes across America.",
      "Fortunately for investigators, the alleged shooter was identified through other means \u2014 his family \u2014 who convinced him to surrender to police. But the alleged use of such a vintage weapon has raised fears among some former federal agents of the potential for other would-be assassins to seek out these powerful, accurate and hard-to-trace firearms.",
      "\u201cShort of the security afforded to the president, there\u2019s no way to defend against the threat posed by this,\u201d said Scott Sweetow, a retired official with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.",
      "The suspect, Tyler Robinson, surrendered to authorities one day after Kirk was killed at an event on the Utah Valley University campus. According to alleged text messages shared by prosecutors in charging documents, Robinson told his roommate and romantic partner, who is transgender, that he killed Kirk because he \u201chad enough of his hatred.\u201d",
      "Robinson, 22, who has been charged with aggravated murder and six other counts, had recently become \u201cmore pro-gay and trans-rights oriented,\u201d according to prosecutors.",
      "A public memorial service for Kirk, the hugely popular but also polarizing founder of the conservative group Turning Point USA, will be held Sunday in Arizona.",
      "A popular bolt-action rifle",
      "Prosecutors identified the recovered gun as a Mauser model 98. The .30-06 caliber rifle, which fires cartridges slightly smaller than 8 millimeters, had belonged to Robinson\u2019s grandfather, prosecutors said.",
      "The authorities have not revealed how they believe Robinson\u2019s grandfather obtained the gun or whether they were able to successfully trace it. An ATF spokesman declined to comment to NBC News.",
      "The gun is a bolt-action rifle, which requires users to manually reload between shots. A person must pull the bolt to the rear and then move it forward in order to move a new round into place and fire again.",
      "Following the wars in Europe, countless American GIs returned home with German-made Mausers. In subsequent years, Mauser rifles and other similar versions could be obtained simply by ordering them through the mail.",
      "For decades, they have been favored by hunters who prize them for their durability, reliability and accuracy. With .30-06 rounds, they are ideal weapons to take down medium to large game like deer, elk and even bear.",
      "But it is exceedingly rare for them to be used in crimes, according to former ATF gun agents and federal reports. Most gun violence in America is carried out with pistols, and semiautomatic AR-15-style rifles have been used to commit some of the nation\u2019s deadliest mass shootings.",
      "\u201cA bolt-action rifle? You don\u2019t see those guns used in violent crimes,\u201d said Tim Sloan, a former ATF agent who retired as the head of its Mexico branch.",
      "That\u2019s because they can\u2019t be as easily concealed as handguns and they\u2019re not designed to spray a large volume of bullets at once, experts say.",
      "But they are, in some ways, ideally suited for use in sniper-style killings. Because they are so ubiquitous and beloved by hunters and recreational shooters, a person toting such a rifle in a place like Utah would not arouse any suspicion.",
      "And they are so well made that, with a decent scope, a person with basic firearm proficiency can strike a target from 150 to 200 yards away, roughly the distance of the shot fired by the Kirk assassin.",
      "\u201cYou do not have to have gone to sniper school or have been any type of champion marksmen,\u201d said Brian Greco, a retired NYPD officer who served in the counterterrorism unit and a Marine Corps veteran.",
      "Despite their age, vintage Mauser rifles like the one authorities say was used to kill Kirk are widely available at firearm stores, pawn shops and gun shows, experts said. They can also be modified to accommodate different rounds, scopes and lighter stocks made of fiberglass.",
      "\u201cThe basic, plain-Jane Mausers \u2014 you can go to any gun show in America and see these things for a few hundred dollars,\u201d said Sweetow, the retired ATF official. \u201cThe heavily customized versions can go for thousands.\u201d",
      "Echoes of Kennedy assassination",
      "The use of a decades-old, European military surplus rifle to kill Kirk echoes one of America\u2019s most infamous crimes: the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963.",
      "The killer, Lee Harvey Oswald, used a Carcano model 38, a bolt-action rifle originally designed in the late 19th century for the Italian military. He obtained it by mail order through an advertisement in a gun magazine.",
      "The killing helped to usher in the Gun Control Act of 1968, which among other things required firearms to be sold by federally licensed dealers, to have markings to enable tracing, and for paperwork to be filled out identifying the buyer.",
      "Gun control advocates have long been pushing for more restrictions, such as a ban on semiautomatic, military-style firearms like AR-15s. But they acknowledge that such a ban would not cover a bolt-action rifle like the Mauser 98.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a hunting rifle, and people hunt legitimately,\u201d said Greg Lickenbrock \u2014 author of the book \u201cSafe Gun Ownership for Dummies\u201d and a senior firearms analyst for Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun-control group founded by Mike Bloomberg.",
      "He said the use of this kind of gun in a violent crime highlights the gaps in law enforcement\u2019s ability to track down the owners.",
      "\u201cThis is a very obvious example of the tracing system having huge holes in it,\u201d Lickenbrock added.",
      "That view is shared even by some who believe strongly in the Second Amendment.",
      "\u201cI am definitely not a \u2018more government\u2019 type of person, but as someone who takes firearms safety seriously and has worked with firearms for 30 years through the Marine Corps, NYPD and now as an armed guard for a Long Island school district, I do feel there has to be accountability to these older and unserialized firearms,\u201d Greco said.",
      "\u201cA vintage firearm in grandpa\u2019s old trunk is cool,\u201d he added, \u201cbut it also unfortunately gives access to a firearm to someone who may otherwise have not had access or could have been denied access.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Disney is under siege from all sides.",
      "Within 48 hours of its decision to pull late-night host Jimmy Kimmel off the air indefinitely, the parent company of ABC has once again found itself at the center of a bitter political battle. The company now faces protests outside its studios, celebrities threatening to break ties and political pressure from Republicans and Democrats.",
      "Kimmel\u2019s removal came Wednesday after he commented on Charlie Kirk\u2019s killing. ABC\u2019s decision has further amplified a free speech debate that began in the immediate aftermath of Kirk\u2019s assassination, with some on the left claiming that people on the right were engaging in the \u201ccancel culture\u201d they once said they loathed. Others on the right sought to dub Kimmel\u2019s removal as \u201cconsequence culture.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Disney did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.",
      "The blowback has been swift. Damon Lindelof, creator of ABC\u2019s \u201cLost,\u201d said in an Instagram post on Thursday that he would not work with the company if Kimmel\u2019s suspension was not lifted. The Emmy-winning showrunner has a long-standing relationship with the studio, having worked with them on \u201cLost\u201d for six seasons from 2004 to 2010.",
      "Tatiana Maslany, who starred in Marvel\u2019s \u201cShe-Hulk: Attorney at Law,\u201d which aired its first and only season on Disney+ in 2022, posted a call to her followers on Instagram to \u201ccancel your @disneyplus @hulu @espn subscriptions!\u201d",
      "Many of those in Trump\u2019s camp, including Trump himself, are not backing down. Trump on Thursday posted to Truth Social a clip of Kimmel at the Academy Awards reading out a real-time critique from Trump on his hosting, adding: \u201cHe made a total FOOL of himself, his wife and agent begging him not to do it, while also proving to be one of the Worst Hosts in the History of the Academy Awards.\"",
      "Some other well-followed media personalities saw Disney\u2019s move as a reasonable response to what Kimmel said. Dave Portnoy, the founder of Barstool Sports who has at times been critical of Trump, posted on X that the suspension was not an example of cancel culture.",
      "\u201cThat is consequences for your actions,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Vice President JD Vance on Friday afternoon offered a fresh barb at Kimmel and downplayed free speech concerns.",
      "\u201cJimmy Kimmel wasn\u2019t funny, his ratings were in the toilet, and his advertisers were revolting,\u201d Vance posted on X. \u201cAlso the bellyaching from the left over \u2018free speech\u2019 after the Biden years fools precisely no one.\u201d",
      "The news that Kimmel\u2019s show would be removed from the airwaves came on Wednesday evening, two days after the late-night host criticized some for how they responded to Kirk\u2019s killing. Text messages from suspect Tyler Robinson, released Tuesday by authorities, allegedly said he targeted Kirk because Robinson \u201chad enough of his hatred.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe MAGA gang [is] desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,\u201d Kimmel said during the Monday broadcast.",
      "The move to \u201cindefinitely\u201d pre-empt Kimmel\u2019s show came hours after Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr threatened to \u201ctake action\u201d against both Disney and ABC over the comments, including threats to pull ABC affiliate licenses.",
      "Nexstar Media Group Inc. \u2014 which has more than 200 stations in the United States and is waiting on FCC approval for a $6.2 billion acquisition of smaller, rival TV company Tegna \u2014 said it was pulling \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d for the foreseeable future, starting Wednesday night.",
      "Since then, many actors, writers and comedians have voiced and continue to voice their support for Kimmel. Outside Disney\u2019s studios in Burbank, California, hundreds of people took part Thursday in a protest led by the Writers Guild of America and co-organized with the group Burbank Against ICE.",
      "On Friday, Michael Eisner, the ex-CEO of Disney, appeared to criticize his former company.",
      "\u201cWhere has all the leadership gone? If not for university presidents, law firm managing partners, and corporate chief executives standing up against bullies, who then will step up for the first amendment?,\u201d Eisner wrote on X, calling Carr\u2019s actions \u201cyet another example of out-of-control intimidation.\u201d",
      "In a series of posts on X, Carr has maintained that the decision stemmed from local stations making \u201cprogramming decisions\u201d that are \u201cresponsive to the local communities they serve\u201d \u2014 something he claims Kimmel\u2019s show was not doing.",
      "\u201cBroadcasters have long retained the right to not air national programs that they believe are inconsistent with the public interest, including their local communities\u2019 values,\u201d Carr wrote in another post.",
      "Carr\u2019s role in Kimmel\u2019s removal also has caused some concern on the right.",
      "Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, on Friday became among the most high-profile conservatives to decry Carr\u2019s comments, saying on his podcast that what Kimmel said was wrong but also that what Carr was doing was \u201cunbelievably dangerous,\u201d most notably threatening the broadcast licenses of ABC affiliates (which Trump has also threatened).",
      "\u201cI like Brendan Carr. He\u2019s a good guy. He\u2019s the chairman of the FCC. I work closely with him, but what he said there is dangerous as hell,\u201d Cruz added.",
      "Some right-leaning voices in the comedy community have broken partisan lines to criticize what they say is an attack on free speech.",
      "In an Instagram post, podcaster and comedian Tim Dillon said Kimmel should still be on the air and called his suspension \u201ca politically motivated hit job.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnyone who cares about the ability to speak freely for a living should be disturbed by this,\u201d Dillon said.",
      "Screenshots of Instagram stories posted by comedians Andrew Schulz and Sam Morril on Thursday also appeared to push back against Kimmel\u2019s suspension.",
      "\u201cThe Epstein list won\u2019t be released but Jimmy Kimmel will be?\u201d Morril wrote.",
      "Many of Kimmel\u2019s late-night peers have also come to his defense, with Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert \u2014 whose show was recently canceled \u2014 mocking Trump on Thursday night in relation to Kimmel\u2019s suspension.",
      "In recent years, Disney has found itself dragged into a number of politically charged battles \u2014 and lawsuits. In 2024, the company settled litigation with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis that started after it opposed the state\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill.",
      "In 2025, Disney and its subsidiary Lucasfilm, which is behind the \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise, settled a lawsuit with actor Gina Carano after she claimed she was wrongfully terminated from \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d TV series for expressing right-wing views on social media. In some of her posts, made in previous years, Carano had likened modern political divides to the Holocaust and mocked people who wore masks during the pandemic. In a statement after the settlement was reached, Lucasfilm said, \u201cWith this lawsuit concluded, we look forward to identifying opportunities to work together with Ms. Carano in the near future.\u201d",
      "More recently, Disney\u2019s ABC News also settled a defamation lawsuit with Trump, paying $15 million to his future presidential museum or foundation.",
      "Disney CEO Bob Iger has countered the narrative that Disney has bent toward either political party\u2019s ideologies.",
      "In 2023, he said the company\u2019s movies had been too focused on \u201cmessaging\u201d when they should be focused on entertaining, in an effort to improve the quality of Disney\u2019s movies. The following year, Iger said his primary mission for the company was to entertain versus focusing on the \u201cwoke agenda.\u201d",
      "\u201cI like being able to entertain if you can infuse it with positive messages and have a good impact on the world. Fantastic. But that should not be the objective. When I came back, what I have really tried to do is to return to our roots,\u201d he said.",
      "In addition to Lindelof\u2019\u2019s and Maslany\u2019s calls to push back on Disney and its products, other Disney boycott calls have percolated online in the last couple days, though it\u2019s not clear how widespread it has been or if it will have a lasting effect on the company.",
      "A number of celebrities, including NSYNC band member Lance Bass and \u201cTransparent\u201d star Amy Landecker, have shared screenshots to social media that show their cancellations of their Disney-affiliated subscriptions.",
      "As the message gained traction over the last day across social media sites, Google Trends showed an uptick of searches for the terms \u201ccancel Disney Plus\u201d and \u201cboycott Disney,\u201d as posters declared they were leaving the streaming platforms behind.",
      "Bill Simmons, a popular podcast host and friend of Kimmel\u2019s who also used to work on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!,\u201d said in a podcast posted early Friday that he thought there was a good chance the show would get canceled, but that pushback against Kimmel\u2019s suspension had caused him to reconsider.",
      "\u201cWhat changed over the last 24 plus hours is there was such a groundswell,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cThis just felt like this became the moment. If we stand by and let something like this happen, what\u2019s next? Where do we go?\u201d"

      "\u201cHe pretends he\u2019s a fiscal conservative, but this is $4 trillion of new debt,\u201d said his likely Democratic challenger, Janelle Stelson, a former local news anchor who is seeking a rematch against Perry in 2026. \u201cI mean, the next generation is really going to struggle with this. We\u2019re mortgaging our children\u2019s future with that $4 trillion.\u201d",
      "Perry\u2019s a \u201cfraud,\u201d Stelson added. \u201cThis is a really rotten vote that\u2019s really going to hurt people.\u201d",
      "Stelson is just one of a handful of Democratic candidates turning the tables on vulnerable Republicans this cycle on the issue of rising deficits \u2014 a campaign issue that helped propel House Republicans to power in the 2010 Tea Party wave and which the GOP has consistently returned to in more recent elections.",
      "In Wisconsin, Democratic challenger Rebecca Cooke is attacking GOP Rep. Derrick Van Orden for \u201cplunging our country into debt to appease Trump and billionaires.\u201d In Iowa, Democrat Christina Bohannan said Republican Rep. Mary Miller-Meeks \u201cvoted to blow up the national debt by 3.4 trillion dollars\u201d and that \u201cIowa can\u2019t afford another term of MMM in DC.\u201d",
      "And in New Jersey, Democrat Rebecca Bennett is going after GOP Rep. Tom Kean Jr., saying he \u201cchose to make life harder for families by raising costs, exploding the national debt and ripping healthcare away from 20,000 people across our district.\u201d",
      "Republicans argue that the $4 trillion estimate by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office is grossly overstated and fails to take into account that revenue generated from the bill\u2019s policies would boost economic growth and help fill government coffers.",
      "\u201cIf you explain it the right way, [Trump\u2019s law] actually is intended to reduce the deficit over time,\u201d Rep. Young Kim, who has frequently spoken out about the national debt, told NBC News. \u201cWe can\u2019t do it overnight, but the fact [is] that we\u2019re doing it incrementally.\u201d",
      "Kim, a vulnerable Republican representing California\u2019s Orange County, has faced criticism from one in a large field of Democrats hoping to unseat her, with Democrat Esther Kim Varet, a Los Angeles art dealer, labeling her a \u201chypocrite\u201d for voting to \u201cballoon the national debt to $40,000,000,000,000.00.\u201d",
      "But Kim said Democrats and the media covering the CBO score have it wrong. \u201cContrary to what you guys are reporting, it is actually helping to reduce the deficit over time,\u201d Kim said. \u201cSo people understand that.\u201d",
      "And House Republicans\u2019 campaign officials said their incumbents won\u2019t be lectured by a Democratic Party that saw the national debt climb by trillions of dollars during the Biden administration. During his Senate confirmation hearing, Russell Vought, Trump\u2019s pick for budget director, testified that the federal debt climbed $8.4 trillion under Joe Biden, but also $7.8 trillion during Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "\u201cDemocrats spent years maxing out the nation\u2019s credit card on Biden\u2019s reckless spending spree, and now they want to lecture Republicans on fiscal responsibility?\u201d asked Mike Marinella, a spokesman for the House GOP\u2019s campaign operation, the National Republican Congressional Committee. \u201cRepublicans are delivering tax relief, economic growth, and real deficit reduction, while Democrats can\u2019t erase their long record of blanket support for endless spending to push their crazy, radical wish list and endless opposition to middle-class tax cuts.\u201d",
      "In two brief interviews at the Capitol, Perry conceded that he wasn\u2019t happy that the Trump law would add to the deficit. \u201cObviously, I don\u2019t like that,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, Washington, D.C., is often about compromise, and the things that you don\u2019t love about a piece of legislation you have to accept for the things that you do want.\u201d",
      "But he argued that he and others in the Freedom Caucus helped secure changes to the Trump legislation that brought its cost down by more than $1 trillion \u2014 imposing work requirements for Medicaid recipients, restricting food assistance for certain legal residents and rolling back clean energy tax credits from Joe Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "The new law extended the 2017 Trump tax cuts, which were set to expire at the end of this year, and that outweighs any of the bill\u2019s negative impacts, Perry said.",
      "\u201cPutting thousands and thousands of dollars in taxes on our citizens was not going to help them, the economy,\u201d Perry told NBC News. \u201cAnd remember, I\u2019m one of the guys that fought to take it from $300 billion [in cuts over 10 years] to $1.6 trillion. It\u2019s not enough, but that\u2019s a pretty good effort.",
      "\u201cPeople didn\u2019t send me to Washington to raise their taxes, but they also didn\u2019t send me to bankrupt their country,\u201d he added.",
      "Told that Stelson has been referring to him as a fiscal \u201cfraud,\u201d Perry suggested that she\u2019s an empty suit who is recycling talking points from Democratic campaign operatives.",
      "\u201cYou should ask her to explain anything that she just said, because she\u2019s being fed responses or quotes from the party that\u2019s running her campaign,\u201d Perry said, \u201cand she has no idea what she\u2019s talking about.\u201d",
      "The race in Pennsylvania\u2019s 10th District, based in the state capital of Harrisburg, will be one of the most closely watched this cycle as Democrats try to win back control of the lower chamber \u2014 and secure a check on Trump.",
      "In 2024, Perry edged out Stelson, 50.6% to 49.4%, or by just 5,133 votes out of more than 400,000 cast.",
      "An Iraq War veteran and former state lawmaker, Perry arrived in Washington in 2013. Like many in his party at the time, he warned about rising deficits and debt in the wake of Democrats\u2019 passage of the Affordable Care Act. He later served for one term as chairman of the Freedom Caucus, created to pull the GOP conference further to the right, especially on spending matters.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s complete hypocrisy,\u201d said fellow Pennsylvania Rep. Brendan Boyle, the top Democrat on the Budget Committee. \u201cBesides this bill being the greatest loss of health care in American history, it\u2019s also the single greatest increase to our national debt in American history. Every single Republican, with the exception of two, voted completely contrary to their principles and voted for what is really a debt bomb.\u201d",
      "Other endangered swing-district Republicans are facing similar attacks. In Arizona, Democrat Marlene Gal\u00e1n-Woods, who is running in the primary to take on vulnerable GOP Rep. David Schweikert in the wealthy Phoenix suburbs, has referred to him as a \u201chypocrite in chief\u201d over his support for the Trump bill.",
      "\u201cHis hypocrisy is deafening as this \u2018fiscal conservative\u2019 \u2018deficit hawk\u2019 supports a bill that adds trillions to the debt. He\u2019s got to go,\u201d Gal\u00e1n-Woods, a former broadcast journalist, posted on X.",
      "Schweikert rode the 2010 Tea Party wave to Washington and was one of the founding members of the Freedom Caucus, but left the group in 2023. The wonky chairman of the bicameral Joint Economic Committee, Schweikert has given countless floor speeches and interviews on the risk of deficits and the national debt, accompanied by floor charts and graphs.",
      "In an interview, Schweikert said the CBO score showing the Trump law will add trillions to the deficit \u201cabsolutely gives me heartburn.\u201d",
      "He said as Republicans debated the legislation, he offered several amendments to pay for its price tag, including one to reform the Medicare Advantage program by tackling waste and fraud.",
      "\u201cGuess how many sponsors I have? \u2026 Zero,\u201d Schweikert said. \u201cNot a single member of Congress will sponsor my bills. Why? It has the word Medicare in it, and you\u2019ll beat the living s--- out of them if they sponsor something that has the word Medicare.\u201d",
      "In the end, he said, he voted for the bill to spare his constituents from a horrible tax increase.",
      "\u201cBut there becomes my intense frustration: I\u2019m not gonna let the taxes go up on my constituents. You didn\u2019t have a choice. In parts of my district, it would have been 3,000 bucks a year\u201d in tax hikes, Schweikert said.",
      "Officials with the National Republican Congressional Committee countered that Gal\u00e1n-Woods has praised Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The CBO initially estimated that the law would cut the deficit by $58 billion, but CBO Director Phillip Swagel told reporters this year that the IRA\u2019s clean energy tax subsidies would increase deficits by $825 billion over 10 years. A separate Goldman Sachs estimate showed those subsidies would cost $1.2 trillion over 10 years.",
      "The GOP officials also noted that Gal\u00e1n-Woods and Stelson strongly opposed extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts.",
      "Boyle, the ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee, defended the CBO from GOP attacks. He noted that Congress has oversight of that budget office, which has been led by Swagel, an assistant treasury secretary during the George W. Bush administration, since 2019.",
      "\u201cThe CBO is headed by a Republican appointee and staffed by 270 hardworking, nonpartisan government officials who simply call the balls and strikes as they see them,\u201d Boyle said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just CBO that\u2019s showing the so-called big beautiful bill will add a massive amount to the national debt \u2014 it is left-of-center groups, it is right-of-center groups and it is nonpartisan groups,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir piece of legislation pretty much united every group across the ideological spectrum that this is really a debt bomb.\u201d"

      "The federal prosecutor in charge of pursuing mortgage fraud allegations against New York Attorney General Letitia James resigned Friday after President Donald Trump said he no longer wanted him to serve in the position.",
      "Erik S. Siebert, the acting U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, announced he was stepping down in an email to colleagues that was obtained by NBC News.",
      "\"This evening, I submitted my resignation as Interim US Attorney for EDVA. For the last eight months, I have had the pleasure of leading the finest and most exceptional of DOJ employees, who care deeply about our nation and our EDVA community,\" he wrote, referring to the Eastern District of Virginia.",
      "Trump on Friday unleashed an attack on Siebert, who was tasked with pursuing mortgage fraud charges against James, a longtime Trump foe.",
      "\u201cI want him out,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office when asked if he wanted Siebert to be fired.",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment, and Siebert\u2019s office and did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Trump administration officials had been pressing Siebert to investigate potential mortgage fraud charges against James.",
      "That investigation stalled over concerns from federal agents and prosecutors who felt they lacked the evidence to obtain a conviction if the case were to go to trial, two senior federal law enforcement officials told NBC News on Wednesday.",
      "James has denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Friday, Trump \u2014 who nominated Siebert earlier this year \u2014 lamented the Senate\u2019s \u201cblue slip\u201d custom, which allowed Democratic Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner of Virginia to recommend Siebert for the position.",
      "He referred to Kaine and Warner as \u201ctwo bad guys, bad senators, too, and they do a terrible job for the people of Virginia.\u201d",
      "In a joint statement Friday, the senators criticized Trump for \u201cpushing out\u201d Siebert, whom they referred to as an \u201cethical prosecutor who refused to bring criminal charges against Trump\u2019s perceived enemies when the facts wouldn\u2019t support it.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Eastern District of Virginia is at the forefront of significant cases essential to our national security, and just like any court in America, should be focused on justice instead of a thin-skinned president\u2019s vendettas,\u201d they added.",
      "A New York appeals court last month dismissed a $500 million civil fraud judgment stemming from a case brought by James\u2019 office that had accused Trump and his companies of routinely inflating property values in financial statements.",
      "In a social media post last month lauding the court\u2019s decision, Trump referred to James as a \u201cpolitical hack\u201d and a \u201cCorrupt and Incompetent Attorney General who only brought this Case in order to hurt me politically.\u201d",
      "The investigation of James is not the first time mortgage fraud claims have been investigated by the Trump administration in connection with one of Trump\u2019s perceived political foes.",
      "Mortgage fraud claims against Federal Reserve board member Lisa Cook have also been referred to the Justice Department by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, a Trump political appointee. Trump has cited those allegations as a justification for her firing and has asked the Supreme Court to weigh in. Cook has denied the mortgage allegations and declined to leave her position on the board."

      "Andrew Salgado knew college wasn\u2019t for him.",
      "Still, after graduating high school in 2023, he was set to enroll in an accounting program at a local technical college a few months later because he thought he had to.",
      "\u201cI was the guy who figured, \u2018OK, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing, but I can\u2019t not go to college,\u2019\u201d said Salgado, 20, who lives just outside of Tampa, Florida.",
      "But just weeks before he was set to start, Salgado\u2019s mother convinced him to switch his major to a skilled trade by highlighting the opportunities across industries for someone with a problem-solving personality like his own.",
      "After scouring social media for days for videos about various trade jobs, Salgado soon landed on HVAC, or heating, ventilation and air conditioning, because of his desire to help people in need. So he changed his major and eventually graduated trade school. Two years later, he\u2019s an HVAC technician who helps fix cooling units in homes. And he can\u2019t imagine himself doing anything else.",
      "\u201cI love every second of it,\u201d said Salgado.",
      "Salgado is one of a growing number of Gen Zers who are choosing careers in skilled trades. They\u2019re becoming electricians, welders and HVAC technicians because of the promise of long-term stability without having to go into major student debt.",
      "A Resume Builder survey from May, which polled 1,434 adults between the ages of 18 and 28, found that 42% of Gen Z workers say they\u2019re turning to blue collar work with the top two motivators being avoiding student debt and not being replaced by artificial intelligence.",
      "And last year, Gen Z accounted for nearly one in four new hires in skilled trade roles, despite making up just 14% of the total working population, according to Gusto, a payroll and benefits company.",
      "Many are showcasing their jobs on TikTok through \u201cday in the life\u201d videos \u2014 posting both fun and frustrating moments \u2014 while garnering millions of views. The videos offer audiences on the app, where 1 in 3 users are between the ages of 18 and 24, a window into the trades.",
      "Salgado\u2019s videos often document his entire day, from brushing his teeth before the sun rises to completing several service jobs by early evening.",
      "\u201cI just want to show the next generation, I\u2019m 18, 19, 20 years old in these videos, and if I could do it, you guys could too,\u201d he said.",
      "Adrian China, a 19-year-old electrician apprentice from New Jersey, agrees.",
      "\u201cIt feels nice to be able to inspire people and make them do better for themselves,\u201d said China, who often shares videos of electrical projects he finishes throughout the day.",
      "Some say it has changed how they view the so-called American dream.",
      "Jordan Morris, a 20-year-old HVAC tech in Richmond, Virginia, wants to work for himself. \u201cTen years from now, I want to start my own company,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cAs long as I have a family, a wife, kids \u2014 that\u2019s home for me,\u201d said Salgado. \u201cThat\u2019s the American dream.\u201d",
      "College vs. trade school",
      "Amid skyrocketing tuition costs at four-year colleges, alongside the threat of artificial intelligence taking over white-collar roles, many young people are turning to blue-collar jobs because of the lower barrier to entry.",
      "The average cost of a four-year college in the U.S. is about $108,000 over four years \u2014 a figure that has grown 45% in the last 20 years, when adjusted for inflation, according to U.S. News & World Report. In contrast, most trade schools range in duration from a few weeks of instruction to two years. The cost is a fraction of four-year colleges\u2019: from a few thousand dollars to as much as $25,000 in total. Some trade schools allow students to earn a wage while they learn, while others are fully sponsored by companies where graduates plan to work.",
      "After giving college a try twice just before the start of the Covid pandemic, Mary Millican, a 24-year-old electrician in rural Nevada, turned to a career in the trades because, she said, it allows her to have a job \u201cwhenever and wherever.\u201d",
      "So, she pivoted, dropped out of college and enrolled in power lineman school, and eventually electrician school. Now, as both an electrician and an assistant trade instructor, Millican said she posts videos of herself working on power lines or in the local mines to help encourage other young people, especially women, to get into the field.",
      "\u201cI found passion helping others on TikTok find their way in the trades,\u201d said Millican.",
      "High demand, low supply of trade professionals",
      "There are millions of unfilled skilled roles, and not enough people to fill them. The BLS estimates there are 500,000 open manufacturing jobs in the U.S., and some estimates expect that number to balloon to 2 million by 2033.",
      "Gen Z is starting to help fill that gap.",
      "Chad Phillip, an instructor at Fred\u2019s Appliance Academy, a trade school in Ohio, has seen the average age of his classes drop considerably in recent years. His latest class helps students become certified to fix a host of kitchen appliances in three weeks. The average age of a student is about 28 years old, with several 18-, 19- and 20-year-olds, he said.",
      "\u201cThe biggest thing I get from the students is that they desire to be hands on,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to sit in an office or a cubicle and do that type of work.\u201d",
      "The school promotes its classes on TikTok and Facebook, posting clips of students working on appliances in class. Between the platforms, the school has more than 50,000 followers, with some students admitting that they first learned of trades from the video clips.",
      "\u201cIt is becoming more common that a student arrives on the first day of class and they\u2019ll say, \u2018Hey I saw you on TikTok or Facebook,\u2019\u201d said Phillip.",
      "Over time, experts say, trades that have generally relied on word of mouth or employee referrals have begun drawing more young people via social media. And the data backs that up.",
      "A 2024 \u201cFuture of the Skilled Trades\u201d report by Thumbtack, a platform that connects hundreds of thousands of trade professionals to homeowners in need of home maintenance, found that 2 out of 3 Gen Zers say that social media has increased their interest in the trades. And more than half, 55%, say they would consider a career in the trades \u2014 up from the previous year, according to the poll, which surveyed 1,000 people ages 16 to 26 over two days in July last year.",
      "Marco Zappacosta, the CEO of Thumbtack and the author of the report, said social media has a way of influencing young people more than teachers and family do.",
      "Trade industries, he added, have long remained stable even as technology has evolved and have withstood economic downturns because of the in-demand services they provide.",
      "Because of this, Zappacosta said, nearly 40% of the pros who have joined Thumbtack since 2024 are under 35.",
      "\u201cWhen they look at these categories, what they see is something that is likely not going away,\u201d he said. \u201cIf your hot water heater breaks, you\u2019re gonna hire somebody to fix it.\u201d"

    "summary": "After it was barred from the Eurovision Song Contest Russia is reviving a Soviet-era version of the camp competition.",
    "story": [
      "Perhaps the Eurovision ban is starting to bite, because three years after Russia was booted from the beloved song contest following the country\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, it is reviving a Soviet-era version of the camp competition.",
      "The Intervision Song Contest will see 23 artists from around the world \u2014 including one representing the U.S. \u2014 offer a heady mix of musical styles, from moody Belarusian pop to Colombian folk and high-energy Vietnamese rap at an arena in the capital of Moscow on Saturday night.",
      "Unlike the Eurovision Song Contest, which mainly includes European countries and a few others like Australia and Israel, Intervision bills itself as a truly global event by offering artists from countries around the world, including those in the Global South, a chance to compete for the top prize of 30 million rubles (roughly $360,000).",
      "\u201cBack in the Soviet times, the government would decide to promote a positive image of Russia abroad. We need to promote an objective image. We want to be known with all our merits and shortcomings,\u201d Russia\u2019s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told a news conference this week in response to a presubmitted question from NBC News.",
      "Asked whether Russia was using the competition as an exercise in soft power, he replied, \u201cIf by soft power you mean the opportunity to let people know about us, then of course we\u2019re interested in this.\u201d",
      "A pop phenomenon drawing around 160 million viewers each May, Eurovision began at the height of the Cold War in 1956 as a technical experiment to try and broadcast a simultaneous program across the member stations of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).",
      "A divided continent had mirror organizations like the NATO defense alliance in Western Europe and the Warsaw Pact in Eastern Europe, and the EBU in the West matched by the International Radio and Television Organisation (OIRT) on the other side of the Iron Curtain.",
      "In answer to Eurovision came Intervision, which was broadcast by the OIRT on several occasions between 1965 and 1980, with contests held in what was then Czechoslovakia and later in Poland.",
      "But Dean Vuletic, who has written and edited books on Eurovision and led a research project on Intervision, says Russia is getting its history wrong with the relaunch, \u201cpresenting Intervision as something that was Russian- or Soviet-led, but it actually wasn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Instead, he said, the competitions \u201cweren\u2019t that focused on the Soviet participants,\u201d although they had to be invited. Having studied the archives of Czech and Polish TV stations, he said it was \u201castonishing how critical they are of the Soviet participants.\u201d",
      "He added that it was actually created during a period of liberalization in an attempt \u201cto promote East-West cooperation in popular music and television,\u201d and Western performers like Gloria Gaynor were invited to perform in the intervals. Performers from Eastern Europe were also hoping to be signed by Western labels, he added.",
      "Before it was kicked out in 2022 after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia was frequently a top-10 finalist at Eurovision, which Vuletic called \u201ca huge platform for cultural diplomacy for any country,\u201d big or small.",
      "The country\u2019s leaders \u201csaw it as a very prestigious cultural project and one which could reach a huge amount of people,\u201d he added.",
      "But Eurovision\u2019s embrace of LGBTQ rights drew the ire of conservative Russian lawmakers and the country\u2019s Orthodox Church, particularly after the 2014 victory of bearded drag queen Conchita Wurst.",
      "Saturday\u2019s Intervision contest is getting a full-court press promotion from organizers, who have drafted a series of celebrity \u201cambassadors\u201d to get the word out. Among them are Dima Bilan, a Russian singer who won Eurovision in 2008, and Alexander Ovechkin, the Washington Capitals hockey star, who holds the record for most goals scored in NHL history.",
      "The goal is to \u201cpromote universal, spiritual, family, cultural, ethical, and religious traditions of different nations,\u201d according to the competition\u2019s website, although that seems potentially at odds with the entrant representing the U.S., Vassy, who has a history of performing at Pride events and supporting LGBTQ rights.",
      "Vassy, an Australian-born singer living in Los Angeles, has been a vocalist on dance tracks from David Guetta and Ti\u00ebsto, while several of her own topped Billboard\u2019s Dance Club Songs chart in the 2010s.",
      "The 42-year-old, whose real name is Vasiliki Karagiorgos, was a last-minute addition to the contest after the previous selection pulled out due to \u201cunforeseen family circumstances.\u201d",
      "Her outlook is markedly different from that of Russia\u2019s entrant, Shaman, who mixes politics and pop and rose in popularity after he became a strident supporter of the war in Ukraine.",
      "So vocal is his backing of the Kremlin that he has ended up on Australian and European Union sanction lists.",
      "Russia will be hoping that Shaman\u2019s popularity can bring a younger audience to the contest as well as his fans, many of whom are based outside major Russian metropolises like Moscow and St. Petersburg, according to Yulia Yurtaeva-Martens, a researcher at the Free University of Berlin who has written a book on Intervision.",
      "With his fulsome embrace of Russian nationalism in his music and performances, Shaman is viewed by the government as \u201ca new political symbol for new audiences,\u201d according to Yurtaeva-Martens, adding that it was unlikely they would have chosen anyone else because he \u201cwas the best choice for the Russian government.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Kenya\u2019s Sanaipei Tande is competing with her song \u201cFlavour,\u201d an Afropop tune that mixes English and Kiswahili.",
      "In between rehearsals in Moscow, she said in a Zoom interview this week that she hadn\u2019t heard of Intervision before this year and was only really familiar with Eurovision because 2011\u2019s contest had featured Norwegian-Kenyan singer Stella Mwangi.",
      "For artists who may have had success at home, performing at Intervision is a chance to step onto a larger stage, she said. In her case, this is both metaphorically and literally true because \u201cthe live arena is so huge.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never seen any stage in my country that\u2019s this big,\u201d she said, adding that coming to the Russian capital \u201cto compete against other international artists \u2014 that, for me, has put me on a whole new level.\u201d",
      "The fact she had been selected and was representing Kenya was a victory in itself, she said.",
      "\u201cI mean, $300,000 wouldn\u2019t be such a bad thing to add on to that,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cBut just being here and being able to perform on this stage and experiencing things on a whole new level, that already is a win.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "At the end of a recent appearance on TODAY, \u201cThe Paper\u201d stars Oscar Nu\u00f1ez, Gbemisola Ikumelo and Alex Edelman were asked to offer their best deadpan expression to the camera. Each actor stared into the camera, as if a mockumentary was being filmed right there in Studio 1A, pretending to show signs of sarcasm and disgust.",
      "That sense of humor that has served the trio so well in their new Peacock series, a successor of sorts to \u201cThe Office,\u201d carried over just minutes later when they settled into a dressing room at 30 Rock to chat with TODAY.com. When it\u2019s mentioned that \u201cThe Office\u201d is one of the most beloved comedies of all time, Edelman, with a straight face, replies, \u201cNever seen it. Not a fan.\u201d (Peacock is owned by TODAY.com\u2019s parent company, NBCUniversal.)",
      "Officially, Peacock has touted \u201cThe Paper\u201d as a comedy that is \u201cin the tradition of \u2018The Office.\u2019\u201d The two shows are connected in a variety of ways \u2014 for one, both were co-created by Greg Daniels. For another, both feature Nu\u00f1ez, who is reprising his role of Oscar Martinez as he moves on from the Dunder Mifflin paper company in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to the Toledo Truth Teller newspaper in Ohio. (Oscar does drop the occasional reference to his old life in \u201cThe Paper,\u201d including in a phone call to his puzzle-loving former co-worker, Stanley.)",
      "However, the cast has taken care to emphasize that \u201cThe Paper\u201d is not a remake or a spinoff of \u201cThe Office.\u201d In a May interview with Collider, Domhnall Gleeson, who plays Ned Sampson, the new editor-in-chief of the newspaper, said, \u201cThe people are going to have to take the show on its own merits because it\u2019s become something different. It\u2019s a whole new city. It\u2019s not like a remake.\u201d",
      "Nu\u00f1ez shares a similar perspective in the interview with TODAY.com, saying, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a spinoff. It was never presented as one. People want it to be. It\u2019s a different show. It is the same documentary crew visiting another place with new people, and so that part is brand new.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m the only glue, the sexy glue, that holds everything together,\u201d he quips.",
      "Edelman, who is a writer on the show in addition to his role as Adam, says that while \u201cThe Paper\u201d has the same \u201caesthetic\u201d of \u201cThe Office,\u201d with its camerawork and the return of directors who previously helmed episodes of the Emmy-winning NBC series, the \u201ccontent\u201d is what separates the two. He wasn\u2019t motivated to re-create the magic of \u201cThe Office,\u201d per se; he was motivated to make a good show with people he considers to be talented and funny.",
      "\u201cIf I\u2019m being honest, I\u2019m surprised by the questions now about the pressure that one would feel from \u2018The Office,\u2019 because, frankly, you just feel pressure from your really talented co-workers,\u201d he continues.",
      "Ikumelo, who co-stars as Adelola, sees the premise of the show \u2014 that of a failing newspaper \u2014 as something fresh and different.",
      "\u201cI just thought there was so much comedy that could be mined from that and also story, and it felt like a genuine, real, kicking-off point, rather than a, \u2018Oh, we need to create something from a show that\u2019s existed before.\u2019 It felt like, \u2018Oh, no, this is real meat and real story,\u2019 and something that feels like it\u2019s important in terms of what\u2019s happening today,\u201d she says.",
      "\u2018Instant Chemistry\u2019 on the Set",
      "While Gleeson is the on-screen boss of \u201cThe Paper\u201d and has numerous impressive credits to his name, ranging from \u201cHarry Potter\u201d to the Oscar-winning \u201cEx Machina\u201d to \u201cStar Wars,\u201d \u201cThe Paper\u201d is an ensemble comedy in the same way \u201cThe Office\u201d was. Nu\u00f1ez is the link between those two ensembles, but he\u2019s not so sure it was essential that he be included in the new show.",
      "\u201cI surely appreciated it,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s neat. I think it\u2019s cool. It\u2019s a little nod.\u201d",
      "Then, emphasizing the talent of a cast that also includes Sabrina Impacciatore, Chelsea Frei and Tim Key, he adds, \u201cIt\u2019s not really my show.\u201d",
      "Nu\u00f1ez and Edelman say the chemistry between the cast members is evident in the final product. Edelman saw from the beginning that the actors were jelling on the set.",
      "\u201cIt was really funny and good from the start, because Greg Daniels directed our pilot, so he knew what we wanted,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut I do think when you watch the show, you see the characters getting more and more comfortable with each other, which is really, really nice, because the narrative of the show is that this group is in sort of a new group.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt the end of the season, I was like, man, we really feel like a unit in a way that really makes sense for the narrative, which is really, really nice,\u201d he says.",
      "Ikumelo recalls being in the room as the show was being cast, saying decisions were made meticulously and with intention.",
      "\u201cThat casting, I think, helped in terms of the temperaments and the kinds of funny that people bring to the table. I think that really helps in terms of just generating instant chemistry, because it was cast well,\u201d she notes.",
      "Finding New Fans With \u2018The Paper\u2019",
      "The day before \u201cThe Paper\u201d premiered on Peacock on Sept. 4, the streaming platform announced the show had been renewed for a second season. The first season will also get a run on broadcast TV, when \u201cThe Paper\u201d joins NBC\u2019s Monday-night lineup beginning Nov. 10.",
      "Nu\u00f1ez is hoping as \u201cThe Paper\u201d continues to find an audience that it attracts both fans of \u201cThe Office\u201d and new fans as well.",
      "Edelman chimes in that the show is already being discovered by viewers who may be less familiar with \u201cThe Office.\u201d",
      "By some measures, \u201cThe Paper\u201d is already a hit with viewers and critics. It\u2019s currently one of the most-watched shows on Peacock, and it has an 84% Tomatometer rating on Rotten Tomatoes.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019ve made this really beautiful thing on its own terms that we\u2019re all really, really proud of,\u201d Edelman says. \u201cI think as you watch over the course of the season, it just gets funnier and funnier.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t wait to start shooting\u201d Season 2, Nu\u00f1ez responds."

      "The huge, unanswered questions: Why did she do it? How could a mother do that to her own daughter?",
      "Over two years, Kendra sent thousands of texts to her daughter and her daughter's then-boyfriend that were mean, vulgar, sexually explicit and even dangerous.",
      "In December 2022, Kendra Licari was charged with two counts of stalking a minor, two counts of communicating with another to commit a crime and one count of obstruction of justice, per an Isabella County arrest warrant obtained by TODAY.com.",

      "\u201cI can\u2019t imagine any parent saying such horrible things to her own daughter,\u201d he added.",

      "There's no official explanation \u2014 not in the documentary or any public record. If Kendra Licari has any sort of mental health diagnosis that could explain her behavior, it\u2019s not been made public. We may never know the answer. But people close to the case have theories.",
      "\u201cI think it was a cyber Munchausen\u2019s case,\u201d said Bill Chillman, Lauryn\u2019s school superintendent, in the documentary. \u201cShe wanted her daughter to need her in such a way that she was willing to hurt her and this is the way she chose to do that.\u201d",

      "Both had a lot to say about the documentary and the true story behind it.",
      "\"Unknown Number\": A Psychologist's Perspective",
      "Dr. Mary Sanders, a Stanford psychologist, tells TODAY.com that Munchausen by proxy is \"when someone falsifies illness on behalf of someone else, usually a parent on behalf of a child, and that behavior persists even though there is no external reward,\" she says. \"Basically, it's to meet their psychological needs.\"",
      "The presence of technology has added new opportunities for the disorder to present itself. Dr. Marc Feldman, a psychiatry professor at the University of Alabama and Munchausen expert, has noted the rise of \"Munchausen by internet.\"",
      "\"Even when your mom does the seemingly most evil things you could imagine, you still saw your mom laugh. You were still comforted when your mom hugged you. There was still this good mom that cared so much.\"",
      "Jordyn Hope, Munchausen by proxy survivor",
      "Neither Sanders nor Feldman have personally treated Kendra Licari; they spoke about the condition in general.",
      "\"Online is now another arena to get attention,\" Sanders says.",
      "Sanders says parents with the syndrome use defense mechanisms, rationalization and compartmentalization to inflict harmful behaviors on their child. Sometimes these parents have been lured by Make-a-Wish trips to Disneyland. Other times they simply get a rush from the excitement and admiration they get as the parent of a \"sick\" kid. Few understand the harm they cause.",
      "\"They crave being able to rush in and and be a hero or receive a lot of attention for caretaking,\" says Sanders.",
      "\"Certainly this is abusive, extremely emotionally abusive,\" Sanders says of Kendra's behavior after watching the documentary. \"You know, some might even say sexually abusive as well, and certainly intentional deception.\"",
      "She adds, \"It's so disturbing how much there was about the texts  encouraging her to kill herself.\"",
      "Sanders notes that Kendra claimed to have known that Lauryn wouldn't kill herself, \"but we certainly know of cases in which kids have with far less cyberbullying than this.\" (Sanders says she worked with a parent who spoke similarly to their child, who survived, but did did end up inflicting self-harm.)",
      "At the same time, Sanders says she wants viewers to understand that \"people are complex.\" She says, \"People like Kendra are more than the worst behavior they ever did.\"",
      "Together with UCLA psychologist Dr. Brenda Bursch, Sanders developed the ACCEPTS model for treatment and management of Munchausen by proxy. The acronym stands for ACknowledgement, Coping, Empathy, Parenting, Taking charge and Support.",
      "In the documentary, Kendra says that \"everybody\" breaks the law at some point. This leads Sanders to believe that even after serving time in jail, Kendra has still not truly acknowledged the gravity of her actions.",
      "\"Acknowledgement is first,\" Sanders says. \"So if we don't even get there, the rest don't even matter.\"",
      "\u201cUnknown Number\u201d: A Survivor's Perspective",
      "At the age of 22, Jordyn Hope (who uses they/them pronouns) realized while learning about Munchausen by proxy in college that they were actually a survivor of the disorder.",
      "Jordyn's mother, Donna, took Jordyn to the hospital as a child for reported seizures, iron deficiency, asthma, fevers, anorexia, neutropenia and other conditions.",
      "Now 30, Jordyn has spent years unraveling their childhood of abuse, digging through medical records, confronting pediatricians and even appearing on a televised episode of \"The Doctors\" with their mother.",
      "\"If I get triggered, I don't know if I need to go to the ER or just take a Tylenol,\" says Jordyn, who now works as an independent contractor for Munchausen Support. \"It's definitely a journey.\"",
      "As Jordyn watched \"Unknown Number,\" they say they remember thinking, \"Whoa. I relate to this.\" Seeing Lauryn\u2019s face freeze while learning that her mother was the source of the cyberbullying has haunted Jordyn.",
      "\"One of the big things that really, really struck me was this sense of identity and having believed this whole time that it's you and Mom against the world, that it's you and Mom that are best friends, that Mom is helping you through this really, really hard, scary thing ... and then to find out Mom was actually doing these things to you,\" Jordyn says.",
      "Like Kendra, Donna was present at many of Jordyn's activities, coaching gymnastics and cheerleading \u2014 even winning the \"Best Mom\" title at Jordyn's beauty pageant. Donna died last year, leading to a complicated grieving process for Jordyn, who still occasionally texted and called their mom until the end.",
      "Jordyn completely understands why Lauryn still loves her mom and wants to communicate with her.",
      "\"Even when your mom does the seemingly most evil things you could imagine, you still saw your mom laugh. You were still comforted when your mom hugged you. There was still this good mom that cared so much,\" Jordyn shares, their voice wavering.",
      "\"I imagine most people watch that documentary and think, how could Lauryn still love her mom?\" Jordyn says. \"I just want to tell her that anything she's thinking or feeling is OK. She didn't do anything wrong. When you're a victim to something like this, there's nothing that you could have done wrong.\""

      "\u201cI think that what we are demonstrating is to live unapologetically, live in the truth that we are authentically and to not let other people step into that space and dictate with their opinions against the love that you truly have because like my wife said, love does conquer all,\u201d Verrett adds.",

      "In an interview with Vanity Fair, Verrett defined \u201cshaman\u201d as a \u201cperson who\u2019s here to bridge back the spiritual world and the physical world in a tangible way that makes sense in the here and now. And also to give you tools so that you can be able to explore yourself, see yourself, know yourself, love yourself, and be who you truly came here to be.\u201d",
      "Verrett is also the host of the podcast \u201cAncient Wisdom Today\u201d and author of \"Spirit Hacking: Shamanic Keys to Reclaim Your Personal Power, Transform Yourself, and Light Up the World.\u201d",

      "\u201cI\u2019ve met you before,\u201d M\u00e4rtha Louise recalled herself saying in a joint Vanity Fair interview with Verrett. \u201cI know you already.\u201d",

      "M\u00e4rtha Louise, who once managed an alternative therapy center that taught clairvoyance and how to speak to angels, per Reuters, quickly became friends with Verrett.",

      "\u201cI love Durek\u2019s wisdom and humor and his depth, and that we can talk about any topic under the sun and that he always sees me, and always wants to evolve. I love that about you,\u201d M\u00e4rtha Louise said, adding that he\u2019s also \u201cvery handsome as well.\u201d",
      "As for Verrett, he noted that he loves M\u00e4rtha Louise\u2019s \u201cbeautiful\u201d soul.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s such a pure heart. She loves her children, she loves her family, she loves people,\u201d he said. \u201cI love how she is willing to be open to new ideas. Really being able to nurture the people around her is so beautiful.\u201d",
      "Why have they faced controversy?",
      "M\u00e4rtha Louise and Verrett have faced criticism through the years for their alternative beliefs and their relationship.",
      "Some of Verrett\u2019s beliefs have come under fire. For example, in his 2019 book, he made the claim that childhood cancer is caused by unhappiness. Following scandal, the Norwegian publisher attached to the project declined to publish it in Norway.",
      "In a post on Facebook, mayor of Oslo criticized Verrett for selling a $222 \u201cspirit optimizer\u201d on his website, which Verrett says can do things like \u201cenergize your food and drinks so they assimilate into your body more easily\u201d and \u201charmonize your space.\u201d",
      "In a joint interview with Vanity Fair, the couple said they receive hate online.",
      "\u201cEvery day I wake up, there\u2019s tons of mail from Norway of what a horrible person I am. And I\u2019m just like, what have I ever done to any of you?\u201d Verrett said.",
      "\u201cPeople are very angry,\u201d M\u00e4rtha Louise added. \u201cThey think that he has put a spell on me, that he\u2019s an awful person. There\u2019s people writing like, \u2018I don\u2019t trust his eyes. Look at his evil eyes.\u2019 They write that a lot. \u2018It\u2019s shameful. It\u2019s terrible. You should never be a part of the royal family being with a Shaman. What is that? Everything he does is just phony and it\u2019s false. How don\u2019t you see through that? It\u2019s terrible. You\u2019re a disgrace.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd of course, with him being Black and I\u2019m being white, you get all that kind of hate as well,\u201d she continued.",
      "Speaking to Vanity Fair, M\u00e4rtha Louise said the relationship opened her eyes to racism in Norway. \u201cBefore I met him, I never thought that there was racism in Norway, because we\u2019re all an open, happy family. But basically, there are not that many people of color in Norway, so it was all a surprise to me,\u201d she said.",
      "The Royal House of Norway condemned racist backlash in a statement in its website, saying, \u201cWe deplore the racist attitudes that Durek Verrett has had to contend with, especially on social media. We consider it a strength that the Royal House reflects Norway\u2019s ethnic diversity.\u201d",
      "M\u00e4rtha Louise also provided a statement on the Royal House of Norway\u2019s website clarifying her beliefs in alternative medicine, saying she is \u201cgrateful\u201d for the country\u2019s health care system, but also thinks \u201cfor many people alternative methods can be an important supplement to help from the conventional medical establishment.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am aware that many people follow what I do and say very closely. My title entails a certain responsibility. It is therefore important to me, including in my business activity, to distinguish between myself as a private person on the one hand and as a member of the Royal Family on the other. Sometimes I stumble, and am grateful to receive supportive advice along the way,\u201d she wrote.",
      "What is the couple\u2019s status as royals?",
      "In November 2022, following controversy around their engagement, M\u00e4rtha Louise said she would no longer officially represent the Norwegian royal house, but would still retain her title.",
      "\u201cThe process with the family has been amicable and loving,\u201d the caption read. As part of her message, she also wrote, \u201cDurek has a right to his autonomy and to speak his mind like everyone else.\u201d",
      "In the same video, Verrett addressed controversy his beliefs stirred.",
      "\u201cI know that some of the things I have said and done have been seen as controversial in Norway. Some have said this has become a problem in Norway. I want to be clear this was never my intention. I wish Martha\u2019s family well and want to do my part to support them in their roles,\u201d he said, but maintained he has a \u201cright to autonomy.\u201d",
      "The Royal House of Norway, in a statement, explained the decision. \u201cThe objective is both to prevent misunderstandings regarding the Royal House and to allow the Princess and Durek Verrett greater freedom in their business activities and other parts of their lives,\u201d a statement read.",
      "The Royal House of Norway shared details about Verrett\u2019s specific role in the monarchy.",
      "\u201cWhen Durek Verrett and Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise are married, Mr Verrett will become a part of the Royal Family, the website said, as M\u00e4rtha Louise\u2019s last husband Ari Behn was. \u201cBut in accordance with tradition he will not have a title or represent the Royal House of Norway.\u201d"

    "published": "Sat, 20 Sep 2025 08:30:00 GMT",
    "summary": "After it was barred from the Eurovision Song Contest Russia is reviving a Soviet-era version of the camp competition.",
    "story": [
      "Perhaps the Eurovision ban is starting to bite, because three years after Russia was booted from the beloved song contest following the country\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, it is reviving a Soviet-era version of the camp competition.",
      "The Intervision Song Contest will see 23 artists from around the world \u2014 including one representing the U.S. \u2014 offer a heady mix of musical styles, from moody Belarusian pop to Colombian folk and high-energy Vietnamese rap at an arena in the capital of Moscow on Saturday night.",
      "Unlike the Eurovision Song Contest, which mainly includes European countries and a few others like Australia and Israel, Intervision bills itself as a truly global event by offering artists from countries around the world, including those in the Global South, a chance to compete for the top prize of 30 million rubles (roughly $360,000).",
      "\u201cBack in the Soviet times, the government would decide to promote a positive image of Russia abroad. We need to promote an objective image. We want to be known with all our merits and shortcomings,\u201d Russia\u2019s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told a news conference this week in response to a presubmitted question from NBC News.",
      "Asked whether Russia was using the competition as an exercise in soft power, he replied, \u201cIf by soft power you mean the opportunity to let people know about us, then of course we\u2019re interested in this.\u201d",
      "A pop phenomenon drawing around 160 million viewers each May, Eurovision began at the height of the Cold War in 1956 as a technical experiment to try and broadcast a simultaneous program across the member stations of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).",
      "A divided continent had mirror organizations like the NATO defense alliance in Western Europe and the Warsaw Pact in Eastern Europe, and the EBU in the West matched by the International Radio and Television Organisation (OIRT) on the other side of the Iron Curtain.",
      "In answer to Eurovision came Intervision, which was broadcast by the OIRT on several occasions between 1965 and 1980, with contests held in what was then Czechoslovakia and later in Poland.",
      "But Dean Vuletic, who has written and edited books on Eurovision and led a research project on Intervision, says Russia is getting its history wrong with the relaunch, \u201cpresenting Intervision as something that was Russian- or Soviet-led, but it actually wasn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Instead, he said, the competitions \u201cweren\u2019t that focused on the Soviet participants,\u201d although they had to be invited. Having studied the archives of Czech and Polish TV stations, he said it was \u201castonishing how critical they are of the Soviet participants.\u201d",
      "He added that it was actually created during a period of liberalization in an attempt \u201cto promote East-West cooperation in popular music and television,\u201d and Western performers like Gloria Gaynor were invited to perform in the intervals. Performers from Eastern Europe were also hoping to be signed by Western labels, he added.",
      "Before it was kicked out in 2022 after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia was frequently a top-10 finalist at Eurovision, which Vuletic called \u201ca huge platform for cultural diplomacy for any country,\u201d big or small.",
      "The country\u2019s leaders \u201csaw it as a very prestigious cultural project and one which could reach a huge amount of people,\u201d he added.",
      "But Eurovision\u2019s embrace of LGBTQ rights drew the ire of conservative Russian lawmakers and the country\u2019s Orthodox Church, particularly after the 2014 victory of bearded drag queen Conchita Wurst.",
      "Saturday\u2019s Intervision contest is getting a full-court press promotion from organizers, who have drafted a series of celebrity \u201cambassadors\u201d to get the word out. Among them are Dima Bilan, a Russian singer who won Eurovision in 2008, and Alexander Ovechkin, the Washington Capitals hockey star, who holds the record for most goals scored in NHL history.",
      "The goal is to \u201cpromote universal, spiritual, family, cultural, ethical, and religious traditions of different nations,\u201d according to the competition\u2019s website, although that seems potentially at odds with the entrant representing the U.S., Vassy, who has a history of performing at Pride events and supporting LGBTQ rights.",
      "Vassy, an Australian-born singer living in Los Angeles, has been a vocalist on dance tracks from David Guetta and Ti\u00ebsto, while several of her own topped Billboard\u2019s Dance Club Songs chart in the 2010s.",
      "The 42-year-old, whose real name is Vasiliki Karagiorgos, was a last-minute addition to the contest after the previous selection pulled out due to \u201cunforeseen family circumstances.\u201d",
      "Her outlook is markedly different from that of Russia\u2019s entrant, Shaman, who mixes politics and pop and rose in popularity after he became a strident supporter of the war in Ukraine.",
      "So vocal is his backing of the Kremlin that he has ended up on Australian and European Union sanction lists.",
      "Russia will be hoping that Shaman\u2019s popularity can bring a younger audience to the contest as well as his fans, many of whom are based outside major Russian metropolises like Moscow and St. Petersburg, according to Yulia Yurtaeva-Martens, a researcher at the Free University of Berlin who has written a book on Intervision.",
      "With his fulsome embrace of Russian nationalism in his music and performances, Shaman is viewed by the government as \u201ca new political symbol for new audiences,\u201d according to Yurtaeva-Martens, adding that it was unlikely they would have chosen anyone else because he \u201cwas the best choice for the Russian government.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Kenya\u2019s Sanaipei Tande is competing with her song \u201cFlavour,\u201d an Afropop tune that mixes English and Kiswahili.",
      "In between rehearsals in Moscow, she said in a Zoom interview this week that she hadn\u2019t heard of Intervision before this year and was only really familiar with Eurovision because 2011\u2019s contest had featured Norwegian-Kenyan singer Stella Mwangi.",
      "For artists who may have had success at home, performing at Intervision is a chance to step onto a larger stage, she said. In her case, this is both metaphorically and literally true because \u201cthe live arena is so huge.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never seen any stage in my country that\u2019s this big,\u201d she said, adding that coming to the Russian capital \u201cto compete against other international artists \u2014 that, for me, has put me on a whole new level.\u201d",
      "The fact she had been selected and was representing Kenya was a victory in itself, she said.",
      "\u201cI mean, $300,000 wouldn\u2019t be such a bad thing to add on to that,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cBut just being here and being able to perform on this stage and experiencing things on a whole new level, that already is a win.\u201d"

      "President Donald Trump has said he hopes to see Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan returned to U.S. control, suggesting a renewed American presence in the country now again ruled by the Taliban.",
      "\"We're trying to get it back,\" Trump said of Bagram during a news conference Thursday alongside British Prime Minister Keir Starmer that capped a whirlwind state visit to the United Kingdom.",
      "Taking aim at the Biden administration's fraught withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan as a \"total disaster,\" Trump criticized the decision to relinquish Bagram Airfield, which quickly fell under the control of the Taliban as they swept back into power in 2021.",
      "\"We gave it to them for nothing,\" said Trump, who has long criticized the Biden administration's handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan. \"We want that base back,\" he said.",
      "About an hour's drive north of Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, Bagram served for years as a crucial hub in the war against the Taliban and Al Qaeda. At its peak around 2012, the sprawling airfield saw more than 100,000 U.S. troops pass through its compound.",
      "Late Thursday, Zakir Jalaly, an official at the Afghan Foreign Ministry, dismissed the idea of Bagram returning to the U.S.",
      "\u201cAfghanistan and the U.S. need to interact with each other and can have economic and political relations based on mutual respect and common interests,\u201d Jalaly said on the social platform X. \u201cThe Afghans have not accepted a military presence in history, and this possibility was completely rejected during the Doha talks and agreement, but the door is open for further interaction.\u201d",
      "Trump made clear at least one motivating factor for his interest in reclaiming Bagram, noting its proximity to rival superpower China.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons,\u201d Trump said during his comments Thursday, which came a day before he was spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping amid ongoing trade negotiations.",
      "Addressing journalists later on Air Force One, Trump said Bagram was \"one of the most powerful bases in the world in terms of runway strength and length,\" adding: \"You could land anything there.\" He emphasized again that the base was \"an hour away from where they make their missiles \u2014 China.\"",
      "Addressing Trump's comments Friday, Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said that China \"respects Afghanistan\u2019s independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.",
      "\"Afghanistan\u2019s future should be decided by its own people,\" Lin said, adding: \"Stirring up tension and creating confrontation in the region won\u2019t be popular.\"",
      "China, which has made strides in rapidly expanding its nuclear stockpile, is estimated to have accumulated about 600 warheads, according to the Chicago-based nonprofit Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.",
      "Of course, greater surveillance on China wouldn't be the only advantage to regaining Bagram.",
      "A presence at the base could also aid in regional counterterrorism efforts, among other factors that could appeal to Trump.",
      "It remains unclear to what extent, if any, the U.S. has been in talks with the Taliban on the future of Bagram.",
      "\u201cEven if the Taliban considered this, China most certainly would do everything it can to entice the Taliban to keep the U.S. out of Afghanistan and has far more leverage and enticements to make this happen,\" Bill Roggio, editor of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies\u2019 Long War Journal, cautioned in comments shared online Thursday.",
      "\"The Trump administration should be very careful not to grant the Taliban concessions only to be prevented access to Bagram in the end,\" he said.",
      "The Taliban have been working to rehabilitate their global standing, with the militant group freeing American George Glezmann, a Delta Air Lines mechanic, in March amid efforts to normalize relations between Afghanistan and the U.S.",
      "On Friday, the Taliban also released British couple Barbie Reynolds, 76, and her husband, Peter Reynolds, 80, who were detained by the Interior Ministry in February, according to Sky News, NBC News' sister outlet in the United Kingdom.",
      "Trump's comments came as the Pentagon continues to push ahead with a review into the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, during which 13 U.S. service members and 170 Afghans were killed at Kabul's airport in a bombing by the Islamic State terrorist group.",
      "Trump, who began the process for the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan during his first term, has been a fierce critic of the Biden administration's handling of the drawdown.",
      "The White House under President Joe Biden largely blamed the Trump administration for the chaotic withdrawal, with a National Security Council report released in 2023 arguing that Biden's options for executing the operation were \"severely constrained by conditions created by his predecessor.\""

      "The words of Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk \u2014 the first president of an independent Czechoslovakia, which has since split into Czechia and Slovakia \u2014 were unveiled in a live broadcast attended by current Czech President Petr Pavel.",
      "Speculation had gone into overdrive prior to the announcement, with experts wondering whether Masaryk may have conveyed a fateful warning before Europe's descent back into war. His words are believed to have been dictated to his son Jan, surviving both World War II and subsequent communist rule.",
      "Jan\u2019s former secretary handed the envelope to the National Archives in 2005 on the condition that it not be opened for another 20 years.",
      "Even the Masaryk family did not know what mystery the white envelope contained. But when it was opened early Friday, it still managed to surprise.",
      "Inside was another yellow envelope, containing five pages of handwritten notes in Czech and English (Masaryk's wife, Charlotte Garrigue, was born in the United States.)",
      "Rather than a final message before his death in 1937, experts assessed that the message was instead dictated three years earlier.",
      "\u201cI am ill, seriously ill \u2014 it is the end, but I am not afraid. You will continue the work, you know how, but you must be careful. You know how to behave; I don\u2019t need to tell you anything more,\u201d the letter read, according to the country's official broadcaster.",
      "At the time, Masaryk was gravely ill after a stroke, and those around him thought his days were numbered.",
      "Masaryk became the first president of Czechoslovakia in 1918 after it declared independence from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which was defeated in World War I. He served until 1935. Jan became foreign minister at the end of World War II, until his sudden death in 1948.",
      "In the envelope, Masaryk talked extensively about his death and subsequent funeral and reflected on the complex political situation in the ethnically diverse country.",
      "As well as derisive comments about a Slovak politician, he urged keeping the German minority part of the state. \u201cGive them what they deserve, but no more,\u201d he said of the Germans, according to the state broadcaster.",
      "\u201c[This was a] crucial time in Czechoslovakia with Hitler just coming to power in Germany,\u201d said Mark Cornwall, an emeritus professor of modern European history at the University of Southampton in England.",
      "\u201cIt was a very turbulent period in Europe about what was going to happen,\u201d said Cornwall, nodding to the Nazis' subsequent annexation of the Sudetenland, a Czech region that had a significant German-speaking population, and the later outbreak of World War II.",
      "\u201cMasaryk is still very revered\u201d in the country, Cornwall told NBC News in a telephone interview. \u201cI can\u2019t think of an American equivalent. Perhaps he\u2019s George Washington or Abraham Lincoln.\u201d"

      "A series of unprecedented Russian incursions into NATO members' airspace in recent weeks has raised the alarm across Europe, which is looking towards an emboldened Kremlin for clues to its intentions and next moves.",
      "The incidents have also exposed a contrast between European leaders' urgent calls for action and President Donald Trump's more muted response, as he continues to hold back on imposing additional sanctions on Moscow as its war on Ukraine rages on.",
      "On Friday, for the second time in 10 days, a NATO ally invoked Article 4 following airspace violations linked to Russia \u2014 a mechanism that prompts urgent talks among allies and that had only been triggered seven times in its 76-year history before this month.",
      "Earlier in the day, three MiG-31 fighter aircraft entered Estonian airspace without permission and remained there for a total of 12 minutes, according to the country's Ministry of Defense. NATO aircraft intercepted the jets, the military alliance\u2019s spokesperson Allison Hart said.",
      "Estonia's Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna called the incursion \"unprecedentedly brazen,\" saying Russia had already violated its airspace four times this year.",
      "It was \u201can extremely dangerous provocation,\u201d added Kaja Kallas, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief.",
      "Russia denied violating Estonian airspace, saying aircraft were making a scheduled flight from from Russia to Kaliningrad, an exclave wedged between Poland and Lithuania, that was conducted in \u201cstrict compliance\u201d with international regulations.",
      "While European leaders have responded with urgency, signaling deep concern and pushing for stronger measures on Moscow amid Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, President Donald Trump has struck a more restrained note as he continues to hold back on imposing further sanctions on the Kremlin.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t love it,\u201d Trump said Friday on the latest incursion. \u201cI don\u2019t like when that happens. Could be big trouble.\u201d",
      "Although Trump has expressed frustration and disappointment with Putin, saying on Thursday that the Russian leader \u201chas let me down,\u201d relations with the Kremlin have warmed dramatically during this administration.",
      "Trump has also been unwilling to impose further sanctions on Russia over the invasion of Ukraine, despite repeated threats.",
      "The President said last week he was \"ready to do major sanctions on Russia,\" once NATO nations had \"agreed, and started, to do the same thing,\" and criticized allies for continuing to purchase Russian oil.",
      "Estonia and the United States are members of NATO, which at its core is a mutual defense pact formed after World War II to counter the threat posed by the Soviet Union, meaning an attack on one may be considered an attack on all.",
      "Friday's incident marked the third incursion into NATO airspace linked to Russia in ten days.",
      "On Sept. 10, Poland reported Russian drones entering its territory, triggering the first Article 4 request this month. Four days later, Romania scrambled jets to respond to a Russian drone breach. Romania did not invoke Article 4.",
      "Moscow downplayed the incident, saying it had \u201cno plans to target\u201d facilities in Poland, but Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said it was \u201cthe closest we have been to open conflict since World War II.\u201d",
      "Trump, again, offered a more muted response, saying the suspected incursion \"could have been a mistake.\"",
      "His acting U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Dorothy Shea, sought to reassure allies. Violating the airspace of a U.S. ally, \u201cintentionally or otherwise,\u201d showed \u201cimmense disrespect for good-faith U.S. efforts to bring an end to this conflict,\u201d she told the U.N. Security Council.",
      "\"Rest assured, we will defend every inch of NATO territory,\" she added.",
      "Moscow has not commented on the Romanian claims.",
      "Brett Erickson, a sanctions expert and adviser to Loyola University\u2019s Chicago School of Law, warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin was testing the West\u2019s resolve, and battlefield readiness.",
      "\u201cIf the West hesitates, Russia will keep testing, probing, and collecting data on our response,\u201d he told NBC News via email. \u201cEvery incursion is a rehearsal. Unless we act decisively now, we are training Moscow to believe NATO is predictable, divided, and slow.\u201d",
      "The divergence between Europe's urgent stance and Trump's restraint comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pressed Washington for stronger measures, who has urged Trump to take a clearer position on Moscow.",
      "\"If the war continues and there are no movements towards peace, we expect sanctions,\" he told reporters Friday evening, adding that he expects Trump to take such actions.",
      "Russian air strikes killed at least three people and wounded dozens more as it launched a large-scale missile and drone attack across multiple Ukrainian regions on Friday night.",
      "Loyala's Erickson said sanctions were essential, and must be \u201call-out\u201d and \u201call-together,\u201d urging Washington to align with its allies.",

      "Trump summarized their conversation, which he said began at 8 a.m. ET, in a Truth Social post in which he said he appreciates \u201cthe TikTok approval,\u201d but stopped short of announcing any kind of finalized deal. As expected, the call also appeared to touch on the ongoing trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies.",
      "\u201cI just completed a very productive call with President Xi of China. We made progress on many very important issues including Trade, Fentanyl, the need to bring the War between Russia and Ukraine to an end, and the approval of the TikTok Deal,\u201d Trump wrote.",

      "Trump said that he agreed with Xi that they would meet at the Oct. 31-Nov. 1 APEC summit in South Korea, that Trump would go to China early next year, and that Xi would eventually come to the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe call was a very good one, we will be speaking again by phone, appreciate the TikTok approval, and both look forward to meeting at APEC!\u201d the president wrote.",
      "The White House is not disputing the characterization that there is no final TikTok deal. An announcement on a final deal would ultimately come from the president, a White House official said.",
      "Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office Friday afternoon, Trump offered some mixed messages on the status of TikTok talks. He said Xi \"approved the TikTok deal,\" and then said \"we look forward to getting that deal closed.\"",
      "Asked directly if the deal was fully approved, Trump said, \"Well, I think so. I mean \u2014 when you say fully approved, I don\u2019t know what that means. We have to get, we have to get it signed. I guess it could be a formality.\"",
      "He added that \"the TikTok deal is well on its way.\"",
      "Separately, Chinese state media said Trump and Xi had a \u201ccandid and in-depth exchange of views\u201d and that the call was \u201cpragmatic, positive, and constructive.\u201d Xi said the U.S. should avoid taking restrictive trade measures \u201cto prevent undermining the outcomes achieved through multiple rounds of consultations,\u201d according to a readout published by Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency.",
      "On TikTok, Xi said the Chinese government \u201crespects the will of companies and is pleased to see companies conduct business negotiations on the basis of market rules and reach solutions that comply with Chinese laws and regulations and balance interests,\u201d the readout said.",
      "\u201cWe hope the U.S. side will provide an open, fair, and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies investing in the United States,\u201d it said.",

      "Friday's call was the first between Trump and Xi since June, when Trump said they had spoken for about 90 minutes in a discussion focused on trade.",
      "At the height of trade tensions in April, U.S. and Chinese tariff rates reached as high as 145%, in what amounted to a mutual trade embargo. Since then they have been lowered under another \u201cframework\u201d deal, with new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods capped at 30%, while China imposes a 10% additional tariff on U.S. goods.",
      "The lower tariff rates are set to expire on Nov. 10 unless a deal is reached or the trade truce is extended again.",
      "The two countries also continue to tussle over export controls on strategically important products such as rare earths, which China has a near-monopoly over, and U.S. chip technology.",
      "TikTok, which is estimated to have about 170 million active users in the U.S., faces a ban unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, agrees to sell the app\u2019s U.S. assets to U.S. owners. The sale is required under a law Congress passed last year, citing national security concerns.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump formally extended the deadline for a TikTok deal for a fourth time, until Dec. 16, a day after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Beijing and Washington had struck a \u201cframework\u201d for an agreement, without providing details such as who would be taking over TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations.",
      "Trump has gone back and forth on the ban, but he credits TikTok with helping him win last year\u2019s presidential election and has expressed concern about alienating its huge and youthful user base. He said Thursday during a visit to the U.K. that the app \u201chas tremendous value\u201d and that \u201cvery rich people and companies are going to be owning it.\u201d",
      "U.S. officials have said the TikTok sale is necessary because of Chinese laws that require Chinese companies to share data requested by the government. They also cite concerns about data collection and the algorithm the app uses to recommend content to users, which they say is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese officials.",
      "TikTok denies sharing user data with Chinese authorities and says the U.S. has never provided evidence of Beijing trying to manipulate the algorithm.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance say the powerful algorithm, which has helped fuel the app\u2019s global success, is proprietary and thus difficult to sell to a U.S. company under Chinese law.",
      "There are concerns that TikTok may continue to use the Chinese algorithm in the U.S.",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich., chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., the committee\u2019s ranking member, have both expressed opposition to any deal that keeps the algorithm under Chinese control or allows ByteDance to maintain an operational relationship with the new American TikTok.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has all the leverage he needs to strike a deal that saves TikTok and complies with the law \u2014 which means making sure TikTok\u2019s data and algorithm are truly in American hands,\u201d Krishnamoorthi said in a statement Thursday.",
      "Any deal would most likely need to be approved by Congress as well as ByteDance\u2019s board.",
      "Compared with five years ago, when Trump first called for a ban during his first term, TikTok is more mature as a platform and less likely to keep growing, said Dimitar Gueorguiev, an associate professor of political science and director of Chinese studies at Syracuse University.",
      "\u201cTikTok is, I think, a less valuable bargaining chip from the Chinese perspective, and an easier concession,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, for the United States, it\u2019s as visible and kind of politically salient as ever.\u201d",
      "While the details of the TikTok deal remain unclear, Gueorguiev said, the broader question is \u201ccan the Trump administration, as well as their counterparts in Beijing, convert on whatever progress we observe today and keep it going\u201d to achieve a \u201clarger bargain\u201d between the U.S. and China.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re thinking about what is the ultimate outcome of this, and who wins and who loses, there\u2019s still a lot to be told,\u201d he said."

The specialist then contacted a silver shop owner, who sold the bracelet to the owner of a gold workshop in Cairo's gold and jewlery district for 180,000 Egyptian pounds ($3,700).",
      "The gold workshop owner, in turn, sold it to a worker at a gold foundry for 194,000 Egyptian pounds ($4,000), who melted it down and reshaped it into other jewelry.",
      "The ministry said security forces have arrested the three suspects and the proceeeds from the sale have been seized.",
      "The bracelet was among a collection of artifacts being prepared to be transported to Italy ahead of an exhibition titled \"Treasures of the Pharaohs\" at a museum in Rome starting next month.",
      "A specialized committee had been formed to inventory and review all artifacts kept in the museum\u2019s restoration laboratory to ensure no other artifacts had gone missing.",
      "Amenemope was a pharoah of the 21st dynasty who ruled Egypt from 993 to 984 B.C., according to the Egyptian Museum. His burial was notable for being one of three entirely intact royal burials known from ancient Egypt.",
      "His tomb was discovered by French Egyptologists Pierre Montet and Georges Goyon in April 1940, but its excavation was delayed by World War II, the museum says on its website.",
      "Egypt is no stranger to high-profile art and antiquities thefts.",
      "Vincent van Gogh\u2019s painting Poppy Flowers, valued at around $55 million, was stolen from Cairo\u2019s Mohamed Mahmoud Khalil Museum in 1977, recovered two years later, then stolen again in 2010. It has not yet been recovered."

      "Scientists have unearthed in Mongolia the oldest and most complete fossil of a pachycephalosaur, a group of dinosaurs known for their dome-shaped skulls, according to a new study published Wednesday in the journal Nature.",
      "The fossil, which dates to 108 to 115 million years ago, is that of a juvenile from a previously unknown species that researchers are calling Zavacephale rinpoche.",
      "It was discovered in the Khuren Dukh formation in the Gobi Desert in Mongolia, a landlocked country between China and Russia, by a team led by paleontologist Tsogtbaatar Chinzorig of the Mongolian Academy of Sciences.",
      "Very little is known about pachycephalosaurs, two-legged herbivores that lived in Asia and North America during the Cretaceous period and are among the \u201cmost enigmatic\u201d dinosaurs, the study said. They have become an object of growing popular fascination thanks to their distinctive, bony skulls, as well as appearances in media such as the \u201cJurassic Park\u201d films.",
      "Previously discovered pachycephalosaur fossils were limited mostly to skulls.",
      "\u201cYou could fit all of the pachycephalosaurs [fossils] in the world within a bathtub, more or less, or maybe two bathtubs \u2014 there are very few fossil pachycephalosaurs,\u201d Michael Pittman, a paleobiologist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, told NBC News.",
      "The study said the Mongolia discovery is the \u201cmost skeletally complete,\u201d providing researchers with far more detail about the anatomy of pachycephalosaurs than they had before.",
      "Researchers said the Zavacephale individual they found was at least 2 years old and about 3 feet long. Its skeleton, more than half of which has been found, features long legs, short arms and small hands, as well as stones known as gastroliths that the animal would have swallowed to help grind down the vegetation it ate.",
      "Though the animal was not fully grown, its skeleton already had the pachycephalosaur\u2019s signature thickened bone on top of the skull.",
      "The completeness of the fossil \u201cmakes it an important specimen for understanding how the cranial dome of pachycephalosaur developed,\u201d Chinzorig told the National History Museum in London.",
      "The purpose of the dome remains unclear, though scientists have suggested pachycephalosaurs may have used them to butt heads in combat or to impress potential mates.",
      "The fossil is also about 15 million years older than previously discovered pachycephalosaur specimens, helping to shed light on how the dinosaurs evolved.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the oldest pachycephalosaur, so it\u2019s giving us information of what earlier species were like and how they changed through time,\u201d Pittman said. \u201cSo finding an earlier one that still has it shows that actually they\u2019ve had that dome for a long time.\u201d",
      "Zavacephale was smaller than later pachycephalosaurs, which could grow to about 14 feet long."

    "story": [
      "Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said Wednesday that the destruction in the Gaza Strip could be turned into a lucrative real estate opportunity, echoing past remarks by President Donald Trump that outraged Palestinians and their supporters and raised questions about international law.",
      "Speaking at a real estate conference in Tel Aviv focused on the theme of urban renewal, Smotrich \u2014 a far-right minister in an Israeli government known for its right-wing political positions \u2014 said serious discussions were underway to rebuild Gaza as a business enterprise with American help.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a business plan \u2014 listen to me carefully \u2014 there\u2019s a business plan set by the most professional people there is and is on President Trump\u2019s table and how this thing turns into a real estate bonanza. I\u2019m not kidding; it pays off,\u201d he said, according to The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cI have started negotiations with the Americans \u2014 I say this not jokingly now \u2014 because I also demand, we paid a lot of money for this war, so we need to divide how we make a percentage on the land marketing later in Gaza. And now, no kidding, we\u2019ve done the demolition phase, which is always the first phase of urban renewal. Now we need to build; it\u2019s much cheaper.\u201d",
      "Any plans to take over the land or property left behind by displaced Palestinians would be a violation of international law, experts say.",
      "\u201cThis plan is tied to the plan to dispel or expel the civilian population, the so-called voluntary emigration plan, and then afterwards to assume permanent control over Gaza. And this is illegal,\u201d said Adil Haque, a law professor and expert on the law of armed conflict at Rutgers University.",
      "Smotrich\u2019s comments mirror remarks this year in which Trump described a possible U.S. takeover of Gaza to turn it into a \u201cRiviera of the Middle East.\u201d Trump did not flesh out details of that takeover plan, and there was no official reaction from the administration to the plan Smotrich described Wednesday.",
      "But a White House official told NBC News that Trump has been supportive of reconstruction plans for Gaza, which is home to about 2 million people.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has long promoted solutions that would help the people of Gaza rebuild,\u201d the official said. \u201cHowever, Hamas must first agree to disarm and give up rule in Gaza.\u201d",
      "Israeli bombs battered Gaza City on the second day of a devastating incursion into a dense urban environment that has sent thousands of Palestinians streaming south in hope of finding safer ground. A spokesperson for the Health Ministry in Gaza said more than 100 people were killed Wednesday, 80 of them in Gaza City alone.",
      "If Smotrich\u2019s real estate plan gains support among other officials within the Israeli government, the civilians escaping the Gaza City offensive may not have homes to go back to.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s appalling that any state would seek to profit from the suffering and dispossession of a civilian population,\u201d said Haque, the Rutgers law professor. \u201cKilling, injuring, displacing ordinary people is one of the most serious actions that any state can take, and they should only do so when it\u2019s absolutely necessary for some defensive purpose.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd so to seek instead to profit by it, to acquire territory, to sell it to others, to benefit from it is just completely unacceptable,\u201d he said.",
      "A United Nations commission said Tuesday that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. It called on the international community to end the campaign and punish the top officials it found responsible for inciting it.",
      "More than 65,000 people have been killed in Gaza, a grim milestone that was reached Wednesday, according to local health officials, whose numbers are considered credible by the United Nations and other international experts.",
      "The conflict began on Oct. 7, 2023, with the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and about 250 were taken hostage. The Israeli military believes about 20 of the 48 hostages still in Gaza are alive."

      "LONDON \u2014 President Donald Trump enjoys spectacle, but this is not what Britain had in mind.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer fought to offer Trump a second state visit starting Wednesday \u2014 an unprecedented flourish meant to bolster Starmer\u2019s authority and flatter the American leader at a crucial moment for the United Kingdom and its allies.",
      "Instead, Trump arrived in a fractious Britain to meet with political leaders beset by long-running discontent and royals navigating family feuds.",
      "Should he open the country's notorious tabloids, the president could survey the fallout from flag-waving far-right marchers in the streets, feverish speculation about the prime minister's position and a family summit over tea that sought to ease those royal tensions.",
      "The backdrop could hardly be worse for the carefully planned choreography of pomp and ceremony.",
      "The prime minister\u2019s hand-picked ambassador to Washington, Peter Mandelson, was fired last week after revelations of his years-old correspondence with Jeffrey Epstein, the late convicted sex offender and financier.",
      "Appointing Mandelson was billed as a savvy move designed to curry favor with Trump, but it has instead detonated into the gravest crisis of Starmer\u2019s premiership so far \u2014 crystalizing bubbling frustrations with his yearlong tenure. Starmer\u2019s deputy, Angela Rayner, also resigned in September after admitting she underpaid property taxes.",
      "Starmer's approval ratings continue to plunge as far-right Reform UK, led by Trump ally Nigel Farage, capitalizes on the public discontent to pull ahead in some polls.",
      "This has all fueled growing whispers of a leadership contest \u2014 a remarkable reversal for a prime minister who won a huge majority just 15 months ago on a vow of stability.",
      "On the streets, the mood is darker still.",
      "A far-right march led by Tommy Robinson, a convicted fraudster with a violent criminal record, drew more than 100,000 people to the streets of the capital Saturday. Elon Musk, formerly Trump\u2019s right-hand man in the White House, called into the rally. He urged a \u201cdissolution of Parliament\u201d and told attendees that \"you either fight back or you die,\" in comments that were condemned by Starmer and others.",
      "While the politics look volatile, Trump's state visit will showcase an institution Britain has long turned to as a bastion of consistency and grandeur.",
      "Yet, his arrival at Windsor Castle on Wednesday, where King Charles III is expected to make a speech in honor of the president, comes at a time when the royals are also under renewed scrutiny.",
      "Prince Andrew is back in the headlines thanks to renewed coverage of Epstein, an unwelcome reminder of unresolved questions about his role. Meanwhile, the frenzied coverage of Prince Harry\u2019s tea with the king last week has resurfaced family tensions that led father and son to go almost two years without meeting.",
      "While Harry suggested Sunday that he wants to see his father more often, relations with his brother, Prince William, the heir to the throne, do not appear to have improved.",
      "Starmer had hoped that hosting a U.S. president \u2014 with all the King\u2019s Guards, red carpets and palace banquets that it will entail \u2014 would broadcast strength and competence.",
      "But Trump's visit, analysts say, may only amplify Britain\u2019s domestic turmoil, rather than mask it.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s administration tends to be very interested in the domestic politics of European countries,\u201d said Olivia O\u2019Sullivan, director of the UK in the World Programme at the London-based think tank Chatham House.",
      "For Starmer, there\u2019s \u201ca pretty challenging landscape at home and overseas,\u201d she told NBC News, and a likelihood that Trump may \u201csay something or address something outside of the carefully diplomatically choreographed statements and announcements.\u201d",
      "The prospect of a second state visit for Trump drew criticism, with opponents accusing Starmer of needlessly flattering a deeply polarizing figure in the U.K. A mass demonstration is planned on the first day of his trip, with a further protest planned near Windsor Castle.",
      "The risk, experts argue, is that Trump\u2019s presence could further weaken Starmer at home.",
      "\u201cTrump is so unpopular with most Brits that no one \u2014 not even Nigel Farage \u2014 is going to win many voters over by being seen close to him,\u201d said Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London.",
      "A recent poll found that 70% of Britons disliked Trump, and 44% thought his state visit should be canceled.",
      "While many on Britain\u2019s far right \u201clove Trump,\u201d he added, \u201can awful lot more Brits think he\u2019s either nuts or dangerous \u2014 or both \u2014 so anyone seen to be fanboying him will get short shrift.\u201d",
      "While Trump will get his desired display of grandeur when he lands in London, turmoil bubbles underneath."
