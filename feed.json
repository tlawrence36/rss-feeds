      "MIAMI BEACH, Fla. -- The mayor of Miami Beach, Florida, wants to terminate a lease and cut financial support for an independent film theater that screened an Oscar-winning documentary about the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis.",
      "Mayor Steven Meiner introduced a resolution describing the film \u201cNo Other Land\u201d as antisemitic. City commissioners will discuss the resolution Wednesday during their next meeting.",
      "\u201cNo Other Land\u201d opened last Friday at O Cinema, located at the Miami Beach Historic City Hall. Meiner had reached out several days before the premiere to discourage O Cinema CEO Vivian Marthell from showing the film.",
      "\u201cThe City of Miami Beach has one of the highest concentrations of Jewish residents in the United States,\u201d Meiner said in his letter to Marthell. \u201cThe \u2018No Other Land\u2019 film is a one-sided propaganda attack on the Jewish people that is not consistent with the values of our City and residents.\u201d",
      "Marthell initially agreed not to screen the movie in a response to Meiner, but the showing went on as scheduled. Marthell didn't immediately respond Thursday to an email seeking comment.",
      "In December and January, the city of Miami Beach executed two grants worth about $80,000 for O Cinema, according to the mayor's proposed resolution. About half the money has already been paid, but the resolution would stop the rest. The city began leasing space to O Cinema in 2019 with the ability to terminate the contract with 180 days of notice, which is what Meiner is seeking to do.",
      "\u201cNo Other Land,\u201d which was shot between 2019 and 2023 and released last year, was directed by a group of Israeli and Palestinian filmmakers: Basel Adra, Hamdan Ballal, Yuval Abraham and Rachel Szor.",
      "\u201cWhen the mayor uses the word antisemitism to silence Palestinians and Israelis who proudly oppose occupation and apartheid together, fighting for justice and equality, he is emptying it out of meaning,\u201d Abraham said in an email. \u201cI find that to be very dangerous.\u201d",
      "The film documents the destruction of Palestinian villages in the West Bank by the Israeli military. It won the Academy Award for best documentary feature as well as earlier awards.",
      "While the film has earned wide praise from film critics, it has also drawn controversy.",
      "\u201cFreedom of expression is an important value, but defamation of Israel into a tool for international promotion is not art,\u201d Israeli culture minister Miki Zohar said in a social media post."

      "NEW YORK -- After a well-reviewed emcee debut, the Golden Globes are bringing back comedian Nikki Glaser to host the 2026 ceremony.",
      "Dick Clark Productions, the producer of the award show, announced Thursday that Glaser will return for the 83rd Globes next January. Glaser, the first woman to host the show solo, successfully shepherded a ceremony she called \u201cOzempic\u2019s biggest night.\u201d",
      "\u201cHosting the Golden Globes this year was without a doubt the most fun I have ever had in my career,\u201d said Glaser in a statement. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to do it again, and this time in front of the team from \u2018The White Lotus\u2019 who will finally recognize my talent and cast me in Season Four as a Scandinavian Pilates instructor with a shadowy past.\u201d",

      "Who killed Donald Goines",
      "DETROIT -- Who killed Donald Goines?",
      "Producers of a documentary on the life of the prisoner-turned urban fiction writer of novels about the violence, drugs and prostitution that he surrounded himself with in Detroit are hoping the answer hasn't been lost to time \u2014 or the streets.",
      "It's been more than 50 years since Goines and his common-law wife, Shirley Sailor, were found shot to death on Oct. 21, 1974 in their flat in Highland Park, a small enclave of Detroit. Each had been shot five times. Their two young children were home at the time of the killings.",
      "Goines was 37.",
      "No arrests were made and rumors swelled. Some speculated the killings had something to do with Goines' heroin addiction. Others nodded to the theory that the fictional subjects of his novels appeared a bit too much like the real-life hustlers, pimps, drug dealers and stickup men who prowled the city's streets.",
      "\u201cThere have been at least a half-dozen, quite possibly a dozen, elements of speculation as to how Mr. Goines and the mother of his children were murdered,\u201d said Bill Proctor, a private investigator hired to find the killer or killers. \u201cBut no one has come forward with enough information to charge the persons responsible.\u201d",
      "Proctor said a $5,000 reward being offered by the producers of the documentary might help \u201cshake the trees\u201d and find \u201csomeone who might still be alive or have an understanding\u201d of the facts of the case.",
      "Goines wrote 16 books over a span of several short years. His raw, stark and undiluted writings are filled with the urban street life imagery of the late 1960s and early 1970s.",
      "\u201cDopefiend,\u201d was published in 1971. Fifteen more including \u201cStreet Players,\u201d \u201cDaddy Cool\u201d and \u201cKenyatta's Last Hit,\u201d would follow over the next three years. The titles and the content resonated with many Black readers, especially in Detroit where Goines' books often held prominence on living room coffee tables and bookshelves.",
      "\u201cWhen I read his books, I can visualize \u2014 I can picture what he\u2019s writing about,\u201d said his daughter, Donna Sailor. \u201cHe was so descriptive about what he wrote. That\u2019s kind of like how it was back then.\u201d",
      "Donna Sailor was 2 when her parents were killed. She doesn\u2019t remember anything about the shooting or her parents.",
      "\u201cWe would see friends of the family that knew my dad and my mom,\u201d Sailor, 52, told The Associated Press Thursday. \u201cThey would say she was a sweetheart, and she was funny and had a great smile.\u201d",
      "Less information about Goines was volunteered, though, she added.",
      "\u201cNo one ever went into great detail about him. They would say he was a nice guy,\u201d said Sailor.",
      "The urban lit genre dates back at least to 1967, and the release of the memoir \u201cPimp,\u201d written by Robert Maupin, who also was in jail when he began writing under the name Iceberg Slim. Maupin built a large word-of-mouth following and one of his readers was Goines. Generations later, hip-hop stars like Tupac Shakur were also inspired by the books and have referenced Goines and Iceberg Slim in their recordings. Shakur even once declared: \u201cMachiavelli was my tutor, Donald Goines my father figure.\u201d",
      "Goines' parents owned a clothes-cleaning and other businesses in Detroit and were part of the city's Black middle class. He enlisted in the Air Force and spent time in Korea and Japan during the Korean War. It was there Goines became addicted to heroin, according to various reports on his life.",
      "After his time in the military, Goines returned to Detroit in the mid-1950s. He drifted into the city's criminal underbelly, finding himself jailed for various crimes.",
      "Holloway House published Goines' novels from 1971 to 2008, according to current publisher Kensington.",
      "Under Kensington, Goines books have sold about 500,000 copies in print, alone. He consistently is one of Kensington's top reordered authors and his books have been \u201cselling at a stronger pace\u201d since it launched a reissue program in 2020, according to the company.",
      "Robert (Tape) Bailey and Craig Gore are the driving forces behind the documentary which is expected to be released by the end of the year. Both read Goines\u2019 books while incarcerated, separately.",
      "Bailey, 49, was born in Detroit and now lives in Los Angeles. He spent time in federal prison as young man for possession with intent to deliver drugs in Ohio.",
      "Goines wrote in detail about things he had witnessed firsthand, Bailey said.",
      "Gore, 51, of Los Angeles, stumbled onto Goines while serving time for burglary and theft. He says that through the $5,000 reward, they hope to bring more accuracy to the documentary.",
      "\u201cWe might find nothing. We might solve the murder,\u201d he said."

      "If you ask Brian Tyree Henry about taking time off, he bursts out laughing.",
      "Since breaking out as rapper Paper Boi in the FX series \u201cAtlanta,\u201d he's become one of the busiest actors in Hollywood. He's worked consistently \u2014 with directors including Barry Jenkins, Steve McQueen and Chloe Zhao and big-name actors like Brad Pitt, Jennifer Lawrence, Chris Hemsworth and Melissa McCarthy. Henry's been nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards, a Tony Award and an Oscar.",
      "His latest role is in the limited series \u201cDope Thief\" for Apple TV+ premiering Friday. Henry and Wagner Moura play Ray and Manny, two longtime friends in Philadelphia who pose as federal agents, conducting fake raids to steal drugs and money. It's a series of easy scores until they rob the wrong people and become targets themselves. Soon they're hiding out from the real DEA and a drug kingpin while trying to keep their family safe.",
      "\u201cThe minute that Wagner and I met each other, it was an instant electricity... We just felt like we knew each other all our lives,\" said Henry. \"That is exactly what you needed for Ray and Manny.\u201d",
      "The first episode was directed by Ridley Scott, and the series was created and written by Peter Craig, adapted from a novel by Dennis Tafoya.",
      "Craig describes Henry's versatility as an actor as \"like a jazz musician... It\u2019s fantastic for a writer, because you can throw him all kinds of added moments, and he\u2019ll incorporate and use them all.\u201d",
      "When the opportunity to star in \u201cDope Thief\u201d came about, Henry was ready for that long-awaited break \u2014 from TV. He wrapped \u201cAtlanta\u201d and had \u201cabout two days off\u201d before going into another FX show, \u201cClass of \u201809,\u201d where he played a character\u2019s past, present and future, and he was exhausted.",
      "\u201cTelevision is hard, you know? Like, I hear myself complaining about it; I know it\u2019s a first world problem, but you get very attached when you\u2019re doing a series. You're living with the character for quite a long time.\"",
      "So, there Henry was at 3 a.m. on a night shoot of \u201cClass of \u201809,\" wearing prosthetics as his character\u2019s future self, when his manager presented him with the script for \u201cDope Thief.\u201d \u201cWithin the first 10 pages I was incredibly attracted to Ray and also the bond he has with Manny.\u201d",
      "Time off otherwise really hasn't been his thing (hence the laughter), but Henry is quick to remind that he\u2019s had two long breaks from acting. One was during the lockdown phase of the pandemic, and the other was during the Hollywood strikes.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re a person that\u2019s constantly on the move and the universe tells you to sit your (expletive) down, you kind of have to listen,\u201d said Henry. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have stopped had the universe not said stop.\u201d",
      "Production was underway on \u201cDope Thief\u201d when the Hollywood guild strikes were called in 2023. Henry opted to stay in Philadelphia.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t go anywhere. I made sure to be there just in case,\" said Henry, who for the first time was an executive producer on the project. He wanted to be close in proximity to his local crew. They had a cookout with bouncy castles. \u201cI would explore, or we'd go tubing and I would drive to this little town called New Hope that has a wonderful ice cream shop called Moo Hope. It was truly amazing to be present and experience that part of life for myself.\u201d",
      "Henry doesn't just bond with the crew on his sets but actors too, often walking away with new friends who happen to be very famous, like, say, Julia Roberts \u2014 whom he's currently filming a movie with in London. \u201cShe's somebody I truly cherish,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s never going to stop being weird to me,\" Henry admits. \u201cThe part that is really hard for me \u2014 that I\u2019m still fighting with \u2014 is when they tell me they\u2019re fans of my stuff and I\u2019m just like, \u2018Shut up!\u2019 I literally say it to their face.\u201d",
      "The biggest revelation about working alongside these accomplished actors is that Henry is now one of them.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, now, these are my peers, these are my contemporaries, and I can\u2019t continue to act like they\u2019re not. I can\u2019t continue to act like I have to shrink myself to fit in these spaces. I no longer have to do that. And what I also love is that they\u2019ll reaffirm that for me, too ... and that's the great part.\u201d"

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Harvey Weinstein 's #MeToo retrial next month will largely be an abridged version of the original, with one big addition: a charge based on an allegation from a woman who was not a part of the first case.",
      "But at a key pretrial hearing Wednesday, the disgraced movie mogul\u2019s lawyers cautioned that because Weinstein\u2019s 2020 rape and sexual assault conviction was overturned, the past isn't prologue \u2014 it's almost entirely irrelevant.",
      "\u201cWe can take that transcript and all the judge\u2019s rulings and throw them in the garbage,\" Weinstein\u2019s lawyer, Arthur Aidala, argued. \u201cThat trial was declared illegal by the highest court in this state.\"",
      "New York\u2019s Court of Appeals threw out Weinstein\u2019s conviction last year, setting the stage for a retrial starting April 15 in state court in Manhattan. Prosecutors say it could take about five weeks.",
      "How the retrial will play out began to take shape Wednesday as Judge Curtis Farber ruled on a number of outstanding issues, including expert testimony and the language used to describe the accusers.",
      "Farber granted a prosecution request to call a psychologist, Dawn Hughes, as an expert witness on the psychological and traumatic effects of rape and sexual assault. Hughes previously testified for actor Amber Heard at Johnny Depp\u2019s libel trial against Heard in 2022 and as a prosecution witness in singer R. Kelly\u2019s federal sex trafficking trial in Brooklyn in 2021.",
      "The judge also granted a defense request to preclude the term \u201csurvivor\u201d from being used to describe Weinstein\u2019s accusers. He told prosecutors to instruct any police officers who testify to refer to the women as \u201ccomplaining witnesses\" instead.",
      "While Weinstein\u2019s convictions from the first trial were thrown out, his acquittals on the most serious charges \u2014 two counts of predatory sexual assault and first-degree, or forcible, rape \u2014 still stand.",
      "Given that, Farber ordered prosecutors to instruct one of the accusers testifying at the retrial not to used the word \u201cforce\u201d when describing her alleged assault.",
      "The Manhattan district attorney's office had wanted to exclude any mention of Weinstein\u2019s acquittals and vacated conviction, but Farber said he could be obligated to clue them in depending on how the accuser testifies.",
      "\u201cDoes she have to use the word force? She can describe what happened and let the jury draw its own conclusions?\u201d the judge asked. \u201cI am not asking her to change her testimony from the first trial. I am asking her to refrain from using the word force.\"",
      "Other decisions were made behind closed doors as Farber met with the prosecution and defense for more than an hour in his chambers to discuss matters still under seal.",
      "They included a prosecution request that two of the three accusers in the case be allowed to testify about other alleged encounters with Weinstein. They also discussed evidence of the accusers' sexual history, which prosecutors say should be barred under New York's Rape Shield Law.",
      "Weinstein, 72, was in court for Wednesday\u2019s proceedings, arriving from jail in a wheelchair and suit and holding a stack of documents. Before the public portion of his hearing began, the ex-studio boss watched as Farber spent a few minutes resolving another matter that had been delayed by their closed-door discussions.",
      "At his last court appearance in January, Weinstein had implored Farber to start the retrial sooner.",
      "He told the judge \u201cI don\u2019t know how much longer I can hold on\u201d with cancer, heart issues and harsh conditions at New York City\u2019s Rikers Island jail complex, where he is locked up. Farber said he may hold jury selection a few days sooner if a murder trial he's overseeing wraps up ahead of schedule.",
      "Weinstein is being retried on charges that he forcibly performed oral sex on a movie and TV production assistant in 2006 and raped an aspiring actor in 2013. The additional charge, filed last September, alleges he forced oral sex on a different woman at a Manhattan hotel in 2006.",
      "Prosecutors said in court papers that the woman, who has not been identified publicly, came forward to them just days before the start of Weinstein\u2019s first trial but was not part of that case. They said they did not pursue the women\u2019s allegations after Weinstein was convicted and sentenced to 23 years in prison, but they revisited them and secured a new indictment after his conviction was thrown out.",
      "Farber ruled in October to combine the new indictment and existing charges into one trial.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyers contend that prosecutors prejudiced him by waiting nearly five years to bring the additional charge, suggesting they had elected not to include the allegation in his first trial so they could use it later if his conviction were reversed.",
      "Weinstein has denied that he raped or sexually assaulted anyone.",
      "In vacating Weinstein\u2019s conviction, the Court of Appeals ruled that the trial judge, James M. Burke, unfairly allowed testimony against him based on allegations from other women that were not part of the case. Burke is no longer on the bench and such testimony won't be part of the retrial.",
      "Weinstein was convicted in Los Angeles in 2022 of another rape. His 16-year prison sentence in that case still stands, but his lawyers appealed in June, arguing he did not get a fair trial.",

      "The Russo brothers bring Simon St\u00e5lenhag's illustrated novel \u201cThe Electric State\u201d to life in the new big budget Netflix film",
      "If an algorithm designed a classic, big-screen spectacle for the small-screen age, \u201cThe Electric State\u201d probably wouldn\u2019t be too far off the mark.",
      "This is an Amblin-inspired, big-budget adventure with dystopian, science-fiction wonder, nostalgic callbacks, well-liked stars (Chris Pratt! Millie Bobby Brown! Stanley Tucci! Giancarlo Esposito! Ke Huy Quan!) and the directors ( Joe and Anthony Russo ) behind some of the highest-earning movies of all time.",
      "In theory, it should work. A kid on a dangerous, cross-country journey with a robot that may or may not be her brother whom she thought was dead? A reluctant, jaded adult companion who\u2019s quick with a one-liner? \u201cThe Electric State\u201d should be some future Spielberg\u2019s new favorite movie, the one that they\u2019ll reference in their Oscars speech as the thing that made them want to make movies. And yet it\u2019s lacking a spark and a soul that might distinguish it as memorable or special. Worse, considering everything it has going for it (including a reported budget that may have exceeded $300 million), \u201cThe Electric State\u201d is kind of dull.",
      "\u201cThe Electric State\u201d was loosely based on an illustrated novel by Simon St\u00e5lenhag that was released in 2018 and quickly scooped up for movie adaptation purposes with Marvel veterans Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely writing the script. Set in the early 1990s, this is a world in which service robots have risen up and demanded rights and freedom. The humans respond by going to war.",
      "This four-year war is skimmed over in a montage at the start of the film and, by 1994, Mr. Peanut (Woody Harrelson) is signing a peace treaty with Bill Clinton and the remaining robots are exiled to rot in the desert. The human victory was attributed to the drone creations of a Steve Jobs-ian tech billionaire Ethan Skate (Tucci), who is soon hawking his \u201cNeurocasters\u201d to the public. They scoop it up and soon society is just a bleak wasteland of screen zombies content to let their avatars work while they relax and fantasize a way out of their downtrodden existence.",
      "There are shades of \u201cThe Creator,\u201d \u201cWALL-E,\u201d \u201cReady Player One\u201d and many, many more films in here. But no one gets mad that something is derivative if it\u2019s also good. It\u2019s only when the kitchen sink references are so clear and come up so short that it becomes a real problem.",
      "Brown plays Michelle, an angry, orphaned teenager who lost her entire family not in the war, but in a car wreck. The one she misses the most is her little brother Christopher (Woody Norman, giving the best, most emotionally authentic performance in the film), a reluctant child prodigy. One day, a robot of a cartoon character they used to watch together turns up at her foster home, speaking only in the character\u2019s catchphrases. But after some gestures toward a photograph, she starts to believe that this robot is, somehow, Christopher, or at least someone who can lead her to the real Christopher. And thus starts their journey across America, and into the robot \u201cexclusion zone\u201d to figure out this puzzle. They soon team up with a war veteran/smuggler Keats (Pratt) and his snarky robot sidekick (Anthony Mackie, for your Marvel bingo card) and try to evade Esposito\u2019s robot bounty hunter.",
      "The robots they find in the exclusion zone are voiced by an army of celebrities you\u2019ll go insane trying to place before angrily resorting to IMDb, including Harrelson, Hank Azaria, Brian Cox and Jenny Slate. Their designs are thoughtful and remarkable and should evoke a sense of awe in the viewer at the sheer ingenuity behind this film, where many of the most impressive shots seem to be the recreations of St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s illustrations of dismantled, decaying robots. The action, however, gets mind-numbingly repetitive by the end of the bloated runtime.",
      "Pratt and Brown, while fine individually, don\u2019t really find their groove as partners on this journey either. Pratt is kind of just doing his thing and gets the few clever one-liners in the script. Brown, meanwhile, seems a little bored by yet another teen adventure role. And both ultimately look like movie stars in '90s cosplay, which might be a metaphor for the larger failure of the movie.",
      "\u201cThe Electric State\u201d was, of course, not made by algorithm, which is an admittedly cheap shot for a Netflix original. Unfortunately, it just feels that way.",
      "\u201cThe Electric State,\u201d a Netflix release streaming Friday, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csci-fi violence/action, language and some thematic material.\u201d Running time: 128 minutes. One and a half stars out of four."

      "President Donald Trump's team is looking at locations for a post-administration presidential library, and Florida may take that spot",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President Donald Trump's team is already looking for locations for his presidential library, and Florida may be a top contender.",
      "A Florida legislator said Monday that the state has a \u201chigh likelihood\u201d of getting its first presidential library.",
      "Presidential libraries are significant for post-administration historical archives depicting materials from a former president's term. They require years of planning and don't use federal funding.",
      "Here are a few things to know about a potential Trump presidential library:",
      "The state Senate Rules Committee on Wednesday unanimously backed Sen. Jason Brodeur's bill that he said would \u201cprevent any municipality or county from imposing frivolous obstacles to the establishment of a presidential library within the state.\u201d",
      "Brodeur said other states that built presidential libraries had construction roadmaps created to follow state and local laws, and Florida would need the same. He also said all former presidents are welcome to put a presidential library in Florida, not just Trump.",
      "\u201cI anticipate that this will be a pretty popular attraction. It is somebody who\u2019s likely even the most famous developer in the world right now,\u201d he said.",
      "Brodeur's bill comes as Trump's team is looking at several South Florida universities \u2014 including Florida Atlantic University and Florida International University \u2014 as potential spots for a presidential library.",
      "A secretary at the FAU president\u2019s office said she had not heard of any plans for a presidential library and declined to comment further. Spokespeople for FAU and FIU, and the White House press office didn't immediately respond to messages about possible plans for a presidential library.",
      "Traditionally, such libraries are built in the state where a president was born or grew up. Trump, though, was born in New York, which voted against him in three straight presidential elections and which made him the first former president to be convicted of felonies last year.",
      "Trump now primarily lives in Florida, and he's filled his administration's ranks with politicians and others from the Sunshine State.",
      "Democrats raised concerns in committee hearings about whether local residents would bear the costs of the library's construction. Brodeur said all costs of building the library, including the planning costs, would fall to the president and library archives.",
      "In December, ABC News agreed to pay $15 million toward a Trump presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit. In the agreement, ABC News described the payment as a \u201ccharitable contribution\u201d to an escrow account being managed by Trump's attorney.",
      "That's would amount to a small fraction of the overall cost of building the library. For example, former President Barack Obama\u2019s library in Chicago was estimated to cost $830 million as of 2021.",
      "Little is known about what would be in a Trump presidential library, but materials in these libraries usually include documents, artifacts or items significant to a president\u2019s administration.",
      "Earlier this month the Justice Department returned the boxes coming from the FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago home in 2022 for classified documents. Trump said in a Truth Social post that these boxes were being sent to Florida, where they \u201cwill someday be part of the Trump Presidential Library.\u201d"

      "There's a crackling patter to \u201cBlack Bag\u201d \u2014 Steven Soderbergh\u2019s marital drama cloaked as a sleek spy thriller",
      "If you\u2019re hosting a dinner for half a dozen British intelligence agents with the aim of ferreting out a mole, what should you cook?",
      "For George Woodhouse (Michael Fassbender), who's preparing for four colleagues, plus himself and his wife, Kathryn St. Jean (Cate Blanchett), who, like him, is a high-level operative, it\u2019s chana masala with a few drops of truth serum.",
      "\u201cWill there be any mess to clean up?\u201d Kathryn asks her husband as they\u2019re getting ready.",
      "\u201cWith any luck,\u201d he responds.",
      "So goes much of the crackling patter of \u201cBlack Bag,\u201d Steven Soderbergh\u2019s delicious marital drama cloaked as a sleek spy thriller. Lean and taut, the 93-minute \u201cBlack Bag\u201d is more a sizzling amuse-bouche than full-course meal, but it\u2019s simmered to perfection.",
      "George and Kathryn, as fellow agents at London\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre, don\u2019t seemingly have what you might call a traditional marriage. Each has their own secret ops, leaving large swaths of their lives off limits to the other. When George asks where Kathryn is flying off to on Wednesday, she shrugs with a smile, \u201cBlack bag.\u201d",
      "In the movie\u2019s opening scene \u2013 a slinky tracking shot that trails George into and out of a nightclub \u2013 an agent named Meacham (Gustaf Skarsgard) gives him the assignment to track down the mole, with the added wrinkle that Kathryn can\u2019t be dismissed as a possible suspect. A cyber-worm device called Severus that\u2019s capable of hacking into nuclear facilities has gone missing. The fate of the world, as it so often is, is said to be at stake.",
      "But, really, the state of George and Kathryn\u2019s marriage is what interests us. Extreme though their situation is, their union is one that, like any couple, is built on trust and devotion, even if their professional lives demand the inverse. When George, lying on top of Kathryn tells her he\u2019d do anything for her, she coos, \u201cWould you kill?\u201d It's a fair-enough test to the bounds of wedded bliss, sure, but her second question matters even more. \u201cWould you lie?\u201d",
      "Over that dinner \u2013 a scintillating set piece around a darkened dinner table inside their London town house \u2013 we can quickly gather just how much the truth means to George. He\u2019s renown for his powers with a polygraph. As a youngster, he even brought down his own father, uncovering his affair. \u201cI don\u2019t like liars,\u201d George says through clenched teeth.",
      "They\u2019re joined by Colonel James Stokes (Reg\u00e9-Jean Page); the in-house psychologist Dr. Zoe Vaughan (Naomie Harris); the carousing spy Freddie Smalls (Tom Burke); and the newest NCSC recruit, cyber specialist Clarissa (Marisa Abela). Both are paired off in clandestine relationships that quickly emerge, among other secrets. More than state secrets, infidelity dominates the conversation.",
      "Fassbender\u2019s spook is an agent of precision. He wears gleaming black-framed glasses. When only a few drops of sauce land on his cuff, he immediately withdraws to change his shirt. Hard as it would seem, Fassbender has found a character almost as dispassionate and monotone as his methodical assassin in David Fincher\u2019s \u201cThe Killer.\u201d",
      "This time, though, he's not a loner. Blanchett\u2019s Kathryn is kept more at a remove from us. She\u2019s mysterious and aloof \u2013 a femme fatale, maybe, we\u2019re led to wonder. An \u201caroma of hostility\u201d accompanies her, Zoe tells her in a psych evaluation. Is she the mole?",
      "This is an insular film, taking place mainly in crisply composed interiors, aside from the lake George occasionally fishes for bass in. There, in a fitting encapsulation of a movie full of smooth surfaces with currents twisting underneath, the camera gently rests on the water's surface.",
      "\u201cBlack Bag\u201d follows a run of agilely directed thrillers by Soderbergh made with screenwriter David Koepp ( \u201cPresence,\u201d \u201cKimi\u201d). They are both at the height of their almost-too-easy powers; the script, especially, is peppered with delectable dialogue. Their movie adopts the air of menace and suspicion of a John Le Carr\u00e9 novel, yet hinges on the sturdiness of its married couple, like a super spy version of Nick and Nora from \u201cThe Thin Man\" or a more cerebral \u201cMr. & Mrs. Smith.\u201d",
      "All of the supporting players \u2013 while they make up a fine ensemble \u2013 are ultimately playthings in their game of love. In a casting coup, a former James Bond \u2013 Pierce Brosnan \u2013 drops in late in the film as Arthur Stheiglitz, the head of NCSC. In his handful of scenes, Brosnan is rageful and ferocious, chomping into both Ikizukuri (prepared live fish) and the scenery.",
      "His presence both enlivens a movie already humming with the uber-cool chemistry of Blanchett and Fassbender while transforming \u201cBlack Bag\u201d into a twisty rejoinder to that notoriously skirt-chasing spy. Here, Mr. Bond, is how sexy monogamy can be.",
      "While directing a satellite to peer down upon his wife on some unknown mission in Europe, George explains their mystifying dynamic to Clarissa: \u201cI watch her, and she watches me. If she gets into trouble, I will do everything in my power to extricate her.\u201d",
      "In her response, Clarissa speaks for everyone: \u201cThat\u2019s so hot.\u201d",
      "\u201cBlack Bag,\u201d a Focus Features release is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language including some sexual references, and some violence. Running time: 93 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four."

      "Nathan Caine may not be able to feel pain, as the tagline for the new action-comedy \u201cNovocaine\u201d reads, but the same does not apply to audiences.",
      "Although he doesn\u2019t scream when his leg is impaled with an arrow or when he sticks his hand in a vat of frying oil, you might. I certainly did. Out loud. In a theater. With other people. There may have been some phrases uttered entirely involuntarily too. Were other people reacting in the same way, I wonder? I couldn\u2019t hear them over my own groans. Hooray for the communal experience, I guess?",
      "This is, in some ways, a film for people who thought John Wick wasn\u2019t stabby enough. It delights in the relentless mutilation of its hero, a regular guy (played by Jack Quaid ) with a rare condition that has rendered him immune from feeling any sort of discomfort to bodily harm. Unlike such high concept premises as \u201cCrank,\u201d congenital insensitivity to pain analgesia (or CIPA) is actually real. But it\u2019s not exactly a superpower, Nate explains. He can still die; it just might be because he hasn\u2019t emptied his bladder in many hours. Or because he's accidentally bitten his tongue off eating a sandwich. These are real concerns of his.",
      "His entire existence is devoted to preventing these kinds of crises, mostly through tried-and-true baby proofing techniques like using tennis balls on sharp corners. Like Kelly Ripa before a show, he only consumes \u201cnon-chewing food.\u201d",
      "Work is stable and dull as an assistant manager at a bank. And dating is out of the question; He spends most of his free time playing online video games. Quaid, even with his two movie star parents, is somehow believable as this cautious introvert, though everything is played with a light touch and a wink. The movie, written by Lars Jacobson and directed by Dan Berk and Robert Olsen, even begins with the mournful R.E.M. anthem \u201cEverybody Hurts.\u201d",
      "Then Nate\u2019s life is changed one day when a pretty teller at the bank, Sherry (Amber Midthunder), asks him out to lunch, then to drinks and even spends the night. The next morning, things get even crazier: Sherry is taken hostage after a violent robbery at the bank. These guys are capital B bad (led by fellow nepo spawn Ray Nicholson) killing both the bank manager the cops outside. So what does Nate do? He steals a cop car and attempts to save her himself.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t do it,\u201d pleads an injured cop as Nate hesitates before apprehending the car. It\u2019s hard to argue with the cop: Why not just let the professionals handle it, understaffed though they may be over the Christmas holiday? It would be a rather short and pointless movie if he did just leave it to the cops, but the impetus for this quest is a stretch to say the least. The conceit is missing some extra justification of why he felt like he was the only one who could do it, especially once he actually talks to said cops (Betty Gabriel and Matt Walsh).",
      "Like many things in \u201cNovocaine,\u201d it simply exists to open more avenues for his torture. This involves a fight in a restaurant kitchen, a visit to a tattoo parlor to get more information on one of the robbers, and a stop by a booby-trapped house. The script is self-aware enough to throw in a \u201cHome Alone\u201d reference, though not before you\u2019ve made one in your head.",
      "On the heels of some bad action comedies like \u201cLove Hurts,\u201d \u201cNovocaine\u201d is pretty enjoyable. It might have been born in the same elevator pitch incubator (what if non-stop violence!), but it\u2019s executed with some style and understanding of comedic timing. In one clever sequence, Nate persuades his psychotic captor to torture him as slowly as possible, buying time until his friend gets there as he pretends to feel the pain. \u201cNovocaine\u201d also kind of overstays its welcome, stretching on too long with too many endings. Still, it\u2019s an easy, if not entirely painless, watch.",
      "\u201cNovocaine,\u201d a Paramount Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201cstrong, bloody violence, language throughout, grisly images). Running time: 110 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four."

      "\u201cOur current stadium has served us brilliantly for the past 115 years, but it has fallen behind the best arenas in world sport,\u201d part owner Jim Ratcliffe said. \u201cBy building next to the existing site, we will be able to preserve the essence of Old Trafford, while creating a truly state-of-the-art stadium that transforms the fan experience only footsteps from our historic home.\u201d",

      "United wants the venue to be part of a wider project to regenerate the surrounding Old Trafford area, which it said would be worth 7.3 billion pounds ($9.4 billion) to the U.K. economy. The U.K. government has already voiced its support for the project, although the specifics of how it would be funded are not known.",

      "JAIPUR, India -- The film that was submitted as India\u2019s official Oscar entry but failed to make the final list of nominees has swept the International Indian Film Academy Awards, which recognize outstanding work in the country's film industry.",
      "Director Kiran Rao\u2019s critically acclaimed \u201cLaapataa Ladies\u201d \u2014 renamed \u201cLost Ladies\u201d for its Oscar campaign \u2014 emerged as the biggest winner at the 2025 IIFA Awards, bagging 10 wins, including best picture and best direction.",
      "The 2023 comedy is about two veiled brides who are accidentally swapped during a train ride, and tackles issues of patriarchy and gender roles, a shift from decades of male-centered mainstream Indian movies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a rare privilege to win an award for a film like \u2018Laapataa Ladies.' It\u2019s been a wonderful night. It\u2019s a rare privilege to make a film like this,\u201d Rao said in her acceptance speech.",
      "Rao's film \u2014 a rare departure from most Bollywood films, which typically feature song-and-dance routines, violence and melodrama \u2014 also won in categories for best story, best screenplay and best actress in a leading role.",
      "The annual ceremony of IIFA began in the western city of Jaipur on Saturday and concluded Sunday.",
      "Indian cinema\u2019s most recognizable names took part in the glitzy event and Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan and actor Shahid Kapoor were among those who performed at the ceremony. The event was hosted by veteran director and producer Karan Johar and actor Kartik Aaryan.",
      "The awards show also presents an opportunity for Indian celebrities to showcase their fashion, and this year was no exception. Notable figures such as Madhuri Dixit, Katrina Kaif and Kareena Kapoor Khan displayed their fashion choices on the green carpet."

According to studio estimates Sunday, the Robert Pattinson-led film earned $19.1 million in its first weekend in theaters, which was enough to dethrone \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World\u201d after a three-week reign.",
      "Overseas, \u201cMickey 17\u201d has already made $34.2 million, bringing its worldwide total to $53.3 million. But profitability for the film is a long way off: It cost a reported $118 million to produce, which does not account for millions spent on marketing and promotion.",

It\u2019s an original film from an Oscar-winning director led by a big star that was afforded a blockbuster budget and given a robust theatrical release by Warner Bros., one of the few major studios remaining. But despite all of that, and reviews that were mostly positive (79% on RottenTomatoes), audiences did not treat it as an event movie, and it may ultimately struggle to break even.",
      "Originally set for release in March 2024, Bong Joon Ho\u2019s follow-up to the Oscar-winning \u201cParasite\u201d faced several delays, which he has attributed to extenuating circumstances around the Hollywood strikes. Based on the novel \u201cMickey7\u201d by Edward Ashton, Pattinson plays an expendable employee who dies on missions and is re-printed time and time again. Steven Yeun, Naomi Ackie, Toni Collette and Mark Ruffalo also star.",
      "It opened in 3,807 locations domestically where it performed best in New York and Los Angeles. Premium large format showings, including IMAX screens, also accounted for nearly half of its opening weekend. Internationally, it did especially well in Korea, where it made an estimated $14.6 million.",

      "Flack was one of the top recording artists of the 1970s and an influential performer due to her intimate vocal and musical style, died last month. She was 88.",
      "Flack's \u201cCelebration of Life\u201d memorial will be livestreamed from New York on Monday afternoon.",
      "Here's everything you need to know:",

      "It is a fitting location: Flack grew up with church gospel; her mother played organ at the Lomax African Methodist Episcopal Church in Arlington, Virginia. As a teen, she began accompanying the church choir on piano.",
      "Flack leaves behind a rich repertoire of music that avoids categorization. Her debut, \u201cFirst Take,\u201d wove soul, jazz, flamenco, gospel and folk into one revelatory package, prescient in its form and measured in its approach.",
      "She will likely be remembered for her classics.

      "But most will think of \u201cKilling Me Softly with His Song\" when Flack's name comes up in conversation. She first heard Lori Lieberman\u2019s \u201cKilling Me Softly with His Song\u201d while on a plane and immediately fell in love with it. While on tour with Quincy Jones, she covered the song, and the audience feel in love with it, too, as they\u2019d continue to for decades.",

      "Aid agencies distributing U.S. food aid in Ethiopia's war-affected Tigray region say they have had to stop feeding millions of people because of the Trump administration's restrictions on foreign aid",
      "MEKELE, Ethiopia -- As a displaced person in Ethiopia\u2019s northern Tigray region, 76-year-old Haile Tsege is no stranger to hunger.",
      "During its war with Tigray fighters that devastated the region in 2020-2022, Ethiopian government restrictions on the rebellious region reduced aid flows to a trickle. Then in 2023, U.S. and U.N. aid distributions of grain were halted for months over a corruption scandal.",
      "Now the Trump administration\u2019s dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, has again halted food deliveries to a sprawling camp of over 20,000 people outside Tigray\u2019s regional capital, Mekele.",
      "\u201cWe will just die in silence,\u201d said Tsege, one of the 2.4 million people in Tigray who depend on humanitarian grain, most of it provided by the U.S.",
      "Ethiopia with its over 125 million people had been the biggest beneficiary of U.S. aid in sub-Saharan Africa, receiving $1.8 billion in the 2023 financial year. In addition to life-saving food, the funds were spent on HIV medications, vaccines, literacy programs and jobs creation, as well as services for 1 million refugees hosted by Ethiopia.",
      "Most of these programs have been stopped. The USAID staffers who oversaw them have been placed on administrative leave and told not to work, as they face the threat of termination. The U.S. Embassy didn't respond to questions.",
      "Emergency food was exempted from President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order, signed on his first day in office, suspending foreign aid during a 90-day review amid the administration's allegations of waste.",
      "Aid agencies in Ethiopia had to apply to USAID for waivers to continue handing out U.S. grain. These have been secured, but USAID\u2019s payments system is still not functioning.",
      "As a result, a consortium of aid agencies in Tigray has had to stop distributions to the over 1 million people it has been responsible for feeding with U.S.-provided grain. It has no money to pay for fuel, trucks and drivers to distribute existing food stockpiles.",
      "That includes 5,000 metric tons of sorghum \u2013 enough to feed 300,000 people for a month \u2013 stuck in a storage facility in Mekele that could rot before it reaches those in need.",
      "\u201cThis is just one warehouse. There are several others across the region,\u201d said Teklewoini Assefa, head of the Relief Society of Tigray, part of the consortium. \u201cThis will create malnutrition, disease. If this situation continues, what follows? Death.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cEverything boils down to the payment system.\u201d",
      "The effects of the aid cuts are widespread, with many USAID contracts terminated. Already, Ethiopia has been forced to lay off 5,000 local healthcare workers who were working on its HIV response.",
      "Tigray relied heavily on U.S. funds. More than two years after the war killed hundreds of thousands, full-scale recovery efforts are yet to start. The region\u2019s health system is in ruins and hundreds of schools remain closed.",
      "In 2024, child malnutrition stood at 21% in some areas, according to a survey reviewed by The Associated Press \u2014 far above the World Health Organization\u2019s threshold of 15% at which a situation is classified as an emergency.",
      "Now, aid workers say many programs to improve nutrition have halted. Projects to deliver medicines and vaccines have stopped. Dozens of camps for displaced people have had water sources cut off.",
      "\u201cThe impact has been huge,\u201d said Ashenafi Asmelash, executive director of Mums for Mums, which has had two USAID- funded programs terminated. One helped build long-term resilience among farmers. The other helped improve the nutrition of children and new mothers.",
      "Management Sciences for Health, another Tigray organization, has halted a project to combat tuberculosis and told its staff to expect mass layoffs in March, according to a senior executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.",
      "Efforts to assist thousands of women who were raped during the war have been derailed, said Rigat Bishaw at Ayder Hospital, Tigray\u2019s biggest healthcare facility.",
      "This includes counseling and physiotherapy sessions for survivors run by the U.S.-based Center for Victims of Torture, which received a stop-work order from the Trump administration in February and furloughed its staff.",
      "CVT also halted a program to train health workers to recognize sexual abuse cases and refer survivors to appropriate health services.",
      "\u201cThis sudden disruption is having a huge impact on the healing of traumatized people,\u201d said Yohannes Fisseha, a CVT manager.",
      "Major projects to support people living with HIV, improve access to life-saving nutrition services and improve relations between war-affected communities have also been cut off, said Yirga Gebregziabher, the Tigray branch manager of an Ethiopian organization called OSSHD, which helped implement the projects.",

The aid cuts, which affect governments and their partners in the non-governmental sector, have shut down or disrupted projects tackling diseases ranging from malaria to AIDS.",
      "Much of the funding to the Africa CDC and regional governments was lost with the Trump administration\u2019s decision to terminate most foreign aid contracts and cut $60 billion in overall U.S. assistance abroad. Many of the affected programs are in fragile countries that are highly reliant on U.S. aid to support health systems, nutrition programs and stave off starvation.",

      "Aid cuts have impeded the collection and transportation of samples in Congo, Kaseya said.",

      "The Trump Administration's quest to \u201cMake America Health Again\u201d is targeting ultraprocessed foods",
      "In the Trump administration\u2019s quest to \u201cMake America Healthy Again,\u201d there may be no bigger target than ultraprocessed foods.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation\u2019s new health secretary, has cited \u201chighly chemically processed foods\u201d as a chief culprit behind an epidemic of chronic disease in the U.S., including ailments such as obesity, diabetes and autoimmune disorders.",
      "Such foods are \u201cpoisoning\u201d people, particularly children, Kennedy said during Senate confirmation hearings. He has vowed to work to remove such foods from federal programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.",
      "\u201cI will do everything in my power to put the health of Americans back on track,\u201d he told lawmakers.",
      "Key to that goal, however, could be making sure that consumers understand basic facts about ultraprocessed foods and the role they play in daily meals.",
      "From sugary cereals at breakfast to frozen pizzas at dinner, plus in-between snacks of potato chips, sodas and ice cream, ultraprocessed foods make up about 60% of the U.S. diet. For kids and teens, it\u2019s even higher \u2014 about two-thirds of what they eat.",
      "That\u2019s concerning because ultraprocessed foods have been linked to a host of negative health effects, from obesity and diabetes to heart disease, depression, dementia and more. One recent study suggested that eating these foods may raise the risk of early death.",
      "Nutrition science is tricky, though, and most research so far has found connections, not proof, regarding the health consequences of these foods.",
      "Food manufacturers argue that processing boosts food safety and supplies and offers a cheap, convenient way to provide a diverse and nutritious diet.",
      "Even if the science were clear, it\u2019s hard to know what practical advice to give when ultraprocessed foods account for what one study estimates is more than 70% of the U.S. food supply.",
      "The Associated Press asked several nutrition experts and here\u2019s what they said:",
      "Most foods are processed, whether it\u2019s by freezing, grinding, fermentation, pasteurization or other means. In 2009, Brazilian epidemiologist Carlos Monteiro and colleagues first proposed a system that classifies foods according to the amount of processing they undergo, not by nutrient content.",
      "At the top of the four-tier scale are foods created through industrial processes and with ingredients such as additives, colors and preservatives that you couldn\u2019t duplicate in a home kitchen, said Kevin Hall, a researcher who focuses on metabolism and diet at the National Institutes of Health.",
      "\u201cThese are most, but not all, of the packaged foods you see,\u201d Hall said.",
      "Such foods are often made to be both cheap and irresistibly delicious, said Dr. Neena Prasad, director of the Bloomberg Philanthropies\u2019 Food Policy Program.",
      "\u201cThey have just the right combination of sugar, salt and fat and you just can\u2019t stop eating them,\u201d Prasad said",
      "However, the level of processing alone doesn\u2019t determine whether a food is unhealthy or not, Hall noted. Whole-grain bread, yogurt, tofu and infant formula are all highly processed, for instance, but they\u2019re also nutritious.",
      "Here\u2019s the tricky part. Many studies suggest that diets high in such foods are linked to negative health outcomes. But these kinds of studies can\u2019t say whether the foods themselves are the cause of the negative effects \u2014 or whether there\u2019s something else about the people who eat these foods that might be responsible.",
      "Ultraprocessed foods, as a group, tend to have higher amounts of sodium, saturated fat and sugar, and tend to be lower in fiber and protein. It\u2019s not clear whether it\u2019s just these nutrients that are driving the effects.",
      "Hall and his colleagues were the first to conduct a small but influential experiment that directly compared the results of eating similar diets made of ultraprocessed versus unprocessed foods.",
      "Published in 2019, the research included 20 adults who went to live at an NIH center for a month. They received diets of ultraprocessed and unprocessed foods matched for calories, sugar, fat, fiber and macronutrients for two weeks each and were told to eat as much as they liked.",
      "When participants ate the diet of ultraprocessed foods, they consumed about 500 calories per day more than when they ate unprocessed foods, researchers found \u2014 and they gained an average of about 2 pounds (1 kilogram) during the study period. When they ate only unprocessed foods for the same amount of time, they lost about 2 pounds (1 kilogram).",
      "Hall is conducting a more detailed study now, but the process is slow and costly and results aren\u2019t expected until late next year. He and others argue that such definitive research is needed to determine exactly how ultraprocessed foods affect consumption.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s better to understand the mechanisms by which they drive the deleterious health consequences, if they\u2019re driving them,\u201d he said.",
      "Some advocates, like Prasad, argue that the large body of research linking ultraprocessed foods to poor health should be more than enough to spur government and industry to change policies. She calls for actions such as increased taxes on sugary drinks, stricter sodium restrictions for manufacturers and cracking down on marketing of such foods to children.",
      "\u201cDo we want to risk our kids getting sicker while we wait for this perfect evidence to emerge?\u201d Prasad said.",
      "Last year, former FDA Commissioner Robert Califf broached the subject, telling a conference of food policy experts that ultraprocessed foods are \u201cone of the most complex things I\u2019ve ever dealt with.\u201d",
      "But, he concluded, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to have the scientific basis and then we\u2019ve got to follow through.\u201d",
      "In countries like the U.S., it\u2019s hard to avoid highly processed foods \u2014 and it's not clear which ones should be targeted, said Aviva Musicus, science director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, which advocates for food policies.",
      "\u201cThe range of ultraprocessed foods is just so wide,\u201d she said.",
      "Instead, it\u2019s better to be mindful of the ingredients in foods. Check the labels and make choices that align with the current dietary guidelines, she suggested.",
      "\u201cWe have really good evidence that added sugar is not great for us. We have evidence that high-sodium foods are not great for us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have great evidence that fruits and vegetables which are minimally processed are really good for us.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s important not to vilify certain foods, she added. Many consumers don\u2019t have the time or money to cook most meals from scratch.",
      "\u201cFoods should be joyous and delicious and shouldn\u2019t involve moral judgment,\u201d Musicus said.",

India had six of the nine most polluted cities with the industrial town of Byrnihat in northeastern India the worst.",

      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- New Mexico has paired up with the Alzheimer's Association in a pilot U.S. initiative aimed at raising awareness about a disease that affects several million people across the nation, including family members and friends who often provide countless hours of unpaid care.",
      "The joint campaign \u2014 a year in the making \u2014 features billboards, digital ads and social media posts. It was unveiled Wednesday, days after authorities confirmed that actor Gene Hackman died at his Santa Fe home of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",
      "Hackman, like the majority of people with Alzheimer\u2019s and related dementias, lived at home. His wife, Betsy Arakawa, was his caregiver but died from hantavirus, a rare, rodent-borne disease. Experts believe Hackman, in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's, was unable to seek help.",
      "The goal of the new partnership between the state and the Alzheimer's Association is to spark conversations within families and to educate the public on warning signs and treatments. It also aims to publicize support services for family members and other caregivers.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s kind of the whole point of the campaign \u2014 to start talking, to start thinking, to take some action,\u201d said Joey Long, a spokesperson with the state Aging and Long-Term Services Department. \u201cSo it's like, maybe they\u2019ve been confused. Well, let\u2019s talk about what that means.\u201d",
      "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 7 million people are living with the disease in the U.S., where Alzheimer\u2019s is the seventh-leading cause of death. In New Mexico, estimates put the number of people with the disease at 46,000, with another 67,000 family members providing care at home within the last year.",

      "Neurologists say it can take 20 years from the start of the disease taking shape in the brain to when it becomes recognizable and diagnosed, what Herlihy describes as a glacial pace.",
      "\u201cPeople think of this as either an old person\u2019s disease or something that happens to somebody else,\u201d Herlihy said. \u201cAnd unless it\u2019s happened in your family and you have seen a loved one decline from this disease, or you have been put into the role of being a caregiver, you don\u2019t realize the impact that this has.\u201d",

      "A significant percentage of New Mexico's population is aging, which has spurred officials to find ways to educate and prepare state residents. In addition to the awareness campaign, the state is planning a series of community forums on the subject this spring in rural areas with high rates of the disease.",
      "The Alzheimer's Association is hoping the campaign will expand to other states."

      "NEW YORK -- Dr. David Weldon had been out of the national spotlight for more than 15 years when he was nominated to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But many anti-vaccine advocates knew him well.",
      "\u201cHe is one of us!! Since before our movement had momentum,\u201d the co-director of Mississippi Parents for Vaccine Rights wrote on Facebook. And on X, formerly known as Twitter, the Autism Action Network credited the former congressman with introducing legislation two decades ago \u201cto stop the vaccine pedocide.\u201d",
      "Weldon, who was nominated by President Donald Trump, needs to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate before he can lead the nation\u2019s top public health agency. His confirmation hearing is to be held Thursday.",
      "The 71-year-old retired Florida congressman is considered to be closely aligned with his presumptive boss, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. health secretary who for years has been one of the nation's leading anti-vaccine activists.",
      "Department of Health and Human Services officials declined to make Weldon or Kennedy available for an Associated Press interview.",
      "When he made the nomination announcement, Trump said Weldon \u201cwill proudly restore the CDC to its true purpose, and will work to end the Chronic Disease Epidemic, and Make America Healthy Again!\u201d",
      "The CDC was created nearly 80 years ago to prevent the spread of malaria in the U.S. Its mission was later expanded, and it gradually became a global leader on infectious and chronic diseases and a go-to source of health information.",
      "Today, the Atlanta-based agency has a more than $9 billion core budget. It had about 13,000 employees when Trump took office, but more than 500 were fired as part of a dramatic \u2014 and continuing \u2014 push by the president and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk to cut staffing across federal agencies.",
      "Weldon has no experience in federal public heath, but that isn't unusual. The last few presidential administrations \u2014 both Democratic and Republican \u2014 have appointed outsiders with no CDC experience.",
      "Unlike Weldon, however, those outsiders had been public health researchers or had run state health departments. He is an Army veteran and internal medicine doctor whose main claim to fame was representing a central Florida district in Congress from 1995 to 2009.",
      "After he left Congress, Weldon practiced medicine in Florida, taught at the Florida Institute of Technology, served as board chairman for the Israel Allies Foundation and made unsuccessful runs at federal and state elected office. In a March 1 letter to HHS, Weldon said that if confirmed he will resign from the foundation and from two Florida health-care organizations. He also promised to sell his holdings in funds investing in energy, pharmaceutical and health-care companies.",
      "Weldon was a leader of a Congressional push for research into autism\u2019s causes, which began around 2000. It was fueled by a controversial \u2014 and ultimately discredited \u2014 study by British researcher Dr. Andrew Wakefield that claimed to find a link between the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and autism.",
      "The action in Congress was driven largely by U.S. Rep. Dan Burton, an Indiana Republican whose grandson had autism. Weldon was a prominent voice in Burton\u2019s hearings and co-sponsored a bill that would give responsibility for the nation\u2019s vaccine safety to an independent agency within HHS \u2014 an idea that not everyone in public health opposes.",
      "But Weldon also rejected studies that found no causal link between childhood vaccines and autism, and accused the CDC of short-circuiting research that might show otherwise.",
      "Meanwhile, Weldon was a friend to practitioners of fringe medicine. When Weldon invited Wakefield to testify before Congress, he also brought in Dr. James \u201cJeff\u201d Bradstreet, who used alternative medicine to try to treat autistic children. Bradstreet died in 2015, after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration raided his office, of a gunshot wound that police labeled a suicide.",
      "Weldon later appeared in \u201cVaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe,\u201d a 2016 documentary directed by Wakefield and produced by Del Bigtree, an activist who later became the manager of Kennedy\u2019s 2024 presidential campaign. In the movie, Weldon repeated suspicions and accusations about CDC that he\u2019d made as a congressman.",
      "Kennedy has argued that experts who advise the CDC on vaccine policy have conflicts from working with, or receiving money from, pharmaceutical companies. Those advisers routinely disclose conflicts in public meetings, but the CDC last week launched a web tool \u201cto increase the transparency of conflicts of interest.\u201d",
      "At Thursday's hearing, Democrats are likely to press Weldon on his vaccine views and his plans for the agency under a health secretary who has shown disdain for it.",
      "Dr. Anne Schuchat worked at the CDC for 33 years before retiring in 2021, and twice served as acting director. She said she doesn\u2019t know Weldon, but that agency directors gradually develop an appreciation and respect for its work.",
      "If Weldon follows a similar pattern, she said, he could be a great asset: His Capitol Hill experience could help CDC secure funding and political support.",
      "\u201cWith an optimistic view, there\u2019s lot you can build on, with what he has on paper,\u201d she said. \u201cWith a pessimistic view, if he wants the job to tear the place down, that would be disappointing \u2014 and dangerous.\u201d",

      "HARTFORD, Conn. -- Despite finding \u201cimproprieties\u201d were committed by a prosecutor, the Connecticut Supreme Court on Monday upheld the murder conviction of a man found guilty of killing his wife in a case that drew wide attention because the victim's Fitbit exercise tracker contradicted his statements to police.",
      "The justices ruled in a 6-0 decision that Richard Dabate was not deprived of a fair trial because of four missteps by the prosecutor they called \u201ctroubling,\u201d including referring to one of Connecticut's most notorious crimes while cross-examining the man.",
      "Dabate, 48, was convicted of murder and other charges in the fatal shooting of Connie Dabate, 39, at the couple's home in Ellington two days before Christmas in 2015 while their two young sons were in school. He's serving a 65-year prison sentence.",
      "Prosecutors said Dabate wanted his wife dead, in part, because he had a yearslong affair with another woman who was pregnant at the time of the killing and later gave birth to their child.",
      "Dabate staged a phony crime scene, including tying himself up loosely with zip ties and stabbing himself with a box cutter, and told police an unknown intruder in camouflage broke into their home, killed his wife and assaulted him, authorities said.",
      "State police said Dabate gave them a timeline of events that conflicted with data on his wife\u2019s Fitbit, which showed she was moving around for about an hour after the time Dabate said she was shot.",
      "Dabate testified in his defense and maintained his innocence, saying a large masked man with a voice like actor Vin Diesel was the killer.",
      "Part of Dabate's appeal questioned the reliability of the Fitbit evidence and whether the trial judge was wrong to have allowed it, but the Supreme Court upheld the data and its use.",
      "Dabate also accused Tolland State's Attorney Matthew Gedansky of multiple instances of impropriety, including Gedansky mentioning a notorious home invasion in Cheshire in 2007 while cross-examining Dabate. The home invaders killed a woman and her two daughters, ages 11 and 17, after terrorizing them for hours, while the woman's husband survived a vicious beating.",
      "Gedansky asked Dabate if he was trying to create a \u201clittle mini-Cheshire scene\u201d in his own home. The trial judge upheld an objection by Dabate's lawyer and asked Gedansky to rephrase the question, but Gedansky asked nearly the same exact question. The Supreme Court found Gedansky violated the judge's order to rephrase.",
      "\u201cIn referring to a \u2018mini Cheshire,\u2019 the prosecutor\u2019s question was unnecessarily inflammatory because it compared the defendant to other notorious offenders or infamous figures,\u201d Justice Joan Alexander wrote in the decision.",
      "Gedansky and Dabate's lawyer, Trent LaLima, did not immediately return email messages seeking comment Monday.",
      "The Supreme Court also found that Gedansky committed three other improprieties, including suggesting that the jury would have to be unintelligent or lazy to agree with the defense theory of the case.",
      "\u201cWe disapprove of the improprieties committed by the prosecutor during the trial of this case in strong and unqualified terms and expect our message to be taken with the utmost seriousness by prosecutors,\u201d the decision said.",
      "The court said it agreed with Dabate that \u201cthe prosecutor engaged in multiple acts of impropriety at trial that we consider troubling.\u201d",
      "Justices, however, said the state's case was very strong and Gedansky's missteps did not overshadow testimony by 130 witnesses and the 600 exhibits presented during the five-week trial."

      "Cox said that like many people in Utah, he grew up and raised his own children in a community that doesn\u2019t have fluoridated water \u2014 or what he called a \u201cnatural experiment.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou would think you would see drastically different outcomes with half the state not getting it. We haven\u2019t seen that,\u201d Cox said in a weekend interview with ABC4 in Salt Lake City. \u201cSo it\u2019s got to be a really high bar for me if we\u2019re going to require people to be medicated by their government.\u201d",
      "Already, some cities across the country have gotten rid of fluoride from their water, and other municipalities are considering doing the same. A few months ago, a federal judge ordered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate fluoride in drinking water because high levels could pose a risk to kids\u2019 intellectual development.",
      "A Utah teenager who urged lawmakers to pass the bill described suffering a medical emergency when the fluoride pump in Sandy, Utah, malfunctioned in 2019, releasing an excessive amount of the mineral into the drinking water. The fluoride sickened hundreds of residents and led many in Utah to push for its removal.",
      "It\u2019s rare to find high levels of fluoridation in water, according to the National Institutes of Health. The agency said it\u2019s \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d to get a toxic dose of fluoride from water with standard levels of the mineral.",
      "Kessler said the amounts of fluoride added to drinking water have been reduced over time and are below levels considered problematic.",
      "\u201cThe science proves that it is effective at reducing cavities with little to no risk of other problems,\u201d he said.",
      "He added that a ban in Utah could have a domino effect with other legislatures being encouraged to follow suit with fluoride bans in their states.",
      "Opponents warned it would disproportionately affect low-income residents who may rely on public drinking water having fluoride as their only source of preventative dental care. Low-income families may not be able to afford regular dentist visits or the fluoride tablets some people buy as a supplement in cities without fluoridation.",
      "Fluoridation is the most cost-effective way to prevent tooth decay on a large scale, said Lorna Koci, who chairs the Utah Oral Health Coalition.",
      "Utah in 2022 ranked 44th in the nation for the percentage of residents that receive fluoridated water, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About two in five Utah residents served by community water systems received fluoridated water.",
      "In February, the city council in Riverton, a Salt Lake City suburb, unanimously passed a resolution to remove fluoride from the city\u2019s public water systems. Voters in Brigham City, 59 miles (95 kilometers) north of the capital city, struck down by a large margin a measure in 2023 that would have removed the mineral from its public water supply.",
      "Out of the 484 Utah water systems that reported data to the CDC in 2024, only 66 fluoridated their water, an Associated Press analysis showed. The largest was the state\u2019s biggest city, Salt Lake City.",
      "Rodney Thornell, president of the Utah Dental Association, began practicing dentistry in a Salt Lake City suburb before the city added fluoride to its water. His adult patients who grew up locally continue to get lots of cavities but younger patients who grew up with fluoride in the water get fewer, he said.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re going to keep eating sugar, we need fluoride.\u201d Thornell said, noting that Utah residents consume more than the national average of candy and sugary drinks.",

      "If you\u2019re about to go to the gym, should you eat something beforehand",
      "If you listen to some self-proclaimed exercise experts on social media, they swear that working out on an empty stomach burns more fat.",
      "But it\u2019s a common misconception that exercising in a fasted state improves performance or burns more calories, said Abby Langer, a dietitian in Toronto.",
      "\u201cThe research shows that in terms of gains, it doesn\u2019t really make much of a difference,\u201d she said.",
      "Does that mean you should load up on protein and carbs right before a workout? No, that\u2019s not true either.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at when \u2014 and how \u2014 you should eat, before, after or even during a workout. (And remember, experts say what you eat is more important than when you eat.)",
      "The calories in food literally are energy, so you need them to fuel your body for a proper workout. Eating too much too soon beforehand, though, can be problematic.",
      "Exercising diverts blood from organs including the stomach to the muscles, said Langer, author of \u201cGood Food, Bad Diet.\u201d So exercising on a full stomach affects the digestive process, which could cause cramping or even make you feel sick.",
      "That\u2019s particularly the case with meals high in fat, protein or fiber, which take longer to digest than carbohydrates. Langer recommends eating a high ratio of carbs beforehand and waiting two to three hours before intense exercise.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t want to eat a big steak an hour before you play hockey,\u201d she said.",
      "If you exercise first thing in the morning or before dinner, it\u2019s OK to have a carb-rich snack like a banana with peanut butter or yogurt with fruit beforehand. It will give you the energy to perform well, and you can fuel up afterward with a full meal.",
      "That steak may serve you better afterward because that\u2019s when a higher ratio of protein is easier to digest, said Krista Austin, a physiologist in Colorado Springs.",
      "Austin said if it will be an hour or longer before you can have a full meal, it\u2019s better to have a high-protein snack in the meantime to help curb your appetite. The reason has little to do with muscle recovery or nutrient absorption: Rather, people who are too hungry make poor dietary choices.",
      "\u201cA lot of people get very hungry about an hour after exercise, and you don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d said Austin, author of \u201cPerformance Nutrition: Applying the Science of Nutrient Timing.\u201d \u201cYou want to catch it early, or you go and overeat.\u201d",
      "But it\u2019s another myth that you need to grab a protein shake within minutes of finishing to build the biggest muscles, Langer said.",
      "Many exercise enthusiasts point to what\u2019s known as an \u201canabolic window\u201d of about an hour within exercising that the body is primed to repair muscle. For the average person, you have a much longer window, and nutrient timing is less important than making sure you consume some protein at every meal, Langer said. The body needs a continuous supply of amino acids like protein for muscle repair and maintenance, she said, which means about 25 to 30 grams at every meal, depending on various factors.",
      "\u201cPrioritizing that will help with goals, either muscle building, satiety, weight loss, all of that,\u201d Langer said.",
      "Most people who are eating enough throughout the day don\u2019t need anything during a workout. Langer and Austin said the threshold is about an hour of intense exercise. Longer than that \u2014 say you're training for a marathon \u2014 and you can benefit from a carb-rich snack in the middle.",
      "Instead of focusing on when to eat, Austin said to focus on what and how much. She cautioned against overcomplicating the topic and recommended following the USDA\u2019s My Plate recommendations for a balanced diet.",
      "\u201cThe biggest thing we need to teach people is that nutrition is simple,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe you need to stop focusing on the concept of nutrient timing and just make sure that you\u2019re consistently eating throughout the day and focus on health.\u201d",

      "Opening the center on International Women's Day across from the legislature was a symbolic challenge to authorities in the traditionally Roman Catholic nation, which has one of Europe's most restrictive laws.",
      "A small but loud group of protesters stood outside the center as activists gathered inside for its inauguration. The activists had private security guards, while police also separated the protesters from those inside.",
      "Activists with the group Abortion Dream Team say it is the first stationary abortion center in Poland. It is meant to offer support to women who prefer not to have abortions alone in their bathrooms at home.",
      "They also say they want to put pressure on politicians and to destigmatize abortion in a society where they say one in four women have had the procedure but it remains a taboo topic.",
      "The country's centrist prime minister, Donald Tusk, came to power in an election in 2023 in which he vowed to liberalize the country's abortion law. But the coalition he leads spans a broad ideological divide, with lawmakers on the left who want to legalize abortion and conservatives strongly opposed.",

      "LA MALBAIE, Canada -- Top diplomats from the Group of 7 industrialized democracies held a first day of talks in Canada on Thursday as U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s trade and foreign policies have thrown the bloc\u2019s once solid unity into disarray. Trump then made new comments antagonizing Secretary of State Marco Rubio's Canadian hosts.",
      "The two-day meeting opened just after Trump threatened to impose 200% tariffs on European wine and other alcohol if the European Union doesn\u2019t back down from retaliating against U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs with a levy on American whiskey.",
      "The escalating trade war added to uncertainty over relations between the U.S. and its closest allies, which have already been strained by Trump\u2019s position on Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.",
      "It also meant that Rubio, on his first official trip to Canada and his first to a G7 event, was likely to hear a litany of complaints as he met with the foreign ministers of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan.",
      "All of them have been angered by the new American president\u2019s policies, and they smiled stiffly in frigid temperatures as they posed for a group photo at a snowy resort in La Malbaie, Quebec, on the St. Lawrence River.",
      "\u201cPeace and stability is at the top of our agenda, and I look forward to discussing how we continue to support Ukraine in the face of Russia\u2019s illegal aggression,\u201d Canadian Foreign Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly said as she gaveled the meetings into session.",
      "Rubio had met earlier with Joly, arriving in Quebec late Wednesday just hours after Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs kicked in \u2014 prompting irate responses from the European Union and Canada. Neither Rubio nor Joly spoke, and neither the State Department nor the Canadian foreign ministry issued normally customary readouts of the discussion.",
      "In fact, there was little, if any, information to emerge about the closed-door discussions on Thursday that were punctuated by uncertainty over Joly's planned depature for Ottawa on Friday before the G7 meeting had been scheduled to close to attend soon-to-be new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's first Cabinet meeting.",
      "But, en route to Canada from Saudi Arabia, where he had won agreement from Ukraine for a 30-day ceasefire in the war, Rubio had dismissed suggestions that he would face an uncomfortable reception from this counterparts.",
      "Joly, however, had made it clear that Canada, at least, would not back down. Trump has arguably been most antagonistic toward Canada with persistent talk of it becoming the 51st U.S. state, additional tariffs and persistent insults against its leadership, much of which he repeated on Thursday in comments at the White House.",
      "Ahead of the talks, Joly had said she would use every meeting at the G7 to raise Trump's tariffs and coordinate a response. She also noted that Trump had continued to press \"his disrespectful 51st state rhetoric.\u201d",
      "For his part, Trump doubled down on the anti-Canada rhetoric during an Oval Office meeting on Thursday with NATO chief Mark Rutte. \u201cTo be honest with you, Canada only works as a state,\u201d Trump said before going on to say that he\u2019s not going to change his mind on the tariffs he\u2019s imposing on Canada. \u201cWe\u2019ve been ripped off for years,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to bend.\"",
      "Rubio had downplayed Trump's earlier comments, saying the president was only expressing what he thought would be a good idea. The G7 \"is not a meeting about how we\u2019re going to take over Canada,\u201d he said.",
      "German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said G7 nations should avoid panic and posted a message of support for Canada on X, featuring a photo of her and EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas. \u201cWe\u2019ve got your back, @melaniejoly,\u201d she wrote. \u201c#Canada #Solidarity\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have learned altogether in these shaky geopolitical times ... especially in moments when your heart is really beating, it\u2019s important to keep calm,\u201d Baerbock told reporters. She noted that the G7 has been \u201ca powerhouse \u2026 for freedom, for our common understanding of peace.\u201d",
      "On tariffs, Rubio said G7 partners should understand that these are a \u201cpolicy decision\u201d by Trump to protect American competitiveness.",
      "\u201cI think it is quite possible that we could do these things and at the same time deal in a constructive way with our allies and friends and partners on all the other issues that we work together on,\u201d Rubio had told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I expect out of the G7 and Canada.\u201d",
      "Asked if he expected a difficult reception from his counterparts, Rubio brushed the question aside: \u201cI don\u2019t know, should I be? I mean, they\u2019ve invited us to come. We intend to go. The alternative is to not go. I think that would actually make things worse, not better.\u201d",
      "The agenda for the G7 meeting included discussions on China and the Indo-Pacific; Ukraine and Europe; stability in the Americas; the Middle East; maritime security; Africa; and China, North Korea, Iran and Russia.",
      "Rubio and Trump's national security adviser, Mike Waltz, had been in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, earlier in the week securing a potentially huge win for the administration \u2014 a possible 30-day ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war, an issue that galvanized the G7 since even before the conflict began. Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff arrived Thursday in Russia for talks with officials on the proposal.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that he agrees in principle with the U.S. proposal but that the terms need to be worked out, emphasizing it should pave the way to lasting peace.",
      "\u201cSo the idea itself is correct, and we certainly support it,\u201d Putin said at a news conference in Moscow. \u201cBut there are issues that we need to discuss, and I think that we need to discuss it with our American colleagues and partners.\u201d",
      "There was no immediate comment from G7 officials to Putin's comments, although participants were expected to be cautiously optimistic.",
      "Still, Trump\u2019s apparent desire to draw Putin back into the fold \u2014 including saying he would like to see Russia rejoin the group to restore it to the G8 \u2014 continues to alarm G7 members. Russia was thrown out of the G8 after it seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.",
      "Among international groupings, the G7 \u2014 whose members, with the exception of Japan, are all NATO allies \u2014 had been the toughest on Russia.",

      "That worries trade unions, and many of Starmer\u2019s own lawmakers, who fear his aim of \u201creshaping the state\u201d will bring job losses and spending cuts.",

      "Starmer\u2019s center-left party won a landslide election victory in July, ending 14 years of Conservative government. But polls suggest support for his Labour government has plummeted since then, as public services creak under record demand and economic growth remains stubbornly low.",
      "Last month, the government said it would boost defense spending from the current 2.3% of GDP to 2.5% by 2027, a move that will cost billions. That makes it likely the government will announce tax increases or spending cuts, or both, in its spring budget statement on March 26.",
      "Part of the savings will come by trimming welfare benefits. The government says the changes, expected to be announced in detail next week, will help get more people back to work. But anti-poverty groups and advocates for the disabled worry they will cut support to some of society\u2019s most vulnerable people.",
      "Starmer also vowed to slash regulation and prune \u201cthe thicket of red tape,\u201d which he said is blocking new homes and infrastructure, and to ramp up AI use so that one in 10 civil servants is in a tech or digital role within five years.",
      "In a surprise move, he abolished NHS England, the arms-length public body that oversees the state-funded health system for England\u2019s 56 million people. Starmer said that will cut bureaucracy and make the system more efficient. It\u2019s also likely to see thousands of jobs eliminated.",
      "The media have dubbed Starmer\u2019s plans \u201cProject Chainsaw,\u201d a nickname that evokes Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Starmer\u2019s office rejected what it called \u201cthat juvenile characterization.\u201d",
      "Mike Clancy, general secretary of the Prospect union, urged the government \u201cto avoid the incendiary rhetoric and tactics we are seeing in the United States, and to be clear that reforms are about enhancing and not undermining the civil service.\u201d",
      "Soon Starmer will return to the international realm amid deep uncertainty over Ukraine\u2019s future as Washington pushes to end the war. His careful diplomacy has seen Starmer \u2014 alongside French President Emmanuel Macron \u2014 work to assemble a \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d to secure a future ceasefire, while striving to persuade Trump to maintain support for Kyiv.",
      "Starmer will convene leaders from around 25 countries for a conference call on Saturday to flesh out plans.",
      "He also said on Thursday that the futures of Ukraine and Britain were intertwined.",

      "Prosecutors said Lydia Mugambe made the Ugandan woman work as her maid and provide childcare for free.",
      "Mugambe, who is also a high court judge in Uganda, was studying for a doctorate in law at the University of Oxford when the offenses occurred.",
      "Prosecution lawyer Caroline Haughey told jurors during the trial that Mugambe \u201cexploited and abused\u201d the victim, deceiving her into coming to the U.K. and taking advantage of her lack of understanding of her rights.",
      "Mugambe, 49, denied the charges. Jurors at Oxford Crown Court convicted her on all four charges she faced, including an immigration offense, forcing someone to work and conspiracy to intimidate a witness.",
      "There were gasps from the public gallery as the verdicts were read out, and the court was cleared after Mugambe appeared unwell. She is due to be sentenced on May 2.",
      "According to her United Nations profile page, Mugambe was appointed to one of the global body\u2019s international courts in May 2023."

      "The Baloch Liberation Army, an outlawed group behind multiple deadly attacks in recent months, claimed responsibility for the attack that began Tuesday and ended Wednesday when troops killed all 33 insurgents in an operation that the military said resulted in no further passenger deaths. The train was heading from the Balochistan capital, Quetta, to the northern city of Peshawar when insurgents blew up the track, forcing nine coaches and the engine of the Jafer Express train to stop partially inside a tunnel.",

      "On Tuesday the TPLF faction seized Adigrat, the second-biggest town in Tigray, and appointed a new administrator, ousting the office-holder loyal to the interim government. On Wednesday night, it took control of Adi-Gudem, a town near the regional capital, Mekele. Several people in Adi-Gudem were injured when forces attempted to occupy a government building.",
      "The TPLF fought a brutal two-year war against federal forces which ended in November 2022 with the signing of a peace agreement and the formation of a TPLF-led interim government.

      "The center-right government\u2019s fall on Tuesday amid questions about the prime minister's conduct brought the worst bout of political instability since Portugal adopted a democratic system more than 50 years ago in the wake of the 1974 Carnation Revolution, which ended a four-decade dictatorship.",
      "Portugal, which has a population of around 10.6 million people, has had a series of minority governments in recent years as the traditional rivals for power, the center-right Social Democratic Party and the center-left Socialists, lost votes to growing smaller parties.",

      "Montenegro, who says he\u2019ll stand for reelection, has denied any wrongdoing. He said he placed control of the firm in the hands of his wife and children when he became Social Democratic leader in 2022 and has not been involved in its running.",

      "While many were happy to see an end to the Assad family\u2019s dictatorial rule of over 50 years in the war-torn country, religious and ethnic minorities have been skeptical of the new Islamist leaders and reluctant to allow Damascus under its new authorities to assert control of their areas.",
      "Abdulhamid Al-Awak, one of the seven members of the committee al-Sharaa tasked to draft the temporary constitution, told a press conference Thursday that it will maintain some previsions from the previous one, including the stipulation that the head of state has to be a Muslim, and Islamic law is the main source of jurisprudence.",
      "However, Al-Awak, a constitutional law expert who teaches at the Mardin Artuklu University in Turkey, also said the temporary constitution includes provisions that enshrine freedom of expression and the press. The constitution will \u201cbalance between social security and freedom\u201d during Syria's shaky political situation, he said.",
      "A new committee to draft a permanent constitution will be formed, but it is unclear if it will be more inclusive of Syria's political, religious, and ethnic groups.",

      "A key goal of the interim constitution was to give a timeline for the country\u2019s political transition out of its interim phase. In December, Al-Sharaa said it could take up to three years to rewrite Syria\u2019s constitution and up to five years to organize and hold elections.",

      "The peril and promise of Syria under interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa \u2014 the former leader of an Islamist insurgent group \u2014 were on dramatic display over the past week. After days of deadly sectarian violence, a diplomatic triumph united a powerful force in the country\u2019s northeast with the new national army.",
      "By Tuesday, it seemed as if Syria had made major steps toward quelling the tensions that erupted over the weekend. But analysts say the country still has a long way to go, and that the risks of sliding back into civil war, or partitioning the country along ethnic and sectarian lines, remain.",
      "The \u201cpath to rebuilding trust\u201d will require Syria's new leaders to do more to \u201cprotect lives and foster a sense of unity among all communities,\u201d said Ammar Kahf, executive director of Omran Center for Strategic Studies in Istanbul.",

      "Beginning last Thursday, clashes between government security forces and armed groups loyal to Assad spiraled into sectarian revenge attacks that killed hundreds of civilians, most of them Alawites, a minority sect to which Assad belongs.",
      "Government reinforcements eventually restored order, and calm appeared to hold by late Monday. That same day, al-Sharaa had signed a landmark pact under which Kurdish-led forces in the country\u2019s northeast would be merged with the new national army.",
      "The deal marked a major step toward unifying the disparate factions that had carved up Syria into de facto mini-states during its civil war. The civil war began in 2011 after the Assad government's brutal crackdown on massive anti-government protests.",
      "Most of the armed factions that fought to unseat Assad announced in January that they would join the national army. In practice, though, they have maintained their own leadership.",
      "\u201cThis is not a professional army,\u201d said Issam al-Reis, a military adviser with Etana, a Syrian research group. \u201cIn theory, there are plans to join the factions into an army and merge everybody together under the Ministry of Defense. But so far, in reality, on the ground, everybody is still under his own umbrella.\u201d",
      "On the other side, there are thousands of former soldiers from the disbanded Assad-era army who are now unemployed and \u201cvery easy targets\" for local or international actors interested in upsetting Syria's fragile stability, al-Reis said.",
      "The sectarian violence over the weekend was difficult to contain, analysts say, because the government had to turn to a patchwork of undisciplined factions \u2014 including armed civilians -- to combat pro-Assad militants who attacked security forces along the coast. Members of some of those factions launched bloody revenge attacks on Alawite civilians.",
      "The violence only reinforced the \u201csignificant challenge to the Syrian (government's) efforts to consolidate power,\u201d said Kahf, of the Omran Center for Strategic Studies.",
      "Unexpectedly, the violence appears to have expedited the deal to bring the Kurdish-led armed group controlling most of northeastern Syria, known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, under the umbrella of the national army.",
      "The agreement came about when it did because al-Sharaa \u201cneeded to achieve a diplomatic victory\" after the weekend violence damaged his image, said Ahmed Aba Zeid, a Syrian researcher. At the same time, the SDF calculated it could \u201cachieve greater gains if it gave Sharaa this gift at this time,\u201d he said.",
      "Under the agreement, border crossings, airports and oil fields in the northeast will also be brought under the central government\u2019s control by the end of the year. Many details still need to be ironed out \u2014 including who will manage prisons holding Islamic State fighters captured by SDF \u2014 but the agreement gives al-Sharaa a much-needed political boost.",

      "\u201cThis would not have happened if the Turks weren\u2019t willing to let it happen,\u201d according to a senior U.S. defense official who said Washington encouraged SDF to reach an agreement with Syria's leaders.

      "Although not written into the agreement, the official said Ankara had demanded assurances that the SDF would remove foreign fighters linked to the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, a Kurdish separatist group that had waged a decades-long insurgency in Turkey before recently announcing a ceasefire.",

      "Police Maj. Gen. Nicolas Torre provided details for the first time of Tuesday\u2019s 12-hour standoff at a Philippine air base before he and other police officers managed to bring the 79-year-old former leader onto a government-chartered jet that took him to The Hague, Netherlands, where he was detained by the global court on charges of crimes against humanity.",
      "Duterte was once feared for his brutal anti-crime crackdowns and reviled for his irreverence while in office \u2014 he called Pope Francis a \u201cson of a bitch\u201d at one time and said that U.S. President Barack Obama could \u201cgo to hell.\u201d Duterte\u2019s stunning reversal of fortune was celebrated by human rights groups as a historic triumph against state impunity everywhere.",

      "But Duterte, his family, lawyers and friends resisted and prevented the former leader from being brought to a Gulfstream G550 executive jet, according to Torre.",
      "The standoff lasted for about 12 hours, Torre said.",
      "\u201cIt was very tense,\u201d Torre told The Associated Press. \u201cOne of my officers sustained a head injury after being hit hard with a cellphone\u201d by Duterte\u2019s common-law wife \u201cand his daughter was cursing me with expletives, but I kept my cool.\"",

I can\u2019t do anything if I get arrested and jailed,\u201d he said in an expletives-laced speech.",

      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Taiwanese President William Lai Ching-te said Thursday tougher measures are needed to counter stepped-up Chinese infiltration, spying and other efforts to weaken the island's defenses and speed Beijing's goal of taking control of the self-governing island republic, a close U.S. partner.",
      "Lai cited a range of recent incidents involving China that fall into a \u201cgray area\u201d including psychological warfare short of open armed conflict.",
      "Beijing's efforts to \u201csubvert, obtain secrets, lure members of the armed forces and influence public opinion to lose confidence in our national defense require that we step up our legal safeguards to prevent and detect such incidents,\u201d Lai said at a news conference.",
      "Lai said proposed measures to counter China's moves included bringing back military trials for crimes such as spying and making it more difficult for residents from China and the Chinese territories of Hong Kong, and Macau to obtain Taiwanese identification, a task made more difficult by widespread intermarriage between Taiwanese and Chinese.",
      "Taiwan will also further limit contact with the island by individuals affiliated with the ruling Chinese Communist Party's United Front department aimed at using cultural products and personnel exchanges to push Beijing's line on unification.",
      "That followed a case last year when a student on such a delegation sponsored by a pro-unification Taiwanese group used deprecating language toward Taiwan, sparking public anger but with no legal ramifications.",
      "Lai's Democratic Progressive Party favors the island\u2019s continued de-facto independence from Beijing. China has refused almost all official contact with the DPP since Lai's predecessor, Tsai Ing-wen, was elected eight years ago.",
      "China regularly sends ships and planes into airspace and waters near the island in an effort to intimidate its 23 million people and wear down its armed forces and morale.",
      "Taiwan's government recently expelled the Chinese wife of a Taiwanese citizen after the woman repeatedly posted short clips on Chinese social media saying China would conquer Taiwan in half an hour and praising the Chinese leadership.",
      "Such acts are illegal under Taiwan's laws on aiding and abetting the enemy. The woman, who also held official Chinese titles as a consultant, can apply for residency again in five years.",
      "Other recent incidents have included Taiwanese artists and influencers living in China reposting statements from Chinese state media asserting Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan.",
      "Retired Taiwanese service members have also passed information about the island\u2019s weapons systems to Chinese agents and sought to recruit serving military personnel as spies.",
      "The Defense Ministry on Wednesday confirmed a case where a retired air force major claiming to be working for a U.S. think tank persuaded an air force air intercept controller to hand over classified files in exchange for payment. The retired major, surnamed Shih, delivered the documents to his handlers in China for about $45,000, of which he shared about $6,000 with the serving officer, surnamed Hsu.",
      "The leaked information related to Taiwan's domestically developed air-launched Hsiung Feng III anti-ship missiles and Taiwan's response to Chinese incursions into its air defense identification zone.",
      "The two sides separated by the 180-kilometer (110 mile) Taiwan Strait split amid civil war in 1949, and China continues to regard Taiwan as its own territory to be recovered by force if necessary. Lai's comments came on the 20th anniversary of China's passage of its Anti-Succession Act, which laid out conditions under which China would invade, including if the island declared formal independence or refused unification indefinitely.",
      "Taiwan's government says it is already independent for all intents and purposes, and therefore there is no need to make such a declaration, a view embraced by the vast majority of the electorate.",
      "Taiwan has been bulking up its defenses with new missiles and U.S. tanks and planes, along with self-made submarines. It also recently extended the period for mandatory national military service for all men from four months to one year."

      "In a report published on Thursday, U.N. health experts said Romania had the most measles infections, at more than 30,000, followed by Kazakhstan, which reported 28,147 people with measles.",
      "UNICEF said that about 40% of measles infections in Europe and Central Asia were in children under 5 and that more than half of all people sickened by measles had to be hospitalized. Measles is among the world\u2019s most infectious diseases and is spread by an airborne virus.",
      "Two doses of the measles vaccine is estimated to be 97% effective in preventing the disease, which typically infects the respiratory system and causes symptoms including fever, cough, runny nose and a rash. In serious cases, measles can cause pneumonia, encephalitis, dehydration and blindness.",
      "\u201cMeasles is back, and it\u2019s a wake-up call,\" Dr. Han Kluge, WHO\u2019s Europe director, said in a statement. \"Without high vaccination rates, there is no health security.\u201d",
      "WHO and UNICEF noted that in both Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, fewer than 70% and 50% of children in those countries respectively have been vaccinated against measles for at least the past five years. Scientists estimate that more than 95% of the population needs to be immunized to prevent outbreaks.",
      "After a drop in immunization coverage during the coronavirus pandemic, measles cases surged in 2023 and 2024, with vaccination rates in numerous countries still lower than what they were before COVID-19 hit. The U.N. said the number of measles cases across Europe made up one third of the approximately 359,521 infections last year.",
      "Concerns about the safety of the measles vaccine have persisted for decades, after British physician Dr. Andrew Wakefield and colleagues published a paper in 1998 \u2014 which has long since been retracted \u2014 linking the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine to autism. No evidence for any causal link has ever been found and Wakefield had his license to practise medicine in the U.K. revoked.",

      "BUCHAREST, Romania -- Controversial Romanian politician Diana Sosoaca, who was barred by a top court from entering last year\u2019s annulled presidential election, filed her candidacy on Thursday in an unlikely bid to enter the May rerun.",
      "The 49-year-old former lawyer and Member of the European Parliament of the far-right nationalist S.O.S. Romania party filed her candidacy at the Central Election Bureau in the capital, Bucharest. The bureau has 48 hours to register or reject. Rejections can be appealed within 24 hours.",
      "The Constitutional Court, or CCR, barred the pro-Russia politician from entering last year\u2019s race, arguing that her public discourse, including opposition to Romania \u2019s European Union and NATO memberships, made her unfit to uphold the constitutional obligations of the presidency.",
      "\u201cAfter analyzing the whole situation with our lawyers, they are no longer allowed to ban me because you cannot ban the same candidate twice for the same reasons,\u201d Sosoaca, wearing a pair of white boxing gloves, told a news conference Thursday.",

      "The court\u2019s decision last year drew strong criticism from some civil rights groups and politicians, who denounced it as undermining democracy or politically motivated.",
      "The first round of the rerun is scheduled for May 4. If no candidate wins more than 50% of the ballots, a runoff will follow on May 18. The deadline for presidential candidacy applications is March 15 at midnight.",
      "Romania\u2019s president serves a five-year term and has significant decision-making powers in areas such as national security, foreign policy and judicial appointments.",
      "Sosoaca\u2019s candidacy marks the latest twist in a turbulent presidential election following the CCR\u2019s decision last year to annul the election two days before a Dec. 8 runoff. The court made that decision after allegations emerged of electoral violations and claims that Russia had run a coordinated online campaign to promote Calin Georgescu, who ran as an independent. Moscow has denied meddling in the election.",
      "It also comes two days after the same court unanimously rejected an appeal by the far-right Georgescu, who sought to overturn a ban on his candidacy to participate in the rerun after the Central Election Bureau refused to register him on Sunday.",
      "Romania\u2019s decision to annul the election, and this week\u2019s ban on Georgescu\u2019s candidacy, has been strongly criticized by U.S. Vice President JD Vance, Elon Musk and Moscow.",
      "Romania\u2019s far-right, which holds about a third of seats in the country's legislature, is now scrambling to replace Georgescu\u2019s candidacy.",
      "After a meeting with Georgescu, George Simion, the 38-year-old leader of the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, and Anamaria Gavrila, the leader of the right-wing populist Party of Young People, both stated on Wednesday that they intend to file their presidential bids in the coming days.",
      "\u201cWe have to (collect) until Friday 200,000 signatures, but things are moving like never before, incredible mobilization. People are waiting in queues to sign,\u201d Simion, who came fourth in last year\u2019s first-round vote with 13.8% of the ballots, told the AP on Thursday.",
      "Simion, who is currently under criminal investigation for inciting violence during a protest after Georgescu was barred from running, says he\u2019s concerned his bid could be blocked. \u201cThe real battle is that they don\u2019t ban me like they did with Georgescu and Sosoaca,\u201d he added. He has denied any wrongdoing and claimed it is politically motivated.",
      "Gavrila said on Wednesday that if both of their candidacies are validated, one of them will step down from running. \u201cWe must give this sovereigntist movement every possible chance,\u201d she said.",
      "Elena Lasconi, leader of the Save Romania Union party, who was set to face Georgescu in the scheduled runoff last year, is also expected to stand as a candidate. She has described the current political crisis as \u201ca turning point\u201d for Romania.",
      "Victor Ponta, a former prime minister between 2012-2015 and former leader of Romania\u2019s leftist Social Democratic Party, filed his bid on Wednesday on a \u201cRomania First\u201d ticket.",

      "However, the occupants of the camp include veterans of a dreaded paramilitary unit that committed war crimes during the wars in the Balkans in the 1990s.

      "Initially, the protests began as sporadic demonstrations seeking accountability for the Novi Sad tragedy. However, they rapidly evolved into a nationwide movement addressing broader issues such as demands for major democratic reforms.",
      "The movement has garnered extensive support from various segments of Serbian society.",
      "Vucic has tried to ease the pressure by sacrificing the prime minister, who resigned in December along with the government. He put forward draft legislation on university education, while 16 people were charged over the disaster in Novi Sad.",
      "At the same time he has described the protests as a ploy organized in the West to oust him from power. Vucic sought and obtained support from Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin while cracking down on liberal rights groups at home.",
      "The rally is open-ended and may continue after Saturday, and student organizers say there may be further protests to come.",
      "\"We are not taking the final steps \u2014 we are making tectonic changes. If our demands are not met, we will remain on the streets, in blockades, in the fight until justice is served,\u201d they said on Instagram.",
      "Similar student-led rallies already have been held in Novi Sad, the central city of Kragujevac and Nis, in the country\u2019s south, drawing tens of thousands of people and lasting for a day or longer.",
      "Thousands of people from all over Serbia are expected to converge on Belgrade by Saturday. Already, hundreds of students have begun marching on the capital from various directions, while some are also cycling.",
      "The citizens of Belgrade, a city of some two million people, also are likely to swarm the streets in huge numbers as support for the student-led protests has persisted despite Vucic\u2019s campaign against them.",
      "The gathering on Saturday could easily turn into the biggest rally ever in the troubled Balkan nation, which has a long history of anti-government demonstrations.",

      "GENEVA -- United Nations-backed human rights experts on Thursday accused Israel of \u201cthe systematic use of sexual, reproductive and other gender-based violence\u201d in its war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",
      "The allegations came in one of the most extensive reports of its kind on the issue since Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel ignited the war.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lashed out at the Human Rights Council, a U.N.-backed body that commissioned the team of independent experts, as an \u201canti-Israel circus\u201d that \u201chas long been exposed as an antisemitic, rotten, terrorist-supporting, and irrelevant body.\u201d His statement did not address the findings themselves.",
      "The findings by the Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which seeks to document in minute detail the allegations and evidence of crimes to bolster accountability for perpetrators, could be used by prosecutors at the International Criminal Court or in other jurisdictions to try to bring justice to victims and their relatives.",
      "In its report released Thursday, the commission examined the widespread destruction of Gaza, the use of heavy explosives in civilian areas and Israeli attacks on hospitals and health facilities. It said all three led to \u201cdisproportionate violence against women and children.\u201d",
      "The commission documented a range of violations perpetrated against Palestinian women, men, girls and boys and accused Israeli security forces of rape and sexual violence against Palestinian detainees. Israel denies any systematic abuse of prisoners and says it takes action when there are violations.",
      "\u201cOur report finds that Israel has increasingly employed sexual, reproductive, and other forms of gender-based violence against Palestinians as part of a broader effort to undermine their right to self-determination,\" Chris Sidoti, a member of the commission, told reporters in Geneva.",
      "Israel\u2019s mission in Geneva rejected the allegations and accused the commission of relying on \u201csecond-hand, single, uncorroborated sources.\u201d Since the commission was set up in 2021 \u2014 long before the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel \u2014 Israel has refused to cooperate with it, accusing the investigative team and the council of bias.",
      "Commission member Sidoti said the report \"also concludes that Israel has carried out genocidal acts through the systematic destruction of sexual and reproductive health care facilities.\u201d",
      "The commission stopped short of accusing Israel of genocide, as some advocacy groups and other rights experts have. Israel, which was established in the wake of the Nazi Holocaust and is home to many survivors and their families, has vigorously denied such allegations.",
      "Israel says it took extraordinary measures to avoid harming civilians in the 15-month war, which has been paused by a fragile ceasefire. It blames civilian deaths and destruction on Hamas because the militants operate in residential areas. Israeli forces carried out a number of raids on hospitals, accusing Hamas of using them for military purposes, allegations denied by Palestinian health officials.",
      "The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages.",
      "Israeli authorities, citing eyewitness accounts and other evidence, have accused Hamas-led militants of widespread rape and sexual violence. Israeli experts who have treated former hostages say some were subjected to physical and sexual abuse in captivity.",
      "A U.N. envoy last year reported \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to believe such allegations.",
      "Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were combatants.",
      "On Tuesday and Wednesday, the commission held public hearings with victims, lawyers, advocacy groups and others whose accounts were included in the report.",
      "The commission was not considering allegations of sexual, gender-based and other violence committed against Israelis during the Oct. 7 attack or against hostages in Gaza, but reported on the issue last year.",

      "The interim government, which came to power in August after the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in a mass uprising in Bangladesh, is hopeful that the visit will strengthen international efforts to mobilize aid for the Rohingya refugees and attract new global attention to the Rohingya crisis.",

      "Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya have lived in Bangladesh for decades and about 70,000 crossed the border from Myanmar in 2024. During fighting with the military junta, the opposition force known as the Arakan Army effectively took over the Rakhine state where Rohingya were displaced and took shelter in Bangladesh.",
      "Bangladesh says repatriation of the refugees to Myanmar, which has been accused in an international court of genocide against Rohingya, is the ultimate solution of the crisis, but complexities over verification and other diplomatic and political issues have made the future of the refugees bleak."

      "BEIJING -- U.S. President Donald Trump threw a curve ball at China by linking the fentanyl issue to his tariffs on imports. The Chinese government is swinging back.",
      "First it issued a report detailing its efforts to control the illegal trade in fentanyl, specifically the ingredients for the opioid that are made in China. Then, the Chinese foreign minister blasted the U.S. for responding to Beijing's goodwill with tariffs. And this week, Chinese officials expressed their indignation at a rare background briefing with journalists.",
      "\u201cIn the spirit of humanity, China assisted the U.S. in various ways,\u201d Foreign Minister Wang Yi told journalists last week in an annual appearance before the media. \"The U.S. should not meet good with evil or even impose arbitrary tariffs. No responsible major country should do that.\u201d",
      "Trump cited the fentanyl issue as the reason for imposing a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports in early February, on top of any existing duties. He doubled that to 20% earlier this month. He also has cited fentanyl, along with other reasons, for imposing tariffs on Canada and Mexico.",
      "In his executive order on the first 10% tariff, Trump accused China of subsidizing chemical companies to export fentanyl and related \u201cprecursor chemicals\u201d and of providing a safe haven for Chinese criminal organizations that launder the revenues from the opioid trade.",
      "It's not unusual for the Chinese government to subsidize industries, and the precursor chemicals are also used to make legal painkillers. But some of the production finds it way to Mexican drug cartels who make fentanyl and send it to the United States.",
      "\u201cDespite multiple attempts to resolve this crisis at its root source through bilateral dialogue, PRC officials have failed to follow through with the decisive actions needed to stem the flow of precursor chemicals to known criminal cartels,\u201d the statement said, referring to China by the acronym for the People\u2019s Republic of China, its official name.",
      "The Chinese government hit back both times Trump imposed tariffs with its own duties on selected U.S. products and other measures aimed at American companies. Analysts have described the response as a measured one designed to try to avoid an escalation of the trade war, which could deal a blow to an already sluggish Chinese economy.",
      "The government's report on its fentanyl-related actions said that China and the U.S. have held multiple high-level meetings since early last year to promote cooperation, and that its Narcotics Control Bureau holds regular exchanges with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency.",
      "China is committed to cooperation, the report said, \u201cbut firmly opposes the U.S. imposition of unlawful sanctions and unreasonable pressure on China on the pretext of responding to fentanyl-related issues.\"",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, cooperation on fentanyl was relaunched in early 2024 after falling victim to geopolitics in 2022. In August of that year, a visit to Taiwan by a top U.S. legislator, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, angered China, and the government responded by cutting off talks on a range of issues including drug control.",
      "A rapprochement in late 2023, negotiated over several months, led to a meeting on fentanyl in January of last year. Drug enforcement, like climate, was held up as an area where the two countries could cooperate despite growing differences and their military, economic and technological competition.",
      "Now Trump, back in the White House after a four-year hiatus, is trying to shift the playing field in the U.S.-China relationship. So far, China has indicated it won't blink.",
      "\u201cIf the American side goes further down this wrong path, we will fight to the end,\u201d Commerce Minister Wang Wentao said last week.",

      "While Congress pushed ahead last year with adding 10 new daily flights to Washington, D.C.\u2019s Reagan National Airport, many looked past concerns about dangers in the congested skies over the nation's capital.",
      "Squeezing in more flights would only increase the risks, said Virginia\u2019s two senators, who called a near miss between two planes on a runway last April a \u201cflashing red warning light.\u201d",
      "What wasn\u2019t publicly known at the time \u2014 and didn\u2019t surface until this week during the investigation into the January midair collision between an airliner and military helicopter that killed 67 people \u2014 was that close calls at the airport were far more frequent than travelers and aviation experts knew.",
      "Now, safety experts and family members who lost loved ones in the Jan. 29 crash are asking why no one acted in the face of what appeared to be a looming disaster.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board said airplane pilots were alerted to take evasive action to avoid hitting helicopters at least once a month from 2011 through 2024, citing data compiled by the Federal Aviation Administration, and that there were 85 near misses when aircraft were within a few hundred feet (meters) of each other during recent years.",
      "\u201cHow does that happen in this day and age and somebody doesn\u2019t do something about it?\u201d asked Doug Lane, whose wife, Christine Conrad Lane, and their 16-year-old son, Spencer, died in the crash.",
      "Pilots have long worried about the congested and complex airspace around the airport near the heart of the capital, where flights must maneuver around military aircraft and restricted areas. It was no secret there had been previous close calls, but the numbers found by the NTSB were alarming.",
      "\u201cWhy someone was not paying attention to those numbers and those events are questions yet to be answered,\u201d said James Hall, a former NTSB chair during the Clinton administration.",
      "\u201cWhat not to do is to ignore that many incidents,\u201d he said.",
      "FAA officials have not yet addressed whether they knew there were so many encounters between planes and helicopters at Reagan National. Messages seeking comment were not immediately returned Thursday.",
      "Current NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who oversees the FAA, both said they were angry that the number of close calls were not recognized earlier by the FAA.",
      "\u201cIf someone was paying attention, someone was on the job, they would have seen this,\u201d Duffy said. He also announced he will move forward with banning some helicopter flights around the airport, a move that was temporarily made after the crash.",
      "Safety advocate Mary Schiavo, a former inspector general of the U.S. Transportation Department, said that while there was plenty of blame to go around for the midair collision, the FAA was shockingly complacent.",
      "\u201cThey literally wait for a disaster,\u201d she said. \u201dI can\u2019t even fathom how the families of those lost in this crash can even deal with this. I mean this would be so maddening to hear.\u201d",
      "The crowded airspace around Washington drew attention last year when Congress debated an aviation safety bill that allowed 10 more flights a day at Reagan National, despite strong objections from Virginia\u2019s Democratic senators, Tim Kaine and Mark Warner.",
      "Kaine, during a speech on the Senate floor, didn't mention specific concerns about encounters between airliners and helicopters or cite any statistics, but he did say the congestion was \u201ca problem waiting to happen.\u201d",
      "While Congress did OK the extra flights, they had not started as of the deadly January collision.",
      "The FAA limits arrival and departure slots at three of the nation\u2019s busiest airports, where demand exceeds the airport\u2019s capacity: Reagan National and New York City's LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy International airports.",
      "But Congress has a history of directing the FAA to add slots at Reagan, even though Washington\u2019s other international airport, Dulles, has capacity to handle them. Reagan is closer to the capital and most federal departments and therefore more convenient, particularly for lawmakers.",
      "Mike McCormick, coordinator of the Air Traffic Management program at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, said the congestion at Reagan National clearly contributed to the midair collision because the American Airlines jetliner, which was on a newly added route from Wichita, Kansas, was diverted to a different runway closer to the helicopter flights.",

      "Donatella Versace has been replaced as creative director of the fashion house founded by her late brother Gianni Versace, assuming the new role of chief brand ambassador, Versace\u2019s U.S. owner Capri Holdings announced on Thursday",
      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Donatella Versace has been replaced as creative director of the fashion house founded by her late brother Gianni Versace, assuming the new role of chief brand ambassador, Versace\u2019s U.S. owner Capri Holdings announced on Thursday.",
      "Versace will be replaced by Dario Vitale, who most recently was design director at the Miu Miu brand owned by the Prada Group. His appointment is effective on April 1.",
      "The creative shift comes amid speculation that the Prada Group is in talks to buy Versace from Capri Holdings, which paid 2 billion euros (currently $2.2 billion) for the fashion house in 2018. The U.S. group also owns Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo.",
      "Miuccia Prada acknowledged interest in the brand on the sidelines of Milan Fashion Week last month, while Versace made no comment at what was to be her last runway show. Versace, 69, took over as creative director in 1997, after her brother\u2019s murder in Miami.",
      "Capri Holding\u2019s statement made no mention of any plans to sell Versace, but the arrival of a designer from Miu Miu is only likely to fuel speculation of a possible deal.",
      "Versace CEO John D. Idol said in a statement that the creative shift was \u201cpart of a thoughtful succession plan for Versace.\u201d He called Vitale \u201ca strong leader,\u2019\u2019 and expressed confidence that \u201chis talent and vision will be instrumental to Versace\u2019s future growth.\u201d",
      "As chief brand ambassador, Versace \u201cwill continue to champion the Versace brand and its values,\u2019\u2019 Idol said.",
      "Versace said she was \u201cthrilled\u201d as a champion of the next generation of designers that Vitale would join Versace and that she was \u201cexcited'' to see the brand her brother founded in 1978 \"through new eyes.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt has been the greatest honor of my life to carry on my brother Gianni\u2019s legacy. He was the true genius, but I hope to have some of his spirit and tenacity,\u2019\u2019 she said in a statement. \u201cIn my new role as chief brand ambassador, I will remain Versace\u2019s most passionate supporter. Versace is in my DNA and always in my heart.\u2019\u2019",
      "Versace represented 20% of Capri Holdings 2024 revenue of 5.2 billion euros. Capri recently laid out strategic plans to rebalance the Versace portfolio to return the brand to its more daring roots, increase sales of accessories and win back entry-level consumers put off by a post-pandemic focus on higher net-worth clients."

      "Discount carrier Spirit Airlines has emerged from bankruptcy protection",
      "NEW YORK -- Discount carrier Spirit Airlines has emerged from bankruptcy protection.",
      "The budget airline \u2014 known for its no-frills, low-cost flights on a fleet of yellow planes \u2014 said Wednesday that its parent, Spirit Aviation Holdings, exited Chapter 11 after finalizing debt restructuring. The reorganization plan, which received the court greenlight last month, aims to bring the carrier back to profitability and boost resources to compete with rivals.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re emerging as a stronger and more focused airline,\u201d CEO Ted Christie, who will continue to lead Spirit post-bankruptcy, said in a statement.",
      "The restructuring deal allows Spirit to convert $795 million of its debt into equity. The company says it's also received a $350 million equity investment from existing investors to aid future operations.",
      "Spirit filed for bankruptcy back in November, following years of struggles and mounting debt as it failed to bounce back from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Florida carrier was particularly hit hard by rising operating expenses and stiffer competition. By the time of its Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.",
      "Whether Spirit will continue as a standalone airline has also been up in the air, although takeover attempts from budget rivals like JetBlue and Frontier have proven to be unsuccessful before and during the bankruptcy process. Spirit rejected a third bid from Frontier last month.",
      "While future merger proposals may not be entirely off the table, Spirit signaled Wednesday that it would continue to focus its own growth and offerings. Christie noted that the airline would be \"moving forward with our strategy to redefine low-fare travel with our new, high-value travel options.\u201d",
      "In an evolution from its budget-exclusive roots, Spirit is attempting to tap into the growing market for more upscale travel. It is now offering flight options with tiered prices, the higher-priced tickets coming with more amenities. Last year, months before filing for Chapter 11, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks.",
      "In a message sent to Spirit customers Wednesday, Christie continued to point those four travel options from the airline, which he said \u201clet you choose how you want to fly.\"",
      "Wednesday's announcement also noted plans to trade shares publicly again, although not immediately. Shares of Spirit previously issued by Spirit Airlines Inc. was canceled upon its exit from bankruptcy \u2014 but it expects to re-list shares, newly-issued under new owners, \u201cas soon as reasonably practicable.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile \u2014 between wider economic turmoil, high-profile plane crashes and other consumer uncertainty \u2014 major airlines have issued warnings in recent days about falling demand. Carriers like Delta, Southwest, American have all recently downgraded revenue outlooks for the first quarter.",

      "TOKYO -- Japanese automaker Nissan's chief executive, Makoto Uchida, is stepping down after the company reported dismal financial results.",
      "Nissan Motor Corp. said in a statement Tuesday that Ivan Espinosa, who is now the company\u2019s chief planning officer, will take Uchida\u2019s place, effective April 1.",
      "Espinosa, who joined Nissan in 2003, has spent much of his Nissan career in Mexico and Southeast Asia, overseeing product planning including the drive toward electric vehicles.",
      "\u201cI sincerely believe that Nissan has so much more potential than what we're seeing today,\u201d Espinosa told reporters, while stressing that he needs time to come up with details for a turnaround.",
      "He stressed his love for Nissan, noting he has developed a deep understanding of what makes the company unique and valuable.",
      "Nissan said the company leadership needed to be \u201crenewed\u201d to achieve long-term growth. Uchida, who remains as a director, expressed confidence in Espinosa as \u201ca real car guy,\u201d and stressed he was handing over the baton of leadership to better unify company ranks.",
      "\u201cI am confident that Nissan will definitely make a comeback,\u201d he said, appearing at the hastily called news conference with Espinosa.",
      "Speculation about Uchida's future was rife after he called off talks last month with Japanese rival Honda Motor Co., announced late last year, to set up a joint holding company to integrate its businesses. At the time, he told reporters the focus of the talks had changed to making Nissan into a Honda subsidiary, which he denounced as unacceptable.",
      "He also said their strategic partnership to realize synergies on specific projects like electric vehicles and other research will continue.",
      "Nissan is projecting a loss of 80 billion yen ($540 million) for the full fiscal year through the end of this month.",

      "During Uchida\u2019s more than five years at Nissan\u2019s helm, sales faltered, including in key markets like the U.S. and China. Uchida also earlier announced the company was slashing 9,000 jobs.",
      "It\u2019s a sad turn for the maker of the Z sportscar, loved by auto buffs around the world, and the Leaf electric car, a pioneer in that sector that launched in 2010.",
      "Uchida joined Nissan in 2003, job-hopping from major Japanese trading company Nissho Iwai, and worked with Nissan\u2019s alliance partner Renault SA of France before overseeing Nissan\u2019s China operations.",
      "Nissan was rescued from near bankruptcy by Renault in 1999. In 2018, Carlos Ghosn, the former superstar executive sent in by Renault, was arrested by Japanese authorities on various financial misconduct charges, including under-reporting his compensation. He later fled Japan for Lebanon.",
      "Nissan's tarnished corporate image after the Ghosn fiasco was a major challenge, Nishida said. So were the COVID-19 pandemic and broader shifts in the auto industry.",
      "Apart from Uchida's departure as chief executive, Nissan announced other sweeping managerial changes, including giving an expanded role to Guillaume Cartier, its chief performance officer, in global marketing and customer experience.",
      "Eiichi Akashi, corporate vice president of the Vehicle Planning and Vehicle Component Engineering Division, was named chief technology officer, succeeding Kunio Nakaguro.",
      "Teiji Hirata, a corporate vice president, will become chief \u201cmonozukuri\u201d officer and executive officer, responsible for manufacturing and supply chain management, replacing Hideyuki Sakamoto.",

      "Muto said Monday in Washington that Japan, which contributes to the U.S. economy by heavily investing and creating jobs in the United States, \u201cshould not be subject to\u201d 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum and auto exports to America.",
      "His meetings with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett came just two days before the steel and aluminum tariffs are due to take effect. President Donald Trump has also said a possible 25% tariff on imported foreign autos could take effect in early April.",
      "Muto said the U.S. officials acknowledged Japanese contributions and agreed to continue talks, but did not approve his request for Japan's exemption from the steep import duties.",
      "\u201cWe did not receive a response that Japan will be exempt,\u201d Muto told reporters. \u201cWe must continue to assert our position.\u201d",
      "As Trump's tariff threats have triggered tensions and vows of retaliation from Canada, Mexico and China, Japan has been working to firm up ties with other countries.",
      "Last week, the foreign and trade ministers from Japan and Britain gathered in Tokyo for their first \u201ctwo-plus-two\u201d economic dialogue. They agreed to stand up for \u201cfair, rules-based international trade,\u201d though nobody directly mentioned Trump.",
      "Japan depends heavily on exports and the auto tariffs would hurt, because vehicles are its biggest export and the United States is their top destination.",
      "\u201cClearly companies in Japan are very concerned,\u201d said Rintaro Nishimura, political analyst and associate at Japan Practice of The Asia Group. \u201cObviously the auto is the crown jewel for Japan, especially in the context of these tariffs.\" He says they are concerned also because the Trump administration is carrying it out in just two months after taking office.",
      "Trump also has criticized Japan\u2019s contributions to the two countries\u2019 mutual defense arrangements, adding to tensions with Tokyo.",
      "Muto said the two sides agreed to keep discussing to find ways to establish a \u201cwin-win\u201d relationship that would serve national interests of both countries.",
      "The two sides also discussed energy cooperation, including joint development of liquefied natural gas reserves in Alaska, which Trump and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba agreed on during Ishiba's visit to the White House in February.",

      "ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- The Tampa Bay Rays on Thursday withdrew from a $1.3 billion ballpark project, citing hurricanes and delays that likely will drive up the proposal's cost.",
      "The team issued a statement by principal owner Stuart Sternberg saying that \u201ca series of events\u201d in October, which included severe damage to the existing Tropicana Field and financing delays, led to what he called \u201cthis difficult decision.\u201d",
      "\u201cAfter careful deliberation, we have concluded we cannot move forward with the new ballpark and development project at this moment,\u201d Sternberg said.",
      "Displaced from the Trop in St. Petersburg, the Rays are set to play this season's home games across Tampa Bay at the New York Yankees' spring training home, 11,000-seat Steinbrenner Field. Meanwhile, repairs are envisioned to the Trop, including replacing its roof shredded by Hurricane Milton, that would have it ready for the 2026 season.",
      "Under their current contract with the city of St. Petersburg, the Rays would play three more seasons at their existing ballpark after it is repaired. Beyond that, the team\u2019s future in the Tampa Bay area is uncertain. MLB and the Rays could evaluate attendance and fan interest during the team's season in Tampa at Steinbrenner Field as they consider alternate sites.",
      "\u201cThe City of St. Petersburg is currently advancing plans to restore Tropicana Field for the 2026 season,\u201d Sternberg said. \u201cWe are thankful for their efforts and are excited to return to our home field next spring.\u201d",
      "The proposed 30,000-seat stadium is a signature piece of a broader $6.5 billion revitalization project known as the Historic Gas Plant District, which refers to a predominantly Black neighborhood that was forced out by construction of the Trop and an interstate highway spur.",
      "Supporters say the development would transform an 86-acre (34-hectare) tract in the city\u2019s downtown, with plans for a Black history museum, affordable housing, entertainment venues, plus office and retail space \u2014 and the promise of thousands of jobs.",
      "That broader project, counting on the Rays ballpark to be an anchor, is also in limbo with this decision.",

      "But it said findings that \u201craised additional suspicions of manipulation\u201d led to the suspensions of Pederson, Sundal and Johansson, who will not be able to take part in any events organized by FIS or national ski associations.",
      "\u201cThe rules are quite clear. The rules are made by all the ski family,\" FIS secretary general Michel Vion told a news conference in Oslo where a World Cup event started on Thursday. \"We know exactly the situation and I heard (it said) that, \u2018Yeah, but ski jumping is special. They (are always) on the limit, we can play ...\u2019",
      "\u201cNo, there\u2019s no play. There\u2019s no game here. It\u2019s only rules.\u201d",
      "It is not known how widespread the practice of manipulating pre-approved suits is within ski jumping.",
      "Lindvik and Forfang said they knew nothing about deliberately altered equipment, but their coach Magnus Brevig and equipment manager Adrian Livelten confessed and were stood down from their jobs.",
      "The investigation will be made by the FIS independent ethics and compliance office.",
      "\u201cWe are all aware that this is not the best moment for ski jumping, but I think this is the way that we want to go,\u201d FIS race director of ski jumping Sandro Pertile said. \"In this case we have, we are into an intentional manipulation.",
      "\u201cWe cannot communicate all the details but I think that we are on a good way to clarify the topic.\u201d",
      "FIS said all suits would be checked at the event in Oslo.",

      "Minnesota fired coach Ben Johnson after four years of repeatedly rebuilding rosters at his alma mater",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- MINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Minnesota fired coach Ben Johnson on Thursday after four years of repeatedly rebuilding rosters at his alma mater without coming close to an NCAA Tournament appearance.",
      "It was a fleeting accomplishment for a program that has fallen behind in the rugged and expanded Big Ten.",
      "Johnson had two seasons remaining on his contract, which calls for a $2.92 million buyout. His annual salary was $1.95 million, the lowest in the 18-team league.",
      "The Gophers finished 15-17 after losing to Northwestern on Wednesday in the first round of the conference tournament. Athletic director Mark Coyle announced his decision early Thursday after a late-night meeting with Johnson upon the team's return from Indianapolis. The university posted the news on its website at 1:07 a.m. local time and on social media at 1:19 a.m.",
      "\u201cI thanked him for his dedication and for guiding the program, one he cares deeply about, for the last four years. Ben is a terrific person, and we wish him well,\u201d Coyle said in a statement distributed by the school. \u201cThese decisions are difficult and are made after careful consideration and evaluation. The expectation for our program is to compete for championships, and unfortunately, we have not done that in the last four years.\u201d",
      "Coyle, who serves on the NCAA Tournament selection committee, has long desired a return to relevancy in March for both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball teams. He worked previously at Kentucky and Syracuse, two campuses with long histories of hardwood success.",
      "\u201cThis is an extremely desirable job in one of the best conferences and cities in the nation, and we fully expect to compete at the highest level on and off the court,\" Coyle said. \"We provide a world-class experience for our student-athletes, have one of the best practice facilities in the nation and play games in a historic venue. We offer everything that is needed to be successful, and we will immediately begin a nationwide search for our next men\u2019s basketball coach.\u201d",
      "Minnesota went 56-71 under Johnson, including 22-57 in league play. The only team worse during that span was Washington, which just completed its first season as one of the Big Ten\u2019s four West Coast additions.",
      "The 44-year-old Johnson, who replaced Richard Pitino after previously serving five seasons as an assistant on his staff, was hired as a first-time head coach following three years as an assistant at Xavier. Johnson saw the top seven scorers from the 2020-21 team depart, coinciding with the NCAA\u2019s new transfer rules that allowed players to switch schools without having to sit out a season. Only two of 15 players from Pitino\u2019s last squad stayed, and the Gophers went 13-17.",
      "They bottomed out at 9-22 overall and 2-17 in the Big Ten in 2022-23, before making strides in 2023-24 with a spot in the NIT and a 19-15 finish. Their 9-11 conference record, though merely tied for ninth place, was significant considering Minnesota has hit the 10-win mark in Big Ten play just once in the last 20 years.",
      "But the advent of name, image and likeness earnings for college athletes threw yet another roadblock at Johnson\u2019s attempt to establish an identity and maintain some continuity, as programs with richer collectives lured key players away.",
      "Dawson Garcia, a second team All-Big Ten pick, stayed loyal for less and produced a stellar fifth season. But Pharrel Payne, another Minnesota native who would\u2019ve given the Gophers a formidable frontcourt for 2024-25, transferred to Texas A&M. Only four of the top 12 players from the 2023-24 team returned.",
      "\u201cThe money piece? It\u2019s everything. It\u2019s the only thing. I\u2019m going to be honest about it,\u201d Johnson said this season. \u201cOne thing I\u2019ve been proud of is we have been pretty smart and wise with how we\u2019ve done this. Just in terms of return on your investment, I think we have been pretty good.\u201d",
      "There were bright spots after an 0-6 start in conference play, with back-to-back road wins on the difficult West Coast trip to USC and UCLA and home upsets of ranked foes in Michigan and Oregon.",
      "But the Gophers consistently struggled to score, particularly when opponents had an effective game plan for denying Garcia the ball or the paint, and ranked last in the conference in points per game.",
      "Attendance at 97-year-old Williams Arena has waned, with the NBA\u2019s Timberwolves a much hotter ticket for hoops in the city and plenty of other competition for entertainment dollars in a place that\u2019s far more of a pro market than a college town. Minnesota had long been the only Division I program in a state that regularly produces Division I talent, but now there\u2019s also a newcomer to Division I just down the road at St. Thomas.",

      "Bridgeman was involved in one of the biggest trades in NBA history at the start of his professional career. After the Los Angeles Lakers selected Bridgeman with the eighth pick in the 1975 draft, they sent him to Milwaukee as part of the trade that brought Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to the West Coast.",
      "Bridgeman\u2019s 711 games played for Milwaukee ranks third in franchise history, behind only Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton. His No. 2 jersey was retired by the Bucks in 1988.",
      "\u201cHis hard work and perseverance led him to become one of the nation\u2019s top business leaders and, last September, Junior\u2019s professional life came full circle when he returned to the Bucks family as an owner,\u201d the Bucks said in a statement. \u201cHis memory will always be an inspiration to the Bucks organization.\u201d",
      "The Bucks announced Bridgeman had bought a stake in the team last year at a news conference that included co-owner Jimmy Haslam, coach Doc Rivers, general manager Jon Horst and many players. Bridgeman said afterward he had a 10% stake.",
      "\u201cThe opportunity to get back involved with the team in a different way and take advantage of it was something that was kind of a dream,\u201d Bridgeman said at the time.",
      "Prior to Milwaukee's game Tuesday night, Rivers said Bridgeman was a strong role model.",
      "\u201cThink about that kid growing up, wanting to be an NBA player, probably his dream, and he turned that dream into becoming an NBA owner,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cHe is the exact model the league should use every day when they are talking to our young players.\u201d",
      "Bridgeman played for the Bucks from 1975-84 and then spent two years with the Los Angeles Clippers before coming back to Milwaukee for his final NBA season in 1986-87. He scored 11,517 points (averaging 13.6 per game) in his career. He ranks seventh in Bucks history in field goals (4,142), ninth in points (9,892) and 10th in minutes (18,054).",
      "After his playing days, Bridgeman turned that same drive into a successful business career.",
      "\u201cWhile his play on the court was exceptional, it was as a leader in the business community that Junior truly excelled,\u201d University of Louisville President Kim Schatzel said in a statement.",
      "Bridgeman was a longtime franchisee for Wendy\u2019s and Chili\u2019s restaurants, at one time operating more than 450 locations in 20 states, the university said. He became a bottler for Coca-Cola and bought Ebony and Jet magazines, the school said.",
      "\u201cI had the privilege of playing against him, and I'll never forget how he had one of the sweetest jump shots in the NBA,\u201d retired Los Angeles Lakers star Magic Johnson wrote on X. \u201cWhat people don't realize is Junior didn't make a fortune as a player, but he turned what he earned into something extraordinary, becoming a billionaire African American businessman in this country.\u201d",
      "Bridgeman was part of the foursome that owns Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville. He also served on the boards of Churchill Downs racetrack, the University of Louisville and Fifth Third Bank, among others. He and his wife, Doris, hosted a Kentucky Derby party that served as a fundraiser.",
      "\u201cHe is the blueprint to so many current and former athletes across sports that success doesn't end when you're done playing,\u201d Johnson wrote.",
      "Besides his wife, he is survived by children Eden, Justin and Ryan.",

      "Former Wisconsin star Baylee Marabella had to play hockey alongside boys up until high school because she couldn\u2019t find a girls team in her area",
      "MILWAUKEE -- When Baylee Marabella got interested in ice hockey while growing up in Wisconsin, she had to play alongside boys up until high school because she couldn\u2019t find a girls team in her area.",
      "That isn\u2019t as much of a problem in hockey hotbeds such as Wisconsin anymore with a steady increase in the number of girls playing the sport. That trend helped launch the coaching career of Marabella, who was known as Baylee Wellhausen when she played on three Frozen Four teams with Wisconsin from 2014-18.",
      "Marabella now coaches Milwaukee School of Engineering, which just finished its inaugural season in Division III competition. It\u2019s one of more than two dozen D-III schools to start women\u2019s hockey teams over the last decade, capitalizing on the relative lack of cost compared to doing so in Division I.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s incredible,\u201d Marabella said of the rapid growth.",
      "MSOE was one of 78 schools to play women\u2019s ice hockey this year at the Division III level, which doesn't offer athletic scholarships. That represents a 50% increase from 2015, when there were 52 schools playing the sport at this level.",
      "Marabella believes those numbers can keep going up.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s going to be more and more girls who want to play college (hockey), so as we keep moving forward, the demand is going to be higher,\u201d Marabella said.",
      "Women\u2019s hockey in North America is on the rise and not only at the Division III level. The Professional Women\u2019s Hockey League is two months from completing its second season amid signs that attendance is up. The six-team league is drawing an average of 7,300 fans this season \u2013 up from 5,500 last year \u2013 and might expand by as many as two franchise next season.",
      "USA Hockey had 73,083 registrations among girls in 2023-24, a 47.4% increase over its 2013-14 total (49,587). Boys registrations increased by 4.8% over the same time, from 302,303 to 316,737.",
      "\u201cOverall, the skill level has gotten so much better over the years that it becomes one of those sports that was almost a no-brainer to be adding at the Division III level,\u201d said Joe Cranston, who coaches defending champion Wisconsin-River Falls, which hosts the D-III championship March 28-30. The 12-team tournament begins Saturday on campus sites.",
      "There are 44 women's hockey programs in Division I and Division II, a 12.8% rise from 2015 (39). The two divisions compete in a single national tournament, which ends this year with the Women's Frozen Four March 21-23 in Minneapolis.",
      "The modest growth at the higher level can be blamed on the bigger costs with adding a D-I program. Ice availability is a factor for any team at any level, and setting budgets is difficult for any athletic director dealing with the NCAA House settlement and name, image and likeness compensation questions.",
      "Minnesota reported operating expenses of a little over $3.6 million for women\u2019s hockey in 2023-24. Michigan released a feasibility study saying expenses would run about $4.5 million annually if it started a women\u2019s hockey program.",
      "By contrast, Wisconsin-River Falls reported $197,087 in women\u2019s hockey expenses in its 2024 Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act survey.",
      "Michelle McAteer has a unique perspective, as a new commissioner of a Division I conference (the Western Collegiate Hockey Association) who finished a 14-season run coaching Division III program Augsburg last year.",
      "\u201cHockey\u2019s an expensive sport to operate, and to operate a rink is an expensive investment,\u201d McAteer said. \u201cAt the Division III level, not everyone has their own rinks on campus. You can get by playing in community rinks and renting. The facility demands at the Division I level are quite different. The investment and infrastructure are a lot more. Everything is more. They have more significant travel. They have a more significant equipment budget, the staffing differences.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s probably enough talent nowadays to accommodate more Division I programs. The difference is apparent on the ice.",
      "\u201cTen to 12 years ago, there were a lot of teams at the Division I level that might have had one good line, a line-and-a-half, maybe two,\u201d said coach Mark Johnson, whose Badgers have been the top-ranked team in women's hockey most of the season. \u201cNow everybody\u2019s got two or three lines, maybe four lines, that can compete and play at a real high level.\u201d",
      "Because the schools in larger divisions haven\u2019t added women\u2019s hockey programs at a rate that correlates with the growth in the sport at the youth level, it\u2019s created more opportunities for Division III schools.",
      "\u201cI have kids on my team who were All-Americans 15 years ago who couldn\u2019t make my team now,\u201d Cranston said. \u201cKids who were Division I players 10 years ago who couldn\u2019t make my team now.\u201d",
      "Plattsburgh State won five titles in a six-year stretch from 2014-19, but there\u2019s been a different champion for each of the last five tournaments.",
      "Norwich won in 2018, Plattsburgh State in 2019, Middlebury in 2022, Gustavus Adolphus in 2023 and Wisconsin-River Falls last year. There were no Division III championships in 2020 or 2021 due to the pandemic.",
      "\u201cMost years there\u2019s maybe three or four teams that could win it all,\u201d Cranston said. \u201cI think this year there\u2019s probably twice that, probably seven or eight teams that could win the whole thing.\u201d",
      "SUNY Oswego athletic director Wendy McManus, the head of the NCAA Division III women\u2019s hockey committee, says smaller schools will continue adding the sport as long as youth participation stays strong.",
      "\u201cI do think eventually it will level off,\u201d McManus said. \u201cI say that because you don\u2019t see California schools or true West Coast schools playing hockey that much. We say \u2018West\u2019 is basically Minnesota, Wisconsin.\u201d",
      "That growth has provided welcome opportunities that might not have been available a decade earlier.",
      "For instance, MSOE\u2019s roster includes forward Hannah Baumann of Wausau, Wisconsin, who said she grew up idolizing Marabella and was a big Badgers fan. Baumann used to have to drive an hour to practice because of the relative lack of girls hockey teams.",
      "There now are more girls teams than ever, and some gather in the stands for MSOE\u2019s home games. That has particular meaning for forward Helen Bechthold, who grew up in the Milwaukee area playing for one of those youth programs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s cool to see they have all-girls teams playing now, because when I was playing, they didn\u2019t have all-girls teams,\u201d said Bechthold, who grew up playing with boys. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see. A lot of them were like, \u2018You played where we play\u2019 and stuff like that. That definitely makes me happy. I\u2019m happy they have that opportunity.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Pittsburgh Penguins goaltender Tristan Jarry is off to a strong start in his return to the NHL",
      "PITTSBURGH -- Tristan Jarry's career was at a crossroads in mid-January. The Pittsburgh Penguins goaltender was struggling and even worse, the franchise's faith in him appeared to be shot.",
      "Things grew so bleak for Jarry at the end of a stretch in which he dropped six straight starts that general manager Kyle Dubas \u2014 the same man who'd signed Jarry to a five-year deal shortly after taking over in the summer of 2023 \u2014 made the unusual decision to send Jarry to the minors.",
      "Not just to get some reps in, but seemingly for good.",
      "Players with two All-Star appearances and millions in the bank typically don't make their way back after a fall like that. At least not with the same team.",
      "Yet there Jarry was on Tuesday night standing inside PPG Paints Arena, turning aside 36 shots in a 3-2 overtime victory over Vegas that offered hope that while Pittsburgh's season is all but lost, Jarry's tenure with the only NHL club he's ever known might not be.",
      "Yes, those six-plus weeks in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton riding the bus to Bridgeport and Lehigh Valley were \u201ctough\u201d as he put it. They may also have been necessary.",
      "\u201cIt was something I had to work through,\u201d Jarry said. \u201cSomething I need to look at myself in the mirror and just say \u2018I need to have a better game.\u2019\u201d",
      "The Penguins called Jarry back up quietly earlier this month when 23-year-old Joel Blomqvist \u2014 potentially the club's goalie of the future \u2014 had struggles of his own during a somewhat extended NHL look.",
      "Jarry returned to the lineup on Sunday in a road victory over likely playoff-bound Minnesota. Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan called Jarry \u201cspectacular\u201d while outdueling future Hall of Famer and former Penguin Marc-Andre Fleury.",
      "Sullivan saw enough to give Jarry the nod again against Pacific Division-leading Vegas, a potentially fraught assignment for a player who hasn't looked comfortable playing at home this season.",
      "Yet the jitters \u2014 particularly the early-game ones that have popped up frequently during a season in which he has allowed a first-shot goal six times \u2014 never materialized. Jarry turned aside the first puck the Golden Knights threw his way and quickly settled into the game.",
      "Vegas, which is charging toward the postseason, dominated for long stretches. Jarry responded by showcasing the athleticism that's always been there and the confidence, which admittedly hasn't.",
      "He was at his best in the third period. During one sequence Jarry turned aside a breakaway and a wraparound attempt within seconds of each other to protect a one-goal lead. When the whistle blew, the crowd that reveled in booing him in mid-winter was cheering his name instead.",
      "Though Vegas tied it late on a slap shot by Noah Hanifin, Pittsburgh prevailed in overtime to secure two points in a season in which they've been hard to come by. Jarry's uneven play is one of the major reasons the Penguins will likely miss the playoffs for a third straight year.",
      "Yet if he can find something over the next month, he could perhaps make his contract that features an average cap hit of $5 million palatable for another team to take on. Or maybe a goaltender who has been part of the problem during Pittsburgh's swoon could end up being part of the solution.",
      "\u201cHe's got a long body of work in Pittsburgh that suggests strongly that he\u2019s an NHL goaltender,\u201d Sullivan said of Jarry. \"We\u2019ve said that on many occasions ... He\u2019s made the All-Star team twice, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s coincidence. There\u2019s substance there.\u201d",
      "Jarry needs to pair that substance with consistency and maybe a dash of toughness too. He's been around long enough \u2014 Jarry made his NHL debut nearly eight years ago \u2014 to know two solid games doesn't mean he's \u201cback.\u201d Every meaningful stat, from goals against average (3.15) to save percentage (.893), ranks as the worst of his career.",
      "There's more work to be done. Probably a lot more. Yet he finds himself in a better place than he was in mid-January. He believes being sent down freed him in a way. He had nothing left to lose, so Jarry headed to the AHL with a \u201cfree mind\" that has helped pave the way for a comeback that seemed remote not long ago.",
      "\u201cI think just over my time that I\u2019ve been playing in the NHL, I\u2019ve played a lot of good hockey,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I want to continue that.\u201d",
      "Given Pittsburgh's spot in the standings and the need to get a feel once and for all whether he can reclaim the team's No. 1 goaltending spot, Jarry probably won't lack for opportunities down the stretch. What he does with them will say plenty about his future.",
      "\u201cFor whatever reason it didn\u2019t go the way any of us hoped (early in the season),\u201d Sullivan said. \"I think he\u2019s just showing what he\u2019s capable of, quite honestly.\u201d",

      "With Josh Allen's personal and financial life set, the NFL MVP is focusing his attention on unfinished business: leading the Buffalo Bills to a Super Bowl title",
      "ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- As blessed as Josh Allen considers himself following a year in which he was voted NFL MVP, got engaged to a Hollywood actor and became one of the league\u2019s top-paid players, one item remains on the Buffalo Bills quarterback\u2019s to-do list.",
      "Win a Super Bowl, of course.",
      "\u201cAnybody I run into, friend or not friend, it\u2019s always a congrats for having a heck of a year,\u201d Allen told reporters on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cAnd when you kind of look back at it, the only thing missing is finishing our season with a win,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s really the only thing I\u2019m thinking about, just trying to continue to get better and find a way to bring a Lombardi Trophy to western New York.\u201d",
      "Though his focus remains on the future, Allen took time to appreciate the moment, three days after agreeing to a six-year, $330 million contract extension, with an NFL-record $250 million guaranteed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty surreal feeling. And 8-year-old me would obviously be just as pumped as a 28-year-old me,\u201d Allen said, speaking on a Zoom call from his offseason base in Southern California.",
      "\u201cI just think I\u2019m blessed. Sometimes it is a little breath-taking, or you can\u2019t find the right words on how to describe it,\" he added. \u201cI\u2019m a pretty lucky guy.\u201d",
      "Resilient, too, as Allen also reflected on the obstacles he has overcome: from starting his career at Reedley Community College in Central California, to transferring to Wyoming, where he was knocked for being raw and inaccurate, never mind those who continued to doubt him over the past year.",
      "\u201cMaybe, we\u2019ll see,\u201d Allen said with a laugh on whether he\u2019s closed the book on being called overrated.",
      "Though the closest he has led the Bills to a Super Bowl berth is two AFC championship game losses to Kansas City in 2020 and this past season, Allen has a hold on his adopted community and team that are unquestioned since Buffalo traded up five spots to draft him seventh overall in 2018.",
      "He has set nearly every single-season franchise passing and scoring record for his position while leading Buffalo to five straight AFC East titles.",
      "And he\u2019s coming off a season regarded as his most memorable on and off the field.",
      "Allen became the Bills third player to win MVP honors, being recognized for essentially achieving more with less after Buffalo traded top threat Stefon Diggs to Houston and lost No. 2 receiver Gabe Davis in free agency. He combined for 41 touchdowns, including one receiving, with a career-low six interceptions in a 13-win season.",
      "Off the field, he got engaged to Hailee Steinfeld in November.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so grateful for what\u2019s going on in my life and finding the person that I want to share it with,\u201d Allen said. \u201cWhen you have that piece figured out, it seems like everything else kind of comes a little bit easier.\u201d",
      "Now Allen has a new contract that locks him in through 2030, a deal he negotiated with an eye on helping the team. As eye-popping as the numbers are, Allen made sure the contract helped the Bills by freeing up much-needed salary cap space in order to retain and add talent.",
      "The benefits were readily apparent in the days leading up to free agency on Wednesday. The Bills upgraded their defensive line by signing edge rusher Joey Bosa and tackle Larry Ogunjobi to one-year deals and landed receiver Joshua Palmer.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s weird to say this, but what is $5 million more going to do for my life that I can\u2019t already do right now. It\u2019s not that crazy to me,\u201d Allen said. \u201cI was like, if it has any impact on the cap, let\u2019s figure out a way to not do that.\u201d",
      "Though Allen\u2019s deal places him tied for second among NFL players by averaging $55 million per year, the contract ranks 13th by taking up only 19.7% of his team\u2019s cap total.",
      "Allen is cashing in for a second time, following the six-year, $258 million deal he signed in August 2021. Buffalo is where Allen feels like home, and it\u2019s where he wants to finish out his career.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to play anywhere else,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s time to put the cleats up, hopefully it\u2019ll be in Buffalo.\u201d",
      "Allen then laughed, saying he\u2019s far from considering retirement, while at the same time appreciating how quickly time has passed.",
      "\u201cIt feels like an eternity ago, but I still remember being the guy sitting on the sidelines in junior college just waiting for a chance to get on the field,\u201d Allen said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not a very nostalgic person. I focus more so on what\u2019s going on right now, trying to be where my feet are and take it just one day at a time.\u201d",

      "Residents shaken awake by the early-morning quake sought safety in the streets, as they did in May.",
      "The temblor, which loosened stone and cement from some facades, was centered just offshore from Pozzuoli, a seaside suburb bordering Naples. Mayor Gaetano Manfredi told reporters that one church, a seven-story residential building and another building were declared off-limits due to damage, and some schools were closed as a precaution.",

      "Hundreds of users reported FAFSA outages to Downdetector starting midday Wednesday, saying they were having trouble completing the form, which is required for financial aid at colleges nationwide. The National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, a group of people who handle colleges' financial aid awards, also received reports of users experiencing technical issues and having trouble completing the FAFSA.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to get more clarity on why it\u2019s down,\" said Allie Bidwell Arcese, a spokeswoman for NASFAA. The Education Department hadn't shared any information on the outage, she said. \u201cThe maintenance and troubleshooting may be impacted by yesterday\u2019s layoffs.\u201d",
      "The developers and IT support staff who worked on the FAFSA form were hard hit in the Education Department's layoffs Tuesday, along with staff buyouts and the termination of probationary employees. In all, the Education Department has reduced its staff by half, to roughly 2,000, since Trump took office.",
      "A list of laid-off staff obtained and verified by AP shows more than 300 people cut from Federal Student Aid \u2014 two dozen of them from Federal Student Aid's technology division. That included the entire team responsible for systems supporting the FAFSA form, a person with knowledge of the outage told The Associated Press, speaking anonymously for fear of retaliation. While laid-off staffers are still technically employed until March 21, they had limited access to their email, phones and computers, making a response to the outage difficult, the person said. At one point Wednesday, about 70 people had joined a Teams call to try to pinpoint the cause of the outage.",
      "The call continued for hours. By Wednesday evening, the website carried a banner claiming \u201cPlanned Maintenance\u201d was underway, and login access was cut off.",
      "The Education Department did not respond to a request for comment on the outage.",
      "Problems with the FAFSA had vexed the administration of former President Joe Biden, drawing rebuke from Republicans. The form was overhauled last year in an attempt to simplify it, but technical problems blocked students from submitting forms or bungled financial aid calculations.",
      "Advocates say the frustration probably led thousands of students to give up on going to college at all. Last fall, U.S. colleges saw a 5% decrease in freshmen enrollment over the previous year, and it was deeper at colleges with large numbers of low-income students, according to the National Student Clearinghouse.",

      "Universities across the U.S. have announced hiring freezes, citing new financial uncertainty as the Trump administration threatens a range of cuts to federal contracts and research grants.",
      "In February, the administration announced deep cuts to National Institutes of Health grants for research institutions, a shift that could reduce the money going to some universities by over $100 million. Some schools already have shelved projects because of the cuts, which have been delayed temporarily by a court challenge.",
      "Recently, President Donald Trump has shown appetite for targeting colleges\u2019 funding more directly. His administration has vowed to take federal money from colleges that defy his agenda on issues including diversity, equity and inclusion programs, transgender athletes\u2019 participation in women\u2019s sports, and student protests that he deems \u201cillegal.\u201d",
      "On March 7, the administration on Friday pulled $400 million from Columbia University over what it described as the Ivy League school\u2019s failure to squelch antisemitism on campus. The Education Department followed up with a letter Monday warning 60 colleges they could lose federal money if they fail to make campuses safe for Jewish students.",
      "Higher education has been a steady job generator since the pandemic, with private colleges and universities adding 35,000 jobs nationwide last year. Hiring freezes and cuts at universities could contribute to slower job growth in the months ahead, advocates for workers say.",
      "Over the last two weeks, more than a dozen institutions have announced limits on hiring for faculty and staff positions and other measures to tighten purse strings.",
      "Hiring freezes have been announced at schools including Harvard; the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Notre Dame; the University of Pennsylvania; the University of Pittsburgh; Emory University; the University of Vermont; North Carolina State University; the University of Washington; and the University of California, San Diego.",
      "In a statement, Harvard leaders said the decision was \u201cmeant to preserve our financial flexibility until we better understand how changes in federal policy will take shape and can assess the scale of their impact.\u201d",
      "The University of Washington\u2019s provost, Tricia Serio, said in a blog post she recognized how the uncertainty of the moment could \u201cprompt stress, worry and anxiety.\u201d",
      "\u201cBy using this time to proactively save our resources and thoughtfully plan, we will be better prepared to manage any future funding cuts to protect our mission for the public good,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Several universities said they also are looking for other ways to reduce expenses, including Emory, where President Gregory Fenves said it is necessary to \u201ctake prudent measures to prepare for what may be a significant disruption to our finances.\u201d",
      "Colleges had been bracing for head winds under the new administration, including the possibility of a big hike in the tax on university endowments. But the new administration has taken several steps that have heightened uncertainty.",
      "In addition to the reductions ordered to NIH grants, money for research and projects has been held up by delays in approval processes and cuts to programs linked to DEI.",
      "After a dustup between Trump and Maine\u2019s governor over transgender athletes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture suspended funding for research at the University of Maine. The funding was restored this week, officials said.",
      "The $400 million hit to Columbia in particular shook institutions of higher education.",
      "The withdrawal of federal money is not the way to fight hate, said Ted Mitchell, president of the American Council of Education. The cancelation, he said, will \u201ceviscerate academic and research activities\u201d at Columbia.",
      "\u201cBut we also are deeply concerned that unless the administration reverses course, it will move on to wrongly target research at other institutions, wreaking further chaos, confusion, and negative consequences,\u201d Mitchell said.",
      "On Thursday, U.S. officials said a federal task force to combat antisemitism had notified leaders in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Boston that it wants to meet and discuss incidents where colleges in their cities may have failed to protect Jewish students from discrimination. ___",

      "The U.S. stock market has just dropped 10% from its high set last month, hurt by worries about the economy and a global trade war",
      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. stock market has just dropped 10% from its high set last month, hurt by worries about the economy and a global trade war.",
      "T he fall for the S&P 500 is steep enough that Wall Street has a name for it: a \u201ccorrection.\u201d Such drops have happened regularly for more than a century, and market pros often view them as potentially healthy wipeouts of overdone euphoria, which could send stock prices too high if unchecked.",
      "But corrections are frightening in the moment, particularly for every new generation of investors that gets into the market at a time when it seems like stocks only go up.",
      "The S&P 500 is coming off two straight years with gains of more than 20%. Such stellar gains left the market looking too expensive to critics, who pointed to how prices rose faster than corporate profits.",
      "Culling too-high enthusiasm among day traders is one thing. The larger fear always accompanying a correction is that it could be a warning sign of a coming \"bear market,\" which is what Wall Street calls a drop of at least 20%.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at what history shows about past corrections, and what market watchers are expecting going forward.",
      "The U.S. stock market initially jumped after President Donald Trump's election in November on hopes he'd bring lower taxes, less regulation for businesses and other policies that would drive corporate profits higher. All those gains have since disappeared, as Wall Street faces the potential downsides of Trump's White House for the economy.",
      "The president has been making announcements on tariffs at a dizzying pace, first placing them on trading partners, then exempting some and then doing it all over again. The tariffs could hit every country that trades with the United States, which would raise prices for U.S. households and businesses when high inflation has already proven stubborn to fully subdue.",
      "The fear is that tariffs could slow or even halt the solid growth the U.S. economy was showing when it ended 2024. Even if Trump ultimately goes forward with less painful tariffs, all the uncertainty around the will-he-or-won't-he rollout could prove damaging by freezing economic activity. Such concerns have shown up in the latest readings on consumer confidence, as well as companies' forecasts for future profits.",
      "Trump himself has acknowledged his plans could affect the U.S. economy's growth.",
      "All the uncertainty is also making things more complicated for the Federal Reserve, which had been cutting interest rates after getting inflation nearly all the way down to its 2% target. Cutting rates further would help the economy, but it could also put upward pressure on inflation.",
      "The brunt of this sell-off has also hit stocks that critics were saying looked the most expensive after running wild through the frenzy around artificial intelligence. Nvidia, for example, has already dropped roughly 14% in 2025 so far after surging more than 800% through 2023 and 2024.",
      "Most of the other big stocks in the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d that have dominated the market recently have also been lagging the rest of the S&P 500. Those seven stocks alone had accounted for more than half the S&P 500\u2019s total return last year.",
      "Every couple years, on average. Even during the historic, nearly 11-year-long bull run for U.S. stocks from March 2009 to February 2020, the S&P 500 stumbled to five corrections, according to CFRA. Worries about everything from interest rates to trade wars to a European debt crisis caused the pullbacks.",
      "The U.S. market's last correction was in 2023, when the S&P 500 dropped 10.3% from the end of July into October. At the time, high Treasury yields were undercutting stock prices as traders accepted a new normal where the Fed would keep rates high for a while. But stocks would quickly turn higher as optimism revived that cuts to rates were on the horizon.",
      "The last correction that did graduate into a bear market was in 2022. That's when the Fed first began cranking up interest rates to combat the worst inflation in generations. Worries rose that high rates would slow the economy enough to create a recession, one that ultimately never came.",
      "Through the 2022 bear market, the S&P 500 fell 25.4% from Jan. 3 to Oct. 12.",
      "Looking only at corrections since 1946 that managed to right themselves before turning into a bear market, the S&P 500 has taken an average of 133 days to hit bottom and lost an average of nearly 14% along the way, according to CFRA. The index has taken an average of 113 days to recoup its losses.",
      "For declines that become bear markets, the damage is much worse. Going back to 1929, the average bear market has taken an average of nearly 19 months to hit bottom and caused a loss of 38.5% for the S&P 500, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.",
      "On paper, an investor can lose most of their money. From late 1929 into the middle of 1932, the stock market fell a little more than 86%, for example.",
      "A bear market can also feel interminable: One lasted more than five years, from 1937 into 1942, where U.S. stocks lost 60%, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.",
      "In Japan, after the Nikkei 225 index set a record at the end of 1989, it sank and then took decades to fully recover. It wasn't until 2024 that it got back to that peak.",
      "The Japanese example is an outlier, though. In almost every case, investors would have made back all their losses from a downturn for U.S. stocks if they simply held on and didn't sell. That includes the 2000 dot-com bust, the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 coronavirus collapse.",
      "No one knows. Some investors on Wall Street say they expect Trump to pull back on some policies if they prove to be too damaging, while others say the uncertainty alone is creating enough pain.",
      "The economy has given signals that it's still relatively solid at the moment, including last month's jobs report, but the outlook looks cloudier than usual given all the unknowns."

      "WASHINGTON -- There sat Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation\u2019s top health official, at a Steak \u2019n Shake with Fox News host Sean Hannity, raving about the fries.",
      "\u201cSteak \u2019n Shake has been great, we\u2019re very grateful for them,\u201d Kennedy said, in between nibbles of fries that the Midwestern franchise recently announced would be cooked in beef tallow instead of common cooking oils that Kennedy says are bad for Americans' diet.",
      "It's the kind of endorsement that doctors have implored him to make about the childhood vaccines used to prevent deadly diseases, like measles as outbreaks worsened in Texas and New Mexico during his first month in office.",
      "The secretary of Health and Human Services has, instead, raised doubts about vaccines, most recently saying in his interview with Hannity that the shots cause \u201cdeaths every year,\" although he later added that vaccinations should be encouraged.",
      "In his first month in office, Kennedy, who vowed to \u201cMake America Healthy Again,\u201d has delivered an inconsistent message that has the nation's top infectious diseases specialists worried that his tepid recommendations of vaccines will undermine access to long-proven remedies.",
      "During his first address to thousands of workers at the federal public health agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as the Food and Drug Administration, Kennedy promised to \u201cinvestigate\u201d the childhood vaccine schedule. Days later, the CDC cancelled a public meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Panel, a group of doctors and scientists who make recommendations on vaccines. That meeting has not been rescheduled.",
      "In another case, a cancelled public meeting of vaccine advisers who make recommendations on the flu vaccine every year for the FDA also has not been given a new date. This week, the National Institutes for Health, also under Kennedy's purview, began cancelling funding for some research on vaccines.",
      "The CDC also is preparing to research autism and vaccines, planning to \"leave no stone unturned in its mission to figure out what exactly is happening,\u201d HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon said in a statement. Agency officials did not comment further for this article.",
      "Numerous studies have concluded that there is no link between the two, a fact the agency states on its website.",
      "\u201cWhat he is trying to do is scare about the safety of vaccines,\u201d Dr. Paul Offit, an FDA vaccine adviser and infectious disease doctor at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, said of Kennedy's first month in office. \u201cIt shouldn't surprise anybody. His agenda has always been to get vaccines off the market, or to make them less available.\u201d",
      "Offit worries that the cancellation of the FDA\u2019s flu vaccine meeting, held every March for at least 30 years, is just the beginning. The committee's June meeting to recommend the COVID-19 vaccine's formulation has also not been scheduled, he said.",
      "Democrats and Republicans pushed back when Dr. Marty Makary, the FDA nominee, wouldn\u2019t commit to rescheduling the committee's flu meeting .",
      "\u201cWhat is lost is the transparency,\u201d said Sen. Bill Cassidy, the Louisiana Republican who chairs the Senate health committee who is also a physician.",
      "During his senate confirmation hearings earlier this year, Kennedy repeatedly rejected any notion that he would undermine vaccines. \u201cI support vaccines. I support the childhood schedule,\u201d he said. He promised Cassidy, who was unsettled about Kennedy's anti-vaccine advocacy work, that he would not change existing vaccine recommendations.",
      "But Kennedy\u2019s skeptical views of vaccines have emerged during interviews and public statements since his confirmation.",
      "He's sent \u201cmixed messages\u201d on vaccine safety, even though the U.S. has \u201cthe most elaborate vaccine adverse event surveillance system in the world,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University. Serious problems, including death, are very rare and the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks, he said.",
      "\u201cA simple way to describe this to the average person is the serious adverse events generally occur at a rate of 1 to a few cases per million doses of vaccine,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a needle in a haystack.\u201d",
      "In an opinion piece on FoxNews.com earlier this month, Kennedy said the measles outbreak in West Texas that left a six-year old child dead was a \u201ccall to action\u201d but stopped short of recommending that people receive the vaccine that prevents 97% of cases. Despite the U.S. registering its first measles death in a decade, Kennedy has repeatedly downplayed this year's outbreaks, noting that when he was a child \u201ceverybody got measles.\"",
      "This year's cases \u2014 reported at 250 \u2014 are on track to far outpace last year's reports of 286 measles infections.",
      "Pediatricians are fielding more questions from confused parents in their exam rooms, said Dr. Susan Kressly. Worried about reports of cancelled vaccine meetings, they\u2019re wondering about their access to next year\u2019s flu vaccines. Others are asking if they should get doses of the Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccine earlier. Kressly said there\u2019s a clear message the government can send to help stop the rising case count.",
      "\u201cThe only way to stop an outbreak is increased coordinated positive messaging around vaccinating,\u201d Kressly said.",
      "The CDC has assisted with vaccination efforts in West Texas. But Kennedy himself has publicly advocated for an alternative treatment for measles: Vitamin A. Under his watch, the CDC\u2019s guidance was updated to say that Vitamin A should be given to children with severe measles and prescribed in doses under a doctor\u2019s supervision.",
      "Vitamin A supplementation has been recommended for decades to reduce pneumonia and death in malnourished children in developing countries, but the benefits in well-nourished children in countries like the U.S. are less clear.",
      "\u201cWe need to use Vitamin A for those kids who are unlucky enough to get measles,\u201d said Dr. Andy Pavia, a pediatric infectious disease expert at the University of Utah. \u201cBut it can\u2019t prevent measles and it can only provide some help in reducing the severity.\u201d",
      "When administered correctly, using Vitamin A in kids with severe measles will \u201cdo no harm,\u201d Pavia said. But if improperly done, high doses of Vitamin A can be toxic and deadly.",
      "Abrupt staffing changes have also dominated Kennedy's first weeks in office, with CDC pick Dave Weldon withdrawing from the nomination mere minutes before his hearing, Kennedy's top HHS spokesman quitting two weeks into the job and the Food and Drug Administration's newly minted chief counsel departing 48 hours into the position.",
      "Trump and Kennedy's supporters, however, have dismissed concerns about the rocky start.",
      "His newfound platform as health secretary and talk of healthier foods is already affecting change in the American diet, advisers close to Kennedy and Trump have claimed on social media.",
      "They credit Kennedy with prompting Republican legislators to introduce bills in Utah and Texas that would ban soda in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, for example. And then there's Steak \u2018n Shake\u2019s new fries.",
      "\u201cRFK Jr. just ate Steak \u2019n Shake on live TV, the fast food joint that\u2019s bravely frying everything in beef tallow,\u201d conservative podcaster Charlie Kirk said this week in a tweet. \u201cThis is the way.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, after a meeting with a handful of executives from the nation's largest food manufactures, Kennedy released a slickly-produced video that promised more change would be on the way, saying companies were taking his \u201cMAHA\" movement seriously.",
      "\u201cThey understand they have a new sheriff in town,\u201d Kennedy said.",
      "He did not share any details about what was discussed at the meeting.",

      "WASHINGTON -- At least 112 North American bird species have lost more than half their populations in the past 50 years, according to a new report published Thursday.",
      "Among the birds showing the steepest declines are Allen\u2019s hummingbirds, Florida scrub jays, golden-cheeked warblers, tricolored blackbirds and yellow-billed magpies.",
      "\u201cThese are the very real consequences if we are unable to conserve and protect the crucial habitats that birds need,\u201d said study co-author Mike Brasher, a senior scientist at the nonprofit Ducks Unlimited.",
      "For several decades, waterfowl stood out as a conservation bright spot with duck populations growing nationwide even as many other groups of birds declined in the U.S. But that trend has reversed, the new data shows.",
      "The total number of dabbling and diving ducks is down about 30% from 2017, said Brasher. Loss of grasslands habitat and a prolonged drought affecting the wetlands of the Great Plains\u2019 prairie pothole region have taken a toll. Among all waterfowl, numbers are down 20% since 2014, the report found.",
      "The latest report is a collaboration between several groups including Cornell University, Ducks Unlimited, American Bird Conservancy, National Audubon Society and the American Ornithological Society.",
      "The work draws on survey data from the U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and citizen projects such as Cornell's eBird. There are some 2,000 bird species in North America. A third of the species examined are rated as high or moderate concern for conservation due to declining numbers, habitat loss or other threats.",
      "These birds \u201cneed urgent conservation attention,\u201d said Amanda Rodewald, a study co-author from Cornell, adding that bird survey trends also reveal the health of their habitats.",

    "story": [
      "Vaccines could be a key means of suppressing bird flu and avoiding the slaughter of millions of chickens, which is blamed for egg prices averaging nearly $5 a dozen",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Vaccines could be a key means of suppressing bird flu and avoiding the slaughter of millions of chickens, which is blamed for egg prices averaging nearly $6 a dozen. But the move has been delayed in part because of concerns it could jeopardize chicken exports worth billions of dollars a year.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has announced plans to spend $100 million to study bird flu vaccines to fight the disease in concert with meat chicken, egg and turkey groups. That's part of a larger $1 billion effort to invest in more protections to keep the virus off farms that President Donald Trump believes will help lower egg prices.",
      "Chicken meat producers remain the most resistant to vaccines because of concerns they could harm meat exports, which totaled nearly $4.7 billion last year. Egg and turkey producers sell most of their products in the U.S. and have been hit hardest by the virus.",
      "Without a new policy including vaccines, the government will continue to slaughter every flock with a bird flu infection to limit the spread of the disease. Those deaths have totaled over 166 million birds in the U.S. since 2022.",
      "Most birds killed are egg-laying chickens, and the death of so many hens is the main reason egg prices keep rising. The average price per dozen has hit $5.90, and in some part of the country, it is far higher.",
      "Poultry veterinarian Simon Shane, who runs www.Egg-News.com, said the government is hesitant to use vaccines and change its policy of killing birds largely because of the meat chicken industry's opposition.",
      "\u201cBasically this is a political issue, and this only came to a head because eggs are at $8 to $9 a dozen, and it\u2019s embarrassing the government \u2014 embarrassing the present administration,\u201d Shane said.",
      "Before using vaccinations, the government must decide how to devise an effective system and monitor for outbreaks within vaccinated flocks that might not show any symptoms, said John Clifford, the USDA's former longtime chief veterinary officer, who now works with a poultry industry export group. Once that is figured out, the industry can negotiate with countries to minimize trade problems.",
      "\u201cWhat the industry wants is the ability to develop the strategic plan to share that with the trading partners and then find out what kind of impact that that will have on trade,\u201d Clifford said.",
      "There are fears that vaccinating could allow the virus to linger undetected in flocks and mutate in ways that could make it more of a threat to humans and allow sick birds to get into the food supply. Like with other diseases, properly cooking chicken to 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius) will kill bird flu, but the industry and chicken buyers don't want it there at all.",
      "For meat chicken, known as broilers, the virus isn't as significant because those birds are slaughtered at 6 to 8 weeks old and thus have less chance of being infected compared with egg-laying hens, which live to 2 years or older. Also most broilers are raised in the Southeast, which hasn't had as many outbreaks as the Midwest and West.",
      "Another delay to vaccinating concerns distribution. Egg farmers want to administer it through chicken feed or water, saying it's not practical to give shots to millions of birds in a single barn.",
      "It can also be difficult to tell the difference between a vaccinated bird and one that has been sick with the virus. That would make other countries nervous about importing meat.",
      "\u201cPeople have talked about how expensive it would be to monitor vaccinated populations. And it would be. But where do we want to spend our money?\u201d said Dr. Carol Cardona, a bird flu expert at the University of Minnesota. \u201cWe\u2019re spending our money hand over fist right now in depopulation and to buy eggs for breakfast.\u201d",
      "China and Mexico have been vaccinating their poultry for years, but they take different approaches.",
      "In Mexico chicken are vaccinated, but Clifford said the country doesn't slaughter flocks when infections are found. That basically ensures the virus is present in poultry.",
      "China still slaughters vaccinated flocks when infections are found, which has proven more effective at limiting the spread of the virus and reigning in outbreaks.",
      "Clifford said the U.S. would need to continue culling flocks with outbreaks even after vaccinating, and it might make sense to give shots only to egg layers and turkeys, not broilers.",
      "Don't expect big relief anytime soon.",
      "The USDA, which did not respond to a request for comment for this article sent last week, clearly isn't moving to vaccinate immediately. And, regardless, it will take time to raise new hens.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to wait to replace those with new hatched chicks, and it takes 20 weeks before they even start laying,\u201d Shane said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t know where they\u2019re going to get the eggs from.\u201d",
      "Prices may ease somewhat later this year after peak demand, which happens around Easter, if massive egg farms in Iowa, Ohio, California and elsewhere can avoid more outbreaks.",
      "The USDA has predicted that average egg prices will be 41% higher than the 2024 average of $3.17 per dozen. That would mean $4.47 per dozen, slightly below the current average."

      "Scientists report that a fossil of a partial face from a early human ancestor in Spain is between 1.1 and 1.4 million years old",
      "WASHINGTON -- A fossil of a partial face from a human ancestor is the oldest in western Europe, archaeologists reported Wednesday.",
      "The incomplete skull \u2014 a section of the left cheek bone and upper jaw \u2013 was found in northern Spain in 2022. The fossil is between 1.1 million and 1.4 million years old, according to research published in the journal Nature.",
      "\u201cThe fossil is exciting,\" said Eric Delson, a paleontologist at the American Museum of Natural History, who was not involved in the study. \u201cIt's the first time we have significant remains older than 1 million years old in western Europe.\u201d",
      "A collection of older fossils from early human ancestors was previously found in Georgia, near the crossroads of eastern Europe and Asia. Those are estimated to be 1.8 million years old.",
      "The Spanish fossil is the first evidence that clearly shows human ancestors \u201cwere taking excursions into Europe\u201d at that time, said Rick Potts, director of the Smithsonian\u2019s Human Origins Program.",
      "But there is not yet evidence that the earliest arrivals persisted there long, he said. \u201cThey may get to a new location and then die out,\u201d said Potts, who had no role in the study.",
      "The partial skull bears many similarities to Homo erectus, but there are also some anatomical differences, said study co-author Rosa Huguet, an archaeologist at the Catalan Institute of Human Paleoecology and Social Evolution in Tarragona, Spain.",
      "Homo erectus arose around 2 million years ago and moved from Africa to regions of Asia and Europe, with the last individuals dying out around 100,000 years ago, said Potts.",
      "It can be challenging to identify which group of early humans a fossil find belongs to if there's only a single fragment versus many bones that show a range of features, said University of Zurich paleoanthropologist Christoph Zollikofer, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The same cave complex in Spain's Atapuerca Mountains where the new fossil was found also previously yielded other significant clues to the ancient human past. Researchers working in the region have also found more recent fossils from Neanderthals and early Homo sapiens.",

      "Schools are turning to AI-powered surveillance technology to monitor students on school-issued devices like laptops and tablets",
      "One student asked a search engine, \u201cWhy does my boyfriend hit me?\u201d Another threatened suicide in an email to an unrequited love. A gay teen opened up in an online diary about struggles with homophobic parents, writing they just wanted to be themselves.",
      "In each case and thousands of others, surveillance software powered by artificial intelligence immediately alerted Vancouver Public Schools staff in Washington state.",
      "Vancouver and many other districts around the country have turned to technology to monitor school-issued devices 24/7 for any signs of danger as they grapple with a student mental health crisis and the threat of shootings.",
      "The goal is to keep children safe, but these tools raise serious questions about privacy and security \u2014 as proven when Seattle Times and Associated Press reporters inadvertently received access to almost 3,500 sensitive, unredacted student documents through a records request about the district\u2019s surveillance technology.",
      "___",
      "The Education Reporting Collaborative, a coalition of eight newsrooms, is investigating the unintended consequences of AI-powered surveillance at schools. Members of the Collaborative are AL.com, The Associated Press, The Christian Science Monitor, The Dallas Morning News, The Hechinger Report, Idaho Education News, The Post and Courier in South Carolina, and The Seattle Times.",
      "___",
      "The released documents show students use these laptops for more than just schoolwork; they are coping with angst in their personal lives.",
      "Students wrote about depression, heartbreak, suicide, addiction, bullying and eating disorders. There are poems, college essays and excerpts from role-play sessions with AI chatbots.",
      "Vancouver school staff and anyone else with links to the files could read everything. Firewalls or passwords didn\u2019t protect the documents, and student names were not redacted, which cybersecurity experts warned was a massive security risk.",
      "The monitoring tools often helped counselors reach out to students who might have otherwise struggled in silence. But the Vancouver case is a stark reminder of surveillance technology\u2019s unintended consequences in American schools.",
      "In some cases, the technology has outed LGBTQ+ children and eroded trust between students and school staff, while failing to keep schools completely safe.",
      "Gaggle Safety Management, the company that developed the software that tracks Vancouver schools students\u2019 online activity, believes not monitoring children is like letting them loose on \u201ca digital playground without fences or recess monitors,\u201d CEO and founder Jeff Patterson said.",
      "Roughly 1,500 school districts nationwide use Gaggle\u2019s software to track the online activity of approximately 6 million students. It\u2019s one of many companies, like GoGuardian and Securly, that promise to keep kids safe through AI-assisted web surveillance.",
      "The technology has been in high demand since the pandemic, when nearly every child received a school-issued tablet or laptop. According to a U.S. Senate investigation, over 7,000 schools or districts used GoGuardian\u2019s surveillance products in 2021.",
      "Vancouver schools apologized for releasing the documents. Still, the district emphasizes Gaggle is necessary to protect students\u2019 well-being.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we could ever put a price on protecting students,\u201d said Andy Meyer, principal of Vancouver\u2019s Skyview High School. \u201cAnytime we learn of something like that and we can intervene, we feel that is very positive.\u201d",
      "Dacia Foster, a parent in the district, commended the efforts to keep students safe but worries about privacy violations.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not good at all,\u201d Foster said after learning the district inadvertently released the records. \u201cBut what are my options? What do I do? Pull my kid out of school?\u201d",
      "Foster says she\u2019d be upset if her daughter\u2019s private information was compromised.",
      "\u201cAt the same time,\u201d she said, \u201cI would like to avoid a school shooting or suicide.\u201d",
      "Gaggle uses a machine-learning algorithm to scan what students search or write online via a school-issued laptop or tablet 24 hours a day, or whenever they log into their school account on a personal device. The latest contract Vancouver signed, in summer 2024, shows a price of $328,036 for three school years \u2014 approximately the cost of employing one extra counselor.",
      "The algorithm detects potential indicators of problems like bullying, self-harm, suicide or school violence and then sends a screenshot to human reviewers. If Gaggle employees confirm the issue might be serious, the company alerts the school. In cases of imminent danger, Gaggle calls school officials directly. In rare instances where no one answers, Gaggle may contact law enforcement for a welfare check.",
      "A Vancouver school counselor who requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation said they receive three or four student Gaggle alerts per month. In about half the cases, the district contacts parents immediately.",
      "\u201cA lot of times, families don\u2019t know. We open that door for that help,\u201d the counselor said. Gaggle is \u201cgood for catching suicide and self-harm, but students find a workaround once they know they are getting flagged.\u201d",
      "Seattle Times and AP reporters saw what kind of writing set off Gaggle\u2019s alerts after requesting information about the type of content flagged. Gaggle saved screenshots of activity that set off each alert, and school officials accidentally provided links to them, not realizing they weren\u2019t protected by a password.",
      "After learning about the records inadvertently released to reporters, Gaggle updated its system. Now, after 72 hours, only those logged into a Gaggle account can view the screenshots. Gaggle said this feature was already in the works but had not yet been rolled out to every customer.",
      "The company says the links must be accessible without a login during those 72 hours so emergency contacts \u2014 who often receive these alerts late at night on their phones \u2014 can respond quickly.",
      "In Vancouver, the monitoring technology flagged more than 1,000 documents for suicide and nearly 800 for threats of violence. While many alerts were serious, many others turned out to be false alarms, like a student essay about the importance of consent or a goofy chat between friends.",
      "Foster\u2019s daughter Bryn, a Vancouver School of Arts and Academics sophomore, was one such false alarm. She was called into the principal\u2019s office after writing a short story featuring a scene with mildly violent imagery.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m glad they\u2019re being safe about it, but I also think it can be a bit much,\u201d Bryn said.",
      "School officials maintain alerts are warranted even in less severe cases or false alarms, ensuring potential issues are addressed promptly.",
      "\u201cIt allows me the opportunity to meet with a student I maybe haven\u2019t met before and build that relationship,\u201d said Chele Pierce, a Skyview High School counselor.",
      "Between October 2023 and October 2024, nearly 2,200 students, about 10% of the district\u2019s enrollment, were the subject of a Gaggle alert. At the Vancouver School of Arts and Academics, where Bryn is a student, about 1 in 4 students had communications that triggered a Gaggle alert.",
      "While schools continue to use surveillance technology, its long-term effects on student safety are unclear. There\u2019s no independent research showing it measurably lowers student suicide rates or reduces violence.",
      "A 2023 RAND study found only \u201cscant evidence\u201d of either benefits or risks from AI surveillance, concluding: \u201cNo research to date has comprehensively examined how these programs affect youth suicide prevention.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t have the right number of mental health counselors, issuing more alerts is not actually going to improve suicide prevention,\u201d said report co-author Benjamin Boudreaux, an AI ethics researcher.",
      "In the screenshots released by Vancouver schools, at least six students were potentially outed to school officials after writing about being gay, transgender or struggling with gender dysphoria.",
      "LGBTQ+ students are more likely than their peers to suffer from depression and suicidal thoughts, and turn to the internet for support.",
      "\u201cWe know that gay youth, especially those in more isolated environments, absolutely use the internet as a life preserver,\u201d said Katy Pearce, a University of Washington professor who researches technology in authoritarian states.",
      "In one screenshot, a Vancouver high schooler wrote in a Google survey form they\u2019d been subject to trans slurs and racist bullying. Who created this survey is unclear, but the person behind it had falsely promised confidentiality: \u201cI am not a mandated reporter, please tell me the whole truth.\u201d",
      "When North Carolina\u2019s Durham Public Schools piloted Gaggle in 2021, surveys showed most staff members found it helpful.",
      "But community members raised concerns. An LGBTQ+ advocate reported to the Board of Education that a Gaggle alert about self-harm had led to a student being outed to their family, who were not supportive.",
      "Glenn Thompson, a Durham School of the Arts graduate, spoke up at a board meeting during his senior year. One of his teachers promised a student confidentiality for an assignment related to mental health. A classmate was then \u201cblindsided\u201d when Gaggle alerted school officials about something private they\u2019d disclosed. Thompson said no one in the class, including the teacher, knew the school was piloting Gaggle.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t just (surveil) people and not tell them. That\u2019s a horrible breach of security and trust,\u201d said Thompson, now a college student, in an interview.",
      "After hearing about these experiences, the Durham Board of Education voted to stop using Gaggle in 2023. The district ultimately decided it was not worth the risk of outing students or eroding relationships with adults.",
      "The debate over privacy and security is complicated, and parents are often unaware it\u2019s even an issue. Pearce, the University of Washington professor, doesn\u2019t remember reading about Securly, the surveillance software Seattle Public Schools uses, when she signed the district\u2019s responsible use form before her son received a school laptop.",
      "Even when families learn about school surveillance, they may be unable to opt out. Owasso Public Schools in Oklahoma has used Gaggle since 2016 to monitor students outside of class.",
      "For years, Tim Reiland, the parent of two teenagers, had no idea the district was using Gaggle. He found out only after asking if his daughter could bring her personal laptop to school instead of being forced to use a district one because of privacy concerns.",
      "The district refused Reiland\u2019s request.",
      "When Reiland's daughter, Zoe, found out about Gaggle, she says she felt so \u201cfreaked out\u201d that she stopped Googling anything personal on her Chromebook, even questions about her menstrual period. She didn\u2019t want to get called into the office for \u201csearching up lady parts.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was too scared to be curious,\u201d she said.",
      "School officials say they don\u2019t track metrics measuring the technology\u2019s efficacy but believe it has saved lives.",
      "Yet technology alone doesn\u2019t create a safe space for all students. In 2024, a nonbinary teenager at Owasso High School named Nex Benedict died by suicide after relentless bullying from classmates. A subsequent U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights investigation found the district responded with \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to some families\u2019 reports of sexual harassment, mainly in the form of homophobic bullying.",
      "During the 2023-24 school year, the Owasso schools received close to 1,000 Gaggle alerts, including 168 alerts for harassment and 281 for suicide.",
      "When asked why bullying remained a problem despite surveillance, Russell Thornton, the district\u2019s executive director of technology responded: \u201cThis is one tool used by administrators. Obviously, one tool is not going to solve the world\u2019s problems and bullying.\u201d",
      "Despite the risks, surveillance technology can help teachers intervene before a tragedy.",
      "A middle school student in the Seattle-area Highline School District who was potentially being trafficked used Gaggle to communicate with campus staff, said former Superintendent Susan Enfield.",
      "\u201cThey knew that the staff member was reading what they were writing,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cIt was, in essence, that student\u2019s way of asking for help.\u201d",
      "Still, developmental psychology research shows it is vital for teens to have private spaces online to explore their thoughts and seek support.",
      "\u201cThe idea that kids are constantly under surveillance by adults \u2014 I think that would make it hard to develop a private life, a space to make mistakes, a space to go through hard feelings without adults jumping in,\u201d said Boudreaux, the AI ethics researcher.",
      "Gaggle\u2019s Patterson says school-issued devices are not the appropriate place for unlimited self-exploration. If that exploration takes a dark turn, such as making a threat, \u201cthe school\u2019s going to be held liable,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for that open free expression, it really can\u2019t happen on the school system\u2019s computers.\u201d",

      "NASA\u2019s newest space telescope rocketed into orbit Tuesday to map the entire sky like never before \u2014 a sweeping look at hundreds of millions of galaxies and their shared cosmic glow since the beginning of time.",
      "SpaceX launched the Spherex observatory from California, putting it on course to fly over Earth\u2019s poles. Tagging along were four suitcase-size satellites to study the sun. Spherex popped off the rocket's upper stage first, drifting into the blackness of space with a blue Earth in the background.",
      "The $488 million Spherex mission aims to explain how galaxies formed and evolved over billions of years, and how the universe expanded so fast in its first moments.",
      "Closer to home in our own Milky Way galaxy, Spherex will hunt for water and other ingredients of life in the icy clouds between stars where new solar systems emerge.",
      "The cone-shaped Spherex \u2014 at 1,110 pounds (500 kilograms) or the heft of a grand piano \u2014 will take six months to map the entire sky with its infrared eyes and wide field of view. Four full-sky surveys are planned over two years, as the telescope circles the globe from pole to pole 400 miles (650 kilometers) up.",
      "Spherex won\u2019t see galaxies in exquisite detail like NASA\u2019s larger and more elaborate Hubble and Webb space telescopes, with their narrow fields of view.",
      "Instead of counting galaxies or focusing on them, Spherex will observe the total glow produced by the whole lot, including the earliest ones formed in the wake of the universe-creating Big Bang.",
      "\u201cThis cosmological glow captures all light emitted over cosmic history,\u201d said the mission\u2019s chief scientist Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology. \u201cIt\u2019s a very different way of looking at the universe,\u201d enabling scientists to see what sources of light may have been missed in the past.",
      "By observing the collective glow, scientists hope to tease out the light from the earliest galaxies and learn how they came to be, Bock said.",
      "\u201cWe won\u2019t see the Big Bang. But we\u2019ll see the aftermath from it and learn about the beginning of the universe that way,\u201d he said.",
      "The telescope\u2019s infrared detectors will be able to distinguish 102 colors invisible to the human eye, yielding the most colorful, inclusive map ever made of the cosmos.",

It sports three aluminum-honeycomb cones, one inside the other, to protect from the sun and Earth's heat, resembling a 10-foot (3-meter) shield collar for an ailing dog.",
      "Besides the telescope, SpaceX\u2019s Falcon rocket provided a lift from Vandenberg Space Force Base for a quartet of NASA satellites called Punch. From their own separate polar orbit, the satellites will observe the sun\u2019s corona, or outer atmosphere, and the resulting solar wind.",

      "Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin on Wednesday announced nearly three dozen deregulatory moves that he said would spur the U.S. economy by rolling back rules that have unfairly burdened industry. Many of the moves would affect landmark regulations aimed at protecting clean air and water.",
      "Industry generally applauded the proposed changes, while environmentalists worried about what would amount to historic rollbacks if they are approved. Here's a look at some of the 31 regulatory changes Zeldin announced:",
      "The Biden administration set limits on planet-warming emissions from existing gas and coal-fired power plants \u2013 a major step in the administration\u2019s effort to reduce greenhouse gases from the heavily polluting energy sector. Trump has long opposed such tough, climate-friendly limits and has instead promoted oil and gas development. Zeldin said the agency would reconsider the Biden administration standards to avoid constraining energy production.",
      "Coal plants emit toxic metals like mercury and the Biden administration issued a rule to severely limit those pollutants. Officials at the time said technology had progressed enough for these plants to do better. The EPA on Wednesday said nearly two dozen states had sued, arguing the rule was costly and a major burden, especially to coal plants. They also considering offering industry a two-year compliance extension while officials reconsider the rule.",
      "Hazardous metals like mercury and arsenic end up in the wastewater of steam-powered electric generating power plants like coal. These can have serious health effects including increasing cancer rates and lowering childhood IQ scores. The Biden administration tightened regulations of this wastewater. The EPA said it will revisit those \u201cstringent\u201d rules that are costly to industry and therefore may raise residential energy bills.",
      "Currently, treated wastewater generated from oil and gas drilling can be used in limited ways in certain western lands, such as for agriculture. Environmentalists say there can be a broad range of contaminants in the wastewater, some of which might not be known. The EPA said it will reconsider those rules and look at how the treated water could be used for other purposes like cooling data centers, fighting fires and other ecological needs. They say the current rules are costly, old and don\u2019t reflect the capabilities of modern treatment technologies.",
      "The Biden administration tightened safeguards against accidents for industrial and chemical plants that millions of people live near. The agency\u2019s risk management program added planning and reporting requirements for facilities and forced some to implement new safeguards. Accidents at these plants can be severe \u2013 a 2019 explosion at a Texas facility, for example, forced tens of thousands to evacuate, for example. Industry associations have criticized parts of the rule, such as requirements to publicly report sensitive information.",
      "Zeldin said Biden administration officials \u201cignored recommendations from national security experts on how their rule makes chemical and other sensitive facilities in America more vulnerable to attack.\u201d The EPA is reconsidering the rule.",
      "The EPA said it was reconsidering its mandatory greenhouse gas reporting program, which requires thousands of major industrial polluters to tell the agency about its emissions. Zeldin said the \u201cbureaucratic government program\u201d costs hundreds of millions of dollars and doesn\u2019t help air quality. Until now, the EPA said the data helped businesses compare their emissions to competitors and find opportunities to reduce them and lower costs.",
      "Zeldin vowed to review his agency\u2019s emissions standards for cars and trucks, calling the tightened emissions rules the \u201cfoundation for the Biden-Harris electric vehicle mandate.\u201d Nothing the Biden administration implemented required automakers to make and sell EVs or for consumers to buy them. Loosening standards would allow vehicles to emit more planet-warming greenhouse gases, but many automakers have already been investing in making their vehicles more efficient.",
      "The scientific finding, under the 2009 Clean Air Act, determined that planet-warming greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. It has been at the core of the nation\u2019s action against climate change. Trump had already directed the EPA to consider the finding\u2019s \u201clegality\u201d in an executive order. Experts say the impacts of climate change on human health and the environment are already clear, and that upending the finding would be devastating.",
      "This program enforced strict rules to reduce the use of hydrofluorocarbons, highly potent and planet-warming greenhouse gases used in refrigerators, air conditioners, heat pumps and more. HFCs, as they are known, are thousands of times more powerful than carbon dioxide and leak through equipment that uses compressed refrigerants. Dozens of countries around the globe have pledged to slash their use and production of the chemicals.",
      "This rule was intended to limit air pollution by restricting power plant smokestack emissions, and those from other industrial sites, across 11 states. Eliminating it would especially impact downwind neighborhoods that are burdened by pollution from ground-level ozone, or smog, that is out of their control. However, the Supreme Court had already put a hold on the rule last summer, ruling that states challenging it were likely to prevail.",
      "These seats have long been politicized given how influential they can be in setting national environmental policy. The board reviews \u201cthe quality and relevance of the scientific and technical information being used by the EPA or proposed as the basis for Agency regulations\u201d and agency research programs. Congress directed the agency to establish the board to provide the Administrator science advice in 1978. The committee can give \u201cindependent advice\u201d to the agency\u2019s Administrator specific to the nation\u2019s Ambient Air Quality Standards.",
      "Power plants and industrial facilities release particulate matter, or soot, that can easily pass through a person\u2019s lungs and into their bloodstream. Last year, the Biden administration tightened standards regulating soot in response to scientific research indicating existing regulations were insufficient. At the time, the EPA estimated its stronger regulations would save thousands of lives and prevent hundreds of thousands of cases of asthma and lost workdays annually. The Trump administration\u2019s EPA says these regulations are \u201ca major obstacle\u201d for companies and that the U.S. has low levels of soot.",
      "These EPA standards apply to pollutants known or suspected to cause cancer, birth defects or other serious health problems. Industrial facilities are required to follow strict standards to monitor and limit the amount of these chemicals they release into the air. Last year, the EPA tightened standards surrounding ethylene oxide emissions, a human carcinogen commonly used as a sterilizer for medical equipment. The Trump administration said it is considering a \u201c2-year compliance exemption\u201d for facilities affected by these standards, among others.",
      "For decades, this EPA program has required states to reduce pollution that threatens scenic views in more than 150 national parks and wilderness areas, including in the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone. Zeldin said that the U.S. has made strides in improving visibility in national parks and that the program is being used as justification for shutting down industrial facilities and threatening affordable energy.",
      "The social cost of carbon is an EPA tool to weigh the economic costs and benefits of regulating polluting industries by putting a price tag on climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions \u2013 set at $190 per ton under the Biden administration\u2019s EPA. That calculation is used in cost-benefit analyses, and was intended to account for greenhouse gas emissions\u2019 impacts including natural disasters, crop damage, health problems and sea-level rise. Under the first Trump administration, carbon was pegged at around $5 per ton.

The EPA says it is now seeking to rapidly put regulation \u201cmore fully into state hands,\u201d which environmental groups fear could lead to weaker standards. Last year, the Biden administration closed a gap that had allowed companies to avoid responsibility for cleaning up inactive coal ash pits \u2013 a policy that environmental groups say could now be repealed.",

    "story": [
      "Japanese automaker Nissan says its chief executive, Makoto Uchida, is stepping down",
      "TOKYO -- Japanese automaker Nissan's chief executive, Makoto Uchida, is stepping down after the company reported dismal financial results and its merger talks with Honda collapsed.",
      "Nissan Motor Corp. said in a statement Tuesday that Ivan Espinosa, who is now the company\u2019s chief planning officer, will take Uchida\u2019s place, effective April 1.",
      "Nissan stock edged up slightly at the opening but soon slipped about 1% in early Wednesday trading in Tokyo, highlighting investors' skepticism over what was announced late the previous day.",
      "Espinosa, who joined Nissan in 2003, has spent much of his Nissan career in Mexico and Southeast Asia, overseeing product planning including the drive toward electric vehicles, meaning he's an insider perhaps less willing to take drastic action.",
      "\u201cI sincerely believe that Nissan has so much more potential than what we're seeing today,\u201d Espinosa told reporters, while stressing that he needs time to come up with details for a turnaround.",
      "He stressed his love for Nissan, noting he has developed a deep understanding of what makes the company unique and valuable.",
      "Nissan said the company leadership needed to be \u201crenewed\u201d to achieve long-term growth. Uchida, who remains as a director, expressed confidence in Espinosa as \u201ca real car guy,\u201d and stressed he was handing over the baton of leadership to better unify company ranks.",
      "\u201cI am confident that Nissan will definitely make a comeback,\u201d he said, appearing at the hastily called news conference with Espinosa.",
      "Speculation about Uchida's future was rife after he called off talks last month with Japanese rival Honda Motor Co., announced late last year, to set up a joint holding company to integrate their businesses. At the time, he told reporters the focus of the talks had changed to making Nissan into a Honda subsidiary, which he denounced as unacceptable.",
      "He also said their strategic partnership to realize synergies on specific projects like electric vehicles and other research will continue.",
      "Nissan is projecting a loss of 80 billion yen ($540 million) for the full fiscal year through the end of this month.",
      "When asked about talks with Honda and other possible partnerships, Espinosa declined comment, saying he needed more time.",
      "During Uchida\u2019s more than five years at Nissan\u2019s helm, sales faltered, including in key markets like the U.S. and China. Uchida also earlier announced the company was slashing 9,000 jobs.",
      "Analysts said Nissan's future remains precarious, with little time left, but noted Nissan may need an outsider rather than an insider like Espinosa.",
      "Todd Duvick and Will Lee, auto analysts at CreditSights, believe the focus is still on a business turnaround, not the proposed integration with Honda.",
      "\u201cNot that a turnaround could not coexist with a Honda merger, but we view it as unlikely that Nissan would be open to becoming a subsidiary of Honda at this time, at least until the board has time to assess the effectiveness of Espinosa\u2019s strategy once it is unveiled and put into action,\u201d they said in a report.",
      "It\u2019s a sad turn for the maker of the Z sportscar, loved by auto buffs around the world, and the Leaf electric car, a pioneer in that sector that launched in 2010. Besides its proud legacy, Nissan also boasts solid engineering. It recently showed off its autonomous vehicle running on regular streets near its Yokohama headquarters.",
      "Uchida joined Nissan in 2003, job-hopping from major Japanese trading company Nissho Iwai, and worked with Nissan\u2019s alliance partner Renault SA of France before overseeing Nissan\u2019s China operations.",
      "Nissan was rescued from near bankruptcy by Renault in 1999. In 2018, Carlos Ghosn, the former superstar executive sent in by Renault, was arrested by Japanese authorities on various financial misconduct charges, including under-reporting his compensation. He later fled to Lebanon, which has no extradition treaty with Japan.",
      "Nissan's tarnished corporate image after the Ghosn fiasco was a major challenge, Uchida said. So were the COVID-19 pandemic and broader shifts in the auto industry.",
      "Apart from Uchida's departure as chief executive, Nissan announced other sweeping managerial changes, including giving an expanded role to Guillaume Cartier, its chief performance officer, in global marketing and customer experience.",
      "Eiichi Akashi, corporate vice president of the Vehicle Planning and Vehicle Component Engineering Division, was named chief technology officer, succeeding Kunio Nakaguro.",
      "Teiji Hirata, a corporate vice president, will become chief \u201cmonozukuri\u201d officer and executive officer, responsible for manufacturing and supply chain management, replacing Hideyuki Sakamoto.",
      "Jeremy Papin, the chief financial officer, was also appointed to be an executive officer. There was no change for Stephen Ma, who serves as chairperson of Nissan's management committee in China.",

      "In less than a month, TikTok could have one or a few new owners, be banned again, or simply receive another reprieve to continue operating in the United States.",
      "Questions about the fate of the popular video sharing app have continued to linger since a law requiring its China-based parent company to divest or face a ban took effect on Jan. 19. After taking office, President Donald Trump gave TikTok a 75-day reprieve by signing an executive order that delayed enforcement of the statute until April 5.",
      "As he returned to Washington from his Florida home on Sunday, Trump told reporters that a deal could come soon. He did not offer any details on the interested buyers, but said the administration was in talks with \u201cfour different groups\u201d about TikTok.",
      "\u201cA lot of people want it and it\u2019s up to me,\u201d Trump said aboard Air Force One.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment.",
      "If TikTok is not sold to an approved buyer by April 5, the original law that bans it nationwide would once again go into effect. However, the deadline for the executive order doesn't appear to be set in stone and the president has reiterated it could be extended further if needed.",
      "Trump\u2019s order came a few days after the Supreme Court unanimously upheld a federal law that required TikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance, to divest or be banned in January. The day after the ruling, TikTok went dark for U.S. users and came back online after Trump vowed to stall the ban.",
      "During his first term, Trump tried to ban TikTok on national security grounds, which was halted by the courts before his administration negotiated a sale of the platform that eventually failed to materialize. He changed his position on the popular app during last year's presidential election and has credited the platform with helping him win more young voters.",
      "The decision to keep TikTok alive through an executive order has received some scrutiny, but it has not faced a legal challenge in court.",
      "Although it\u2019s unclear if ByteDance plans to sell TikTok, several potential bidders have come forward in the past few months.",
      "Aides for Vice President JD Vance, who was tapped to oversee a potential deal, have reached out to some parties, such as the artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI, to get additional details about their bids, according to a person familiar with the matter. In January, Perplexity AI presented ByteDance with a merger proposal that would combine Perplexity\u2019s business with TikTok\u2019s U.S. operation.",
      "Other potential bidders include a consortium organized by billionaire businessman Frank McCourt, which recently recruited Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian as a strategic advisor. Investors in the consortium say they\u2019ve offered ByteDance $20 billion in cash for TikTok\u2019s U.S. platform. And if successful, they plan to redesign the popular app with blockchain technology they say will provide users with more control over their online data.",
      "Jesse Tinsley, the founder of the payroll firm Employer.com, says he too has organized a consortium, which includes the CEO of the video game platform Roblox, and is offering ByteDance more than $30 billion for TikTok.",
      "Trump said in January that Microsoft was also eyeing the popular app. Other interested parties include Trump\u2019s former Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin and Rumble, the video site popular with some conservatives and far-right groups. In a post on X last March, Rumble said it was ready to join a consortium of parties interested in purchasing TikTok and serving as a tech partner for the company.",
      "Trump has said he is looking to have the U.S. government broker a deal for 50% control of TikTok. However, the administration hasn't provided details on what exactly that would entail, or what role the U.S. government could play in the future of the short-form video app.",
      "Some potential bidders have floated proposals that would allow the U.S. to invest or own a stake in the platform. Last month, Trump himself also said the U.S. could own part of TikTok through a new government-owned investment fund.",
      "Chinese officials, who would have to approve the deal, appear to have softened their stance on the issue compared to last year when Beijing called the push for divestment a \u201crobbers\u201d act.",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said in January that business operations and acquisitions \u201cshould be independently decided by companies in accordance with market principles.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf it involves Chinese companies, China\u2019s laws and regulations should be observed,\u201d Mao said.",
      "If ByteDance sits down to negotiate, the company would likely need to iron out major details with the U.S. over the proprietary algorithm that populates TikTok feeds as well as the flow of content between the U.S. and the rest of the world.",

      "Explorers have discovered the sunken wreckage of one of the first steel cargo ships to travel the Great Lakes",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Twenty years before the Titanic changed maritime history, another ship touted as the next great technological feat set sail on the Great Lakes.",
      "The Western Reserve was one of the first all-steel cargo ships to traverse the lakes. Built to break speed records, the 300-foot (91.4-meter) freighter dubbed \u201cthe inland greyhound\u201d by newspapers was supposed to be one of the safest ships afloat. Owner Peter Minch was so proud of her that he brought his wife and young children aboard for a summer joyride in August 1892.",
      "Then tragedy struck. As the ship entered Lake Superior's Whitefish Bay between Michigan and Canada on Aug. 30, a gale came up. With no cargo aboard, the ship was light and floating high in the water. The storm battered it until it cracked in half. Twenty-seven people perished that night, including the Minch family. The only survivor was wheelsman Harry W. Stewart, who swam a mile (1.6 kilometers) to shore after his lifeboat capsized.",
      "For almost 132 years the lake hid the wreckage. In July, explorers from the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society pinpointed the Western Reserve off Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The society announced the discovery Saturday at the annual Ghost Ships Festival in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. Executive Director Bruce Lynn called the discovery one of the society's most significant finds.",
      "\u201cThere's a number of concurrent stories that make this important,\u201d Lynn said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. \u201cMost ships were still wooden. It was a technologically advanced ship. They were kind of a famous family at the time. You have this new ship, considered one of the safest on the lake, new tech, a big, big ship. (The discovery) is another way for us to keep this history alive.\u201d",
      "Darryl Ertel, the society's marine operations director, and his brother, Dan Ertel, spent more than two years looking for the Western Reserve.",
      "Lynn said this winter the brothers outlined a search grid. On July 22 they set out on the David Boyd, the society's research vessel. Heavy ship traffic that day forced them to alter their course, though, and search an area adjacent to their original grid, Lynn said.",
      "The brothers towed a side-scanning sonar array behind their ship. Side sonar scans to starboard and port, providing a more expansive picture of the bottom than traditional sonar mounted beneath a ship. About 60 miles (97 kilometers) northwest of Whitefish Point on the Upper Peninsula, they picked up a line with a shadow behind it in 600 feet of water. They dialed up the resolution and spotted a ship broken in two with the bow resting on the stern. Each section was 150 feet (45.2 meters) long, suggesting they'd found the Western Reserve.",
      "Eight days later, the brothers returned to the site along with Lynn. They deployed a submersible drone equipped with high-intensity lighting and a high-resolution camera. The drone returned clear images of a portside running light that match the Western Reserve's starboard running light, which had washed ashore in Canada after the ship went down. That light was the only artifact recovered from the ship.",
      "\u201cThat was confirmation day,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cIt's pretty exciting.\u201d",
      "Darryl Ertel said that discovery gave him chills \u2014 and not in a good way. \u201cKnowing how the 300-foot Western Reserve was caught in a storm this far from shore made a uneasy feeling in the back of my neck,\" he said in a society news release. \"A squall can come up unexpectedly\u2026anywhere, and anytime.\u201d",
      "The Edmund Fitzgerald, a freighter that went down in a November 1975 storm that was immortalized in the Gordon Lightfoot song, \u201cThe Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,\" sank off Whitefish Point within 100 miles of the Western Reserve. There were no survivors."

      "OKUMA, Japan -- The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant's radiation levels have significantly dropped since the cataclysmic meltdown 14 years ago Tuesday. Workers walk around in many areas wearing only surgical masks and regular clothes.",
      "It's a different story for those who enter the reactor buildings, including the three damaged in the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. They must use maximum protection \u2014 full facemasks with filters, multi-layered gloves and socks, shoe covers, hooded hazmat coveralls and a waterproof jacket, and a helmet.",
      "As workers remove melted fuel debris from the reactors in a monumental nuclear cleanup effort that could take more than a century, they are facing both huge amounts of psychological stress and dangerous levels of radiation.",
      "The Associated Press, which recently visited the plant for a tour and interviews, takes a closer look.",
      "A remote-controlled extendable robot with a tong had several mishaps including equipment failures before returning in November with a tiny piece of melted fuel from inside the damaged No. 2 reactor.",
      "That first successful test run is a crucial step in what will be a daunting, decades-long decommissioning that must deal with at least 880 tons of melted nuclear fuel that has mixed with broken parts of internal structures and other debris inside the three ruined reactors.",
      "Akira Ono, chief decommissioning officer at the Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, which manages the plant, says even the tiny sample gives officials a lot of information about the melted fuel. More samples are needed, however, to make the work smoother when bigger efforts to remove the debris begin in the 2030s.",
      "A second sample-retrieval mission at the No. 2 reactor is expected in coming weeks.",
      "Operators hope to send the extendable robot farther into the reactor to take samples closer to the center, where overheated nuclear fuel fell from the core, utility spokesperson Masakatsu Takata said. He pointed out the target area as he stood inside the inner structure of the No. 5 reactor, which is one of two reactors that survived the tsunami. It has an identical design as No. 2.",
      "Radiation levels are still dangerously high inside the No. 2 reactor building, where the melted fuel debris is behind a thick concrete containment wall. Earlier decontamination work reduced those radiation levels to a fraction of what they used to be.",
      "In late August, small groups took turns doing their work helping the robot in 15- to 30-minute shifts to minimize radiation exposure. They have a remotely controlled robot, but it has to be manually pushed in and out.",
      "\u201cWorking under high levels of radiation (during a short) time limit made us feel nervous and rushed,\" said Yasunobu Yokokawa, a team leader for the mission. \"It was a difficult assignment.\u201d",
      "Full-face masks reduced visibility and made breathing difficult, an extra waterproof jacket made it sweaty and hard to move, and triple-layered gloves made their fingers clumsy, Yokokawa said.",
      "To eliminate unnecessary exposure, they taped around gloves and socks and carried a personal dosimeter to measure radiation. Workers also rehearsed the tasks they'd perform to minimize exposure.",
      "The mission stalled early on when workers noticed that a set of five 1.5-meter (5-foot) pipes meant to push the robot into the reactor's primary containment vessel had been arranged in the wrong order.",
      "A camera on the robot also failed because of high radioactivity and had to be replaced.",
      "The workers' highest individual radiation dose was more than the overall average but still far below anything approaching a 100-millisievert five-year dose limit.",
      "Even so, a growing number of workers are concerned about safety and radiation at the plant, said Ono, the decommissioning chief, citing an annual survey of about 5,5,00 workers.",
      "In 2023, two workers splashed with contaminated sludge at a water treatment facility suffered burns and were hospitalized, though they had no other health problems.",
      "Yokokawa and a plant colleague, Hiroshi Ide, helped in the 2011 emergency and work as team leaders today. They say they want to make the job safer as workers face high radiation in parts of the plant.",
      "On the top floor of the No. 2 reactor, workers are setting up equipment to remove spent fuel units from the cooling pool. That's set to begin within two to three years.",
      "At the No. 1 reactor, workers are putting up a giant roof to contain radioactive dust from decontamination work on the top floor ahead of the removal of spent fuel.",
      "To minimize exposure and increase efficiency, workers use a remote-controlled crane to attach pre-assembled parts, according to TEPCO. The No. 1 reactor and its surroundings are among the most contaminated parts of the plant.",
      "Workers are also removing treated radioactive wastewater. They recently started dismantling the emptied water tanks to make room to build facilities needed for the research and storage of melted fuel debris.",
      "After a series of small missions by robots to gather samples, experts will determine a larger-scale method for removing melted fuel, first at the No. 3 reactor.",
      "Experts say the hard work and huge challenges of decommissioning the plant are just beginning. There are estimations that the work could take more than a century. The government and TEPCO have an initial completion target of 2051, but the retrieval of melted fuel debris is already three years behind, and many big issues remain undecided.",
      "Ide, whose home in Namie town, northwest of the plant, is in a no-go zone because of nuclear contamination, still has to put on a hazmat suit, even for brief visits home.",

      "HONOLULU -- An erupting Hawaii volcano once again began shooting fountains of lava that reached hundreds of feet high on Tuesday.",
      "Fountains reached heights of 400 feet (120 meters) to 500 feet (150 meters) in the early morning hours, according to the U.S. Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory.",
      "This marks the 13th episode of on-again, off-again lava activity of Kilauea volcano on the Big Island that started Dec. 23.",
      "The latest episode didn't last long. Fountaining stopped abruptly in the afternoon, scientists later said.",
      "A webcam showed vigorous fountains of bright-red molten rock and billowing smoke midmorning Tuesday. Hours later, only smoke could be seen.",
      "On Monday afternoon, there were small, sporadic spatter fountains reaching 15 feet (5 meters) to 30 feet (10 meters) high. Spattering continued to increase during the night and into early Tuesday, the observatory said in a status report.",
      "No residential areas have been threatened by the eruption. People have been flocking to the park for views of the fiery show.",
      "Each episode has produced fountains ranging in height, with some reaching 600 feet (180 meters).",
      "The length of time for each fountaining episode has varied from several hours to several days. Episodes have been separated by pauses lasting from less than 24 hours to 12 days, according to the observatory."

      "Struggling chipmaker Intel has hired former board member and semiconductor industry veteran Lip-Bu Tan as the latest in a succession of CEOs to attempt to turn around a once-dominant company that helped define Silicon Valley.",
      "Tan, 65, will take over the daunting job next Tuesday, more than three months after Intel's previous CEO, Pat Gelsinger, abruptly retired amid a deepening downturn that triggered massive layoffs and raised questions about the chipmaker's ability to survive as an independent company.",
      "This won't be Tan's first time running a semiconductor company, nor his first association with Intel. He spent more than a decade as CEO of Cadence Design Systems, which makes software that helps designs processors, and joined Intel's board of directors in 2022 before stepping down last August. Tan will rejoin Intel's board in addition to becoming CEO.",
      "\u201cLip-Bu is an exceptional leader whose technology industry expertise, deep relationships across the product and foundry ecosystems, and proven track record of creating shareholder value is exactly what Intel needs in its next CEO,\u201d Intel's interim Executive Chairman Frank Yeary said.",
      "Intel has been led by interim co-CEOs, David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus, since Gelsinger walked away from a job that he undertook in February 2021.",
      "Although Gelsinger arrived at Intel amid high hopes, his tenure was a major letdown as Intel's stock price plunged 60%, wiping out $160 billion in shareholder wealth. Leading up to his departure last year, Intel laid of 17,500 of its employees \u2014 about 15% of its workforce \u2014 and suspended its dividend to save money on its way to an annual loss of $19 billion.",
      "More recently, Intel delayed the opening of two new chip factories i n Ohio to ensure the projects are completed in a \u201cfinancially responsible manner.\u201d The project is supposed to draw upon the $7.8 billion in funding earmarked for Intel in the CHIPS Incentives Program created during the administration of President Joe Biden.",
      "It was the latest sign of distress for Intel, a Santa Clara, California, company that helped launch Silicon Valley by developing the microprocessors that enabled the personal computer revolution under the leadership of its CEO at that time, Andy Grove.",
      "But as its leadership changed Intel missed the technological shift to mobile computing triggered by Apple's 2007 release of the iPhone, and it's lagged more nimble chipmakers. Intel's troubles have been magnified since the advent of artificial intelligence \u2014 a booming field where the chips made by once-smaller rival Nvidia have become tech's hottest commodity.",
      "Nvida now boasts a market value of $2.8 trillion compared to Intel's $90 billion. Intel's stock price rose more than 10% in Wednesday's extended trading after Tan's hiring was announced, indicating investors believe he will revive the company's fortunes.",
      "While Tan was Cadence Design's CEO from January 2009 to May 2021, the company's stock price increased by 44-fold.",
      "Tan's past accomplishments resulted him being named winner of the Semiconductor Industry Association's 2022 Robert Noyce Award \u2014 an honor named after one of Intel's co-founders."

      "A military court-martial convened this week at Hanscom Air Force Base in Massachusetts on charges alleging Teixeira violated the Uniform Code of Military Justice.",
      "Teixeira pleaded guilty to the obstruction charge at the court-martial on Thursday, his family spokesperson confirmed. A second charge of disobeying orders was dropped as part of a plea agreement, which calls for dishonorable discharge and no confinement, according to the spokesperson.",
      "Teixeira said he shared classified information with the public in a \"brief moment of regret,\" though he largely defended his actions and called himself a \"proud American and a patriot\" in remarks to the court ahead of his sentencing.",
      "\"It was my intent to expose and correct the lies manufactured and perpetuated by the Biden administration and force-fed to the American people by the mainstream media,\" he said, according to a statement obtained by ABC News.",
      "He said a \"fraud was being perpetuated upon the American people\" regarding the conflict between Ukraine and Russia and he \"obstructed justice only to protect the people who now know the truth about a fraudulent Biden presidency.\"",
      "\"If I saved even one American, Russian or Ukrainian life against a senseless money-grab war, it was worth the punishment,\" he said.",
      "Teixeira further claimed the Department of Justice \"was politicized and used as a weapon\" against him and President Donald Trump, and he asked the administration to review his convictions.",
      "\"I knowingly made choices to inform the American public and open their eyes,\" he said. \"I did so fully willing to accept the repercussions. I am comfortable with how history will remember me and my actions.\"",
      "Teixeira, who was previously sentenced to 15 years in prison on the federal charges, faced potentially another 10 years in custody for the obstruction charge.",
      "He was sentenced Thursday under the terms of the plea agreement, avoiding any further confinement time and getting a dishonorable discharge, according to Lt. Col. Peter Havern, the prosecutor in the military case.",
      "Havern said they are pleased with the sentence.",
      "\"The important thing for us was the dishonorable discharge,\" he told reporters following the proceedings. \"We wanted to reflect to our airmen and guardians, as well as to the public, that when you commit the crimes that he committed, that we need to accurately depict your service as a dishonorable service.\"",
      "\"I think it's an accurate, appropriate sentence,\" he added, calling a dishonorable discharge \"the most serious punitive discharge that the military can command.\"",
      "Teixeria currently remains an airman pending the outcome of an automatic appeals process in the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals, Havern said.",
      "Under the obstruction charge, the airman was accused of \"disposing of an iPad, computer hard drive, and cell phone, with intent to obstruct the due administration of justice in the case of himself\" sometime between March 1, 2023, and April 13, 2023, as well as directing another person to delete Discord messages he sent \"with intent to obstruct the due administration of justice in the case of himself\" on or about April 7, 2023.",
      "Teixeira, who worked as an information technology specialist, was convicted last year on federal charges, pleading guilty to six counts of willfully retaining and transmitting national defense information.",
      "He was sentenced in November 2024 to 15 years in prison, followed by three years of supervised release.",
      "The U.S. military reserves the right to separately prosecute a service member who has already been convicted in a federal court.",
      "An Air Force evidentiary hearing was held in May 2024 to determine whether his case should move forward to an Air Force court-martial.",
      "Federal prosecutors said Teixeira \"perpetrated one of the most significant and consequential violations of the Espionage Act in American history.\"",
      "According to the signed plea agreement filed with the federal court, Teixeira agreed to plead guilty to all six counts charging him with willful retention and transmission of national defense information. In exchange, prosecutors agreed not to charge him with additional counts under the Espionage Act.",
      "Teixeira \"accessed and printed hundreds of classified documents\" and posted images of them on Discord prior to his arrest in April 2023, a prosecutor said during the federal plea hearing last year. He has admitted in court to knowing the documents were marked classified.",
      "Teixeira enlisted in the Air National Guard in 2019, according to his service record. He had top-secret security clearance beginning in 2021 and began posting classified documents online in January 2022, according to the Department of Justice.",

    "story": [
      "His announcement comes as Democrats grapple with the future of the party.",
      "Former Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg announced Thursday morning that he will not run for U.S. Senate or governor in the state of Michigan, potentially clearing the way to possibly mount a run for president in 2028.",
      "\"I care deeply about who Michigan will elect as Governor and send to the U.S. Senate next year, but I have decided against competing in either race,\" Buttigieg wrote on X. \"I remain enthusiastic about helping candidates who share our values - and who understand that in this moment, leadership means not only opposing today's cruel chaos, but also presenting a vision of a better alternative.\"",
      "Buttigieg's announcement comes as Democrats grapple both with being locked out of power in Washington and the prospect of defending multiple key Senate seats in the 2026 midterms.",
      "A lot can happen between now and the next presidential race, but there is little doubt that's what the former secretary is gearing up for. A source familiar with Buttigieg's thinking said they believe this move puts him in the strongest possible position to run in 2028 and running for governor or senator in 2026 would have taken that off the table.",
      "Buttigieg was expected to potentially announce a run for the seat being vacated by incumbent Sen. Gary Peters, who announced in January that he would not run for reelection. Incumbent Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is term-limited.",
      "Buttigieg and his family had moved to Traverse City, Michigan, his husband Chasten's hometown, in 2022.",
      "In a post on Substack elaborating on his decision not to run for Senate or governor, Buttigieg wrote that he had been seriously considered running for either jobs.",
      "\"I've had long conversations with neighbors, advisors, friends, elected officials, and with Chasten about whether to run. I reflected on what I could offer in light of the exceptionally high standards of leadership and service set by Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Senator Debbie Stabenow, and Senator Gary Peters,\" Buttigieg wrote.",
      "\"I considered what I could bring to the race compared to other likely candidates, and what running and serving would mean compared to other ways I could make a difference in the years ahead.\"",
      "He said that the Democratic Party \"has a deep and talented bench here in Michigan, and I am certain that we will nominate an outstanding candidate for each office.\"",
      "Buttigieg did not mention any specific plans for the future or his own plans, he said, include talking to \"both legacy and digital media,\" talking with people around the Midwest, and \"engaging partners, allies, friends and strangers in the service of a more convincing and widespread account of American prosperity than either side has so far offered\" -- seemingly sending a dig at both the Republican Party and his own Democratic Party. He mentioned neither party by name.",
      "Without calling out President Donald Trump by name either, Buttigieg called the United States \"demonstrably less free, less secure, less democratic - and less prosperous - than it was just ten weeks ago,\" and said that people need to both show a positive vision of a \"better future\" for America and to be creative over \"where we make our case\" given that how Americans receive information has changed.",
      "Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, first rose to national prominence when he ran in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. He served in President Joe Biden's Cabinet as secretary of the Department of Transportation, becoming the first openly gay Cabinet secretary to be confirmed by the Senate.",
      "During Biden's 2024 presidential campaign -- and later, Vice President Kamala Harris's own campaign after Biden left the race -- Buttigieg served as a key campaign surrogate and was floated as a potential running mate for Harris, who ultimately chose Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.",
      "Buttigieg's decision comes as both the U.S. Senate and governor races in Michigan, a key battleground state, heat up.",
      "A few figures floated as potential Senate candidates have already indicated they will not run for the seat. But the field may be set to grow. Democratic Michigan state Sen. Mallory McMorrow wrote on X on Thursday morning, \"Busy morning, huh? Thank you to everyone encouraging me to run for Senate. I'll have more to share soon.\"",
      "The Cook Political Report currently rates the 2026 Michigan U.S. Senate race as a toss up. Michigan's other Senate seat, up for election in 2024, was narrowly won by Democratic candidate Elissa Slotkin even as Harris lost the state.",

      "The judge slammed the attorney representing the Justice Department for refusing to make OPM Acting Director Charles Ezell available for cross-examination and for withdrawing his sworn declaration, which the judge called a \"sham.\"",
      "\"The government, I believe, has tried to frustrate the judge's ability to get at the truth of what happened here, and then set forth sham declarations,\" he said. \"That's not the way it works in the U.S. District Court.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt slammed the judge in a statement Thursday afternoon vowing to \"immediately fight back against this absurd and unconstitutional order.\"",
      "\"If a federal district court judge would like executive powers, they can try and run for President themselves. The Trump Administration will immediately fight back against this absurd and unconstitutional order,\" she said in a statement.",

      "\"You will not bring the people in here to be cross-examined. You're afraid to do so, because, you know, cross-examination would reveal the truth. This is the U.S. District Court,\" he said. \"I tend to doubt that you're telling me the truth.\"",
      "If the Trump administration wants to reduce the size of the federal government, it would need to follow the process established in federal law, Alsup said.",
      "\"The words that I give you today should not be taken as some kind of wild and crazy judge in San Francisco has said that the administration cannot engage in a reduction-in-force,\" he said.",
      "\"The reason that OPM wanted to put this 'based on performance' was, at least in my judgment, a gimmick to avoid their Reduction in Force Act because the law always allows you to fire somebody for performance,\" Alsup said, adding that the employees terminated for \"performance\" can't even get unemployment insurance.",
      "The judge also criticized the government for submitting a declaration from Ezell he believed to be false, then withdrew it and made Ezell unavailable for testimony.",
      "\"You withdrew his declaration rather than do that. Come on, that's a sham. It upsets me. I want you to know that I've been practicing or serving in this court for over 50 years. And I know how that we get at the truth, and you're not helping me get to add to the truth. You're giving me press releases -- sham documents,\" he said.",
      "Everett Kelley, National President of the American Federation of Government Employees, praised the judge's decision.",
      "\"We are grateful for these employees and the critical work they do, and AFGE will keep fighting until all federal employees who were unjustly and illegally fired are given their jobs back,\" he said in a statement.",
      "While the judge originally suggested the avenue to contest the firings could be administrative, he noted that the Trump administration is attempting to \"decimate\" and \"cannibalize\" the Merit Systems Protection Board by firing its head and special counsel Hampton Dellinger.",
      "\"I got misled on something that there was no jurisdiction,\" Alsup said.",
      "The judge also ordered discovery, he said, \"to get it at the truth because the government is saying one thing, and you're saying another.\"",

      "White House officials took the unusual step of ordering a stop to the background check investigations after they deemed the process too intrusive, sources said.",
      "The procedure typically involves extensive interviews as well as a review of financial records, foreign contacts, past employment, and any potential security risks.",
      "The White House instead decided to transfer the background check process for White House personnel to the Department of Defense for them to complete the checks, the sources said.",

The FBI carries out investigations for presidential appointees that require Senate confirmation as well as some other presidential appointees, including White House staff.",

      "\"Background investigations for national security positions are conducted to gather information to determine whether you are reliable, trustworthy, of good conduct and character, and loyal to the U.S.,\" states the SF-86 form filled out by federal employees seeking security clearances and used for background investigations.",
      "However Trump and many of his allies entered the White House with a bitter distrust of the bureau over what they argued was its \"weaponization\" through the prosecutions brought against him by former special counsel Jack Smith. His top political appointees in the opening month of the administration quickly moved to purge senior ranks of the FBI and DOJ from anyone tied to the Smith prosecutions and those they believed wouldn't be politically loyal to Trump.",
      "Among Trump's first presidential actions was issuing a memorandum granting the highest level of security clearance to top White House officials who had not been fully vetted through the background check process.",
      "That list of officials, while not publicly disclosed, included dozens of high-level White House staffers, according to sources familiar with the matter.",
      "In that memorandum, Trump claimed there was a \"backlog\" in the security clearance process -- an issue he blamed on President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "However, Trump's transition team had refused for months to enter into an agreement with the Department of Justice under Biden to begin the background check process for individuals who would staff Trump's incoming administration, which has contributed in part to the staffing issues they now face."

      "The White House on Thursday pulled President Donald Trump's nomination of Dr. David Weldon to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, multiple sources told ABC News.",
      "The withdrawal came just before Weldon was to appear for his confirmation hearing before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, where he was expected to be grilled on his past comments questioning vaccine safety. The room was all set for the hearing before the developments, which was first reported by Axios.",
      "Weldon was pulled because he didn't have the votes to be confirmed, according to Weldon and two sources familiar with his nomination. This was the first time a CDC director nominee had to be Senate-confirmed, after Congress passed a law requiring it in 2022.",
      "\"Twelve hours before my scheduled confirmation hearing in The Senate, I received a phone call from an assistant at the White House informing me that my nomination to be Director of CDC was being withdrawn because there were not enough votes to get me confirmed,\" Weldon wrote in a lengthy four-page statement released Thursday afternoon.",
      "The key support Weldon lost, he said, was Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, chair of the Senate HELP Committee and a longtime physician who has expressed reservations that the incoming administration would sow distrust in vaccinations.",
      "Weldon said both Collins and Cassidy called him \"anti-vax\" and brought up his past comments suggesting vaccines are linked to autism, a claim debunked by numerous studies. While a Florida congressman, Weldon questioned the safety of the MMR vaccine and fought against using an ingredient called thimerosal in childhood vaccines.",
      "\"Clearly, big Pharma didn't want me in the CDC investigating any of this,\" Weldon wrote.",
      "Weldon said that Collins' staff had turned \"hostile\" on him during a recent meeting and that the senator told Kennedy at a meeting earlier this week that she was considering voting no.",
      "But multiple sources familiar with the meeting -- attended by staffers for multiple Republicans on the HELP committee -- refuted Weldon's assertion that Collins' staffers were \"hostile.\" Rather, the sources told ABC News, they pressed the nominee on how he planned to address accusations that he held anti-vaccine views.",
      "More concerning, one source said, was Weldon's apparent lack of preparation for the role of CDC director.",
      "According to the source, Weldon said multiple times in the meeting that he did not have a vision for the role and indicated he would develop one only after he was confirmed and could speak to department leaders.",
      "A person familiar with the matter also refuted Weldon's characterization that Cassidy made requests of the White House or told people how he was going to vote on the matter.",
      "\"Cassidy was not part of this decision,\" the person said.",
      "Weldon, a physician who served in Congress from 1995 until 2009, had kept a relatively low profile for years until being nominated by Trump in November.",
      "But his skepticism of established science around vaccines made him a popular pick among allies of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the new secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. Weldon say Kennedy had told him he was \"the perfect person for the job\" and was \"very upset\" that his nomination was withdrawn.",
      "Kennedy declined to comment on the withdrawal of Weldon\u2019s nomination when ABC News reached him by phone later Thursday.",
      "He also declined to share whom he would like President Trump to nominate next to be CDC director, referring inquiries to a top aide, Stefanie Spear, who did not respond to a message seeking comment.",
      "Meanwhile, Weldon told ABC News in a message that as of late Thursday afternoon he had not yet spoken to Kennedy since the news broke of his name being withdrawn.",
      "In 2007, Weldon co-authored a \"vaccine safety bill\" with former New York Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney, which sought to give control over vaccine safety to an independent agency within HHS.",
      "The bill, which stalled in a House subcommittee, would \"provide the independence necessary to ensure that vaccine safety research is robust, unbiased, free from conflict of interest criticism, and broadly accepted by the public at large,\" Weldon said in a press release announcing the bill.",
      "Weldon was being considered as CDC director amid a measles outbreak sweeping across the U.S.",
      "Democrat Sen. Patty Murray, former chair of the committee Weldon was going to testify before, said that he raised concerning anti-vaccine sentiment during their private meeting.",
      "\"In our meeting last month, I was deeply disturbed to hear Dr. Weldon repeat debunked claims about vaccines -- it's dangerous to put someone in charge at CDC who believes the lie that our rigorously tested childhood vaccine schedule is somehow exposing kids to toxic levels of mercury or causing autism,\" Murray said in a statement.",
      "\"As we face one of the worst measles outbreaks in years thanks to President Trump, a vaccine skeptic who spent years spreading lies about safe and proven vaccines should never have even been under consideration to lead the foremost agency charged with protecting public health,\" Murray added.",

      "The investigation is still active, police said.",
      "Justice Barrett was appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court in 2020 during President Donald Trump's first term. She is a devout Catholic, mother of seven children and was the youngest Supreme Court nominee since Clarence Thomas in 1991.",

      "In an email to DOJ division leaders on Wednesday, Assistant Attorney General Jolene Ann Lauria announced the formation of a \"JUST DOGE\" team, which will work with White House officials and \"DOGE counterparts\" to identify \"savings and cost-cutting measures\" within the department, according to a copy of the email reviewed by ABC News.",
      "The \"JUST DOGE\" team, formed earlier this week by the attorney general, is solely made up of senior DOJ officials, including \"co-leads\" AAG Lauria, Associate Deputy Attorney General James McHenry, Counselor to the Attorney General Sean Day and Counsel to the Deputy Attorney General Vetan Kapoor.",
      "According to the email, the new team will oversee the internal budget reviews and identify potential efficiencies at the Justice Department -- efforts that Musk's own DOGE personnel have spearheaded at other federal agencies.",
      "\"The JUST-DOGE team will lead directed reviews and identify cost savings and other potential efficiencies in DOJ's budget,\" the email read.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson told ABC News, \"President Trump and Elon Musk are doing historic work to identify and eliminate wasteful spending on behalf of American taxpayers, and JUST DOGE will advance this mission at the DOJ in order to ensure the Department's resources are best utilized to Make America Safe Again.\"",

Taylor II, who will be responsible for management and procurement; DAAG Christopher C. Alvarez, who will lead financial management and budgeting; and DAAG Meunda Rogers, who will head data and IT, according to the email.",
      "The formation of the team has stirred unease among some DOJ officials who worry that Musk's DOGE operatives could move aggressively to slash department personnel and programs, sources told ABC News. Meanwhile, others see the creation of the \"JUST DOGE\" team, which is composed entirely of current DOJ staff, as an attempt by department leadership to maintain control over the review process and create a buffer against Musk's team, which has been granted broad access and power at other agencies.",

Musk, who at times in the interview defended Bondi, also called the move by the attorney general \"disappointing.\"",

    "story": [
      "Trump officials say he can be removed under the Immigration and Nationality Act.",
      "The detaining of Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University student and Palestinian activist who possessed a green card, has raised questions about the deportation risks faced by lawful permanent residents amid the Trump administration's escalating crackdown on immigration.",
      "President Donald Trump's administration, which has alleged that Khalil was a supporter of Hamas, has said it has the authority to deport Khalil under the Immigration and Nationality Act.",
      "\"Secretary [Marco] Rubio reserves the right to revoke the visa of Mahmoud Khalil under the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Secretary of State has the right to revoke a green card or a visa for individuals who are adversarial to the foreign policy and national security interests of the United States of America,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a press conference this week.",
      "Khalil, whose detention has sparked protests this week, is married to an American citizen who is eight months pregnant. He has not been charged with a crime, and some supporters have accused the government of abducting him.",
      "Under the Immigration Nationality Act, which experts say is rarely invoked, the government can charge a green card holder as being deportable without being convicted of a crime if there are reasonable grounds to believe they engaged in certain criminal or terrorist activities.",
      "But experts and immigration attorneys ABC News spoke with said the statute does not give the secretary of state the power to deport green card holders like Khalil without going through a procedure.",
      "\"The way the statute is constructed, it doesn't mean that Secretary Rubio can just say, 'Oh, I determined this, and therefore we're just going to deport you out of the country,'\" said Greg Chen of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \"You would still need to go through a process.\"",
      "After the federal government invokes the statute, individuals like Khalil are entitled to argue their case before an immigration judge. Khalil is set to appear before an immigration judge later this month in Louisiana.",
      "\"There are some due process and protective procedures that the person is entitled to,\" Chen said, \"including being given a notice of the charges, and an opportunity to confront that evidence and to bring his or her own evidence in response.\"",
      "Chen told ABC News that typically it can take months or even years for immigration cases to \"go from start to finish\" -- but because of Khalil's \"unique circumstances,\" a judge can prioritize a case and expedite the process.",
      "Experts told ABC News there are a number of reasons why an individual could lose their green card, including marriage fraud, immigration fraud, violent crimes and other offenses.",
      "Andrew Nietor, an immigration attorney, told ABC News said that while there are cases where the government invokes the Immigration and Nationality Act for certain green card holders with criminal convictions, he said he has never seen a case like Khalil's.",
      "\"I've never seen this ground of deportation invoked,\" Nietor said. \"It's almost always a green card holder who is almost always in deportation proceedings because of some type of criminal conviction.\"",

      "The fate of the IRS Direct File program remains unclear as Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency cleave their way through the federal bureaucracy",
      "WASHINGTON -- Mia Francis, a 22-year-old barista from Boston, filed her taxes on her own this year for the first time, using a free government tax filing program that made it easy because it did most of the work for her.",
      "Francis said it took 45 minutes to finish her taxes with the IRS Direct File program, an electronic tax return filing system that the IRS made permanent last year and that has rolled out to 25 states.",
      "Francis is expecting a $530 refund. And because she saved cash by not using a commercial tax preparation company to file her taxes, \u201cthat money will go a long way,\u201d she said. She plans to use it for a trip to Amsterdam this year.",
      "Despite its popularity with Francis and other members of the American public, the IRS Direct File\u2019s fate remains unclear as Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency cleave their way through the federal bureaucracy. So far, the program is still available for use ahead of the April 15 tax filing deadline, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent committed during his January confirmation hearing to maintaining it, at least for this tax season.",
      "Representatives from the Internal Revenue Service and DOGE did not respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press on their plans for Direct File. But one Republican tax expert says the IRS never got congressional authorization to create Direct File. And Republican lawmakers and commercial tax preparation firms complain the program is a waste of money because free filing programs already exist, although they are hard to use.",
      "Direct File was rolled out as a pilot program in 2024 after the IRS was tasked with looking into how to create a \u201cdirect file\u201d system as part of the money it received from the Inflation Reduction Act signed into law by President Joe Biden in 2022. Last May, the agency announced that the program would be made permanent.",
      "The IRS accepted 140,803 returns filed by taxpayers using Direct File in the 12 states where it was available last tax season. It\u2019s been expanded to include half the country this year. It is unclear how many taxpayers have used Direct File this year.",
      "Merici Vinton, an original architect of Direct File from the U.S. Digital Service, noted the ease and accessibility of the program and called it \u201ca great example of how people should interact with the government in the 21st century.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe effectively launched a startup in the IRS,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was built by an in-house product team, in an iterative manner, and we ship updates to the software to improve user experience in real time based on feedback. If we continue to invest in it, both taxpayers and the IRS can benefit.\u201d",
      "Musk posted last month on his social media site that he had \u201cdeleted\u201d 18F, a government agency that worked on technology projects such as the IRS\u2019 Direct File program. This led to some confusion about whether Direct File is still available to taxpayers. However, conversations inside the IRS indicate that no decision has been made on whether to cut the program, two people familiar with these conversations tell the AP.",
      "Former IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel, who oversaw the rollout of the program, said Treasury officials considering the future of the program should take into account \u201cthe voice of the taxpayers.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy reflection is that taxpayers are in very different situations and have very different preferences for how they want to file,\" he said. \u201cThose whose preference is to file electronically direct with the IRS for free, it\u2019s a good option to have on the menu. But it should not replace other options.\u201d",
      "Derrick Plummer, a spokesperson for Intuit, one of the country's largest commercial tax preparation firms, said free tax preparation had been available for years before Direct File came along.",
      "\u201cIRS Direct File is a solution in search of a problem, a waste of taxpayer dollars and a drain on critical IRS resources,\u201d he said. A June 2024 Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration report estimates that the annual costs of Direct File may range from $64 million to $249 million.",
      "\u201cThe IRS should focus on its core mission including data privacy and customer service while policymakers in Washington focus on simplifying the tax code,\u201d Plummer said.",
      "However, other taxpayers, like 31 year-old Aquiel Warner in Austin, Texas, say they want to avoid using commercial tax preparation software.",
      "Warner filed her taxes with Direct File in 10 minutes using her phone and a chatbot that the IRS provides. She likes the program\u2019s convenience, that it prepopulated her tax forms and that it allowed for free filing. Although she has some concerns about data privacy in the government \u2014 DOGE is reported to have access to some of the IRS' internal systems \u2014 she feels more secure going through the IRS than commercial tax preparation services.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to be a product. I don\u2019t want my information sold when I file my taxes,\" she said. \"I have to file my taxes, and I don\u2019t want to be put in a situation where, in order to file my taxes, I have to pay to get the help I need because I\u2019m not a professional tax preparer.\"",
      "Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, said the IRS never got explicit permission from Congress to create the Direct File system.",
      "\u201cIt really doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a good idea. It was done illegally,\" he said, calling on Congress and the Justice Department to look into what he says is unauthorized spending that went into the creation of Direct File.",
      "Democratic lawmakers in January asked Bessent and IRS commissioner nominee Billy Long to preserve the program. They wrote in a letter that \u201cending Direct File would hurt everyday Americans.\u201d Long has not yet received a nomination hearing.",
      "In the meantime, Musk and his cadre of computer programmers could decide to wield their tech skills to boost the program \u2014 or use the very same digital savvy to delete it.",
      "For his part, Werfel hopes that the agency will keep the program. \u201cIt\u2019s a big country with a lot of taxpayers with a lot of different preferences,\u201d he said.",
      "Francis, the Boston barista, hopes so, too.",
      "\u201dThere are a lot of young people like me who are working and figuring out how to file their taxes \u2014 this just makes it faster and easier,\" she said."

      "A beloved reindeer in Alaska's biggest city is fighting for his life after falling mysteriously falling ill after someone tampered with his pen",
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- An iconic reindeer so beloved that he has been in parades, featured on reality TV shows and visited by schoolchildren on field trips in Alaska's largest city is fighting for his life after mysteriously falling ill after someone tampered with his pen.",
      "Ever since, 8-year-old Star has had pneumonia, digestion issues and rapid weight loss. Star's owner, Albert Whitehead, has taken him to a veterinarian every other day to receive care and in hopes of finding a cause for the issues.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019ve done everything possible for him,\u201d Whitehead said. Veterinarian Sabrieta Holland said she the reindeer's prognosis is \u201cguarded.\u201d",
      "Star lives in a fenced-in pen attached to Whitehead\u2019s house at the edge of downtown Anchorage. It\u2019s been over 20 years since someone last tried to tamper with the enclosure where reindeer named Star have been kept for the last seven decades. Star is the seventh in a line of reindeer to carry that name.",
      "In early January, someone cut a huge hole in the fencing to gain entrance, spending about five minutes inside with Star before taking off. What the person did in the pen is unknown, but Star began having stomach issues and dropping weight shortly after.",
      "Then, on Feb. 20, Anchorage police found the friendly and trusting reindeer wandering around downtown and returned him home.",
      "When Whitehead reviewed his security cameras, he found someone had used bolt cutters to remove padlocks off Star\u2019s pen and an alley gate. Star followed the man out into the neighborhood, and the reindeer wound up alone downtown, familiar streets because that's where Whitehead walks him.",
      "The next night, the situation turned more serious.",
      "Whitehead was watching the video feed when a man wearing a scarf over his face sprayed something from two different cans into Star\u2019s pen and twice hit the reindeer in the face with an unknown substance.",
      "Whitehead rushed outside to confront the man.",
      "\u201cI yelled at him to stop, \u2018What the hell are you doing? What are you spraying on the animal? Don\u2019t do that, quit that!\u2019\u201d Whitehead said.",
      "The man replied: \u201cI\u2019m trying to help Star.\"",
      "\u201cI have no idea what he meant by that,\u201d said Whitehead, who suspects \u2014 based on the smells \u2014 that the sprays could have been a disinfectant and deodorizer.",
      "Whitehead and police believe it was the same man from the prior night. It\u2019s not known if the January tampering involved the same person.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the individual wanted to harm Star, but by his actions, he did,\u201d Whitehead said.",
      "Anchorage police posted the surveillance video on social media in hopes it would lead to the suspect\u2019s identity. So far, no viable tips have come in, spokesperson Christopher Barraza said in an email.",
      "Star's pneumonia worsened, and a cough leads Whitehead to believe Star ate something harmful, perhaps while loose.",
      "The pneumonia is likely due to him accidentally inhaling the chronic reflux or regurgitation of the contents in the largest of the reindeers\u2019 four stomachs, Holland said. The sprays possibly also contributed.",
      "It\u2019s possible there\u2019s a blockage, but the largest stomach of a reindeer is quite big and not easily obstructed, Holland said. However, ingested plastic bags causing chronic weight loss and indigestion problems are the most common foreign objects she's seen in reindeer.",
      "The next option would be surgery to look at the reindeer's abdomen and possibly remove any blockage, but it\u2019s generally a poor outcome, even in healthy deer, she said.",
      "The bond between Whitehead and Star is \u201cquite significant and precious,\" Holland said.",
      "\"Albert\u2019s daily life and reason for getting out for walks and such all are because of Star. And Star is really fond of Albert, too,\u201d Holland said in a text. \u201cIt will be quite devastating for him if he loses Star.\u201d",
      "Anchorage pioneers Oro and Ivan Stewart started the reindeer tradition, bringing the deer they received from an Alaska Native herder to Anchorage in the 1950s. Whitehead took over as caretaker from his friends in 2002.",
      "The average lifespan of a reindeer is about 15 years, but some Stars had long lives, like the first who lived to 23. Others didn't live as long, including the second Star, who was stolen, beaten to death and then butchered by a known Fairbanks meat thief. The third Star died after eating a plastic bag."

      "SALT LAKE CITY -- Federal aviation investigators say a deadly 2023 Utah plane crash was likely caused by the North Dakota lawmaker piloting the aircraft who became disoriented as he took off at night without turning on the runway lights.",
      "North Dakota state Sen. Doug Larsen, his wife and their two young sons died when the small plane Larsen was piloting crashed near the desert recreation town of Moab, Utah, after a refueling stop. They were on their way home after visiting family in Scottsdale, Arizona, when the plane's landing gear struck a hill and brought the aircraft crashing down.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board said in a new report that Larsen lost his visual reference to the horizon and flew into rocky terrain.",
      "Security footage confirmed he did not turn on runway lights, which were fully operational at the time. A pilot can typically turn on runway lights easily with just a few clicks on the microphone at an uncontrolled airport like Canyonlands Airfield. Investigators did not find any mechanical problems with the single-engine Piper plane in their inspection of the wreckage.",
      "Before the flight, Larsen had received a weather briefing and logged nearly 45 hours of previous night flying experience, according to the report. It indicated that Larsen had received instrument training, a certification that allowed him to fly in low visibility conditions relying solely on aircraft instruments.",
      "The family took off from the Utah airfield at 8:23 p.m., before the moon had risen completely above the horizon in a region known for its dark skies and prime stargazing. A local operator in southeastern Utah told investigators that their company pilots do not usually depart at night from the runway Larsen used, due to the dark conditions and the lack of visual references.",
      "An autopsy of Larsen performed by the Office of the Medical Examiner and the Utah Department of Health and Human Services found that the cause of death was blunt force injuries.",
      "Larsen was a Republican first elected to the North Dakota Senate in 2020, where he chaired a panel on industry and business legislation. He and his wife, Amy, owned a home building company and hotels in Bismarck. Larsen served 29 years in the North Dakota Army National Guard and was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal, Bronze Service Star and Army Aviator Badge."

      "Sudan plunged into conflict in April 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary leaders broke out in the capital, Khartoum, and spread to other regions, including the vast western Darfur region.",

      "Russell said sexual violence used to terrorize the Sudanese population is pervasive, with an estimated 12.1 million women and girls \u2014 and increasingly men and boys \u2014 at risk right now. She said this is an 80% increase from last year.",
      "According to data UNICEF analyzed from groups providing services in Sudan, there were 221 reported cases of rape against children in 2024 in nine provinces, she said. UNICEF estimates that 67% of rape victims were girls and 33% boys.",

      "\u201cBoth sides have laid siege to towns, destroyed vital civilian infrastructure, and blocked humanitarian aid,\u201d he said.",
      "Lockyear said the Security Council has passed resolutions calling for an end to the conflict but has failed to translate its demands into action. What\u2019s needed today, he said, is a new compact that protects civilians, guarantees aid organizations full access to deliver food and assistance to the needy, and \u201censures the response remains independent from political interference.\u201d He said it must be \"underpinned by a robust accountability mechanism.\u201d",
      "He told reporters after the briefing that he heard some positive comments from members of the 15-nation Security Council, \u201cand I hope that translates into something practical.\u201d",

      "Tennessee became the first state in the country a hundred years ago to ban the teaching of evolution in public school classrooms",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- They called it the \u201cmonkey trial.\u201d It was supposed to be a publicity stunt.",
      "A hundred years later, it is remembered as far more.",
      "In March 1925, Tennessee became the first state in the country to ban the teaching of evolution in public school classrooms. Strong reactions rippled across the United States. The eventual upshot: a legal battle that became one of the most renowned in the nation's history.",
      "Historians say the trial started as a tourism gambit on behalf of the small town of Dayton, Tennessee \u2014 where the landmark case unfolded. The town's leaders were eager for an economic boost and encouraged a local teacher to challenge the law. They wanted the debate over the controversial anti-evolution mandate to take place in their own backyard while the rest of the country eagerly followed along.",
      "But amid the spectacle, the arguments and tensions raised during the eight-day trial persist. The rift over evolution and creationism \u2014 particularly in classrooms \u2014 has never fully been put to rest, and questions over how students should be taught about life's origins still spark debate among educators, lawmakers, and the public.",
      "Here's a look at what you need to know about the Scopes trial:",
      "No.",
      "In 1859, British naturalist Charles Darwin published \u201cOn the Origin of Species,\u201d which explained his theory of evolution by means of natural selection. Darwin's theory was seen as a direct challenge to the biblical story of creation by many fundamentalist Christians at the time. That contention came to a head in the 1920s when state lawmakers began considering outlawing the teaching of evolution in public schools.",
      "Tennessee lawmakers were the first to take the step, passing the Butler Act on March 13, 1925, banning the teaching of any theory saying humanity descended from a \u201clower order of animal\u201d in contradiction to the biblical teaching of divine creation.",
      "In response, the American Civil Liberties Union put out an ad offering to defend and finance the legal bills for any teacher willing to be a defendant in a test case challenging the evolution ban. According to the Tennessee State Library, Dayton community leaders found 24-year-old John T. Scopes, who had just finished his first year of teaching, willing to take up the test case.",
      "Scopes was arrested on May 9 and the trial started July 10.",
      "The Scopes trial became sensational largely because it brought together two long-time adversaries and powerful speakers William Jennings Bryan and Clarence Darrow.",
      "Bryan, a former secretary of state who ran for president three times and served in Congress, lent star power to the prosecution. Meanwhile, Darrow \u2014 one of the foremost defense attorneys of his time \u2014 agreed to represent Scopes after concluding a separate high-profile case where he saved child-killers Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb from the death penalty.",
      "Together, the two faced off in a contest not only between creationism and evolution, but also religion and science. Bryan, a fundamentalist Christian, was a leading champion of the anti-evolution movement in the early 1900s. Darrow was an agnostic.",
      "According to the ACLU, roughly 1,000 people and reporters from more than 100 newspapers attended each day of the trial.",
      "Many tried to capitalize off the case by playing off the popular misconception that Darwin's theory says man descended from apes. The actual theory says man and apes have a common ancestor, but local businesses nevertheless began selling primate-themed souvenirs and novelty dollars. The Dayton Hotel installed a gorilla display in its lobby and a trained chimpanzee named Joe Mendi was brought in to entertain spectators.",
      "Bryan himself took the stand to defend the biblical account of creation. Under withering questioning from Darrow, he conceded some biblical passages should be understood \u201cillustratively\u201d rather than literally.",
      "With as much ink and attention given to the Scopes trial, the case itself only lasted eight days and the jury returned a guilty verdict after deliberating for less than 10 minutes.",
      "Scopes was fined $100 for violating the Butler Act, a punishment that was eventually overturned on a technicality by the Tennessee Supreme Court.",
      "While the jury sided with the prosecution, the case generated more attention and interest in the theory of evolution. More than 20 anti-evolution theory bills were defeated in statehouses across the U.S. shortly after the Scopes trial. But the debate didn't end there.",
      "It would take another four decades before Tennessee lawmakers agreed to repeal the Butler Act, nearly around the same time the ACLU found another case to challenge anti-evolution laws.",
      "In the 1960s, the ACLU filed an amicus brief on behalf of a zoology teacher in Arkansas, challenging a state law that banned teaching \u201cthat mankind ascended or descended from a lower order of animals.\u201d Unlike the Tennessee case, the Arkansas legal battle went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court where justices declared the anti-evolution law a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.",
      "A federal judge ruled in 2005 that a Pennsylvania public school district could not teach \u201cintelligent design\u201d \u2014 the idea life is too complex to have arisen by natural causes \u2014 because it is \u201ca religious view, a mere re-labeling of creationism, and not a scientific theory.\u201d",
      "Today, the central themes surrounding the trial continue to pop up. Currently, conservative lawmakers across the country are pushing to introduce more Christianity in public school classrooms.",
      "Last year, West Virginia enacted a law permitting public school teachers to answer student questions \u201cabout scientific theories of how the universe and/or life came to exist\" that supporters said was needed to foster discussions beyond evolution.",
      "And in Texas, new state curriculum has sparked criticism due to its inclusion of biblical references, a lesson that asks students to repeat the phrase that starts the creation story in the Book of Genesis and an activity requesting that children remember the order in which the Bible says God created the universe."

      "A Utah judge has ordered the release of a 66-year-old suspect in the 1977 killing of a Hawaii teenager after prosecutors in Honolulu said they weren\u2019t ready to proceed with a murder charge against him",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- A Utah judge ordered the release of a 66-year-old suspect in the 1977 killing of a Hawaii teenager after prosecutors in Honolulu said they weren't ready to proceed with a murder charge against him.",
      "Gideon Castro was arrested in January at a Utah nursing home on a fugitive warrant for suspicion of second-degree murder in the death of 16-year-old Dawn Momohara. He had waived the right to challenge his extradition during a hearing in Salt Lake City last month. Castro, who is ill, appeared by video from a jail hospital bed.",
      "While he was still awaiting extradition, Honolulu prosecutors told their counterparts in Utah this week that they were not proceeding with the case against Castro because of \u201crecent complications involving a material witness in this case and the state of the evidence.\u201d",
      "\u201cPlease understand we view this as only a temporary setback, and we remain fully committed to continuing our efforts to prosecute this matter in the near future,\" Kelsi Guerra, a deputy prosecuting attorney in Honolulu wrote in a Monday letter to Deputy Salt Lake County District Attorney Clifford Ross.",
      "Utah District Court Judge John Nielsen ordered Castro's release Wednesday. Salt Lake County jail records no longer listed him as an inmate Thursday.",
      "On March 21, 1977, shortly after 7:30 a.m., Honolulu police found the body of Momohara on the second floor of a building at McKinley High School. She was lying on her back, partially clothed with an orange cloth wrapped tightly around her neck and had been sexually assaulted and strangled, police said.",
      "Castro was a student at the Honolulu school.",
      "An attorney for Castro had said during a hearing last month in Salt Lake City that he intended to fight the charges upon his return to Hawaii, where is still a resident, according to jail records. It is unclear how long Castro had been in Utah when he was arrested at the nursing home in Millcreek, just south of Salt Lake City.",
      "After Momohara\u2019s death, police released sketches of a person of interest and a possible vehicle described by witnesses as a 1974 or 1975 Pontiac LeMans. But they were unable to identify a suspect, and the case grew cold.",
      "Police used advances in DNA technology to connect Castro to the killing. They had interviewed Castro and his brother in 1977, but they were unable to conclusively link Castro to the killing until obtaining DNA samples in recent years."

      "DALLAS -- A former pastor of a Texas megachurch who resigned after a woman accused him of sexually abusing her in the 1980s has been indicted in Oklahoma on child sexual abuse charges, that state's attorney general\u2019s office said Wednesday.",
      "Robert Preston Morris, 63, has been charged with five counts of lewd or indecent acts with a child.",
      "The alleged abuse started in 1982 when the victim, referred to in the indictment as C.C., was 12 years old and Morris was a traveling evangelist staying in Hominy, Oklahoma, with her family, according to the attorney general\u2019s office. The abuse allegedly continued for four years.",
      "Cindy Clemishire, Morris\u2019 accuser, said in a statement that she is very grateful to the authorities who have worked to make the indictment possible and is hopeful \"justice will ultimately prevail.\u201d",
      "\u201cAfter almost 43 years, the law has finally caught up with Robert Morris for the horrific crimes he committed against me as a child,\" said Clemishire, now 55. \u201cNow, it is time for the legal system to hold him accountable.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press typically does not name people who say they have been sexually assaulted, but Clemishire said she would like her name included.",
      "Phone numbers associated with Morris were either disconnected or messages were not immediately returned Wednesday. It was unclear whether he has an attorney.",
      "\u201cThere can be no tolerance for those who sexually prey on children,\u201d Attorney General Gentner Drummond said in a statement. \u201cThis case is all the more despicable because the alleged perpetrator was a pastor who exploited his position. The victim in this case has waited far too many years for justice to be done.\u201d",
      "The Gateway Church, based in the Dallas suburb of Southlake, was founded by Morris in 2000. It said in a statement Wednesday that its members are praying for Clemishire and \u201call of those impacted by this terrible situation.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are aware of the actions being taken by the legal authorities in Oklahoma and are grateful for the work of the justice system in holding abusers accountable for their actions,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Morris resigned last year from the church after allegations came to light on the religious watchdog blog The Wartburg Watch.",
      "Clemishire told The Dallas Morning News last year that she met Morris in 1981, when he was a traveling preacher and began preaching at her family\u2019s church in Oklahoma. She said Morris and his wife and young son became close to her family. She said he was staying at her house in 1982 when the abuse began.",
      "The church has multiple locations in the area. It is among the largest in the United States, according to the attorney general\u2019s office.",
      "Morris was known to be politically active. The church hosted President Donald Trump on its Dallas campus in 2020 for a discussion on race relations and the economy.",
      "Morris could face up to 20 years in prison for each of the five charges, according to the attorney general\u2019s office. He was not in custody as of Wednesday."

      "U.S. wholesale inflation decelerated last month, suggesting that price pressures are easing for now",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. wholesale inflation decelerated last month, suggesting that price pressures are easing for now. But the progress may not last as President Trump intensifies his trade wars.",
      "The Labor Department reported Thursday that its producer price index \u2014 which tracks inflation before it reaches consumers \u2014 was unchanged from January after rising 0.6% the month before. Compared to a year earlier, producer prices were up 3.2%, down from a year-over-year gain of 3.7% in January.",
      "Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core wholesale prices fell 0.1% last month from January, first drop since July. Core producer prices rose 3.4%, lower than the 3.8% year-over-year gain in January. The numbers were all lower than economists had expected.",
      "The readout comes as Trump ramps up his trade war with a wide range of U.S. trade partners, threatening to send inflation higher. He has effectively imposed 25% taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on foreign steel and aluminum and has plastered 20% levies on Chinese imports. In coming weeks, he is set to impose 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and to introduce \"reciprocal tariffs'' that match higher taxes that other countries slap on U.S. products. And on Thursday the president threatened a 200% on European wine, champagne and spirits if Europe goes ahead with a tariff on U.S. whiskey.",
      "Major retailers have warned that they expect U.S. consumers to pull back spending this year in the face of higher costs, partially from from Trump's tariffs.",
      "On Wednesday, the Labor Department said that consumer price inflation slowed last month for the first time since September. The consumer price index was up 2.8% from a year ago, down from a 3% year-over-year increase in January. Core consumer prices rose 3.1% from a year earlier, smallest increase since April 2021.",
      "Wholesale gasoline prices fell 4.7% last month. Food prices rose 1.7% from January to February, led by a 28% surge in the price of eggs.",
      "After cutting its benchmark rate three times in late 2024, the Federal Reserve is expected to leave the rate unchanged at its meeting next week. \u201cThe Fed will not see any argument for pushing interest rates lower or sooner in today\u2019s figures,\u201d Carl Weinberg and Mary Chen of High Frequency Economics wrote in a commentary Thursday. \u201cThe Fed is focused now on the impact of tariffs on future food prices much more than it is focused on the impact of egg prices on prior (producer price) increases.\u2019\u2019",
      "Wholesale prices can offer an early look at where consumer inflation might be headed. Economists also watch it because some of its components, notably health care and financial services, flow into the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation gauge \u2014 the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, index. Thomas Ryan of Capital Economics noted that some of the wholesale prices that feed into the PCE measure, including hospital costs and international airfares, came in hotter than expected in February.",

Economists stress there could greater consequences on businesses and economies worldwide this time \u2014 and that higher prices will likely leave consumers footing the bill.",
      "There's also been a sense of whiplash from Trump's back-and-forth tariff threats and responding retaliation, including recently-postponed levies for some goods from Canada and Mexico that followed a 30-day pause for the auto industry. The uncertainty has roiled financial markets, lowered consumer confidence, and enveloped many businesses with questions that could delay hiring and investment.",
      "Here's a timeline of how we got here:",

      "Separately, Trump slaps tariffs on imported solar panels and washing machines. And in 2018, he escalates tensions with other trading partners by imposing taxes of 25% on imported steel and 10% on aluminum imports. He also uses the threat of more tariffs to force Canada and Mexico to renegotiate a North American trade pact, called the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, in 2020.",
      "President Joe Biden largely preserves most of the tariffs Trump previously enacted against China, but his administration claims to take a more targeted approach.",
      "In October 2022, he issues sweeping new restrictions on selling semiconductors and chipmaking equipment to China. These curbs will be expanded in October 2023 and December 2024 \u2014 when China responds with a ban of U.S. exports for various high-tech materials like gallium and germanium.",
      "Biden also hikes tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, solar cells, steel, aluminum and medical equipment in May 2024. And in July, he imposes tariffs on steel and aluminum shipped from Mexico but made elsewhere in an attempt to stop China from circumventing import taxes.",
      "Trump wins the U.S. presidential election. He continues to promise steep tariff hikes in the coming weeks and months leading up to his first day back in office.",
      "Trump is sworn in. In his inaugural address, he again promises to \u201ctariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens.\" And he reiterates plans to create an agency called the External Revenue Service, which has yet to be established.",

      "Trump signs an executive order to impose tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada and China \u2014 10% on all imports from China and 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada starting Feb. 4. Trump invoked this power by declaring a national emergency \u2014 ostensibly over undocumented immigration and drug trafficking. The levies on Canada and Mexico threaten to blow up Trump\u2019s own USMCA trade deal, which allowed many products to cross North American borders duty free.",
      "The action prompts swift outrage from all three countries, with promises of retaliatory measures.",

      "Trump announces plans to hike steel and aluminum tariffs. He removes the exemptions from his 2018 tariffs on steel, meaning that all steel imports will be taxed at a minimum of 25%, and also raises his 2018 aluminum tariffs to 25% from 10% set to go into effect March 12.",
      "Trump announces a plan for \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs \u2014 promising to increase U.S. tariffs to match the tax rates that other countries charge on imports \u201cfor purposes of fairness.\u201d Economists warn that the reciprocal tariffs, set to overturn decades of trade policy, could create chaos for global businesses.",
      "Beyond China, Canada and Mexico, he indicates that additional countries, such as India, won\u2019t be spared from higher tariffs. And in the following weeks, Trump suggests that European countries could face a 25% levy as part of these efforts.",
      "Trump signed an executive order instructing the Commerce Department to consider whether a tariff on imported copper is needed to protect national security. He cites the material's use in U.S. defense, infrastructure and emerging technologies.",

      "All three countries promise retaliatory measures. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announces tariffs on more than $100 billion of American goods over the course of 21 days. And Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum says her country would respond with its own retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods without specifying the targeted products immediately, signaling hopes to de-escalate.",

      "In a wider extension, Trump postpones 25% tariffs on many imports from Mexico and some imports from Canada for a month. But he still plans to impose \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs starting on April 2.",
      "Trump credited Sheinbaum with making progress on border security and drug smuggling as a reason for again pausing tariffs \u2014 and the Mexican president said in a post on X that she and Trump \u201chad an excellent and respectful call in which we agreed that our work and collaboration have yielded unprecedented results.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s actions also thawed relations with Canada somewhat, although outrage and uncertainty over the trade war remains. Still, after its initial retaliatory tariffs of $30 billion Canadian (US$21 billion) on U.S. goods, the government said it had suspended its second wave of retaliatory tariffs worth $125 billion Canadian (US$87 billion).",
      "China retaliates against Trump\u2019s tariffs by imposing additional 15% taxes on key American farm products, including chicken, pork, soybeans and beef. The escalating trade tensions push stocks lower on Monday as investors worry about the pain Trump\u2019s trade wars risk inflicting on the American economy.",
      "The Chinese tariffs were a response to Trump\u2019s decision to double the levy on Chinese imports to 20% on March 4. China\u2019s Commerce Ministry had earlier said that goods already in transit would be exempt from the retaliatory tariffs until April 12.",
      "Trump increases tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25%, removing exemptions from his 2018 tariffs on the metals in addition to increasing the tariffs on aluminum from 10%.",
      "The European Union takes retaliatory trade action with new duties on U.S. industrial and farm products. The measures will cover goods from the United States worth some 26 billion euros ($28 billion), and not just steel and aluminum products, but also textiles, home appliances and agricultural goods. Motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans will be hit, as they were during Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "Trump threatens a 200% tariff on European wine, Champagne and spirits if the European Union goes forward with a planned 50% tariff on American whiskey.",
      "The European import tax, which was unveiled in response to steel and aluminum tariffs by the U.S. administration, is expected to go into effect April 1, just ahead of separate reciprocal tariffs that Trump plans to place on the EU.."

The letter says funding will be withheld during the review.",

It also says executive officers must sign sworn statements that they have no knowledge or suspicions of anyone in their organizations violating the smuggling law.",
      "FEMA did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Wednesday.",
      "The demand appears to be a new salvo against organizations that provide food, housing and travel aid to people who cross the border. Migrants often arrive exhausted, low on money and unsure how to navigate on their own through bus stations and airports.",
      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican who was at odds with the Biden administration over immigration and is closely aligned with the Trump White House, took a similar tack against migrant aid groups but was blocked in court.",
      "FEMA\u2019s Shelter and Services Program awarded $641 million to dozens of state and local governments and organizations across the country in the 2024 fiscal year to help them deal with large numbers of migrants who crossed the border from Mexico. They include the cities of New York, Philadelphia, Chicago and Denver, as well as the United Way of Miami, the San Antonio Food Bank and several branches of Catholic Charities.",
      "It was unclear if any any governments received the letters, but the Trump administration has fiercely criticized states, counties and cities that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Last month, it sued Chicago over laws that it said thwarted federal law enforcement."

      "When severe weather hits the United States, there are ways people across the country can prepare for the potential impact of hail, rain, damaging wind and more.",
      "Tornadoes can take down power for thousands of people, cause catastrophic property damage and kill. The U.S. sees about 1,200 tornadoes each year.",
      "Experts say watching forecasts and knowing the meaning of different stages of warnings are key to safety.",
      "Here's what to know about the causes for these storms, and the alerts for watches, warnings and emergencies.",
      "The large areas of low atmospheric pressure that come with some storm systems can spawn tornadoes. Low pressure is associated with stormy weather, and the lower it is, the stronger a storm can be. Low pressure systems draw air into them, creating those rains and winds.",
      "\u201cIn the spring and the transition seasons \u2014 spring and fall and even winter \u2014 we get these really strong, what we call extratropical low pressure systems,\u201d said Victor Gensini, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Northern Illinois University. \"These are just storm systems that occur in the mid-latitudes of each of the hemispheres.",
      "\u201cIf you think about a map of the United States and you draw a big U across the map, that would be a big trough,\u201d he added. \u201cThat big trough helps promote the creation of this area of low pressure and strong storm system.\u201d",
      "These storm systems cause very strong winds and hail.",
      "Combine that with the \u201cwarm sector\u201d \u2014 or the side of the low-pressure storm system that has warm and humid air that wants to rise \u2014 and there's possibility of thunderstorms.",
      "In the right conditions \u2014 warm moist air close to the ground, cooler dry air above and wind changes \u2014 the storms could lead to tornadoes, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "The weather service's Storm Prediction Center issues a tornado watch in an area, up to 10 hours ahead of a storm, when conditions suggest possible tornadoes. People in that area, which usually covers several counties or states, should then be prepared for a potential warning.",
      "A warning is issued by local forecast offices when weather radar indicates a tornado is coming or has already been seen. This typically encompasses a smaller area such as a city or county. People in the area need to take action, such as moving to a shelter on the lowest floor of a building, and by avoiding windows.",
      "Tornado emergencies are the weather service's highest alert and are issued when a tornado has touched down in an area and catastrophic damage has been confirmed. They are rare, but require immediate shelter in place.",
      "People should have multiple ways to get watches and warnings and know the definitions of each, experts say. Weather radios can be especially helpful if power is lost and TVs and ordinary radios no longer work.",
      "It's also important to have safe, enclosed and underground shelters \u2014 or rooms above ground that are equipped to handle tornado-level winds \u2014 prepared in advance.",

      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- In a state so often bitterly divided along partisan lines, Democrats and Republicans alike were moved to tears as they gathered in Florida's capitol on Thursday to honor the life and legacy of Democratic state Sen. Geraldine Thompson, a longtime legislator, civil rights legend and educator who died on Feb. 13 at the age of 76, following complications from knee-replacement surgery.",
      "Thompson\u2019s husband and family members sat at her desk on the Senate floor, which was adorned with a bouquet of white roses and a black cloth, as her colleagues prayed, sang and shared their remembrances.",
      "A champion of voting rights and Black history, Thompson's tenure in the capitol began as a staffer for the first Black woman elected to the Florida Legislature, Gwen Cherry, before Thompson went on to her own terms of service in the House and Senate, where she represented central Florida for more than 15 years.",
      "She went toe-to-toe with Republican leaders to oppose what she saw as unconstitutional gerrymandering of voting districts and to defend the state's Black history, at a time when Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has worked to restrict how the darkest chapters of the state's story can be told in Florida classrooms.",
      "Speaking at Thursday's memorial service, Democratic state Sen. Darryl Rouson said Thompson \u201cepitomized Black history.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m reminded of the African proverb that says, \u2018when an elder dies, a library is burned to the ground.' We\u2019ve lost one of our premier and prestigious libraries with the passing of Senator Thompson,\" Rouson said.",
      "In a condolence letter written to Thompson's family and read by Democratic state Sen. Tracie Davis, former President Barack Obama called Thompson \u201ca model of the best kind of public service\u201d whose \u201ctrailblazing legacy\u201d will live on through the many lives she touched.",
      "Democratic state Sen. Rosalind Osgood first saw the late lawmaker in action in the capitol back in 2000, long before Osgood herself was elected to the legislature. For Osgood, Thompson was living proof that Black women belong in the state\u2019s halls of power.",
      "\u201cJust seeing these Black women legislate,\u201d Osgood said, \u201cit was mesmerizing.\u201d",
      "A beloved leader of the state's Legislative Black Caucus, Thompson is remembered as the conscience of the Florida Senate and a \u201cliving history lesson,\u201d someone who was deeply respected by her fellow lawmakers and the rare figure who could command her colleagues' full attention when she took to her feet to speak on the chamber floor.",

      "A volcano near Alaska\u2019s largest city is showing new signs of unrest, with experts saying the likelihood of an eruption at Mount Spurr in the next few weeks or months has increased",
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- A volcano near Alaska\u2019s largest city is showing new signs of unrest, with experts saying the likelihood of an eruption at Mount Spurr in the next few weeks or months has increased.",
      "The Alaska Volcano Observatory said Wednesday that it had measured during recent overflights \u201csignificantly elevated volcanic gas emissions,\u201d and said signs indicated an eruption was likely, though not certain, in the weeks or months ahead.",
      "\u201cWe expect to see further increases in seismic activity, gas emissions and surface heating prior to an eruption, if one were to occur,\u201d the observatory said in a statement. \u201cSuch stronger unrest may provide days to weeks of additional warning.\u201d",
      "It is an 11,070-foot (3,374-meter) tall, ice- and snow-covered volcano roughly 80 miles (129 kilometers) northwest of Anchorage.",
      "Mount Spurr is one of 53 volcanoes in Alaska that have been active within the last 250 years. It has two main vents.",
      "The last known eruption from the summit vent was more than 5,000 years ago. The Crater Peak vent, meanwhile, erupted once in 1953 and three times in 1992, according to the observatory. The Crater Peak vent is about 2 miles (3 kilometers) south of the summit.",
      "There have been periods of increased earthquake or other activity since then, including between 2004 and 2006, but no other eruptions. Last October, the observatory raised its alert status for Mount Spurr from green to yellow when an increase in seismic activity became pronounced and a ground deformation was spotted in satellite data.",
      "The most likely outcome of the current unrest would be an eruption or eruptions similar to those in 1953 and 1992, the observatory said.",
      "However, \u201cIt is also possible that no eruption occurs and the present activity slowly dies away or that a smaller eruption takes place,\u201d John Power, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey at the observatory, wrote in an email.",
      "The eruptions during the last century lasted between three and seven hours, produced ash columns that rose more than 50,000 feet (15,240 meters) above sea level and deposited ashfall in south-central Alaska communities, according to the observatory.",
      "In 1992, ashfall of about a quarter-inch in Anchorage prompted residents to stay inside or to wear masks if going outside to avoid breathing ash. The cloud drifted as far as Greenland.",
      "Volcanic ash is angular and sharp and has been used as an industrial abrasive. The powdered rock can cause a jet engine to shut down.",
      "The 1992 eruptions prompted the temporary closures of airports in Anchorage and other communities.",
      "Closing airports can be more than an inconvenience in a state where most communities aren't connected to Alaska's main road system. Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport also is among the world\u2019s busiest cargo hubs.",

      "High-security prisons across California have tightly restricted movement, calls and visits while officials probe a surge in violence this year.",
      "The restrictions started Saturday and affect the top-security sections of nearly a dozen lockups including the California Correctional Institution, California State Prison-Los Angeles County and California State Prison-Sacramento.",
      "Under the protocols, meals must be delivered directly to housing units and showers and any other movements must be done in a \u201ccontrolled manner,\u201d the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said in a statement.",

      "And hours later German M. Merino, 37, died after he was attacked by two inmates in Kern Valley State Prison, authorities said. He was serving a life sentence for first-degree murder.",
      "Prison violence is a longstanding problem as people serving life sentences have little to lose.",
      "In January, for example, Mario Campbell, 36, was attacked on the main exercise yard at the Sacramento prison by two inmates serving live with the possibility of parole, according to corrections officials. He died at a medical facility about an hour and a half later, and officers found three improvised weapons.",
      "The restrictions will stay in place until the investigation is completed. It\u2019s unclear how long that could take.",

    "story": [
      "Taxpayers and the pension schemes of Thames Water workers would both suffer if the UK's largest water company was temporarily nationalised, the water regulator and Thames' pension trustees have warned.",
      "Ofwat has not disputed that placing Thames under government control in the event the debt-laden company collapsed could end up costing taxpayers billions of pounds.",
      "Some 12,000 current and former employees could also see future pension entitlements reduced, according to documents seen by the BBC.",
      "The future of Thames Water is in the balance as the Court of Appeal considers whether a \u00a33bn emergency loan to the troubled utility giant can go ahead.",
      "Thames and the majority of its lenders have backed a plan that would see the company, which has a \u00a320bn debt pile, borrow a further \u00a33bn to keep it afloat long enough to complete a restructure.",
      "The supplier serves about a quarter of the UK's population, mostly across London and parts of southern England, and employs 8,000 people. It is expected to run out of cash completely by mid-April.",
      "The \u00a33bn rescue loan was approved following a crucial High Court battle last month, but a smaller group of lenders worried they stood to lose the most and Liberal Democrat MP Charlie Maynard, who argued that piling on more debt was not in the public interest, launched an appeal.",
      "The Court of Appeal has been hearing arguments over whether the loan should be granted, with a decision expected early next week.",
      "Thames Water secures \u00a33bn lifeline after court ruling",
      "Why is Thames Water in so much trouble?",
      "How much will I have to pay for my water?",
      "Documents seen by the BBC revealed Ofwat rejected claims from Maynard that Thames adding to its debt pile would mean higher bills and also that a collapse into administration would result in a negligible cost to taxpayers.",
      "In a letter to the court, the water regulator insisted that Thames would be barred from recovering any additional interest payments from customer bills.",
      "It said that it had seen \"no evidence to support\" a figure put forward by Maynard that administration would cost the government as little as \u00a366m.",
      "The regulator did not comment on Thames's estimate that it would cost taxpayers up to \u00a34bn.",
      "Environment Secretary Steve Reed has previously said government intervention in Thames Water would \"cost billions and take years\".",
      "Separately, the trustees for some 12,000 Thames Water pension scheme members have expressed concern that they \"could be significantly and detrimentally impacted\" should the company enter administration.",
      "If Thames were to collapse, those members would likely be transferred to the lifeboat Pension Protection Fund, which provides lower future benefits than those promised by the original scheme.",

      "Its third move, which is connected to both of the above, would be to attract new investors to pump money into a business that has attracted public anger and regulatory fines.",
      "While the government, the regulator and the pension trustees are keen to avoid a collapse, there are many who think that Thames Water needs to be put out of its misery - rather than lurching from one financial and operational crisis to another.",

    "story": [
      "Parents who are worried about their children being on Roblox should not let them use it, the chief executive of the gigantic gaming platform has said.",
      "The site, which is the most popular in the UK among young gamers aged eight to 12, has been dogged by claims of some children being exposed to explicit or harmful content through its games, alongside multiple reported allegations of bullying and grooming.",
      "But its co-founder and CEO Dave Baszucki insisted that the company is vigilant in protecting its users and pointed out that \"tens of millions\" of people have \"amazing experiences\" on the site.",
      "When asked what his message is to parents who don't want their children on the platform, Mr Baszucki said: \"My first message would be, if you're not comfortable, don't let your kids be on Roblox.\"",
      "\"That sounds a little counter-intuitive, but I would always trust parents to make their own decisions,\" he told BBC News in an exclusive interview.",
      "Responding to the interview, Mumsnet boss Justine Roberts said parents on the forum had spoken of how they struggled to manage their children's use of Roblox.",
      "\"There are parental controls, and our users would urge constant parental supervision,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"But we all know that with the best will in the world life sometimes gets in the way.",
      "\"If you've got multiple children you're looking after and things happen, and you probably can't 24/7 watch everything they're doing, even if you've got all your parental controls set.\"",
      "Ellie Gibson - from the Scummy Mummies podcast - said Mr Baszucki's message risked sounding \"a bit of a get out\".",
      "\"It's much easier said than done, especially when all their friends are playing it,\" she told the BBC.",
      "Gaming giant",
      "US-based Roblox is one of the world's largest games platforms, with more monthly users than Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation combined. In 2024 it averaged more than 80 million players per day \u2013 roughly 40% of them below the age of 13. Its vast empire includes some 40 million user-generated games and experiences.",
      "In the UK the Online Safety Act, which comes in to force in April, has strict laws for all tech firms specifically aimed at protecting children from online harms.",
      "But Mr Baszucki says he remains confident in Roblox's safety tools and insists the firm goes above and beyond to keep its users safe.",
      "\"We do in the company take the attitude that any bad, even one bad incident, is one too many,\" he says.",
      "\"We watch for bullying, we watch for harassment, we filter all of those kinds of things, and I would say behind the scenes, the analysis goes on all the way to, if necessary, reaching out to law enforcement.\"",
      "Players who choose not to display what he calls \"civility\" can face temporary time-outs and longer bans, and Roblox claims to analyse all communications that pass between members on the platform, increasingly using more advanced AI systems and other tech to do so \u2014 and anything flagged is sent for further investigation.",
      "In November last year, under 13s were banned from sending direct messages, and also from playing in \"hangout experiences\" which features chat between players.",
      "Safety filters bypassed",
      "However, the BBC was able to create two fake accounts, one aged 15 and one aged 27, on unlinked devices and exchange messages between the two.",
      "While the filters caught our attempts to overtly move the conversation onto a different platform, we found easy ways to re-word requests to chat elsewhere and make suggestions about playing more adult games.",
      "When we showed the Roblox boss these findings, he argued that our example highlighted the comparative safety of Roblox: that people felt they had to take content which might breach Roblox's rules to other platforms.",
      "\"We don't condone any type of image-sharing on our own platform, and you'll see us getting more and more, I think, way beyond where the law is on this type of behaviour,\" Mr Baszucki says.",
      "He admits there is a delicate balance between encouraging friendships between young people, and blocking opportunities for them come to harm, but says he is confident Roblox can manage both.",
      "We also put to him some Roblox game titles that the BBC has discovered were recommended by the platform to an 11 year-old recently, including:",
      "'Late Night Boys And Girls Club RP''Special Forces Simulator'''Squid Game''Shoot down planes\u2026because why not?'",
      "'Late Night Boys And Girls Club RP'",
      "'Special Forces Simulator''",
      "'Squid Game'",
      "'Shoot down planes\u2026because why not?'",
      "When we asked whether he thought they were appropriate, he said he puts his faith in the platform's age rating systems.",
      "\"One thing that's really important for the way we do things here, is it's not just on the title of the experience, it's literally on the content of the experience as well,\" he says.",

      "Plan to make phone use safer for teens watered down",
      "Mr Baszucki founded the platform with Eric Cassel in 2004 and released it to the public in 2006 \u2013 a year before the first Apple iPhone appeared, heralding the start of the smartphone era.",
      "Mr Baszucki describes his younger self as \"less of a gamer, and more of an engineer\", and the pair's first company was an education software provider called Knowledge Revolution. But they soon noticed that kids weren't only using the product to do their homework.",
      "\"They wanted to play and build stuff. They were making houses or ships or scenery, and they wanted to jump in, and all of that learning was the germination of Roblox,\" he says.",
      "The name Roblox was a mash-up of the words \"robot\" and blocks\" \u2013 and it stuck. The platform grew quickly in popularity \u2013 and there were also early warning signs of its future issues.",
      "Mr Cassel noticed some players \"starting to act out\" and not always behaving in a \"civilised\" way a couple of months after it launched, recalls Mr Baszucki.",
      "He says the roots of building a \"trust and safety system\" therefore began \"very, very early\" and that in those earlier days there were four people acting as safety moderators.",
      "\"It kind of is what launched this safety civility foundation,\" he adds.",
      "But despite attracting decent numbers, it was a year later, when the firm launched its digital currency Robux, that it really started to make money.",
      "Players buy Robux and use it to purchase accessories and unlock content. Content creators now get 70% of the fee, and the store operates on dynamic pricing, meaning popular items cost more.",
      "Mr Baszucki says there was some initial resistance among the leadership team about Roblox becoming more than a hobby for its players, with the introduction of a digital economy.",
      "Robux stayed, and the firm is now worth $41bn (\u00a331bn).",
      "Its share price has fluctuated since it went public in 2021, but overall Roblox shares are worth about one third more than they were six months ago, at the time of writing. Like many big tech firms its value peaked during Covid, when lockdowns meant millions of people were indoors.",
      "Mr Baszucki compares his experience of building Roblox with how Walt Disney may have felt about his creations.",
      "He describes his job as \"a little like having the opportunity he had a long time ago when he was designing the Magic Kingdom\", and is focused on Roblox's ongoing evolution into a Metaverse-style experience where people go about their daily lives in a virtual world, in avatar form.",
      "They have also been public in their ambitions to eventually attract 10% of the world's gamers.",
      "Asked to describe Roblox in three words, he replies: \"The future of communication.\"",

      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said the UK will \"keep all options on the table\", but has not announced immediate retaliation.",
      "BBC Verify looks at how big the impact on the UK could be and what might happen next.",
      "Starmer says 'all options on table' on US tariffs",
      "Metal products",
      "The value of the UK's raw steel and aluminium exports to the US in 2024 was around \u00a3470m.",
      "But it's important to note that these latest US tariffs - taxes on imports - also cover products made with steel and aluminium, which covers everything from gym equipment, to furniture, to machinery.",
      "It's estimated by the Global Trade Alert think tank that the UK's exports of these products to the US in 2024 was around \u00a32.2bn.",
      "So the total annual value of UK exports affected would be around \u00a32.7bn.",
      "For context, the UK exported around \u00a358bn of goods to the US on an annual basis in 2024 - so the share of goods hit by these new Trump tariffs represents just under 5%.",
      "The UK hopes to conclude a free trade deal with the Trump administration, which could mean these tariffs being removed.",
      "But we have no way of knowing if - or how soon - such an agreement could be concluded.",
      "Trump has also threatened to impose reciprocal tariffs on all the United States' trading partners, including the UK, from next month.",
      "These are taxes on imports to the US which are set at a similar rate to taxes other countries put on goods they import from the US.",
      "And the White House has said that, in deciding what level to set them, it will take into account countries' Value Added Tax rates.",
      "The US government regards VAT as a tax that discriminates against US imports - even though it applies equally to imports and domestically-produced goods.",
      "The UK has a 20% standard VAT rate, which could potentially mean the UK being hit by a substantial reciprocal tariff from the US.",
      "While the UK is not yet retaliating, the European Union has already confirmed it plans to impose tariffs on 26bn euros (\u00a322bn) a year worth of goods imported from America.",
      "And the EU is targeting US goods including Bourbon whiskey, jeans and Harley-Davidson motorcycles, which are considered to be politically sensitive in America because of their iconic status and because of which US states some of them are  produced in.",
      "Notwithstanding the hope for a free trade deal, in the wake of any reciprocal tariffs imposed by the US, which are perceived to be unfair and punitive, the UK government could find itself under growing pressure to retaliate in a similar way to the EU.",
      "Why is Trump imposing tariffs?",
      "The US President has a long - and often shifting - list of justifications for imposing these import taxes.",
      "One is that he claims to want to restore fairness to America's trading relations with the rest of the world.",
      "Trump complains that some other countries have higher tariffs on the goods they import from the US, than the other way round.",
      "The US had an average external tariff of 3.3% in 2023.",
      "That was slightly lower than the UK's average tariff of 3.8%.",
      "It was also below the European Union's average tariff of 5% and China's average tariff of 7.5%.",
      "However, America's average tariff was considerably lower than those of some of its other trading partners such as India (17%) and South Korea (13.4%).",
      "Broadly speaking, it is legitimate for Trump to point out that some countries have a higher average tariff on imports than America does.",
      "Replacing income tax?",
      "Another justification for tariffs from the president is raising more tax revenue for the US government. At one stage during the presidential election campaign in 2024, he suggested that tariff revenue could entirely replace the federal income tax.",
      "This is not only implausible given the $3 trillion a year value of US imports and the $2 trillion a year raised by income tax - but it needs to be seen in the context of the fact that tariffs would push up US consumer prices.",
      "Trump also wants to put pressure on other countries to change some of their policies. This has been the explicit rationale for US tariffs on Canada and Mexico, with the White House saying it wants to pressure those countries to stamp out cross-border Fentanyl smuggling.",
      "Another key goal articulated by the president is wanting to encourage multinational manufacturing companies to invest and produce more in America to create domestic jobs.",
      "Some of these justifications are inconsistent.",
      "Tariffs cannot be a both a major permanent tax revenue raiser as well as a way to bring manufacturing back to America on a large scale as the latter implies imports - and therefore tariff revenues - slumping.",
      "Moreover, the vast majority of economists are also extremely sceptical about the likelihood of tariffs achieving many of these goals.",

      "Sir Keir was challenged at PMQs by Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey and Labour's Richard Burgon, who said disabled people were \"frightened\" and suggested \"the moral thing to do\" would be to introduce a wealth tax.",
      "Starmer says benefit system unfair and indefensible",
      "Work coaches to focus on long-term unemployed",

      "Speaking at PMQs, Sir Ed asked the prime minister to confirm that disability benefits for people who cannot work would not be cut.",
      "Sir Keir said: \"We will of course support those who need support, but help those who can work into work. They'll be the guiding principles.\"",
      "Later, Labour MP Burgon said that when disabled people \"hear the language of tough choices... it means the easy option of of making the poor and vulnerable people pay\", and said the \"courageous\" thing to do would be to introduce a wealth tax.",
      "Sir Keir responded that the Conservatives had \"locked millions out of work\" and there was \"a moral imperative\" to \"help those who want to work to get back into work\".",
      "On a wealth tax, he added: \"We have raised money, the energy profits levy, taxing non-doms, and air passenger duty on private jets, but this isn't a bottomless pit and must kickstart growth to get the economic stability that we need.\"",
      "Labour MPs have been called in to 10 Downing Street to discuss the changes,",
      "Bassetlaw MP Jo White, who represents the so-called Red Wall MPs, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was \"a moral duty to change people's lives\".",
      "\"It's a generational thing \u2013 if families are out of work they tend to bring up their children to exist on the benefits system,\" she said.",
      "\"People slide along on that low level of income, perhaps dipping into the black market, but their aspirations are so low and the communities do not change.\"",
      "Tackling this issue through changing the welfare system \"is absolutely critical\", White argued, because in order to \" lift people out of poverty... they need to be in work\".",
      "But significant numbers of Labour colleagues are unhappy. Nottingham East MP Nadia Whittome told the BBC her party was \"getting it badly wrong on this\".",
      "\"We cannot go back\" to the \"narrative of strivers versus skivers\", she said.",
      "Asked if she would rebel over the issue, Whittome said: \"I was on these benefits - my mum had to stop work when I was a teenager to care for me.",
      "\"I represent disabled people, all of us do, and we all hear their stories every day and just how scared they are about this and what a difference these payments make to their lives.",
      "\"I can't look my constituents in the eye, I can't look my mum in the eye, and support this.\"",
      "Many Labour MPs who spoke to the BBC have said they agreed many people currently on disability benefits could work and should.",
      "But they worried the government's rumoured plans, such as freezing Personal Independence Payments, would punish all those on disability benefits, including those with severe disabilities who could never work.",
      "That would be \"unforgivable\", one MP told the BBC.",
      "Another said making it more difficult to access disability payments was \"not what the Labour party ought to be about\".",
      "\"It's our very DNA that Labour was created to lift people out of difficult circumstances,\" they said.",
      "\"The government needs to stop talking about everyone who is on disability benefits as if they are all the same because they are not,\" said another.",
      "In the UK 1.3m people now claim disability benefits primarily for mental health or behavioural conditions \u2013 44% of all claimants, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) found.",
      "Exploring the reasons behind the rise, which has \"accelerated\" since the pandemic,  researchers said the UK was an outlier compared to other countries, none of which have seen the same level of post-pandemic increases in health-related benefit claims.",
      "More than half of the rise in 16 to 64-year-olds claiming disability benefits since the pandemic is for claims relating to mental health or behavioural conditions, according to a report from the IFS.",
      "Researchers found particularly fast growth in new disability benefit claims for learning disability and autism spectrum claims.",
      "There was also evidence of increasing levels of severe mental health problems.",
      "There is a heightened rate of mortality among working age people, due to \"deaths of despair\"- either by suicide, alcohol or drug misuse - and such deaths are much more likely if someone has a mental health illness.",
      "Trades Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Paul Nowak said slashing welfare for disabled people would \"only make the current challenges worse\".",
      "He urged Labour not to cut PIP, which he said enables many disabled people to access work rather than relying on benefits, but he backed reforms to a \"one-size-fits all approach\" towards one that provides tailored employment support.",
      "\"Trade unions share the government's ambitions to improve the nation's health and to help more people into good quality work,\" he said.",

      "Trump's initial tariffs on European steel in 2018 saw EU steel exports to the US fall by more than a million tonnes, and for every three tonnes of steel that did not enter the US, two-thirds of it entered the EU instead.",
      "\"These new measures imposed by Trump are more extensive, therefore the impact of the US tariffs is likely to be far greater.\""

      "Now two months into his presidency, he's painting a slightly different picture.",
      "He has warned that it will be hard to bring down prices and the public should be prepared for a \"little disturbance\" before he can bring back wealth to the US.",
      "Meanwhile, even as the latest figures indicate inflation is easing, analysts say the odds of a downturn are increasing, pointing to his policies.",
      "So is Trump about to trigger a recession in the world's largest economy?",
      "Markets fall and recession risks rise",
      "In the US, a recession is defined as a prolonged and widespread decline in economic activity typically characterised by a jump in unemployment and fall in incomes.",
      "A chorus of economic analysts have warned in recent days that the risks of such a scenario are rising.",
      "A JP Morgan report put the chance of recession at 40%, up from 30% at the start of the year, warning that US policy was \"tilting away from growth\", while Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, upped the odds from 15% to 35%, citing tariffs.",
      "The forecasts came as the S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest companies in the US sank sharply. It has now fallen to its lowest level since September in a sign of fears about the future.",
      "The market turmoil is being driven partly by concerns about new taxes on imports, called tariffs, which Trump has introduced since he took office.",
      "He has hit products from America's three biggest trade partners with the new duties, and threatened them more widely in moves that analysts believe will increase prices and curb growth.",
      "The latest official inflation figures in the US showed the rate of price increases cooling in February, however.",
      "Prices were up 2.8% over the 12 months to February, down from 3% in January, the Labor Department said.",
      "Still, Trump and his economic advisers have been warning the public to be prepared for some economic pain, while appearing to dismiss the market concerns - a marked change from his first term, when he frequently cited the stock market as a measure of his own success.",
      "\"There will always be changes and adjustments,\" he said last week, in response to pleas from businesses for more certainty.",
      "The posture has increased investor worries about his plans.",
      "Goldman Sachs last week raised its recession bets from 15% to 20%, saying it saw policy changes as \"the key risk\" to the economy. But it noted that the White House still had \"the option to pull back if the downside risks begin to look more serious\".",
      "\"If the White House remained committed to its policies even in the face of much worse data, recession risk would rise further,\" the firm's analysts warned.",
      "Tariffs, uncertainty and slowing growth",
      "For many firms, the biggest question mark is tariffs, which raise costs for US businesses by putting taxes on imports. As Trump unveils tariff plans, many companies are now facing lower profit margins, while holding off on investments and hiring as they try to figure out what the future will look like.",
      "Investors are also worried about big cuts to the government workforce and government spending.",
      "Brian Gardner, chief of Washington policy strategy at the investment bank Stifel, said businesses and investors had thought Trump intended tariffs as a negotiating tool.",
      "\"But what the president and his cabinet are signalling is actually a bigger deal. It's a restructuring of the American economy,\" he said. \"And that's what's been driving markets in the last couple of weeks.\"",
      "The US economy was already undergoing a slowdown, engineered in part by the central bank, which has kept interest rates higher to try to cool activity and stabilise prices.",

      "Retail sales fell in February, confidence - which had popped after Trump's election on several surveys of consumers and businesses - has fallen, and companies including major airlines, retailers such as Walmart and Target, and manufacturers are warning of a pullback.",
      "Some analysts are worried a drop in the stock market could trigger a further clampdown in spending, especially among higher income households.",
      "That could deliver a major hit to the US economy, which is driven by consumer spending and has grown increasingly dependent on those richer households, as lower income families face pressure from inflation.",
      "The head of the US central bank, Jerome Powell, offered assurances in a speech last week, noting that sentiment had not been a good indicator of behaviour in recent years.",
      "\"Despite elevated levels of uncertainty, the US economy continues to be in a good place,\" he said.",
      "But the US economy is currently deeply linked to the rest of the world, warned Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB.",
      "\"The fact that tariffs could disrupt that at the same time that there were signs that the US economy was weakening anyway ... is really fuelling recession fears,\" she says.",
      "Stock market in tech ripe for correction",
      "The unease in the stock market isn't all about Trump.",
      "Investors were already jittery about the possibility of a correction, after big gains over the last two years, driven by the sharp run-up in tech stocks fuelled by investor optimism about artificial intelligence (AI).",
      "Chipmaker Nvidia, for example, saw its share price jump from less than $15 at the start of 2023 to nearly $150 in November of last year.",
      "That type of rise had stirred debate about an \"AI bubble\" - with investors on high alert for signs of it bursting, which would have a big impact on the stock market, regardless of the dynamics in the wider economy.",
      "Now, with views of the US economy darkening, optimism about AI is getting even harder to sustain.",
      "Tech analyst Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management wrote on social media this week that his optimism had \"taken a step back\" as the chance of a recession increased \"measurably\" over the past month.",
      "\"The bottom line is that if we enter a recession, it will be extremely difficult for the AI trade to continue,\" he said.",

      "Trump said he had told Musk, \"You know, Elon, I don't like what's happening to you, and Tesla's a great company.\"",
      "Musk, Trump's top donor in the election campaign, has been tasked with radically cutting government spending through his Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).",

      "So something different might have been better, says Jane Kent, a community nurse.",
      "\"People will be larding out on all the bakery stuff,\" she says. \"We don't need more pastries.\"",
      "At heart, though, the objections to Gail's are not about what it sells, but that it doesn't really belong, that it will push up prices and put independent cafes out of business.",
      "But Stephanie Lamb, a teacher on maternity leave, is more welcoming.",
      "\"I don't know Gail's, so it's not necessarily a chain to me,\" she says. \"I'm just happy to have something extra in town.\"",
      "She likes a latte and a croissant and somewhere she can read a book for an hour.",
      "At Gail's prices that would set her back \u00a36.50. Yes, it's pricey, she says, but she is still planning to \"give it a whirl\".",
      "Gail's - a name that suggests a traditional, single-owner, cafe - favours attractive old buildings, often ones vacated as bank branches close, especially if it is a corner site that means it's more visible to passers by.",
      "It has 170 outlets mostly clustered in London and the south east. But this year it plans to open around 40 more, including Ely, Cambridgeshire later this month, Bath in April, and Buxton, Derbyshire in May.",
      "At Friday's opening in Macclesfield there was a flurry of interest in the new place on the square.",
      "Even in the wake of the cost of living crisis, we are increasingly choosing a coffee out as a treat. Nearly two-thirds of people said they went to a coffee shop more than once a week, according to World Coffee Portal, spending more than \u00a36 per visit on average.",
      "So coffee shops are weathering the tough economic climate better than most businesses. There are now 11,450 branded chain outlets across the UK, up from 9,800 five years ago.",
      "Speciality chains like Black Sheep Coffee, Coffee#1 and Blank Street are springing up in city centres, while the giants like Costa and Starbucks are opening drive-throughs and outlets in retail parks.",
      "Caffe Nero has bought up several smaller chains, in different parts of the country, and is retaining their independent branding so it can make the most of local loyalties.",
      "With enthusiasm for coffee so strong it's something of a mystery to Gail's chief executive Tom Molnar why people object to his chain. He feels misunderstood.",
      "Mr Molnar - a joint owner with private equity backing - has been working on expanding the brand since he joined in 2003, but says it's not just about coffee. Its role as a neighbourhood bakery - baking fresh in-store and in regional bakery hubs every day - is key.",
      "He's hoping to roll Gail's out to many more neighbourhoods, including less affluent ones.",
      "\"It's not supposed to be posh,\" he insists.",
      "But for now they pick very carefully where to open, using an algorithm to help select the most promising postcodes.",
      "It flags up things like whether there is a local butcher, bookshops, a park, schools, churches or a farmers' market.",
      "\"I prefer a place that's evolving and growing rather than some place that's too established,\" he says.",
      "If the algorithm homes in on a particular High Street it is a vote of confidence in that town's future.",
      "But retail experts warn that the very nature of the places that Gail's is picking means there are likely to be accusations of gentrification, increasing prices and rents for existing businesses and residents.",
      "\"Gail's is moving into areas with strong local identities. And when that happens, there will always be a reaction,\" says Kate Hardcastle, founder of Insight with Passion.",
      "\"It's not just about a bakery opening, I think it's also about what it represents.",
      "\"Some will see it as a sign of investment and revitalisation, while others worry it's another step back to our High Streets looking like carbon copies of each other,\" she says.",
      "In Flour, Water, Salt - a direct rival to Gail's selling sourdough bread, bagels, coffee-iced buns and sausage rolls - that is just yards from the new shop, some loyal customers are adamantly opposed to the newcomer.",
      "\"Gail's isn't welcome here,\" says Karen Pearson, a businesswoman who lives just outside Macclesfield. She and her friends are worried that the arrival of Gail's means the town is \"on the up\", when in fact they would rather it \"stayed like it is\".",
      "They're not keen on big corporations coming into the town, concerned they might squeeze out independents.",
      "But firefighter and local councillor Anthony Harrison, reckons Gail's is no match for a place like Flour, Water, Salt. \"It's just a posh Greggs,\" he says.",
      "Independents may not be as under threat as people fear, says Graham Soult, a retail consultant from the north of England.",
      "Local owners can offer a more personal touch, respond to local tastes and demands,  he says, while it can be hard for chains to deviate from their given formula.",
      "\"I think a lot of independents are really adept at navigating all the things that are thrown at them,\" he says.",
      "Despite difficult times, the number of independent coffee shops has risen over the last five years from 11,700 to around 12,400 now.",
      "Flour, Water, Salt's manager Toby Johnstone isn't worried. It could mean more footfall, with more people trying his shop too.",
      "\"We are happy there's something else opening and keeping the town centre going,\" he says. \"It's good to have competition.\""

      "Then once inside Chase's new La Guardia lounge you can then choose to pay up to $3,000 to access a private suite for a few hours.",
      "BBC Business Daily: the battle of the VIP lounges",
      "It is all part of what has been described as a global arms race among the credit card companies that you are probably entirely unaware of \u2013 they are competing to outdo each other with bigger, better, bolder airport lounges.",
      "And while most of us don't have access to these lounges, experts say we are almost certainly helping pay for them. And they don't come cheap.",
      "\"Yes, it's an arms race, and they're getting extraordinary,\" says Clint Thompson, the news editor at the flight and travel website The Points Guy. \"From what we do know, we're talking up to tens of millions of dollars per lounge.",
      "\"Like the new [American Express-owned] Centurion lounge in Atlanta, I believe they spent about $100m to make that happen.\"",
      "Airport lounges aren't a new concept, and credit card issuers have long teamed up with airlines to offer branded credit cards with lounge access.",
      "But now the card issuers are building lounges themselves, as a way of directly appealing to card holders - and potential new customers too.",
      "JP Morgan Chase, American Express, Capital One, they're all now in the lounge - and lifestyle - business.",
      "For American Express this includes opening a high-end lounge in midtown Manhattan.",
      "Its Centurion New York venue is located on the 55th floor of a skyscraper, with floor to ceiling windows offering sweeping views of New York, and fine dining and private bars.",
      "It's designed for Centurion card holders \u2013 a card which will cost you $10,000 as a signing on fee, plus $5,000 a year. And it is invite-only to get one.",
      "\"We're more than a credit card company or a charge card company, it's more a lifestyle brand, getting you special access to concerts, getting you into restaurants,\" says Audrey Hendley, the head of global travel at American Express.",
      "The card issuers have even moved into a 21st Century staple, the coffee shop.",
      "Capital One have Capital One Caf\u00e9s - now you have a barista in a bank.",
      "Their branch in the Georgetown neighbourhood of Washington DC has all the classic signs of the hip coffee shop - exposed vents, bare brick walls, barista coffee machine.",
      "The only immediate giveaway you might be in the bank is the neon Capital One sign on the wall and their branded touch screens. Look a bit closer, and you might spot one of their casually dressed people who looks like a customer, but is actually what Capital One calls their ambassadors, here to welcome you in and help you with all your banking needs.",
      "Anyone can use the caf\u00e9, but hold a Capital One card and you get money off your brew.",
      "\"We're creating a showroom for our products,\" says Shaun Rowley the director of Capital One Cafes.",
      "\"For customers to come in and see Capital One in action, to touch it, to smell it and even taste it with our cafes. And watching them walk out, as you know, raving fans and advocates for us is kind of the return that we're looking for.\"",
      "None of this sounds like the sort of language you hear normally hear from financial institutions.",
      "Dan Bennett is the head of behavioural science the ad giant Ogilvy. He says this is all about brands tapping into how people think about themselves, and other people.",
      "\"Yeah, it is a piece of plastic with the chip in it that holds your money, but it is something that actually gives you a position in society,\" he says. \"It is something that says something about who you are. It is something that can make you feel elevated.",
      "\"The credit card firms are not just building rooms at airports, they're building a sense of self. It's kind of amazing that financial services companies have managed to kind of look at some deep-core human drivers, and then build experiences around that.",
      "\"And that's why they're so successful with them, because they've managed to find the psychological levers to pull, rather than just looking at the world through a rational lens.\"",
      "But even if you're never going to get access to these places, you are ultimately still paying for them, according to Lulu Wang. He's assistant professor of finance at Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University near Chicago, and has studied how card payment systems work.",
      "He points out that credit cards are more expensive for merchants, be they retailers, or bars and restaurants to accept than debit cards as they incur a higher processing fee.",
      "Prof Wang says merchants are likely to put up prices to cover the additional cost of people using credit cards.",
      "\"We typically think that corporations, you know, they're facing higher costs, they're going to pass on a pretty substantial share of those costs onto consumers,\" he explains.",
      "\"If we impose all these costs on the merchant, it ends up being a cost that is ultimately borne by all of us as consumers. Well-off people get to use the high merchant fee, high reward cards, and then it's the rest of society that has to bear that cost.\"",

    "story": [
      "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, will be Canada's next prime minister, at least for now. He will need all his experience handling global economic crises as the country faces a trade war launched by US President Donald Trump.",
      "Mark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013.",
      "He had previously steered his home country through the Great Recession as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, before being poached for Britain's top banking job.",
      "But unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he won the contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau handily. Now, he must lead the country through one of its toughest challenges yet - an escalating trade war with its biggest trading partner, the United States.",
      "But holding on to the role of PM will be a fight in and of itself. Canada's next federal election is scheduled for this October, but many expect it to be called as early as this month.",

      "Although Carney has travelled the globe, working for Goldman Sachs in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.",
      "The son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey. In 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University.",
      "In 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.",
      "In 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.",
      "Although central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them.",
      "That move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.",
      "In his time at the Bank's Threadneedle Street headquarters, he oversaw considerable changes in how the institution worked. At the start of his tenure, the Bank assumed responsibility for financial regulation after the abolition of the Financial Services Authority.",
      "He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.",
      "In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.",
      "Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.",
      "Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a monicker which stuck around long after the original controversy died down.",
      "Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.",
      "In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.",
      "Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.",
      "In the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.",
      "He described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.",
      "The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.",
      "His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Mr Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\".",
      "Carney's time at the bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.",
      "From 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.",
      "He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.",
      "He is also known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.",
      "His political ambitions have been rumoured for years, but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea.",
      "\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.",
      "Things changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.",
      "Reports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.",
      "Freeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.",
      "\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\"",
      "Still, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada.",
      "The Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.",
      "They have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets, which Carney currently does not need to do as he is not an elected member of parliament.",
      "His team has said he will comply with all applicable ethics rules and guidelines once he is prime minister."

    "story": [
      "Parents who are worried about their children being on Roblox should not let them use it, the chief executive of the gigantic gaming platform has said.",
      "The site, which is the most popular in the UK among young gamers aged eight to 12, has been dogged by claims of some children being exposed to explicit or harmful content through its games, alongside multiple reported allegations of bullying and grooming.",
      "But its co-founder and CEO Dave Baszucki insisted that the company is vigilant in protecting its users and pointed out that \"tens of millions\" of people have \"amazing experiences\" on the site.",
      "When asked what his message is to parents who don't want their children on the platform, Mr Baszucki said: \"My first message would be, if you're not comfortable, don't let your kids be on Roblox.\"",
      "\"That sounds a little counter-intuitive, but I would always trust parents to make their own decisions,\" he told BBC News in an exclusive interview.",
      "Responding to the interview, Mumsnet boss Justine Roberts said parents on the forum had spoken of how they struggled to manage their children's use of Roblox.",
      "\"There are parental controls, and our users would urge constant parental supervision,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"But we all know that with the best will in the world life sometimes gets in the way.",
      "\"If you've got multiple children you're looking after and things happen, and you probably can't 24/7 watch everything they're doing, even if you've got all your parental controls set.\"",
      "Ellie Gibson - from the Scummy Mummies podcast - said Mr Baszucki's message risked sounding \"a bit of a get out\".",
      "\"It's much easier said than done, especially when all their friends are playing it,\" she told the BBC.",
      "Gaming giant",
      "US-based Roblox is one of the world's largest games platforms, with more monthly users than Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation combined. In 2024 it averaged more than 80 million players per day \u2013 roughly 40% of them below the age of 13. Its vast empire includes some 40 million user-generated games and experiences.",
      "In the UK the Online Safety Act, which comes in to force in April, has strict laws for all tech firms specifically aimed at protecting children from online harms.",
      "But Mr Baszucki says he remains confident in Roblox's safety tools and insists the firm goes above and beyond to keep its users safe.",
      "\"We do in the company take the attitude that any bad, even one bad incident, is one too many,\" he says.",
      "\"We watch for bullying, we watch for harassment, we filter all of those kinds of things, and I would say behind the scenes, the analysis goes on all the way to, if necessary, reaching out to law enforcement.\"",
      "Players who choose not to display what he calls \"civility\" can face temporary time-outs and longer bans, and Roblox claims to analyse all communications that pass between members on the platform, increasingly using more advanced AI systems and other tech to do so \u2014 and anything flagged is sent for further investigation.",
      "In November last year, under 13s were banned from sending direct messages, and also from playing in \"hangout experiences\" which features chat between players.",
      "Safety filters bypassed",
      "However, the BBC was able to create two fake accounts, one aged 15 and one aged 27, on unlinked devices and exchange messages between the two.",
      "While the filters caught our attempts to overtly move the conversation onto a different platform, we found easy ways to re-word requests to chat elsewhere and make suggestions about playing more adult games.",
      "When we showed the Roblox boss these findings, he argued that our example highlighted the comparative safety of Roblox: that people felt they had to take content which might breach Roblox's rules to other platforms.",
      "\"We don't condone any type of image-sharing on our own platform, and you'll see us getting more and more, I think, way beyond where the law is on this type of behaviour,\" Mr Baszucki says.",
      "He admits there is a delicate balance between encouraging friendships between young people, and blocking opportunities for them come to harm, but says he is confident Roblox can manage both.",
      "We also put to him some Roblox game titles that the BBC has discovered were recommended by the platform to an 11 year-old recently, including:",
      "'Late Night Boys And Girls Club RP''Special Forces Simulator'''Squid Game''Shoot down planes\u2026because why not?'",
      "'Late Night Boys And Girls Club RP'",
      "'Special Forces Simulator''",
      "'Squid Game'",
      "'Shoot down planes\u2026because why not?'",
      "When we asked whether he thought they were appropriate, he said he puts his faith in the platform's age rating systems.",
      "\"One thing that's really important for the way we do things here, is it's not just on the title of the experience, it's literally on the content of the experience as well,\" he says.",

      "How can you keep your child safe online?",
      "Plan to make phone use safer for teens watered down",
      "Mr Baszucki founded the platform with Eric Cassel in 2004 and released it to the public in 2006 \u2013 a year before the first Apple iPhone appeared, heralding the start of the smartphone era.",
      "Mr Baszucki describes his younger self as \"less of a gamer, and more of an engineer\", and the pair's first company was an education software provider called Knowledge Revolution. But they soon noticed that kids weren't only using the product to do their homework.",
      "\"They wanted to play and build stuff. They were making houses or ships or scenery, and they wanted to jump in, and all of that learning was the germination of Roblox,\" he says.",
      "The name Roblox was a mash-up of the words \"robot\" and blocks\" \u2013 and it stuck. The platform grew quickly in popularity \u2013 and there were also early warning signs of its future issues.",
      "Mr Cassel noticed some players \"starting to act out\" and not always behaving in a \"civilised\" way a couple of months after it launched, recalls Mr Baszucki.",
      "He says the roots of building a \"trust and safety system\" therefore began \"very, very early\" and that in those earlier days there were four people acting as safety moderators.",
      "\"It kind of is what launched this safety civility foundation,\" he adds.",
      "But despite attracting decent numbers, it was a year later, when the firm launched its digital currency Robux, that it really started to make money.",
      "Players buy Robux and use it to purchase accessories and unlock content. Content creators now get 70% of the fee, and the store operates on dynamic pricing, meaning popular items cost more.",
      "Mr Baszucki says there was some initial resistance among the leadership team about Roblox becoming more than a hobby for its players, with the introduction of a digital economy.",
      "Robux stayed, and the firm is now worth $41bn (\u00a331bn).",
      "Its share price has fluctuated since it went public in 2021, but overall Roblox shares are worth about one third more than they were six months ago, at the time of writing. Like many big tech firms its value peaked during Covid, when lockdowns meant millions of people were indoors.",
      "Mr Baszucki compares his experience of building Roblox with how Walt Disney may have felt about his creations.",
      "He describes his job as \"a little like having the opportunity he had a long time ago when he was designing the Magic Kingdom\", and is focused on Roblox's ongoing evolution into a Metaverse-style experience where people go about their daily lives in a virtual world, in avatar form.",
      "They have also been public in their ambitions to eventually attract 10% of the world's gamers.",
      "Asked to describe Roblox in three words, he replies: \"The future of communication.\"",
      "We finish our time together playing a couple of his favourite games: Natural Disaster Survival and Dress to Impress.",

    "summary": "The film is being released as debate continues about the way dwarfs re represented",
    "story": [
      "Disney's live-action remake of Snow White is set to be released in UK cinemas next week, marking the latest efforts by the film studio to revive a beloved old classic.",
      "But the film, which stars Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot, has faced several issues throughout its production.",
      "The movie is being released amid a debate about how the seven dwarfs are represented on screen, while Zegler has made headlines for critical comments about the original 1937 film.",
      "The European premiere was held on Wednesday at a castle in Northern Spain, instead of a more traditional and high-profile location such as London's Leicester Square.",
      "Dwarfism debate",
      "The debate around the film began making headlines in January 2022, when Game of Thrones star Peter Dinklage, an actor with Dwarfism, described the decision to retell the story of \"seven dwarfs living in a cave\" as \"backward\".",
      "Disney has used computer-generated dwarfs in the remake and said it would \"avoid reinforcing stereotypes from the original animated film\".",
      "But this week, other actors with Dwarfism have said they would have liked the opportunity to play the roles.",
      "Speaking to the Daily Mail, performer Choon Tan said the decision to use CGI was \"absolutely absurd and discriminating in a sense\".",
      "\"There really is nothing wrong casting someone with dwarfism as a dwarf in any given opportunity,\" he said.",
      "\"As long as we are treated equally and with respect, we're usually more than happy to take on any acting roles that are suitable for us,\" he added.",
      "Another performer, Blake Johnston, told the newspaper that \"we have plenty of dwarf actors out there who are dying for roles like this\".",
      "He said he also said he believed Disney had \"succumb to peer pressure on political correctness, which has now given top dwarf actors less work\".",
      "Dinklage, who has a form of dwarfism called achondroplasia, criticised the film in 2022 during an interview with podcaster Marc Maron.",
      "\"I was a little taken aback by [the fact] they were very proud to cast a Latina actress as Snow White,\" he said, referring to Colombian-American actress Zegler.",
      "\"You're progressive in one way, but then you're still making that backward story about seven dwarfs living in a cave together? Have I done nothing to advance the cause from my soapbox? I guess I'm not loud enough.\"",
      "The actor had previously spoken about the representation of dwarfism, saying it was \"bad writing\" to make it a \"dominant character trait\".",
      "In a statement released after Dinklage's comments, Disney said they were \"taking a different approach with these seven characters\" and had made their decision to use CGI after \"consulting with members of the dwarf community\".",
      "Pared-down premiere",
      "The film's European premiere took place on Wednesday at a remote castle in Spain, which was the inspiration behind the castle in the 1937 original animated film.",
      "Zegler performed a rendition of original song Waiting On a Wish at the event on Wednesday evening in Segrovia, north-West of Madrid.",
      "Most media outlets were not invited to the medieval castle, and Zegler instead performed to a relatively small crowd.",
      "The Los Angeles premiere, meanwhile, will be reportedly smaller than usual for a film of this magnitude, with the stars only expected to pose for photographs and speak to Disney's in-house crews.",
      "News journalists have not been invited to attend the red carpet and therefore will not have the opportunity to interview the film's cast and creatives.",
      "However, the cast are taking part in a few select sit-down interviews with some outlets as part of a press junket which is taking place this week.",
      "Other controversies",
      "The debate about the seven dwarfs is not the only controversy which has surrounded the film, which has reportedly cost \u00a3217m to make.",
      "Early in the film's production, there was controversy around Disney's decision to cast Zegler, a Latina actress, in the role of a character deemed to have skin \"as white as snow\".",
      "It was part of a drive by Disney to cast a more diverse range of actors to play updated versions of some classic characters.",
      "Halle Bailey, a black actress, was cast in another recent Disney live-action movie, The Little Mermaid. Both actresses faced abuse online after their casting was announced.",
      "Zegler also made headlines after she made critical comments about some elements of the previous animated film.",
      "\"The original cartoon came out in 1937, and very evidently so,\" Zegler said in 2022. \"There's a big focus [in the original] on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her. Weird! So we didn't do that this time.\"",
      "Zegler also called the original film \"extremely dated when it comes to the ideas of women being in roles of power,\" adding: \"People are making these jokes about ours being the PC Snow White, where it's like, yeah, it is - because it needed that.\"",
      "Elsewhere, fans have speculated that there may have been a behind-the-scenes rift between Zegler and Gadot, who plays the wicked stepmother, because the actresses have opposing views on the Israel-Palestine conflict.",
      "Zegler has publicly taken a pro-Palestine stance, whilst Gadot is Israeli and served in the country's army for two years.",
      "However, others have said rumours of a rift are misguided, noting Gadot and Zegler have appeared publicly together on several occasions, including when they jointly presented an award at last week's Oscars.",
      "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is the latest in a long line of classic animated Disney stories which have been remade as live-action films.",
      "Other recent live-action remakes the studio has produced include Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid, The Lion King, Dumbo and The Jungle Book.",

    "story": [
      "Spotify paid the music industry $10bn (\u00a37.7bn) in 2024, which the streaming service said was the highest annual payment from any single retailer in history.",
      "But the figures come as a heated debate continues about how much money artists and songwriters receive in royalties.",
      "Earlier this year, several Grammy-nominated songwriters boycotted an awards event hosted by Spotify in a row about their streaming earnings.",
      "As the new figures were published, a spokesperson for Spotify said the responsibility for distributing the money it pays lay with record labels and publishers.",
      "The company said it pays royalties to rights holders, adding that it does not have \"visibility\" on where the money ultimately goes because earnings are based on artists' individual contracts with their labels.",
      "A spokesperson said: \"Spotify does not pay artists or songwriters directly. We pay rights-holders, these are typically record labels, music publishers, collection societies.",
      "\"These rights-holders then pay artists and songwriters based on their individual agreements.\"",
      "The amount of money earned by artists will vary, but the BPI noted the average royalty rate for UK artists signed to major labels was around 26%, according to a 2021 study from the Competition and Markets Authority.",
      "As a result, the performer ultimately earns about 16% of a stream's overall value.",
      "However, Spotify is not the only streaming service to generate revenue for artists, and many pop stars make more money from other income streams such as live tours.",
      "Spotify said more than two-thirds of all music revenue goes \"straight to the recording and publishing rights-holders\", and added that, like other streamers, Spotify does not pay on a per-stream basis.",
      "The annual figures were published in Spotify's Loud and Clear report - part of the company's aim to provide transparency on how it pays the music industry.",
      "The amount Spotify paid this year was an increase on the more than $9bn (\u00a37bn) it handed over in 2023.",
      "The report highlighted that the number of artists generating annual royalties between $1,000 (\u00a3770) and $10m had tripled since 2017.",
      "Taylor Swift was named Spotify's top artist globally with more than 26 billion streams, in the year she released her double-length album The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology.",
      "Swift herself was part of the debate about streaming royalties in 2014, when she removed her music from Spotify as part of a boycott, eventually re-joining the platform in 2017.",
      "More recent artist boycotts have generally been prompted by other factors, such as Neil Young and Joni Mitchell removing their music over the streamer's employment of podcast host Joe Rogan. Both artists returned to the platform last year.",

      "\"The Hippodrome was the most complicated and detailed one I've made, it took me around six weeks to make.\"",

      "Between the late 1800s and it's closure in 1959, the Alhambra suffered four separate fires.",

      "The building was demolished and rebuilt a number of times.",
      "\"As these places go, they kept getting burnt down or demolished and rebuilt again - there's always a renewal aspect to them.\"",
      "The Theatre Royal was to be Belfast's \"higher class establishment\", which in the end became \"a mixed-use building of shops and place called the 'boom boom room', which was like a dance hall upstairs, which then became the starlight ballroom upstairs\".",
      "\"Now,  there's a little Starbucks in the corner where the building stood,\" he added.",
      "The Empire - 'stayed true to theatre'",
      "Not to be mistaken with the pub and music hall on Botanic Avenue, The Empire Theatre was situated on Victoria Square and opened to the public in 1894.",
      "According to Mr Marshall, the Empire \"operated at a similar time to the Alhambra from the 1890s up until the early 1960s, and then it was it was knocked down.",
      "\"It was eventually replaced by a Little Woods department store, which has been redeveloped again and again, until finally becoming Victoria Square shopping centre.\"",
      "While it did adapt to the growing popularity of cinema, The Empire \"stayed true to theatre for all of its life\", Mr Marshall said.",
      "The Hippodrome - 'Cinema in mind'",
      "The Hippodrome was \"more fiddly [model to make] than some of the other ones\".",
      "Mr Marshall describes how there aren't too many quality photographs of the Hippodrome, so he \"had to use his judgement\" when designing the model in terms of colour scheme and scale.",
      "Coming quite late, the \"Hippodrome was was built in 1907 originally with a cinema in mind\" as to take full advantage of the advent of modern cinema and growing popularity of picture shows.",
      "The Ritz - 'The Stones, The Beatles...'",
      "\"And then there was the Ritz...\" which opened in 1938.",
      "The Ritz was, according to Mr Marshall, \"a giant cinema more or less, but it called itself the Ritz Theatre\". However, it did produce shows as part of the night's entertainment.",
      "\"They would have a brass band, dancers or a ballet, and then a film at the end.\"",
      "\"It also did huge concerts, people like the Stones, The Beatles and Billy Connolly all performed at the Ritz during their time,\" he added.",
      "It was the biggest in Northern Ireland at the time, with just over 2,000 capacity.",

    "summary": "The actor may not have known his wife was dead inside the home he was living in because of the disease.",
    "story": [
      "Actor Gene Hackman was alone.",
      "The two-time Academy Award winner didn't make any calls and missed meals.",
      "Medical experts say it's possible the 95-year-old, who was in declining health and suffering from advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, did not even realise his wife of more than 30 years was dead in the home where he was living.",
      "If he did, experts told the BBC, he likely went through various stages of confusion and grief, trying to wake her up before the disease caused him to become distracted or too overwhelmed to act - a process that likely repeated for days before he, too, died.",
      "Officials in New Mexico say Betsy Arakawa, 65, died of a rare virus about seven days before Hackman perished on 18 February of natural causes.",
      "The pair - and one of their dogs - were found dead in their Santa Fe home after neighbourhood security conducted a welfare check and saw their bodies on the ground through a window.",
      "Authorities, at first, said the grim discovery was \"suspicious enough\" to launch an investigation.",
      "Their remains were discovered in advanced stages of decomposition. Arakawa was found in a bathroom with scattered pills nearby. Hackman was found near the kitchen with a cane and sunglasses. One of their three dogs was found dead in a crate.",
      "But a police investigation found no foul play.",
      "Instead, the case has shed light on the grim realities of Alzheimer's disease, which damages and destroys cells in one's brain over time - taking away memory and other important mental functions.",
      "\"It's like he was living in a reel,\" Catherine V Piersol, PhD, an occupational therapist with decades of experience in dementia care, told the BBC of how Hackman may have experienced the repeated loss of his wife.",
      "She noted patients with advanced Alzheimer's disease like the actor live in the present and are unable to both look back at moments in the past or look forward and act.",
      "\"I imagine he would be trying to wake her up and not being successful. But then [he] could have been distracted in another room because of one of the dogs or something,\" she described.",
      "Then later, he'd again notice his wife on the ground and would \"live through it again\", she said.",
      "Though no one knows how Hackman spent his last days alive, the grim nature of the possibilities were discussed by authorities and the area's medical examiner.",
      "At a press conference last week, Dr Heather Jarrell, New Mexico's chief medical examiner, said Arakawa died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a respiratory illness caused by exposure to infected rodents. Hackman's death was the result of significant heart disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a contributing factor.",
      "Given Hackman's advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, it is \"quite possible that he was not aware that she [his wife] was deceased\", Dr Jarrell said.",
      "His autopsy indicated he had not eaten recently, though he showed no signs of dehydration. Officials found no evidence that he had communicated with anyone after his wife's death and could not determine whether he was able to care for himself.",
      "Ms Piersol said patients with advanced Alzheimer's aren't able to pick up on environmental cues like light and darkness, making it harder to determine when he should eat, sleep or bathe.",
      "\"Those [cues] are oftentimes just, no longer available to people at this stage of dementia,\" she said.",
      "Dr Brendan Kelley, a neurologist who specialises in memory and cognition at UT Southwestern Medical Center, explained why Hackman may also not have been able to call authorities for help. He said Alzheimer's disease can leave patients caught between emotional discomfort and the inability to act on it.",
      "\"A person might feel worried or frightened, but at the same time they might not be capable to take the actions that you or I might normally think to do in order to alleviate that worry or concern, such as calling somebody else, or going to speak to a neighbour.\"",
      "Dr Kelley says Alzheimer's patients experience emotions like pain and sadness, and experience physical needs like hunger and thirst, it's just harder for them to identify what they are feeling.",
      "He said missing meals could also increase levels of confusion and agitation.",
      "The couple's deaths and the startling details of Hackman living in the home for a week after his wife's passing has shocked the Santa Fe area, where the couple had lived for more than 20 years.",
      "\"It's just absolutely devastating,\" says Jeffery Gomez, a long-time resident of the city, who remembers seeing Hackman around town in his different cars, always with a smile on his face.",
      "His partner, Linda, said the details were triggering, explaining she cared for her elderly mother with dementia. \"Even when you have help, it's a lot,\" she said.",
      "\"We know Gene and his wife were very private people and she was probably trying to shield him from the public,\" she added, \"but the thought of doing that alone? It's a lot to shoulder.\"",
      "Laura N Gitlin, PhD, a behavioural scientist who researches ways to support caregivers told the BBC, this is becoming a common problem among caregivers.",
      "\"With the aging of a population, we also simultaneously have a shrinking of the number of people in the family, number of children, or relatives who live nearby,\" she explained.",
      "Ms Gitlin noted along with there being fewer caregivers, there is less support for these individuals on making big decisions - such as when it's time to place a loved one in a home instead of caring for them by yourself.",
      "Jeffery Gomez said he couldn't understand how no one checked in on the couple for such a long while.",

    "summary": "The Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni feud has shone a light on a part of the entertainment industry that many of those within it would rather remain invisible.",
    "story": [
      "The lawsuits between actors Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni have shed light on a secretive group of people in Hollywood who operate behind the scenes to keep a lid on fallouts and scandals. But in recent years their role has shifted - and their challenges multiplied",
      "Listen to Steven read this article.",
      "\"She's a phony, but I guess the public likes that\u2026\" This is the line that actress Joan Crawford is said to have declared about film star Bette Davis.",
      "The back-and-forth sniping between the pair played out in public in the 1930s and 40s. \"Bette is a survivor... She survived herself,\" Crawford also apparently remarked.",
      "Their tempestuous relationship was so notorious that in 2017 it was made into an Emmy award-winning TV series, Feud.",
      "Hollywood rivalries are of course nothing new \u2013 yet conflicts today rarely play out so publicly. That might be why the dispute between actors Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, which spilled out into the open in December 2024, is still in the headlines three months on.",
      "The subsequent legal battle brought to light a fallout during production of the film It Ends With Us. After the promotional and cinematic run had ended, the pair \u2013 who didn't appear on the red carpet together at the premiere in New York \u2013 filed lawsuits against each other.",
      "Lively has accused Baldoni and others of carrying out a smear campaign against her after she complained about alleged sexual harassment on set. Baldoni, meanwhile, has accused Lively, her husband Ryan Reynolds and their publicist of carrying out a smear campaign against him, and claims that she tried to take over control of the film. Both sides deny all allegations.",
      "What emerged as this all played out is that crisis PR managers had been employed. Legal representatives for Lively obtained numerous text messages between Baldoni's publicist Jennifer Abel and the crisis team he retained, led by Melissa Nathan, whose previous clients include Johnny Depp and Drake. Ms Nathan was alleged to have texted Ms Abel, \"You know we can bury anyone.\"",
      "Lively has now reportedly taken on the CIA's former deputy chief of staff Nick Shapiro to advise on her legal communications strategy.",
      "While the outcomes of the lawsuits remain to be seen, the feud has cast the spotlight on an industry that would ordinarily remain largely invisible: that is, the publicity machine at work behind the scenes in Hollywood.",
      "\"On every set, there are fights, liaisons\u2026 there are all sorts of things that go on,\" explains Richard Rushfield, founder and columnist at Hollywood newsletter The Ankler. \"Hollywood is a world full of very messy people coming together for these giant projects, where they put together teams quickly to make these things and disband immediately after.",
      "\"Between all that a lot of stuff goes on, and they deal with it quietly \u2013 they're very obsessive about controlling the narrative. When this stuff explodes into the public, beyond control, it makes everyone very nervous.\"",
      "But the world of the Hollywood PR has shifted in recent years, partly because of the growth of social media, which has changed the relationship between celebrities and fans, bringing them into direct contact and removing some of the mystique.",
      "So, what does that mean for the people whose job it is to keep a lid on the industry's messy reality?",
      "From Tom Hardy to Sarah Jessica Parker",
      "Few fallouts have spilled out into the open in recent years \u2013 and those that did were picked over simply because they're so rare. Actor Dwayne Johnson revealed \"a fundamental difference in philosophies on how we approach moviemaking and collaborating\" with his Fast & Furious co-star Vin Diesel, in a 2018 interview.",
      "The stars of another action film, Mad Max: Fury Road, Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy, are reported to have filmed many of their scenes separately.",
      "And then there were the alleged tensions between Kim Cattrall and Sarah Jessica Parker, who were co-stars of Sex and the City, which ran for six years. In 2018, after Parker offered condolences for Cattrall's brother's death, Cattrall responded on social media, calling Parker a \"hypocrite\" and stating, \"You are not my family. You are not my friend.\"",
      "But behind the scenes, hundreds of other spats will never see the light of day. \"Some of a publicist's best work may never be seen,\" says Daniel Bee, a publicist and brand consultant based in Los Angeles, \"because it stopped something that was wrong, or re-crafted something to a different narrative, or pointed the light in a different direction.",
      "\"The most interesting stuff I've ever done as a publicist is the stuff nobody will ever know about.\"",
      "'Powerful forces at play'",
      "Since Daniel Bee started out as an entertainment publicist in 1997, he has observed a shift in the wider industry. \"I started my career in the British media, there were 11 national newspapers competing with each other. It was a bear pit, hard work, and it was getting to know individuals via relationships.",
      "\"Now, you're up against an anonymous algorithm and accounts where you don't know who you're up against. It's harder to control than ever before.\"",
      "Certainly, social media has posed challenges for those attempting to control narratives around major films and their stars \u2013 while also heralding new forms of \"dark arts\" through which publicists can attempt to shape opinion.",
      "Dating apps could be in trouble \u2013 here's what might take their place",
      "Nasa needs saving from itself \u2013 but is this billionaire right for that job?",
      "Sneaky Britain? How our moral compasses are changing",
      "\"There has always been an army of advisors and consultants doing PR voodoo,\" says Eriq Gardner, entertainment law expert and founding partner of Puck News. \"While I'd love to say the public is media-literate and savvy enough to read between the lines to see the spin, the truth is there are a lot of powerful forces at play and sometimes a large amount of misinformation.\"",
      "So-called PR voodoo is different now that a celebrity \u2013 or their fans \u2013 can access an audience of millions with a click.",
      "While the publicists of previous eras might only have had to worry about print and broadcast platforms, smartphones and social media mean today's digital landscape is a wild west where anyone can shape their own narrative. A badly judged post or comment can damage an actor's career.",
      "But the flipside is a whole new medium in which PRs can practise their \"voodoo\".",
      "Astroturfing and ways to 'cause mischief'",
      "One of the tactics is \"astroturfing\" \u2013 or disguising an orchestrated campaign as a spontaneous up-swelling of public opinion.",
      "This works by manipulating public opinion and creating a false impression of grassroots support (hence the name) or opposition, often coordinated through social media accounts in a way that seems organic.",
      "The practice isn't new, but has been given new life with the advent of social media algorithms.",
      "\"It's deliberately planting disinformation, or twisted versions of the truth, in certain sections of social media,\" says Carla Speight, founder of the PR Mastery app. \"The aim is the halfway point of influential where they will get a bit of traction, but so that it's not too obvious \u2013 you wouldn't hire a Kardashian to do it.",
      "\"It's built up in layers,\" she continues. \"It's like playing a very sinister game of chess. You're putting all the pieces in the right places, just the right amount of mixed-up information, and then you just watch it explode.\"",
      "Although the posts might appear to be genuine public opinion, in fact it's a faked crowd \u2013 whether that's made up of bots or real people, who can be paid to coordinate their posts.",
      "\"All it takes is one or two people to create a meme and put it with the right people,\" says Ms Speight. \"It needs to appear as a trend, and then it's gone. Something is dripped here, something else over there, and when it's done well\u2026 it causes a bit of mischief.\"",
      "Reinventing an age-old tactic?",
      "But all of this is simply a new platform for an age-old trend that has been going on long before the advent of social media, according to Mr Bee. \"Undetected smear campaigns have always been a thing,\" he points out.",
      "\"Previously it would have been a publicist whispering to a diarist of a national newspaper. The issue with digital media is it's anonymous and untraceable.\"",
      "What has changed, he continues, is that audiences have become savvier. \"Whereas before, a quite subservient audience would just take what was given to them in the media, with natural scepticism, curiosity, and a greater level of information, I think people use more critical thinking.\"",
      "Eriq Gardner is less convinced: \"I'm not sure the public approaches what they read with enough scepticism.\"",
      "And yet those in the industry are often alert to it. According to Ms Speight, \"Usually, there's a distinct sort of tell, and it may be the PR thing where we have 'spidey senses' and we can sort of see it, but you're asking, 'Where has that come from? Who started that?' And when there's never a specific place to point it to, that's usually a tell-tale sign.\"",
      "The Hollywood ecosystem",
      "What's clear, though, is that, with studios providing some publications with significant advertising revenue, as well as supplying talent for special events and front covers, revelations often emerge elsewhere in the media.",
      "\"When [scandals] come out, it's usually from places outside of Hollywood,\" argues Mr Rushfield. \"The Harvey Weinstein story was broken by The New York Times and the New Yorker.\"",
      "It was The New York Times that first reported Lively's legal complaint in December. \"It's one of the few places that can afford to do that, and then everyone else jumped in so nobody was sticking their neck out.\" Baldoni filed a $250 million lawsuit against the New York Times in December, although a federal judge indicated this week that it might be dismissed.",
      "Even when bigger outlets break news about Hollywood disputes, the growing dominance of social media means that stories might not have the same cut-through they had previously.",
      "Doreen St Felix, a writer who was previously an editor on Lena Dunham's newsletter, recently wrote in The New Yorker that stories of harassment and abuse, for example, now receive a \"curdled, cynical, and exhausted reception\" \u2013 this, less than a decade after the emergence of the MeToo movement.",
      "She went on to claim that: \"The late 2010s genre of #MeToo reportage cannot thrive on today's volatile internet. Information is misinformation and vice versa. Victims are offenders and offenders are victims.\"",
      "Sometimes, however, the best way for publicists to prevent stories being amplified is by bypassing social media entirely when reacting to a scandal.",
      "\"If you give it to the press first, they don't quote as many of the comments on social media,\" says Ms Speight. \"You control the narrative completely, because the comments come afterwards.\"",
      "Mr Rushfield points out that very little of the revelations in the entertainment press comes out because someone \"uncovered\" something. \"Almost everything you read is there because somebody placed it there \u2013 somebody is dictating a story.\"",
      "What viewers want",
      "None of this industry would exist if the appetite weren't there and if the viewing public didn't want to unpick details about their lives \u2013 and rifts. And yet attitudes towards celebrity have undoubtedly changed since the advent of social media.",
      "\"It's now a two-way communication, which it never was before,\" points out Mr Bee. \"It was generally celebrities, or lawyer or government or whatever, just saying something that gets reported, and that message is conveyed. Now, you have to be prepared for a two-way conversation.\"",
      "But he thinks there are different attitudes to the media today than in the era of celebrity gossip magazines. Nodding to the UK, he continues: \"We had the Leveson Inquiry, we're about to get an ITV drama about phone hacking \u2013 it's as if the curtain has been lifted.\"",
      "As for the Lively and Baldoni lawsuits, it's not clear how these will play out \u2013 but the very fact that it has so unusually spilled into the public domain is a reminder of how well-oiled the Hollywood publicity machine is the rest of the time. And that is unlikely to change soon.",

      "The organisation, which oversees the country's health service, will be brought into the Department of Health, and the PM said the move would free up money for frontline services.",
      "The government said it expected around 50% of the jobs at NHS England, which as of December had 14,400 staff, and the Department of Health, which has 3,500 staff, to go.",
      "In a speech in Hull, Sir Keir said for too long politicians had \"chosen to hide behind vast arrays of quangos\" - organisations funded by taxpayers but not directly controlled by the government.",
      "The government said work would begin immediately to return many of NHS England's current functions to the Department of Health and Social Care, with the aim of completing the process in two years.",
      "The significant move gives the government more control and accountability over one of their key pledges - to cut NHS waiting times.",
      "NHS England - which the government dubbed \"the world's largest quango\" - oversees the health service, working with government to agree funding and priorities, as well as monitoring the performance of local NHS services.",
      "It was given autonomy by the then-Conservative Health Secretary Andrew Lansley in 2012, with the aim of freeing the organisation from interference by politicians.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the changes would \"liberate\" frontline workers from excessive and \"competing directions\".",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM programme, he said the result would be \"better value for taxpayers and better outcomes for patients because the hundreds of millions of pounds we can save will be redeployed to the front line delivering better care\".",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch welcomed the move to bring the management of the health service back under ministerial control, but warned Labour \"cannot hide if things go wrong\".",
      "She did not have \"high hopes\" because Labour already ran the NHS in Wales and that was \"doing a lot worse than the rest of the country\", she said.",
      "Liberal Democrat  leader Sir Ed Davey backed the plans, but argued they were not the main issue for the NHS.",
      "To fix it, the government needed to focus on \"getting more GPs, more NHS dentists, more community pharmacists, making sure that social care actually works\", he said.",
      "The Health Foundation think tank warned the reorganisation would distract senior leaders.",
      "And Sharon Graham, head of the Unite union, said: \"Taking an axe to these jobs is an ill-thought-out strategy that could end up meaning frontline healthcare staff struggle to do their jobs effectively if they aren't paid on time, don't have basic medical supplies or are forced to do additional administrative work rather than treat patients.\"",
      "The news comes after senior NHS England figures including chief executive Amanda Pritchard and medical director Sir Stephen Powis announced they were stepping down.",
      "Live updates: Starmer to scrap NHS England and bring health service back under 'democratic control'",
      "NHS England: Why world's biggest quango is being axed",
      "Could Starmer's regulation shake-up mean a 'bonfire of the quangos'?",
      "The announcement came as part of a wider speech on reforming the state, which Sir Keir described as \"overstretched\" and \"unfocused\".",
      "\"Over a number of years politicians have chosen to hide behind vast arrays of quangos, arm's length bodies, regulators, reviews,\" the prime minister said.",
      "\"A sort of cottage industry of checkers and blockers using taxpayer money to stop the government delivering on taxpayer priorities.\"",
      "The number of quangos has fallen by more than half since 2010 but there are still more than 300 across the UK.",
      "They include regulators, cultural institutions and advisory bodies, ranging from large organisations like NHS England, to smaller ones like the Gambling Commission and the British Film Institute.",
      "The water regulator Ofwat could be among other government quangos in line to be scrapped.",
      "Ofwat's role - along with the Environment Agency, the Drinking Water Inspectorate and Natural Resources Wales - is among the organisations already being looked at in a review of the whole water system in England and Wales, by an Independent Water Commission established last year.",
      "Government sources would not pre-empt the outcome of the review but all options for regulating water are understood to be on the table, except nationalising water companies.",
      "The new Labour government has set up more than 20 new quangos since winning power.",
      "These include Great British Energy, which will invest in renewable energy to help meet the government's clean power goals, and Skills England, which aims to support people to find jobs.",
      "The government has also suggested it wants to cut the size of the Civil Service, which has a headcount of more than 500,000.",
      "Civil servants are politically impartial officials employed by the government, covering areas including policy development and services like benefits and prisons.",
      "In his speech, Sir Keir linked the need to reshape government to global instability which has pushed up bills at home, saying the state needs to be operating at \"maximum strength\".",
      "He promised to cut the costs of regulation for businesses by 25% to boost economic growth.",
      "His plan also includes greater use of artificial intelligence, underpinned by the mantra that civil servants should not be spending time on tasks where digital or AI can do it better and quicker.",
      "Earlier this year, Sir Keir faced a backlash saying \"too many people in Whitehall are comfortable in the tepid bath of managed decline\".",
      "In his speech he was keen to stress his criticism was not aimed at individuals but the system as a whole.",
      "Having spent the last few weeks focused on diplomatic wrangling over Ukraine, the speech saw the prime minister return to domestic challenges - specifically a feeling that services in the country do not work well enough.",
      "It also reflected growing concern in Downing Street that there are too many organisations that ministers can not directly control.",
      "For the public, the key question will be whether these changes result in any perceptible improvement.",
      "Former head of the Civil Service Lord [Gus] O'Donnell told the BBC the government's messaging to civil servants was \"nothing short of disastrous\".",
      "Speaking on Radio 4's PM programme, he referenced Sir Keir's \"tepid bath\" comment and a government briefing to the Guardian on Wednesday saying \"they wanted to do 'project chainsaw'. Trying to be a mini Elon Musk?\".",
      "He described these remarks as \"absolutely ridiculous\" and \"really damaging\" for the prime minister and what he wanted to achieve.",
      "Mike Clancy, head of the Prospect trade union, which represents civil servants, agreed reform was needed but added: \"The government must recognise that there is a fine line between cutting back bureaucracy and undermining the essential functions of the state.\"",
      "\"Civil servants in agencies such as HSE [Health and Safety Executive] and the Environment Agency are at the frontline of delivering on the government's missions - writing them off as 'blockers' is a profound mistake.\"",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93nvvw1x20o",
    "published": "Thu, 13 Mar 2025 15:39:07 GMT",
    "summary": "There are three main reasons body is going - money, bureaucracy and control, says Nick Triggle",
    "story": [
      "The body responsible for the day-to-day running of the health service in England is being scrapped.",
      "The government plans to abolish NHS England and bring it into the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) in a radical overhaul of the management structure of the NHS.",
      "Why? The government argues it will save money, cut red-tape and give ministers more control. But the move is not without risk.",
      "With more than 14,000 staff, NHS England is around four times the size of the DHSC itself.",
      "But that is only because in recent years NHS England has absorbed Health Education England, which oversees staff training, and NHS Digital, which is responsible for data collection and technology.",
      "NHS England also plays a role in organising some key frontline services, including GPs and specialist hospital care, while overseeing the day-to-day running of the health service alongside distributing the money made available by ministers.",
      "Much of this will now fall under the control of the health department. But not all. Expect some to be devolved down to regional health boards.",
      "Nonetheless, it is expected to lead to half of the jobs at the two organisations going \u2013 around 9,000 roles.",
      "That is expected to save at least \u00a3500m a year. While the sum sounds a lot, it is around 0.25% of the health budget. The respected King's Fund think-tank has called it a \"drop in the ocean\" that will not go very far on the frontline.",
      "Bureaucratic monster",
      "But this is also about reducing bureaucracy \u2013 something that can't really be measured in numbers.",
      "In his address to the House of Commons, Streeting cited one organisation that was having to fill in 250 forms in one month to satisfy both the health department and NHS England.",
      "Reacting to the announcement on Thursday, former health secretary Jeremy Hunt told the BBC NHS England has become a \"bureaucratic monster\" that stifles innovation.",
      "Could Starmer's regulation shake-up mean a 'bonfire of the quangos'?",
      "And talk to those doing the work in hospitals and other frontline services, one of the most common complaints is that NHS England was incredibly controlling, even requesting individual NHS trusts ask for permission for something as mundane as granting media interviews.",
      "But make no mistake this is also about control. It was a point made clear by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer when he set out the plan, which could take two years to fully implement.",
      "He said it was only right that a democratically-elected government was in charge of day-to-day running of the health service.",
      "Significant risk",
      "Quangos - \"quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations\" - are set up by government to oversee regulations and operate independently from politicians.",
      "NHS England was created as part of the 2012 reforms introduced under former Tory health secretary Andrew Lansley.",
      "The idea was to free the health service from political meddling \u2013 with ministers instead setting the wider strategy, but stepping back from getting involved on a daily basis.",
      "In the years afterwards NHS England has exercised that independence. This was  most notable under the leadership of Sir Simon Stevens, who challenged and pressed the Theresa May government into increasing funding.",
      "In the late 2010s, after Lansley had left government, Conservative health ministers privately expressed frustration that the single-biggest part of their brief was outside of their control.",
      "As soon as Streeting took charge at the DHSC last summer, it was clear he felt the same and NHS England was on borrowed time.",
      "On Monday it was announced half of the roles at NHS England would go \u2013 and that came after the current chief executive, Amanda Pritchard, and a number of her top managers announced they would be stepping down.",
      "But given Labour, in opposition, was critical of the Tories messing around with NHS structures, embarking on its own reorganisation comes with significant risk. Hospital bosses are already warning this will cause disruption.",
      "And the public are understandably asking what difference this will make to the care they receive. The government says it will help it improve services and reduce waiting times \u2013 and, given that is one of its top priorities, there will be no hiding place now."

    "summary": "As part of Your Voice, Your BBC, we answer questions from you on government plans to scrap NHS England.",
    "story": [
      "The government has announced NHS England will be abolished to \"cut bureaucracy\" and reform how the National Health Service is run.",
      "The changes will not impact anyone's access to the NHS - it will still be free at the point of use and cover all the services it does already.",
      "Around 9,000 administrative roles are being cut at NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care as part of the changes - amounting to roughly half of all roles at the two organisations.",
      "As part of Your Voice Your BBC, we asked for your questions on the plans and what they could mean for you - below we have answered them for you.",
      "What does NHS England do?",
      "NHS England is the administrative body which manages how health services up and down the country are run. It is made up primarily of managers and officials, not the doctors and nurses providing care in hospitals.",
      "The government provides it with money and tells it what its priorities are for the health service - for example, that might be cutting waiting times or improving cancer survival rates.",
      "NHS England's role is to funnel the money it is given into different parts of the health service and work out how to juggle resources in order to bring about the change the government wants to see.",
      "In 2012, NHS England was given more independence by the Conservative-led government. They said doing so would prevent politicians from interfering too much in how front line services are run - but critics say that change has made it harder to carry out reform or drive improvement.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer believes that overhauling management structures will put NHS in England \"back into democratic control\" and free up money for front-line services.",
      "NHS England is also responsible for other functions like overseeing training and collecting data, as well as managing GP services.",
      "There are separate organisations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, so these changes only impact England.",
      "Did this decision come out of the blue?",
      "Within the NHS and Westminster, the writing has been on the wall for NHS England for some months.",
      "Even in the latter years of the Tory government, health ministers expressed frustration that they were not in charge of the day-to-day running of the health service.",
      "When Labour came into power, it was clear Health Secretary Wes Streeting wanted more control of the NHS and saw a lot of duplication and bureaucracy.",
      "NHS England's chief executive Amanda Pritchard recently said she would step down at the end of the March and a number of her senior leadership team have followed suit.",
      "In that respect, it was clear there was going to be significant reform - but this is as big a change as you could possibly get at the heart of the NHS management structure.",
      "What is a 'quango' - and why do ministers think 'bureaucracy' is a problem?",
      "These are two words we have heard the government use a lot when setting out why it is scrapping NHS England and bringing the health service under closer government control.",
      "In this context, bureaucracy is a stand-in word for a system that is particularly complicated, or requires excessive amounts of administration, paperwork, regulations or layers of management.",
      "Starmer made it clear he thinks this sort of admin is getting in the way of delivering health services.",
      "We also heard him describe NHS England as the \"world's largest quango\" - a term that stands for Quasi-Autonomous Non-Governmental Organisation.",
      "Could Starmer's regulation shake-up mean a 'bonfire of the quangos'?",
      "In short, quangos are bodies like regulators and advisory groups, which are funded by taxpayers but not directly controlled by central government. They do things on behalf of the government, but are not directly controlled by ministers.",
      "They range from big organisations like NHS England, Network Rail and the Environment Agency to smaller ones like the British Film Institute and Gambling Commission.",
      "Their numbers have fallen by more than half since 2010 because David Cameron's coalition government abolished nearly 300 - but there are still more than 300 across the UK.",
      "Labour has set up more than 20 since winning the election last July, including Great British Energy and Skills England.",
      "The total budget for quangos in 2022/23 - when the latest figures were published - was \u00a3353bn.",
      "Will there be more control over decision-making and budgets locally?",
      "We do not yet know all of the detail about how health services in England will be managed in the future but it is likely that some of the responsibilities NHS England currently holds will be devolved down to regional bodies.",
      "One of the arguments being made about NHS reform is that if you move decision-making down to a local level and nearer to patients, it will be health leaders who are more attuned to the needs of patients in the area making those calls.",
      "They will know what local populations need and where the weaknesses are - and that, in theory, could improve services for patients in different parts of the country.",
      "Will this mean an increase in funding to the NHS and better access to medicines?",
      "Thursday's announcement was not about funding - that is expected in the summer.",
      "We already know NHS is getting an uplift of about 3-4% next year and we do not yet know what spending will look like beyond that.",
      "But government sources believe scrapping NHS England will save the government \u00a3500m a year.",
      "On access to medicines, it is the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence - which is separate from NHS England - which sets the guidelines on what treatments are judged affordable and cost effective.",
      "When a new drug is produced by the pharmaceutical industry, the institute will decide if the NHS can afford it and whether it is better than other drugs that are used.",

      "A recent comprehensive study of PBM stated that more clinical trials on humans need to take place to fully understand how it actually works.",
      "US space agency Nasa first began studying the effect of LEDs in the 1990s to see if it could help in cell regeneration.",
      "Since then, medical-grade devices have been used by dermatologists \"for many years\", according to Dr Kentley.",
      "But at-home masks have only been on the retail market for about five years and cost a fraction of the medical devices.",
      "The main differences between medical devices and High Street masks are the strength of the LEDs, the number of bulbs on the device and how close they sit to the skin's surface when being used.",
      "LED therapy masks are 'visually interesting'",
      "Dr Justine Kluk, who runs her own dermatology clinic and specialises in treating acne, believes that while at-home masks \"sound promising\", mask wholesale manufacturers are \"speculating\" about their benefits.",
      "\"I don't believe anyone has run clinical trials of the LED mask at home to see if it is the same dose as a device you would use in a clinic or hospital,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"No-one is testing these devices in big enough sample sizes for long enough periods of time for us to feel really confident.",
      "\"So I believe the benefits from using one of these masks is probably very modest,\" she adds.",
      "Skincare makes up nearly half of all global sales in the beauty industry - and is set to continue to grow more than the likes of haircare, make-up and fragrance in the next year.",
      "This is being boosted by Generation Z (those born between 1995 and 2009) and even Generation Alpha (born 2010 to now) whose skincare fascination is said to be fuelled by social media trends.",
      "Dr Kluk says she has noticed \"that people's interest in at-home skin care and treatments has increased hugely since Covid\" and believes the \"visually interesting\" element of the at-home LED mask makes it such an eye-catching product to sell online.",
      "\"People sitting watching TV wearing a red LED mask increases people's curiosity.",
      "\"Every other consultation I've had for the last six months, has involved people asking me about LED masks,\" she adds.",
      "When you search LED masks on social media platforms such as TikTok, you will be met with hundreds of videos with users showing off their results after using one of these at-home devices.",
      "Natalie O'Neill, 29, tells the BBC she started to use a mask \"out of curiosity to see if I would notice any difference\" and did not use it to treat an existing skin condition like acne.",
      "The skincare content creator says:  \"I noticed a change in my skin after a couple of weeks and felt it prevented breakouts really well.\"",
      "She adds that the mask has helped to \"keep my skin tone looking more even\" and faded marks on her face more quickly.",
      "O'Neill was not paid to promote a particular mask and caveats all her content on this technology by saying she uses it alongside a consistent skincare routine.",
      "\"Getting red light or LED therapy in a clinic is not immediately transferable to a mask, which a lot of consumers don't realise - I'm OK with that because I have the right expectations,\" she adds.",
      "Part of the appeal of LED masks is that they are easy to use and therefore have a low barrier to entry for potential buyers.",
      "Laurence Newman is the chief executive of CurrentBody, whose at-home LED mask is one of the world's best sellers.",
      "He started selling professional equipment to clinics more than 25 years ago and began developing an at-home LED mask in 2009, bringing out the company's first device just under 10 years later.",
      "\"We see that people use it for 10 minutes and get an instant glow afterwards,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Newman says that women in particular \"are moving towards totally non-invasive skincare\" and looking for ways to improve their skin without botox and fillers.",
      "Newman says the masks his company sells have been developed using the same technology as medical devices, which have a minimum requirement light wavelengths.",
      "He emphasises that the at-home LED mask market and indeed at-home beauty technology market are in their infancy, with \"a real movement of education\" growing.",
      "'This is a lot of money to spend'",
      "Dr Kentley concludes that \"PBM is mostly considered safe, even at high levels\" so using any form of LED technology is unlikely to \"cause damage to cells\", however more research into how exactly PBM works is needed to understand what it can do.",
      "\"There have been many experimental and clinical studies into the use of PBM for various dermatologic conditions, however they have varied in the parameters of the device and treatment protocols,\" he adds.",
      "\"Many of these studies were small and unstandardised and often paid for by the manufacturers so it is difficult to draw concrete conclusions\".",
      "He says if someone is keen to buy a device they should make sure they choose one that has EU safety certifications and a high density of LED bulbs on the mask to ensure enough energy is being delivered to the skin.",
      "Dr Kluk also says that she does not \"want to discourage anyone\" who is intrigued by the technology but wants \"them to understand that this is a lot of money to spend on a device, which could potentially support a good skincare routine, or if it's severe like acne, a good prescription regimen and some lifestyle measures - but it's unlikely to do enough on its own.\"",

      "The 55-year-old, who played for 12 clubs during a professional career spanning 19 years, was diagnosed last year and the news was announced in January.",
      "Windass told BBC Newsnight he was trying not to let the illness affect him, but \"has a cry every now and then\".",
      "\"It scares me,\" he admitted. \"I don't know what the outcome's going to be. Interview me in 10 years' time and I might tell you a different story.\"",
      "Stage two dementia is an early phase of the syndrome in which people exhibit very mild cognitive decline, possibly including some memory lapses.",
      "Windass said it was \"emotional\" for him when he underwent tests and although he doesn't know what the future holds, said he was trying to live as normal a life as possible.",
      "He added: \"There's nothing I can do. You can't roll back the years, so you've just got to deal with it as much as you can.",
      "\"Hopefully, in the next five or 10 years it doesn't develop. It might do, but it might not. So, you get up in the morning and you live. You try to live your life as normal.\"",
      "Windass was part of the Bradford City side promoted to the Premier League in 1999 and wrote his name into Hull City folklore with the only goal in the Championship play-off final at Wembley in 2008.",
      "He also had stints at Aberdeen, Oxford, Middlesbrough and Sheffield United during a career that saw him amass more than 700 appearances and score more than 230 goals.",
      "\"If they'd said [when playing] that in 10 years' time you might have a shade of dementia. I'd go 'well I'm not heading that ball then',\" Windass added.",
      "\"I wouldn't have done that as much in training\u2026 [I'd] probably think twice.\"",
      "In his first broadcast interview since the diagnosis, Windass spoke candidly about the impact the news was having on his mental health and his family.",
      "He said he believed his diagnosis was a direct result of repeatedly heading the ball, and had concerns for his two sons, Josh and Jordan, both of whom are footballers.",
      "\"I don't want them to worry because at the minute I'm alright,\" he explained.",
      "A study by Glasgow University in 2019 found former professional footballers were almost three-and-a-half times more likely to be diagnosed with dementia than the general population.",
      "Windass said he wanted to raise awareness of dementia and get players' union the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) to increase its support to affected players and their families.",
      "\"The one thing I love about myself is trying to help as many people as I can in any way, shape or form,\" he said.",
      "\"The reason why we've done this [interview] is to help the families, because my family might need help in 10 or 15 years' time. So I don't want them to suffer as well.",
      "\"At this present time, if I can help or we can help people and push the PFA to help these people ... that's what we're trying to do and trying to achieve.\"",

    "story": [
      "Patients prescribed drugs for movement disorders - including restless leg syndrome (RLS) - say doctors did not warn them about serious side effects that led them to seek out risky sexual behaviour.",
      "Twenty women have told the BBC that the drugs - given to them for RLS, which causes an irresistible urge to move - ruined their lives.",
      "A report by drugs firm GSK - seen by the BBC - shows it learned in 2003 of a link between the medicines, known as dopamine agonist drugs, and what it described as \"deviant\" sexual behaviour. It cited a case of a man who had sexually assaulted a child while taking the drug for Parkinson's.",
      "While there is no explicit reference to this side effect in patient leaflets, the UK medicines regulator told us there was a general warning about increased libido and harmful behaviour. GSK says a risk of \"altered\" sexual interest is also referred to in the leaflets.",
      "Some of the women who described being drawn to risky sexual behaviour told us they had no idea of what was causing it. Others said they felt compelled to gamble or shop with no history of such activities. One accumulated debts of more than \u00a3150,000.",
      "Like many women, Claire first developed RLS during her pregnancies. The relentless need to move was often accompanied by sleeplessness and a crawling sensation under her skin.",
      "The condition persisted after giving birth and she was prescribed the dopamine agonist drug Ropinirole. She says she was not warned by doctors of any side effects. It initially worked wonders for her RLS, she says, but after a year or so she began feeling unprecedented sexual urges.",
      "\"The only way I could describe it is it was just deviant,\" she tells us - using that word without any knowledge of the GSK research which had established a link with such behaviour.",
      "Claire says she began leaving her house in the early hours of the morning to cruise for sex. Wearing a see-through top and jacket, she would flash her chest at any man she could find. She did this regularly, she says, and in increasingly dangerous locations, despite having a partner.",
      "\"There remains an element in your head that knows what you're doing is wrong, but it affects you to the point that you don't know you're doing it.\"",
      "Claire says it took years to connect these urges with her medication - and they disappeared almost immediately when she stopped taking it. She feels complete \"shame\" and is \"mortified\" at the danger she placed herself in.",
      "Listen to 5 Minutes On: The prescription drugs that gave me a gambling addiction",
      "Listen to 5 Minutes On: The prescription drugs that gave me a gambling addiction",
      "Impulsive behaviours, including gambling and increased sex drive, have long been listed as side effects in medicine leaflets for dopamine agonist drugs - and are thought to affect between 6% to 17% of RLS patients taking them, according to health guidance body NICE. A \"common\" side effect of any medicine can be considered to only affect as few as 1% of people who take it, according to the NHS.",
      "The drugs work by mimicking the behaviour of dopamine, a natural chemical in our brains which helps regulate movement. It is known as the \"happy hormone\" because it is activated when something is pleasurable or we feel rewarded.",
      "But agonist drugs can over-stimulate these feelings and under-stimulate the appreciation of consequences - leading to impulsive behaviour, according to academics.",
      "The cases of what the GSK report from 2003 described as \"deviant behaviour\"  involved two men who were prescribed Ropinirole for Parkinson's disease. In one, a 63-year-old-man sexually assaulted a seven-year-old girl, leading to a custodial sentence.",
      "The documents said the perpetrator's libido had increased significantly from the start of his treatment with Ropinirole and his \"libido problem subsequently resolved\" after his dose was reduced.",
      "In the second case, a 45-year-old man carried out \"uncontrolled acts of exhibitionism and indecent behaviour\". His sex drive was reported to have increased prior to being prescribed Ropinirole but his urges \"intensified\" after the treatment.",
      "Prevalence rates of what GSK calls \"deviant\" sexual behaviours caused by the drugs are unknown and tend to be under-reported by those who experience them, according to Valerie Voon, a professor of neuropsychiatry at the University of Cambridge.",
      "\"There's a lot of stigma and shame attached to it, and people don't realise that it's associated with a medication,\" she says.",
      "Prof Voon believes risky sexual behaviours - beyond a purely increased libido - should be specifically warned about and screened by the NHS, because their impact can be \"devastating\".",
      "RLS is believed to affect about one in 20 adults - and women are about twice as likely to suffer as men.",
      "The 20 sufferers we spoke to say not only had doctors failed to tell them of the potentially serious side effects of the drugs, but also failed to review the impact of the medication on their bodies subsequently.",
      "Sarah was in her 50s when she was prescribed another dopamine agonist drug made by a different manufacturer.",
      "\"Previously I'd have had no interest if Brad Pitt walked in the room naked,\" she says. \"But it turned me into this raging woman who kept taking sexual addiction further.\"",
      "Sarah began selling used underwear and videos of sex acts online - and organising telephone sex with strangers. She also began shopping compulsively - ending up with \u00a330,000 of debt.",
      "To combat the effects of the dopamine agonist, she began self-medicating by taking pain-relieving opioids and sleeping pills. She ended up being admitted to rehab - but that meant her driving licence was taken away and she lost her job.",
      "\"I turned to things that weren't healthy - I knew that the behaviour wasn't me, but I couldn't control it,\" she tells the BBC.",

She even mentioned recent gambling behaviour when the second drug was prescribed, she says. She went on to rack up debts of \u00a380,000.",
      "\"The effect on my family was horrific - it was life-changing money to lose,\" she says. \"But at the time I didn't know it was no fault of my own.\"",
      "A class action was brought against GSK in 2011 by four sufferers of Parkinson's disease - the BBC has learned. They said Ropinirole led to gambling debts and broken relationships.",
      "They also complained that despite a link between such behaviours and the drug having been established in medical studies as early as 2000, GSK had failed to include any warnings in its product literature until March 2007. The class action was settled but GSK denied liability.",
      "Cases of serious side effects have also been reported in other countries, particularly in relation to the use of drugs for Parkinson's disease.",
      "In France, a court awarded damages to a father of two who complained that Ropinirole had given him compulsive homosexual urges, while another man without a criminal record began torturing cats.",
      "In the US, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends the drugs should only be used for short-term treatment, such as end-of-life care.",
      "Many of the women the BBC spoke to also complained that prolonged use of the drugs also worsened their underlying RLS. It meant their dosage had been increased which, in turn, had exacerbated their compulsive behaviour - a process known as augmentation.",
      "Dr Guy Leschziner, a consultant neurologist, says the drugs still play an important role but he believes that drug companies, health authorities and doctors need to better warn patients of these side effects.",

      "\"As with all medicines, [it] has potential side effects and these are clearly stated in the prescribing information,\" it said.",

      "On 16 March 2020, the government launched the 'Ventilator Challenge' - a drive to encourage domestic UK suppliers to develop new machines or modify existing designs.",
      "The project was overseen by cabinet office officials and involved the MHRA, which helped draw up initial specifications and squeezed an approval process that would usually take 18-24 months into just weeks.",
      "A number of major companies were involved, including the carmakers Ford and McLaren, and the electronics giant Dyson.",
      "At the time, the company's founder Sir James Dyson held a number of telephone conversations with government officials, including the then Prime Minister Boris Johnson.",
      "The Covid inquiry was shown WhatsApp messages then sent between ministers and government advisers suggesting Sir James was concerned about the pace of project.",

      "Minutes later ex health secretary Matt Hancock replied, \"I have also received the same. I will talk to Dyson and Michael [Gove] and sort it.\"",
      "Asked about the deal at the inquiry, the government's then chief commercial officer, Sir Gareth Rhys Williams, said it was the only example he could recall in the pandemic where he was asked to put a contract in place \"against commercial guidance\".",

      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the changes would \"liberate\" frontline workers from excessive and \"competing directions\".",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM programme, he said the result would be \"better value for taxpayers and better outcomes for patients because the hundreds of millions of pounds we can save will be redeployed to the front line delivering better care\".",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch welcomed the move to bring the management of the health service back under ministerial control, but warned Labour \"cannot hide if things go wrong\".",

      "By weaker, he means a growing inability to make stuff happen and a big reason for that, he reckons, is the proliferation of arm's length bodies \u2013 taxpayer funded organisations with independence from the government and considerable power.",
      "There has been a growing sense in Downing Street as the prime minister and his team have adjusted to life in government that organisations dreamt up as a wheeze by previous governments so they don't get blamed for this or that all too often now stand in the way of a minister being able to do what they want.",
      "The recent row about the Sentencing Council in England and Wales is seen as a case in point.",
      "And now, scrapping NHS England is, ministers will argue, the ultimate case study in scrapping unaccountable bureaucracy.",
      "Scale of challenge",
      "So what did Liz Truss argue after her time in government?",
      "She talked of the \"tyranny of the technocracy\", the \"power of the administrative state\" and argued that \"there is something rather undemocratic about this\".",
      "She said that \"Blair and Brown had imposed a web of legalistic architecture that added process and put more power in the hands of technocrats\", which granted is a point where you might think Truss and Starmer would depart and no doubt do in many instances.",
      "But strikingly, given that recent row about the Sentencing Council, when was it set up?",
      "In April 2010, when Gordon Brown was prime minister.",
      "\"For any challenge faced, for too long the answer has been more arm's length bodies, quangos and regulators which end up blocking the government,\" Sir Keir writes in the Daily Telegraph, without reference to any particular such body.",
      "It is also true that this new-ish government has itself created new arms-length bodies, such as GB Energy and Skills England.",
      "Perhaps it is human nature - that your own arm's length bodies don't feel as pernicious as ones dreamt up by a predecessor.",
      "Beyond the comparisons, the reason all this matters is the government is up against a pervasive sense that nothing works any more.",
      "Think the 8am scramble for an appointment with the doctor and the waiting lists for an operation for a start.",
      "Some senior Labour figures fret privately that their talk of \"missions\" and a \"Plan for Change\" might seem puny to many in comparison with the scale of that challenge.",
      "The prime minister said: \"Every pound that we spend, every regulation, every decision must deliver for working people. And I don't just mean efficiency...I mean something else which is allowing the state, the government, to operate what I call maximum power.\"",
      "The prime minister's speech is both a symptom of his early frustration at the capacity of government to get stuff done - and an acknowledgement of the urgency to do just that.",

    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer has pledged to slash the costs of regulation with an \"active government\".",
      "In a speech, he said politicians had chosen to hide behind quangos and he took aim at a \"cottage industry of checkers and blockers slowing down delivery for working people\".",
      "But the key announcement was the abolition of the \"world's largest quango\", NHS England, which works with the government to agree funding and priorities, and oversees the delivery of services.",
      "He announced the government was bringing it back under the control of the Department of Health.",
      "Incoming governments have often sought to cut the number of quangos - but what are they and what do they do?",
      "What is a quango?",
      "Quango stands for Quasi-Autonomous Non-Governmental Organisation, but the government calls them \"arm's length bodies\". They are organisations such as regulators, cultural institutions and advisory bodies, which are funded by taxpayers but not directly controlled from Whitehall.",
      "They range from huge organisations like NHS England, to smaller ones like the Gambling Commission and the British Film Institute.",
      "How many quangos are there?",
      "The number of quangos has fallen by more than half since 2010 but there are still more than 300 across the UK.",
      "Under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, nearly 300 were axed - dubbed the \"bonfire of the quangos\" - in an attempt to improve accountability and cut costs.",
      "Despite Sir Keir indicating he would also like to reduce the role of quangos, the new Labour government has set up more than 20 since winning power.",
      "These include Great British Energy, which will invest in renewable energy to help meet the government's clean power goals, and Skills England, which aims to support people in finding jobs.",
      "Asked earlier this week if the government was planning another \"bonfire of the quangos\", Downing Street said the PM wanted to see a more \"active and agile state\", rather than \"outsourcing\" decisions to other bodies.",
      "How much do they cost?",
      "Almost 60% of day-to-day government spending is channelled through quangos, with 90% of this going to the largest 10 bodies.",
      "The total budget for quangos in 2022/23 - the latest published figures - was \u00a3353.3bn.",
      "Why are they controversial?",
      "Campaign groups like the TaxPayers' Alliance have long criticised quangos, claiming they allow ministers to dodge responsibility for mistakes and can be inefficient and costly.",
      "The Institute for Government think tank says in some cases scrapping public bodies can save money and improve how services are delivered.",
      "It gives the example of how absorbing JobCentre Plus into the Department for Work and Pensions helped cut the department's workforce and office space by a third.",
      "But the think tank argues abolitions also cost money and time in the short term, with services disrupted when powers are transferred.",

      "There are those on the Left of the party who don't believe any cuts should be made.",
      "At Prime Minister's Questions Richard Burgon \u2013 a frontbencher under Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 urged Sir Keir Starmer to consider a wealth tax rather than a welfare cut.",
      "Unsustainable welfare",

      "And Labour strategists believe that appearing to get a handle on welfare is an essential weapon in the anti-Reform UK armoury.",
      "The strongest argument the government can muster in favour of reform is that too many people who are regarded as long-term sick are in effect thrown on the unemployment scrapheap when, with the right help, they could engage in the world of work.",
      "And it's understood that the Treasury won't swallow up all of the welfare savings.",
      "Kendall will be able to redirect a significant sum \u2013 perhaps as much as \u00a31bn \u2013 into the kind of intensive support which some claimants would need to get off benefits.",
      "This, of course, would be expected to lead to savings in due course but won't bring instant rewards.",
      "Starmer urged to protect disability benefit claimants",
      "Starmer says benefit system unfair and indefensible",
      "How big is the welfare budget and where might cuts fall?",
      "Another argument being made is that the system currently provides a perverse incentive which encourages sickness over work.",
      "If you were to be assessed as having a limited capacity to work or undertake work-related activity you could be paid around \u00a3400 more a month than someone who is unemployed actively looking for work.",
      "That gap is likely to be narrowed.",
      "Where the government has a bigger challenge is to convince its own MPs that the level of Personal Independence Payments (PIP) - which are not means tested and are made to people who have a long-term physical or mental health condition - ought to change, and future eligibility restricted.",
      "At PMQs Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey asked Sir Keir to \"calm anxieties\" by giving an assurance that disability benefits for those who can't work wouldn't be cut.",
      "He didn't receive it.",
      "Here, the politics are tricky.",
      "PIP cuts don't fit in to the narrative of providing opportunities to people who are languishing on the dole.",
      "Some of those who receive PIP payments are in work and would argue that these provide essential support which enables them to remain in employment.",
      "The Department for Work and Pensions has consulted with charities, but even before the Green Paper has seen the light of day some of those organisations have been firing off denunciatory press releases.",
      "The state of the public finances means the Treasury needs to rein in spending if the chancellor is to meet her own fiscal rules, including having debt fall as a share of national income on a five-year horizon.",
      "The expectation is that PIP payments will be frozen next year \u2013 so their value will erode - and that some of those in receipt of PIP are likely to face re-assessment and may lose their payments entirely.",
      "Loyalty tested to the limit?",
      "It's here in particular that some the usually loyal MPs - not associated with the party's Left -  are expressing concerns.",
      "We have spoken to some of them who listened to the PM make the case for welfare reform at a private meeting on Monday, or who attended the private meetings on Wednesday.",
      "An attendee said there was too little detail to reach a definitive view but cutting disabled benefits was likely to be a red line. Others were more outspoken.",
      "One told us: \"People won't wear it. The costs of being disabled aren't going down.",
      "\"They cant just force this through like the winter fuel cut.\"",
      "Another said: \"If we're freezing PIP that is unforgivable.",
      "\"Some people have very complex disabilities. Part of the social contract is they are supported.\"",
      "And a usual supporter of Sir Keir said: \"Most of us broadly agree that there are lots of people who don't work but should, and have no problem with getting them into work.",
      "\"But punishing those who are especially vulnerable and have severe disabilities is unacceptable.\"",
      "Another added: \"The government needs to stop talking about everyone who is on disability benefits as if they are all the same because they are not.\"",

      "\"This is still a live conversation,\" one MP said.",
      "Some MPs also felt that the timing of the welfare cuts was wrong.",
      "For example, they said NHS waiting lists needed to come down first \u2013 which should also bring savings in PIP and incapacity benefits - and should be done against the backdrop of a growing, not stagnant, economy.",
      "It is worth remembering, though, that the government has a large majority and the prime minister himself is hugely determined not to duck difficult decisions on welfare.",
      "And that recently-formed Get Britain Working Group of Labour MPs \u2013 most of who are from the 2024 intake -  will vocally support the need for radical welfare reform.",
      "However one of the 36 signatories to the group's supportive letter to Kendall has withdrawn her name.",
      "Stoke South MP Allison Gardner said on social media that her name should not have been included, because the letter didn't do enough to  reflect the needs of those with severe disabilities who simply can't work.",

    "story": [
      "Farmers may turn their backs on environmental work for more intensive food production after the government suddenly closed a green funding scheme, the National Farmers' Union (NFU) has warned.",
      "The Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI), which pays farmers in England to manage land to protect soil, restore hedgerows and boost nature recovery, was a key part of the post-Brexit payment scheme that replaced EU subsidies.",
      "The government said SFI had been a success, with 37,000 funding agreements agreed, but it would not accept any new applications. No replacement has been announced.",
      "Tom Bradshaw, NFU president, said that it was \"another shattering blow to English farms\".",
      "Mr Bradshaw said the sudden closure would force farmers to decide \"whether to turn their backs on environmental work and just farm as hard as they can to survive\".",
      "Organic arable farmer Anna Biesty, who has a 300-hectare farm on the north Norfolk coast, said she was planning to apply for SFI funding and its closure means she now faces a \u00a3140,000 shortfall in her future income.",
      "She told BBC News she is now \"angry, frustrated and apprehensive about the future\".",
      "\"You spend time making plans based on the best information you have but then that plan I made is now pointless. It's a waste of time and that must be multiplied all around the country, whether it's farmers or nature charities who are managing land and using similar schemes.",
      "\"It just feels like we are being punched at from every angle possible,\" she explained.",
      "The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) announced the closure of SFI, which was launched in 2022, with little warning.",
      "It said that in total, more than 50,000 farm businesses - covering half of all farmed land - were now benefiting from wider environmental land management schemes (Elms).",
      "The 37,000 agreements signed for SFI funding had meant all the scheme's budget had been allocated and no more new applications could be accepted.",
      "In total, under the SFI scheme, \u00a31.05bn has been paid out or is contractually committed to farmers in current agreements or applications for funding since 2024.",
      "SFI is the largest part of Elms, which is the system of farm payments set up to replace EU subsidies with the idea that \"public goods\", like restoring and creating wildlife habitats, would be delivered by farmers in return for public money.",
      "The government said it was still committed to paying \u00a35bn over two years for such sustainable farming and nature recovery work.",
      "'Biggest budget'",
      "It added that a \"new and improved\" SFI, which will have a capped budget, will be set up but its details will not be announced until later in the year.",
      "Daniel Zeichner, minister for food security and rural affairs, said: \"This government is proud to have set the biggest budget for sustainable food produce in history.",
      "\"More farmers are now in schemes and more money is being spent through them than ever before. That is true today and will remain true tomorrow.\"",
      "But Mr Bradshaw said the closure of the current SFI scheme had \"slammed shut\" the door for funding for thousands of farmers.",
      "He said the closure was \"delivered yet again with no warning, no understanding of the industry and a complete lack of compassion or care\".",
      "Victoria Vyvyan, the president of the Country Land and Business Association (CLA), which represents thousands of rural landowners, said that closing the scheme was the \"most cruel\" betrayal.",
      "She added that the decision \"actively harms nature. It actively harms the environment. And, with war once again raging in Europe, to actively harm our food production is reckless beyond belief\".",
      "Martin Lines, chief executive of the Nature Friendly Farming Network (NFFN), said the gap before a new SFI scheme is in place would leave some farmers \"in a really difficult financial position\".",
      "\"This has left many farmers feeling frustrated and let down, with no clear opportunity to be rewarded for delivering public goods in the near future,\" he said.",

      "Councils are to be given greater powers to seize land, under government plans to boost housebuilding.",
      "The measure is part of the flagship Planning and Infrastructure Bill, which has been introduced in Parliament and aims to speed up building.",
      "Housing Minister Matthew Pennycook said he wanted greater use of compulsory purchase orders (CPOs), which allow public authorities to acquire land without the consent of the owner.",
      "Currently, councils buying sites through CPOs must factor in the \"hope value\" - the potential value if planning permission for development is secured  - and this is set to be axed to allow land to be bought at a lower price.",
      "However, rural campaign groups raised concerns farmers could be forced to sell at knock-down prices and that green spaces could be lost.",
      "Victoria Vyvan, president of the Country Land and Business Association said the \"expensive, slow and bureaucratic planning system\" was what was preventing land sales by her members, who \"strongly believe that a small number of homes should be built in a large number of villages\".",
      "She added: \"In removing hope value from compulsory purchases, the government wants farmers to pay for a housing crisis they didn't create.",
      "\"We doubt house builders contracted by councils will be taking a lower profit, so once again farmers will be the only part of the supply chain to lose out.\"",
      "Paul Miner, head of planning and policy at CPRE, the countryside charity, said the group supported the use of CPOs to build genuinely affordable homes on previously developed land.",

      "New homes fall again in government's first six months",
      "Where does the government want 1.5 million new homes?",
      "Labour would build on green belt to boost housing",
      "Responding to such fears, Pennycook told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was \"somewhat mystified\" by this interpretation, saying CPOs would be used \"far more often\" for regenerating brownfield - or previously developed - land.",
      "\"We think it's right these powers are more widely used and it will be for local authorities to make the decisions about what land is appropriate for those powers to be used on,\" he added.",
      "A requirement for the secretary of state to sign off on CPOs will be removed \"in certain instances\", he said, adding that the legislation would be \"transformative\" in unlocking construction for new homes, roads, rail and renewable energy projects.",
      "The bill also aims streamline the planning process, with more decisions made directly by officers rather than councillors.",
      "However, councils have raised concerns this could mean they will be shut out of the democratic planning process.",
      "Richard Clewer, housing and planning spokesperson at the Country Councils Network, said he welcomed changes to CPOs as a \"useful tool\".",
      "However, he said changes to the planning process could \"dilute and bypass the role of councillors\", particularly with rural developments where a few new homes could make a significant impact.",
      "Defending the plans, Pennycook said \"expert planning officers\" would support elected councillors with technical detail and allow councillors to focus on larger, more controversial applications.",
      "The government has promised to build 1.5 million new homes in England over the next five years, with the pledge key to boosting economic growth.",
      "However, the number of new homes continued to fall during the first six months that Labour was in power, with the construction industry warning the country does not have enough workers to deliver on the target.",
      "Pennycook said the inheritance from the previous Conservative government was \"dire\" but there were \"very positive signs\" and \"green shoots coming forward\" in the number of planning applications being submitted.",

      "Some - such as the Environment Agency, or the broadcasting regulator Ofcom - have powers to make decisions without ministerial input.",

      "\"The state has become larger, but it hasn't become more effective,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The spokesperson said regulators had \"not been focused enough on growth\" and that would be a theme of the prime minister's speech on Thursday.",
      "Hours after the cabinet meeting, the government announced it was scraping the Payment Systems Regulator, which oversees financial transactions such as those through cash machines or contactless payments.",

      "The Scottish government is to scrap flagship plans to make homeowners switch to greener heating soon after buying a new home.",
      "The acting net-zero secretary Gillian Martin told MSPs that the draft Heat in Buildings Bill would no longer be put forward in its current form.",
      "She said the legislation - drafted by the Scottish Greens as part of the Bute House Agreement - would \"make people poorer.\"",
      "But Scottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie, who drafted the bill, said the decision \"flies in the face of the climate ambitions that this government is supposed to have\".",
      "Ms Martin said she would introduce a bill only when she could be satisfied it would both decarbonise houses and decrease fuel poverty.",
      "Climate change legislation passed by MSPs",
      "Heat pumps needed at 'much faster rate' - watchdog",
      "What is a heat pump and how much do they cost?",
      "Heating homes, largely through gas boilers, is responsible for about 18.5% of Scotland's planet warming greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "The legislation would have required them to be replaced with alternatives, such as electric heat pumps, within a set time frame after the sale of a property.",
      "But Martin said: \"I'm going to introduce a Heat in Buildings Bill when I can be satisfied that those interventions within it will decrease fuel poverty at the same time as decarbonising houses.\"",
      "The minister said she felt the drafting of the bill didn't take that \"significantly into consideration\" and added there were \"so many moving parts\".",
      "Martin said: \"I am going to craft a bill that is going to simultaneously reduce carbon and tackle fuel poverty.",
      "\"And until I can do that I'm afraid there will not be a bill put forward in its current drafted form because at the moment it will make people poorer.\"",
      "'Condemning the poorest'",
      "Scottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie, who drafted the bill, said the decision \"flies in the face of the climate ambitions that this government is supposed to have\".",
      "He added: \"This is yet another example of the SNP's climate delays, which have grown more and more worrying over the last year.",
      "\"It will also delay the huge benefit households need to see from ending their reliance on fossil fuels and their volatile prices.\"",
      "WWF Scotland also criticised the move and questioned the logic behind it.",
      "Io Hadjicosta, the charity's climate and energy policy manager, said: \"This announcement is deeply concerning and is yet another case of the Scottish government flip flopping when it comes to tackling the climate emergency.",
      "\"Reducing emissions from Scotland's housing stock by improving insulation and fitting renewable heat pumps would lift people out of fuel poverty - not increase it.",
      "\"By delaying the introduction of the Heat in Buildings Bill further all the government is doing is condemning the poorest in our society to increasingly high fossil fuel costs and damp, unhealthy homes.\"",
      "Douglas Lumsden, the Scottish Conservatives' spokesperson on net zero and energy, said the plans were \"completely unrealistic\".",
      "He said: \"We repeatedly warned nationalist ministers that they would hammer hard-pressed Scots with huge costs but until now they have ploughed ahead regardless.",
      "\"Gillian Martin must now go back to the drawing board and work up proposals that are fair to taxpayers and guarantee their concerns will be listened to.\"",
      "Last April the Scottish government confirmed it would scrap its annual and interim targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "It said they would be replaced with a system measuring emissions every five years.",
      "In a statement to the Scottish parliament, Energy Secretary Mairi McAllan accepted that the target of cutting emissions by 75% by 2030 was out of reach.",
      "But she told MSPs the government must act to chart a course reach net zero by 2045 at a pace and scale which was feasible, fair and just.",
      "The Heat in Buildings Bill was once described to me as \"game changing\" legislation designed to reduce the massive carbon footprint that comes from heating our homes.",
      "Our gas boilers are the main culprit; lots of individual devices inefficiently burning fossil fuels to create the heat.",
      "At least a million of them needed to be replaced by 2030 to meet the Scottish government's now abandoned interim climate change targets.",
      "The legislation would have meant anyone buying a home would have had to change to a green heating system \u2013 like a heat pump \u2013 within, say, two years of the sale being completed. The exact time frame had not been decided.",
      "But with the 2030 target now scrapped, and a much delayed energy strategy still not forthcoming, the pressure is off.",
      "Although the plan could be revived in the future it is pretty clear, from the tone of the ministerial statement, that something major would have to change for that to happen."

      "The cost of reducing energy bills for people who live near pylons will be paid for by increasing average annual bills across the country by 80p, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has told the BBC.",
      "Under the government's plans, households in Great Britain within 500m of new or upgraded pylons will get discounts of up to \u00a32,500 over 10 years, equivalent to \u00a3250 a year.",
      "Miliband said the costs of the scheme were \"more than offset\" by the benefits of the new infrastructure.",
      "He added that the idea was not about buying people off but \"recognising the service\" they were doing for the whole country.",
      "However, rural campaign groups said it was \"impossible to put a price on the loss of a landscape\".",
      "A government-commissioned report found hundreds of miles of new pylons will be needed to meet its clean energy targets.",
      "But new infrastructure proposals have sparked fierce opposition from residents in parts of the country like Norfolk and Suffolk, with campaigners arguing they will destroy the countryside.",
      "The bill discounts, which will be funded by electricity suppliers, are expected to be in place from 2026.",
      "Suppliers are expected to recoup costs by passing them on to other customers.",
      "Miliband told the BBC: \"At the moment, we're having to switch off offshore wind farms because we haven't got the transmission infrastructure.",
      "\"So everybody benefits from this. Everybody gets lower bills, and those who live near pylons are given a recognition of what they're doing.\"",

      "The government said this would mean communities could get \u00a3200,000 worth of funding per km of overhead electricity cable in their area, and \u00a3530,000 per substation.",
      "Initial analysis estimates both bill discounts and community funds could see a total additional cost of between \u00a31-2 a year for the average customer over 10 years.",
      "The government is also looking at how communities near onshore wind farms and other energy infrastructure can receive benefits.",
      "The plans were welcomed by RenewableUK, which represents the sector.",
      "The group's head of policy, James Robottom, said bill discounts would \"help to enable the roll-out of much-needed new grid infrastructure at a faster pace, so that we can make the most of the vast amounts of clean power we're producing\".",
      "However, Jackie Copley, campaign lead at CPRE, the countryside charity, said: \"Investing in local green spaces or improving community infrastructure would be a better way to spend this money.",
      "\"Paying individuals comes with many problems, including questions of fairness, likely legal challenges, and the fact that it's impossible to put a price on the loss of a landscape.\"",
      "The idea of giving people living near new pylons money off their energy bills was also proposed under the previous Conservative government.",
      "A government survey in 2024 suggested 78% of people would find an energy infrastructure project more acceptable if they were offered discounts on their bills.",
      "Some energy companies already offer bill discounts to customers who live near infrastructure like wind turbines, while grants are also available for local communities affected.",
      "The bill also includes measures that would allow \"ready-to-go\" energy projects to jump to the front of the queue for grid connections, replacing the current \"first come, first served\" process.",
      "The government says the existing system is being \"clogged up\" by speculative projects creating 10 year waits for \"viable infrastructure\".",

      "Officials will consult on removing Sport England, the Theatres Trust and the Garden History Society from the list of \"statutory consultees\", who are legally required to provide advice on decisions.",
      "The government said in some cases organisations were slowing down building, giving the example of a housing development in Bradford which was delayed because the application was thought to have not adequately considered the speed of cricket balls from a nearby club.",

      "Emails show a senior official at the health watchdog warned that the former cabinet office minister was trying to \"circumvent the regulatory process\" in March 2020.",
      "Messages between staff at the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said Mr Gove did not \"appreciate the level of risk involved\" and was working to a \"totally unrealistic\" timescale.",

      "Ventilator Challenge",
      "In March 2020, as Covid was spreading across northern Italy, there was a frantic attempt by health authorities to get hold of ventilators to help patients breathe.",
      "The NHS had between 6,000 and 8,000 in stock but modelling suggested it needed 30,000 by the end of June and 90,000 by November to cope with a predicted influx of patients.",
      "On 16 March 2020, the government launched the 'Ventilator Challenge' - a drive to encourage domestic UK suppliers to develop new machines or modify existing designs.",
      "The project was overseen by cabinet office officials and involved the MHRA, which helped draw up initial specifications and squeezed an approval process that would usually take 18-24 months into just weeks.",
      "A number of major companies were involved, including the carmakers Ford and McLaren, and the electronics giant Dyson.",

      "\"Just imagine the situation, if you will, a minister \u2013 Matt Hancock, I, Boris Johnson \u2013 says we want to have a potentially lethal machine in hospitals deliberately so that we can meet an arbitrary deadline. It's inconceivable,\" he said.",

      "And the EU is targeting US goods including Bourbon whiskey, jeans and Harley-Davidson motorcycles, which are considered to be politically sensitive in America because of their iconic status and because of which US states some of them are  produced in.",
      "Notwithstanding the hope for a free trade deal, in the wake of any reciprocal tariffs imposed by the US, which are perceived to be unfair and punitive, the UK government could find itself under growing pressure to retaliate in a similar way to the EU.",
      "Why is Trump imposing tariffs?",
      "The US President has a long - and often shifting - list of justifications for imposing these import taxes.",
      "One is that he claims to want to restore fairness to America's trading relations with the rest of the world.",
      "Trump complains that some other countries have higher tariffs on the goods they import from the US, than the other way round.",
      "The US had an average external tariff of 3.3% in 2023.",
      "That was slightly lower than the UK's average tariff of 3.8%.",
      "It was also below the European Union's average tariff of 5% and China's average tariff of 7.5%.",
      "However, America's average tariff was considerably lower than those of some of its other trading partners such as India (17%) and South Korea (13.4%).",
      "Broadly speaking, it is legitimate for Trump to point out that some countries have a higher average tariff on imports than America does.",
      "Replacing income tax?",
      "Another justification for tariffs from the president is raising more tax revenue for the US government. At one stage during the presidential election campaign in 2024, he suggested that tariff revenue could entirely replace the federal income tax.",
      "This is not only implausible given the $3 trillion a year value of US imports and the $2 trillion a year raised by income tax - but it needs to be seen in the context of the fact that tariffs would push up US consumer prices.",
      "Trump also wants to put pressure on other countries to change some of their policies. This has been the explicit rationale for US tariffs on Canada and Mexico, with the White House saying it wants to pressure those countries to stamp out cross-border Fentanyl smuggling.",
      "Another key goal articulated by the president is wanting to encourage multinational manufacturing companies to invest and produce more in America to create domestic jobs.",
      "Some of these justifications are inconsistent.",
      "Tariffs cannot be a both a major permanent tax revenue raiser as well as a way to bring manufacturing back to America on a large scale as the latter implies imports - and therefore tariff revenues - slumping.",
      "Moreover, the vast majority of economists are also extremely sceptical about the likelihood of tariffs achieving many of these goals.",

      "She was a player in UK politics in a way that neither of her successors could expect to be.",
      "That was partly drawn from her mandate - an extraordinary run of election wins that made her leader of the third placed party at Westminster.",
      "That gave her a voice in debates about Brexit and offered the UK media a political contrast with a succession of Conservative prime ministers, including Boris Johnson.",
      "She was also seen as a persistent threat to the continuation of the UK state, pushing the boundaries of devolution in pursuit of her ambition to hold another independence referendum.",
      "In the end, neither the forces of her personality or argument were able to bring that about.",
      "Her strategy collapsed when the UK Supreme Court ruled that any future vote must be agreed with the UK government.",
      "Subsequent talk of using a UK general election as a substitute referendum lacked credibility.",
      "This was a significant factor in what brought her leadership to a close, as was her focus on the politics of switching gender identity - ironically the subject of an opposition debate at Holyrood today.",
      "There were also the divisions in the SNP and the wider independence movement caused by the spectacular fallout Sturgeon had with her predecessor, Alex Salmond, when the Scottish government mishandled harassment complaints against him.",

      "Rachel Reeves has previously ruled out further tax rises, but faces difficult choices because of the performance of the UK economy and world events.",
      "What is the Spring Statement and when is it?",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which monitors the government's spending plans and performance, will publish its forecast on the UK economy on Wednesday 26 March.",
      "It will also provide estimates on the cost of living for households and whether it thinks the government will stick to its self-imposed rules on borrowing and spending.",
      "Reeves will present the watchdog's main findings to Parliament, and alongside this will make her Spring Statement on the economy.",
      "After she has spoken, the opposition, likely to be either Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch or shadow chancellor Mel Stride, will respond.",
      "What is the chancellor expected to announce?",
      "Reeves has committed to one major economic event - the Budget - each year, to \"give families and businesses stability and certainty on tax and spending changes\".",
      "That means no big policy announcements are made on 26 March, but that's not stopping them being made beforehand.",
      "With the economy seen to be underperforming and global factors, such as US trade tariffs, indirectly impacting the UK, there is growing speculation over whether the chancellor will break her self-imposed rules on borrowing.",
      "The OBR's forecast is expected to confirm that the \u00a39.9bn financial buffer to meet her budget rule by the 2029/30 financial year, has been wiped out.",
      "Reeves has repeatedly said her rules are \"non-negotiable\". Her two main rules are:",
      "Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spendingTo get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament",
      "Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending",

      "Possible other announcements that are being reported include:",
      "Reducing the \u00a320,000 tax-free annual limit in cash ISAs, to encourage more people to invest their savings in stocks and shares Confirming details of how international aid funding will be reallocated to defence, following the prime minister's announcement that UK defence spending will rise to 2.5% of national income by 2027.",

      "Government sources have been keen to state that this event is not a major one because it will not include tax rises, only spending cuts.",
      "A debateable tax hiking policy could be announced, however, if Reeves decides to extend the freeze on the thresholds at which people start to pay different rates of income tax.",
      "The policy is known as a hidden tax rise or stealth tax, as it takes effect over time as people are dragged into paying more tax as their pay goes up, without the tax rate rising at all.",
      "Thresholds were frozen by the previous Conservative government until April 2028, but the chancellor could decide to extend the freeze beyond this to raise about \u00a37bn a year, according to consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics and investment bank Citi.",
      "Reeves decided not to extend the threshold freeze in her first Budget, arguing that doing so \"would hurt working people\" and \"take more money out of their payslips\".",
      "Whether any other spending cuts are announced in the Spring Statement or in the Spending Review in June, or even delayed until the next Budget, remains to be seen.",
      "How is the UK economy doing?",
      "Recent figures show UK economic growth has been sluggish - not shrinking, but not growing as desired.",
      "The economy grew by just 0.1% between October and December 2024, according to the latest official figures.",
      "When an economy grows, more businesses can employ extra workers or give pay rises. Firms making higher profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",
      "In addition to slow growth, prices are also rising faster than wanted.",
      "The current inflation rate of 3% is higher than the Bank of England's 2% target, and is forecast to go higher. Inflation could dictate whether interest rates are lowered further from their current 4.5%.",
      "Higher rates mean higher borrowing costs for loans, credit cards and mortgage deals, but it also provides better returns on savings.",
      "Costs for businesses are expected to jump further in April, when National Insurance contributions paid by employers rise. These could be passed on to consumers.",
      "Pressure has also increased on the chancellor's tax and spending plans after a surplus in government finances missed official forecasts, prompting speculation from economists that she could break her fiscal rules as things stand.",
      "Borrowing costs for the UK surged in January in part due to concerns over the UK's economic outlook, threatening Reeves's economic plans. The costs have since fallen back but remain higher than this time last year.",
      "Reeves has also warned that a potential global trade war, despite tariffs not directly targeting the UK, would lower growth and raise inflation."

    "summary": "The PM seizes the spotlight as Trump upends the world order - but he faces serious challenges in the UK.",
    "story": [
      "\"Trump may be the best thing to happen to Starmer,\" says a diplomat, suggesting the brash property tycoon busy upending the world order might be just what the strait-laced prime minister - who's been dragging in the polls - needs.",
      "One of Labour's business backers calls it \"the PM's finest hour\" - a Remainer leader putting Britain at the heart of international action as Trump rattles the Western world's cage.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer has certainly been incredibly visible \u2013 in the White House, leading a European summit at Lancaster House last weekend, hugging Zelensky, plotting a peacekeeping path with Macron.",
      "It's hard for the Conservatives and other opponents to compete with the prime minister's international moves dominating the news.",
      "Moments of crisis like the one we're living through are often when the public tunes into politics and looks to their leaders. With a shaky global situation, does No 10 look more solid than before?",
      "Some of his colleagues are certain. One government source tells me all the international activity is \"almost Blair-esque\", or even a moment like Thatcher and the Falklands which enabled the 80s Conservative prime minister to burnish her reputation and win successive election victories.",
      "Another minister suggests other leaders \"get their knickers in a twist\" publicly reacting to Trump's unpredictable comments and actions - \"but Keir has spent his whole career dealing with extreme circumstances. What he is able to do is get people to focus on the things that really matter.\"",
      "But impressive-looking diplomacy doesn't mean the UK is getting what it wants \u2013 missiles are still falling, overnight again in Donetsk and Kharkhiv. Donald Trump's commitment to guaranteeing Ukraine's security, even NATO's future, is shaky too.",
      "So let's take a calm look. Polling suggests there has been a nudge upwards for Sir Keir's personal ratings and for Labour, after a dreadful start in office and a steep, fast drop in the polls.",
      "His government would not be the first to be swept away by the intensity and glamour of global diplomacy which, however difficult or worthy, doesn't necessarily translate into significant brownie points at home.",
      "Perhaps in these wild times, we're seeing the prime minister carve out a role as \"reassurer in chief\". In political circles it's long been common to find criticisms of Sir Keir Starmer for, frankly, being a bit dull, and not willing to play the minute-by-minute political game. But with Trump in the White House stoking drama the PM's colleagues believe his steadiness has become an asset.",
      "And he's shown willingness to take action \u2013 increasing defence spending, albeit after months of pressure, getting European leaders together and drawing up military plans for after a peace deal. A senior government source says: \"The global crisis means people looking at us again, and the government has been making an argument that people are responding to: that we have got their backs.\"",
      "But aligning yourself with an American president doesn't always work out. Tony Blair's chinos weren't the only thing that became uncomfortable about his relationship with George W Bush.",
      "So while there's evidence the public are looking at Sir Keir a touch more favourably since his White House trip, as one union leader warns, \"for it to count he has to show the same mojo at home\".",
      "Take the row over sentencing this week. Or forthcoming arguments over cutting welfare, which ministers have been falling over themselves to soften the ground for.",
      "But overshadowing everything, priority number one: the grisly state of the economy and getting it to grow.",
      "In around a fortnight Rachel Reeves will be on her feet in Parliament, probably announcing cuts to public spending running to billions. Government sources point to some better statistics on wages, and cuts to interest rates, but Reeves is under enormous pressure to explain how the economy is going to escape the doldrums it has been stuck in for ages.",
      "All the Kodak moments, and grip and grins with international leaders in the world won't change that. The PM \"can walk and talk at the same\" time, one ally says. But there are, they acknowledge, \"only so many hours in the day\".",
      "Helping Ukraine against Putin's Russia has a clear moral story the prime minister finds easy to tell, and compelling to try to shape. In contrast, \"how do you bring prosperity to the regions? That's a real puzzle.\"",
      "In the next few days, starting with the PM's right-hand man Pat McFadden in the studio tomorrow, you will see the government try to kick up the pace of what is happening at home. First up - perhaps not a box-office hit - they'll be looking at making the Whitehall machine work better, including making it easier to get rid of civil servants.",
      "Ministers tell me Downing Street is being run more effectively than before Christmas and has a clearer sense of direction, after early embarrassment over being far less prepared than promised.",
      "Sir Keir chairs regular meetings with individual cabinet ministers in charge of the government's \"missions\". I'm told he \"cross-examines\" them and their officials - and if their answers aren't up to snuff, they get called in for another meeting. \"He is a very nice man, but he is a hard man too,\" one of them confides.",
      "As well as slimming down parts of the civil service, there'll be more on the government's plans to cut billions off the welfare bill. Labour will argue it's for good reason, to help people stuck on benefits - while critics will say it's a way for the government to save money off the backs of some of the most vulnerable people in the country.",
      "On Thursday, the prime minister is expected to make his own speech in an attempt to weave it all together into a grand narrative about safety abroad and at home. One government source said the last few weeks had galvanised Sir Keir's thinking on this: when things are uncertain on the international stage, \"everything feels a bit wobbly\" and domestic security is amplified: you look around and feel your job isn't secure, your street isn't safe.",
      "This thinking has been a long time coming. \"Security\" was a word and concept used by Reeves and Sir Keir in opposition - but recently he's been making a more ideological argument than those close to him are used to hearing.",
      "As well as making the case that what happens around the world is inextricably linked to what happens at home, he holds that the old international consensus among Western leaders has failed for millions of voters.",
      "That argument was crystallised into a long memo he sent to his cabinet ministers and political team in the middle of February. In it he wrote: \"The government's challenge was to shape this new era. Not to defend institutions that are broken or old ideas that have failed, but to be the voice of working people who more than anything want security in their lives, and a country that is on the up again.\"",
      "He wrote that politicians were wrong to think markets had solutions for almost everything. \"We were cowed by the market - we came to act as if it always knew best and the state should sit it out.\"",
      "He also said governments had failed on immigration, failed to understand the public's concerns and also - to tell the truth. \"We ended up treating all immigration as an untrammelled good. Somehow, politics ended up being too scared to say what is obvious - that some people are genuine refugees and some aren't; that people coming here to work can be a positive, but that an island nation needs to control its borders.\"",
      "Some extracts from the letter have been revealed before. But what is notable, reading the whole document, is the prime minister closes his letter to colleagues with a call to provide \"security\" for the country, alongside renewing public services. He writes: \"Now is our moment to be bigger and bolder - to put pedal on metal on wholescale reform and change our politics and our country. Security and renewal are our twin tasks - we must now deliver them.\"",
      "You'll hear more of that argument from ministers in the coming days - we had a glimpse of it in the studio last Sunday morning too.",
      "The profound uncertainty Donald Trump's arrival in the White House has given the prime minister a moment to step into the spotlight on the world stage.",
      "And his government is now much more overtly weaving an argument that working to establish security round the world is fundamentally connected to sorting out security at home.",
      "There is a reason why, fresh from all the diplomatic handshakes, Sir Keir was back in the more familiar hi-vis and hard hat announcing defence jobs in Belfast.",
      "No 10 wants you to see and believe that crisis abroad can mean opportunity at home. This spasm in global security has given a prime minister sometimes accused of being a blank page a clearer story to tell.",
      "But in the end, for any prime minister, it is what happens on home turf, not foreign adventures that matter the most. A sceptical public will take a lot of convincing to believe government can improve their situation \u2013 make it easier to manage the bills, buy a house, or for their kids to find a decent job.",
      "As as a senior figure in the Labour movement concludes, \"he likes the statesman role but the bottom line is, change in people's lives will be the decider.\"",

    "story": [
      "Early-rising UK stargazers are in for a celestial treat on Friday as a lunar eclipse takes place just before dawn.",
      "For most of the UK the eclipse will be partial as the Earth's shadow will not cover all of the Moon. For some far western regions, and across the Americas, the eclipse will be total, weather permitting",
      "As the Moon moves into Earth's shadow, it will gradually darken before turning a dusky red, resulting in a stunning \"blood moon\". A weather front will bring some cloud overnight but there is a good chance skies will be clear enough to see it.",
      "The last total lunar eclipse in the UK occurred in 2022.",
      "When is the lunar eclipse?",
      "The penumbral phase (when the Moon first enters Earth's outer shadow) will begin at 03:57 on Friday.",
      "The partial eclipse - when the Moon starts moving into the darker part of Earth's shadow - will begin at 05:09.",
      "Lunar eclipses are visible from anywhere on Earth where the Moon is above the horizon at the time.",
      "At 06:58 the eclipse will reach its true maximum; however, in almost all of the UK, the Moon will have already set below the horizon, so we won't be able to see this.",
      "Very western areas like the Scottish highlands, west Cornwall and the very western parts of Northern Ireland may get a brief glimpse of total eclipse.",
      "For those in North America, most of South America, and western Greenland, the eclipse will be total.",
      "\"Even if you have to get up super early to see it, I would definitely recommend that you try because seeing it in real life is really, really cool,\" says Imo Bell, astronomer at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich.",
      "What is a lunar eclipse and a blood moon?",
      "A lunar eclipse happens when Earth moves directly between the Sun and the Moon, blocking sunlight and casting a shadow on the Moon's surface.",
      "There are three main types:",
      "Total lunar eclipse \u2013 The entire Moon moves into Earth's shadow and turns red.",
      "Total lunar eclipse \u2013 The entire Moon moves into Earth's shadow and turns red.",
      "Partial lunar eclipse \u2013 Only part of the Moon enters Earth's shadow, creating a visible dark section.",
      "Partial lunar eclipse \u2013 Only part of the Moon enters Earth's shadow, creating a visible dark section.",

      "Penumbral lunar eclipse \u2013 A subtle event where the Moon passes through Earth's outer shadow, causing a slight dimming.",
      "People sometimes refer to a lunar eclipse as a \"blood moon\" because of the way the Moon can turn a deep, coppery red during the eclipse.",
      "This is caused by a process known as \"Rayleigh scattering\" which also makes the sky blue and our sunsets red. It scatters more of the shorter blue wavelength light, allowing the longer red wavelength light to remain visible.",
      "During a lunar eclipse, all of the light shining onto the Moon has come through Earth's atmosphere. It's as if every sunrise and sunset in the world is projected onto the lunar surface.",
      "How to see it?",
      "To get the best view of the eclipse, head to a clear, dark location.",
      "\"My top tip would be to make sure you have a good view of the western horizon, because the Moon will be in the west and it will be setting towards the western horizon,\" advises Imo Bell of the Royal Observatory.",
      "Another top tip from Imo: it'll be dark so bring a light to help get around, but use a red torch if you can get hold of one. It helps keep your eyes adjusted to the dark.",
      "Also, of course, check the weather forecast.",
      "\"Even though some people might say it's not that unusual to get a lunar eclipse, as we can see one every few years, next time it comes around, it might be cloudy. So, if you can, definitely do get out and try and have a look,\" said Imo.",
      "The next lunar eclipse visible in the UK will be on 7 September 2025.",
      "Will the skies be clear enough to see it?",
      "We've seen a change to colder more unsettled weather and northerly winds over recent days.",
      "A weather front will sink south overnight on Thursday into the early hours of Friday, bringing cloud, rain or hill snow to northern parts of the UK and obscuring the view of the sky for some.",
      "However, there is a chance of the skies being clear enough to view the partial eclipse early on Friday, especially in the north of Northern Ireland and Scotland as well as the south of England and Wales.",

    "story": [
      "Farmers may turn their backs on environmental work for more intensive food production after the government suddenly closed a green funding scheme, the National Farmers' Union (NFU) has warned.",
      "The Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI), which pays farmers in England to manage land to protect soil, restore hedgerows and boost nature recovery, was a key part of the post-Brexit payment scheme that replaced EU subsidies.",
      "The government said SFI had been a success, with 37,000 funding agreements agreed, but it would not accept any new applications. No replacement has been announced.",
      "Tom Bradshaw, NFU president, said that it was \"another shattering blow to English farms\".",
      "Mr Bradshaw said the sudden closure would force farmers to decide \"whether to turn their backs on environmental work and just farm as hard as they can to survive\".",
      "Organic arable farmer Anna Biesty, who has a 300-hectare farm on the north Norfolk coast, said she was planning to apply for SFI funding and its closure means she now faces a \u00a3140,000 shortfall in her future income.",
      "She told BBC News she is now \"angry, frustrated and apprehensive about the future\".",
      "\"You spend time making plans based on the best information you have but then that plan I made is now pointless. It's a waste of time and that must be multiplied all around the country, whether it's farmers or nature charities who are managing land and using similar schemes.",
      "\"It just feels like we are being punched at from every angle possible,\" she explained.",
      "The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) announced the closure of SFI, which was launched in 2022, with little warning.",
      "It said that in total, more than 50,000 farm businesses - covering half of all farmed land - were now benefiting from wider environmental land management schemes (Elms).",
      "The 37,000 agreements signed for SFI funding had meant all the scheme's budget had been allocated and no more new applications could be accepted.",
      "In total, under the SFI scheme, \u00a31.05bn has been paid out or is contractually committed to farmers in current agreements or applications for funding since 2024.",
      "SFI is the largest part of Elms, which is the system of farm payments set up to replace EU subsidies with the idea that \"public goods\", like restoring and creating wildlife habitats, would be delivered by farmers in return for public money.",
      "The government said it was still committed to paying \u00a35bn over two years for such sustainable farming and nature recovery work.",
      "'Biggest budget'",
      "It added that a \"new and improved\" SFI, which will have a capped budget, will be set up but its details will not be announced until later in the year.",
      "Daniel Zeichner, minister for food security and rural affairs, said: \"This government is proud to have set the biggest budget for sustainable food produce in history.",
      "\"More farmers are now in schemes and more money is being spent through them than ever before. That is true today and will remain true tomorrow.\"",
      "But Mr Bradshaw said the closure of the current SFI scheme had \"slammed shut\" the door for funding for thousands of farmers.",
      "He said the closure was \"delivered yet again with no warning, no understanding of the industry and a complete lack of compassion or care\".",
      "Victoria Vyvyan, the president of the Country Land and Business Association (CLA), which represents thousands of rural landowners, said that closing the scheme was the \"most cruel\" betrayal.",
      "She added that the decision \"actively harms nature. It actively harms the environment. And, with war once again raging in Europe, to actively harm our food production is reckless beyond belief\".",
      "Martin Lines, chief executive of the Nature Friendly Farming Network (NFFN), said the gap before a new SFI scheme is in place would leave some farmers \"in a really difficult financial position\".",

      "Prof Alastair Hay, emeritus professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds said: \"The priority, I imagine, for the crews trying to contain the damage, will be to extinguish the fires and keep vessels afloat. This will reduce the quantity of chemicals entering the water and the risk for wildlife downstream.\"",
      "The fire that broke out following the crash will have helped to burn off some of the jet fuel but testing kits are being set to the site to confirm there is no residue remaining.",
      "Frode Vikeb\u00f8, research manager at the Institute of Marine Research said that the UK government will be modelling the spread of any contaminants at sea, considering ocean circulation and weather conditions, as part of \"standard procedure\".",
      "In terms of mitigation, Dr Karen Purnell, former director of ITOPF - which advises governments on maritime pollution, said the first approach would be to let the jet fuel \"dissipate naturally where possible and avoiding deliberate containment.\"",
      "If any jet fuel did make it to shore, she said: \"Flushing the shoreline to remobilise the fuel and perhaps directing it into absorbent booms or mats for later disposal could be an option.\" But she said the approach would differ depending on the different types of environment, for example whether there were wetlands.",

    "story": [
      "Parents who are worried about their children being on Roblox should not let them use it, the chief executive of the gigantic gaming platform has said.",
      "The site, which is the most popular in the UK among young gamers aged eight to 12, has been dogged by claims of some children being exposed to explicit or harmful content through its games, alongside multiple reported allegations of bullying and grooming.",
      "But its co-founder and CEO Dave Baszucki insisted that the company is vigilant in protecting its users and pointed out that \"tens of millions\" of people have \"amazing experiences\" on the site.",
      "When asked what his message is to parents who don't want their children on the platform, Mr Baszucki said: \"My first message would be, if you're not comfortable, don't let your kids be on Roblox.\"",
      "\"That sounds a little counter-intuitive, but I would always trust parents to make their own decisions,\" he told BBC News in an exclusive interview.",
      "Responding to the interview, Mumsnet boss Justine Roberts said parents on the forum had spoken of how they struggled to manage their children's use of Roblox.",
      "\"There are parental controls, and our users would urge constant parental supervision,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"But we all know that with the best will in the world life sometimes gets in the way.",
      "\"If you've got multiple children you're looking after and things happen, and you probably can't 24/7 watch everything they're doing, even if you've got all your parental controls set.\"",
      "Ellie Gibson - from the Scummy Mummies podcast - said Mr Baszucki's message risked sounding \"a bit of a get out\".",
      "\"It's much easier said than done, especially when all their friends are playing it,\" she told the BBC.",
      "Gaming giant",
      "US-based Roblox is one of the world's largest games platforms, with more monthly users than Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation combined. In 2024 it averaged more than 80 million players per day \u2013 roughly 40% of them below the age of 13. Its vast empire includes some 40 million user-generated games and experiences.",
      "In the UK the Online Safety Act, which comes in to force in April, has strict laws for all tech firms specifically aimed at protecting children from online harms.",
      "But Mr Baszucki says he remains confident in Roblox's safety tools and insists the firm goes above and beyond to keep its users safe.",
      "\"We do in the company take the attitude that any bad, even one bad incident, is one too many,\" he says.",
      "\"We watch for bullying, we watch for harassment, we filter all of those kinds of things, and I would say behind the scenes, the analysis goes on all the way to, if necessary, reaching out to law enforcement.\"",
      "Players who choose not to display what he calls \"civility\" can face temporary time-outs and longer bans, and Roblox claims to analyse all communications that pass between members on the platform, increasingly using more advanced AI systems and other tech to do so \u2014 and anything flagged is sent for further investigation.",
      "In November last year, under 13s were banned from sending direct messages, and also from playing in \"hangout experiences\" which features chat between players.",
      "Safety filters bypassed",
      "However, the BBC was able to create two fake accounts, one aged 15 and one aged 27, on unlinked devices and exchange messages between the two.",
      "While the filters caught our attempts to overtly move the conversation onto a different platform, we found easy ways to re-word requests to chat elsewhere and make suggestions about playing more adult games.",
      "When we showed the Roblox boss these findings, he argued that our example highlighted the comparative safety of Roblox: that people felt they had to take content which might breach Roblox's rules to other platforms.",
      "\"We don't condone any type of image-sharing on our own platform, and you'll see us getting more and more, I think, way beyond where the law is on this type of behaviour,\" Mr Baszucki says.",
      "He admits there is a delicate balance between encouraging friendships between young people, and blocking opportunities for them come to harm, but says he is confident Roblox can manage both.",
      "We also put to him some Roblox game titles that the BBC has discovered were recommended by the platform to an 11 year-old recently, including:",
      "'Late Night Boys And Girls Club RP''Special Forces Simulator'''Squid Game''Shoot down planes\u2026because why not?'",
      "'Late Night Boys And Girls Club RP'",
      "'Special Forces Simulator''",
      "'Squid Game'",
      "'Shoot down planes\u2026because why not?'",
      "When we asked whether he thought they were appropriate, he said he puts his faith in the platform's age rating systems.",
      "\"One thing that's really important for the way we do things here, is it's not just on the title of the experience, it's literally on the content of the experience as well,\" he says.",
      "He insists that when Roblox rates experience, they go through rigorous guidelines and that the company has a \"consistent policy\" on that.",
      "How can you keep your child safe online?",
      "Plan to make phone use safer for teens watered down",
      "Mr Baszucki founded the platform with Eric Cassel in 2004 and released it to the public in 2006 \u2013 a year before the first Apple iPhone appeared, heralding the start of the smartphone era.",
      "Mr Baszucki describes his younger self as \"less of a gamer, and more of an engineer\", and the pair's first company was an education software provider called Knowledge Revolution. But they soon noticed that kids weren't only using the product to do their homework.",
      "\"They wanted to play and build stuff. They were making houses or ships or scenery, and they wanted to jump in, and all of that learning was the germination of Roblox,\" he says.",
      "The name Roblox was a mash-up of the words \"robot\" and blocks\" \u2013 and it stuck. The platform grew quickly in popularity \u2013 and there were also early warning signs of its future issues.",
      "Mr Cassel noticed some players \"starting to act out\" and not always behaving in a \"civilised\" way a couple of months after it launched, recalls Mr Baszucki.",
      "He says the roots of building a \"trust and safety system\" therefore began \"very, very early\" and that in those earlier days there were four people acting as safety moderators.",
      "\"It kind of is what launched this safety civility foundation,\" he adds.",
      "But despite attracting decent numbers, it was a year later, when the firm launched its digital currency Robux, that it really started to make money.",
      "Players buy Robux and use it to purchase accessories and unlock content. Content creators now get 70% of the fee, and the store operates on dynamic pricing, meaning popular items cost more.",
      "Mr Baszucki says there was some initial resistance among the leadership team about Roblox becoming more than a hobby for its players, with the introduction of a digital economy.",
      "Robux stayed, and the firm is now worth $41bn (\u00a331bn).",
      "Its share price has fluctuated since it went public in 2021, but overall Roblox shares are worth about one third more than they were six months ago, at the time of writing. Like many big tech firms its value peaked during Covid, when lockdowns meant millions of people were indoors.",
      "Mr Baszucki compares his experience of building Roblox with how Walt Disney may have felt about his creations.",
      "He describes his job as \"a little like having the opportunity he had a long time ago when he was designing the Magic Kingdom\", and is focused on Roblox's ongoing evolution into a Metaverse-style experience where people go about their daily lives in a virtual world, in avatar form.",
      "They have also been public in their ambitions to eventually attract 10% of the world's gamers.",
      "Asked to describe Roblox in three words, he replies: \"The future of communication.\"",
      "We finish our time together playing a couple of his favourite games: Natural Disaster Survival and Dress to Impress.",

      "Deena Ghazarian had only been in business for a year when the trade policies of President Donald Trump's first term of office sent her company into a tailspin.",
      "It was 2019 and her California-based firm, Austere, had just agreed to supply several big US retailers with its high-end audio and video accessories that are largely manufactured in China.",
      "Then Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on China, and overnight Deena found herself paying a 25% surcharge on every cable and component she imported \u2013 up from zero previously.",
      "She was forced to absorb the costs and for a while thought she would go bust.",
      "\"I literally thought I am going to start and end a business in less than a year,\" she says. \"I had spent all this time, money and effort, and to have something like this blindside you was shocking.\"",
      "The firm pulled through, but like numerous other US businesses it now finds itself in a strikingly similar situation.",
      "Since returning to office in January, Mr Trump has raised tariffs on all goods imported from China by 20%, and put taxes of 25% on Canadian and Mexican products, only to delay some of them until April.",
      "The president says he wants to force these countries to do more to stop flows of illegal drugs and migrants into America, to bring more manufacturing back to the US, and to address what he sees as unfair trade imbalances.",
      "But the duties are much broader in scope than last time, when they were phased in gradually and many products were granted exemptions.",
      "Goods like smartphones, desktop computers and tablets are now incurring tariffs for the first time, while taxes on others have climbed higher.",
      "\"US importers have to pay these taxes not the exporters,\" says Ed Brzytwa, vice president of international trade at the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), a North American trade body that represents more than 1,200 tech firms.",
      "\"It's American businesses and consumers who will suffer.\"",
      "Businesses like Ms Ghazarian's are particularly exposed. China is still the number one supplier of electronic products to the US, with imports totalling $146bn (\u00a3112bn) in 2023, according to official data.",

      "'I will have to raise prices by 10%' - toymakers warn of tariff pain",
      "China retaliates against US tariffs - but it also wants to talk",
      "While many American companies like Austere have diversified their supply chains away from China since Mr Trump's first term, countries such as Thailand, Taiwan and Vietnam still do not offer the same manufacturing capabilities and expertise.",
      "At the same time, the US president is now targeting Mexico - another major electronics supplier. And while domestic manufacturing in the US has increased, partly due to tariffs, it is still limited by higher costs and stricter regulations.",
      "\"Yes, Apple now makes some iPhones in India and [the Taiwanese chipmaker] TSMC has been diversifying to Arizona,\" says Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC.",
      "\"But China is still a massive part of the supply chain. Relationships with new suppliers take time to develop, they are costly to develop.\"",
      "Research suggests that companies pass on a large proportion of the costs of tariffs by putting up prices. Earlier this month Corie Barry, boss of US electronics retailer Best Buy, said that the \"the vast majority\" of the new tariffs will \"probably be passed on to the consumer\" because vendors in the industry have such small margins.",
      "In February, Taiwanese firm Acer said the price of its laptops would likely rise by 10% based on the 10% duties in place on China at the time, while US group HP has warned its profits would be lower because of the tariffs.",
      "Ms Ghazarian says she may have to raise her prices this year, but worries it could backfire. \"There is a price point where the customer is satisfied with the value of goods provided.",
      "\"The moment I shift above that I start to lose customers. High inflation has squeezed Americans.\"",
      "During Mr Trump's first term, companies such as Apple successfully secured exemptions for products, and we may yet see carve-outs.",
      "Insiders have also suggested Mr Trump views tariffs as a negotiating tactic and could ease them if he wins concessions, as he did when China agreed to buy more American goods in a deal reached in 2020.",
      "Fears of a US economic slowdown could also make him change course.",
      "For the time being, though, tensions look likely to escalate. China, Mexico and Canada have vowed to retaliate against any US duties imposed on them, and this week Mr Trump threatened to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium only to row back at the last minute.",
      "He plans to impose \"reciprocal tariffs\" on the rest of the world soon, and threatened tariff increases of up to 60% on Chinese goods while on the campaign trail.",
      "There is a risk this could drive up the price of tech goods around the world if China is forced to relocate manufacturing to countries where labour costs are higher. Moreover, countries may hit back with tariffs on imported US technology.",
      "Ms Ghazarian says she is worried but at least she's prepared this time. Like many other US business-owners she bulk-ordered extra inventory before Mr Trump took office, and is storing it in her east coast warehouse.",
      "She hopes that will get the company through the next year until it can \"pivot\" again.",

    "summary": "Market researchers say the slumping popularity of the market-leading Apple Watch was to blame",
    "story": [
      "Global sales of smartwatches have fallen for the first time, new figures indicate, in large part due to a sharp decline in the popularity of market leader, Apple.",
      "Market research firm Counterpoint says 7% fewer of the devices were shipped in 2024 compared to the year before.",
      "Shipments of Apple Watches fell by 19% in that period, Counterpoint says.",
      "It blames the slump on a lack of new features in Apple's latest devices, and the fact a rumoured high-end Ultra 3 model never materialised.",
      "\"The biggest driver of the decline was North America, where the absence of the Ultra 3 and minimal feature upgrades in the S10 lineup led consumers to hold back purchases,\" said Counterpoint senior research analyst Anshika Jain.",
      "Apple was also hit with sales and import bans in the US in late 2023 and early 2024 over a disputed patent regarding blood oxygen level monitoring - which Ms Jain says also contributed to lower sales figures in the first half of 2024.",
      "It retained 22% of market share in the final three months of 2024, down from 25% a year earlier.",
      "\"We've been through a period where the smartwatch has gone from being a new and exciting gadget, to something now that's stabilising - the feature set isn't changing very dramatically year over year,\" said Leo Gebbie, principal analyst at CCS Insight.",
      "Despite the overall decline, last year did see a massive rise in sales for Chinese-made smartwatches from brands such as Xiaomi, Huawei and Imoo.",
      "Sales in China also grew from 19% of the market to 25% in the year from the last quarter of 2023.",
      "This was the first time it recorded more smartwatch sales than India or North America, according to Counterpoint.",
      "The Chinese manufacturers also appeared to tap into another trend - the growing popularity of smartwatches for children, the only segment of the market to grow in 2024.",
      "Imoo, known in China as \"Little Genius\", specialises in children's smart watches and saw a 22% rise in shipments.",
      "\"The kids' smart watch segment is gaining traction as parents are concerned for their children's safety, and they desire to track and stay constantly connected with their children,\" Counterpoint's Balbir Singh said.",
      "But Imoo was eclipsed by a 135% rise in shipments from Beijing-based tech company Xiaomi.",
      "Its Smart Band activity trackers sell for a fraction of the price of rivals made by Apple and Samsung.",
      "\"We're seeing the large consumer electronics players like Apple and Samsung really just look to drive a way higher margin and not engage in the price war,\" said Mr Gebbie.",
      "\"Xiaomi has done a really good job of selling devices, particularly in regions like southern and eastern Europe where that greater affordability tends to resonate a lot more strongly with customers.\"",
      "Another large contributor to the global sales drop was India, which fell from 30% of the market to 23%.",
      "He said this was partly because of a \"bubble\" in ultra-cheap devices from Indian manufacturers which has now burst.",
      "\"We read and saw a lot in terms of complaints about the quality of devices, with people being unhappy with them,\" he said.",
      "\"For those companies, there's been a sense that from this point onwards they would be better served by maybe making and selling products with a slightly longer lifespan.\"",
      "Counterpoint says it expects a small recovery in the global market, with \"single-digit percentage growth in 2025\".",
      "It predicts the uptick in sales will be driven by the increasing adoption of AI features, and a greater emphasis of providing a wider range of health data.",

      "He said it was unlikely that patient information was taken from Medefer, but that without a full investigation, the company could not have known for sure.",
      "\"I've worked in organisations where, if something like this happened, the whole system would be taken down immediately,\" he said.",
      "On discovering the flaw the engineer told the company that an external cybersecurity expert should be brought in to investigate the problem, which he says the company did not do.",
      "Medefer says the external security agency has confirmed that it has found no evidence of any breach of data and that all the company's data systems were currently secure.",
      "It says the process of investigating and fixing the API flaw was \"extremely open\".",
      "Medefer said it had reported the issue to the ICO (Information Commissioner's Office)  and the CQC (Care Quality Commission), \"in the interests of transparency\", and that the ICO had confirmed there is no further action to be taken as there is no evidence of a breach.",
      "The engineer, who had been contracted in October to test for flaws in the company's software, left the company in January.",
      "In a statement Dr Bahman Nedjat-Shokouhi, founder and CEO of Medefer, said: \"There is no evidence of any patient data breach from our systems.\"",
      "He confirmed that the flaw had been discovered in November and a fix was developed in 48 hours.",
      "\"The external security agency has asserted that the allegation that this flaw could have provided access to large amounts of patients' data is categorically false.\"",
      "The security agency will complete its review later this week.",
      "Dr Nedjat-Shokouhi added: \"We take our duties to patients and the NHS very seriously. We hold regular external security audits of our systems by independent external security agencies, undertaken on multiple occasions every year.\"",
      "Cybersecurity experts, who have looked at information supplied by the software engineer, have expressed their concern.",
      "\"There is the possibility that Medefer stored data derived from the NHS not as securely as one would hope it would be,\" said Prof Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert at the University of Surrey.",
      "\"The database might be encrypted and all the other precautions taken, but if there is a way of glitching the API authorisation, anyone who knows how could potentially gain access,\" he added.",
      "Another expert pointed out that as Medefer deals with highly-sensitive, medical data, the company should have brought in cybersecurity experts as soon as the problem was identified.",
      "\"Even if the company suspected that no data was stolen, when facing an issue that could have resulted in a data breach, especially with data of the nature in question, an investigation and confirmation from a suitably qualified cybersecurity expert would be advisable,\" says Scott Helme, a security researcher.",
      "Medefer was founded in 2013 by Dr Nedjat-Shokouhi, with a goal to improve outpatient care. Since then its technology has been used by NHS trusts across England.",

      "\"Who will give the order to end the fighting? At what cost? Who decides who has broken any possible ceasefire, over 2,000km? All those questions need meticulous work from both sides. Who polices it?\"",

      "His wife recalled the moment the Pakistan military arrived to meet them.",
      "\"They told me, 'ma'am, come inside with us, we will take you home safely,'\" she said. The soldiers took the couple to the town of Machh, she added, \"and then we reached Quetta to our children, who were waiting for us\".",

    "story": [
      "Germany's foreign intelligence service believed there was a 80-90% chance that coronavirus accidentally leaked from a Chinese lab, German media say.",
      "Two German newspapers say they have uncovered details of an assessment carried out by spy agency BND in 2020 but never published.",
      "The intelligence service had indications that the Wuhan Institute of Virology had been carrying out experiments where viruses are modified to become more transmissible to humans for research, they say.",
      "China repeated its denial saying the cause \"should be determined by scientists\" - and pointed to a World Health Organization investigation which found the lab-leak theory was \"extremely unlikely\".",
      "There is no consensus on the cause of the Covid pandemic.",
      "The lab leak hypothesis has been hotly contested by scientists, including many who say there is no definitive evidence to back it up.",
      "But the once controversial theory has been gaining ground among some intelligence agencies - and the BND is the latest to entertain the theory. In January, the US CIA said the coronavirus was \"more likely\" to have leaked from a lab than to have come from animals.",
      "According to Die Zeit and Sueddeutscher Zeitung, the BND met in Berlin in 2020 to look into the origin of coronavirus in an operation called Project Saaremaa.",
      "It assessed the lab theory as \"likely\", although it did not have definitive proof.",
      "The BND also found indications that several violations of safety regulations had occurred at the lab.",
      "The assessment was commissioned by the office of Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor at the time, but was never publicly known of until now.",
      "According to the papers, the findings were shared with the CIA in autumn of last year.",
      "In January this year, the CIA said that a \"research-related origin\" of the pandemic was more likely than a natural origin \"based on the available body of reporting\" - although it cautioned it had \"low confidence\" in this determination.",
      "Both the BND and outgoing chancellor Olaf Scholz declined to comment.",
      "China's foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said in response: \"We believe that tracing the origin of Covid-19 is a scientific issue that should be determined by scientists with a scientific approach.",
      "\"The conclusion that a laboratory leak is extremely unlikely was reached by the China-WHO joint expert team after on-site visits to relevant labs in Wuhan and in-depth discussions with researchers.",
      "\"This authoritative scientific conclusion has been widely recognised by the international community and the scientific community.",
      "\"China firmly opposes any form of political manipulation on the issue of Covid-19 origin tracing.\"",
      "Why Covid lab-leak theory is so disputed",
      "CIA says lab leak most likely source of Covid outbreak",
      "The WHO investigation in early 2021 saw a team of scientists fly to Wuhan on a mission to look into the source of the pandemic.",
      "After spending 12 days there, which included a visit to the laboratory, the team concluded the lab-leak theory was \"extremely unlikely\".",
      "But many have since questioned their findings, with one prominent group of scientists criticising the WHO report for not taking the lab-leak theory seriously enough - it was dismissed in a few pages of a several-hundred-page report.",
      "Supporters of the natural origin hypothesis - which was backed in the WHO report - say Covid-19 emerged in bats and then jumped to humans, most likely through another animal, or \"intermediary host\".",
      "This hypothesis was widely accepted at the start of the pandemic, but as time has worn on, scientists have not found a virus in either bats or another animal that matches the genetic make-up of Covid-19, leading some to doubt the theory."

      "Government spokesman Nick Mangwana was quick to allay the public's fears, explaining the tanks were in the capital that mid-February morning as part of a scheduled exercise to test equipment and were \"nothing to be concerned about\".",
      "Yet the chatter and speculation continued, revealing much about the state of the country.",
      "Ahead of the routine military drill, President Emmerson Mnangagwa had, for the first time since becoming president in 2017, faced harsh criticism about his leadership from within his Zanu-PF party with calls for him to step down.",
      "The accusations evoked memories of the lead-up to the coup that toppled his predecessor, long-time leader Robert Mugabe.",
      "He had come to power in 1980 as the revolutionary hero who ended decades of white-minority rule. But his demise was heralded when veterans of the 1970s war of independence withdrew their support for him.",
      "It was a war veteran and senior Zanu-PF member named Blessed Geza, also known as \"Bombshell\", who launched a verbal offensive against Mnangagwa.",

      "In a series of often expletive-laden press conferences, gritty-voiced and with a furrowed forehead, he repeatedly called on the 82-year-old president to go or face being removed.",
      "\"I must apologise for helping him come into office,\" said Geza in one press conference aired on social media about the president, who goes by the nickname \"The Crocodile\".",
      "\"As soon as he [Mnangagwa] had the taste of power, he escalated corruption, forgot the people and only remembered his family,\" said the outspoken war veteran, who was then a member of Zanu-PF's powerful central committee.",
      "\"Mnangagwa has also surrendered state power to his wife and children. We sadly see history repeating itself. We can't allow that to happen.\"",

      "Blessed Mhlanga, the journalist who first interviewed Bombshell back in November, has also been arrested on charges of transmitting a message that incites violence.",
      "Trouble began brewing over Mnangagwa's ambitions to stay in office during Zanu-PF rallies last year. The president is currently serving his second and final term, which expires in 2028.",
      "The slogan \"2030 he will still be the leader\" began to be uttered by his supporters despite Zimbabwe's constitution limiting presidential terms to two five-year terms.",
      "They argued that he would need to remain in office to complete his \"Agenda 2030\" development programme as he was doing such great work.",
      "A motion was then adopted unanimously at Zanu-PF's conference in December that did not explicitly speak of a third term but sought to extend Mnangagwa's existing term until 2030.",
      "Despite a recent assurance from Mnangagwa that he did intend to step down in three years, the influential Roman Catholic bishops have become involved.",
      "In a pastoral letter last week, Zimbabwe's Catholic Bishops Conference warned that the 2030 debate was a distraction from the things that truly mattered - business closures, high unemployment, rampant corruption and economic policies that favour the wealthy at the expense of ordinary Zimbabweans.",
      "Presidential spokesman George Charamba expressed his disappointment about the clerics' pronouncement, telling the state-run Herald newspaper the matter was now \"dead and buried\".",
      "Nonetheless, Bombshell's message seems to have landed. It has resulted in a purge in Zanu-PF, with the expulsion of Geza and some of his allies.",
      "Yet political analyst Takura Zhangazha says Geza's outburst is unlikely to galvanise crowds to his cause.",
      "These days people are less interested in such political spectacles, he says, unlike at the time of Mugabe's downfall when Zimbabweans, including opposition party supporters, turned out en masse to support the coup - thanking the military and the war veterans.",
      "\"Even that attempt by Geza to talk about corruption and the plight of the workers - it's not going to get people riled up, organising, mobilising. They don't have that capacity or interest any more,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"I can promise you there's no repeat of 2017 before 2028,\" he said, adding that Zimbabweans feel they were used in the ousting of Mugabe  and would not be brought out on the streets again for Zanu-PF's internal battles.",
      "This is also because there are splits across the political landscape, including a weak opposition.",
      "Even the war veterans do not represent a united front, Mr Zhangazha says.",

    "story": [
      "Deena Ghazarian had only been in business for a year when the trade policies of President Donald Trump's first term of office sent her company into a tailspin.",
      "It was 2019 and her California-based firm, Austere, had just agreed to supply several big US retailers with its high-end audio and video accessories that are largely manufactured in China.",
      "Then Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on China, and overnight Deena found herself paying a 25% surcharge on every cable and component she imported \u2013 up from zero previously.",
      "She was forced to absorb the costs and for a while thought she would go bust.",
      "\"I literally thought I am going to start and end a business in less than a year,\" she says. \"I had spent all this time, money and effort, and to have something like this blindside you was shocking.\"",
      "The firm pulled through, but like numerous other US businesses it now finds itself in a strikingly similar situation.",
      "Since returning to office in January, Mr Trump has raised tariffs on all goods imported from China by 20%, and put taxes of 25% on Canadian and Mexican products, only to delay some of them until April.",
      "The president says he wants to force these countries to do more to stop flows of illegal drugs and migrants into America, to bring more manufacturing back to the US, and to address what he sees as unfair trade imbalances.",
      "But the duties are much broader in scope than last time, when they were phased in gradually and many products were granted exemptions.",
      "Goods like smartphones, desktop computers and tablets are now incurring tariffs for the first time, while taxes on others have climbed higher.",
      "\"US importers have to pay these taxes not the exporters,\" says Ed Brzytwa, vice president of international trade at the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), a North American trade body that represents more than 1,200 tech firms.",
      "\"It's American businesses and consumers who will suffer.\"",
      "Businesses like Ms Ghazarian's are particularly exposed. China is still the number one supplier of electronic products to the US, with imports totalling $146bn (\u00a3112bn) in 2023, according to official data.",
      "Meanwhile, 87% of US video game console imports came from China that year, 78% of smartphones, 79% of laptops and tablets, and two-thirds of monitors, says the CTA.",

      "'I will have to raise prices by 10%' - toymakers warn of tariff pain",
      "China retaliates against US tariffs - but it also wants to talk",
      "While many American companies like Austere have diversified their supply chains away from China since Mr Trump's first term, countries such as Thailand, Taiwan and Vietnam still do not offer the same manufacturing capabilities and expertise.",
      "At the same time, the US president is now targeting Mexico - another major electronics supplier. And while domestic manufacturing in the US has increased, partly due to tariffs, it is still limited by higher costs and stricter regulations.",
      "\"Yes, Apple now makes some iPhones in India and [the Taiwanese chipmaker] TSMC has been diversifying to Arizona,\" says Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC.",
      "\"But China is still a massive part of the supply chain. Relationships with new suppliers take time to develop, they are costly to develop.\"",
      "Research suggests that companies pass on a large proportion of the costs of tariffs by putting up prices. Earlier this month Corie Barry, boss of US electronics retailer Best Buy, said that the \"the vast majority\" of the new tariffs will \"probably be passed on to the consumer\" because vendors in the industry have such small margins.",
      "In February, Taiwanese firm Acer said the price of its laptops would likely rise by 10% based on the 10% duties in place on China at the time, while US group HP has warned its profits would be lower because of the tariffs.",
      "Ms Ghazarian says she may have to raise her prices this year, but worries it could backfire. \"There is a price point where the customer is satisfied with the value of goods provided.",
      "\"The moment I shift above that I start to lose customers. High inflation has squeezed Americans.\"",
      "During Mr Trump's first term, companies such as Apple successfully secured exemptions for products, and we may yet see carve-outs.",
      "Insiders have also suggested Mr Trump views tariffs as a negotiating tactic and could ease them if he wins concessions, as he did when China agreed to buy more American goods in a deal reached in 2020.",
      "Fears of a US economic slowdown could also make him change course.",
      "For the time being, though, tensions look likely to escalate. China, Mexico and Canada have vowed to retaliate against any US duties imposed on them, and this week Mr Trump threatened to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium only to row back at the last minute.",
      "He plans to impose \"reciprocal tariffs\" on the rest of the world soon, and threatened tariff increases of up to 60% on Chinese goods while on the campaign trail.",
      "There is a risk this could drive up the price of tech goods around the world if China is forced to relocate manufacturing to countries where labour costs are higher. Moreover, countries may hit back with tariffs on imported US technology.",
      "Ms Ghazarian says she is worried but at least she's prepared this time. Like many other US business-owners she bulk-ordered extra inventory before Mr Trump took office, and is storing it in her east coast warehouse.",
      "She hopes that will get the company through the next year until it can \"pivot\" again.",
      "\"That might mean finding a more cost-effective way to produce the product or doing something completely different. It's frustrating I have to focus on survival rather than growing my business.\"",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5ng663d1wo",
    "published": "Wed, 12 Mar 2025 17:09:20 GMT",
    "summary": "As the president tries to force Mexico to stop the flow of drugs, cartel members tell Quentin Sommerville they will not be deterred.",
    "story": [
      "The fentanyl dealer from Los Angeles stands to the side watching carefully as a Mexican drugs cartel operative prepares his latest shipment. The synthetic opioid drug is wrapped in foil, sealed in plastic, then dropped with an oily splash into the petrol tank of the trafficker's nondescript car.",
      "Jay, not his real name, had crossed earlier from the US to this cartel-run safe house on the Mexican side of the border. The house looks like any other in this neighbourhood. We are told to drive in quickly and an iron gate closes firmly behind us. They don't cook the drug here, but still they are wary of attracting attention. The men all speak in hushed voices and work quickly.",
      "Their lethal business has become the centre of a global economic dispute. The White House has used fentanyl smuggling through US borders as a key justification for raising tariffs on other nations. US President Donald Trump has also vowed to \"wage war\" on the drug cartels.",
      "The BBC gained rare access to a cartel's operation along the border and travelled to the US to meet their ultimate customers, to see if the international row was doing anything to halt the illegal flow of narcotics.",
      "The men we meet at the safe house are foot-soldiers of a well-known cartel. Two of them loading the car admit to fleeting moments of remorse. But when I ask the man packing the drugs into the fuel tank if he feels guilty about the deaths the pills cause, he sniggers. \"We have family too, of course we feel guilty. But if I stop, it's going to continue. It's not my problem,\" he tells me with a shrug.",
      "The men keep their faces covered while they remove the back seat of the car to gain access to the tank, taking care not to spill petrol. The smell inside the car could alert customs officers on the other side of the border that the fuel tank has been tampered with.",
      "The light green pills, 5,000 in total and marked with an M, are packed tightly - a fraction of what Jay says he sells every week in LA and across the American northwest.",
      "\"I try to get 100,000 pills a week, every week,\" the softly spoken dealer tells me. \"I don't send them in one vehicle. I try to spread it in different cars. That way I minimise my risk of losing all my pills.\"",
      "A 25% tariff on all goods from Mexico was introduced in response to what President Donald Trump said was the unacceptable flow of illegal drugs and illegal immigrants into the US. Some of those tariffs have since been delayed until 2 April.",
      "Defeating the fentanyl trade is one of President Trump's top policy goals, but Jay doesn't rate his chances.",
      "\"Last time he was in office, he tried to do the same thing, and it never happened. There's always going to be a demand. And where's the biggest demand? United States, lucky for us. We're here in the border,\" says Jay with a smile.",
      "There is so much of the drug flowing into the US, most of it coming from Mexico, that according to Jay the price he sells it for in LA has fallen from about $5 or $6 per pill a year ago, to $1.50 now (\u00a31.16).",
      "Mexican police say cartels switched in a big way to fentanyl, which is 50 times more potent than heroin, because unlike other opiates - which are made from the opium poppy - it is completely synthetic and much easier to make and transport.",
      "Fentanyl's strength and addictiveness has left a deep scar on American society: drug overdoses kill more people in the US than guns or car crashes. Fatalities have started to decline, perhaps due in part to the greater availability of Naloxone, a drug that reverses the effects of overdoses of opioids. But the latest figures are still stark: 87,000 overdose deaths (mostly from opioids) from October 2023 to September 2024, down from 114,000 the year before.",
      "In an attempt to stave off punitive tariffs from the White House, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has pledged to send 10,000 National Guard troops to the border. The government has made more than 900 arrests since October in Sinaloa, a major drug trafficking hub. Back in December, Mexico announced its biggest ever fentanyl seizure in the state: more than a tonne of pills. In fact, the country has seized more fentanyl in the past five months than it did in the previous year.",
      "Mexico has also made it harder to import a key ingredient of fentanyl from China, prompting cartels to reduce the strength of each pill - and, in the process, making them less deadly.",
      "And at the end of February, 29 senior drug cartel figures were handed over to the United States, including members of five of the six Mexican crime syndicates that President Trump's administration recently designated as terrorist organisations.",
      "President Sheinbaum also said she had agreed to the CIA increasing surveillance drone operations over Mexican territory in search of fentanyl drugs labs, after the media revealed the covert missions.",
      "Jay acknowledges the dangers of his trade to himself and his customers, but is untroubled.",
      "\"They always try to blame us, that we are the ones that are poisoning American citizens. But they're the biggest users.\"",
      "He coolly insulates himself from responsibility and guilt for the deaths his drugs cause. He claims not to know anyone who has died using his product. \"I only deal with other suppliers,\" he tells me.",
      "The cartels mostly use American citizens to courier their drugs across the border, as they are less likely to be stopped by US Customs and Border Protection. The driver, who goes by the name Charlie, has a US passport. He, too, is mostly indifferent to the suffering the fentanyl epidemic has caused.",
      "\"I need the money,\" he says. When I ask him how many times he has made the drugs run, he replies: \"Too many.\" (I later learn that the 5,000 pills in the fuel tank made it across the border without incident.)",
      "President Sheinbaum has also recently emphasised the demand side of the crisis, saying the US fentanyl crisis began with the legal but \"irresponsible approval\" of painkillers, such as OxyContin, starting in the late 1990s. \"The US government should take responsibility for the opioid-consumption crisis that has caused so many deaths,\" she said at a daily news conference.",
      "On the other side of the border is Derek Maltz, who has spent a lifetime in US drug enforcement. He has been made the interim leader of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and spoke to me just before his appointment.",
      "\"The Mexican cartels need to know that we're coming down there,\" he tells me. \"We're going to have aggressive operations to go after you and your business because you are killing our American kids at record levels and it's not going to be tolerated.\"",
      "Mr Maltz agrees, though, that targeting the cartels alone will not solve the opioid crisis. \"The cartels are very bad guys,\" he tells me. \"They're transnational criminals. They're narco-terrorists. However, there is a bad demand problem in America, we have to address why our population is turning to drugs for help.\"",
      "In Philadelphia's Kensington neighbourhood - dubbed the largest open-air drugs market on the US east coast - Rosalind Pichardo of Operation Save Our City is on to her second Bible. She records in the book's back pages the number of times she has reversed an opioid overdose using the quick-acting drug Naloxone.",
      "For the past six years, the figure totals 2,931. She flicks through the pages and that number written in red comes alive with the memories of the individuals she saved, and the ones she lost.",
      "She begins to list: \"Male in his 60s\u2026 male 30s\u2026 female in her 30s, very thin, no hair.\" Beside each name in this roll-call of fentanyl victims, is the number of doses of Naloxone - sold under the name Narcan - she used to attempt to revive people.",
      "Ms Pichardo, who runs a drop-in centre called Sunshine House, operates what she calls a \"no-judgement zone\". She bristles at the terms like \"addict\", \"junkie\" or \"zombie\", which have been used to describe the people of her neighbourhood. Instead, she calls everyone \"sunshine\".",
      "Some she doesn't remember; others she will never forget.",
      "\"Look at this one, seven years old, two Narcans,\" she points out. Ms Pichardo had been called to a neighbour's house where a woman was holding in her arms a child who had turned blue. Ms Pichardo went inside and the girl was placed on the floor, but as she entered the child's father ran upstairs carrying a bag. \"I'm thinking if that was my child, I'd be running to help the child,\" she recalls.",
      "At first, she thought it might be epilepsy, but she spotted drug scales and plastic baggies on a nearby table. The kid's dad was a drug dealer; the seven-year-old had been poisoned by his stash and overdosed. \"I was livid,\" she says.",
      "Those two doses of Narcan were enough to save the child's life.",
      "On another page, a woman, six months pregnant, two doses of Narcan. She also survived.",
      "In Kensington, drugs are cheap and plentiful, and people shoot up in the open. As she walks the neighbourhood, Ms Pichardo finds people passed out on the pavement, a woman in a stupor with her trousers down, a man lying prone next to a metro turnstile, another man in a wheelchair, his eyes closed and money in his hands.",
      "He, like a growing number of opioid users, has had a limb amputated. A new drug on the street, the animal tranquilliser Xylazine, is being mixed with fentanyl. It leads to open wounds which become infected. The air is rank in places.",
      "John White is 56 years old, and for 40 of those years he has struggled with addiction. At Sunshine House, Ms Pichardo serves him a bowl of homemade soup.",
      "\"I've been in this city all my life,\" he says. \"The fentanyl and opioid epidemic is the worst I've ever seen. Fentanyl will get you so hooked that you have to get more. So they put it in everything.\"",
      "Mr White had a fentanyl overdose after smoking a joint laced with the drug: it is being added to all kinds of illicit drugs, including heroin, cocaine and marijuana.",
      "Ms Pichardo holds out little hope that even if the fentanyl trade is cut off from Mexico, it will improve people's lives in Kensington.",
      "\"The problem that we have with the war on drugs is - it didn't work then [and] I don't believe it's going to work now,\" she explains.",
      "When the supply of one drug is cut off, another replaces it, she says. \"Once there was heroin, now there's no more. Now there's fentanyl. When there's no fentanyl, now it's going to be Xylazine. So it's like they'll find a way to keep people addicted so that people can make money off of people, off the suffering of people,\" says Ms Pichardo.",
      "Directly across from Sunshine House, a young woman is found collapsed on the pavement, her body splayed across the concrete: she's unresponsive. Ms Pichardo is quickly on the scene, her medical kit by her side, yet again administering Naloxone. The woman is eventually revived - she will survive.",
      "Roz Pichardo returns to Sunshine House, another life saved and another digit to be added to the back pages of her tattered Bible.",

      "South Africa has entered uncharted waters following deep divisions in the coalition government over the national budget that has finally been tabled after a month-long delay.",
      "This is the view of analysts after Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana's budget drew a backlash from various quarters, including key partners in the coalition government rejecting his proposals for a second time.",
      "The African National Congress (ANC) formed a government of national unity (GNU) with nine other parties after losing its parliamentary majority in elections last year.",
      "And, without the support of its biggest coalition partner, the Democratic Alliance (DA), it will fail to pass the budget unless it rethinks its contentious policies or gets the backing of the biggest opposition parties.",
      "Godongwana was forced to postpone his budget presentation last month after fierce resistance to his plan to raise value-added-tax (VAT), which would have seen the prices of goods go up at a time when South Africans are hard-hit by the cost-of-living crisis.",

      "In his revised budget, the minister tried to appease his GNU partners by announcing a reduced VAT increase, to be implemented over a two-year period.",
      "Godongwana had initially proposed increasing VAT from15% to 17%, but has now suggested raising it to 16% in two stages.",
      "The minister says that increasing taxes is necessary to tackle \"persistent spending pressures in health, education, transport and security\".",
      "\"They [other parties] have to make a choice - do we close schools, hospitals or clinics? They have to make that choice. Do we fire people? That is the choice we have to make and that is not a good choice to make,\" Godongwana said.",
      "The minister added that he had opted to target VAT rather than personal and corporate taxes, as the latter two would generate less revenue while \"potentially harming investment, job creation and economic growth\".",
      "Godongwana's revised budget has the support of his party, the ANC, but has failed to appease the DA, which said it would not \"support any increase in taxes, unless those increases were temporary and the ANC agreed to a series of major reforms\" that would grow the economy, reduce waste and create jobs within the next three years.",

      "The two biggest opposition parties - former President Jacob Zuma's Umkhonto weSizwe (MK) and Julius Malema's Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) - have also rejected the budget, saying the proposed tax hikes would hit the poor the hardest.",
      "This leaves the ANC in a difficult situation, at it needs the support of at least one of the three other biggest parties to pass the budget.",
      "An analyst at South Africa's Wits University, Thokozile Madonko, says the deadlock over the budget has left South Africa in \"uncharted waters\".",
      "She tells the BBC that the role of parliament will now be \"absolutely critical\" as it either accepted, changed or rejected the budget.",
      "And while in the past the ANC could always push through its policies, this is no longer the case.",
      "This will force it to strike a deal with other parties or risk seeing the budget being voted down - something that could result in the collapse of the coalition government.",
      "Ms Madonko criticised Godongwana's decision to take the \"laziest option\" by proposing an increase in VAT, which will affect the entire population, rather than targeting the richest section of the population by introducing a \"wealth tax\" on them.",
      "Another expert, Adrian Saville, said the budget was a \"folly\" as the minister repeated many old promises to promote economic growth and create jobs in a country where unemployment is standing at more than 30%.",

    "summary": "The US is expected to present a 30-day ceasefire proposal to Russia in the coming days.",
    "story": [
      "Hours of talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday ended with a joint US-Ukraine statement backing an American-proposed 30-day ceasefire in the war with Russia.",
      "Trump administration officials see this as a major breakthrough towards the foreign policy goals of a leader who campaigned on a promise to end the war.",
      "For Ukraine, the joint announcement amounts to a critical reprieve for President Volodymyr Zelensky after a humiliating attack in the Oval Office a fortnight ago by Trump and Vice-President JD Vance.",
      "For Moscow, it shifts the onus to them, while the war itself intensifies.",
      "But so far only one side in the war - the one dependent on the Americans - has signed up. And the proposal is only eight paragraphs long, with meagre details beyond the desire to rapidly press ahead.",
      "So does it make a ceasefire plausible? And if so, can it end the war after Russia's full-scale invasion three years ago in a just and sustainable way, and on terms that keep the region and the world safe?",
      "Statement: \"Ukraine expressed readiness to accept the U.S. proposal to enact an immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire, which can be extended by mutual agreement of the parties, and which is subject to acceptance and concurrent implementation by the Russian Federation. The United States will communicate to Russia that Russian reciprocity is the key to achieving peace.\"",
      "Analysis: The key word here is \"immediate,\" which doesn't leave any doubt: Trump wants the guns to fall silent now. His sense of urgency, however, has often led to concerns in Europe.",
      "Many fear that rushing the desired outcome without first working out the terms takes the military pressure off Moscow as the invading power and could lead to a truce being exploited.",
      "They argue it empowers the occupying force.",
      "The fear is of ultimately leading Ukraine into an effective surrender. The theory is that Russia - the bigger, more populous and militarily more self-sufficient power - could use a truce without first establishing concessions to consolidate its forces, string out a negotiation process and wait to see what happens politically for Trump during his term while it holds on to everything it seized; and even then try to take more ground, building on its current occupation and potentially using a fracture in the Western alliance to threaten more of Europe.",
      "The process of negotiating terms before a ceasefire in conflicts can be important to ensure the sides convert current military threats into meaningful strategic gains.",

      "Trump dismisses these concerns, saying there will be security for Ukraine, but without saying how this will be assured. He has said Putin will be deterred and is in a difficult position with \"no choice\" but to make a deal for reasons that \"only I know\".",

      "Analysis: This is the big win for Zelensky in this agreement and sees US weapons supplies being delivered at a rate of around $2bn (\u00a31.5bn)-worth a month, restored.",
      "Critically, it also means Washington will once again share its intelligence data and satellite pictures with Kyiv, which helps it target Russian positions. The White House said it suspended this aid because it felt Zelensky wasn't \"committed\" to Trump's peace plan.",
      "The Ukrainian leader had tried to voice his concerns based on some of the reasons above when he was ejected from the Oval Office. His reservations are likely being set aside while he welcomes the agreement in this form - a necessary price to pay to restore US security assistance.",

The United States committed to discussing these specific proposals with representatives from Russia. The Ukrainian delegation reiterated that European partners shall be involved in the peace process.\"",
      "Analysis: This paragraph is confusing because it's unclear whether it refers to negotiations between Ukraine and the US on establishing any security guarantees for Ukraine, or if it refers to negotiations between Ukraine and Russia to permanently end the war once a ceasefire is under way.",
      "If it is the former, it appears to suggest that Washington and Kyiv will hammer out any decisions on how to back up Ukraine's security and deter Russian breaches of a truce, and the US will then discuss these with Moscow.",
      "But it is all a far cry from the kind of security guarantee Zelensky ultimately wanted, which was membership of Nato, which Trump has said won't happen - a major long-term concession to Moscow's demands.",
      "The paragraph also contains a vague and lukewarm reference to the idea of European peacekeepers, which have been pitched by the UK and France, with the line attributed only to the Ukrainian delegation.",
      "It's notable that the US appears not to be putting its name to this part after Moscow categorically rejected the idea.",

      "It would give the US a future stake in some of Ukraine's state-owned mineral deposits, as well as oil and gas revenues.",
      "Trump sees it as an effective security guarantee for Ukraine, arguing it would deter Russian re-invasion because American companies would be on the ground.",

    "story": [
      "A columnist who has worked at The Washington Post for four decades resigned on Monday after she said the newspaper's management decided not to run her commentary critical of owner Jeff Bezos' new editorial policy.",
      "\"It breaks my heart to conclude that I must leave,\" Ruth Marcus, who has\u00a0worked\u00a0at the newspaper since 1984, wrote in a resignation letter.",
      "Her exit is the latest fallout from the billionaire owner's directive that the Post narrow the topics covered by its opinion section to personal liberties and the free market. The newspaper's opinions editor, David Shipley, had already resigned because of the shift.",
      "The storied newspaper has been in a free fall, financially and editorially, over the past year. Marcus, who worked in the news and opinion departments during her career, is \"the bedrock of The Washington Post, embodying the history of the place as well as the talent and accomplishments of its journalists,\" said Paul Farhi, a former media reporter there.",
      "Marcus, who was a finalist for the\u00a0Pulitzer Prize for Commentary\u00a0in 2007, said that the Post's publisher, Will Lewis, declined to run her column, which she described as \"respectfully dissenting\" from Bezos' edict. It was the first time in nearly 20 years of writing columns that she's had one killed, she said.",
      "The decision \"underscores that the traditional freedom of columnists to select the topics they wish to address and say what they think has been dangerously eroded,\" she wrote. Her resignation letter was first reported by The New York Times.",
      "A Post spokesperson said Monday that \"we're grateful for Ruth's significant contributions to The Washington Post over the past 40 years. We respect her decision to leave and wish her the best.\"",
      "While Bezos and Lewis have the right to make such decisions \u2014 they're the bosses \u2014 \"that has not been the tradition,\" Farhi said. He likened it to how the Justice Department, while technically under White House control, has generally operated independently. Editorial writers and columnists, paid to give their opinions, usually decide what to write, he said.",
      "The danger is that a decision by the publisher not to allow a column to go forward can make readers question whether the viewpoints of writers are truly their own, he said. Worse yet, it could taint the news department, which by most accounts is aggressively covering the new administration.",
      "Shortly after the editorial page decision was announced nearly two weeks ago, another Post story on the issue, by media columnist Erik Wemple, was scrapped, according to the Gene Pool, a blog written by former Post writer Gene Weingarten. Wemple declined comment on Monday.",
      "In January, editorial cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned after her work depicting Bezos and other billionaires genuflecting before a statue of President Donald Trump was rejected, a decision Shipley explained at the time was because it was repetitive of other opinion pieces.",
      "Under executive editor Matt Murray, the Post has also said it would refrain from having its journalists write about issues involving the newspaper, a decision Wemple said in a chat with readers in January that \"I couldn't possibly dissent (from) more strongly.\"",
      "The Post's opinion section on Monday included an editorial opposing Mexico's $10 billion lawsuit against firearms manufacturers, a case before the U.S. Supreme Court. Columnists Max Boot wrote about Trump and Russia, Perry Bacon Jr. about Democratic resistance to Trump centering in the states, Phillip Bump on whether Trump would pay a political price for unpopular policies and Jim Geraghty about violence in Syria.",
      "The Post, which made money during the first Trump administration, has been losing money in recent years and its internal strife largely began last June, when Sally Buzbee resigned as executive editor rather than accept a newsroom reorganization. Several prominent Post journalists \u2014 among them Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey, Philip Rucker, Matea Gold, Jackie Alemany, Michael Scherer and Will Sommer \u2014 have left for other jobs.",
      "Bezos' decision last fall that the Post would not endorse a presidential candidate \u2014 after the editorial staff had prepared to support Democrat Kamala Harris \u2014 led to an exodus of subscribers that the newspaper is fighting to recover from.",
      "Marty Baron, the Post's executive editor when Bezos bought the paper in 2013, wrote last week in the Atlantic that Bezos \"handled his ownership admirably for more than a decade. But his courage failed him when he needed it the most.\"",
      "Marcus' resignation on Monday overshadowed a newsroom reorganization plan introduced by Murray, including separating workflows for the Post's digital and print products.",

      "Discussion Questions",
      "1. Amy Griffin spent much of her adult life determined to move forward, never letting herself stop to look back. What do you think eventually motivated her to want to revisit her past and then to tell her story? Talk about the courage it takes to confront one's past\u2014and to share it with the world. Have you ever decided to divulge something about yourself that you once felt was impossible to share?",
      "2. Amy was a star student in her small Texas town, and she became a high-achieving businesswoman after arriving in New York. Talk about ambition as a trauma response. Do you think Amy believed she could outwork (and outrun) her past? How can \"The Tell\" serve as a reminder that people who appear to \"have it all\" are not always as they seem?",
      "3. A physical therapist tells Amy: \"There's something your body is telling you that you don't want to hear.\" How did her body's message manifest? What messages has your body sent you over the years? What makes it hard for you to listen to the messages your body sends?",
      "4. John supports Amy's decision to try therapy with Olivia and he works to keep the family's life afloat at home while she takes time to process what she's uncovered. But John also understands his own limits, telling Amy when she needs to find outside support so he can just be her husband. How does he know when to place this boundary? How does Amy react to this? Have you ever had to place a difficult boundary to preserve a relationship?",
      "5. Would you try psychedelic-assisted therapy? Why or why not?",
      "6. \"I needed to find the evidence that would confirm my memories,\" Amy writes in her journal. Why do you think Amy needs others to confirm what she knows to be true?",
      "7. What did you learn from \"The Tell\" and from Amy's sessions with Lauren about how memory works? Consider the distinction between memory storage and memory recall, for instance. What did you find most surprising?",
      "8. \"My daughters were asking me to participate in life, and in our relationship, in a way that I could not.\" How do Amy's children both trigger her memories\u2014and help her heal?",
      "9. For years, Amy remembers so many details around the abuse, but not the abuse itself. She saw clues, but not the full picture of her trauma. How did \"The Tell\" make you consider\u2014or reconsider\u2014your own life events and memories? Is there anything you might be unable or unwilling to remember? Have you ever surprised yourself by \"unlocking\" an unexpected memory?",
      "10. Amy begins to feel that justice will bring her closure. How was Paul's story both a helpful\u2014and unfortunately rare\u2014example for Amy? How does it affect her when she realizes her own story might not have such a tidy or satisfying outcome?",
      "11. What was it like for her to tell her parents? Have you ever had to have a difficult conversation with your parents about your childhood? What did you learn through that conversation\u2014about yourself or about them?",
      "12. Amy was raised in a traditional patriarchal Texas culture. Children were expected to both respect and obey their elders. How do the environments of our childhoods\u2014and the cultures in which we are raised\u2014inform our adult choices? How can our backgrounds influence what we can and cannot face in our personal histories?",
      "13. Amy recognizes the resources and time she was able to devote to both her healing and pursuing her legal case. How are situations of abuse and survival different for those without the same resources? In what ways might financial and class privileges insulate you from pain, or not?",
      "14. At the beginning of her journey, Amy can't \"tell\" her secret to herself. By the end, she's realized \"the telling is the medicine.\" How does telling her story help Amy heal?",
      "15. How does Amy give herself the closure she needs?",
      "16. Who do you think wrote the postcard? Does the writer's identity matter?",
      "17. What was your biggest takeaway from \"The Tell\"?",

      "The true part: the real person this actor is playing, Juan de Marcos Gonzalez, had already located and brought together the old musicians before music producers Ry Cooder and Nick Gold showed up in Havana. When their plan to make an album pairing Cuban and West African performers fell through, they went with Plan B, and recorded with the group Juan de Marcos had assembled.",
      "\"I was so happy, because they were my idols,\" Juan said. \"You know, I grew up with, you know, listening to their music. And then suddenly, I was the bandleader.\"",
      "I asked, \"Did any of the people involved, including you, have any idea that what became 'Buena Vista Social Club' would be something big?\"",
      "\"No,\" he replied. \"They became pop stars. It was like an unbelievable thing.\"",
      "The unexpected and irresistible phenomenon that resulted is the subject of the Oscar-nominated 1999 Wim Wenders documentary.",
      "\"It was just ubiquitous; I mean, you would hear this music everywhere,\" said music journalist and Substack contributor Judy Cantor-Navas, the author of \"Cuba on Record.\" \"To say that, 'Yes, we're listening to this old Cuban music that is suddenly selling millions of albums,' seemed like something that was very unlikely.\"",
      "I asked, \"Why do you think people loved the music so much?\"",
      "\"Cuban music has really appealed to so many different kinds of people,\" said Cantor-Navas. \"They say that it has, you know, the perfect combination of the Afro-Cuban rhythms and the Spanish melodies that came together in Cuba. It's just this very infectious music that, like, gets in your soul.\"",
      "It wasn't just the music they loved. It was who the musicians were \u2013 the improbable last act of their careers. The album won a Grammy, and has sold more than 8 million copies worldwide.",
      "\"And they were so happy, you know, because they came back to the stage,\" said Juan de Marcos. \"Because if you are a musician, and you are an artist, you are always an artist, you know? And even when you're retired, you have this small candle in your heart.\"",
      "Singer-dancer Omara Portuondo was 67; singer Ibrahim Ferrer was 70. Other band members were as old as 90. They began touring the world, even singing to me for a \"Sunday Morning\" story 25 years ago. \"I still have to pinch myself to make sure I'm not asleep and dreaming,\" Ferrer said then. \"I never thought I'd have so much success.\"",
      "From the archives: Buena Vista Social Club on its U.S. tour (2000)",
      "The play tells the imagined origin story of the musicians, their careers, and their personal struggles, with hints of romance, decades before their fame late in life.",
      "Marco Ramirez wrote the Broadway show. \"I'm Cuban American. I was born and raised in Miami, but my parents and my family's Cuban,\" he said. \"And so, for me what brought me to this was the music. It was music that I was raised around my entire life.",
      "He was 14 when the album came out: \"This was a moment of intense pride, of us realizing that the world cared about our music, and that these songs that I was used to hearing on my grandfather's little yellow Sony boom box above the washing machine, these were songs that suddenly the whole world cared about. That meant everything to me.\"",
      "Saheem Ali, the director of the show, grew up in Kenya. His father, an airline pilot, brought the album home. He became obsessed with it. \"I kept listening to it on repeat,\" he said. \"Something about the lyrics spoke to me. I learned the lyrics without knowing what I was talking about, 'cause Swahili's my first language.",
      "\"I knew nothing about their stories, absolutely nothing. The first time I knew about the stories was reading Marco's script. That's what excited me about this musical. People are gonna know about them now in a way that young people like me never had a chance to.\"",
      "Brought to life on a Broadway stage, the old songs as they were played in the 1940s and '50s at the actual Buena Vista Social Club, a members-only Havana nightclub for working class Black Cubans. It was shut down after Fidel Castro came to power in 1959. The events of the Cuban Revolution lurk at the edges of the show.",
      "Playing yesterday's Cuban music on Broadway are some of today's finest Cuban musicians, most of whom now live outside Cuba, because making a living there is tough.",
      "Juan de Marcos said, \"The people going to see the real Cuba, they are going to get a piece of our country when they attend the musical. We have nothing in our country. We don't have oil, we don't have gold, but we have the music, beautiful ladies, good coffee, the best cigars, and the best rum. And the music, which is the most important thing, like food for us.\"",

      "Dylan Mulvaney\u00a0burst onto the scene as a TikTok star, but what made her most famous was controversy. The trans influencer and performer was targeted after appearing in a campaign for Bud Light in 2023.",
      "In her new memoir, \"Paper Doll: Notes from a Late Bloomer,\" Mulvaney shares journal entries documenting the first year of her gender transition.",
      "\"I think of the book as like a quarter life crisis. But at the end of the day, I think it has a lot more heart than social media ever can have,\" Mulvaney said.",
      "Her TikTok series \"Days of Girlhood\" became a viral sensation, attracting more than one billion views. As her profile grew, the 28-year-old became a regular on red carpets.",
      "Mulvaney said she knew her gender identity from an early age.",
      "\"I knew I was a girl. That was one of the purest thoughts and intentions I've ever had throughout my entire life was to be brought into this world and to, so clearly, know who I was, and then to be told otherwise, is very conflicting,\" she said.",
      "She first came out as gay at 14, but it took another decade to embrace her identity as a trans woman.",
      "\"I settled into the identity as gay because that was all I saw around me,\" she explained.",
      "In 2023, Mulvaney joined celebrities partnering with Bud Light for a social media campaign. Her content was singled out by conservatives, leading to widespread backlash and\u00a0boycotts. Bud Light's parent company, Anheuser-Busch, saw its revenue fall by more than 10% after the campaign was released.",
      "\"It took a lot to not feel guilty about that experience because I felt like it was my fault. And that me taking this one brand deal was affecting trans people globally,\" Mulvaney said. \"I think extremists and transphobic media needed a poster child, but I would've never done anything or taken any deal that I thought could negatively impact me or the community.\"",
      "The experience affected her mental health, she said.",
      "\"It resulted in a lot of suicidal ideation and dissociation,\" Mulvaney said. \"I'm still battling with some of that guilt and that shame, and that dysphoria that was projected onto me during that time.\"",
      "Her new book comes amid renewed debate over transgender rights in the U.S. Last month, a group of transgender people filed a lawsuit challenging President Trump's executive order that halted gender marker changes on passports.",
      "For Mulvaney, the executive order doesn't change how she feels.",
      "\"I'm a woman no matter what my passport says. We are not hurting anyone,\" she said. \"We're less than 1% of the population. And the way that they speak about us so often is as if we're taking over cities like Godzilla.\"",
      "\"I am now realizing that this is life or death for a lot of people,\" she added. \"I want every trans person in this country to have the opportunity to thrive. And unfortunately, we're living in a time where it is very hard to do so.\"",

      "John Mulaney is a comedy superstar finding the funny in the familiar.\u00a0 At 42, he already has five highly-rated specials to his name \u2026 three primetime Emmys \u2026 and a reputation as one of the best stand-up guys in the game.",
      "\"Now, I don't know if you've been following the news but I've been keeping my ears open, and it seems like everyone everywhere is super-mad about everything all the time.\"",
      "But for his new job, the stand-up is sitting down. Mulaney is hosting a talk show on Netflix, complete with a couch and celebrity guests. And the whole thing is live, in part because he likes it better that way. \"It feels like there's more at stake,\" he said. \"I love that. It's the best.\"",
      "I asked, \"Explain that feeling \u2013 it's like coming up against a cliff and kind of dangling over it?\"",
      "\"No,\" he replied. \"It's dangling over it all the time.\"",
      "It began as an experiment during the Netflix Comedy Festival last year, called \"Everybody's in L.A.,\" talking about \"L.A. things,\" like earthquakes and coyotes. Now the show is back with a broader focus, and a new name, \"Everybody's Live With John Mulaney.\" It will go live every Wednesday night, starting this week. \"It's a fun feeling to know that hopefully a lot of people are watching,\" he said, \"and it's live, globally, with no delays, and you could really damage your career!\"",
      "To watch a teaser for \"Everybody's Live With John Mulaney,\" click on the video player below:",
      "And he knows all about live TV. For Mulaney, \"Saturday Night Live\" is home turf. He started as a writer there in 2008, and helped create some of the show's biggest characters, like Bill Hader's Stefon. Mulaney would often change the script at the last second to throw Hader off, like during this Halloween skit:",
      "Stefon: \"Have you heard of Blacula, the Black Dracula? Well, they have a Jewish Dracula.\"Seth Meyers: \"Oh, what's his name?\"Stefon: \"Sidney Applebaum!\"",
      "Seems like this was the thing John Mulaney was born to do. Raised in Chicago, Mulaney says he grew up feeling that comedy was his destiny. Asked if he has a memory of when he realized that he was funny, Mulaney said, \"Always interesting in these things, 'cause you don't want to sound egotistical, but I don't remember a time when I didn't think I was funny.\"",
      "Not long after graduating from Georgetown, he joined \"SNL,\" and a career was launched. He made his mark in New York, but he's fascinated with Southern California, where he now lives year-round.",
      "He took us record shopping at one of his favorite places, the legendary Amoeba Music in Hollywood.",
      "I asked, \"When you come out to places like this, do people come up to you? Or do they leave you alone?\"",
      "\"A little bit,\" he said. \"My joke is that I'm like Louis Farrakhan: I mean a lot to a small group of people.\"",
      "Truth is, Mulaney is a lot bigger than he'll admit. In his most recent special, \"Baby J,\" he played to a sold-out crowd and focused on his drug addiction, and recovery. He describes a 2020 intervention on his behalf staged by friends like Seth Meyers and Fred Armisen: \"Let me just call this out now, I don't mean to be weird, it was a star-studded intervention.\"",
      "It's funny now, of course: Mulaney says he's been clean for more than four years.",
      "Asked if sobriety is something he thinks about every day, Mulaney replied, \"Well, that's a good question. I don't think about cocaine, opioids, and benzodiazeprine every day. I'll acknowledge that I understand the vigilance I need. I do not think about it every day. I just don't. I do think about the ways that I can lead my life to perhaps never feel the kind of strain that got me there. So, yeah, sobriety maybe being, like, a bigger term than just abstaining from the chemicals, I definitely think about it every day.\"",
      "Mulaney credits his wife, actress Olivia Munn, with helping him navigate his recovery. You might remember her from Aaron Sorkin's \"The Newsroom,\" or \"X-Men: Apocalypse,\" in which she played Psylocke. But she's a bit of a superhero in real life as well; she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2023, and has shared her whole journey online, from the initial test to a double mastectomy. Other women have since credited her with saving their lives.",
      "Mulaney said, \"There's this lifetime risk assessment test that is really the only reason her cancer was discovered. And seeing so many women publicly and privately come to her that [say] they discovered how high their risk was from that, it's astonishing.\"",
      "She's also mom to their two young children, Malcom and Mei. \"I have this feeling a lot of times, I go, 'I can't believe I know this person, let alone am married to her,'\" he said.",
      "Fatherhood has given him not only new material, but also a whole new outlook on life.",
      "From his November 2024 monologue on \"Saturday Night Live\":",
      "\"My wife and I just welcomed a baby girl into our family. \u2026 My wife takes care of the five-week-old, and I take the two-year-old out. And that's not fair. That's not an equal distribution of labor at all. Saying, 'You have a five-week-old, I'll take a two-year-old,' that's like saying, 'I'll transport this convict across state lines. You hold a potato.'\"",
      "John Mulaney has made a good life making people laugh. Now, as a husband and father of two, he says he has something to live for.",
      "Asked how fatherhood has changed how he looks at the world, Mulaney replied, \"I'm in the world now that I'm a father. My head was my only home before that. When my son was born, the first thought I had was, I went, 'Oh, there you are.' And when my daughter was born, I had this \u2013 not to sound 'woo-woo' or anything \u2013 but when she was born, I went, 'Oh!' My thought was like, 'Oh, we've met before.

    "summary": "In the world of alpine skiing, few have been more decorated. Fast, fearless and resilient, Lindsey Vonn fought her way back after every crash, until she retired at 34. But now, with a titanium knee replacement, she is eyeing one more trip to the Olympics.",
    "story": [
      "For Lindsey Vonn, it was a reluctant farewell \u2013 the last run of her stellar career, at the Alpine World Ski Championships in Are, Sweden, in 2019. In the world of alpine skiing, few have been more decorated. She's won almost every major title, from World Cup Championships to Olympic medals, as the trophy case in her home proves.",
      "She says when she's racing, she doesn't think about the achievements: \"I think you just have a different perspective. You're focused on the next one, racing and performance, and you never really get to look back and say, 'Hey, good job,' you know?\"",
      "She was fast, reaching speeds of up to 85 mph. She was also fearless, and resilient. Crash after terrible crash, she always fought her way back. But 2013 was one of her hardest seasons. Vonn's right knee bore the brunt of a crash in the World Cup Super-G, and it was never the same. Flash forward almost six years, on the day of her last race \u2013 bum knee and all \u2013 she still managed to take home the bronze.",
      "At 34, Lindsey Vonn was retired.",
      "\"Skiing was always my sun, and everything in my life revolved around it: What time I woke up, what I ate, when I went to bed. It was all dictated around what's best for my skiing career,\" she said. \"And then, I woke up one day and my sun is gone.\"",
      "Ski racing is all Vonn ever wanted. Her dad, a former alpine skier himself, moved the family from Minnesota to Vail, Colorado, just so that Lindsey could train for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. Those same slopes she now sees from her home in Park City, Utah.",
      "\"This is kind of just where I go to, you know, re-group and recharge my batteries,\" she said. \"And the dogs love it.\"",
      "In retirement, Vonn has kept many of her corporate sponsors, which helped her buy homes in Miami and Beverly Hills. She continued to wow red carpets, and not racing gave her more time to pour into her foundation, helping under-served girls achieve their own athletic dreams.",
      "But that knee kept getting worse. \"I just couldn't do the things I love to do anymore,\" she said. \"It was really bad. I couldn't straighten it all the way. I couldn't flex it all the way. And so, I was just stuck in this half-state that ended up causing hip pain, back pain, neck pain. It wasn't just my knee, unfortunately. It was kind of everything. It's like you get to the end of your rope and you gotta make a decision. So, I did.\"",
      "A knee replacement \u2013 the outer portion of her right knee is now titanium.",
      "But she didn't do it just to get back into skiing. \"I don't need to ski,\" she said. \"I am Lindsey. I am not a skier; I'm a person that loves to ski. And that's a really big distinction for me, in my mind, in my heart.\"",
      "I asked, \"How soon afterwards did you wonder how far you could push it?\"",
      "\"It was pretty quickly after!\" she laughed.",
      "Only four months, in fact. She took her coaches to New Zealand to acquaint her new knee with her old sport. \"It just was such a drastic difference that I thought, well, if I can do all of these things that used to hurt me before, where would that take me? And my mind starts to wander, and here we are.\"",
      "And where she is, is back on the U.S. ski team, hoping to qualify for one more trip to the Olympics: Italy 2026.",
      "\"I will be at a disadvantage,\" Vonn said. \"I am 40, and at that time next year I will be 41. But I know my skiing is there. I think I'm actually skiing better now than I was last few years of my career.\"",
      "She admits there has been some good-natured ribbing: \"For sure. There's one girl that calls me Grandma, which I don't exactly appreciate! But there's definitely some jokes around the team that, you know, I raced in my first Olympics before one of the girls was born.\"",
      "She knew there would be some raised eyebrows, but she got more than that, with some critics going so far as to question her sanity. \"These past few weeks have been tough,\" she posted on Instagram last month. \"I know they are only a few voices out of many\u2026 But it still hurts.\"",
      "A post shared by L I N D S E Y  \u2022  V O N N (@lindseyvonn)",
      "She told us, \"What I didn't expect was people to criticize me as a person and why I'm doing it, and that I can't handle life outside of ski racing.\"",
      "She dismisses most of it, choosing to concentrate on training smarter, not harder. \"It's not like I'm preparing for another ten years of my skiing career,\" she said. \"I'm just preparing for one year, for literally two races.\"",
      "She's put the rest of her life on hold for the moment \u2013 a single goal does require a singularity of focus, much like making her banana bread does. And there's a purpose to that: \"I need to put on weight, man,\" she said. \"I'm about 20 pounds less than when I was racing before.\"",
      "That brand of determination, she says, came from her mom, Lindy Lund. \"She would have given anything to play tennis, to play squash, to ride a bike, and she couldn't,\" Vonn said.",
      "Her mom suffered a stroke while pregnant with Lindsey in 1984. It was debilitating, but she soldiered on without complaint. When she was diagnosed with ALS (once known as Lou Gehrig's Disease), she \u2013 like her daughter \u2013 wasn't about to give up. \"She thought that she could beat the odds, and she could be the one that would live 20 more years, and she lasted one,\" Vonn said. \"Man, it was hard. I still got her number in my phone. I still message her.\"",
      "She said her mom would want her to be flying high once again, even though winning another downhill will be an uphill battle. In a sport measured in hundredths of a second, the difference between first and last can be miniscule. But on this second go-around, Lindsey Vonn is taking time to savor the view just as much as the chase.",
      "\"The fact that I'm even talking about going to the Olympics right now is something I never thought I would ever do,\" she said. \"So, I'm already winning!\"",

      "Daffodils",
      "Sprouting in beautiful shades of yellow, orange, peach, white, cream, and even pink, daffodils\u2014known by their botanical name Narcissus\u2014are an early sign that spring has sprung.",
      "Some tried-and-true cultivars are the 'Golden Ducat', 'Rip Van Winkle', and 'Petit Four'\u2014all examples of the double daffodil, featuring one or more flowers to a stem. Another common variety is the trumpet daffodil, which has a center that is as long or longer than its petals. Large-cupped daffodils are defined by their prominent cups, while small-cup iterations have short cups that are less than one-third the length of the petals.",
      "Don't worry about recognizing all the different varieties; just choose what you like from your local garden center or online resource. Because no matter the type, daffodils (and other small bulbs) are so rewarding. The blooms last for two or three weeks in the garden and bring such color to your landscape. They are also low maintenance.",
      "Here are some tips to help you make the most of these perennial crowd-pleasers.",
      "Daffodils are winter-hardy in zones 3 through 8 and will return to bloom again year after year so long as they are planted in full or partial sun and in any soil that's not soggy.If your goal is to have drifts of daffodils, include varieties recommended for naturalizing and forming carpets on lawns and into woodlands. That way, the 100 bulbs you plant this fall will gradually multiply to 300, then 600, then 1,000, and so on.When planting en masse, it helps to create a planting \"map\" in advance on paper that can be transferred onto the ground with granular lime, as Martha does (see photo).Daffodil bulbs should be planted about two to three times as deep as the bulbs are high, so if you have one that's 2 inches tall, plant it 4 to 6 inches below the top of the soil.When harvesting for arrangements, grasp the stem at the base and pull rather than cutting, as viruses in bulbs can be passed along to other plants when using pruners to trim stems.Don't cut back daffodils too soon. Once the flowers bloom and fade, allow the whole plant to die back to the ground to create food for the bulbs so they can multiply.After removing spent foliage, apply a balanced 10-10-10 fertilizer over the entire area, and then add a layer of mulch. Fertilize the area again in the fall.",

      "It is nowhere you chose to be, and yet here you are. Papa steers your shoulders into the heart of the jack drive. Hundreds of rabbits stare at you through the wire around the fence posts. It feels like looking into the mirror. They do not want to be in this story either. Men have been working since dawn to herd the wild jacks into this pen. The town has gathered to solve the problem of the rabbits, who chew through rangeland and cropland, who eat the golden wheat your papa turns into money. Worse than the locusts, says Papa. Every hide brings a penny bounty. So many turnipy sweating bodies and a festive feeling in the air like a penny rubbed between two fingers, like blood shocked into a socket. A smell that reminds you of the room where babies are born. When you try to turn and run away, Papa grabs you. There's Mr. O'Malley, Mr. Waldowko, Mr. Zalewski, Mrs. Haage. You can't remember any more names. A hundred jointed arms come swinging into the pen that is alive with jackrabbits, the place of no escape. Now there is only madness. Terror of cudgels, terror of ax handles and hammers, terror of being trampled. \"Papa! Help! Stop!\" Rabbits run over your feet. \"Settle down, Harp\u2014\u00ad \" Papa is angry. He pours your name over your head like scalding water. The rabbits are angry. The rabbits are crying and dying, the clubs coming down, down, down. \"If you ain't gonna help, stay clear of us, boy\u2014\u00ad \" You are six today. Your family will have a party after supper. The cake was cooling when you left for town. You feel sick thinking about it. Cherries come slopping out of the rabbits. Gray skins are splitting, slipping under bootheels and wooden bats. Papa shows you what to target: the skulls and the spines of the screaming jacks. It's the fastest way to stop their screaming. There is another way, a voice cries out inside you. Smash it flat. You watch Papa click into his rhythm and begin to kill alongside the rest of the men.",
      "You meet your baby sister's gaze through the fan of her clean fingers. Lada is sitting on your mother's lap. Three girls you know are watching from outside the fence. The girls are allowed to squeal and shield their faces. You wish you were a girl with them. Down, down, down come the clubs and the planks. Your stomach bulges and flattens. You are screaming with the rabbits. Your birthday wish is to get to the end of this sound. Quiet comes at last. The men's arms rest against their sides like tools in a shed. Women are hanging the dead jacks to dry by their long ears. Every twitching rabbit's foot has stilled. Inside of you, the screaming continues. It goes on and on and on. Papa finds you where you have hidden your eyes behind your hands, your tears inside your palms. \"We can't let the jacks overrun the whole prairie. No one likes it, Son.\" This is a lie. Many had liked it. You shut your eyes along with the dead rabbits, because you did not want to see whose faces were smiling.",
      "\"Here,\" says Papa. \"One is still living. You cannot be softhearted, Harp.\"",
      "Your father puts the club in your hands. And after that, you are always afraid.",

      "Washington \u2014 The White House is withdrawing former Florida Rep. Dave Weldon's nomination to be the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a White House official confirmed Thursday.",
      "An administration official who was asked about why Weldon's nomination was withdrawn responded, \"It was clear he did not have the votes in the Senate.\"",
      "Weldon, a vaccine critic, was set to appear before the Senate's health committee on Thursday for his confirmation hearing, and news of the withdrawal of his nomination came less than an hour before the hearing was to begin. Axios first reported news of Weldon's nomination being pulled.",
      "The committee was expected to question him about his long record of criticizing vaccines and the agency he was nominated to lead. Weldon is a physician and a former Republican member of Congress.",
      "In a statement obtained by CBS News, Weldon said that Health and Human Services Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u00a0was \"very upset\" at his nomination being pulled. Weldon said he had received a call from the White House 12 hours before the scheduled hearing, informing him that the nomination would be withdrawn.",
      "\"Bobby Kennedy is a good man who really is passionate about improving the health of the American people,\" Weldon said. \"President Trump did a good thing in making him secretary of HHS.  Hopefully they can find someone for CDC who can survive the confirmation process and get past pharma and find some answers.\"",
      "Weldon said that Maine Sen. Susan Collins had told Kennedy she had reservations about his nomination and said the Republican senator's staff had been \"very hostile\" in a meeting with him.",
      "Collins' staff repeatedly accused him of being against vaccines, Weldon said, \"even though I reminded them that I actually give hundreds of vaccines every year in my medical practice.\"",
      "Speaking with reporters Thursday, Collins said Weldon's withdrawal came as a surprise to her and that she had planned to give him a chance to respond at the hearing.",
      "\"I did not express concerns to the White House. I had some reservations, but I certainly had not reached a final judgment,\" Collins said.",
      "Multiple people familiar with Weldon's Senate meetings said Republicans had been concerned over his answers when asked about his priorities for the agency. Weldon wanted to detail his priorities for the CDC after being confirmed and learning more about the agency as director.",
      "Weldon was unfamiliar with the CDC's current budget and workforce, telling congressional staffers he was busy with his medical practice and did not want to waste time reading up on an agency he might not be confirmed to lead, they said.",
      "Two people said Collins' staff had only asked Weldon how he would address the perception that he was against vaccines, but denied accusing him of being \"anti-vaccine.\"",
      "Weldon said that over 20 years ago, while in Congress, he raised concerns about childhood vaccine safety, and \"for some reason Collins staff suddenly couldn't get over that.\"",
      "He also claimed that another senator, Louisiana Republican Dr. Bill Cassidy, had also said he was anti-vaccine and had once asked for his nomination to be withdrawn.",
      "A spokesperson for Cassidy denied that he had asked the White House for Weldon's nomination to be withdrawn. Cassidy had been \"looking forward\" to Thursday's hearing with Weldon, the spokesperson said.",
      "The CDC has faced mounting questions from senators in recent weeks over moves to reopen studies into whether vaccines are linked to autism and also over an abruptly canceled meeting of the agency's outside immunization advisers, which has yet to be rescheduled.",
      "Kennedy has also faced criticism this week for inflating the risks of measles vaccines when discussing the\u00a0record outbreak\u00a0in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. Kennedy, whose department oversees the CDC, also has a history of\u00a0criticizing vaccines.",
      "After a meeting with Sen. Patty Murray last month, the Washington Democrat said she was \"deeply disturbed to hear Dr. Weldon repeat debunked claims about vaccines.\"",
      "\"As we face one of the worst measles outbreaks in years thanks to President Trump, a vaccine skeptic who spent years spreading lies about safe and proven vaccines should never have even been under consideration to lead the foremost agency charged with protecting public health,\" Murray said in a statement Thursday.",
      "Weldon would have been the first CDC director nominee to face Senate confirmation, after a change passed by Congress in 2022. Previous picks to head the Atlanta-based public health agency were able to assume their posts without the Senate's votes.",

    "summary": "President Trump has imposed steep tariffs on Canadian goods, citing trade imbalances and drug trafficking. But many of his claims exaggerate or misrepresent the facts.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has made a number of inaccurate claims about Canada in the past week as he imposed new tariff hikes on the country and touted his plans for more.",
      "On Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump imposed a blanket 25% tariff on foreign steel and aluminum, significantly impacting Canada, the largest foreign supplier of these metals to the U.S. An additional 25% tariff on most Canadian goods is set to go into effect on April 2.",
      "Experts warn these hikes could lead to increases in consumer prices, but Mr. Trump has justified them in part by saying he's protecting American manufacturers and incentivizing Canada to crack down on drug crime.",
      "However, in interviews and social media posts, Mr. Trump has exaggerated the size of the U.S.trade deficit with Canada and the amount of fentanyl coming over the northern border. The president also misrepresented Canada's tariffs on U.S. dairy and lumber products.",
      "Here's a breakdown of some of these claims:",
      "Trump's misleading claim that Canada has tariffs above 200% on U.S. dairy products",
      "President Trump said March 7: \"In Canada, we find that they're charging us over 200% for dairy products\u2026 And when I left, we had that well taken care of, but under Biden they just kept raising it.\"",
      "Details: President Trump has suggested Canada unfairly put tariffs of over 200% on American dairy products during President Biden's term, but the level has been unchanged since before Biden took office.",
      "The over 200% tariffs on U.S. dairy products are only triggered if U.S. dairy exports exceed certain yearly duty-free limits, and U.S. dairy manufacturers say they have never been close to exceeding these limits.",
      "Additionally, these tariffs were negotiated during the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which Mr. Trump signed during his first term. Canada's published tariff lists for 2020 and 2025 show tariffs on U.S. dairy products have remained unchanged from the end of his first term through the end of President Biden's term. For example, both lists show the same tariff rate of 245.5% for any cheese products above the duty-free limit.",
      "Canadian Ambassador to the U.S. Kirsten Hillman told told CBS News the dairy tariffs are in place to \"protect our farmers and families.\" Canada is the second-largest importer of U.S. dairy, purchasing about $1.1 billion worth in 2024.",
      "The U.S. sold roughly double the amount of dairy to Canada as Canada sold to the U.S. last year, according to trade data from the U.S. Census Bureau.",
      "Trump's misleading claim that Canada has a \"tremendously high tariff\" on lumber while the U.S. charges \"a tiny fraction of that\"",
      "President Trump said March 7: \"They have a tremendously high tariff, give you the exact numbers in a little while coming out, on lumber. So, they sell us lumber, they have a tremendous tariff. They make it impossible for us to sell lumber or dairy products into Canada, but our numbers are a tiny fraction of that, almost non-existent.\"",
      "Details: On March 4, Canada imposed a tariff of 25% on softwood lumber from the U.S., a rate that is high compared to recent history.",
      "But Mr. Trump did not mention these tariffs are part of Canada's response to the 25% levies on most Canadian goods, including lumber, that the Trump administration initially announced in early March, which are now expected to take effect on April 2.",
      "Before this trade escalation, Canada had imposed zero tariffs on U.S. softwood lumber for years, according to Dustin Jalbert, a senior economist at Fastmarkets who covers wood products.",
      "\"It's certainly true that right now there are tariffs in place, but that was not the case before the kickoff of the trade war. These are retaliatory to what the U.S. instigated, if you will, in early March,\" Jalbert said.",
      "The U.S. had previously placed duties on imported softwood lumber, with tariffs on Canadian lumber rising from 8% to 14.5% in 2024.",
      "Trump's false claim that the U.S. has a $200 billion trade deficit with Canada",
      "President Trump\u00a0said\u00a0March 13:\u00a0\"In the case of Canada, we're spending $200 billion a year to subsidize Canada.\"\u00a0And on Feb. 26 he said: \"The tariffs will make it impossible for them to sell lumber or anything else into the United States. And all I'm asking to do is break even or lose a little bit, but not lose $200 billion.\"",
      "Details: Mr. Trump has repeatedly exaggerated the U.S.-Canada trade deficit, claiming it's as large as $200 billion.",
      "In fact, the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services with Canada in 2024 was closer to $35.7 billion, according to the latest trade data released from the U.S. Census Bureau on March 6.\u00a0 That trade deficit narrowed from $40.6 billion in 2023.",
      "For goods alone, the U.S. bought $70.6 billion more in goods from Canada than it sold in 2024, down from $72.3 billion in 2023.",
      "The overwhelming driver of the deficit with Canada is that the U.S. buys a lot of unrefined oil from the country, according to Julian Karaguesian, a lecturer at the department of economics at McGill University.",
      "\"A lot of Canadian economists say if you take out energy, Canada is running a small deficit with the United States,\" Karaguesian said.",
      "Trump's misleading claim that large amounts of fentanyl come from Canada",
      "President Trump said in his address to Congress\u00a0March 4: \"Much has been said over the last three months about Mexico and Canada, but we have very large deficits with both of them. But even more importantly, they have allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens.\"",
      "Details: Mr. Trump has cited Canada's failure to halt the flow of illicit drugs as a reason for imposing tariffs, saying that fentanyl has been coming from the country \"at levels never seen before.\" He claimed, \"The fentanyl coming through Canada is massive.\"",
      "However, Mr. Trump overstates the amount of fentanyl coming across the northern border. In 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the U.S.-Canada border, accounting for roughly 0.2% of all fentanyl seized by CBP that year. By contrast, approximately 21,100 pounds \u2014 about 96.6% of the total \u2014 was seized at the southern border.",

Led by billionaire Elon Musk, DOGE has\u00a0abruptly terminated thousands of federal workers\u00a0over the last three weeks, causing turmoil across multiple departments.",
      "The deadline for SSA workers to accept the \"voluntary separation incentive payments\"\u00a0is Saturday, March 14. Those who opt in must leave the agency by April 19.",
      "Last month, the agency said it aims to cut the size of its workforce by 7,000 people, focusing on workers and jobs that don't \"provide mission critical services.\"",
      "Former SSA Commissioner Martin O'Malley, who led the agency under the Biden administration from December 2023 to November 2024, expects the actual number to be closer to 10,000 workers. The agency currently employs roughly 57,000 people.",
      "\"Everybody who can is going to take that early out, but I think that 7,000 number is conservative,\" O'Malley said Thursday at a panel discussion on recent changes at the agency and how they could affect customer service, held by the National Academy of Social Insurance (NASI), a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization.",
      "\"They are all going to take it,\" he said, adding that employees who choose to stay, will risk losing their jobs without a bonus.",
      "\"They are communicating to people if you don't take the cash and get out now, you are taking the chance of being fired and playing the game of Russian Roulette that follows,\" said O'Malley, who believes the changes being implemented at the agency will \"cause a total system collapse of social security.\"",
      "The amount of the SSA incentive payments being offered individual workers depends on the employee's classification, or where they stand on the federal payscale. The highest-tier worker would receive a maximum of $25,000.",
      "O'Malley is also concerned that offering to buy workers out in the name of efficiency amounts to the \"greatest amount of waste in operational history by paying people not to work.\"",
      "Security vunerabilities",

      "\"We should be petrified about privacy and the theft of data,\" he said at the NASI panel discussion.",
      "In the past, attempts made by adversaries to access proprietary information \"have been consistently thwarted\" with staff in place to safeguard data, Astrue noted. \"It is a daunting thing to imagine what a foreign power might do with broad access to this kind of data.\"",

      "\"Reimposing these debilitating tariffs at a time when the spirits industry continues to face a slowdown in U.S. marketplace will further curtail growth and negatively impact distillers and farmers in states across the country,\" Swonger said in a statement. \"We urge the U.S. and EU governments to come to a resolution that gets our spirits industry back to zero-for-zero tariffs.\"",
      "According to the Distilled Spirits Council, a retaliatory tariff imposed in 2018 during Mr. Trump's first term, caused exports of U.S.-made whiskey to drop 20%. But over the last three years, exports to the EU grew nearly 60% from $439 million in 2021 to $699 million in 2024, the trade group said.",
      "Since returning to the White House for a second term, Mr. Trump has made tariffs a key area of his economic agenda, though the levies have sparked concerns of a recession and roiled the stock market.

Beijing imposed retaliatory measures that went into force Monday that target U.S. farmers with levies of 15% on chicken, wheat and corn, and 10% on soybeans, pork, beef and fruit.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture is cutting two federal programs that provided about $1 billion in funding to schools and food banks to buy food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers, part of what the agency said was a decision to \"return to long-term, fiscally responsible initiatives.\"",
      "The move cancels about $660 million in funding this year for the Local Food for Schools program, which is active in 40 U.S. states, as well as about $420 million for a second program called the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement, which helps food banks and other local groups provide food to their communities.",

      "The decision comes as the Trump administration and Elon Musk's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, say they are slashing federal spending to reduce government waste. The USDA programs were funded through the agency's Commodity Credit Corporation, a Depression-era fund created to buy products directly from farmers.",
      "\"Unlike the Biden Administration, which funneled billions in [Commodity Credit Corporation] funds into short-term programs with no plan for longevity, USDA is prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact,\" a USDA spokesperson said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In recent days, schools were alerted that they were set to lose $660 million in federal funding for the current year, according to Diane Pratt-Heavner, director of media relations for the School Nutrition Association, which represents thousands of school meal employees. The withdrawal of funding will affect schools across the U.S. at a time when they're already grappling with high food costs, she said.",
      "\"It's a pretty big hit\"",
      "One of those school districts said the USDA's decision will wipe out $100,000 in funding that it had planned to spend on local beef and produce for students' school meals.",
      "\"It's a pretty big hit, and that's mostly fresh fruits and vegetables,\" said Patti Bilbrey, director of nutrition services at the Scottsdale Unified School District in Arizona. \"It wasn't just about keeping food costs low \u2014 it meant supporting your community and your local farmers in your state.\"",
      "While the $100,000 represents about 2% of the school district's roughly $6 million in annual spending on food, Bilbrey noted that it allowed the district to buy food ffrom small farmers and introduce produce like microgreens to their students. She added that the funding loss comes as her district, like many others, are struggling to keep school meals affordable amid rising food and labor costs.",
      "The Local Food for Schools program \"was a godsend to us,\" Bilbrey said. \"It keeps our meal costs down, and we're helping our community, which improves the perception of school meals.\"",

      "The Amazon trial had been scheduled to start in September. The FTC is seeking to relax some of the deadlines in the case and a delay akin to a two-month continuance. The agency does not want to \"move the trial back more than a couple of months,\" Cohen said.",

      "The Consumer Price Index was forecast to rise 2.9% last month, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in those prices over time.",
      "February's data comes after inflation accelerated in January, when it rose 3% on an annual basis.",
      "What economists say",
      "The report shows \"further signs of progress on underlying inflation, with the pace of price increases moderating after January's strong release,\" said Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions in Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "Despite the lower-than-expected inflation, the Federal Reserve is still likely to hold off on cutting rates at its March 19 meeting, Haigh noted. \"[The] combination of easing inflationary pressures and rising downside risks to growth suggest that the Fed is moving closer to continuing its easing cycle,\" Haigh said.",
      "Grocery prices are continuing to rise, with groceries increasing 2.6% in February from a year earlier, the CPI report said. The ongoing rise of food costs is creating a financial pinch for many households, economists note.",
      "Egg prices were a driver of last month's grocery inflation, with the cost of eggs jumping 58.8% from a year earlier, the report said. Coffee rose 6% on an annual basis, while restaurant meals jumped 3.7% from a year ago.",
      "Food inflation has been \"gradually accelerating since mid-2024, reaching almost 5% on a 3-month annualized basis\" in January, according to Morgan Stanley economists in a March 6 research note.",
      "Other items that saw price hikes in February include car insurance, which rose 11.1% on an annual basis, and medical care, which rose 3% from a year ago. Meanwhile, President Trump's tariff barrage has the potential to boost prices for many products, from food imports to automobiles, adding to an uncertain outlook for inflation, economists say.",

      "What it means for your money",
      "Even though the inflation data came in lighter than expected, price increases are still pacing well above the Fed's 2% annual goal. Because of that, economists say it's unlikely the Fed will cut rates at its meeting next week.",

      "Sweeping 25% tariffs on all U.S. steel and aluminum imports\u00a0could cause prices on a range of consumers foods, including cars and washing machines, to rise. Components used in manufacturing and for construction such as nails, could also become more expensive.",
      "Anything that's made with metal, from homes and cars to canned foods and beverages could soon get a new and higher price tag.",
      "\"All manufacturing that uses steel or aluminum, or uses something that uses steel and aluminum will be affected,\" international trade expert Christine McDaniel, senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Dr. Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow and director at the Pacific Research Institute, a right-leaning think tank, called the forthcoming tariff impact \"a barn burner,\" leading to higher prices and an economic slowdown.",
      "He added that all \"broad-based core commodities\" are vulnerable to price hikes as a result of the levies. In addition to automobiles and electronics, which rely heavily on metals, that includes less obvious goods like canned goods, whose prices could rise if packaging costs jump.",
      "\"We are going to see it in places you don't expect it,\" Winegarden said.",
      "American consumers likely to see higher prices on cars and more",
      "Car, truck, bus and tractor parts were the largest import category by volume last year, that will be covered under the tariffs, according to the United States International Trade Commission.",
      "American Automotive Policy Council, which represents Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, said the new tariffs \"will add significant costs for automakers, suppliers and consumers\" in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Inevitably, some of those added costs will be passed along to consumers.",
      "\"It is not easy for American companies that use steel and aluminum in production to find it elsewhere, so we'll see increases in prices. Makers of vehicles will face higher costs, which will be passed on to consumers,\" Layna Mosley, politics and international affairs professor at Princeton School of Public and International Affairs, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Metal parts on doors, window frames and other hardware used in the construction of housing will also be subject to the levies, leading to growing costs for homebuilders.",
      "Jim Tobin, CEO of the National Association of Home Builders, pointed to estimates showing that the metal tariffs could add up to $10,000 to the cost of a home, although he noted it is likely to take months for the impact to become clear. \"Those costs are going to be passed on to the ultimate homeowner or renter,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Machine parts, including steel wires, screws and more are also likely to be hit, raising the price of a broad range of appliances from dishwashers and dryers to garbage disposals and air conditioners.",
      "\"Just look around the house. Anything that has steel or aluminum in it will be exposed to tariffs,\" McDaniel said.",
      "Gym and sports equipment will also be tariffed, though manufacturers may have stockpiled some materials in anticipation of the tariffs going into effect, enabling them to head off price hikes for a short period, Mosley noted.",
      "Higher price for aluminum cans",
      "In addition to automakers, construction projects and possibly defense contractors, the tariffs would also increase costs to \"food processing and packaging including can manufacturers,\" Satyam Panday, chief economist, U.S. and Canada, S&P Global Ratings, said in a recent report.",
      "Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said in an earnings call last month said that the company imports aluminum for its cans, and that if tariffs make them more expensive, it could start selling more beverages in plastic bottles.",
      "\"As it relates to our strategies around ensuring affordability and ensuring consumer demand, if one package suffers some increase in input costs, we continue to have other packaging offerings that will allow us to compete in the affordability space,\" Quincey said. \"For example, if aluminum cans become more expensive, we can put more emphasis on PET [plastic] bottles, et cetera.\"",
      "\"Tariffs and non-tariff barriers tend to disproportionately burden the small and midsize businesses,\" added Panday. \"Profits are likely to be squeezed at the margin. To the extent businesses can pass on the rising cost, consumers would also eventually see their prices increase. Overall, pressure on inflation would rise just as markets and consumers are appearing to be sensitive to inflationary expectations.\"",
      "For Brooklyn-based brewery Talea, the tariffs on aluminum, which the company uses for its beer cans, could lead to higher operating costs, co-founder LeAnn Darland recently told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady. Darland said she hopes to share any increased costs with suppliers, because she's not sure consumers will be willing to swallow any price hikes.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Mar 2025 12:31:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Consumers, businesses and investors are increasingly jittery about the risks of a protracted slump. So what exactly is a recession?",
    "story": [
      "President Trump sparked concerns this week when he declined to rule out the possibility of a U.S. recession this year. Asked on Fox news if he expects such a slump, Mr. Trump said, \"I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big.\"",
      "U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also seemed to leave open the possibility of a downturn, telling CBS News in an interview on Tuesday that Mr. Trump's economic policies are \"worth it\" even if they lead to a recession.",
      "While it is notoriously hard to predict a recession, there are definitive criteria that must be met in order for a business cycle to be considered recessionary. Here's what to know.",
      "What is a recession, and who decides if we're in one?",
      "A recession is generally defined as a broad-based, persistent decline in economic activity. The more popular metric is that a recession is two straight quarters of negative economic growth, although in fact there's more to it than.",
      "Recessions are identified by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a non-profit, nonpartisan research group that dates U.S. business cycles. To determine if the economy has entered a recession, NBER evaluates six key indicators: real personal income; non-farm payroll employment; employment as measured by the household survey; personal consumption; manufacturing and trade sales; and industrial production.",
      "More specifically, NBER looks at the depth of the changes in these indicators, how broadly a slump is affecting different industries and how long a downturn lasts. The upshot: In a recession, the decline in economic activity must be significant, sustained and widespread, rather than limited to a particular sector.",
      "Could the U.S. tumble into a recession anytime soon?",
      "For now, economic data suggest that's unlikely. Although layoffs around the country are rising, the U.S. labor market continues to create jobs at a decent clip. Despite economic growth slowing, it's not expected to fall off a cliff. In fact, Julia Pollack, chief economist at career site ZipRecruiter, notes that four of the six signals tracked by the NBER point to continued economic expansion.",
      "\"Right now, things feel uncomfortable given the significant amount of policy uncertainty, the federal layoffs, and we've seen business, consumer and investor sentiment fray,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So to some it feels like the economy is in a recession, but we are not there yet.\"",
      "Still, cracks are appearing that could portend a sharper downturn down the road. Retail spending, which is the lifeblood of the economy, is\u00a0waning, while measures of consumer confidence show a\u00a0sharp deterioration of late. Investor concerns about the Trump administration's barrage of tariffs on other nations has also slammed stock prices, which could further pressure spending.",
      "\"Negative consumption is concerning because consumer spending is backbone of U.S. economy,\" Pollack said. \"And it's not just that spending fell. Sentiment has fallen, household budgets are squeezed and consumers are more vulnerable to shocks, which has heightened recession fears.\"",
      "Sweet added, \"Right now, your traditional causes of a recession aren't flashing red, but we just have this suffocating effect of all the uncertainty around trade and fiscal policy and immigration.\"",
      "Lutnick, the Commerce Department chief, defends Mr. Trump's economic policies, saying they will boost economic activity.",
      "\"The only reason there could possibly be a recession is because the Biden nonsense that we had to live with. These policies produce revenues. They produce growth. They produce factories being built here,\" he told CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "What signals would point to a recession?",
      "The clearest sign would be a steady increase in job losses and a jump unemployment. In a recession, consumers pare spending and businesses pull back on investment. That typically leads to a slowdown in hiring and rise in layoffs.",
      "The nation's unemployment rate did tick up last month, to 4.1% from 4%, though that is still quite low. But employers added 151,000 jobs, a sign that businesses are still seeking to hire workers and enough payroll gains to keep unemployment in check.",
      "Many economists monitor the number of people who seek unemployment benefits each week, a gauge that indicates whether layoffs are worsening. Weekly jobless claims\u00a0remain low.",
      "Who is most vulnerable in a recession?",
      "Most Americans would feel the impact of a recession in one way or another, for weaker hiring to tepid wage gains. Among people who are employed, those who entered the labor market last tend to be the first to lose their job in a recession, noted Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at the Groundwork Collective, a left-leaning economic think tank.",
      "\"So you see the people who are hardest to reach as we reach full employment are the first to get laid off. That includes lower wage workers, black workers, Latino workers. Those who have the hardest time getting a job when times are good are first to lose jobs when times are bad,\" he said.",
      "Americans who carry debt on their homes and can't make minimum payments also can face foreclosure in a downturn, locking a generation out of building household wealth.",
      "\"That's one reason why recessions are so damaging, because it's the least among us that get hurt the most when downturns come,\" Jacquez said.",

That's a bigger win than the tariffs themselves, but the tariffs are going to be throwing off a lot of money to this country.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Tuesday threatened to put tariffs of 50% on steel and aluminum from Canada, but reversed course and\u00a0chose to stay with the 25% rate after the province of Ontario suspended plans to put a surcharge on electricity sold to Michigan, Minnesota and New York.",
      "Trump tariffs history",
      "In many ways, the president is now addressing what he perceives as unfinished business from his first term. Mr. Trump meaningfully increased tariffs, but the revenues collected by the federal government were too small to significantly increase overall inflationary pressures.",
      "Mr. Trump's 2018 tariffs on steel and aluminum were eroded by exemptions. After Canada and Mexico agreed to his demand for a revamped North American trade deal in 2020, they avoided the import taxes on the metals. Other U.S. trading partners had import quotas supplant the tariffs. And the first Trump administration also allowed U.S. companies to request exemptions from the tariffs if, for instance, they couldn't find the steel they needed from domestic producers.",
      "While Mr. Trump's tariffs could help steel and aluminum plants in the U.S., they could raise prices for the manufacturers that use the metals as raw materials. Economists also say the gains to the steel and aluminum industries were more than offset by the cost they imposed on \"downstream'' manufacturers that use their products.",
      "At these downstream companies, production fell by nearly $3.5 billion because of the tariffs in 2021, a loss that exceeded the $2.3 billion uptick in production that year by aluminum producers and steelmakers, the U.S. International Trade Commission found in 2023.",
      "Mr. Trump sees the tariffs as leading to more domestic factories, and the White House has noted that Volvo, Volkswagen and Honda are all exploring an increase in their U.S. footprint. But the prospect of higher prices, fewer sales and lower profits might cause some companies to refrain from investing in new facilities.",

      "\"The 25 percent tariff on steel and aluminum with no exceptions or exemptions will go into effect for Canada and all of our other trading partners at midnight, March 12th,\" Desai said.",

In response, Ontario agreed to suspend its 25 per cent surcharge on exports of electricity to Michigan, New York and Minnesota.\"",
      "Moments after the Ford-Lutnick joint statement was issued, the president told reporters he's considering dialing back the 50% tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum imports he announced earlier, saying he's \"looking at it\" and could \"make a different decision.\"",
      "On Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump said he would double the levy on all steel and aluminum imports beginning Wednesday, citing Ontario's electricity surcharge as the reason for the price hike.",

      "The president also called on Canada to drop tariffs on various U.S. dairy products, and said he will be declaring a \"national emergency on electricity\" in the areas affected by Canada's electricity surcharge. New York, Minnesota and Michigan, which border Canada, were targeted by Ontario's surcharge.",
      "The president also reiterated his desire for Canada to become the United States' 51st state, a proposal Canadians oppose, suggesting the northern neighbor won't face tariff pressure if they acquiesce.",
      "\"The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished Fifty First State,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"This would make all Tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear. Canadians taxes will be very substantially reduced, they will be more secure, militarily and otherwise, than ever before, there would no longer be a Northern Border problem, and the greatest and most powerful nation in the World will be bigger, better and stronger than ever \u2014 And Canada will be a big part of that.\"",
      "Stocks\u00a0tumbled again\u00a0on Tuesday amid uncertainty over the president's tariffs regime and fears that the U.S. economy could slip into a recession.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Mar 2025 17:38:30 -0400",
    "summary": "If deciding what to do with an old 401(k) plan has been on your to-do list, here are the key steps you should take to get it done.",
    "story": [
      "Aging 401(k)s are a little like the old clothes in the back of your closet. You know you should do something about them, but there they sit, mostly out of sight and mind.",
      "And so it is with your old 401(k). If deciding what to do with an old 401(k) plan has been on your to-do list for a while, here are the key steps you should take to get it done.",
      "Step 1: See how much you have saved",
      "If your balance in your former employer's 401(k) plan is over $7,000, you can leave the money behind in the old plan or roll the assets into an IRA or your new employer's 401(k).",
      "But if your balance falls below that $7,000 threshold, some of the decision-making may be out of your hands.",
      "Step 2: Decide whether to roll the money or leave it alone",
      "Assuming your balance is over $7,000, your next task is to decide whether to roll the money into an IRA or keep it inside a 401(k).",
      "I often recommend rolling over the assets from a former 401(k) into a no-fee IRA with a topnotch mutual fund company or discount broker. But some people value the extra creditor protections that can accompany 401(k) assets versus IRA assets, while others may prize 401(k)-specific investment options.",
      "If you think you will be better off leaving your money inside a 401(k) rather than rolling it over to an IRA, the next job is to conduct some research on your own 401(k) options.",
      "Even if you do decide to stay with a 401(k), you may need to decide whether you're better off staying put in your former employer's plan or that of your new employer.",
      "Step 3: If rolling over into an IRA, find the right options",
      "If a rollover to an IRA is the way to go, the next step is to identify the right brokerage firm or mutual fund company. Look for a firm that offers a breadth of high-quality investment options with no additional layers of fees for IRA investors. Target-date funds are an elegant, low-maintenance, and underutilized option.",
      "If you decide to roll Roth 401(k) contributions to an IRA or your current employer's 401(k), your new account will be Roth, too, meaning that you won't owe tax on qualified withdrawals.",
      "If you have traditional 401(k) assets, a rollover is also a good time to consider whether to convert those assets to a Roth account at the same time.",
      "Step 4: Fill out the necessary paperwork",
      "If you've decided to roll over your assets to an IRA, fill out the paperwork or online form to open the IRA. You'll then request a direct rollover from your 401(k) plan to the new IRA provider.",
      "The process may be a bit more cumbersome if you're rolling over to your current employer's 401(k).",
      "In both cases, make sure your 401(k) provider makes the check payable to the provider and sends it directly to them, rather than to you. If the check is made out to you, 20% of the balance will be withheld for income tax. You'll then have 60 days to get that money deposited into an IRA or another 401(k); if that deadline comes and goes, the distribution will count as a withdrawal and you'll owe ordinary income tax and a 10% early withdrawal penalty if you're not 55 or older.",
      "If you've decided to roll over your assets from an old 401(k) to another 401(k) or IRA, you'll also have to determine how you'll allocate those assets.",
      "If all of your retirement assets were in your old 401(k), a sturdy target-date fund is a one-stop, low-maintenance choice that you can hold into retirement. If your old 401(k) is just one of several accounts geared toward retirement, a rollover can be an ideal time to check up on how all the pieces fit together\u2014and where you have holes.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Mar 2025 17:24:16 -0400",
    "summary": "The policy could lead to hardship for some elderly Americans, Social Security advocates say. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Getting overpaid by Social Security will soon come at a high cost, with the agency saying Friday it's reinstating a plan to take 100% of a beneficiary's monthly check to claw back the money, up from the current 10% rate.",
      "The policy change highlights an issue that had caused financial hardship for some beneficiaries in years past, prompting the Social Security Administration under the Biden administration to limit clawbacks to 10% of a person's monthly benefit check.",
      "But the Trump administration's reversal could lead to deep financial strain for some senior citizens who find themselves caught up in the overpayment issue. While overpayments are rare, they are often the result of Social Security's own miscalculations \u2014 and can come as a surprise to beneficiaries, given that it can be difficult to know if you have been overpaid.",
      "\"People generally do not know they are overpaid \u2014 you were receiving benefits, assuming that the government was giving you the proper amount,\" Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, an advocacy group for the benefit, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"People are really desperate when they get a letter from the government saying, 'You owe $10,000' that they don't have.\"",
      "The Social Security Administration didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "How many people get overpayments from Social Security?",
      "Fewer than 1% of the Social Security Administration's payments are what the agency terms as \"improper,\" which can include both over- and underpayments, according to a 2024 report from its inspector general. As the report noted, while it's a small share of the overall $1.6 trillion in benefits paid each year, it still adds up to billions of dollars.",
      "From fiscal year 2015 to 2022, the Social Security Agency paid about $72 billion in improper payments, most of which were overpayments, the report noted. That represents 0.84% of total Social Security payments during that time.",
      "How do overpayments occur?",
      "The agency says that they are usually due to two issues:",
      "Beneficiaries don't update their earnings data or alert the agency to other changesSocial Security employees don't update beneficiaries' records in a timely way",
      "Beneficiaries don't update their earnings data or alert the agency to other changes",
      "Social Security employees don't update beneficiaries' records in a timely way",
      "Sometimes beneficiaries may not understand that they need to update the agency with new information, partly due to the complexity of the Social Security system, which has more than 20,000 pages of rules, the inspector general said in its 2024 report.",
      "And sometimes SSA employees, who must in some cases manually calculate complex benefits, also make mistakes, the report added.",
      "However, there are cases where seniors receive \"strategic overpayments,\" said Ed Weir, a former Social Security manager who runs a YouTube channel about the benefit.",
      "In a recent webcast about the issue, Weir noted that sometimes seniors who are under the full retirement age but who are still working after having claimed Social Security aren't sure if they'll bump up against the earnings limit of $23,400. Under its rules, Social Security will hold back $1 in benefits for every $2 in earnings above that threshold.",
      "Some seniors decide, \"'I'll let it ride, because I won't know until November or December if I'm going over\" that limit, Weir said.",
      "But seniors who now opt for a \"strategic overpayment\" could end up losing one or two months of benefits due to the new clawback policy, Weir added.",
      "When will the new policy go into effect?",
      "The SSA said it will start claiming 100% of benefit checks to cover new cases of overpayments starting on March 27.",
      "The withholding rate for people who had been overpaid before March 27 will remain at 10%, as will the rate for overpayments for Supplemental Security Income, a program for low-income seniors and disabled Americans.",
      "What happens to Medicare if your Social Security check is clawed back?",
      "Medicare coverage could be another pitfall for seniors whose benefit checks are subject to the 100% clawback, experts said. That's because most seniors pay for their Medicare Part B premiums by having it automatically deducted from their Social Security monthly checks.",
      "The Social Security Administration didn't respond to requests for clarification about the issue.",
      "It's unclear if seniors would have to arrange to pay for their Medicare premiums through another payment system, or if the SSA would allow them to pay for their health care first before clawing back the remaining money, Altman of Social Security Works said.",
      "\"If you are on Medicare, it means you might not pay your Medicare possibly, so you might lose your Medicare,\" Weir said. \"It's a trickle down effect.\"",
      "What if the clawback causes financial hardship?",
      "Prior to the Biden reform to pare clawbacks to 10% of a person's benefit check, some Americans had encountered financial hardship after receiving shock bills amounting to\u00a0thousands of dollars. Some people were even driven into homelessness after their benefits were stripped away, KFF reported in 2023.",
      "Beneficiaries have the right to request a waiver of overpayment recovery through\u00a0SSA form 632, Weir noted.",
      "\"Two things have to be met for the payment to be waived: No. 1, it's not your fault, and No. 2, you don't have the ability to pay,\" he said.",
      "You can also appeal the overpayment, in case you think the overpayment amount is incorrect or you disagree that you were overpaid, through SSA form 561.",
      "Lastly, you can also request a different payment amount if you can't meet your living expenses due to the repayments, the SSA says.",
      "\"With Social Security, if you disagree with the decision, appeal it,\" Weir said on his webcast. \"Always appeal everything.\"",

    "story": [
      "A columnist who has worked at The Washington Post for four decades resigned on Monday after she said the newspaper's management decided not to run her commentary critical of owner Jeff Bezos' new editorial policy.",
      "\"It breaks my heart to conclude that I must leave,\" Ruth Marcus, who has\u00a0worked\u00a0at the newspaper since 1984, wrote in a resignation letter.",
      "Her exit is the latest fallout from the billionaire owner's directive that the Post narrow the topics covered by its opinion section to personal liberties and the free market. The newspaper's opinions editor, David Shipley, had already resigned because of the shift.",
      "The storied newspaper has been in a free fall, financially and editorially, over the past year. Marcus, who worked in the news and opinion departments during her career, is \"the bedrock of The Washington Post, embodying the history of the place as well as the talent and accomplishments of its journalists,\" said Paul Farhi, a former media reporter there.",
      "Marcus, who was a finalist for the\u00a0Pulitzer Prize for Commentary\u00a0in 2007, said that the Post's publisher, Will Lewis, declined to run her column, which she described as \"respectfully dissenting\" from Bezos' edict. It was the first time in nearly 20 years of writing columns that she's had one killed, she said.",
      "The decision \"underscores that the traditional freedom of columnists to select the topics they wish to address and say what they think has been dangerously eroded,\" she wrote. Her resignation letter was first reported by The New York Times.",
      "A Post spokesperson said Monday that \"we're grateful for Ruth's significant contributions to The Washington Post over the past 40 years. We respect her decision to leave and wish her the best.\"",
      "While Bezos and Lewis have the right to make such decisions \u2014 they're the bosses \u2014 \"that has not been the tradition,\" Farhi said. He likened it to how the Justice Department, while technically under White House control, has generally operated independently. Editorial writers and columnists, paid to give their opinions, usually decide what to write, he said.",
      "The danger is that a decision by the publisher not to allow a column to go forward can make readers question whether the viewpoints of writers are truly their own, he said. Worse yet, it could taint the news department, which by most accounts is aggressively covering the new administration.",
      "Shortly after the editorial page decision was announced nearly two weeks ago, another Post story on the issue, by media columnist Erik Wemple, was scrapped, according to the Gene Pool, a blog written by former Post writer Gene Weingarten. Wemple declined comment on Monday.",
      "In January, editorial cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned after her work depicting Bezos and other billionaires genuflecting before a statue of President Donald Trump was rejected, a decision Shipley explained at the time was because it was repetitive of other opinion pieces.",
      "Under executive editor Matt Murray, the Post has also said it would refrain from having its journalists write about issues involving the newspaper, a decision Wemple said in a chat with readers in January that \"I couldn't possibly dissent (from) more strongly.\"",
      "The Post's opinion section on Monday included an editorial opposing Mexico's $10 billion lawsuit against firearms manufacturers, a case before the U.S. Supreme Court. Columnists Max Boot wrote about Trump and Russia, Perry Bacon Jr. about Democratic resistance to Trump centering in the states, Phillip Bump on whether Trump would pay a political price for unpopular policies and Jim Geraghty about violence in Syria.",
      "The Post, which made money during the first Trump administration, has been losing money in recent years and its internal strife largely began last June, when Sally Buzbee resigned as executive editor rather than accept a newsroom reorganization. Several prominent Post journalists \u2014 among them Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey, Philip Rucker, Matea Gold, Jackie Alemany, Michael Scherer and Will Sommer \u2014 have left for other jobs.",
      "Bezos' decision last fall that the Post would not endorse a presidential candidate \u2014 after the editorial staff had prepared to support Democrat Kamala Harris \u2014 led to an exodus of subscribers that the newspaper is fighting to recover from.",
      "Marty Baron, the Post's executive editor when Bezos bought the paper in 2013, wrote last week in the Atlantic that Bezos \"handled his ownership admirably for more than a decade. But his courage failed him when he needed it the most.\"",
      "Marcus' resignation on Monday overshadowed a newsroom reorganization plan introduced by Murray, including separating workflows for the Post's digital and print products.",

The manufacturer and multiple airlines said the issue does not constitute an immediate safety issue.",
      "\"Regular maintenance checks are scheduled to ensure it is captured early and the right corrective actions are put in place in a timely manner to mitigate the situation,\" an Airbus spokeswoman told CBS News in a statement. \"The A220 fleet's airworthiness remains intact.\"",
      "Sources familiar with the problem said the corrosion has been found on some passenger seat fittings and certain wing components, including what's known as the wing-to-body fairing, which is designed to minimize drag where the wing and body of the plane meet. It essentially acts as an aerodynamic cover over that junction and is not structural in nature.",
      "\"The FAA is aware of the issue and is ensuring airlines address it,\" an agency spokesman confirmed to CBS News in a brief statement.",
      "Delta Air Lines, the world's largest A220 operator, told CBS News it has observed the issue with some passenger seat fittings that require additional inspection and lubrication.",
      "The Atlanta-based carrier said the issue is not impacting scheduled A220 flights and has not resulted in cancellations.",
      "\"Delta has a sophisticated aircraft maintenance apparatus that is always-on and has many layers to ensure that every aircraft in our fleet is safe to fly by meeting or exceeding standards governed by our regulators,\" a company spokesman told CBS News. \"There is broad consensus by our technical experts that these issues aren't surprising especially for a new, clean-sheet aircraft and pose no major concerns.\"",
      "The airline said while it is aware some A220 carriers may be finding corrosion in the wing-to-body fairing structure, so far Delta mechanics have not found it on their fleet.",
      "JetBlue and Breeze Airways also fly dozens of A220s along with a host of international carriers, including Air Canada, Air France and Swiss Air.",
      "\"We are aware that some areas of the A220 have experienced corrosion and are proactively taking measures to mitigate these concerns,\" a Breeze spokesman told CBS News. \"The safety of our Guests is our first priority, which is why Breeze performs regular maintenance inspections on all of its aircraft to ensure airworthiness.\"",
      "And a JetBlue spokesperson told CBS News, \"All JetBlue aircraft are regularly inspected and maintained to ensure their safety and reliability. JetBlue is working closely with Airbus to proactively address corrosion on certain areas of some A220 aircraft. This does not impact the reliability of our A220 fleet.\"",
      "The A220 was subject to a 2021 airworthiness directive to address corrosion and wear in wing components known as slat tracks that were likely caused by insufficient grease being applied to the component during production. The directive called for additional inspections to monitor the amount of grease applied to the slat tracks.",
      "Sources told CBS News the new issues go beyond the focus of that 2021 order from Transport Canada.",
      "The plane was originally developed by Bombardier as the C-series before being sold to Airbus due to financial headwinds facing Bombardier. The plane is built in Quebec and Mobile, Alabama.",
      "The A220 seats between 100 and 150 passengers with five-seat rows. It's seen as a replacement for larger regional jets like the Embraer 190 and aging Boeing 717 jets.",
      "Because the plane was developed in Canada, it was initially certified by regulators there. The FAA and European Union Aviation Safety Agency validated the certification but would not typically be the lead agency on an issue like this.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Mar 2025 09:24:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Southwest Airlines is ending its free checked bags policy for many passengers. Some experts think customer loyalty could suffer.",
    "story": [
      "Southwest Airlines boasts that its passengers' \"bags fly free\" \u2014 but not for long.",
      "Starting May 28 \u2014 just in time for the busy summer travel season \u2014 only Southwest's most elite Rapid Rewards A-List Preferred members and passengers who book their top-tier Business Select fares will receive two free checked bags. Frequent flyer A-List Members, Southwest-branded credit card holders and other select customers will be allowed one checked bag.",
      "Everyone else will be charged for their first and second checked bags on flights booked on or after May 28, the carrier says.",
      "\"Just another airline\"?",
      "It's a break with Southwest's 54 year history \u2014 one that could undermine customer loyalty to the carrier, according to experts.",
      "\"This is how you destroy a brand. This is how you destroy customer preference. This is how you destroy loyalty. And this, I think, is going to send Southwest into a financial tailspin,\" airline industry analyst Henry Harteveldt, of Atmosphere Research Group, told CBS News senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave. \"Southwest, with these changes, becomes just another airline.\"",
      "Just last September, Southwest CEO Bob Jordan told Van Cleave bags would continue to fly without charge.",
      "\"Bags will still fly free,\" Jordan said. \"It's the third thing customers look for after fare and schedule: Bags fly free, on us. Ninety-seven percent are people who are aware of our policies. So it's a huge consumer advantage. So bags will absolutely fly free.\"",
      "But when pressed if they'd always fly free, he acknowledged, \"Well, never say never. \u2026 It's like saying open seating would never change 20 years ago. Consumer preferences change, but from everything that we see, there's no reason to reconsider this at all, especially right now.\"",
      "\"When 97% of your customers say they fly you because of your 'bags fly free' policy and you make dramatic changes to it, you are telling almost all of your customers, 'Your business doesn't matter to us anymore,'\" Harteveldt said. \"We are watching an airline self-destruct. This is the equivalent of deliberately sailing a ship into an iceberg.\"",
      "The cost of a checked bag hasn't been announced but airline sources say it will be competitive with other carriers.",
      "In comments at a JPMorgan Chase online event, United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said Tuesday that Southwest's baggage policy shift is like \"the slaying of a sacred cow,\" while adding that it could boost the discount carrier's profit margins.",
      "\"I view it as a big deal because it feels more a financially driven, results driven airline than it's ever been before,\" he said.",
      "Delta President Glen Hauenstein, who also spoke at the JPMorgan conference, added that he thinks some Southwest customers could now be \"up for grabs\" because of its move away from free bags.",
      "Mounting financial pressure",
      "The move comes as Southwest, the nation's fourth-largest airline, has been under intense pressure from an activist investor to improve its financial performance after struggling to keep pace with changing customer preferences post-pandemic.",
      "Southwest recently announced its first ever layoffs, launched its first redeye flights, and intends to end its long-running open seating policy next year. Instead, the airline will offer seat assignments and sell extra legroom seats for an additional fee.",
      "Also announced Tuesday are changes to Southwest's Rapid Rewards frequent flyer program \u2014 increasing the points flyers get for booking higher-priced Business Select fares while reducing the points earned on less expensive \"Wanna Get Away\" and \"Wanna Get Away Plus\" fares. The airline will also start dynamic or variable pricing for points redemption across higher and lower demand flights.",
      "What's more, starting May 28, Southwest will add a heavily discounted basic economy fare class that will guarantee a flyer a seat on a plane but will likely come with restrictions similar to other carriers' basic economy offerings.",
      "In a video statement Tuesday morning, Jordan said the changes \"will help us return to the levels of profitability we all expect, and to support our collective long term success. It's also about adapting to what our customers want.",
      "\"Many things have changed post-Covid: the loss of short-haul demand, a rise in premium demand, and a change in customer preferences.\"",
      "Jordan said the goal is to secure Southwest's future.",
      "\"We are more than the logo on our planes,\" he said. \"Our DNA isn't open seating, or even bags fly free. It's a dedication to service.\"",
      "Harteveldt says, \"More choice is always a good thing. More low fares are always a good thing. And Southwest is large enough that if they use their basic economy fares in the right way, and I believe they will, they may force other airlines to be more aggressive in their pricing.\"",
      "Southwest is the last major U.S. airline to offer a basic economy product, which carriers launched to compete with ultra-low cost airlines like Frontier and Spirit.",
      "While the offerings vary by airline, basic economy tickets often come without an advance seat assignment, tend to be in the last boarding group and may limit the number or size of carry-on luggage. Checked bags and other perks come with a cost. It's been a hit for airlines. United Airlines reported basic economy revenue jumped 20% last year.",
      "\"Southwest Airlines remains committed to its core tenets \u2014 amazing people who deliver great hospitality to all Southwest customers, a strong network with the most nonstop flights within the U.S., and a loyalty program that gives real value to Rapid Rewards Members,\" the carrier said in a statement.",
      "But is that the Southwest that people know?",
      "\"Yes,\" Harteveldt said. \"This change is just so unlike Southwest. And it really is something that I worry could be far more financially damaging to the airline than helpful.\"",

    "summary": "The president threatened to take retaliatory action in response to EU tariffs on U.S.-made whiskey.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday threatened to impose tariffs on wines, Champagnes and other alcoholic products imported to the U.S. from France and other European countries in response to raised tariffs the European Union placed on American whiskey.",
      "In a post to Truth Social, the social media company the president owns, Mr. Trump said the U.S. will retaliate against the European Union after it announced Wednesday that it would be increasing tariffs on U.S.-made whiskey to 50%.",
      "\"If this tariff is not removed immediately, the U.S. will shortly place a 200% tariff on all wines, champagnes, & alcoholic products coming out of France and other E.U. represented countries,\" he wrote. \"This will be great for the wine and champagne businesses in the U.S.\"",
      "Mr. Trump accused the EU of being \"one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the world.\"",
      "Since returning to office, the president has threatened tariffs, and imposed the levies, on a host of major U.S. trading partners. On Wednesday, he increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25%, prompting retaliatory action from the EU.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement Wednesday that the countermeasures from the EU are worth 26 billion euros, or $28 billion. The tariffs, set to take effect April 1, target a range of U.S. exports, including beef, poultry, bourbon, jeans and peanut butter.",
      "\"We deeply regret this measure,\" von der Leyen said. \"Tariffs are taxes. They are bad for business, and worse for consumers. They are disrupting supply chains. They bring uncertainty for the economy. Jobs are at stake. Prices will go up.\"",
      "The U.S. exported $1.2 billion in wine and related products in 2024, including more than $167 million to the EU, according to the Department of Agriculture. It is the top importer of wine, bringing in nearly $4.9 billion worth in 2023. France and Italy were the top partners for importing both wine and Champagne into the U.S.",
      "Champagne is a sparkling wine from the Champagne region in northeast France. If it is made outside of that region, it is called sparkling wine.",
      "Chris Swonger, president and CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council, a trade group representing the U.S. spirits industry, called the EU's announcement to reimpose heightened tariffs on American whiskey \"deeply disappointing\"",
      "\"Reimposing these debilitating tariffs at a time when the spirits industry continues to face a slowdown in U.S. marketplace will further curtail growth and negatively impact distillers and farmers in states across the country,\" Swonger said in a statement. \"We urge the U.S. and EU governments to come to a resolution that gets our spirits industry back to zero-for-zero tariffs.\"",
      "According to the Distilled Spirits Council, a retaliatory tariff imposed in 2018 during Mr. Trump's first term, caused exports of U.S.-made whiskey to drop 20%. But over the last three years, exports to the EU grew nearly 60% from $439 million in 2021 to $699 million in 2024, the trade group said.",
      "Since returning to the White House for a second term, Mr. Trump has made tariffs a key area of his economic agenda, though the levies have sparked concerns of a recession and roiled the stock market. The president declined to rule out the possibility of an economic downturn, telling Fox News in an interview that aired Sunday that \"there is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big.\"",
      "In an interview with CBS News, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Tuesday that Mr. Trump's economic policies are \"the most important thing America has ever had\" when asked whether they would be worth it if they lead to a recession. \"It's worth it.\"",
      "Lutnick added, \"The only reason there could possibly be a recession is because the Biden nonsense that we had to live with. These policies produce revenues. They produce growth. They produce factories being built here.\"",
      "The president's trade war escalated this month with 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% tax on goods imported from China, taking effect last week. Beijing imposed retaliatory measures that went into force Monday that target U.S. farmers with levies of 15% on chicken, wheat and corn, and 10% on soybeans, pork, beef and fruit.",
      "The president, however, swiftly reversed course on the levies on imports from Mexico and Canada, pausing the tariffs covered under a 2020 trade deal negotiated during his first administration until April 2. That agreement, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, covers the majority of goods imported from Mexico. Those that are not subject to the deal, however, still face tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump has also exempted other products from his planned tariffs, including providing a one-month exemption to U.S. automakers that were bracing to be hit hard\u00a0by the levies on vehicle parts and components imported from Canada, Mexico and China.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he'll vote to keep the government open as the chamber prepares to take up a\u00a0GOP stopgap bill\u00a0continuing government funding Friday.",
      "\"I believe it is my job to make the best choice for the country, to minimize the harms to the American people,\" Schumer said. \"Therefore, I will vote to keep the government open, and not shut it down.\"",
      "His support for the measure signaled that Democrats would let the measure pass to prevent a shutdown as the caucus grappled Thursday with the uncomfortable choice.",
      "In a lengthy speech from the Senate floor, the New York Democrat outlined his opposition to the House-passed bill but went on to say that his bigger worry was about what failing to fund the government could bring. He warned that a government shutdown would give President Trump and his allies \"the keys to the city, state and country,\" arguing that \"while the CR bill is very bad, the potential for a shutdown has consequences for America that are much, much worse.\"",
      "The Senate plans to take up the House-passed bill to fund the government through September beginning on Friday. Republicans need 60 votes to invoke cloture and advance the measure, meaning it will need the support of Democrats to get to a vote on final passage. Speaking to reporters after his remarks, Schumer wouldn't say whether enough Democrats would support advancing the measure, noting that \"each is making his or her own decision.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Senate Democrats have been considering a plan to pave the way for a vote on final passage of the Republican-led bill in exchange for a doomed-to-fail vote on their own 30-day alternative. Schumer told reporters that the option remains their preference, but no agreement has been reached with Senate Republican leadership.",
      "With government funding set to expire on Friday night, Democrats have found themselves in the position of being able to block the GOP bill, but also wary of the government shutdown that would ensue if they do so. Democratic leaders have instead been pushing for a 30-day funding extension that would allow more time for negotiations on new spending bills \u2014 a nonstarter, given Republican control of the House and Senate.",
      "A possible solution began to emerge after Senate Democrats met on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. The plan would call for Democrats to provide the votes needed to advance the GOP bill in exchange for a vote on an amendment with their own one-month stopgap measure, which would almost certainly fail. Democrats who oppose the GOP version could then vote against its final passage. Some members see it as a way to save face while also avoiding a shutdown.",
      "\"I think we're going to all be 'no' on cloture unless we get an agreement to propose at least this 30-day clean [continuing resolution] amendment and maybe a couple of others,\" Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia told reporters Thursday. \"So we'll be 'no' on cloture unless we get an agreement to do that. I'm not aware of whether the Republicans have agreed to that yet, but we'll be 'no' on cloture if we don't get it, and I think that's a unified position.\"",
      "The House approved the six-month funding measure on Tuesday largely along party lines, sending the funding fight to the Senate.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters ahead of Schumer's remarks that his office has been in touch with the minority leader's staff, but Democrats haven't made a formal offer. Thune noted that if Democrats want a vote on the 30-day continuing resolution in exchange for helping Republicans reach the 60-vote threshold on the House-passed bill, \"they can get that.\"",
      "\"There's basically one path to keep the government from shutting down and one door to unlock, and Democrats have the keys,\" he said. Thune filed cloture on the House-passed measure Thursday night, setting up a Friday vote.",
      "Democrats emerged from Wednesday's meeting touting their alternate plan that would fund the government until April 11. Schumer warned Republicans that they do not have the votes to approve the House-passed stopgap measure, which increases defense spending and funding for veterans' health care, while decreasing non-defense spending below 2024 levels.",
      "Although efforts to fund the government usually find bipartisan support, Democrats widely oppose the measure and have expressed frustration with the spending reductions, while warning that it would give the Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency even more latitude to carry out cost-slashing efforts. The possibility of forcing a shutdown is one of the few points of leverage Democrats have as the minority in both chambers.",
      "But Democrats also fear the fallout of a lapse in funding, which could serve as the pretext for the Trump administration to make even deeper cuts across the federal workforce. Some Senate Democrats see the plan to vote for cloture but against final passage as a way to thread the needle, while others have argued that a vote on the short-term continuing resolution isn't for show.",
      "Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, said the approach isn't a gimmick, noting the bipartisan work that has been done so far on new funding bills that would go by the wayside with the House-passed funding extension.",
      "\"What would be an absolute crime is to support a House bill written only by Republicans,\" Merkley said, adding, \"You don't stop a bully by handing over your lunch money, and you don't stop a president like Trump from being authoritarian by proceeding to give in and give him more power again.\"",
      "Frustrations appeared to mount among Democrats throughout the day on Thursday, as they met again behind closed doors on the issue. Schumer told his caucus during the meeting that he planned to vote to advance the GOP funding measure, a source familiar confirmed to CBS News. As the meeting let out, a number of Democrats released statements on social media announcing that they would vote no on the House-passed continuing resolution, while they otherwise remained tight-lipped about their intentions.",
      "Meanwhile, some outspoken progressives have denounced the plan, saying the party is capitulating to the president and Republicans while getting nothing substantive in return.",
      "\"I hope Senate Democrats understand there is nothing clever about setting up a fake failed 30 day CR first to turn around & vote for cloture on the GOP spending bill,\" New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez posted on X on Thursday. \"Those games won't fool anyone. It won't trick voters, it won't trick House members. People will not forget it.\"",
      "Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, the sole Democrat who publicly said he would back the House-passed measure, likewise criticized the idea of exchanging support for cloture for a vote on the short-term continuing resolution.",

    "summary": "President Trump has imposed steep tariffs on Canadian goods, citing trade imbalances and drug trafficking. But many of his claims exaggerate or misrepresent the facts.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has made a number of inaccurate claims about Canada in the past week as he imposed new tariff hikes on the country and touted his plans for more.",
      "On Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump imposed a blanket 25% tariff on foreign steel and aluminum, significantly impacting Canada, the largest foreign supplier of these metals to the U.S. An additional 25% tariff on most Canadian goods is set to go into effect on April 2.",
      "Experts warn these hikes could lead to increases in consumer prices, but Mr. Trump has justified them in part by saying he's protecting American manufacturers and incentivizing Canada to crack down on drug crime.",
      "However, in interviews and social media posts, Mr. Trump has exaggerated the size of the U.S.trade deficit with Canada and the amount of fentanyl coming over the northern border. The president also misrepresented Canada's tariffs on U.S. dairy and lumber products.",
      "Here's a breakdown of some of these claims:",
      "Trump's misleading claim that Canada has tariffs above 200% on U.S. dairy products",
      "President Trump said March 7: \"In Canada, we find that they're charging us over 200% for dairy products\u2026 And when I left, we had that well taken care of, but under Biden they just kept raising it.\"",
      "Details: President Trump has suggested Canada unfairly put tariffs of over 200% on American dairy products during President Biden's term, but the level has been unchanged since before Biden took office.",
      "The over 200% tariffs on U.S. dairy products are only triggered if U.S. dairy exports exceed certain yearly duty-free limits, and U.S. dairy manufacturers say they have never been close to exceeding these limits.",
      "Additionally, these tariffs were negotiated during the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which Mr. Trump signed during his first term. Canada's published tariff lists for 2020 and 2025 show tariffs on U.S. dairy products have remained unchanged from the end of his first term through the end of President Biden's term. For example, both lists show the same tariff rate of 245.5% for any cheese products above the duty-free limit.",
      "Canadian Ambassador to the U.S. Kirsten Hillman told told CBS News the dairy tariffs are in place to \"protect our farmers and families.\" Canada is the second-largest importer of U.S. dairy, purchasing about $1.1 billion worth in 2024.",
      "The U.S. sold roughly double the amount of dairy to Canada as Canada sold to the U.S. last year, according to trade data from the U.S. Census Bureau.",
      "Trump's misleading claim that Canada has a \"tremendously high tariff\" on lumber while the U.S. charges \"a tiny fraction of that\"",
      "President Trump said March 7: \"They have a tremendously high tariff, give you the exact numbers in a little while coming out, on lumber. So, they sell us lumber, they have a tremendous tariff. They make it impossible for us to sell lumber or dairy products into Canada, but our numbers are a tiny fraction of that, almost non-existent.\"",
      "Details: On March 4, Canada imposed a tariff of 25% on softwood lumber from the U.S., a rate that is high compared to recent history.",
      "But Mr. Trump did not mention these tariffs are part of Canada's response to the 25% levies on most Canadian goods, including lumber, that the Trump administration initially announced in early March, which are now expected to take effect on April 2.",
      "Before this trade escalation, Canada had imposed zero tariffs on U.S. softwood lumber for years, according to Dustin Jalbert, a senior economist at Fastmarkets who covers wood products.",
      "\"It's certainly true that right now there are tariffs in place, but that was not the case before the kickoff of the trade war. These are retaliatory to what the U.S. instigated, if you will, in early March,\" Jalbert said.",
      "The U.S. had previously placed duties on imported softwood lumber, with tariffs on Canadian lumber rising from 8% to 14.5% in 2024.",
      "Trump's false claim that the U.S. has a $200 billion trade deficit with Canada",
      "President Trump\u00a0said\u00a0March 13:\u00a0\"In the case of Canada, we're spending $200 billion a year to subsidize Canada.\"\u00a0And on Feb. 26 he said: \"The tariffs will make it impossible for them to sell lumber or anything else into the United States. And all I'm asking to do is break even or lose a little bit, but not lose $200 billion.\"",
      "Details: Mr. Trump has repeatedly exaggerated the U.S.-Canada trade deficit, claiming it's as large as $200 billion.",
      "In fact, the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services with Canada in 2024 was closer to $35.7 billion, according to the latest trade data released from the U.S. Census Bureau on March 6.\u00a0 That trade deficit narrowed from $40.6 billion in 2023.",
      "For goods alone, the U.S. bought $70.6 billion more in goods from Canada than it sold in 2024, down from $72.3 billion in 2023.",
      "The overwhelming driver of the deficit with Canada is that the U.S. buys a lot of unrefined oil from the country, according to Julian Karaguesian, a lecturer at the department of economics at McGill University.",
      "\"A lot of Canadian economists say if you take out energy, Canada is running a small deficit with the United States,\" Karaguesian said.",
      "Trump's misleading claim that large amounts of fentanyl come from Canada",
      "President Trump said in his address to Congress\u00a0March 4: \"Much has been said over the last three months about Mexico and Canada, but we have very large deficits with both of them. But even more importantly, they have allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens.\"",
      "Details: Mr. Trump has cited Canada's failure to halt the flow of illicit drugs as a reason for imposing tariffs, saying that fentanyl has been coming from the country \"at levels never seen before.\" He claimed, \"The fentanyl coming through Canada is massive.\"",
      "However, Mr. Trump overstates the amount of fentanyl coming across the northern border. In 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the U.S.-Canada border, accounting for roughly 0.2% of all fentanyl seized by CBP that year. By contrast, approximately 21,100 pounds \u2014 about 96.6% of the total \u2014 was seized at the southern border.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judge-reinstatement-federal-agencies-probationary-employees/",
    "published": "Thu, 13 Mar 2025 19:49:34 -0400",
    "summary": "U.S. District Judge William Alsup extended relief to fired workers at the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Interior and Treasury.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in California ordered six federal agencies to reinstate probationary employees who were fired last month, finding that their terminations by the Office of Personnel Management were unlawful.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco handed down his order in a challenge brought by a group of unions against the Trump administration from the bench. He said that neither OPM nor its Acting Director Charles Ezell had the authority to direct the terminations across agencies.",
      "The order extends relief to fired workers at the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Interior and Treasury.",
      "\"It is a sad, sad day when our government would fire some good employee and say it was based on performance when they know good and well that's a lie,\" Alsup said at the end of a hearing on the unions' request for a preliminary injunction. \"That should not have been done in our country. It was a sham in order to avoid statutory requirements.\"",
      "The judge, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, noted that federal law allows for agencies to engage in a \"reduction-in-force,\" the government's name for mass layoffs, but doing so comes with several requirements.",
      "\"It can be done if it's in accordance with the law,\" he said. \"This case is not about that. What this case is about is really an attempt to do a reduction-in-force\" through OPM. He said that having OPM, the federal government's chief human resources agency, direct departments to fire probationary workers was an \"easy way to get a reduction-in-force underway\" and a \"gimmick.\"",
      "The judge also criticized President Trump's firing of former special counsel Hampton Dellinger and attempts to get rid of members of the Merit Systems Protection Board, which oversees the administrative appeals of federal workers challenging their firings. A federal judge in Washington ordered that Cathy Harris, a member of the MSPB removed by Mr. Trump, return to her role. The Trump administration has appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.",
      "Alsup said Mr. Trump's removals of Harris and Dellinger were likely part of efforts to \"decimate\" the MSPB and ensure \"these employees will have no recourse.\"",
      "Spokespeople for the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Interior declined to comment. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that a \"single judge is attempting to unconstitutionally seize the power of hiring and firing from the executive branch.\"",
      "\"The president has the authority to exercise the power of the entire executive branch \u2014 singular district court judges cannot abuse the power of the entire judiciary to thwart the president's agenda. If a federal district court judge would like executive powers, they can try and run for president themselves,\" she said. \"The Trump administration will immediately fight back against this absurd and unconstitutional order.\"",
      "The hearing",
      "The judge's order came at the end of a roughly two-hour-long hearing on the unions' request for a preliminary injunction. He repeatedly condemned the Trump administration's efforts to keep key officials, namely Ezell, from testifying in the early stages of the litigation.",
      "Ahead of the hearing, the Justice Department had withdrawn a declaration from Ezell. Lawyers for the unions said the move was part of an effort to keep him from having to answer their questions. In an order issued Monday, Alsup said that if Ezell failed to appear, the court \"will have to decide the sanction.\"",
      "The judge told Kelsey Helland, a Justice Department lawyer, that allowing the acting OPM head to be questioned by lawyers representing the unions \"will reveal the truth.\"",
      "Noting his decades on the bench, Alsup said, \"I know how we get at the truth, and you're not helping me.\" He accused the government of frustrating his ability to find out whether OPM directed agencies to fire probationary workers, or whether the agency heads acted on their own.",
      "But in the end, Alsup concluded that the human resources agency directed departments to get rid of the workers, with the exception of those considered \"mission critical.\" He rejected the Justice Department's attempts to argue that press releases announcing the terminations show the agency heads themselves were the decisionmakers.",
      "The Trump administration last month fired thousands of probationary employees, generally those who were in their roles for less than a year, as part of the president's efforts to shrink the size of the federal government.",
      "The notices informed the affected federal employees that they were being terminated for performance reasons. Shortly after, a group of unions representing government workers, the state of Washington and nonprofit organizations challenged the mass firings, arguing that OPM lacked the authority to order agencies to carry them out.",
      "Danielle Leonard, a lawyer for the unions, said during Thursday's hearing that the firings were not done at the discretion of each agency and argued OPM deliberately targeted probationary employees because they cannot challenge their terminations. She pointed to a Jan. 20 memo from Ezell noting that those on probationary periods \"can be terminated during that period without triggering appeal rights to the Merit Systems Protection Board.\"",
      "\"That's how insidious this action was,\" she said, adding that the plan from the beginning of Mr. Trump's second term was to fire all probationary workers because they did not have a means of challenging their removals.",
      "\"It's profoundly unlawful,\" she said.",
      "Leonard noted that probationary employees are not just those who are new to the workforce, but also includes those who recently received promotions.",
      "\"This action made Swiss cheese of the federal agencies at every level,\" she said, adding that it targeted people with \"decades\" of federal service and experience. \"They're gone. Turn in your keys.\"",
      "But Helland, the government's lawyer, argued that press releases from agencies show that their political leadership was taking credit for the terminations. He acknowledged that while OPM had a role in coordinating the efforts, it was the departments who made the final determinations of whom to fire.",
      "Alsup's latest order comes after he said last month said in separate decision providing temporary relief that the mass firings were likely unlawful\u00a0and ordered OPM to inform certain agencies that it did not have the authority to order the terminations.",
      "On the heels of that decision, Ezell and OPM issued revised guidance\u00a0telling department leaders that they do not have to take any \"specific performance-based actions\" regarding probationary employees.",
      "\"Agencies have ultimate decision-making authority over, and responsibility for, such personnel actions,\" the revised memo stated.",
      "In addition to the mass firings, Mr. Trump's efforts to drastically cut the size of the federal government included a so-called deferred resignation program, through which government workers OPM also gave federal workers the option to resign their positions but retain full pay and benefits until Sept. 30.",
      "The White House said roughly 75,000 employees accepted the offer to leave their government jobs, far fewer than the\u00a0200,000 it expected\u00a0to take the so-called buyout.",

    "story": [
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered a review of military standards, including physical fitness, body composition and grooming. It's a review Hegseth promised during his confirmation hearing when questioned about his statements he's made that military standards have eroded.",
      "\"That will be part of one of the first things we do at the Pentagon \u2014 is reviewing that in a gender-neutral way \u2014 the standards ensuring readiness and meritocracy is front and center,\" Hegseth said in January.",
      "The Pentagon released a memo Wednesday night from Hegseth that directs the undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness to review the existing standards set by the military departments.",
      "\"We must remain vigilant in maintaining the standards that enable the men and women of our military to protect the American people and our homeland as the world's most lethal and effective fighting force,\" Hegseth said. \"Our adversaries are not growing weaker, and our tasks are not growing less challenging.\"",
      "The memo directs the review to examine the standards and how they have changed since Jan. 1, 2015. In December 2015, the Defense Department announced it would open up all combat roles to women.",
      "Hegseth has previously opposed that policy decision, saying in a podcast interview shortly before he was tapped as defense secretary, \"We should not have women in combat roles. It hasn't made us more effective. Hasn't made us more lethal.\"",
      "Hegseth walked that view back somewhat during his confirmation hearing, promising that women would have access to combat roles if the standards remain high and \"have not been eroded.\"",
      "Katherine Kuzminski, the director of studies at the Center for a New American Security, told CBS News in an interview there are separate requirements for men and women, as well as for different ages, to pass the Army Combat Fitness Test that every recruit has to pass. To qualify for special forces, however, the standards are gender-neutral.",
      "\"Those standards are uniform across the genders,\" Kuzminski said, \"which is why we have only seen very small numbers of women going into special operations.\"",
      "For example, as of early January, according to data provided by the Army, there have been 156 female graduates of the notoriously grueling Ranger Course, with 381 women attending the course since it was first made available to women in 2015, for a graduation rate of approximately 41%.",
      "The Ranger Course requires all candidates to swim 15 meters in full uniform, run five miles in under 40 minutes and march 12 miles with a 35-lb. ruck, according to\u00a0the Army.",
      "\"The standards have not been lowered, and each Ranger Course graduate meets the same training standards,\" an Army official told CBS News.",
      "The Pentagon's review could lead to a change in the Army Combat Fitness test, the generic test, so that the requirements are the same for men and women.",
      "Currently, the Army Combat Fitness test is scored based on different requirements for men and women, depending on age. For instance, a man who's 17 to 21 years of age must at a minimum be able to run two miles in 22 minutes, while a woman would need to run the same distance in 23:22.

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday asked the Supreme Court to limit for now the scope of three lower court orders that broadly blocked enforcement of his executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship.",
      "The Trump administration asked the high court for emergency relief in three separate requests, which arise out of cases brought in Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington state. In all three disputes, U.S. district court judges issued orders blocking nationwide enforcement of Mr. Trump's executive order, which was issued his first day in office.",
      "Acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris is now asking the high court to limit the sweep of those orders to cover only those individuals who are directly involved in the cases.",
      "\"These cases \u2014 which involve challenges to the president's January 20, 2025 Executive Order concerning birthright citizenship \u2014 raise important constitutional questions with major ramifications for securing the border,\" she wrote in the requests. \"But at this stage, the government comes to this court with a 'modest' request: while the parties litigate weighty merits questions, the court should 'restrict the scope' of multiple preliminary injunctions that 'purpor[t] to cover every person in the country,' limiting those injunctions to parties actually within the courts' power.\"",
      "Trump's birthright citizenship order",
      "Mr. Trump issued his executive order seeking to terminate birthright citizenship on his first day in office, part of a broad, long-promised crackdown on illegal immigration across the U.S.-Mexico border. The order denies U.S. citizenship to children born to mothers who are in the country unlawfully or temporarily on visas, and whose fathers are neither citizens nor lawful permanent residents.",
      "The president's executive action sparked immediate legal challenges, including in the cases that have now arrived at the Supreme Court. The challengers all argue Mr. Trump's order violates the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment.",
      "Four U.S. district judges \u2014 in Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Washington \u2014 issued orders blocking enforcement of the president's attempt to end birthright citizenship. Efforts by the Trump administration to have U.S. appeals courts restrict the scope of three of those decisions to apply only the parties \u2014 which include 22 states, members of two organizations and seven individuals \u2014 while legal proceedings move forward have not been successful.",
      "In its request to the Supreme Court, the Trump administration said it should clear the way for the president's birthright citizenship order to partially take effect. Harris, who represents the federal government before the court, largely criticized the scope of the relief \u2014 which extends nationwide \u2014 and warned that these injunctions harm the executive branch's ability to carry out its functions.",
      "\"District courts have issued more universal injunctions and [temporary restraining orders] during February 2025 alone than through the first three years of the Biden administration,\" she wrote. \"That sharp rise in universal injunctions stops the executive branch from performing its constitutional functions before any courts fully examine the merits of those actions, and threatens to swamp this court's emergency docket.\"",
      "She noted that the decisions arising out of challenges to Mr. Trump's birthright citizenship order cover all 50 states and \"millions of aliens across the country.\"",
      "\"This court should declare that enough is enough before district courts' burgeoning reliance on universal injunctions becomes further entrenched,\" the acting solicitor general wrote.",
      "On the issue of immigration, specifically, Harris said the lower court orders impede the president's efforts to address what she said is a crisis at the southern border.",
      "\"The district courts' universal injunctions threaten to perpetuate those problems by holding out a nationwide incentive for illegal immigration: the prospect of American citizenship for the unlawful migrants' children and of derivative immigration benefits for the migrants themselves,\" she argued.",
      "Republicans and Democrats alike have sought these nationwide orders when challenging the policies of a president from the opposing political party, and decisions granting that broad relief have been criticized by administrations on both sides of the political spectrum.",
      "Even several members of the Supreme Court have expressed concern about the soundness of these broad orders, which bar the government from enforcing the policy at issue against anyone, anywhere in the country. In a\u00a02018 concurring opinion\u00a0in a\u00a0case involving Mr. Trump's travel ban\u00a0issued during his first term, Justice Clarence Thomas noted that district courts in Hawaii and Maryland entered preliminary injunctions that barred the Trump administration from enforcing the policy, and said he was skeptical they have the authority to do so.",

Weldon said he had received a call from the White House 12 hours before the scheduled hearing, informing him that the nomination would be withdrawn.",
      "\"Bobby Kennedy is a good man who really is passionate about improving the health of the American people,\" Weldon said. \"President Trump did a good thing in making him secretary of HHS.

      "Two people said Collins' staff had only asked Weldon how he would address the perception that he was against vaccines, but denied accusing him of being \"anti-vaccine.\"",
      "Weldon said that over 20 years ago, while in Congress, he raised concerns about childhood vaccine safety, and \"for some reason Collins staff suddenly couldn't get over that.\"",
      "He also claimed that another senator, Louisiana Republican Dr. Bill Cassidy, had also said he was anti-vaccine and had once asked for his nomination to be withdrawn.",
      "A spokesperson for Cassidy denied that he had asked the White House for Weldon's nomination to be withdrawn. Cassidy had been \"looking forward\" to Thursday's hearing with Weldon, the spokesperson said.",

      "Kennedy has also faced criticism this week for inflating the risks of measles vaccines when discussing the\u00a0record outbreak\u00a0in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. Kennedy, whose department oversees the CDC, also has a history of\u00a0criticizing vaccines.",

      "The nominee for a top Justice Department job has left a digital trail of deleted social media posts that his critics say suggest fringe views on a number of issues, including an openness to defying court orders and acceptance of arranged marriages under certain circumstances.",
      "In one deleted post verified by CBS News, Aaron Reitz, who has been nominated by President Trump to lead the department's Office of Legal Policy, commented on a March 2020 ruling by U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel temporarily blocking Texas from shuttering an abortion clinic during the COVID pandemic.",
      "\"Judge Yeakel has made his decision,\" Reitz wrote on the social media site X. \"Now let him enforce it.\"",
      "In another deleted post he appeared, possibly in jest, to embrace the anti-communist firebrand Joseph McCarthy. Above a picture of McCarthy, Reitz wrote, \"Bring back the good 'ol days.\"",
      "Reitz declined to comment.",
      "Senators on the Judiciary Committee will be voting Thursday on whether to advance his nomination to become assistant attorney general in charge of the Office of Legal Policy, a low-profile but highly consequential post within the Justice Department.",
      "Reitz is currently the chief of staff to Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, and before that was the deputy attorney general of Texas where he oversaw the office's so-called \"Biden Docket,\" a barrage of more than 20 lawsuits challenging the previous administration's policies, with a major focus on immigration and the border. In announcing Reitz's appointment on Truth Social, Mr. Trump praised him as a true MAGA attorney, a \"warrior for our Constitution.\"",
      "The Office of Legal Policy advises the attorney general on key matters of policy and law, works closely with Congress to craft legislation and is often at the forefront of picking and vetting federal judges. Its roughly two dozen lawyers toil away on the department's fourth floor, rarely drawing public attention and largely staying out of the political crossfire.",
      "Reitz graduated from the University of Texas Law School, where he was editor-in-chief of the Texas Review of Law & Politics. He clerked for a conservative member of the Texas Supreme Court before joining Bracewell LLP, a white-shoe law firm in Houston that once included former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani as a name partner. He is a member of the Federalist Society and also did a five-year combat tour in Helmand Province during the Afghan war.",
      "Online, Reitz has for years been an active advocate for conservative views and an avid supporter of the MAGA movement.",
      "\"Friendly reminder that 'birthright citizenship' is not a thing,\" he tweeted in 2021. He has called for rolling back reforms to mandatory minimum sentences, posting, \"make mandatory minimums great again.\" And he has inveighed against the federal right to an abortion, saying that \"roe's finding that there's a const right to abortion is garbage.\" In 2022, the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, leaving the legality of abortion to the states.",
      "But Reitz's social media monologue has at times veered into more provocative terrain. Some of those views have attracted the attention of Democrats in Congress during the confirmation process.",
      "Among them are comments he made suggesting it may be permissible in certain instances to defy a court order.\u00a0 At his confirmation hearing last month, Reitz was grilled by Democrats about what they saw as his online taunt of Judge Yeakel about his abortion ruling, challenging him to \"enforce it.\"",
      "At his confirmation hearing, Reitz responded to questioning about the post, saying, \"There is no hard and fast rule in all instances in which a litigant must comply with all or some or various parts of a judicial decision. It is so fact-law- and case-specific that one cannot speak generally.\"",
      "Some of his most extreme social media posts have eluded scrutiny until now. A review of hundreds of Reitz's posts in the past few years reveal incendiary views on a number of legal, social and political issues. Ahead of his confirmation, at least 4,000 tweets were deleted from his X feed, though it is unclear when the scrubbing took place.\u00a0 The tweets cover a cross-section of hot-button issues, from abortion to the murder of George Floyd to false claims Reitz made about the 2020 election.",
      "One of Reitz's posts suggested openness to arranged marriages.",
      "\"The more one realizes that marriage is more of a public institution than a private one, the more 'arranged' marriages (rightly understood and coupled with some limited/guiding principles) makes a lot of sense,\" he wrote.",
      "And in September 2020, Reitz seemed to want to resurrect the reputation of McCarthy, the a American demagogue who launched a furious campaign to discover and blacklist suspected communists across American society and whose name became synonymous with political witch hunts.",
      "White House spokesman Harrison Fields said in a statement, \"Aaron Reitz is an eminently-qualified nominee, who will join our incredible Attorney General Pam Bondi to ensure the Department of Justice delivers for the American people.\"",
      "Cruz's office did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Senate Judiciary Committee vote is scheduled for Thursday, and Reitz is expected to be approved on a party-line vote.",

      "Washington \u2014 Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg announced Thursday he won't seek an open Senate seat in Michigan next year, keeping the door open for a possible White House bid in 2028.",
      "\"I care deeply about who Michigan will elect as Governor and send to the U.S. Senate next year, but I have decided against competing in either race,\" Buttigieg said in a post on X Thursday.",
      "Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who served as transportation secretary under the Biden administration and recently moved to Michigan, said earlier this month that he was considering entering the race for the open seat. Democratic Sen. Gary Peters said in January that he wouldn't seek reelection in 2026.",
      "Peters' surprise announcement opened up a key seat in the battleground state. Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin won her Senate seat in November in another open race, but Michiganders also elected President Trump. And the race is expected to be among a handful that will determine control of the Senate after the GOP secured a trifecta in the 2024 elections.",
      "Buttigieg, 43, sought the Democratic nomination for president in the 2020 election, facing off against a wide field of Democrats. Buttigieg saw an early boost when he came out on top in the Iowa Caucuses, but he bowed out of the race as the party coalesced around former President Joe Biden.",
      "Buttigieg said earlier this month on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" when asked about the possible run for the Michigan Senate seat that he was \"looking at it.\"",
      "The former transportation secretary said at the time that he plans to \"continue to work on the things that I care about,\" adding that he had \"not decided what that means professionally\" or \"whether that means running for office soon or not.\"",
      "\"But I will make myself useful,\" Buttigieg added.",

      "President Trump is planning to invoke a wartime law known as the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 as soon as Friday to authorize the summary deportation of some migrants, including to Guantanamo Bay, escalating his government-wide immigration crackdown, multiple U.S. officials familiar with the plan told CBS News.",
      "The 227-year-old law\u00a0gives presidents the extraordinary power to order the arrest, detention and deportation of noncitizens who are 14 years or older and come from countries staging an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" of the U.S.",

      "Officials have made preparations to send suspected gang members to the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, soon after Mr. Trump invokes the Alien Enemies Act, two of the U.S. officials said. At Mr. Trump's direction, officials have been detaining some migrants awaiting deportation at the naval base, though the holding facilities were left empty earlier this week.",
      "Those subject to the Alien Enemies Act would not be allowed to have a court hearing or an asylum interview since they would be processed under an emergency, wartime authority \u2014 not immigration law. Instead, they would be eligible to be detained and deported, with little to no due process, under Title 50, the section of the U.S. code housing America's war and defense laws.",
      "CNN first reported Mr. Trump's plans to invoke the law as early as Friday.",
      "The Alien Enemies Act has been invoked only a few times in U.S. history, including during World War II, when the government used it to surveil and detain Italian, German and Japanese immigrants in the U.S.",
      "Its invocation to target migrants from countries with which the U.S. is not actively at war is almost certain to face legal challenges.",
      "Mr. Trump previewed his invocation of the Alien Enemies Act in an executive order issued on his first day back at the White House. It directed the secretaries of state and homeland security to plan for the potential invocation of the law and prepare facilities \"necessary to expedite the removal\" of those subject to it.",
      "\"By invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil, including our cities and inner cities,\" Mr. Trump said in his inaugural address.",

Staff members who resigned for other reasons also have not been replaced due to a government hiring freeze, he said.",
      "The Amazon trial had been scheduled to start in September. The FTC is seeking to relax some of the deadlines in the case and a delay akin to a two-month continuance. The agency does not want to \"move the trial back more than a couple of months,\" Cohen said.",

      "Even in the case of staff turnover, the government still lacks the grounds to seek a delay since changes in legal teams happen often, Hueston argued.

      "Kelsey received a \"full and unconditional pardon\" for his case and authorities were ordered to release him from prison immediately, according to a copy of the president's action provided by Kelsey's attorney.",

      "He repeated his attack on the Biden administration Tuesday, saying, \"God used Donald Trump to save me from the weaponized Biden DOJ,\" referring to the Department of Justice. In 2017, during Mr. Trump's first term, Kelsey's campaign finance dealings spurred a complaint by the nonprofit Campaign Legal Center with the Federal Election Commission and the Department of Justice.",
      "Kelsey was unsuccessful in his March 2023 attempt to rescind his guilty plea.",

      "U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw in Nashville denied the change of plea in May 2023. He expressed disbelief that Kelsey, a Georgetown University-educated attorney and prominent former state senator, didn't understand the gravity of pleading guilty.",
      "Crenshaw later denied another challenge in which Kelsey accused prosecutors of violating his plea agreement. However, that September the judge also allowed Kelsey to stay out of prison until his appeal was decided. Kelsey's challenge ultimately failed.",
      "Last month, Crenshaw denied another motion to remain free by Kelsey, who argued he had ineffective legal counsel and that his claim of innocence is supported by recordings by two key witnesses \u2014 the co-defendant, Joshua Smith, and former GOP Rep. Jeremy Durham, who was not charged. The judge responded that Kelsey had given an \"unconditional admission of guilt\" under penalty of perjury.",
      "Kelsey had another appeal pending as he received the pardon.",
      "Smith, a Nashville social club owner, pleaded guilty to one count under a deal that required him to \"cooperate fully and truthfully.\" He was sentenced to five years of probation.",

The scheme caused the political group to file false campaign finance reports and make illegal, excessive campaign contributions to Kelsey, the indictment says.",

    "story": [
      "A volcano near Alaska's largest city is showing new signs of unrest, with experts saying the likelihood of an eruption at Mount Spurr in the next few weeks or months has increased.",
      "The Alaska Volcano Observatory said Wednesday\u00a0it had measured during recent overflights \"significantly elevated volcanic gas emissions,\" and said signs indicated an eruption was likely, though not certain, in the weeks or months ahead.",
      "\"We expect to see further increases in seismic activity, gas emissions and surface heating prior to an eruption, if one were to occur,\" the observatory said in a statement. \"Such stronger unrest may provide days to weeks of additional warning.\"",
      "However, the observatory warned that it was possible that an eruption could happen with little or no warning.",
      "\"While we expect additional changes to monitoring data prior to an eruption, it is also possible that an eruption could occur with little or no additional warning,\" the observatory wrote. \"This would be extremely hazardous for recreators on Mount Spurr or near its drainages as well as those overflying the volcano.\"",
      "What is Mount Spurr?",
      "Mount Spurr is one of 53 volcanoes in Alaska that have been active within the last 250 years. It has two main vents and is 11,070 feet (3,374 meters) tall. It is covered in ice and snow and is located roughly 80 miles (129 kilometers) northwest of Anchorage.",
      "When did Mount Spurr last erupt?",
      "The last known eruption from the summit vent was more than 5,000 years ago. The Crater Peak vent, meanwhile, erupted once in 1953 and three times in 1992, according to the observatory. The Crater Peak vent is about 2 miles (3 kilometers) south of the summit.",
      "There have been periods of increased earthquake or other activity since then, including between 2004 and 2006, but no other eruptions. Last October, the observatory raised its alert status for Mount Spurr from green to yellow when an increase in seismic activity became pronounced and a ground deformation was spotted in satellite data.",
      "The most likely outcome of the current unrest would be an eruption or eruptions similar to those in 1953 and 1992, the observatory said.",
      "\"It is also possible that no eruption occurs and the present activity slowly dies away or that a smaller eruption takes place,\" John Power, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey at the observatory, wrote in an email.",
      "What impacts could an eruption have?",
      "The eruptions during the last century lasted between three and seven hours, produced ash columns that rose more than 50,000 feet (15,240 meters) above sea level and deposited ashfall in south-central Alaska communities, according to the observatory.",
      "In 1992, ashfall of about a quarter-inch in Anchorage prompted residents to stay inside or to wear masks if going outside to avoid breathing ash. The cloud drifted as far as Greenland.",
      "CBS affiliate WGME-TV reported that the ash could drift all the way to the East Coast, but that would depend on the jet stream, and it probably would not have a major impact.",
      "Volcanic ash is angular and sharp and has been used as an industrial abrasive. The powdered rock can cause a jet engine to shut down.",
      "The 1992 eruptions prompted the temporary closures of airports in Anchorage and other communities.",
      "Closing airports can be more than an inconvenience in a state where most communities aren't connected to Alaska's main road system. Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport also is among the world's busiest cargo hubs.",

This includes 112 \"tipping point\" species \u2014 those that have lost more than half their populations in the past five decades. Some, like the Allen's hummingbird, tricolored blackbird and saltmarsh sparrow, are at extreme risk without immediate intervention, says the report, released Thursday.",
      "The population of grassland birds in the U.S. has dropped by 43% since 1970, as row-crop production, drought and habitat loss take their toll, the report says. Aridland birds have declined 41% in the same period due to drought, wildfires and invasive species. Even forest birds, facing habitat degradation from fire suppression and industrial timber practices, are seeing widespread declines. Waterfowl, once considered a conservation success, have declined by 20% since 2014 from the loss of wetlands and grasslands.",
      "The findings continue a downward trend. A 2019 study published in Science, an academic journal, found that North America lost nearly 3 billion birds over the previous 50 years, including 90 \"tipping point\" species of 529 bird species that were examined.",
      "\"The 2025 State of the Birds report shows those losses are continuing, with declines among several bird trend indicators,\" the new report says. \"Notably duck populations\u2014a bright spot in past State of the Birds reports, with strong increases since 1970\u2014have trended downward in recent years.\"",
      "Conservationists have previously warned that bird populations are in steep decline due to habitat loss and climate change, and they're further alarmed after the U.S. Interior Department last month suspended a legal opinion from the Biden administration that held companies accountable for accidentally killing birds through industrial activities like oil and gas drilling, wind energy production and construction \u2013 in a victory for the energy sector.",
      "Birds play a critical role in maintaining healthy ecosystems. They help control pests, disperse seeds and pollinate plants, contributing to crop yields and supporting biodiversity, says Amanda Rodewald, faculty director of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology's Center for Avian Population Studies",
      "And declining bird populations signal larger environmental problems, experts say.",
      "\"There's a really long history and a lot of evidence that shows that birds can be excellent indicators of environmental conditions,\" Rodewald told CBS News. \"We share the same environments with birds, if they're not healthy for bird populations, they're not likely to be healthy for us either.\"",
      "Beyond their ecological role, birds bring significant economic and mental health benefits. Birdwatching contributes $279 billion to the U.S. economy and supports 1.4 million jobs, according to the report. Encounters with birds have also been linked to reduced stress and improved mental well-being, further underscoring their importance.",
      "Experts stress that conservation efforts can succeed when adequately funded. The bald eagle, once nearly wiped out by the pesticide DDT, has rebounded thanks to concerted efforts. In December, the species even gained bipartisan recognition as the official U.S. bird.",
      "Strategic habitat conservation efforts \u2014 such as conservation ranching, coastal restoration and seabird translocation \u2014 are already making a difference in some regions.",
      "The new report calls for increased investment in conservation programs, stronger habitat protections, and policies that promote sustainable land management. Without swift action, scientists warn, the next State of the Birds report could bring even graver news.",
      "\"Birds unite us across the hemisphere and across the political spectrum,\" said Marshall Johnson, chief conservation officer at the National Audubon Society. \"There should be no hesitation in moving to protect them today and in the future.\""

      "The recent flurry of expeditions launched by the Ocean Census used divers, submersibles and deep-sea robots up to 5000 meters below sea level to discover new species. The species were analyzed and confirmed in dozens of global laboratories.",
      "Some of the species discovered include:",
      "Guitar Shark",
      "Ebert, also known as the \"Lost Shark Guy,\" identified the guitar shark at 200m depths off Mozambique and Tanzania in Africa. This shark has 38 known species across the globe and shares characteristics of both sharks and rays. The guitar shark family is among the top 10 most threatened vertebrate groups and two-thirds are threatened.",
      "Turridrupa sp Gastropod",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Mar 2025 15:15:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The prehistoric facial bones were found buried in 50 feet of mud and silt, and are believed to be 1.1 to 1.4 million years old, researchers said.",
    "story": [
      "Researchers in Spain have unearthed a fossil from a potential new prehistoric member of the human family tree, and they say it's the earliest known remnants of a face discovered in Western Europe.",
      "The facial bones from an adult were found at the Atapuerca archaeological site in northern Spain in 2022. Since then, a team of scientists has been working to learn more about the hominin, whom they nicknamed Pink. The researchers shared their findings in a study in the journal\u00a0Nature, which was published on Tuesday.",
      "Pink's remains have been dated as between 1.1 and 1.4 million years old, the researchers said.",
      "The research \"introduces a new actor in the history of human evolution in Europe,\" study author Rosa Huguet, of Spain's University of Rovira i Virgili, said at a news conference, according to the AFP news agency.",
      "The discovery suggests that early humans settled in Europe, traveling from the east side of the continent to the west, about 1.4 million years ago, the researchers said. Until now, the oldest-known human species in Western Europe was the\u00a0Homo antecessor. Experts have found Homo antecessor remains that are around 850,000 years old.",
      "The oldest human ancestor found in any area of Europe is the Dmanisi people, or Homo georgicus, a group that lived in what is now the nation of Georgia. Remains of that species have been dated back to 1.8 million years ago. They are the first members of the human family known to have traveled from Africa to Europe.",
      "The face of \"Pink\"",
      "The fossilized upper jawbone and partial cheekbone were excavated from a 52-foot-deep layer of silt and mud at Sima del Elefante, or the \"elephant pit,\" a site less than 1,000 feet from where the fossils of\u00a0Homo antecessor were discovered in 1994. The bones were not enough for researchers to determine Pink's age or gender.",
      "From those fossilized bones, researchers were able to use 3D imaging techniques to create a model of Pink's face. The face is more \"projected forward and more robust\" than a modern human face or a\u00a0Homo antecessor face, Maria Martinon-Torres, director of Spain's National Research Center on Human Evolution, told the AFP.",
      "Pink's face bears some similarities to the human ancestor Homo erectus,\u00a0researchers said. That species spanned nearly 2 million years and was the first human species to evolve more familiar human body proportions and use fire and tools. Remains of the species have been found in Africa, Asia and Europe.",
      "But the similarities weren't strong enough for the scientists to confirm that Pink was a member of that species. Instead, they have proposed that Pink could belong to a new possible species, which they called Homo 'affinis' erectus.",
      "\"This is the most honest proposal we can make with the evidence we have,\" Martinon-Torres said, according to AFP.",
      "The scientists were also able to analyze small stone tools and animal bones found at the excavation site to learn more about how Pink lived. The environment at the time was a humid forest landscape, and the early human population lived alongside horses, ancient cattle, monkeys and hippos, the researchers said. The area also likely had plenty of water, which would have made it an \"ideal\" place for the species to settle, Huguet said in the news conference.",
      "The researchers suggested that the species may be a bridge between the\u00a0Homo georgicus species and the\u00a0Homo antecessor species. Study co-author Jose Maria Bermudez de Castro told the AFP that it's likely the species \"probably disappeared\" during a severe global cooling era that occurred nearly 900,000 years ago.",
      "Research at the excavation site will continue, the scientists said.",

    "story": [
      "Astronomy fans are in for a treat this March as the full moon will appear to turn red during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "March's full moon, known as the Worm Moon, will pass into Earth's shadow on the night of March 13, or early on March 14, depending on the time zone, according to NASA. This eclipse will be visible from Earth's Western Hemisphere.",
      "The Old Farmer's Almanac details specific moonrise times for ZIP codes across the U.S. Local forecasts also include detailed information on how clear the night sky will be in various locations.",
      "What is a lunar eclipse?",
      "A lunar eclipse happens when the sun, Earth and moon all align so that the moon passes into the Earth's shadow. During a total lunar eclipse, like the one happening this March, the entire moon will fall within the darkest part of Earth's shadow.",
      "Each lunar eclipse is visible from half of Earth.",
      "There are also partial and penumbral eclipses, which are when the sun, Earth and moon are not perfectly aligned.",
      "Why does the moon look red during the lunar eclipse?",
      "With the moon in the shadow of the Earth, it will appear red-orange, according to NASA. Lunar eclipses are sometimes called blood moons because of the phenomenon.",
      "During a lunar eclipse, the moon gets its red coloration because any sunlight that's not blocked by the Earth is filtered through a \"thick slice of Earth's atmosphere\" as it heads toward the moon's surface, according to NASA. The more dust or clouds in Earth's atmosphere during the total lunar eclipse, the redder the moon will appear.",
      "\"It's as if all the world's sunrises and sunsets are projected onto the Moon,\" NASA explains in a blog post.",
      "This is the same phenomenon that makes the sky appear blue during the day.",
      "Why is March's full moon called the worm moon?",
      "The Worm Moon nickname may have come from the earthworms typically found as spring nears, according to the\u00a0Old Farmer's Almanac. Other research suggests the name may date back to writings from the 1760s about worms, or beetle larvae, coming out from bark as trees thaw from the winter.",
      "There are also other names for March's full moon related to the transition from winter to spring. The first day of spring will be on March 20, just days after the Worm Moon.",
      "Other names for March's full moon are the Eagle Moon, Goose Moon, Crow Comes Back Moon, Sugar Moon, Wind Strong Moon and Sore Eyes Moon.",
      "What else can you see during the full Blood Worm Moon?",
      "If there's a bit of rain during the full moon, there may be a rare moonbow, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. It's like a rainbow, but created by moonlight, rather than sunlight. Moonbows only happen when the full Moon is fairly low in the sky, so the phenomenon would be most apparent in the hours after sunset when the sky is dark.",
      "Viewers can also look to the western sky on the night of the total lunar eclipse to catch a glimpse of Jupiter and Mars, according to NASA. Constellations may also be easier to spot than usual as Earth's shadow dims the Moon's glow.",

      "Those who glance up at the sky tonight will have an opportunity to catch the March 2025 \"Blood Moon,\" a phenomenon that colors the full moon in shades of red, orange and yellow during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "This month's full moon is due to pass through the shadow of Earth either late tonight, March 13, or very early tomorrow morning, March 14, depending on the viewer's time zone. It should be visible to people in the Americas and elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere.",
      "Dubbed the \"Worm Moon\" by the Farmer's Almanac, which has been assigning names to full moons for almost a century, this one is expected to start taking shape Wednesday evening and is supposed to last through Saturday morning, according to NASA. The full moon will technically rise in its totality early Friday.",
      "Here's what to know about the event \u2014 and why the moon will bear a new hue when it happens.",
      "Why will the moon be red, orange and yellow tonight?",
      "The moon will appear to turn red late tonight or early tomorrow morning, depending on skywatchers' locations, as Earth passes directly between it and the sun in what's known as a total lunar eclipse. Their perfect alignment darkens the moon, from the perspective of folks looking up, because our planet's position blocks most sunlight from reaching it.",
      "Some light still makes its way to the moon's surface, but only certain shades of it. The colors that wind up there are longer wavelengths of light \u2014 red, orange, yellow \u2014 which withstood the journey through \"a thick slice of Earth's atmosphere,\" NASA said.",
      "Shorter wavelengths of the color spectrum, like blue, scatter easily when they hit the atmosphere. That's why a vast sky can look blue in the middle of the day, when sunlight can shine straight down from overhead. Longer wavelengths materialize on Earth when sunlight hits from more of a perpendicular angle, so its route through our atmosphere can be more extensive. Short wavelengths are essentially filtered out by the atmosphere over such a protracted distance, and only the longer reds, oranges and yellows remain.",
      "What is a \"Blood Moon\"?",
      "\"Blood Moon\" is a nickname that refers to the moon's reddish appearance during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "The full moon will take on several shades of red, orange and yellow when it's nearer the outer edges of Earth's shadow \u2014 when it first intersects with the path of Earth's shadow, for example, and as it's on its way out. But shades of deep red will become more pronounced as the moon enters the darkest part of the shadow.",
      "What exactly causes a \"Blood Moon\"?",
      "A \"Blood Moon\" happens during a total lunar eclipse, when the sun, Earth and the moon align in that order. Long wavelengths of sunlight are refracted through Earth's atmosphere before reaching the moon, which reflects them in reddish hues that may resemble the color of blood.",
      "How to see the \"Blood Moon\" lunar eclipse",
      "The upcoming \"Blood Moon\" will begin before the full moon reaches its brightness point tonight.",
      "As the lunar eclipse gets underway, the moon will start moving through Earth's shadow at 11:57 p.m. EDT. It will become steadily dimmer over the next several hours as it travels toward the darkest part of the shadow and, eventually, appear fully darkened from around 2:26 p.m. to 3:31 a.m. in the early hours of Friday. The most ideal opportunity to see the reddish moon is during the minutes leading up to 3 a.m. EDT, as the moon should be situated in the center of Earth's shadow around then.",

    "story": [
      "A space probe flying past Mars captured images of the red planet's small, mysterious moon.",
      "The space probe, named Hera, was launched on Oct. 7, 2024, and is on a mission to gather close-up data about the Dimorphos asteroid, the European Space Agency said in a news release. The asteroid was the first to have its orbit altered by human action, when it was impacted by NASA's DART spacecraft in 2022. The goal of Hera is to learn more about asteroid deflection so the technique can be refined and used again.",
      "While on a flyby of Mars, Hera was able to use three of its imaging instruments to capture images of Deimos, the smaller of Mars' two moons, the ESA said. Deimos is about 15,000 miles from Mars. Scientists have previously speculated that it may actually be a piece of asteroid, not a moon.",
      "Hera got as close as 1,000 kilometers, or about 620 miles, to Deimos. It used its various instruments to capture the images, characterize the mineral makeup on the moon and chart surface temperatures. These features combined will help scientists learn more about the lunar body, the ESA said.",
      "\"These instruments have been tried out before, during Hera's departure from Earth, but this is the first time that we have employed them on a small distant moon for which we still lack knowledge \u2013 demonstrating their excellent performance in the process,\" ESA Hera mission scientist Michael Kueppers said in the news release.",
      "The ESA's Mars Express, which has been orbiting the red planet for over 20 years, also contributed observations of the moon. Results from the encounter should help guide operational planning for a mission set to explore Martian moons in 2026, the ESA said. That mission, in conjunction with NASA and French and German space agencies, will collect detailed measurements of Mars' two moons and land on Phobos, the larger lunar body, to collect a sample that can be returned to Earth for analysis.",
      "Hera also used the flyby of Mars to adjust its trajectory through deep space. That maneuver shortened Hera's travel time to Dimorphos, the ESA said. Hera will also collect information about Didymos, the asteroid that Dimorphos orbits around. Hera is expected to reach the Didymos in December 2026, the ESA said.",
      "\"This has been the Hera team's first exciting experience of exploration, but not our last,\" said Hera mission manager Ian Carnelli in the news release. \"In 21 months the spacecraft will reach our target asteroids, and start our crash site investigation of the only object in our Solar System to have had its orbit measurably altered by human action.\"",

If the problem can be resolved in time, NASA and SpaceX will make another attempt to launch the crew Friday evening.",
      "The scrub will add at least two more days to the eventual return to Earth of Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and pilot Sunita Williams, along with two other outgoing space station crew members.",
      "Crew-10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov were strapped in and ready for blastoff from historic pad 39 at the Kennedy Space Center at 7:48 p.m. EDT Wednesday.",
      "But throughout the final few hours of the countdown, SpaceX engineers were troubleshooting an apparent problem with one of two clamp arms that hold the Falcon 9 rocket to its launch support gantry. Hydraulics are used to retract the two clamps prior to launch, and while the system appeared to be working normally, it wasn't clear whether one of the arms would retract fully.",
      "A launch opportunity Thursday was ruled out due to expected high winds and to give engineers more time to assess data and determine what, if any, repairs are needed. If the hydraulics problem can be resolved in time, NASA and SpaceX could be ready to press ahead with a launch attempt at 7:03 p.m. Friday.",
      "Whenever Crew-10 takes off, rendezvous and docking with the space station is expected the following day.",
      "Standing by to welcome them aboard will be Crew-9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams, along with cosmonauts Alexsey Ovchinin, Ivan Vagner and NASA astronaut Don Pettit, who were launched last September aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.",
      "McClain and her crewmates will spend two days getting briefed by Crew-9 on the intricacies of space station operations before Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams undock on March 19\u00a0for their return to Earth. The normal \"handover\" period is five days or so, but mission managers shortened it this time around to maintain the lab's food reserves.",
      "While the ongoing saga of the \"stranded\" Starliner astronauts has overshadowed the Crew-10 mission, McClain said she and her crewmates began training for their mission in 2023 and they were all eager to finally get into space. McClain and Onishi are space station veterans while Ayers and Peskov are making their first flight.",
      "All four are veteran military or commercial pilots. Before joining NASA, McClain, an active-duty Army colonel, served as a combat helicopter pilot while Ayers, an Air Force major, is a veteran F-22 Raptor pilot. Onishi served as a commercial pilot in Japan, flying Boeing 767 jetliners, and Peskov is an experienced commercial 757 pilot.",
      "\"We're going to have planned and unplanned maintenance to keep the space station running,\" McClain said. \"We have a plethora of science experiments, both inside and outside of the space station. We have spacewalks. We have visiting vehicles (and) the potential of (hosting) private astronaut missions.\"",
      "\"They're ready to come home\"",
      "As for Wilmore and Williams, McClain said, \"honestly, I'm kind of most looking forward to breaking bread with those guys, talking to them, giving them big hugs. We go way back. ... We're ready to go up there. They're ready to come home.\"",
      "\"This is a huge mission for us on Crew 10,\" said Steve Stich, manager of the commercial crew program that oversees SpaceX Crew Dragons and Boeing's Starliner. \"They're all big, but this started all the way back to Crew 9 when we launched that mission with two empty seats, and we had those seats reserved for Butch and Suni.\"",
      "The Starliner astronauts have \"just done a phenomenal job,\" Stich said, \"and so we're excited to bring them back.\"",
      "Given an on-time launch for Crew 10 Friday, Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams could undock on March 19 and land as early as March 20 or 21. If so, the Starliner astronauts will have logged 288 days or so \u2014  9.5 months \u2014  \u00a0in space on a flight originally expected to last a little longer than one week. Hague and Gorbunov's time in space will come to about 173 days.",
      "The U.S. record for longest single spaceflight is held by astronaut Frank Rubio, who spent 371 days in space because of problems with the Soyuz spacecraft that carried him to orbit. Like the Starliner crew, he was forced to extend his mission and come home on a different Soyuz.",
      "In any case, what would normally be a relatively routine crew rotation, sending up four crew members to replace four others wrapping up a five- to six-month station visit, has turned into political theater, fueled by repeated criticism from President Trump and Elon Musk blaming the Biden administration for the Starliner crew's predicament.",
      "Musk said in a post on his social media platform X that he offered to \"go get\" Wilmore and Williams earlier, but the offer was turned down. He did not say who turned the proposal down or even whether it was someone at NASA or the White House.",
      "\"Biden left them up there,\" Mr. Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on March 6. \"We have two astronauts that are stuck in space. I have asked Elon, I said, do me a favor, can you get 'em out? He said yes. He is preparing to go up I think in two weeks.\"",
      "But the Crew Dragon he was referring to will not be bringing Wilmore and Williams back to Earth. It will be carrying the Crew-10 fliers and will remain docked at the outpost for the next five months. Their arrival does, however, clear the way for Crew-9, including Wilmore and Williams, to finally return to Earth aboard their own Crew Dragon.",
      "That Crew Dragon, which carried Hague and Gorbunov to the station last September for a normal tour of duty, has been docked at the lab ever since. It was launched with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams so their ride home has been at the station for the past five-and-a-half months.",
      "NASA could have brought Crew-9 down earlier, but that would have left a single astronaut, Pettit, aboard the lab to operate and maintain the U.S. segment of the space station. Research would have ground to a halt and he would have had difficulty in a variety of emergency scenarios.",
      "\"Sure, it could have taken us home, but that leaves only three people on the space station from the Soyuz crew, two Russians and one American,\" Williams told CBS News in an in-flight interview. \"And, you know, the space station is big. It's a building, you know, it's the size of a football field. Things happen.",
      "\"So things can go wrong, and you need to be able to fix it, either inside and outside. And so having additional people to be able to do that is really important.\"",
      "\"We don't feel stranded\"",
      "Both Wilmore and Williams have repeatedly said they are not \"stranded\" and have not been \"abandoned\" in space.",
      "\"That's been the narrative from day one, stranded, abandoned, stuck, and I get it, we both get it,\" Wilmore told a reporter during a recent interview. \"But that is, again, not what our human space flight program is about. We don't feel abandoned, we don't feel stuck, we don't feel stranded.",
      "\"We come prepared. We come committed. That is what your human space flight program is. It prepares for any and all contingencies that we can conceive of, and we prepare for those. ... Let's change (the narrative) to 'prepared' and 'committed.'\"",
      "And so, NASA's plan to bring the Starliner astronauts home, a plan managers said minimized disruption to the space station crew rotation schedule, has been in place since last August. Even so, the president has repeatedly blamed the Biden administration for the extended mission.",
      "NASA managers have not openly challenged the president's comments and have generally downplayed their responses to questions about Musk's claim to have offered to launch another Crew Dragon to bring Wilmore and Williams home.",
      "Last August, Stich was asked about the possibility of launching a mission specifically to bring the Starliner crew back to Earth. He told reporters during a news conference that the agency \"really never considered that option.\"",
      "\"From the very beginning, we liked the option of modifying Crew-9 or Crew-8,\" he said, referring to the option of adding Williams and Wilmore to Hague's crew or whether to shoehorn them into a Crew Dragon that brought four other station fliers back to Earth last October.",
      "\"We looked at both of those and bringing them back on either one of those vehicles,\" Stich said at the time. \"We're trying to lay out the rest of our manifest to make sure we have vehicles available for all the flights. It just didn't make sense to go ahead and accelerate a flight to return Butch and Suni earlier.\"",
      "What went wrong with Boeing's Starliner?",
      "Wilmore and Williams were launched aboard a Boeing Starliner capsule last June 5 for the spacecraft's first piloted test flight. They successfully docked with the International Space Station the next day, but the Starliner experienced multiple helium propulsion system leaks and several maneuvering jets that did not produce the expected thrust.",
      "NASA carried out weeks of tests and analysis to determine whether the Starliner could be trusted to safely bring its crew back to Earth.",
      "By August, Boeing managers were convinced engineers understood the problems and the crew could safely come home in the Starliner. But NASA managers disagreed and ruled that option out. Instead, as Stich described, they decided to keep the astronauts aboard the station until early this year\u00a0when they could hitch a ride back aboard the Crew-9 Dragon.",
      "The Starliner astronauts took the news of a lengthy mission extension in stride.",
      "\"Butch, and I knew this was a test flight, we knew that we would probably find some things (that did not work as expected), and we found some stuff,\" Williams told CBS News. \"And so that was not a surprise. The discussion went over the summer, and as things started unrolling, unraveling, we sort of understood that, hey, we might be up here a little bit longer.",
      "\"And that's what our job is. We have both been in the military, both Navy guys, our deployments have been extended. You do what's right for the team, and what was right for the team is to stay up here and be expedition crew members for the International Space Station.\"",
      "Last September, Boeing successfully brought the Starliner down by remote control and NASA launched the Crew-9 mission aboard a Crew Dragon carrying just two crew members, Hague and Gorbunov, along with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "The Starliner astronauts joined the Crew-9 expedition and originally expected to return to Earth in February after arrival of the next Crew Dragon in the crew rotation sequence. But the Crew-10 Dragon, a new vehicle making its first flight, ran into problems that delayed launch, and Crew-9's return, to the end of March.",
      "NASA eventually decided to switch Crew-10 to a different Dragon, enabling a launch on March 12, a few weeks earlier than the previous late March target. Stich said the capsule swap and slightly earlier launch date were not the result of any outside pressure.",
      "The decision \"really was driven by a lot of other factors,\" Stich said. \"We were looking at this before some of those statements were made by the President and Mr. Musk.\"",
      "Said Ken Bowersox, NASA's chief of spaceflight operations at agency Headquarters: \"I can verify that Steve had been talking about how we might need to juggle the flights and switch capsules a good month before there was any discussion outside of NASA.\"",
      "\"But the president's interest sure added energy to the conversation, and it's great to have a president who's interested in what we're doing.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 09 Mar 2025 16:47:34 -0400",
    "summary": "Faced with the need to cut carbon emissions, and an increasing energy demand to power AI, companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon are investing in nuclear, from restarting Three Mile Island, to creating \"small modular reactors.\"",
    "story": [
      "It might have seemed like one of the weirder headlines of 2024: Microsoft is paying $1.6 billion to restart Three Mile Island. That's the nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania whose reactor #2 had a partial meltdown in 1979. There were no injuries, and nobody died, but it set the nuclear industry back years. Only two new plants have been started since that accident.",
      "\"This is hallowed ground in the nuclear industry,\" said Joe Dominguez, the CEO of Constellation Energy, which owns about half of America's 54 nuclear plants (including Three Mile Island). \"This is a place where we learned and got better.\"",
      "He says that, as a result of the 1979 accident, there have been thousands of changes in protocols and procedures regarding nuclear power. \"The thing that people forget is that there was another reactor at the site,\" he said. \"That site, that reactor, continued to operate until 2019, when it was closed for economic reasons. Cheap natural gas, low demand, subsidization of different technologies in the business, [and] no policy supporting nuclear caused plants to start retiring.\"",
      "So, what is Microsoft's interest?",
      "All  of the Big Tech companies have ambitious goals to fight the climate  crisis. That includes Google and Microsoft, which have each  pledged to reach net zero carbon emissions. They were making progress, too; each has invested billions in wind and solar energy.",
      "And then, then artificial intelligence came along. AI data centers require huge amounts of electricity. \u00a0Big Tech realized that they wouldn't make their emissions goals without taking power into their own hands.",
      "Dominguez said, \"Microsoft is going to enjoy the benefit of the reliable, clean energy for 20 years.\"",
      "He says reopening the existing Three Mile Island facility would be quicker and less expensive than constructing a brand-new nuclear plant. \"At least 10 times cheaper than building a new plant,\" he said. \"And we think we could get it going in about three years, versus the last plant that was built, [which] took almost 10 years.\"",
      "But if you're a tech company, what do you do if you don't have a recently-retired nuclear plant handy? You develop new ones. Only weeks after Microsoft's announcement, both Amazon and Google announced major investments in nuclear power.",
      "Google turns to nuclear energy for AI electricity demand",
      "Google turns to nuclear energy for AI electricity demand",
      "Google is supplementing its already enormous green energy investments with a new kind of nuclear, called small modular reactors. \"These are not the nuclear power plants of yesterday, with the very large cooling towers,\" said Michael Terrell, who heads Google's decarbonization efforts. \"These are much smaller facilities. But because they're modular, you can stack them together to make bigger power plants.",
      "He anticipates the first advanced nuclear reactor will be online by 2030. \"And we're not going to do just one reactor, but we hope to buy from what will be a series of reactors that follow that,\" Terrell said.",
      "Nuclear power still isn't perfect; it still produces waste that has to be safely stored. But unlike solar and wind, nuclear power is always on, which is essential to those AI data centers.",
      "So, Google is funding a company called Kairos Power to design and build this new generation of reactors. Kairos is building three small demonstration plants in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, on the very spot where uranium was processed for the first atomic bomb.",
      "CEO Mike Laufer says that his reactors don't use fuel rods; they use fuel pebbles, about the size of golf balls \u2013 mostly graphite, with tiny kernels of uranium. And each pebble has as much power capacity as four tons of coal.",
      "And how much carbon dioxide emissions, compared to coal? \"Zero,\" Laufer said.",
      "The Kairos reactors also run at lower power and lower pressure than traditional reactors, which means lower risk.",
      "Well, this all sounds great! But what's the catch?",
      "\"There's only one problem with small modular reactors: They don't really exist,\" said George Washington University professor Sharon Squassoni, who spent 15 years researching nuclear safety for the government. She thinks Big Tech companies might be in over their heads. \"I think they're going to find out pretty quickly that it takes way too long and it's way too expensive,\" she said. \"I think we're going to see just how strong their commitments are to clean energy futures.\"",
      "\"So, you're saying they may have to turn to burning stuff [for power]?\" I asked.",
      "\"I'm pretty sure they will,\" Squassoni replied.",
      "\"Do you think there's a little bit of tech-bro overconfidence therein?\"",
      "\"Oh, completely, completely!\" she laughed.",
      "Kairos' Mike Laufer admitted, \"Yes, it's really hard. I will totally agree with anyone. But we're doing it at smaller scale to start, and then building on that in the future.\"",
      "Joe Dominguez's team is getting Three Mile Island ready for Microsoft, including renaming the plant the Crane Clean Energy Center. And if AI is igniting a renaissance in American nuclear, he says: full steam ahead.",
      "I asked, \"Why do all new plants take so much longer and cost so much more than projected?\"",
      "\"Honest answer? We don't build enough of them,\" Dominguez said. \"You don't want to build a unique design; you want to do kind of a cookie-cutter, one-after-another design.\"",
      "\"Is it well understood in government and the industry that if you start doing the same design over and over, we can get there faster and cheaper?\"",
      "\"It's probably the best understood idea,\" Dominguez said. \"It's understood by both Republicans and Democrats, which is a hard thing to say about anything! Everybody understands that if you build a common design, you build a bunch of them.\"",
      "\"So, you think we'll get there?\"",
      "\"I do.\"",
      "Google's Michael Terrell agrees, and believes his company will make its zero-carbon goal by 2030. \"It is an incredibly ambitious goal: 24/7 carbon-free energy everywhere we operate every way around the world,\" he said. \"But it's something we're working very hard to achieve, and we hope to get there.\"",

      "\"The last 10 years, we are definitely becoming warmer earlier,\" said Greene, who runs Greene Maple Farms. \"We're not getting the cold and the gradual warm-up. We're getting warm-up, warm-up, warm-up, with deep freezes in between.\"",

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he'll vote to keep the government open as the chamber prepares to take up a\u00a0GOP stopgap bill\u00a0continuing government funding Friday.",
      "\"I believe it is my job to make the best choice for the country, to minimize the harms to the American people,\" Schumer said. \"Therefore, I will vote to keep the government open, and not shut it down.\"",
      "His support for the measure signaled that Democrats would let the measure pass to prevent a shutdown as the caucus grappled Thursday with the uncomfortable choice.",
      "In a lengthy speech from the Senate floor, the New York Democrat outlined his opposition to the House-passed bill but went on to say that his bigger worry was about what failing to fund the government could bring. He warned that a government shutdown would give President Trump and his allies \"the keys to the city, state and country,\" arguing that \"while the CR bill is very bad, the potential for a shutdown has consequences for America that are much, much worse.\"",
      "The Senate plans to take up the House-passed bill to fund the government through September beginning on Friday. Republicans need 60 votes to invoke cloture and advance the measure, meaning it will need the support of Democrats to get to a vote on final passage. Speaking to reporters after his remarks, Schumer wouldn't say whether enough Democrats would support advancing the measure, noting that \"each is making his or her own decision.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Senate Democrats have been considering a plan to pave the way for a vote on final passage of the Republican-led bill in exchange for a doomed-to-fail vote on their own 30-day alternative. Schumer told reporters that the option remains their preference, but no agreement has been reached with Senate Republican leadership.",
      "With government funding set to expire on Friday night, Democrats have found themselves in the position of being able to block the GOP bill, but also wary of the government shutdown that would ensue if they do so. Democratic leaders have instead been pushing for a 30-day funding extension that would allow more time for negotiations on new spending bills \u2014 a nonstarter, given Republican control of the House and Senate.",
      "A possible solution began to emerge after Senate Democrats met on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. The plan would call for Democrats to provide the votes needed to advance the GOP bill in exchange for a vote on an amendment with their own one-month stopgap measure, which would almost certainly fail. Democrats who oppose the GOP version could then vote against its final passage. Some members see it as a way to save face while also avoiding a shutdown.",
      "\"I think we're going to all be 'no' on cloture unless we get an agreement to propose at least this 30-day clean [continuing resolution] amendment and maybe a couple of others,\" Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia told reporters Thursday. \"So we'll be 'no' on cloture unless we get an agreement to do that. I'm not aware of whether the Republicans have agreed to that yet, but we'll be 'no' on cloture if we don't get it, and I think that's a unified position.\"",
      "The House approved the six-month funding measure on Tuesday largely along party lines, sending the funding fight to the Senate.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters ahead of Schumer's remarks that his office has been in touch with the minority leader's staff, but Democrats haven't made a formal offer. Thune noted that if Democrats want a vote on the 30-day continuing resolution in exchange for helping Republicans reach the 60-vote threshold on the House-passed bill, \"they can get that.\"",
      "\"There's basically one path to keep the government from shutting down and one door to unlock, and Democrats have the keys,\" he said. Thune filed cloture on the House-passed measure Thursday night, setting up a Friday vote.",
      "Democrats emerged from Wednesday's meeting touting their alternate plan that would fund the government until April 11. Schumer warned Republicans that they do not have the votes to approve the House-passed stopgap measure, which increases defense spending and funding for veterans' health care, while decreasing non-defense spending below 2024 levels.",
      "Although efforts to fund the government usually find bipartisan support, Democrats widely oppose the measure and have expressed frustration with the spending reductions, while warning that it would give the Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency even more latitude to carry out cost-slashing efforts. The possibility of forcing a shutdown is one of the few points of leverage Democrats have as the minority in both chambers.",
      "But Democrats also fear the fallout of a lapse in funding, which could serve as the pretext for the Trump administration to make even deeper cuts across the federal workforce. Some Senate Democrats see the plan to vote for cloture but against final passage as a way to thread the needle, while others have argued that a vote on the short-term continuing resolution isn't for show.",
      "Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, said the approach isn't a gimmick, noting the bipartisan work that has been done so far on new funding bills that would go by the wayside with the House-passed funding extension.",
      "\"What would be an absolute crime is to support a House bill written only by Republicans,\" Merkley said, adding, \"You don't stop a bully by handing over your lunch money, and you don't stop a president like Trump from being authoritarian by proceeding to give in and give him more power again.\"",
      "Frustrations appeared to mount among Democrats throughout the day on Thursday, as they met again behind closed doors on the issue. Schumer told his caucus during the meeting that he planned to vote to advance the GOP funding measure, a source familiar confirmed to CBS News. As the meeting let out, a number of Democrats released statements on social media announcing that they would vote no on the House-passed continuing resolution, while they otherwise remained tight-lipped about their intentions.",
      "Meanwhile, some outspoken progressives have denounced the plan, saying the party is capitulating to the president and Republicans while getting nothing substantive in return.",
      "\"I hope Senate Democrats understand there is nothing clever about setting up a fake failed 30 day CR first to turn around & vote for cloture on the GOP spending bill,\" New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez posted on X on Thursday. \"Those games won't fool anyone. It won't trick voters, it won't trick House members. People will not forget it.\"",
      "Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, the sole Democrat who publicly said he would back the House-passed measure, likewise criticized the idea of exchanging support for cloture for a vote on the short-term continuing resolution.",
      "\"The House GOP CR will then pass the Senate because it only needs 51 votes,\" Fetterman said in a post on X. \"Total theater is neither honest with constituents nor a winning argument.\"",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge William Alsup extended relief to fired workers at the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Interior and Treasury.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in California ordered six federal agencies to reinstate probationary employees who were fired last month, finding that their terminations by the Office of Personnel Management were unlawful.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco handed down his order in a challenge brought by a group of unions against the Trump administration from the bench. He said that neither OPM nor its Acting Director Charles Ezell had the authority to direct the terminations across agencies.",
      "The order extends relief to fired workers at the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Interior and Treasury.",
      "\"It is a sad, sad day when our government would fire some good employee and say it was based on performance when they know good and well that's a lie,\" Alsup said at the end of a hearing on the unions' request for a preliminary injunction. \"That should not have been done in our country. It was a sham in order to avoid statutory requirements.\"",
      "The judge, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, noted that federal law allows for agencies to engage in a \"reduction-in-force,\" the government's name for mass layoffs, but doing so comes with several requirements.",
      "\"It can be done if it's in accordance with the law,\" he said. \"This case is not about that. What this case is about is really an attempt to do a reduction-in-force\" through OPM. He said that having OPM, the federal government's chief human resources agency, direct departments to fire probationary workers was an \"easy way to get a reduction-in-force underway\" and a \"gimmick.\"",
      "The judge also criticized President Trump's firing of former special counsel Hampton Dellinger and attempts to get rid of members of the Merit Systems Protection Board, which oversees the administrative appeals of federal workers challenging their firings. A federal judge in Washington ordered that Cathy Harris, a member of the MSPB removed by Mr. Trump, return to her role. The Trump administration has appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.",
      "Alsup said Mr. Trump's removals of Harris and Dellinger were likely part of efforts to \"decimate\" the MSPB and ensure \"these employees will have no recourse.\"",
      "Spokespeople for the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Interior declined to comment. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that a \"single judge is attempting to unconstitutionally seize the power of hiring and firing from the executive branch.\"",
      "\"The president has the authority to exercise the power of the entire executive branch \u2014 singular district court judges cannot abuse the power of the entire judiciary to thwart the president's agenda. If a federal district court judge would like executive powers, they can try and run for president themselves,\" she said. \"The Trump administration will immediately fight back against this absurd and unconstitutional order.\"",
      "The hearing",
      "The judge's order came at the end of a roughly two-hour-long hearing on the unions' request for a preliminary injunction. He repeatedly condemned the Trump administration's efforts to keep key officials, namely Ezell, from testifying in the early stages of the litigation.",
      "Ahead of the hearing, the Justice Department had withdrawn a declaration from Ezell. Lawyers for the unions said the move was part of an effort to keep him from having to answer their questions. In an order issued Monday, Alsup said that if Ezell failed to appear, the court \"will have to decide the sanction.\"",
      "The judge told Kelsey Helland, a Justice Department lawyer, that allowing the acting OPM head to be questioned by lawyers representing the unions \"will reveal the truth.\"",
      "Noting his decades on the bench, Alsup said, \"I know how we get at the truth, and you're not helping me.\" He accused the government of frustrating his ability to find out whether OPM directed agencies to fire probationary workers, or whether the agency heads acted on their own.",
      "But in the end, Alsup concluded that the human resources agency directed departments to get rid of the workers, with the exception of those considered \"mission critical.\" He rejected the Justice Department's attempts to argue that press releases announcing the terminations show the agency heads themselves were the decisionmakers.",
      "The Trump administration last month fired thousands of probationary employees, generally those who were in their roles for less than a year, as part of the president's efforts to shrink the size of the federal government.",
      "The notices informed the affected federal employees that they were being terminated for performance reasons. Shortly after, a group of unions representing government workers, the state of Washington and nonprofit organizations challenged the mass firings, arguing that OPM lacked the authority to order agencies to carry them out.",
      "Danielle Leonard, a lawyer for the unions, said during Thursday's hearing that the firings were not done at the discretion of each agency and argued OPM deliberately targeted probationary employees because they cannot challenge their terminations. She pointed to a Jan. 20 memo from Ezell noting that those on probationary periods \"can be terminated during that period without triggering appeal rights to the Merit Systems Protection Board.\"",
      "\"That's how insidious this action was,\" she said, adding that the plan from the beginning of Mr. Trump's second term was to fire all probationary workers because they did not have a means of challenging their removals.",
      "\"It's profoundly unlawful,\" she said.",
      "Leonard noted that probationary employees are not just those who are new to the workforce, but also includes those who recently received promotions.",
      "\"This action made Swiss cheese of the federal agencies at every level,\" she said, adding that it targeted people with \"decades\" of federal service and experience. \"They're gone. Turn in your keys.\"",
      "But Helland, the government's lawyer, argued that press releases from agencies show that their political leadership was taking credit for the terminations. He acknowledged that while OPM had a role in coordinating the efforts, it was the departments who made the final determinations of whom to fire.",
      "Alsup's latest order comes after he said last month said in separate decision providing temporary relief that the mass firings were likely unlawful\u00a0and ordered OPM to inform certain agencies that it did not have the authority to order the terminations.",
      "On the heels of that decision, Ezell and OPM issued revised guidance\u00a0telling department leaders that they do not have to take any \"specific performance-based actions\" regarding probationary employees.",
      "\"Agencies have ultimate decision-making authority over, and responsibility for, such personnel actions,\" the revised memo stated.",
      "In addition to the mass firings, Mr. Trump's efforts to drastically cut the size of the federal government included a so-called deferred resignation program, through which government workers OPM also gave federal workers the option to resign their positions but retain full pay and benefits until Sept. 30.",
      "The White House said roughly 75,000 employees accepted the offer to leave their government jobs, far fewer than the\u00a0200,000 it expected\u00a0to take the so-called buyout.",

    "summary": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth vowed in January to review \"in a gender-neutral way\" readiness standards for troops.",
    "story": [
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered a review of military standards, including physical fitness, body composition and grooming. It's a review Hegseth promised during his confirmation hearing when questioned about his statements he's made that military standards have eroded.",
      "\"That will be part of one of the first things we do at the Pentagon \u2014 is reviewing that in a gender-neutral way \u2014 the standards ensuring readiness and meritocracy is front and center,\" Hegseth said in January.",
      "The Pentagon released a memo Wednesday night from Hegseth that directs the undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness to review the existing standards set by the military departments.",
      "\"We must remain vigilant in maintaining the standards that enable the men and women of our military to protect the American people and our homeland as the world's most lethal and effective fighting force,\" Hegseth said. \"Our adversaries are not growing weaker, and our tasks are not growing less challenging.\"",
      "The memo directs the review to examine the standards and how they have changed since Jan. 1, 2015. In December 2015, the Defense Department announced it would open up all combat roles to women.",
      "Hegseth has previously opposed that policy decision, saying in a podcast interview shortly before he was tapped as defense secretary, \"We should not have women in combat roles. It hasn't made us more effective. Hasn't made us more lethal.\"",
      "Hegseth walked that view back somewhat during his confirmation hearing, promising that women would have access to combat roles if the standards remain high and \"have not been eroded.\"",
      "Katherine Kuzminski, the director of studies at the Center for a New American Security, told CBS News in an interview there are separate requirements for men and women, as well as for different ages, to pass the Army Combat Fitness Test that every recruit has to pass. To qualify for special forces, however, the standards are gender-neutral.",
      "\"Those standards are uniform across the genders,\" Kuzminski said, \"which is why we have only seen very small numbers of women going into special operations.\"",
      "For example, as of early January, according to data provided by the Army, there have been 156 female graduates of the notoriously grueling Ranger Course, with 381 women attending the course since it was first made available to women in 2015, for a graduation rate of approximately 41%.",
      "The Ranger Course requires all candidates to swim 15 meters in full uniform, run five miles in under 40 minutes and march 12 miles with a 35-lb. ruck, according to\u00a0the Army.",
      "\"The standards have not been lowered, and each Ranger Course graduate meets the same training standards,\" an Army official told CBS News.",
      "The Pentagon's review could lead to a change in the Army Combat Fitness test, the generic test, so that the requirements are the same for men and women.",
      "Currently, the Army Combat Fitness test is scored based on different requirements for men and women, depending on age. For instance, a man who's 17 to 21 years of age must at a minimum be able to run two miles in 22 minutes, while a woman would need to run the same distance in 23:22. The minimum requirement for hand-release push-ups \u2014 which involve lifting your hands off the ground at the bottom of the push-up \u2014 is the same for men and women of any age: 10.",
      "Facing a recruiting crisis, services in recent years have offered adjustments on drug and tattoo policies and provided enlistment bonuses to attract potential service members, while still maintaining physical and educational standards. The Army also launched pre-enlistment boot camps to help potential candidates get into shape before going into basic training.",
      "Hegseth said during his confirmation hearing that while writing his book \"War on Warriors,\" he spoke to service members who told him that \"in ways direct, indirect, overt and subtle\" standards have changed, but Hegseth didn't provide senators with concrete examples.",
      "Kuzminski also said the defense secretary's review could include revisiting grooming standards, like the Army allowing women to\u00a0wear ponytails or the Navy permitting some men to grow\u00a0facial hair, due to a medical condition exacerbated by shaving.",
      "\"They seem like little things, but they were also tied to a broader initiative during the Biden administration to ensure that there weren't any standards that were disproportionately affecting minorities,\" Kuzminski said.",
      "Kuzminski added that changing those back may have some impact on recruiting or retention, but \"it's not something that's going to break the force because the objective of every person in uniform is professionalism, and they will follow through the standard, whatever the standard is.\"",

      "Last month, the agency said it aims to cut the size of its workforce by 7,000 people, focusing on workers and jobs that don't \"provide mission critical services.\"",
      "Former SSA Commissioner Martin O'Malley, who led the agency under the Biden administration from December 2023 to November 2024, expects the actual number to be closer to 10,000 workers. The agency currently employs roughly 57,000 people.",
      "\"Everybody who can is going to take that early out, but I think that 7,000 number is conservative,\" O'Malley said Thursday at a panel discussion on recent changes at the agency and how they could affect customer service, held by the National Academy of Social Insurance (NASI), a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization.",
      "\"They are all going to take it,\" he said, adding that employees who choose to stay, will risk losing their jobs without a bonus.",
      "\"They are communicating to people if you don't take the cash and get out now, you are taking the chance of being fired and playing the game of Russian Roulette that follows,\" said O'Malley, who believes the changes being implemented at the agency will \"cause a total system collapse of social security.\"",
      "The amount of the SSA incentive payments being offered individual workers depends on the employee's classification, or where they stand on the federal payscale. The highest-tier worker would receive a maximum of $25,000.",

      "In the past, attempts made by adversaries to access proprietary information \"have been consistently thwarted\" with staff in place to safeguard data, Astrue noted. \"It is a daunting thing to imagine what a foreign power might do with broad access to this kind of data.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday asked the Supreme Court to limit for now the scope of three lower court orders that broadly blocked enforcement of his executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship.",
      "The Trump administration asked the high court for emergency relief in three separate requests, which arise out of cases brought in Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington state. In all three disputes, U.S. district court judges issued orders blocking nationwide enforcement of Mr. Trump's executive order, which was issued his first day in office.",
      "Acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris is now asking the high court to limit the sweep of those orders to cover only those individuals who are directly involved in the cases.",
      "\"These cases \u2014 which involve challenges to the president's January 20, 2025 Executive Order concerning birthright citizenship \u2014 raise important constitutional questions with major ramifications for securing the border,\" she wrote in the requests. \"But at this stage, the government comes to this court with a 'modest' request: while the parties litigate weighty merits questions, the court should 'restrict the scope' of multiple preliminary injunctions that 'purpor[t] to cover every person in the country,' limiting those injunctions to parties actually within the courts' power.\"",
      "Trump's birthright citizenship order",
      "Mr. Trump issued his executive order seeking to terminate birthright citizenship on his first day in office, part of a broad, long-promised crackdown on illegal immigration across the U.S.-Mexico border. The order denies U.S. citizenship to children born to mothers who are in the country unlawfully or temporarily on visas, and whose fathers are neither citizens nor lawful permanent residents.",
      "The president's executive action sparked immediate legal challenges, including in the cases that have now arrived at the Supreme Court. The challengers all argue Mr. Trump's order violates the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment.",
      "Four U.S. district judges \u2014 in Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Washington \u2014 issued orders blocking enforcement of the president's attempt to end birthright citizenship. Efforts by the Trump administration to have U.S. appeals courts restrict the scope of three of those decisions to apply only the parties \u2014 which include 22 states, members of two organizations and seven individuals \u2014 while legal proceedings move forward have not been successful.",
      "In its request to the Supreme Court, the Trump administration said it should clear the way for the president's birthright citizenship order to partially take effect. Harris, who represents the federal government before the court, largely criticized the scope of the relief \u2014 which extends nationwide \u2014 and warned that these injunctions harm the executive branch's ability to carry out its functions.",
      "\"District courts have issued more universal injunctions and [temporary restraining orders] during February 2025 alone than through the first three years of the Biden administration,\" she wrote. \"That sharp rise in universal injunctions stops the executive branch from performing its constitutional functions before any courts fully examine the merits of those actions, and threatens to swamp this court's emergency docket.\"",
      "She noted that the decisions arising out of challenges to Mr. Trump's birthright citizenship order cover all 50 states and \"millions of aliens across the country.\"",
      "\"This court should declare that enough is enough before district courts' burgeoning reliance on universal injunctions becomes further entrenched,\" the acting solicitor general wrote.",
      "On the issue of immigration, specifically, Harris said the lower court orders impede the president's efforts to address what she said is a crisis at the southern border.",
      "\"The district courts' universal injunctions threaten to perpetuate those problems by holding out a nationwide incentive for illegal immigration: the prospect of American citizenship for the unlawful migrants' children and of derivative immigration benefits for the migrants themselves,\" she argued.",
      "Republicans and Democrats alike have sought these nationwide orders when challenging the policies of a president from the opposing political party, and decisions granting that broad relief have been criticized by administrations on both sides of the political spectrum.",
      "Even several members of the Supreme Court have expressed concern about the soundness of these broad orders, which bar the government from enforcing the policy at issue against anyone, anywhere in the country. In a\u00a02018 concurring opinion\u00a0in a\u00a0case involving Mr. Trump's travel ban\u00a0issued during his first term, Justice Clarence Thomas noted that district courts in Hawaii and Maryland entered preliminary injunctions that barred the Trump administration from enforcing the policy, and said he was skeptical they have the authority to do so.",

      "Those who glance up at the sky tonight will have an opportunity to catch the March 2025 \"Blood Moon,\" a phenomenon that colors the full moon in shades of red, orange and yellow during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "This month's full moon is due to pass through the shadow of Earth either late tonight, March 13, or very early tomorrow morning, March 14, depending on the viewer's time zone. It should be visible to people in the Americas and elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere.",
      "Dubbed the \"Worm Moon\" by the Farmer's Almanac, which has been assigning names to full moons for almost a century, this one is expected to start taking shape Wednesday evening and is supposed to last through Saturday morning, according to NASA. The full moon will technically rise in its totality early Friday.",
      "Here's what to know about the event \u2014 and why the moon will bear a new hue when it happens.",
      "Why will the moon be red, orange and yellow tonight?",
      "The moon will appear to turn red late tonight or early tomorrow morning, depending on skywatchers' locations, as Earth passes directly between it and the sun in what's known as a total lunar eclipse. Their perfect alignment darkens the moon, from the perspective of folks looking up, because our planet's position blocks most sunlight from reaching it.",
      "Some light still makes its way to the moon's surface, but only certain shades of it. The colors that wind up there are longer wavelengths of light \u2014 red, orange, yellow \u2014 which withstood the journey through \"a thick slice of Earth's atmosphere,\" NASA said.",
      "Shorter wavelengths of the color spectrum, like blue, scatter easily when they hit the atmosphere. That's why a vast sky can look blue in the middle of the day, when sunlight can shine straight down from overhead. Longer wavelengths materialize on Earth when sunlight hits from more of a perpendicular angle, so its route through our atmosphere can be more extensive. Short wavelengths are essentially filtered out by the atmosphere over such a protracted distance, and only the longer reds, oranges and yellows remain.",
      "What is a \"Blood Moon\"?",
      "\"Blood Moon\" is a nickname that refers to the moon's reddish appearance during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "The full moon will take on several shades of red, orange and yellow when it's nearer the outer edges of Earth's shadow \u2014 when it first intersects with the path of Earth's shadow, for example, and as it's on its way out. But shades of deep red will become more pronounced as the moon enters the darkest part of the shadow.",
      "What exactly causes a \"Blood Moon\"?",
      "A \"Blood Moon\" happens during a total lunar eclipse, when the sun, Earth and the moon align in that order. Long wavelengths of sunlight are refracted through Earth's atmosphere before reaching the moon, which reflects them in reddish hues that may resemble the color of blood.",
      "How to see the \"Blood Moon\" lunar eclipse",
      "The upcoming \"Blood Moon\" will begin before the full moon reaches its brightness point tonight.",
      "As the lunar eclipse gets underway, the moon will start moving through Earth's shadow at 11:57 p.m. EDT. It will become steadily dimmer over the next several hours as it travels toward the darkest part of the shadow and, eventually, appear fully darkened from around 2:26 p.m. to 3:31 a.m. in the early hours of Friday. The most ideal opportunity to see the reddish moon is during the minutes leading up to 3 a.m. EDT, as the moon should be situated in the center of Earth's shadow around then.",

      "Weldon, a vaccine critic, was set to appear before the Senate's health committee on Thursday for his confirmation hearing, and news of the withdrawal of his nomination came less than an hour before the hearing was to begin. Axios first reported news of Weldon's nomination being pulled.",
      "The committee was expected to question him about his long record of criticizing vaccines and the agency he was nominated to lead. Weldon is a physician and a former Republican member of Congress.",
      "In a statement obtained by CBS News, Weldon said that Health and Human Services Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u00a0was \"very upset\" at his nomination being pulled. Weldon said he had received a call from the White House 12 hours before the scheduled hearing, informing him that the nomination would be withdrawn.",
      "\"Bobby Kennedy is a good man who really is passionate about improving the health of the American people,\" Weldon said. \"President Trump did a good thing in making him secretary of HHS.  Hopefully they can find someone for CDC who can survive the confirmation process and get past pharma and find some answers.\"",
      "Weldon said that Maine Sen. Susan Collins had told Kennedy she had reservations about his nomination and said the Republican senator's staff had been \"very hostile\" in a meeting with him.",

      "\"I did not express concerns to the White House. I had some reservations, but I certainly had not reached a final judgment,\" Collins said.",
      "Multiple people familiar with Weldon's Senate meetings said Republicans had been concerned over his answers when asked about his priorities for the agency. Weldon wanted to detail his priorities for the CDC after being confirmed and learning more about the agency as director.",
      "Weldon was unfamiliar with the CDC's current budget and workforce, telling congressional staffers he was busy with his medical practice and did not want to waste time reading up on an agency he might not be confirmed to lead, they said.",
      "Two people said Collins' staff had only asked Weldon how he would address the perception that he was against vaccines, but denied accusing him of being \"anti-vaccine.\"",
      "Weldon said that over 20 years ago, while in Congress, he raised concerns about childhood vaccine safety, and \"for some reason Collins staff suddenly couldn't get over that.\"",
      "He also claimed that another senator, Louisiana Republican Dr. Bill Cassidy, had also said he was anti-vaccine and had once asked for his nomination to be withdrawn.",
      "A spokesperson for Cassidy denied that he had asked the White House for Weldon's nomination to be withdrawn. Cassidy had been \"looking forward\" to Thursday's hearing with Weldon, the spokesperson said.",
      "The CDC has faced mounting questions from senators in recent weeks over moves to reopen studies into whether vaccines are linked to autism and also over an abruptly canceled meeting of the agency's outside immunization advisers, which has yet to be rescheduled.",
      "Kennedy has also faced criticism this week for inflating the risks of measles vaccines when discussing the\u00a0record outbreak\u00a0in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. Kennedy, whose department oversees the CDC, also has a history of\u00a0criticizing vaccines.",
      "After a meeting with Sen. Patty Murray last month, the Washington Democrat said she was \"deeply disturbed to hear Dr. Weldon repeat debunked claims about vaccines.\"",
      "\"As we face one of the worst measles outbreaks in years thanks to President Trump, a vaccine skeptic who spent years spreading lies about safe and proven vaccines should never have even been under consideration to lead the foremost agency charged with protecting public health,\" Murray said in a statement Thursday.",

      "The lift, known as the Triple Chair, was stopped after the accident, Red Lodge Mountain spokesperson Troy Hawks said. More than 100 people who were on it at the time were evacuated by ski patrollers who used ropes to lower them to the ground.",
      "Hawks said the lift had a mechanical problem at the time Zinne fell, but declined to comment further and said the circumstances were being investigated. Weather conditions and the victim's actions also were being looked at, he said.",
      "On the morning of the accident, some other chairlifts at Red Lodge Mountain were not operating because of high winds. Wind gusts of about 50 miles per hour were recorded in the area shortly before and after the accident, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "Hawks said the Triple Chairlift, which is almost a mile long and was built in 1983, was operating within safety parameters. It will remain shut down until an engineer fully assesses it, he said.",
      "Staff at the ski area inspect its chairlifts daily, Hawks said. A professional inspection is conducted annually as required by Red Lodge Mountain's insurance carrier and the U.S. Forest Service, which leases land to the ski area, he said.",
      "\"We place a top priority on the safety of all of our lifts and lift operations, and perform daily, weekly, monthly, and annual safety measures to better ensure the safe operation of our lifts,\" the resort said in a statement\u00a0on social media.",
      "A GoFundMe page for Zinne described him as a \"devoted husband\" to his wife and a \"caring father\" to his two-year-old son.",
      "\"This unexpected loss has left his family, friends, and all who knew him heartbroken and in disbelief,\" the GoFundMe said.",
      "Fatal lift accidents at ski areas are relatively rare, according to the National Ski Areas Association. Between 1956 and 2024, 35 people died in accidents involving chairlifts and aerial ropeways. Sixteen of the deaths were linked to mechanical malfunctions, according to data collected by the group.",
      "The latest death during that time period was in 2020, when a man died at\u00a0Colorado's Vail resort\u00a0after his clothing got entangled in part of the chairlift, making him unable to breathe.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump is planning to invoke a wartime law known as the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 as soon as Friday to authorize the summary deportation of some migrants, including to Guantanamo Bay, escalating his government-wide immigration crackdown, multiple U.S. officials familiar with the plan told CBS News.",
      "The 227-year-old law\u00a0gives presidents the extraordinary power to order the arrest, detention and deportation of noncitizens who are 14 years or older and come from countries staging an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" of the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to cite the 18th-century statute to order the swift detention and deportation of suspected members of the Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang with prison origins that his administration has designated a foreign terrorist organization, said the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.",
      "Officials have made preparations to send suspected gang members to the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, soon after Mr. Trump invokes the Alien Enemies Act, two of the U.S. officials said. At Mr. Trump's direction, officials have been detaining some migrants awaiting deportation at the naval base, though the holding facilities were left empty earlier this week.",
      "Those subject to the Alien Enemies Act would not be allowed to have a court hearing or an asylum interview since they would be processed under an emergency, wartime authority \u2014 not immigration law. Instead, they would be eligible to be detained and deported, with little to no due process, under Title 50, the section of the U.S. code housing America's war and defense laws.",
      "CNN first reported Mr. Trump's plans to invoke the law as early as Friday.",
      "The Alien Enemies Act has been invoked only a few times in U.S. history, including during World War II, when the government used it to surveil and detain Italian, German and Japanese immigrants in the U.S.",
      "Its invocation to target migrants from countries with which the U.S. is not actively at war is almost certain to face legal challenges.",
      "Mr. Trump previewed his invocation of the Alien Enemies Act in an executive order issued on his first day back at the White House. It directed the secretaries of state and homeland security to plan for the potential invocation of the law and prepare facilities \"necessary to expedite the removal\" of those subject to it.",
      "\"By invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil, including our cities and inner cities,\" Mr. Trump said in his inaugural address.",

      "Washington \u2014 Irish Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin said he hopes dialogue can resolve the trade war between the U.S. and the European Union after President Trump Thursday threatened to impose 200% retaliatory tariffs on European wines and alcohols.",
      "The tariffs were a response to the European Union's counter-tariffs against Mr. Trump's initial steel and aluminum hikes.",
      "\"I think it's a lot of uncertainty at the moment,\" Martin said in an interview with CBS News on Thursday. \"Overall, tariffs are damaging to trade, damaging to businesses, but also damaging to consumers, because they will lead to an increase in prices for consumers. I don't think that's good, either way. So, we would hope that in the fullness of time that these things will settle down and that there would be negotiation, trade negotiations, to arrive at a landing zone that people can cope with and can accommodate.\"",

    "summary": "Russia's Vladimir Putin said he agrees in principle with a U.S. proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, but that the terms need to be worked out.",
    "story": [
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that he agrees in principle with a U.S. proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, but that the terms need to be worked out, and he emphasized that it should pave the way to lasting peace.",
      "\"The idea itself is correct, and we certainly support it,\" Putin said during a news conference in Moscow.",
      "\"But there are issues that we need to discuss, and I think that we need to discuss it with our American colleagues and partners,\" he said, adding that he could discuss those details in another phone conversation with President Trump.",
      "Putin noted that Ukrainian troops are encircled in their last foothold in Russia's Kursk region, and said it would be necessary to determine before a ceasefire whether they will lay down weapons and surrender. He also noted the need to develop a mechanism to control possible breaches of the truce, though the Kremlin has repeatedly ruled out Western troops being deployed to Ukraine as peacekeepers.",
      "\"We agree with the proposals to halt the fighting, but we proceed from the assumption that the ceasefire should lead to lasting peace and remove the root causes of the crisis,\" said Putin, who has always blamed the war and his full-scale invasion that sparked it on Ukraine.",
      "He said that while the U.S. had apparently persuaded Ukraine to accept a ceasefire, Kyiv was interested in a truce because of the battlefield situation.",
      "\"In these conditions, I believe it would be good for the Ukrainian side to secure a ceasefire for at least 30 days,\" he said.",
      "Putin spoke hours after a senior U.S. envoy arrived in Moscow to discuss the U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire, and less than a day after he made a first visit to his commanders in Kursk, wearing military fatigues and promising the full recapture of the region.",
      "On Wednesday, a U.S. official confirmed to CBS News that Russian troops had made \"significant gains\" in Kursk over the past week. Russia has been maneuvering to surround the Ukrainian forces who launched a surprise incursion into Kursk months ago, and they have succeeded in doing so to the extent that the Ukrainians will likely soon have to decide whether to withdraw back into Ukraine, or be cut off from their supply lines, the American official told CBS News a day before Putin made essentially the same assertion.",
      "The renewed Russian military push and Putin's high-profile visit to his troops in Kursk came amid Mr. Trump's push for a rapid diplomatic end to the war sparked by Russia's full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. The U.S. on Tuesday lifted its March 3 suspension of military aid and intelligence sharing for Kyiv after senior U.S. and Ukrainian officials made progress on how to stop the fighting during talks held in Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"It's up to Russia now,\" Mr. Trump said Wednesday, as his administration presses Moscow to agree to the ceasefire. The U.S. president has made veiled threats to hit Russia with new sanctions if it refuses to engage with his peace efforts, saying Wednesday that, \"in a financial sense, we could do things very bad for Russia. It would be devastating for Russia. But I don't want to do that because I want to see peace.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that Mr. Trump's special envoy for Russia and Ukraine, Steve Witkoff, was heading to Moscow for talks with Russian officials, possibly including Putin. His plane touched down in Moscow on Thursday morning, but his schedule was not revealed.",
      "Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said after meeting Thursday with U.S. national security adviser Mike Waltz, who was with Witkoff in Moscow, that the U.S. proposal for a one-month ceasefire failed to take into account Russia's position, and would need reworking, according to Russian media.",
      "\"The document, it seems to me, has a hasty character,\" Ushakov said, according to Russia's state-run RIA news agency \"Itwill be necessary to work, think and take into account our position, too. It outlines only the Ukrainian approach.\"",
      "The Kremlin has repeatedly ruled out accepting any agreement that sees Western forces deployed in Ukraine to help maintain a peace, something many European nations have said will be needed, though only Britain and France have suggested any willingness to do so.",
      "By signaling its openness to a ceasefire, Ukraine has presented the Kremlin with a dilemma at a time when the Russian military has the upper hand in the war \u2014 whether to accept a truce and abandon hopes of making new gains, or reject the offer and risk derailing a cautious rapprochement with Washington.",
      "The Ukrainian army's foothold inside Russia has been under intense pressure for months from a renewed effort by Russian forces, backed by North Korean troops. Ukraine's daring incursion last August led to the first occupation of Russian soil by foreign troops since World War II and embarrassed the Kremlin.",
      "But given the recent Russian advances, Putin did not look like a man who was interested in ordering his forces to lay down their weapons on Wednesday as he visited troops in Kursk, wearing military fatigues and talking strategy with his commanders. He said he expected the military \"to completely free the Kursk region from the enemy in the nearest future.\"",
      "Putin added that going forward, \"it's necessary to think about creating a security zone alongside the state border,\" in a signal that Moscow could try to expand its territorial gains by capturing parts of Ukraine's neighboring Sumy region. That idea could complicate a ceasefire deal.",
      "Ukraine launched the summer raid into Kursk in a bid to counter the increasingly glum news from the front line, as well as to draw Russian troops away from the battlefield inside Ukraine and gain a bargaining chip in any peace talks. But the incursion failed to significantly change the dynamic of the war.",
      "Ukraine's top military head, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, said late Wednesday that Russian aviation had carried out an unprecedented number of strikes on Kursk and that as a result Sudzha had been almost completely destroyed. He did not comment on whether Ukraine still controlled the settlement but said it was \"maneuvering (troops) to more advantageous lines.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Major General Dmytro Krasylnykov, commander of Ukraine's Northern Operational Command, which includes the Kursk region, was dismissed from his post, he told Ukrainian media outlet Suspilne on Wednesday. He told the outlet he was not given a reason for his dismissal, saying \"I'm guessing, but I don't want to talk about it yet.\"",

      "Those who glance up at the sky tonight will have an opportunity to catch the March 2025 \"Blood Moon,\" a phenomenon that colors the full moon in shades of red, orange and yellow during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "This month's full moon is due to pass through the shadow of Earth either late tonight, March 13, or very early tomorrow morning, March 14, depending on the viewer's time zone. It should be visible to people in the Americas and elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere.",
      "Dubbed the \"Worm Moon\" by the Farmer's Almanac, which has been assigning names to full moons for almost a century, this one is expected to start taking shape Wednesday evening and is supposed to last through Saturday morning, according to NASA. The full moon will technically rise in its totality early Friday.",
      "Here's what to know about the event \u2014 and why the moon will bear a new hue when it happens.",
      "Why will the moon be red, orange and yellow tonight?",
      "The moon will appear to turn red late tonight or early tomorrow morning, depending on skywatchers' locations, as Earth passes directly between it and the sun in what's known as a total lunar eclipse. Their perfect alignment darkens the moon, from the perspective of folks looking up, because our planet's position blocks most sunlight from reaching it.",
      "Some light still makes its way to the moon's surface, but only certain shades of it. The colors that wind up there are longer wavelengths of light \u2014 red, orange, yellow \u2014 which withstood the journey through \"a thick slice of Earth's atmosphere,\" NASA said.",
      "Shorter wavelengths of the color spectrum, like blue, scatter easily when they hit the atmosphere. That's why a vast sky can look blue in the middle of the day, when sunlight can shine straight down from overhead. Longer wavelengths materialize on Earth when sunlight hits from more of a perpendicular angle, so its route through our atmosphere can be more extensive. Short wavelengths are essentially filtered out by the atmosphere over such a protracted distance, and only the longer reds, oranges and yellows remain.",
      "What is a \"Blood Moon\"?",
      "\"Blood Moon\" is a nickname that refers to the moon's reddish appearance during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "The full moon will take on several shades of red, orange and yellow when it's nearer the outer edges of Earth's shadow \u2014 when it first intersects with the path of Earth's shadow, for example, and as it's on its way out. But shades of deep red will become more pronounced as the moon enters the darkest part of the shadow.",
      "What exactly causes a \"Blood Moon\"?",
      "A \"Blood Moon\" happens during a total lunar eclipse, when the sun, Earth and the moon align in that order. Long wavelengths of sunlight are refracted through Earth's atmosphere before reaching the moon, which reflects them in reddish hues that may resemble the color of blood.",
      "How to see the \"Blood Moon\" lunar eclipse",
      "The upcoming \"Blood Moon\" will begin before the full moon reaches its brightness point tonight.",
      "As the lunar eclipse gets underway, the moon will start moving through Earth's shadow at 11:57 p.m. EDT. It will become steadily dimmer over the next several hours as it travels toward the darkest part of the shadow and, eventually, appear fully darkened from around 2:26 p.m. to 3:31 a.m. in the early hours of Friday. The most ideal opportunity to see the reddish moon is during the minutes leading up to 3 a.m. EDT, as the moon should be situated in the center of Earth's shadow around then.",

    "summary": "Along with Arab nations backing an alternative to Trump's \"Riviera of the Mideast\" proposal, Hamas also cautiously welcomed his sharp change in rhetoric.",
    "story": [
      "During a meeting on Wednesday with Ireland's leader Michel Martin, President Trump made an offhand remark that was quickly picked up in the Middle East as a major change in his stance on the war-torn Gaza Strip and its roughly 2 million Palestinian inhabitants.",
      "\"Nobody is expelling any Palestinians,\" Mr. Trump told reporters.",
      "That came after he repeatedly said that under his own proposal to rebuild Gaza, all of its residents would be moved out, while the U.S. moved in to \"take over\" the coastal territory to turn it into a luxury real estate development. Just a month ago, Mr. Trump was clear that, in his mind, not only would Palestinians need to leave Gaza, they would not be permitted to return.",
      "That plan was roundly and clearly rejected by Arab countries, including Egypt and Jordan, which Mr. Trump had said would take in the displaced masses.",
      "Egypt, which has led efforts to present an alternative plan for Gaza that does not involve displacing Palestinians, welcomed the change in tone by Mr. Trump.",
      "\"Egypt expresses its appreciation for the statements made by U.S. President, Donald Trump\u2026 regarding the non-displacement of the residents of the Gaza Strip,\" the Egyptian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Thursday. \"Egypt affirms that this position reflects an understanding of the importance of avoiding further deterioration of the humanitarian situation in the Strip and the necessity of working towards finding just and sustainable solutions to the Palestinian cause.\"",
      "Hamas, the U.S. and Israeli designated terrorist organization that sparked the war in Gaza with its brutal Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel, also cautiously welcomed the shift in Mr. Trump's rhetoric.",
      "\"If Trump's statements represent a retreat from the idea of Palestinian displacement, then they are welcomed,\" a statement from the group's spokesperson said.",
      "Mr. Trump's remarks came Wednesday after his senior envoy Steve Witkoff met with the foreign ministers of five Arab nations in Qatar to discuss Gaza's post-war future. That future, regardless of what reconstruction plan is eventually implemented, can only start taking shape once there is an official end to the war, however.",
      "A fragile truce between Israel and Hamas has largely kept the peace since January 19, but the two sides have not yet agreed on whether to extend the first phase of the agreement, or to move onto a second phase as originally envisioned. The dialogue in Doha, Qatar, involving delegations from the host-nation as well as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Jordan and the U.S. is aimed at pushing the process forward \u2013 and keeping the guns silent in Gaza.",
      "The five Arab nations involved have pushed the Egyptian-crafted alternative to Mr. Trump's \"Riviera of the Mideast\" proposal in their talks with American officials.",
      "The Arab plan, the rough outline of which officials shared with CBS News earlier this month, carries a price tag of $53 billion and envisions all of the enclave's residents remaining in Gaza throughout the years-long reconstruction. The Trump administration initially rejected the plan, with U.S. National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes issuing a statement saying it failed to \" address the reality that Gaza is currently uninhabitable and residents cannot humanely live in a territory covered in debris and unexploded ordnance.\"",
      "\"President Trump stands by his vision to rebuild Gaza free from Hamas,\" Hughes said at the time, adding: \"We look forward to further talks to bring peace and prosperity to the region.\"",
      "It appeared on Wednesday, with Mr. Trump's remarks at the White House, that those further talks with America's regional partners may have convinced the White House that displacing the entire population of Gaza was not a tenable proposition.",
      "\"The Arab foreign ministers presented the Gaza reconstruction plan, which was approved at the Arab Summit held in Cairo on March 4, 2025,\" the five Arab nations that met in Doha said in a joint statement shared Wednesday. \"They also agreed with the U.S. envoy to continue consultations and coordination on this plan as a basis for the reconstruction efforts in the sector.\"",
      "That Egyptian plan has been adopted by the broad Muslim solidarity group of 57 countries known as the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. It envisions the Gaza Strip eventually being run by the Palestinian Authority, which currently administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, not by Hamas.",
      "That will likely prove an ongoing point of contention as the PA holds little support among Palestinians and has been dismissed as a potential future Gaza administrator by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, showing there's still much negotiation ahead if Mr. Trump is to make good on his vows to end the crisis in the heart of the Middle East.",

    "summary": "New species of shark, sea butterfly, mud dragon, bamboo coral, water bear, octocoral, and shrimp were just some of the marine life findings.",
    "story": [
      "Over 800 marine species were newly discovered after two years of collaborative efforts by scientists, governments, museums and others participating in the Ocean Census, a global alliance founded to accelerate the discovery of marine life.",
      "New species of shark, sea butterfly, mud dragon, bamboo coral, water bear, octocoral, and shrimp were just some of the findings that were registered in a directory after the collaborative conducted 10 global expeditions and hosted eight Species Discovery Workshops.",
      "\"The past two years have been transformative for the Ocean Census: we've pioneered new methods, forged key partnerships, established a global network of participating scientists, and overcome the hurdles of a truly global mission,\" said Oliver Steeds, director of the Ocean Census,\u00a0in a statement.",
      "While oceans cover most of our planet, not much has been done to protect its biodiversity, manage the conservation of ocean life and establish marine protected areas in the high seas. United Nations members\u00a0agreed on a unified treaty\u00a0in 2023 to protect biodiversity in the high seas. More than 100 nations, including the United States, have agreed to protect 30% of the world's oceans by 2030.",
      "\"The ocean covers 71% of our planet, yet it is said that only around 10% of marine life has been discovered so far,\" Dr. Michelle Taylor, principal investigator for Ocean Census,\u00a0said.",
      "The alliance was founded by Nippon Foundation and Nekton in April 2023; about 400 institutions participate in its activities, and 93 scientists were funded to participate in expeditions and research projects in an effort to speed up the identification and official registration of a new species, the Ocean Census\u00a0said\u00a0on its website. The process can take up to 13.5 years, some species may go extinct before they are even documented.",
      "Dave Ebert of the Pacific Shark Research Institute said in a video that knowing we have another new species, \"We can develop conservation methods for it - if it needs it.\"",
      "The recent flurry of expeditions launched by the Ocean Census used divers, submersibles and deep-sea robots up to 5000 meters below sea level to discover new species. The species were analyzed and confirmed in dozens of global laboratories.",
      "Some of the species discovered include:",
      "Guitar Shark",
      "Ebert, also known as the \"Lost Shark Guy,\" identified the guitar shark at 200m depths off Mozambique and Tanzania in Africa. This shark has 38 known species across the globe and shares characteristics of both sharks and rays. The guitar shark family is among the top 10 most threatened vertebrate groups and two-thirds are threatened.",
      "Turridrupa sp Gastropod",
      "Discovered 380 - 400m in the waters of New Caledonia and Vanuatu, in the South Pacific, this predator is one of 100 newly identified turrid gastropods. These deep-sea snails inject toxins into their prey with precision with venomous, harpoon-like teeth.",
      "Sea Star: Tylaster sp.",
      "Found at 2770m to 3575m in the Arctic's J\u00f8tul Vent Field, east of Greenland, this is the second species recorded for this genus, with the first one cited in the Norwegian Sea at 1100 m back in 1881.",

    "summary": "More than 40,000 Afghans approved for travel after helping the U.S. are stuck in limbo.",
    "story": [
      "In August 2021, Tamim Satari raced to the Kabul International Airport to evacuate Afghanistan after working with the American military as an intelligence officer, helping U.S. forces coordinate aerial bomb campaigns against the Taliban. But in the chaos of the U.S. withdrawal, his wife and newborn son were left behind.",
      "\"It was so hard, and we didn't want to lose our small son,\" Satari said.",
      "He was not alone. Thousands of Afghan families were separated in the rushed withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. Babies were passed across throngs of people and over fences, and families scrambled to get through the gates to the airport.",
      "Three years later, more than 10,000 families remain separated, according to Shawn VanDiver, the founder of #AfghanEvac, a nonprofit that worked with the State Department to create a path to reunite separated Afghan families.",
      "\"There's all these moms or dads or young children who are stuck here without their family,\" said VanDiver. \"These people are in danger because of us. And the least we can do is help them reunite.\"",
      "He says the number of children separated from their parents includes 2,800 unaccompanied refugee minors \u2014 children who made it to the U.S. but whose parents did not, or who were left behind as their parents fled.",
      "VanDiver works with the Office of the Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts, known as CARE, a State Department program that was established to assist wartime Afghan allies immigrate to the U.S.",
      "Since 2021, the CARE program has facilitated travel for nearly 200,000 Afghans, according to documents reviewed by CBS News.",
      "This includes those with special immigrant visas who were wartime allies typically paid by the U.S. government. It also includes Afghan refugees who assisted the U.S. mission in military roles, as civil society members, or those who are family members of those who served.",
      "\"The truth is, is that every single person in the refugee pipeline and every single person in the [special immigrant visa] pipeline are somebody who took action in our name and are now in danger,\" said VanDiver.",
      "\"And these Afghans deserve everything that we can give to them because they protected us.\"",
      "After trying unsuccessfully to bring his wife and son over on his own, Satari connected with CARE in 2023 to get help facilitating their visa process. His wife, Shiba, and their son had escaped to Pakistan after she was threatened by the Taliban for continuing her work as a midwife while her husband was in the U.S.",
      "On Jan. 18, the weekend before President Trump's inauguration, Shiba and her son were flown to JFK airport in New York and then driven to Newark, New Jersey, for an emotional reunion with her husband. Tamim had not seen his son, now nearly 4 years old, since he was a newborn.",
      "The Sataris' family reunion at Newark Liberty International Airport was one of the last refugee reunions to take place.",
      "Three days later, Mr. Trump signed an executive order suspending the U.S. refugee program, stating \"the United States lacks the ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees, into its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans that protects their safety and security, and that ensures the appropriate assimilation of refugees.\"",
      "A federal judge ordered the administration to stop the ban, but since then normal refugee processing has not continued. In a recent court filing, lawyers for the administration said it would\u00a0 take time to restart refugee programs, since agencies have already cut contracts, reduced the workforce and frozen funding.",
      "In addition to Mr. Trump's executive order, Secretary of State Marco Rubio froze all federal funding for the programs that were providing travel for Afghans who had already been approved to resettle in the U.S. This means that anyone vetted and approved for travel \u2014 including those already holding special immigrant visas \u2014 cannot leave Afghanistan unless they are able to pay for the trip themselves.",
      "According to government documents reviewed by CBS, more than 40,000 Afghans who have been vetted and approved to leave Afghanistan are now in limbo, with their lives at stake.",
      "\"I've heard countless horror stories of torture and murder of these allies of the United States,\" said Republican Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, who voted for the CARE program.",
      "\"I would urge the administration to take a look at this and to honor the commitment that we made to [our allies], and not break our promise, but let them know that we are going to protect them.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump and other Republican lawmakers have expressed concern that allowing Afghans into the U.S. makes the country more vulnerable to terrorism.",
      "McCaul and others who advocate for the program say the vetting is already extremely effective.",
      "\"You want to vet them again? Go ahead. But they've already been vetted, and probably the most thorough vetting in American history,\" McCaul told CBS News.",
      "Afghans who come to the U.S are reviewed by the State Department, Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. They go through several in-person interviews and their biometrics are checked against government databases, in addition to extensive medical screening.",
      "\"Afghans who come to this country via the CARE program are the most vetted immigrant population in our country's history,\" said a former State Department official.",
      "Satari remains hopeful he will not be one of the last to be reunited with his family. He has settled in New Jersey and is employed in a mechanical job while he studies for his real estate license.",
      "\"I have a lot of hope in the future. I would like to have a great life,\" Satari said. \"I am responsible for taking care of my son, to enroll in school and start lessons over there. I have a big hope.\"",

    "summary": "The prehistoric facial bones were found buried in 50 feet of mud and silt, and are believed to be 1.1 to 1.4 million years old, researchers said.",
    "story": [
      "Researchers in Spain have unearthed a fossil from a potential new prehistoric member of the human family tree, and they say it's the earliest known remnants of a face discovered in Western Europe.",
      "The facial bones from an adult were found at the Atapuerca archaeological site in northern Spain in 2022. Since then, a team of scientists has been working to learn more about the hominin, whom they nicknamed Pink. The researchers shared their findings in a study in the journal\u00a0Nature, which was published on Tuesday.",
      "Pink's remains have been dated as between 1.1 and 1.4 million years old, the researchers said.",
      "The research \"introduces a new actor in the history of human evolution in Europe,\" study author Rosa Huguet, of Spain's University of Rovira i Virgili, said at a news conference, according to the AFP news agency.",
      "The discovery suggests that early humans settled in Europe, traveling from the east side of the continent to the west, about 1.4 million years ago, the researchers said. Until now, the oldest-known human species in Western Europe was the\u00a0Homo antecessor. Experts have found Homo antecessor remains that are around 850,000 years old.",
      "The oldest human ancestor found in any area of Europe is the Dmanisi people, or Homo georgicus, a group that lived in what is now the nation of Georgia. Remains of that species have been dated back to 1.8 million years ago. They are the first members of the human family known to have traveled from Africa to Europe.",
      "The face of \"Pink\"",
      "The fossilized upper jawbone and partial cheekbone were excavated from a 52-foot-deep layer of silt and mud at Sima del Elefante, or the \"elephant pit,\" a site less than 1,000 feet from where the fossils of\u00a0Homo antecessor were discovered in 1994. The bones were not enough for researchers to determine Pink's age or gender.",
      "From those fossilized bones, researchers were able to use 3D imaging techniques to create a model of Pink's face. The face is more \"projected forward and more robust\" than a modern human face or a\u00a0Homo antecessor face, Maria Martinon-Torres, director of Spain's National Research Center on Human Evolution, told the AFP.",
      "Pink's face bears some similarities to the human ancestor Homo erectus,\u00a0researchers said. That species spanned nearly 2 million years and was the first human species to evolve more familiar human body proportions and use fire and tools. Remains of the species have been found in Africa, Asia and Europe.",
      "But the similarities weren't strong enough for the scientists to confirm that Pink was a member of that species. Instead, they have proposed that Pink could belong to a new possible species, which they called Homo 'affinis' erectus.",
      "\"This is the most honest proposal we can make with the evidence we have,\" Martinon-Torres said, according to AFP.",
      "The scientists were also able to analyze small stone tools and animal bones found at the excavation site to learn more about how Pink lived. The environment at the time was a humid forest landscape, and the early human population lived alongside horses, ancient cattle, monkeys and hippos, the researchers said. The area also likely had plenty of water, which would have made it an \"ideal\" place for the species to settle, Huguet said in the news conference.",
      "The researchers suggested that the species may be a bridge between the\u00a0Homo georgicus species and the\u00a0Homo antecessor species. Study co-author Jose Maria Bermudez de Castro told the AFP that it's likely the species \"probably disappeared\" during a severe global cooling era that occurred nearly 900,000 years ago.",

    "story": [
      "Cairo \u2014\u00a0Sarah al-Awady says she was sitting with her family early on the morning of Oct. 22, 2024, in their tent in Al-Zawaida, the town in the central Gaza Strip where the displaced Palestinians had taken shelter, when she was struck in the head by a bullet fired by an Israeli quadcopter drone.",
      "\"Suddenly I felt pain in my head, like I had been hit with an iron bar or something,\" the 18-year-old Gazan told CBS News this week. \"My family started screaming, 'a bullet, a bullet!' Everyone was panicking and they carried me and rushed me to Shuhada al-Aqsa Hospital.\"",
      "CBS News has asked the Israel Defense Forces about its reported use of small-arms-equipped drones in Gaza, and about al-Awady's claim, specifically, that she was hit by one of the weapons in a camp for displaced civilians. In a statement sent Wednesday, the IDF said it \"follows international law, targeting only military objectives and takes feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm.\"",
      "The military said it could not give details about the various aircraft it uses, \"as they are classified for security reasons, and to avoid compromising the operational capabilities of the IDF,\" and added that it could not provide information about al-Awady's claim without more precise information on the time and location of the shooting.",
      "The doctors did what they could with what little they had amid the devastation in Gaza, just over a year after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack sparked the war in the Palestinian territory. They could see that the bullet was lodged in al-Awady's skull, behind her right eye, but they didn't have the capacity to remove it.",
      "Al-Awady was eventually told there was nothing more the doctors in Gaza could do, but she refused to give up hope and insisted on staying in the hospital. At the very least, she thought, inside the hospital her badly wounded eye would be protected from the dusty conditions in her family's makeshift home.",
      "So she remained, relying on painkillers to cope with the excruciating pain in her head, but without any plan for relief in sight.",
      "In early November, al-Awady was seen by a team of volunteer medics visiting the European Hospital near Khan Younis, in southern Gaza. Dr. Mohamed Tawfik, an Egyptian, was among the volunteers, and when he saw al-Awady, he thought of someone he believed could help.",
      "Tawfik called his father, a veteran ophthalmologist, to get his medical opinion.",
      "Dr. Ahmed Tawfik, the elder doctor, told CBS News he wanted to go to Gaza to try to help the young woman, but the southern Rafah border crossing between the enclave and Egypt was closed.",
      "\"I followed this case almost daily. I felt this was my case,\" Tawfik said.",
      "But he could not find a way to travel to Gaza and, at the time, with the war still raging, Israel was permitting very few people to leave the enclave, even for medical treatment.",
      "The doctor's son returned to Egypt, and al-Awady told CBS News she started giving up hope. For months she said she lived in fear that she would permanently lose sight in her right eye.",
      "\"I applied for treatment abroad, like many others. When people asked me, 'How long have you been waiting?' I'd say a month. They'd tell me, 'Forget it, we've been waiting for so much longer.'\"",
      "A glimmer of hope would finally come, about three months after the bullet lodged in al-Awady's head, with the news that Israel and Hamas had agreed to a ceasefire deal. It came into effect on Jan. 19, 2024, and al-Awady was able to return to her home in the decimated north of Gaza.",
      "She said she was relieved to find her family's home among the few buildings spared from the destruction. She stayed there for a week, until, on the evening of February 8, she received a call from the World Health Organization, telling her she would be leaving the following day for Egypt.",
      "\"There is no electricity, so I literally packed my luggage by candlelight,\" she recalled. Only her mother was permitted to travel with her, but the pair reached Egypt the next day, as planned.",
      "She was sent first to the city of Port Said, on Egypt's Mediterranean coast. A week later, Dr. Tawfik managed to get her moved to the hospital where he works in Al-Sharqia Governorate, in the Nile Delta.",
      "Three teams \u2014 ophthalmology, neurosurgery and radiology \u2014 worked together, debating the best approach to remove the bullet that had been lodged for months right next to al-Awady's optic nerve.",
      "\"We ran several simulations to find the best route to avoid the optic nerve,\" Dr. Mohamed Khaled Shawky, of the Al Nour Radiology Center, told CBS News. He helped guide the surgery remotely via a video link from his workstation at the separate facility.",
      "\"The bullet landed in the best possible place for the patient, but the worst place for a medical team,\" Shawky told CBS News. \"Had it moved a millimeter in any direction, it would have caused great damage.\"",
      "The doctors agreed the best option was to try to reach the bullet by entering through al-Awady's eye socket, to avoid damaging her brain.",
      "Tawfik was direct, telling al-Awady there was a 50% chance of success, a risk of internal bleeding, and she could lose her eye entirely or have her vision severely impaired.",
      "\"I cried. I was very scared, but I prayed and accepted the risk,\" she told CBS News.",
      "\"His amazing medical team tried their best to improve my spirit, to make me psychologically ready, and they did. I entered the operating room laughing and full of joy,\" al-Awady said",
      "The surgery was carried out last week, and it was a success. Tawfik told CBS News he was surprised by the amount of infection and abscess caused by the bullet, which had rusted over time inside al-Awady's head.",
      "Even with the bullet out, al-Awady is not fully out of the woods.",
      "\"Three hours later, I opened my eyes and they told me that, thanks to God, all went well,\" she recalled. \"I started crying again.\"",
      "\"She is very stable now, and she is taking her meds and getting better,\" Tawfik told CBS News. \"My goal was first to end the pain caused by the infection and, second, to preserve her current eyesight level. I am hoping that after we deal with the retinal detachment her sight will improve.\"",
      "The young woman's eye will never look \u2014 or see \u2014 the same way it did before she was shot.",

      "It's a confusing time for American diplomacy. After yesterday's meeting in Saudi Arabia, the U.S. appeared on Tuesday to be back in Ukraine's corner \u2014 and calling on Russia to agree to a 30-day ceasefire in the war it started more than three years ago. It remained entirely unclear on Wednesday, however, whether Vladimir Putin might agree to a temporary ceasefire. His forces currently have the momentum on the battlefield but, like Ukraine, Russia is thought to have suffered hundreds of thousands of military casualties.",
      "\"We're going to tell (the Russians) this is what's on the table. Ukraine is ready to stop shooting and start talking, and now it'll be up to them to say yes or no,\" U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters after the meeting in Jeddah. \"If they say no, then we'll unfortunately know what the impediment is to peace here\u2026 The ball's now in their court.\"",
      "Russia hedges, but notes battlefield \"dynamics are good\" for Putin",
      "The Kremlin said Wednesday that it needed more details on the proposal and time to consider it. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow assumed that Rubio, who led the U.S. delegation at the talks with Ukraine on Tuesday, would be briefing Russian counterparts \"on the details of the negotiations in Saudi Arabia,\" but that before such information was shared, \"Russia does not want to get ahead of itself on the issue of the proposed truce.\"",
      "\"Contacts are planned in the coming days,\" Peskov said.",
      "Mr. Trump's special envoy for Russia and Ukraine, Steve Witkoff, is expected to head to Russia for talks later this week. Peskov indicated those talks could lead to another telephone conversation between Putin and Mr. Trump. He said there were no concrete plans for such a conversation yet, but \"if necessary, [it] can be organized very quickly.\"",
      "The Kremlin spokesman hinted, however, that Russia's bargaining position in any looming ceasefire talks was only getting stronger with every passing day. Putin's forces have continued a slow but steady advance in recent weeks, retaking ground in Russia's western border region of Kursk, where Ukrainian forces staged a shock incursion last year.",
      "\"The Kremlin is closely monitoring information from the military in the Kursk region,\" Peskov said. \"The data shows that Russian forces are advancing successfully, the dynamics are good.\"",
      "Russia's military said Wednesday that forces had retaken five more small villages in Kursk from Ukrainian troops. Russia also unleashed a fresh rocket attack on Ukraine overnight, with the State Emergency Service reporting strikes on Zelenskyy's heavily bombarded hometown of Kryvyi Rih. The service said apartment buildings, administrative buildings, a shop, an educational institution, buses and other vehicles were damaged in the strikes, and it accused Russia of then shelling rescuers who had responded.

      "The White House's shift after the meeting in Saudi Arabia \u2014 clearly putting the onus back on Moscow to end the war that Putin launched more than three years ago \u2014 was the second dramatic turn by the Trump administration in less than a month as it steers America's policy on Ukraine. It stood in stark contrast to the meeting Zelenskyy had just weeks ago in Washington, when Mr. Trump called the elected Ukrainian president \"a dictator,\" said he didn't \"have the cards right now\" to negotiate the terms of a truce, and then publicly berated him in the Oval Office.",
      "Mr. Trump then ordered the suspension of U.S. security assistance and intelligence sharing with Ukraine \u2014 both of which are crucial to the country standing any chance of holding Russia's advancing forces at bay.",
      "The pause was lifted Tuesday upon news of the agreement between Washington and Kyiv on a framework for a 30-day ceasefire, immediately unblocking a consignment of weapons already promised to Kyiv \u2014 roughly $3.8 billion worth of air defense systems, HIMARS rockets, artillery and support for Ukraine's F-16 fighter jets.",
      "In Poland, a U.S. NATO ally that shares a long border with western Ukraine and has staunchly supported Zelenskyy throughout the war, Prime Minister Donald Tusk lauded the \"important step towards peace,\" as the country's defense ministry confirmed the transfer of U.S.-supplied weapons had resumed across the Polish border.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, both of whom have indicated a willingness to send peacekeeping forces to Ukraine as part of any eventual truce deal, both hailed the progress in Jeddah, with Starmer calling it a \"remarkable breakthrough,\" while Macron cautioned that Kyiv would still need \"robust\" security guarantees as part of a ceasefire, to ward off any future Russian aggression.",
      "Rubio, speaking to reporters Wednesday, appeared to add further nuance to the White House's stance on the position of Ukraine and its neighbors, saying European nations would \"have to be involved\" in reaching a ceasefire, and framing the ongoing discussions as being \"about deterrence for Ukraine against future aggression.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and other senior U.S. officials have for weeks played down the importance of security guarantees for Ukraine \u2014 and completely ruled out any suggestion of U.S. boots on the ground. They have insisted that a new economic deal between Kyiv and Washington, aimed at granting U.S. access to Ukraine's reserves of highly-sought after mineral resources, would bring American investment that would effectively deter Russia, without a clear U.S. military commitment.",
      "Rubio said Wednesday, according to the Reuters news agency, that he would not frame a U.S.-Ukraine minerals deal as a deterrent to Russia.",
      "\"There's different ways to construct a deterrent on the ground that prevents another war from starting in the future,\" Rubio said, stressing that the Trump administration wasn't approaching the concept of security guarantees \"with any sort of preconceived notion.\"",
      "\"The bottom line,\" he said, \"is it needs to be something that makes Ukraine feel as if they can deter and prevent a future invasion.\"",
      "During the first three years of war, the U.S. government committed well over $100 billion to support Ukraine, helping defend a young democracy against Russia's aggression.",
      "That cause has drawn many volunteers from around the world to help train and fight alongside Ukraine's forces, including Americans who've come as private citizens, risking their own personal safety. CBS News has met Americans helping train Ukrainian soldiers and evacuating civilians from front-line areas.",
      "It's believed that hundreds of American volunteers, many of them U.S. veterans, have signed up to serve with Ukraine's army. For some of them, the U.S. administration's recent actions and rhetoric \u2014 particularly remarks by Mr. Trump that echoed Kremlin talking points, suggesting the war is Kyiv's fault and that Zelenskyy is an illegitimate leader \u2014 have not sat well.",
      "One American fighting for Ukraine's survival posted a video on social media after that explosive meeting at the White House, describing it in no uncertain terms as \"basically Russian propaganda out of the mouth of an American president.\"",
      "\"It's shameful,\" said the man, who identified himself in the video as \"Nasty,\" an American volunteer fighting with a unit of the Ukrainian National Guard in the Kharkiv region. \"I voted for that man two times. I've always been a diehard Trump supporter, to the point of losing friends over standing up for that man and what he says on TV. But last night he crossed a line.\"",

      "\u200b\"My worst nightmare is to be at a wedding and the DJ puts on the music and the song comes on and suddenly the wedding becomes about me, and people form a circle around me and I become a trained monkey,\" Bacon explained. \"So I\u2019ve gone to the DJs and said, \u2018Please don\u2019t play that song.\u2019 It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like the song.\"",

Although \"Footloose\" features many dance scenes, Bacon admits he \"was not a trained dancer\" going into it.",
      "\"Growing up in Philly, I loved dancing. In [New York], I would go to Studio 54 and dance all night all alone \u2014 and this was when I was a waiter. I always loved it,\" he told the SXSW crowd.",

They had talked about choreographers [and] I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t really need a choreographer. You can just turn the music on, and I can just dance around and have fun with it.\u2019 And they were like, \u2018Ah \u2014 na na na, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting in to.\u2019\"",
      "In April 2024, Bacon returned to the Utah high school where the movie was filmed, following a social media campaign started by the students of Payson High. The campaign included videos of the students re-enacting scenes from the film and posting them online with the hashtag #bacontopayson.",

      "\"We have yet to obtain the data that treating VMS will prevent cognitive decline, but are hopeful that with menopausal hormone therapy and other non-hormonal options, we may be able to obtain this data in the near future.\"",

      "Kurt the CyberGuy explains how to increase your security and privacy through Google Chrome on your devices when browsing the web.",
      "Chrome extensions are incredibly useful, whether you want to block ads, track the best deals or\u00a0enhance your browsing experience. They can be downloaded from the Chrome Web Store, which functions like the Play Store but for extensions. However, extensions are easier to mimic and turn into malicious software compared to apps.",
      "As we just reported, over 3.2 million users were victimized by a security breach tied to\u00a016 malicious browser extensions, highlighting how attackers exploit tools that seem legitimate to spread malware or steal sensitive data.",
      "Now, security researchers have discovered a polymorphic attack that allows malicious Chrome extensions to transform into other browser extensions, including password managers, crypto wallets and banking apps, to steal sensitive information.",
      "Keep reading to learn how this attack works and how to protect yourself from it.",

      "Chrome browser on smartphone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the malicious polymorphic attack works",
      "Security researchers at\u00a0SquareX Labs have found a new attack that lets malicious Chrome extensions disguise themselves as legitimate ones, like password managers, crypto wallets and banking apps, to steal sensitive information. This \"polymorphic\" attack takes advantage of Chrome\u2019s extension system to trick users while staying under the radar.",
      "The attack starts with hackers uploading what looks like a harmless extension to the Chrome Web Store. It might even have real features, like an AI-powered marketing tool, to convince users to install and pin it to their browser.",
      "Once installed, the malicious extension scans the victim\u2019s browser for other extensions. It can do this in two ways. If it has permission to use the \"chrome.management\" API, it grabs a list of installed extensions directly. If not, it injects code into web pages to check for unique files or resources tied to certain extensions.",
      "If it finds a targeted extension, like 1Password, the malicious extension reports back to an attacker-controlled server. The attacker then tells it to impersonate the real extension by disabling it if permissions allow, changing its name and icon and displaying a fake login popup that looks just like the real thing.",
      "Fake extension page (SquareX)",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Social engineering makes things worse",
      "To steal user credentials, the malicious extension triggers a fake \"Session Expired\" prompt when the victim tries to log in to a website. This tricks them into thinking they need to reenter their credentials for their password manager or banking app. When they do, the stolen data is sent straight to the attackers.",
      "After collecting the credentials, the extension switches back to its original form. It restores the legitimate extension, making everything look normal so the victim doesn\u2019t suspect anything. This shows just how dangerous malicious Chrome extensions can be and why stronger security measures are needed to protect users.",
      "We reached out to Google, and a spokesperson told CyberGuy,\u00a0\"We appreciate the work of the research community and we've received the report. We are constantly investing in ways to improve the security of the Chrome Web Store, and we take appropriate action when we learn of emerging threats.\"",

      "5 ways you can protect your personal data",
      "Here are five ways to safeguard your sensitive information and maintain your online privacy.",
      "1.\u00a0Keep your browser and extensions up to date: Outdated software is a goldmine for cybercriminals. Bugs or security gaps in old versions of your browser or extensions can be exploited to inject malicious code, steal data or take control of your system. Updates patch these vulnerabilities, making them a critical line of defense. Turn on automatic updates for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) so you\u2019re always running the latest version without thinking about it. See my guide on\u00a0keeping your devices and apps updated for more information.",
      "2. Install extensions only from trusted sources:\u00a0Official browser stores like the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons have rules and scans to catch bad actors, but they\u2019re not perfect. Extensions from random websites or third-party downloads are far more likely to hide malware or spyware. Stick to the official store for your browser; don\u2019t download extensions from sketchy links.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Update your passwords: Change passwords for any accounts that may have been affected by the extension and use unique, strong passwords for each account. Consider using a password manager. This can help you generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5.\u00a0Invest in personal data removal services: If your personal data gets stolen by the extension, it\u2019s crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

Security researchers pointed out that the Chrome Web Store lacks protections against these types of attacks, such as blocking sudden changes to an extension\u2019s icon or HTML, or at least alerting users when such changes occur. The problem isn\u2019t limited to the Chrome Web Store. The Play Store also hosts malicious apps from time to time, affecting millions of users.

      "1. Have strong antivirus software: Install and regularly update strong antivirus software on all your devices. Antivirus software can help detect and prevent infostealer malware infections. Be sure to perform regular scans to identify and remove potential threats. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware potentially accessing your private information is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Use virtual cards for online payments: Instead of using your actual bank card, generate virtual cards through your bank or a service like Privacy.com. These temporary cards limit exposure in case of a data breach.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Enable transaction alerts and spending limits:\u00a0Set up real-time alerts for transactions and daily spending limits on your cards. This way, you\u2019ll be notified immediately of any unauthorized activity.",
      "4. Never store card details in browsers:\u00a0Infostealers target autofill data in Chrome, Edge and Firefox. Always deny the pop-up that asks to \"save payment info\" and use a secure password manager instead. You may also want to take advantage of additional digital security measures such as\u00a0two-factor authentication. Newer types of authentication, such as Face ID and Touch ID, are slowly replacing passwords as a legitimate means to grant a person access to sensitive financial information.",
      "5. Be smart about passwords: Simply employing all the password rules won\u2019t prevent a breach, but since you don\u2019t know exactly what information thieves are looking for, it can\u2019t hurt. You should use strong passwords and change them frequently. I recommend using a password manager to generate and store strong passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal services: While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Infostealers are a major threat to everyone online, and they are also quite common. However, since this malware often disguises itself as legitimate apps or uses social engineering tricks, it\u2019s easy to get fooled. Even the most cautious individuals can fall victim to a well-executed campaign. The best way to stay safe is to exercise caution when browsing online, downloading apps or making online transactions. Using tools like a password manager and antivirus software can also help enhance security and make your life easier.",

They promise easy loans with flexible repayment, but what they actually do is steal your personal data, including contacts, sensitive images and files. The moment you take a loan, they start blackmailing you using your own data against you.",

      "SpyLend spread by posing as a credible financial management tool, \"Finance Simplified,\" on the Google Play Store, as reported by\u00a0BleepingComputer. It attracted financially vulnerable individuals by offering fast loans with minimal documentation.",
      "The app surged from 50,000 to 100,000 downloads in a single week despite red flags in user reviews about harassment and blackmail.",
      "Once downloaded, the app requested excessive permissions far beyond what a typical financial app would need, including access to contacts, SMS messages, call logs, photos and location data. This allowed the malware to silently collect personal information from users' devices.",
      "The stolen data fueled a vicious cycle of scams and extortion. SpyLoan apps like SpyLend lure users with attractive loan terms, only to exploit their data for predatory lending practices. If users fail to meet repayment demands, the operators weaponize their information by harassing them, blackmailing them with threats of leaking private photos or contacting their friends and family, and creating a climate of fear and coercion.",
      "In some cases, the extortion escalated to public shaming or even deepfake creation using stolen images, amplifying the psychological and financial toll on victims.",
      "We reached out about this incident, and a Google spokesperson told us, \"The app has been removed from Google Play. Android users are automatically protected against known versions of this malware by\u00a0Google Play Protect, which is on by default on Android devices with Google Play Services.

      "It also collects device details like the model and OS version, tracks location in real time every three seconds, records past locations and IP addresses, and it even saves the last 20 copied texts from the clipboard. On top of that, it gathers financial data like loan histories and banking SMS messages.",

      "3) Download apps from reliable sources: It\u2019s important to download apps only from trusted sources like the Google Play Store. You might say I am contradicting myself, but Play Store is still safer than other options out there. They have strict checks to prevent malware and other harmful software. However, even with the security measures provided by Google Play, downloading apps from the store does not guarantee 100% protection against malware or harmful software. Avoid downloading apps from unknown websites or unofficial stores, as they can pose a higher risk to your personal data and device. Never trust download links that you get through SMS.",
      "4) Review app permissions carefully: If an app asks for unnecessary permissions, like access to your contacts, call logs or storage, do not install it. A legitimate loan app should only require essential permissions related to financial transactions.",
      "5) Check reviews and red flags: Before installing any financial app, read user reviews carefully. If multiple people report harassment, blackmail or excessive permissions, avoid the app entirely.",
      "6) Report and uninstall suspicious apps: If you encounter a SpyLoan app, immediately\u00a0uninstall it and revoke its permissions. Report it to the Google Play Store, cybersecurity authorities and financial regulators to help prevent further victims.",

This eerily lifelike android represents a significant advancement in biomimetic robotics, closely replicating human anatomy and movement in ways never before seen.",
      "With its unsettlingly realistic movements, Protoclone is pushing the boundaries of what we expect from robots, raising both intrigue and questions about the future of robotics.",

      "The anatomy of this robot",
      "Protoclone stands at an impressive 6 feet tall and boasts a skeleton made of 206 polymer bones, mirroring the human skeletal structure. What truly sets this robot apart is its muscular system, featuring over 1,000 artificial muscles powered by\u00a0Clone Robotics' proprietary \"Myofiber\" technology.",

      "HUMANOID ROBOTS BUST DANCE MOVES ALONGSIDE HUMANS",
      "The muscle behind the machine",
      "The Myofiber system is a revolutionary approach to robotic movement. Each artificial muscle consists of a mesh tube containing an air-filled balloon. When hydraulic fluid is pumped into the balloon, it expands, causing the mesh to contract, much like a human muscle. This system is powered by a 500-watt electric pump, Protoclone's mechanical \"heart,\" capable of circulating fluid at a rate of 40 liters per minute.",

      "Protoclone's nervous system is equally impressive, featuring four depth cameras in the skull for vision, 70 inertial sensors for joint position awareness and 320 pressure sensors for force feedback. This advanced sensory network allows the robot to process visual input and learn by observing human activities.",

      "The recent video release of Protoclone in action has garnered millions of views and sparked intense online debate. In the footage, the faceless android is seen suspended from the ceiling, its limbs twitching and moving in an unsettlingly human-like manner.",
      "While some viewers have expressed awe at the technological achievement, others have reacted with discomfort or even hostility. Comments range from comparisons to \"sleep paralysis demons\" to references to dystopian science fiction scenarios.",

      "Protoclone (Clone Robotics) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The road ahead",
      "Despite its impressive capabilities, Protoclone is still in early development. Currently, it requires suspension for stability and lacks the ability to stand or balance independently. Clone Robotics plans to launch production with 279 units, named \"Clone Alpha,\" with pre-orders opening in late 2025.",

      "Urgency as a weapon: Scammers exploit our fear of financial loss to prompt hasty actions. They use phrases like, in this case, \"Act now\" or \"Cancel Now\" and warn of dire consequences if immediate action isn't taken. This urgency is designed to bypass rational thinking and prevent you from verifying the legitimacy of the request.",
      "Suspicious links: Legitimate banks avoid sending security-sensitive links via text. These links could download viruses to your device or lead you to a fake website designed to steal your personal information. Always verify the URL before entering any sensitive data.",
      "Specific yet unfamiliar details: The mention of \"Bryana White\" and the precise amount of $950.44 is a clever tactic. Scammers often use specific details to create an illusion of legitimacy, even when these details are unfamiliar to the recipient. This approach aims to instill doubt and urgency, increasing the chances that the victim will act hastily.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Brand impersonation: Scammers often employ brand impersonation tactics, using similar logos, fonts and color schemes to create a facade of legitimacy. This deceptive strategy is designed to manipulate you into believing you are interacting with a trusted institution, thereby increasing the likelihood of falling for their scam.",
      "Unsolicited contact: Be wary of unexpected texts claiming to be from your bank, especially if you haven't signed up for text alerts.",
      "Spelling and grammatical errors: Look for mistakes in spelling, grammar or punctuation. Legitimate messages from banks are usually written by professionals and are free of errors.",
      "Requests for personal information: Scammers often ask you to \"confirm\" details like your account number or password. Legitimate banks never request sensitive information via text.",

      "2. Have strong antivirus software: This can help detect and block malicious software that might be downloaded if Jane had clicked on the scammer's link. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Contact your bank directly using official channels: Jane should call Kinecta's official number to verify if there's any real issue with her account, rather than responding to the text.",
      "4. Report the text to your bank and forward it to 7726 (SPAM): By reporting this text, Jane can help Kinecta and her mobile carrier protect other customers from similar scams.",
      "5. Enable two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) on your accounts: This extra layer of security could prevent scammers from accessing Jane's account even if they obtained her password.",
      "6. Use SMS filtering tools provided by your mobile carrier: These tools might have caught and flagged the suspicious \"Kinect\" text before it reached Jane's inbox.",
      "7. Invest in personal data removal services: This can help reduce the amount of personal information available online, making it harder for scammers to target Jane and you with personalized attacks in the future. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Remember, legitimate financial institutions will never pressure you to act immediately or click on links in text messages. When in doubt, always reach out to your bank directly using official channels. Thank you, Jane, for bringing this to our attention.

The attack stemmed from a supply chain breach, where threat actors infiltrated legitimate extensions and pushed malicious updates. These updates embedded hidden scripts that allowed unauthorized data collection, altered HTTP requests and injected ads into web pages, all without users noticing.",

They also communicated with command-and-control servers to receive further instructions, showing a high level of coordination. The attackers exploited the trust users place in the Chrome Web Store and its automatic update system. Investigations suggest this activity has been ongoing since at least July 2024.",

Updates patch these vulnerabilities, making them a critical line of defense.

Install extensions only from trusted sources:\u00a0Official browser stores like the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons have rules and scans to catch bad actors, but they\u2019re not perfect. Extensions from random websites or third-party downloads are far more likely to hide malware or spyware. Stick to the official store for your browser. Don\u2019t download extensions from sketchy links.",

Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.

Independence from Denmark became a focal point of the election amid President Donald Trump\u2019s repeated talk of the U.S. taking control.",

      "Aiding the work on the front lines, especially for those countries with fewer resources, are a handful of small nonprofit groups with very limited funds.",
      "In a nondescript Mae Sot home, Miller\u2019s organization receives escapees and a trickle of survivors who have made it across the river with comfortable couches, clean water, food and working phones to reach their families. She said today\u2019s unprecedented numbers are overwhelming the aid available across the river.",
      "\"When we\u2019re looking at numbers in the thousands, the ability to get them over to Thailand and process them and house them and feed them would be impossible for most governments,\" said Miller. \"It really does require a kind of a global response.\"",
      "The recent abrupt halt to U.S. foreign aid funding has made it even harder to get help to released scam center workers.",
      "The United Nations\u2019 International Organization for Migration, for example, previously funded care for victims of trafficking in scam compounds in one shelter in Cambodia, but was forced to halt that work by the Trump Administration\u2019s funding freeze announced in January, according to a source with direct knowledge of the situation. The halt to funding has also impacted a network of civil society groups that worked to stop human trafficking and rescue survivors in Thailand.",
      "\"It\u2019s really heartbreaking to see that there\u2019s such an immense amount of people that are in need of assistance,\" said Saskia Kok, Head of Protection Unit in Thailand for the IOM.",
      "In a statement, U.S. officials acknowledged the high pressure impasse.",
      "\"The United States remains deeply concerned about online scam operations throughout Southeast Asia, which affect thousands of Americans and individuals from many other countries,\" said a State Department spokesperson in a statement sent to the AP.",
      "A bigger problem",
      "While advocates estimate some 50 million people are living in modern slavery, mass rescues of enslaved workers are rare. In 2015, more than 2,000 fishermen were rescued from brutal conditions at sea, liberated after an Associated Press investigation exposed their plight. That same year hundreds of Indians were rescued from brick factories in India. And last year Brazilian prosecutors rescued 163 Chinese nationals working in \"slavery-like\" conditions at an electric vehicle factory construction site in northeastern Brazil.",
      "\"What we are seeing at the Thai-Myanmar border now is the result of years of inaction on a trafficking crisis that has had a devastating impact on thousands of people, many of whom were simply seeking better economic prospect, but were lured to these compounds on false pretenses,\" said Amnesty International Myanmar researcher Joe Freeman.",
      "Being forced to commit a crime under threat of violence should not be criminalized, said Freeman. \"However, in general we are aware of countries in the region repatriating their nationals from scam compounds only to then charge them with crimes.\"",
      "Business as usual",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much of an effect these releases will have on the criminal groups that run the scam centers.",
      "February marked the third time the Thais have cut internet or electricity to towns across the river. Each time, the compounds have managed to work around the cuts. Large compounds have access to diesel-powered generators, as well as access to internet provider Starlink, experts working with law enforcement say.",
      "\"The resources is the one thing that they are not lacking and they\u2019ve been able to bring them to bear in the past,\" said Benedikt Hoffman, acting representative for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in the region.",
      "The armed groups that staged the crackdown have also been accused of helping to run scam compounds in Myawaddy. The head of the Kayin Border Guard Force, General Saw Chit Thu, has been sanctioned by the European Union and the United Kingdom for profiting from scam compounds and human trafficking, respectively. Compounds in the DKBA\u2019s control are less well-documented in the public record, but activists say they also control a fair number.",
      "\"There is clearly a lot of pressure on the Border Guard Force to take action and helping people to leave is one of the most visible ways to do so,\" Hoffman said. \"That said, it likely also reflects an adjustment to the business model, reducing the number of people involved \u2014 and with less attention, continuing lower key operations.\"",
      "It will take simultaneous pressure exerted in multiple areas to truly shut down the compounds, said Hoffman.",
      "In this crackdown, there have been no major prosecutions or compounds shut down.",

      "The departments must \u201coffer reinstatement to any and all probationary employees terminated on or about February 13,\u201d U.S. District Judge William Alsup wrote, referring to the date when the Office of Personnel Management held a call with department and agency heads and directed them to fire probationary employees.",
      "Alsup said the office's directive to fire all probationary employees, in a\u00a0written memo and the February phone call, was not legal.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "The office had provided departments and agencies with a template to use for firing the employees that said, \"The Agency finds, based on your performance, that you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the Agency would be in the public interest.\"",
      "\u201cIt is sad, a sad day when our government would fire some good employee, and say it was based on performance, when they know good and well, that\u2019s a lie,\u201d Alsup said.",
      "The judge added that there is nothing wrong with reductions in force \u201cif it\u2019s done correctly under the law.\"",
      "The Justice Department, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment, filed a notice of appeal later in the day.",
      "In a statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told NBC News: \"A single judge is attempting to unconstitutionally seize the power of hiring and firing from the Executive Branch. The President has the authority to exercise the power of the entire executive branch \u2014 singular district court judges cannot abuse the power of the entire judiciary to thwart the President\u2019s agenda.\"",
      "\"If a federal district court judge would like executive powers, they can try and run for President themselves. The Trump Administration will immediately fight back against this absurd and unconstitutional order,\" she added.",
      "Plaintiffs' attorney Danielle Leonard argued the government knew what it was doing in going after probationary employees for removal, saying: \u201cThis has been the plan since the very beginning. Fire them all because they can\u2019t appeal.\u201d",
      "Alsup expressed outrage at the beginning of the hearing, which had been scheduled to go over evidence, when the administration said the Office of Personnel Management's acting director, Charles Ezell, would not testify as the judge had ordered.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not helping me get at the truth,\u201d Alsup said, calling the information that the government did provide \u201cpress releases\u201d and a \u201csham.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt upsets me, I want you to know that,\u201d he said.",
      "The judge also ordered that any further terminations of probationary employees must be made by the departments or agencies themselves, within the regulations outlined in the Civil Service Reform Act and the Reduction in Force Act.",
      "Alsup further asked for a list of all fired probationary employees and an explanation of what the departments and agencies were doing to comply with the order.",
      "Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, one of the plaintiffs in the case, praised the ruling, saying it will \"immediately reinstate tens of thousands of probationary federal employees who were illegally fired from their jobs by an administration hellbent on crippling federal agencies and their work on behalf of the American public.\u201d",
      "Alsup had previously found that he OPM directive was \"illegal\" and should be rescinded \u2014 which it later was \u2014 but had not previously directed the agencies to reinstate the workers.",
      "\u201cThe Office of Personnel Management does not have any authority whatsoever under any statute in the history of the universe, to hire and fire employees within another agency,\u201d he said last month.",
      "An attorney for the Justice Department suggested then that fired employees should have their cases heard by the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board instead of a federal judge.",
      "Last week, that federal civil service board found that the firing of over 5,000 probationary employees from the Department of Agriculture\u00a0may have been unlawful\u00a0and directed that the employees be restored to their jobs for at least 45 days.",
      "In court Thursday, a lawyer for the plaintiffs told the judge that while those employees had been restored to the agency's payroll, they had not actually been put back to work.",
      "At a hearing in a separate case involving probationary workers in Maryland, a federal judge indicated he might sign an order that would put all of the fired probationary workers back to work.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Bredar made the comments after a hearing at which a coalition of states argued that the mass firings, allegedly for cause, were actually a \"reduction in force\" \u2014 a mass firing that requires the government to follow certain procedures.",
      "The judge seemed sympathetic to that argument, saying: \u201cThis case isn\u2019t about whether or not the government can terminate people. It\u2019s about if they decide to terminate people, how they must do it.\u201d",
      "He said he would issue a written ruling on the case \"promptly.\""

    "story": [
      "Four days after President Donald Trump returned to office, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt made an announcement: \u201cDeportation flights have begun. President Trump is sending a strong and clear message to the entire world: If you illegally enter the United States of America, you will face severe consequences.\"",
      "Trump began using U.S. military planes to reinforce his deportation operation, although Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been deporting immigrants on private airlines since 2010.",
      "But a month and a half after the White House announcement, the pace of deportation flights is a bit slower than those of his predecessor, former President Joe Biden. Also, the number of immigrants expelled through flights has decreased and the government has stopped using military aircraft, which according to immigration experts was more expensive and inefficient.",
      "The findings are based on a Noticias Telemundo analysis of data on deportation flights and interviews with Central American government officials and experts who have analyzed these immigration operations in recent years.",
      "Para leer en espa\u00f1ol haga click aqu\u00ed",
      "In Latin American countries such as Guatemala, Honduras and Ecuador \u2014\u00a0which receive the most deportation flights \u2014\u00a0authorities say they have not seen major changes in operations compared to previous U.S. administrations. They even predict that, if the current trend of the Trump administration continues, 2025 would end with fewer flights and fewer deportees.",
      "The decline in flights and deportees is partly due to a drop in border crossings since Trump took office, which has left immigration authorities with fewer people eligible for \u201cexpedited removal,\u201d which is used to expel those caught at the border or in an area within 100 miles of the border, and within 14 days of arrival to the country.",
      "For the analysis, Noticias Telemundo developed a database of Trump administration deportation flights based on news reports, official government information, websites that record aeronautical information and data collected by Thomas Cartwright of the group Witness at the Border, which has tracked U.S. deportation flights since 2020.",
      "Data shows that in February, 128 flights with deportees took off, including 19 military flights. That figure is lower than Immigration and Customs Enforcement's 137 deportation flights in February 2024.",
      "The main destinations of February's deportation flights were Honduras and Guatemala, countries that for years have received weekly flights with deportees.",
      "Consulted by Noticias Telemundo, the directors of both nations' migration institutes said that so far the only difference in the operation compared to previous administrations was the use of military aircraft. Otherwise, the pace of deportation flights remains about the same, they said.",
      "\u201cThere is no radical change other than the issue of deportations made by military flights,\u201d said Wilson Paz, director of Honduras\u2019 National Institute of Migration. He agreed with Honduran Foreign Minister Enrique Reyna, who in mid-February told local media they weren't seeing mass deportations from the U.S.",
      "Guatemala had a similar assessment. \u201cCompared to the previous year, it's a lower number of returnees ... on the issue of deportation we cannot talk about radical changes,\u201d Danilo Rivera, director general of the Guatemalan Institute of Migration, said.",
      "On average, Guatemala received 5,140 monthly deportees by air during 2024. In February of last year, the United States expelled 6,972 Guatemalans on 58 flights. This year, during the same month, the Trump administration deported a little over 2,000 Guatemalans on 24 flights, according to Guatemalan government data.",
      "Ecuador received 13 deportation flights from Jan. 20 to Feb. 28. Government officials estimate that, at that rate, they could end the year with fewer than 100 flights, a notable difference compared to the 150 flights the South American country received last year, Ecuadorian Deputy Foreign Minister Alejandro Davalos said in a public discussion on social network X on Feb. 25.",
      "Davalos said about 30,000 undocumented Ecuadorians in the U.S. have deportation orders, but he was skeptical that the Trump administration could expel them soon. \u201cThose deportation orders have not been executed and will not be executed in the immediate future, they were not in the past and they will certainly not be in the coming months. We are not going to have a massive flow of deported Ecuadorians,\u201d the deputy foreign minister said.",
      "On March 9, Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa said that the country won't receive immigrants deported from the U.S. who are not Ecuadorian, as Panama and Costa Rica have done in recent weeks.",
      "Authorities in Honduras and Guatemala say that the vast majority of the people they're receiving don't have serious criminal records in the U.S. beyond having entered the country without permission or committing traffic violations.",
      "NBC News reported this week that of the people deported by the Trump administration in February, about half had no criminal convictions or pending criminal charges.",
      "\u201cWe cannot continue to criminalize or treat them as criminals when we are observing that almost all of them are working people, they are people who have dignity,\u201d Rivera said.",
      "\u201cMaybe less than 1% have any criminal history,\u201d Wilson Paz said. Despite that, all deported Honduran adults fly handcuffed on planes hired by ICE, the official explained.",
      "The Honduran government has asked the U.S. to release the restrained deportees once the planes enter Honduran airspace, Paz said. \u201c(We request) in a non-negotiable way, respect for human rights, the dignity of Honduran migrants to return to their territory without handcuffs, without shackles, because here they are free,\u201d he said.",
      "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not respond to questions about the decrease in deportation flights from February 2024 to February 2025 and whether it plans to increase the number of flights.",
      "The decrease in deportation flights took place as Trump pressured countries such as Panama, Honduras and Costa Rica to accept planes with deportees of other nationalities and the administration used military aircraft to carry out the deportations.",
      "In early March, the Defense Department suspended the use of C-17 jets to transport undocumented people to the U.S. base at Guantanamo Bay and other countries.",
      "In total, the Trump administration conducted 29 military flights to seven countries, mostly Guatemala. But those flights ended up being more expensive and less efficient than the commercial flights usually contracted by ICE to expel migrants.",
      "An hourlong flight of a Boeing C-17 jet, designed to carry cargo and soldiers, costs about $28,500, according to the military's Air Mobility Command. By contrast, the average one-hour flight cost of a regular charter plane hired by ICE is $8,577 and the cost of \u201cspecial high-risk\u201d charter flights is $6,929 to $26,795 per hour, according to ICE.",
      "Military flights to Latin America have also been more expensive because aircraft have taken longer routes, avoiding Mexico\u2019s airspace, which has not allowed military planes carrying deportees to land. Mexico continues to receive ICE charter flights; between January and Feb. 11, they transported almost 2,000 Mexicans from Texas and Arizona, according to data provided by the Mexican government.",
      "The military flights carried out by the Trump administration since Jan. 24 carried an average of 68 passengers per trip, while regular ICE flights on private airline planes carried an average of 105 passengers, according to data analyzed by Noticias Telemundo.",
      "On Jan. 31, the military flight that transported 17 migrants to Honduras and 34 to Peru lasted about 19 hours round trip, according to FlightRadar data. Deporting those 51 people likely cost U.S. taxpayers more than half a million dollars, about $10,000 for each deportee.",
      "The decrease in deportation flights took place despite the fact that Colombia has been sending planes from its Air Force to pick up deported Colombians following a diplomatic crisis between Trump and Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who refused to allow military flights to land in the country. Petro decided to use the Colombian planes after Trump threatened to impose tariffs on all Colombian products imported into the U.S. as well as implement a travel ban and immediately revoke the visas of Colombian government officials.",
      "In total, the Colombian Air Force conducted 10 repatriation flights from late January to February. In addition, Venezuela sent two flights to Texas to repatriate nearly 200 Venezuelans on Feb. 10. despite the fact that President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro had refused to receive flights with deportees from the U.S. the year before.",
      "Venezuela also sent another Conviasa Airline plane to Honduras to pick up 177 Venezuelans expelled from the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on Feb. 20.",
      "The Trump administration has released images of immigrants boarding military planes in chains and the administration's border czar, Tom Homan, said in January that Army aircraft with deportees would take off every day.",
      "Experts said they thought the use of military aircraft was publicity strategy to increase the visibility of Trump\u2019s crackdown on illegal immigration and persuade immigrants to desist from crossing into the U.S. illegally.",
      "\u201cIt is neither efficient nor productive (...) but I\u2019m not surprised by the use of military aircraft,\u201d Ariel Ruiz Soto, a senior analyst at the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute, told Noticias Telemundo.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a tactic by President Trump to reduce the incentives to arrive at the border irregularly and also increase a certain sense of fear in the undocumented immigrant community that they could be subject to deportation, even though most of them would not,\u201d Ruiz explained.",
      "Fewer deportations \u2014\u00a0and fewer crossings",
      "The data seems to indicate that the focus on the military flights, along with the deployment of troops to the southern border and the increase in arrests of undocumented immigrants and images of immigrants in chains are working in stopping the flow of people trying to cross into the U.S. without permission. According to the Department of Homeland Security, the government recorded 8,347 arrests of immigrants crossing illegally from Mexico in February, the lowest number in 15 years.",
      "That abrupt drop is reflected in the decrease in deportation flights. Now, with fewer crossings, there are also fewer people to deport immediately, Ruiz said.",
      "\u201cDuring the Biden administration, especially in early 2024, most of the people they deported were those who had just crossed the border with Mexico and the United States,\u201d he explained.",
      "\u201cTo maintain those kinds of high deportations, President Trump has to rely on arrests in the interior of the country,\u201d Ruiz said. But detaining and expelling undocumented immigrants who have been living in the U.S. for years and who are entitled to a process in overcrowded immigration courts, can take years.",
      "In Central America, the kinds of deportees returning via flights points to a decrease in migration to the U.S. Last year, 8 out of 10 deportees Guatemala received were detained at the U.S. border. Currently, a third of Guatemalans coming back had been living in the U.S. for years, Danilo Rivera said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re starting to get a little bit more people who had the experience of living, working and going on with their lives in the United States,\u201d he said.",
      "In 2023, an average of 1,500 migrants a day moved through Honduras on their way to the U.S. \u201cToday, we are not even reaching 100 or 150 people who transit through our country,\u201d said Wilson Paz, the country\u2019s director of migration.",
      "\u201cRather, the migratory dynamic has taken a turn, no longer from south to north, but from north to south, because many of these people are returning to their countries and transiting through Honduras, but in reverse,\u201d the official explained."

He was chair of the Natural Resources Committee and most recently was the top Democrat on the committee. He also was one of the leading progressive voices on Capitol Hill, and he was the longest-serving co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, from 2009 to 2019.",
      "He was a senior member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "\"He was steadfast in his commitment to produce lasting change through environmental policies \u2014 as he would say, 'It\u2019s for the babies.'\u00a0He led the Natural Resources Committee without fear of repercussion, but with an urgency of the consequences of inaction,\" his staff said in a statement.",
      "\"His strong belief was that no matter where you\u2019re from, one truth unites us all: everyone deserves the freedom to live a healthy life, and every child deserves a safe and fair chance at their future,\" the statement said.",
      "Grijalva is the second House Democrat to die in office this month. First-term Rep. Sylvester Turner, D-Texas, suddenly died March 5 after he attended President Donald Trump\u2019s joint address to Congress the night before.",
      "The Republican majority in the House has been extremely tight this Congress. Grijalva's death means the Republicans control 218 seats and the Democrats control 213.",
      "Grijalva represented Arizona's 7th Congressional District, a sprawling border region that stretched from Tucson to Yuma and also included suburbs outside Phoenix.",
      "He was born in Tucson. His father, a migrant worker from Mexico, had immigrated to the United States through the Bracero labor program. He and his wife, Ramona, have three daughters.",

      "After the November election, six-term Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., launched a surprise bid against Grijalva for the top Democratic spot on the Natural Resources Committee. Rather than fight for the post, Grijalva dropped out and threw his support behind a fellow Southwesterner, Rep. Melanie Stansbury, D-N.M. Huffman easily defeated her.",
      "Grijalva was last in the Capitol on Jan. 3, the first day of the new Congress, to be sworn in for the new term. He had lost a significant amount of weight and was in a wheelchair. Since then, he missed every House vote.",
      "Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, is expected to call a special election to fill the vacancy in the coming days. Grijalva's seat is deep blue, and Democrats are expected to easily hold it.",
      "Grijalva's death was announced as House Democrats were gathering at their annual policy retreat in Virginia.",
      "At a Progressive Caucus news conference Thursday, Chairman Greg Casar, D-Texas, called Grijalva \"a champion of the environment and environmental justice\" and \"a real mentor and friend to me.\"",
      "\"I know the people of Arizona are in mourning, and our thoughts are really with his family, but it\u2019s just some very, very difficult news for us today,\" Casar said just moments after the announcement.",

      "\"As the Chairman and top Democrat on the Natural Resources Committee, Rep.

      "The eclipse will be visible across most of North and South America, as well as the western halves of Africa and Europe, the eastern parts of Australia and Russia and northern Japan.",
      "A total lunar eclipse occurs when the sun, Earth and moon align in space with Earth in the middle, leading it to cast a shadow on the moon.",
      "During that time, the moon appears to turn a reddish hue, which is why the event is sometimes referred to as a \u201cblood moon.\u201d",
      "The reason has to do with the way sunlight travels through Earth's atmosphere. Blue light, which has shorter wavelengths, scatters more easily, whereas the longer wavelengths of red light make it more likely to pass through. (The same process also explains why sunsets appear orange and the sky blue.)",
      "Unlike solar eclipses, all stages of a lunar eclipse are safe to view with the naked eye. Although binoculars and telescopes enhance the view, it\u2019ll be easily visible without them.",
      "Unfortunately for skywatchers, forecasts suggest cloudy conditions for much of U.S. tonight. So for those who miss the celestial event, the next total lunar eclipse will occur on Sept. 7, followed by another one on March 3, 2026.",

    "summary": "Megachurch founder Robert Morris was indicted by Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond after Cindy Clemishire publicly accused Morris of molesting her in the 1980s",
    "story": [
      "The indictment of former megachurch pastor Robert Morris on child sex abuse charges this week was made possible by an accuser who refused to quit, a novel legal theory and an archaic section of state criminal code that dates to Oklahoma\u2019s origins on the wild frontier.",
      "Morris, a leading national figure in the American evangelical movement and the founder of Gateway Church in Southlake, Texas, was charged Wednesday with five counts of lewd or indecent acts with a child. The indictment by a multicounty Oklahoma grand jury came nine months after Cindy Clemishire publicly accused Morris of repeatedly molesting her over a four-year span when she was a child in the 1980s.",
      "Clemishire was 12 and dressed in flowery pink pajamas the first time she says Morris touched her. It was Christmas night in her childhood bedroom in Oklahoma. It would be their secret, she recalled him saying afterward.",
      "After Clemishire went public with her account in June, Morris released a statement confessing to what he described as \u201cinappropriate sexual behavior with a young lady.\u201d Days later, he resigned as senior pastor at Gateway. Following news of his indictment this week, a Gateway spokesperson said church leaders were \u201cgrateful for the work of the justice system in holding abusers accountable for their actions.\u201d",
      "Morris didn\u2019t respond to messages requesting comment.",
      "When she spoke out last year, Clemishire had little hope that Morris would face legal consequences. The statute of limitations for bringing a civil lawsuit or criminal charges had long since expired.",
      "Or so she believed.",
      "Enter Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond. Twenty years ago, when the Republican lawyer was still in private practice, he represented Clemishire \u2014 an old family friend \u2014 as she attempted to negotiate a settlement with Morris over her allegations, which she first brought to church leaders in the 1980s. The 2005 deal fell apart when Clemishire refused Morris\u2019 demand that she sign a nondisclosure agreement, Drummond said. That was the end of his involvement in the matter, he said, but the case stuck with him.",
      "After Clemishire\u2019s accusations made national headlines last year \u2014 helping spark a reckoning over the handing of sex abuse allegations at Gateway and several other North Texas churches \u2014 Drummond said his prosecutors asked for permission to pursue a criminal investigation, and he gave it.",
      "\u201cI frankly have walled myself from that investigation and prosecution and was pleased that the grand jury believed that there was enough evidence to indict Mr. Morris,\u201d Drummond told NBC News in an interview Thursday.",
      "Drummond\u2019s office expects Morris to turn himself in to authorities next week.",
      "The prosecution turns on what Drummond called an \u201cextraordinarily unusual\u201d application of \u201ca very old statute\u201d that is most often used when prosecuting cold cases. More than a century ago, when outlaw cowboys roved the Old West committing crimes as they moved between states, Drummond said Oklahoma and other frontier states implemented a provision that essentially pauses \u2014 or tolls \u2014 the statute of limitations when someone commits a crime and then flees the state.",
      "Morris was a traveling evangelist who preached to crowds at churches and revivals across the Southwest when he entered Clemishire\u2019s life in the early 1980s. Like the out-of-state marauders who terrorized Oklahoma towns in the early 1900s, Morris did not reside in Oklahoma, so Drummond said his office determined that the statute of limitations did not apply.",
      "\u201cCertainly that will be challenged in a court of law, and we are prepared to meet that challenge,\u201d Drummond said. \u201cI anticipate that there will be, ultimately, case law made on this case.\u201d",
      "Tracy Pearl, a professor at the University of Oklahoma College of Law, said the attorney general\u2019s interpretation appears to be supported by case law.",
      "\u201cAnd from a policy perspective, I think these sorts of provisions that toll the statute of limitations when somebody is located out of state makes sense,\u201d Pearl said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to disadvantage the state or prosecutors in cases in which they may have a really limited ability to find the defendant and then extradite them back to the state.\u201d",

      "Nearly 26 years after two troubled Colorado teenagers barged into Columbine High School and opened fire, killing a dozen classmates and a teacher, one of the students left wounded by their barrage of bullets has died from the injuries she sustained on that April 20, 1999, the Jefferson County Coroner's Office reported.",
      "Anne Marie Hochhalter, 43, died of sepsis on Feb. 16 and the two gunshot wounds that left her paralyzed were a \"significant contributing factor\" in her death, Dr. Dawn B. Holmes, a forensic pathologist, wrote in a 13-page report released March 1.",
      "\u201cThe manner of death is best classified as homicide,\u201d Holmes wrote.",
      "With Hochhalter's passing, the death toll now stands at 14. That total does not include the shooters, Dylan Klebold, 17, and Eric Harris, 18, who killed themselves before police could arrest them.",
      "Hochhalter, then a 17-year-old junior, was eating lunch with friends when she was shot in the chest and back, suffering wounds that left her paralyzed from the waist down and in chronic pain for the rest of her life.",
      "Six months later, Hochhalter suffered another loss from which she never completely recovered when her mother, Carla June Hochhalter, who had been struggling with depression, walked into a pawnshop and killed herself with a loaded gun that she had been inspecting.",
      "Leaning on her faith and on friendships forged in the wake of Columbine, Hochhalter devoted her life to supporting other victims of mass shootings.",
      "\u201cShe was fiercely independent,\u201d Sue Townsend, stepmother of Columbine shooting victim Lauren Townsend told The Denver Post last month. \u201cShe was a fighter. She\u2019d get knocked down \u2014 she struggled a lot with health issues that stemmed from the shooting \u2014 but I\u2019d watch her pull herself back up. She was her best advocate and an advocate for others who weren\u2019t as strong in the disability community.\u201d",
      "In 2016, Hochhalter found it in her heart to reach out with forgiveness to Klebold's mother, Sue Klebold, after she published a memoir about raising a mass killer called \"A Mother's Reckoning.\"",
      "\u201cJust as I wouldn\u2019t want to be judged by the sins of my family members, I hold you in that same regard,\u201d Hochhalter wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s been a rough road for me, with many medical issues because of my spinal cord injury and intense nerve pain, but I choose not to be bitter towards you.\"",
      "The mass killing at Columbine put a previously obscure Denver suburb called Littleton on the nation's radar, and images of heavily armed SWAT teams descending on the school and the sight of students filing out with their hands up were burned into the national consciousness.",
      "\u201cColumbine played out on TV,\u201d Bruce Beck, who was Lauren Townsend's stepfather, told NBC News in 2019 on the 20th anniversary of the massacre. \u201cNo previous school shooting had done that. There was the unknown of where the shooters were during the entire time that it was being filmed, so I think people connected with Columbine more.\u201d",
      "The others killed at Columbine that day were teacher William \"Dave\" Sanders, 47, and students Cassie Bernall, 17, Steve Curnow, 14, Corey DePooter, 17, Kelly Fleming, 16, Matt Kechter, 16, Daniel Mauser, 15, Daniel Rohrbough, 15, Rachel Scott, 17, Isaiah Shoels, 18,  John Tomlin, 16, and Kyle Velasquez, 16.",

      "After a Connecticut woman was accused of holding her stepson captive for two decades, education advocates said the state\u2019s\u00a0largely unregulated homeschooling system could allow abusive parents to keep their children from public view with no protective oversight.",
      "The stepson, now 32, told police that he was removed from public school in the fourth grade and that he was homeschooled.",
      "His stepmother, Kimberly Sullivan, was released from jail Thursday after she posted $300,000 bail on charges of imprisoning and starving her stepson.",
      "Her attorney Ioannis Kaloidis said Sullivan denies any wrongdoing.",
      "Waterbury police have not publicly identified the stepson, who they said is 5-feet-9 and weighs\u00a068 pounds. He told police he had been severely abused since age 11, enduring \u201cprolonged abuse, starvation, severe neglect, and inhumane treatment,\u201d they said.",
      "When he was removed from school as a child, a former principal, Tom Pannone, went so far as to knock on the family\u2019s door looking for him, Pannone said in an interview.",
      "Pannone, who was principal of the now-closed Barnard Elementary School in Waterbury, said he was given several explanations about why Sullivan\u2019s son was no longer attending class in the early 2000s, including that he was being homeschooled.",
      "Interim Superintendent Darren Schwartz said, \u201cBased on available information, the student was unenrolled from the Waterbury Public Schools in 2004.\u201d",
      "Waterbury Police Lt. Ryan Bessette told NBC News the stepson told authorities that his formal education ended around the fourth grade and that then he was homeschooled.",
      "Pannone told NBC Connecticut: \u201cYou could just simply withdraw your child from school, and you didn\u2019t even have to make a plan for homeschooling. It was a very lax system, and a lot of parents would just say, \u2018I\u2019m homeschooling them,\u2019 and that was it.\u201d",
      "Sarah Eagan, of the Center for Children\u2019s Advocacy, a legal rights law firm for children, said\u00a0that many states have some type of policy or regulatory framework around withdrawing children from school for the stated purpose of homeschooling but that Connecticut does not have clear guidelines.",
      "\u201cWhen a child is dis-enrolled from school, with a caregiver saying, \u2018I\u2019m withdrawing my child to home school,\u2019 that kind of ends it. That\u2019s the end. There is no \u2018We\u2019ll meet again. We\u2019ll verify,\u2019\u201d Eagan said. \u201cBecause Connecticut has no system for that and has been reluctant to create a system yet.\u201d",
      "Eagan, who previously worked at the Office of the Child Advocate, a state watchdog agency, said that while parents have a right to educate their children as they see fit, states have a clear legal interest in ensuring the safety and education of their citizens.",
      "Which is why legal challenges to states\u2019 homeschool regulations have been upheld for the most part, she said.",
      "\u201cIt is a balancing of rights and responsibilities, and it needs a thoughtful balance, because most people who are directing the education of their children are likely doing so well and appropriately,\u201d Eagan said.",
      "\u201cBut you have individuals who take advantage of the system, and it\u2019s not really about homeschooling. It\u2019s about people who pretend, people who use the pretense of homeschooling as a guise to remove their child from public view.\u201d",
      "The years of cruelty for Sullivan\u2019s stepson ended Feb. 17 when he used a lighter, hand sanitizer and paper to set the fire, he told police.",
      "When authorities found him, he was \u201cextremely emaciated, his hair was matted and unkempt, he was very dirty and his teeth all appeared to be rotten,\u201d\u00a0according to an arrest affidavit.",
      "\u201cInvestigators further discovered that he had been provided with only minimal amounts of food and water, which led to his extremely malnourished condition,\u201d police said.",
      "To remove a student from public school in Connecticut, a parent \u201cshould\u201d formally submit that intention to district offices and file papers for the \u201cchild\u2019s withdrawal from school,\u201d according to the state.",
      "While parents are told to maintain \u201ca portfolio for each child which contains samples of activities, assignments, projects and assessments, as well as a log of books and materials used,\u201d\u00a0regulations do not appear to have significant enforcement provisions.",
      "The\u00a0National Home Education Legal Defense Association\u00a0ranks Connecticut as among the least-regulated states for parents or guardians to remove their children from class.",

Copyright \u00a9 2025 by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes. Reprinted courtesy of HarperCollins Publishers. It is available for pre-order here.",
      "Donald Trump and Kamala Harris both understood the importance of being seen as the bigger change agent.",
      "For Trump, that meant continuing to promise an antidote to the Joe Biden-Harris years. For Harris, there was more flexibility to define her brand of change. She could risk looking hypocritical by making clean breaks with Biden on policies she had supported as vice president, rejecting parts of their record to forge her own agenda. She could identify new issues to run on that avoided the pitfalls of turning her back on the Biden era. Or she could rely on voters to see her gender, her genes, and her \u201clived experience\u201d \u2014 a middle-class upbringing, schools outside the Ivy League, and a career as a prosecutor \u2014 as symbols of change.",
      "Biden and his loyalists took the first option off the table. He would say publicly that Harris should do what she must to win. But privately, including in conversations with her, he repeated an admonition: let there be no daylight between us. \u201cNo daylight\u201d was the phrase he had used as a vice presidential candidate in 2008 to bind Republican nominee John McCain to an unpopular president, George W. Bush.",
      "Almost everywhere she went, Harris walked among former Biden aides who sought to defend his presidency. Her campaign was run by a former White House deputy chief of staff \u2014 whom she had just empowered to box out her own confidants \u2014 and a phalanx of department heads who had served Biden until the previous month.",
      "The day before Harris\u2019 first interview, a joint appearance with Tim Walz, she dived into the recurring question of whether and when she would let daylight shine between herself and Biden. Veteran Democratic communications strategist Stephanie Cutter launched into a proposed preamble \u2014 a list of all the items that made Harris proud of her work with Biden.",
      "\u201cWait, wait, wait!\u201d said Sean Clegg, a longtime Harris adviser who was regarded with suspicion by the Biden holdovers running the campaign. \u201cLet\u2019s not do this. Let\u2019s not go down memory lane.\u201d That was the last time he was invited to media prep. Cutter, another Harris confidant later joked, cut him out.",
      "Cutter did not have the authority to make out the lineup card for media prep sessions, two senior campaign officials told NBC News on the condition of anonymity.",
      "When Harris sat down with Walz and CNN\u2019s Dana Bash the last week of August, the segment produced a little bit of news: Harris said she would name a Republican to serve in her Cabinet. She also said that she no longer supported a ban on fracking.",
      "Her 2019 call to end the practice threatened to hurt her in Pennsylvania, even though she had adopted Biden\u2019s no-ban policy as his vice presidential candidate in 2020. But the first portion of the one-on-two interview \u2014 the part more viewers were likely to watch \u2014 featured Harris reciting a laundry list of Biden\u2019s policies.",
      "Sitting next to Walz in a chair that seemed to place her below him and heaping praise on Biden\u2019s record, Harris did not look like a candidate seeking the highest office in the land. The whole scene reinforced the criticism that the vice president was either incapable, or afraid, of answering tough questions on her own.",
      "For the rest of the campaign, her team required that she be provided a chair that met certain specifications: \u201cLeg height no less than 15 inches; floor to top of seat height no less than 18.9 inches; arms on chairs may not be very high, arms must fall at a natural height; chairs must be firm.\u201d",
      "No matter how firm her chair, the question facing Harris was whether she could build a sturdy platform.",
      "Her rallies and convention speech had not answered the question of why she was running for president \u2014 or how her vision for the country would deliver for voters \u2014 other than having been next in line. She was running out of major moments to explain a vision to a broad audience. Her Sept. 10 debate with Trump would offer another opportunity \u2014 perhaps a last chance before voters cast early ballots \u2014 to establish that key part of her narrative.",
      "But the day of the debate Biden called to give Harris an unusual kind of pep talk \u2014 and another reminder about the loyalty he demanded. No longer able to defend his own record, he expected Harris to protect his legacy. Whether she won or lost the election, he thought, she would only harm him by publicly distancing herself from him \u2014 especially during a debate that would be watched by millions of Americans. To the extent that she wanted to forge her own path, Biden had no interest in giving her room to do so. He needed just three words to convey how much all of that mattered to him.",

    "summary": "The mother of a 10-year-old girl recovering from brain cancer who was removed to Mexico when her parents, who are undocumented were deported, is pleading for her family\u2019s return to the U.S. for the girl's medical care.",
    "story": [
      "The mother of four U.S. citizen children, including a 10-year-old girl recovering from brain cancer, is pleading for her family\u2019s return to the United States.",
      "The family was removed from the country last month after immigration authorities deported the undocumented parents to Mexico.",
      "Speaking Thursday from Mexico, the mother said in a video message in Spanish provided to NBC News that \u201cwe call on the elected officials of the United States to please help us come back so that our little girl continues to receive the medical services she needs.\u201d",
      "She first told NBC News this week what took place in early February, when the family was rushing from Rio Grande City, Texas, where they lived, to Houston, where the girl has received cancer care, for an emergency medical checkup.",
      "On the way there, they stopped at an immigration checkpoint, the one they have passed through multiple times when they have driven to Houston. The parents were equipped with letters from their doctors and lawyers to show the officers at the checkpoint to get through. But the letters weren\u2019t enough this time.",
      "\u201cWe have made this trip across Texas several times to take our daughter to the hospital so that she can receive the medical attention, which is what keeps her well,\u201d her mother said in her video message. \u201cThat\u2019s what keeps her safe.\u201d",
      "\"This time, we were detained, held, and we faced the worst decision, an impossible one, to be permanently separated from our children or to be deported together,\u201d she said.",
      "When undocumented parents of U.S.-born children are picked up by immigration authorities, they face the risk of losing custody of their children. Without power-of-attorney documents or guardianships\u00a0outlining who will take care of the children left behind, the children go into the U.S. foster care system, making it harder for parents to regain custody of their children in the future.",
      "Immigration authorities arrested the woman and her husband after they were unable to show legal immigration documentation. Present with the parents were five of their children, four of whom are U.S. citizens. The parents and the children were then taken to a detention facility, where they spent 24 hours before they were placed in a van and dropped on the Mexico side of a Texas bridge on Feb. 4.",
      "On Thursday, a Customs and Border Protection spokesperson said via email that the reports of the family\u2019s situation are \u201cinaccurate\u201d because \u201cwhen someone is given expedited removal orders and chooses to disregard them, they will face the consequences\u201d of the process. They stated they couldn\u2019t speak about the specifics of the case for privacy reasons.",
      "NBC News is withholding the names of the woman and the rest of the family members, since they were deported to an area in Mexico that is known for kidnapping U.S. citizens.",
      "\u201cWe are now deported to Mexico without access to the urgent medical care our daughter needs. Our children, including American citizens, have been forced to face a crisis that no child should have to face,\u201d the woman said in the video, which was shared with NBC News by the Texas Civil Rights Project, a legal advocacy and litigation organization representing the family.",
      "The 10-year-old girl was diagnosed with brain cancer last year and underwent surgery to remove the tumor. The swelling on her brain is still not fully gone, her mother said, causing difficulties with speech and mobility of the right side of her body. Before the family was removed from the United States, the girl was routinely checking in with doctors monitoring her recovery, attending rehabilitation therapy sessions and taking medication to prevent convulsions.",
      "\u201cShe doesn\u2019t deserve that suffering,\" her mother said. \"She already has enough suffering from cancer without having the medical attention she needs.\u201d"

    "summary": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., indicated Thursday he would vote to advance Republicans\u2019 six-month funding bill that passed the House to avert a government shutdown Friday night.",
      "The move represents a major concession from Schumer, yielding to the GOP measure just one day after he vowed that Democrats wouldn\u2019t allow it to pass. It means the bill is likely to find enough votes to clear the 60-vote threshold, and eventually pass with a simple majority, even as a growing number of Senate Democrats came out in opposition to it Thursday.",
      "\u201cThere are no winners in a government shutdown,\u201d Schumer said in a floor speech. \u201cIt\u2019s not really a decision, it\u2019s a Hobson\u2019s choice: Either proceed with the bill before us or risk Donald Trump throwing America into the chaos of a shutdown.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor sure, the Republican bill is a terrible option. It is not a clean CR. It is deeply partisan. It doesn\u2019t address far too many of this country\u2019s needs. But I believe allowing Donald Trump to take even much more power via a government shutdown is a far worse option,\u201d he added. \u201cI will vote to keep the government open and not shut it down.\u201d",
      "The remarks came after Schumer informed his colleagues in a closed-door meeting that he would vote for the procedural motion to advance the funding bill when it comes to the Senate floor Friday, according to a source familiar with his remarks. Schumer\u2019s private comments were first reported by The New York Times.",
      "If the Senate passes passes the bill, it would then go to President Donald Trump\u2019s desk for a signature. A shutdown occurs after 11:59 p.m. ET on Friday if no law is enacted by then.",
      "\u201cWe have a choice between terrible and awful,\u201d said Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga.",
      "It\u2019s unclear what if anything Schumer received in return for his decision to allow the House bill to proceed. Speaking with reporters after his Senate speech, Schumer said Democrats would \"try to get some amendments on the bill.\u201d",
      "Before his comments, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., hinted that Democrats could try to secure a vote on an amendment to the House bill to turn it into a 30-day, rather than a six-month, stopgap measure. But he didn't commit to dropping opposition to the bill if the amendment was voted down.",
      "Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., is the only Senate Democrat who has said he'd vote to advance the House bill, although several others have stayed quiet about how they would handle a procedural vote. Schumer told reporters that \u201cmembers are making their own decisions right now.\u201d",
      "Earlier in the day, a growing number Democrats vowed to oppose the legislation. That included Sen. John Hickenlooper, D-Colo., who called the bill \u201cdangerous\u201d; Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., who said it\u2019d \u201cgive unchecked power to Donald Trump and Elon Musk\u201d; Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., who blasted it as \u201ca grab bag of extreme policies\u201d; Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., who called it \u201ca terrible deal\u201d that\u2019d hurt Virginia.",
      "\u201cOne thing is certain: If we pass this continuing resolution for the next half year, we will own what the president does,\u201d said Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. \u201cI am not willing to take ownership of that.\u201d",
      "From outside the Democratic lunch meeting, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., could be heard yelling about about devastating impacts of a government shutdown, particularly at this juncture.",
      "Senators have faced heavy pressure from House Democratic colleagues and liberal advocates outside of the Capitol to hold the line against the funding bill, which was crafted by Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and the White House.",
      "Earlier this week, just one House Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, voted for the bill, which party leaders in the chamber railed against.",
      "Yet even as some Democrats were rallying against the House GOP bill, they struggled to offer a plausible endgame to avert a shutdown \u2014 or reopen the government if funding lapses after Friday night. They demanded a 30-day stopgap measure to continue funding at status quo levels in order to reach a full funding deal for fiscal year 2025.",
      "That discombobulated approach clashes with the fact that Trump and Johnson have said they don\u2019t want an appropriations deal for a fiscal year that is already half over, as they want to move on to their party-line budget bill to address taxes, immigration and other priorities.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to convince them. Now, they can be convinced or unconvinced,\u201d Sen. John Hickenlooper, D-Colo., said about the GOP\u2019s rejection of a new appropriations deal.",
      "Democratic senators have cited numerous objections to the House bill.",
      "First, they had no input in developing it \u2014 some in the party fear that voting for this would empower Johnson and Trump to dictate outcomes without negotiating with Democrats to earn their votes.",
      "Second, they object to provisions that would cut non-defense domestic spending by billions of dollars, including a hit to the District of Columbia\u2019s budget, while boosting military spending \u2014 a move they see as sacrificing Democratic priorities for GOP priorities.",
      "Third, they worry that voting for this measure without guardrails on executive power would green-light Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk\u2019s moves to dismantle parts of the federal government or refuse to spend money directed by Congress.",
      "A new memo Thursday from the Center For American Progress Action Fund, led by longtime Democratic adviser Neera Tanden, called on the party to hold the line against the House Republican bill, making the policy and messaging case for it.",
      "\u201cWhile the consequences of a shutdown are real, Democrats bear no responsibility in fact or in public perception if they continue to support a clean CR or clean 30-day CR. However, supporting the MAGA plan will sap momentum that is building against Republicans,\u201d said the memo, which was obtained by NBC News from a congressional Democratic source who received it. \u201cLawmakers must focus on connecting the so-called CR to how the Administration and DOGE are actively causing radical harm.\u201d",
      "Some Democrats believe that voters will blame Republicans in the event of a government shutdown. In a new Quinnipiac national poll, 53% of registered voters said they would blame Trump or Republicans in Congress if the government shuts down; 32% said they\u2019d blame Democrats. Another 15% didn\u2019t know or wouldn\u2019t say.",
      "\u201cJiminy Christmas! Republicans control the House, Senate and White House,\u201d Sen. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n, D-N.M. said.",
      "But Senate Republican leaders say it\u2019s time to dispense with the debate over fiscal 2025 funding, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Thursday on the floor that the House bill was the only path to preventing a shutdown.",
      "\u201cDemocrats need to decide if they\u2019re going to support funding legislation that came over from the House, or if they\u2019re going to shut down the government,\u201d he said."

      "Service members who received a less than honorable discharge from the military are disqualified from accessing certain benefits, such as medical care through the Veterans Health Administration and a pension. Those who were honorably discharged but whose discharge form says they separated from the military due to homosexuality could be outed when they are required to present the form to receive benefits or during background checks.",
      "The agreement, which was reached in January, will allow veterans who received a less than honorable discharge because of their sexual orientation to be eligible for an immediate review and an upgrade to an honorable discharge. Veterans who received an honorable discharge, but whose discharge form states that they separated from the armed services because of their sexual orientation, will be able to have that characterization removed from the form within months.",
      "As part of the settlement, the Defense Department has to create a streamlined process for veterans to request a review of their discharge paperwork. The department now has until mid-August to post information on its website and mail letters to class members telling them how to apply for a new military discharge form. Once the new process is in place, class members will have three years to submit requests for new discharge forms.",
      "In response to a request for comment on the settlement, a Pentagon press officer referred NBC News to the Department of Justice. The DOJ and the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers did not immediately return a request for comment.",
      "This week\u2019s class-action settlement comes as another federal judge weighs whether to block President Donald Trump\u2019s administration from banning transgender people from military service. The ban stems from an executive order signed by the president on Jan. 27 that reinstates a policy from his first term and rescinds an order from former President Joe Biden that allowed trans people to enlist and serve openly."

    "summary": "Megachurch founder Robert Morris was indicted by Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond after Cindy Clemishire publicly accused Morris of molesting her in the 1980s",
    "story": [
      "The indictment of former megachurch pastor Robert Morris on child sex abuse charges this week was made possible by an accuser who refused to quit, a novel legal theory and an archaic section of state criminal code that dates to Oklahoma\u2019s origins on the wild frontier.",
      "Morris, a leading national figure in the American evangelical movement and the founder of Gateway Church in Southlake, Texas, was charged Wednesday with five counts of lewd or indecent acts with a child. The indictment by a multicounty Oklahoma grand jury came nine months after Cindy Clemishire publicly accused Morris of repeatedly molesting her over a four-year span when she was a child in the 1980s.",
      "Clemishire was 12 and dressed in flowery pink pajamas the first time she says Morris touched her. It was Christmas night in her childhood bedroom in Oklahoma. It would be their secret, she recalled him saying afterward.",
      "After Clemishire went public with her account in June, Morris released a statement confessing to what he described as \u201cinappropriate sexual behavior with a young lady.\u201d Days later, he resigned as senior pastor at Gateway. Following news of his indictment this week, a Gateway spokesperson said church leaders were \u201cgrateful for the work of the justice system in holding abusers accountable for their actions.\u201d",
      "Morris didn\u2019t respond to messages requesting comment.",
      "When she spoke out last year, Clemishire had little hope that Morris would face legal consequences. The statute of limitations for bringing a civil lawsuit or criminal charges had long since expired.",
      "Or so she believed.",
      "Enter Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond. Twenty years ago, when the Republican lawyer was still in private practice, he represented Clemishire \u2014 an old family friend \u2014 as she attempted to negotiate a settlement with Morris over her allegations, which she first brought to church leaders in the 1980s. The 2005 deal fell apart when Clemishire refused Morris\u2019 demand that she sign a nondisclosure agreement, Drummond said. That was the end of his involvement in the matter, he said, but the case stuck with him.",
      "After Clemishire\u2019s accusations made national headlines last year \u2014 helping spark a reckoning over the handing of sex abuse allegations at Gateway and several other North Texas churches \u2014 Drummond said his prosecutors asked for permission to pursue a criminal investigation, and he gave it.",
      "\u201cI frankly have walled myself from that investigation and prosecution and was pleased that the grand jury believed that there was enough evidence to indict Mr. Morris,\u201d Drummond told NBC News in an interview Thursday.",
      "Drummond\u2019s office expects Morris to turn himself in to authorities next week.",
      "The prosecution turns on what Drummond called an \u201cextraordinarily unusual\u201d application of \u201ca very old statute\u201d that is most often used when prosecuting cold cases. More than a century ago, when outlaw cowboys roved the Old West committing crimes as they moved between states, Drummond said Oklahoma and other frontier states implemented a provision that essentially pauses \u2014 or tolls \u2014 the statute of limitations when someone commits a crime and then flees the state.",
      "Morris was a traveling evangelist who preached to crowds at churches and revivals across the Southwest when he entered Clemishire\u2019s life in the early 1980s. Like the out-of-state marauders who terrorized Oklahoma towns in the early 1900s, Morris did not reside in Oklahoma, so Drummond said his office determined that the statute of limitations did not apply.",

    "story": [
      "A Navy veteran and his wife said they were blindsided when Tricare, the military\u2019s health care program, rescinded over $100,000 in medical claims it had approved and paid several years ago.",
      "Harve Smith, 71, received a $470 bill in January for dermatologist visits in 2020. He thought it was a one-off error until he discovered that Tricare had retroactively denied 26 more claims for a total of about $3,000 worth of services it had already reimbursed providers for since 2019, when he first enrolled in Tricare For Life, a plan for Tricare-eligible people who have Medicare.",
      "Tricare also reversed approvals for at least 10 claims, totaling about $100,400, for his wife, Janice, in the same time frame, while nine other claims that had once been marked as completed are being re-processed, according to records from her Tricare portal, which NBC News reviewed.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know where this ends,\u201d said Janice Smith, 67, who has multiple sclerosis and worries the stress will aggravate the autoimmune disorder.",
      "The couple, who live in Fallon, Nevada, said they would have to use their retirement funds or remortgage their home, which they fully own, to clear the debt. Anxiety has kept Harve Smith, who served in the Navy for 15 years until 1994, from sleeping through the night.",
      "\u201cIt just kept waking me up,\u201d said Harve Smith, a former lieutenant commander. \u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d",
      "It is unclear what prompted the reversals, which appear to be legal under federal law, according to two health care attorneys.",
      "In Nevada, recoupment time frames are usually set by contracts between private health insurers and providers, Las Vegas-based attorney Ayesha Mehdi said. The contracts often allow insurers to recoup payments within a year or two and sometimes four years, she said.",
      "But because federal law is stronger than state law, Mehdi said, Tricare, a federal program, is allowed to rescind payments under its regulations, which permit recovery for up to 10 years in cases of overpayment or mistakes.",
      "The Defense Health Agency, which oversees Tricare, did not say whether it had overpaid or made an error or whether the couple\u2019s case was unique. Spokesperson Brenda Campbell said that it cannot comment publicly on individual health cases but that it would work with the Smiths to investigate further.",
      "Health Net Federal Services, the former contractor for the Tricare west region, also said it could not comment on specific cases, citing health privacy laws, but it said it is \u201cactively looking into the matter.\u201d",
      "TriWest Healthcare Alliance, which took over the contract this year, deferred comment to Health Net, which it said is responsible for processing and paying claims before Jan. 1. TriWest said it has not recouped or tried to recoup any payments from the Smiths and is not allowed to take such actions under its contract with the Defense Health Agency.",
      "After having spent weeks calling the agencies and being bounced around between departments, the Smiths said, they have not gotten clarity.",
      "Meanwhile, the $470 bill from the dermatologist has already gone to collections. The Feb. 7 collections notification, which was reviewed by NBC News, instructs Harve Smith to pay the balance within the next 30 days or face adverse credit reporting.",
      "We have this looming over us.",
      "Janice smith, veteran's wife",
      "The Smiths said they do not plan to pay the bills out of pocket until they have confirmation that it is their responsibility to do so.",
      "Documents in Harve Smith\u2019s Tricare portal, which NBC News also reviewed, show that Tricare did issue payments to the dermatologist in 2020.",
      "Janice Smith said: \u201cIt has been so stressful, and it is so scary. We can\u2019t be the only ones in this position.\u201d",
      "Millions of service members, retirees, their families and network providers nationwide have felt cascading disruptions following Tricare\u2019s contract changes this year.",
      "About 16,000 health care providers on the East Coast alone have not been paid this year, officials said, forcing many to drop Tricare patients, reduce their hours or consider closing their clinics. On the West Coast, federal officials said, beneficiaries are struggling with a host of issues, including long wait times at call centers and stalled referrals and authorizations.",
      "On Jan. 1, TriWest began managing Tricare benefits on the West Coast and in six Eastern states that were reallocated to the west region. The Defense Health Agency said the new contract would \u201cimprove health care delivery, quality, and access\u201d for U.S. beneficiaries. But it has acknowledged that several challenges have cropped up nationwide since then.",
      "The Smiths said it took weeks of calling Tricare before anyone picked up the phone. During one attempt, they said, they waited on hold for over two hours.",
      "\u201cI was so exhausted. I just started crying,\u201d Janice Smith said.",
      "She said they called Tricare For Life, which is Tricare\u2019s Medicare program, but were redirected to at least three other numbers. When they finally reached a representative for the military\u2019s Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System database, which holds information for every service member, Janice Smith said, they were told the officials had to manually fix her husband\u2019s records.",
      "The Smiths said database system did not elaborate on what was wrong with his records or what caused the apparent error. They were told to complete a Tricare form asking to reinstate their enrollment, even though they did not know whether they had been removed.",
      "In the meantime, they do not know whether they currently have health care coverage and whether they are on the hook to repay all of the claims out of pocket.",
      "Janice Smith said Tricare had initially approved her and her husband\u2019s services, which included brain scans to monitor her condition, hip replacement surgery, physical therapy and annual checkups.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to pay. We are not in the wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were covered. We had insurance.\u201d",
      "The Smiths, who have been married for 42 years, had been enjoying their retirement and spending their time visiting their daughters in Hawaii and Virginia.",
      "They said the claims reversals, which have triggered at least two medical bills so far, have caused them to live more frugally, limiting their travel and even lunch dates.",
      "\u201cWe were the epitome of footloose and fancy-free,\u201d Janice Smith said. \u201cNow we have this looming over us.\u201d"

      "\u201cIt\u2019s back to basics in many ways,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re all sci-fi stories, but there\u2019s definitely some horrifying things that occur, but maybe not in an overt horror-movie way. There\u2019s definitely some disturbing content in it.\u201d",
      "The new trailer revealed little information, it appears that artificial intelligence will be a heavy theme. The rest of the bone-chilling stories are yet to be revealed.",
      "When does 'Black Mirror' return for Season 7?",
      "\"Black Mirror\" premieres on Netflix on April 10.",
      "How many episodes are in Season 7?",
      "The seventh season will feature six brand-new episodes, including a sequel episode to the classic \"USS Callister\" episode from the show's fourth season.",
      "\u201cYou can expect a mix of genres and styles,\u201d series creator Charlie Brooker said previously when speaking during Netflix\u2019s Geeked Week. \u201cWe\u2019ve got six episodes this time, and two of them are basically feature-length. Some of them are deeply unpleasant, some are quite funny, and some are emotional.\u201d",
      "The callback episode stems from \u201cUSS Callister,\u201d which follows a programmer named Robert Daly (played by Jesse Plemons) who creates a simulated reality within a \u201cStar Trek\u201d like video game, putting himself in the captain seat with his crew stemming from his actual co-workers (including actress Cristin Milioti).",
      "This will be the first time the show does a sequel episode.",
      "\u201cNormally, I kill off all the characters at the end of an episode, and I kept some of \u2019em alive. I\u2019m growing as a human,\u201d Brooker said during Geeked Week.",
      "Who is in the cast of 'Black Mirror' Season 7?",
      "While many cast members have already been announced, such as Paul Giamatti, Awkafina, Rashida Jones, and Cristin Milioti, new cast members have additionally been added to the star-studded list, including Will Poulter.",
      "Poulter starred in the interactive \"Black Mirror\" movie \"Bandersnatch,\" playing a famous game creator named Colin Ritman. Based on the trailer, it appears he may be reprising the role."

      "Over the course of her career, Yarros has published more than 10 books, including \"Fourth Wing,\" \"Iron Flame\" and \"Onyx Storm\" \u2014 the first three books in the \"Empyrean\" series. During an episode of the \"Open Book with Jenna\" podcast, Yarros reflected on her publishing pace with Jenna Bush Hager.",
      "Yarros said she had already written most of \u201cIron Flame\u201d by the time \u201cFourth Wing\u201d came out, so the sequel came out just six months after the first. Then in 2024, Yarros published a romance book, \u201cVariation.\u201d The\u00a0third book in the \u201cEmpyrean\u201d series, \u201cOnyx Storm,\u201c came out in January 2025.",

      "Yarros shared that before the release of \"Fourth Wing,\" she sat down with her husband to have a conversation about the demands of publishing the series. Yarros, like the main character of \"Fourth Wing,\" has Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, which affects her body's connective tissue.",
      "\"I said, 'It's going to require me working hours that my body won't sustain, and I won't get to see the kids, and I won't get to do this,'\" Yarros recalled.",
      "She said her husband, a military veteran, told her, \"This is your turn.\"",

      "But starting with the third book, which was published 14 months after the second, Yarros said they decided together to \"draw it back.\"",
      "\u201cI miss my kids, and I miss my family, and I feel like I wasn\u2019t able to be present because I was just driven by these deadlines,\u201d Yarros said. \u201cAnd so now being able to take a step back and say, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m still going to work and do this, but I need healthy hours. I need to work eight hours a day and not 12 to 15.\u2019\"",
      "In addition to wanting to slow her pace down for her family, she added that she wants to prioritize her own mental and physical health.",
      "\"I think you have to have a sustainable pace,\" Yarros said. \"So, in order to keep putting these books out, I had to slow it down so it's sustainable. Otherwise, it's burnout, and then no one gets books.\"",
      "But Yarros said she will \"always write.\"",
      "\"There will always be a time I'm in a real life situation and I look at two people and I think, 'How can I make you miserable and then make you fall in love?'\" she said. \"You know, it's just the way my brain's gonna work. I will probably write until I die.\"",
      "In fact, she's already dreaming up her next book. Yarros told Jenna the next book she writes will be a contemporary romance, instead of a new fantasy installment.",
      "\u201cI swing back and forth between the two,\u201d she said about rotating genres she writes.",
      "But \"Empyrean\" fans, never fear. Plans for the fourth book are underway.",

      "O\u2019Gorman entered the villa as a Bombshell in Episode 2, coupling up with OG islander Allen in Episode 4. The couple stayed together until the end, visiting the hideaway together and deciding they were both closed off \u2014 meaning neither would pursue other islanders while in the villa.",
      "Outside the villa, they haven\u2019t officially put the boyfriend and girlfriend label on their relationship yet, they tell TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cI think the difference between like boyfriend and girlfriend (and) where we are now is absolutely nothing,\u201d O\u2019Gorman tells TODAY.com.",
      "O\u2019Gorman says being continuously asked about labels adds unnecessary pressure.",
      "\u201cLike, I will ask Gabby to be my girlfriend at some point,\u201d he says. \u201cBut do you know what it is? It\u2019s all this like noise of, \u2018When are you going to ask? When are you going to ask?\u2019 I feel like I don\u2019t want to now just ask it because people are saying it. I want to just do it.\u201d",
      "Allen clarifies that they are not dating other people. \u201cWe don\u2019t feel pressure from boyfriend and girlfriend to where we are now,\u201d Allen says. \u201cI think it will happen just naturally.\u201d",
      "So, what does that entail now? Well, they\u2019ve already met each other\u2019s friends and family.",
      "\u201cLove Island: All Stars\u201d Season 1 winners Molly Smith and Tom Clare, who are good friends of O\u2019Gorman\u2019s, invited O\u2019Gorman and Allen on a double date as soon as they returned from South Africa. When the couple arrived, they realized it wasn\u2019t a double date \u2014 it was a surprise party with all their loved ones.",
      "The two couples have planned an official double date for the future. Allen says that she gets along with Smith well \u2014 in fact, the two have a girls\u2019 night planned for this week.",
      "Allen says that O\u2019Gorman met her dog, Oscar, too, although O\u2019Gorman isn\u2019t sure if he\u2019s passed Oscar\u2019s test yet.",
      "\u201cI think he\u2019s jealous. Whenever I\u2019m kissing Gabby, like hugging her, he\u2019s always there, like barking at me, \u2018Oh, God, this person,\u2019\u201d he jokes.",
      "They're also planning their next international adventure. When the couple first exited the villa, winning a combined $50,000, they had ideas to spend the money on a trip to the Maldives and a treat for Allen's mom.",
      "The couple still wants to go away, but decided it's not the best time of year for the Maldives.",
      "\u201cWe want to be able to go away just the two of us with no cameras in our faces,\u201d O\u2019Gorman says. \u201cWe are just doing some research on the best place to go and when we\u2019re going to go because we\u2019re both just so busy at the moment work wise.\u201d",
      "Allen also plans to take her mom and brother to Dubai at the beginning of April.",
      "In the mean time, O\u2019Gorman and Allen \u2014 who only live 10 minutes apart from each other \u2014 have been getting to know each other even better, enjoying the small things like nights in together.",
      "One of O\u2019Gorman\u2019s favorite moments was their first official date, which included a dinner out. He said this was \u201cthe first time we genuinely could just chat openly, not with people from the island, and just have a nice meal.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Allen prizes the memory of O\u2019Gorman showing up on her doorstep with flowers on one of their first nights back in the U.K. She also loves how O\u2019Gorman and her brother get along so well as family is super important to her.",
      "O\u2019Gorman says the most important part about the transition from villa life to the real world has been maintaining communication.",
      "\u201cChatting to each other (and) still being able to make time with each other, I think, is huge,\u201d he says.",
      "He also feels that their connection is more \u201cgenuine and real\u201d now that they are outside of the villa.",
      "\u201cYou never know on camera if those genuine feelings are genuine. You just never know if people in there are going to be playing a game or not,\u201d he says.",
      "The show may be over, but the drama has continued. While appearing on GK Barry\u2019s \u201cSaving Grace\u201d podcast, O\u2019Gorman and Allen were asked if they thought there were any couples who wouldn\u2019t last. O\u2019Gorman said only, \u201cYeah, I think there are couples that probably won\u2019t last.\u201d",
      "Fans then speculated the pair meant Ekin-Su C\u00fclc\u00fclo\u011flu and Curtis Pritchard. O\u2019Gorman clears it up.",
      "\u201cHonestly, that wasn\u2019t directed towards anyone,\u201d O\u2019Gorman tells TODAY.com. \u201cI just feel like every single year on \u2018Love Island\u2019 there\u2019s normally only about one or two couples that make it past six months. So, it was directed just towards that, more than anything, and just the",
      "Allen added that people have just assumed that what they said was about C\u00fclc\u00fclo\u011flu and Pritchard, but that wasn\u2019t the case.",
      "\u201cEveryone seems to be going quite strong,\u201d she says. \u201cWe saw everybody yesterday and it was really nice to see because everyone seems to be going from strength to strength. So right now, I wouldn\u2019t be able to put my finger on who would be the first to break up because everyone looked very solid.\u201d"

      "In the show, Amanda Seyfried plays Mickey, a Philly cop and a single mom struggling to make ends meet on one income. When multiple women die of overdoses in close succession, Mickey realizes that it might not be a coincidence. She's further motivated to find an answer because her sister, Kacey (Ashleigh Cummings), struggles with addiction and has been missing.",

      "There's an element of bringing awareness to what it is to be somebody in active addiction, to be somebody in recovery or to be the family member of somebody who struggles with substance use disorder. What this does is bring a light specifically \u2014 it's a love story between sisters.",
      "I'm very happy it's set in Philadelphia, where I've lived for 16 years, and we were able to do local casting to bring actors from Philly, and non-actors from Philly, on set to play large and small roles.",
      "I think they're fundamentally different shows. I think we offer a look at actual Philadelphia. It's a very urban show. It also examines a pretty marginalized and underserved community. I hope it offers a pretty nuanced vision of the city of Philadelphia and runs counter to the negative media that the city and neighborhood have received in the past.",
      "I've corresponded with a lot of readers since the book was published in 2020, and they\u2019ve shared really, really moving things with me. I\u2019ve heard from people in recovery from addiction. I\u2019ve heard from family members who have lost loved ones to addiction. I\u2019ve heard from family members who have are happily sharing a story of a loved one who who\u2019s in recovery as well. And I think that was really important to us in \"Long Bright River,\" to portray \"Long Bright River\" as something from which it is possible to recover \u2014 and telling a good, propulsive mystery at the same time.",
      "I think it was important to all of us who wrote on the series to tell a really good story and to prioritize good storytelling, rather than writing like to a particular set of themes. Because I think when you're writing to a theme or two themes, sometimes your characters can end up feeling kind of like weighed down by that.",
      "Character first, place first, story first \u2014 everything else is a byproduct of that.",
      "For viewers who have read the book, I think the heart of the book is very much still in the series \u2014 but I think they may possibly also be surprised by certain departures, hopefully in a good way.",
      "We changed one major character (Ed. note: G, Mickey's grandfather in the show) from a woman in the book to a man in the show, partly because we thought it would be fun to incorporate Mummer culture. It\u2019s a very big part of Philly culture. The mummers are groups of musicians and performers and who dress up and form parade units on New Year\u2019s Day.",
      "As far as I know this, it hasn\u2019t really been portrayed much in pop culture.",
      "No, I never do. I never outline. I know a very limited amount of information when I begin a novel, and it's where the novel is set, who the main character characters are and what the initial problem is that they have to solve \u2014 but I don't know the answer to the problem.",
      "So in the case of \"Long Bright River,\" I did not know who was responsible for the deaths of the the victims, I did not know where Mickey's sister had gone and I did not know whether there would be a connection between those two things."

      "A new TikTok trend is bringing pangs of nostalgia to the internet as people bring back an iconic '90s dance.",
      "Set to rapper Doechii\u2019s song \u201cAnxiety,\u201d people have been re-creating a moment from \u201cThe Fresh Prince of Bel Air\u201d between Will Smith and Ashley Banks, played by Tatyana Ali.",
      "In recent weeks, even celebrities \u2014 including Smith and Doechii \u2014 have hopped on the trend and drawn millions of eyes.",
      "Psychotherapist and TODAY columnist Niro Feliciano says the trend helps to normalize anxiety, and that by making light of it, people can feel like they have more control over their symptoms.",
      "\"People\u00a0often feel paralyzed by anxiety and its effects, and the dance shows that we are not,\" Feliciano tells TODAY.com. \"It gives us something to do \u2014 and even dance in and of itself can help to overcome some of the symptoms.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the dance trend taking over TikTok.",
      "What is the \u2018Anxiety\u2019 dance trend on TikTok?",
      "In the popular videos, two people re-create the scene from \"The Fresh Prince of Bel Air,\" when Will walks in on Ashley jamming to music on her Walkman. At first, Ashley doesn't notice Will, who then begins to copy all her dance moves. When Ashley turns around, she's met with Will hitting some fierce moves of his own.",
      "The videos have garnered so much attention that Will Smith shared the original clip from the show on TikTok, but set Doechii\u2019s much newer \u201cAnxiety.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been watching y\u2019all and every video has been better than the last!! Love that track\u00a0@Doechii.\u00a0@Tatyana Ali,\u201d Smith wrote, tagging both the rapper and his former co-star.",
      "Reacting to her song and the dance going viral, Doechii also hopped on TikTok to clear up how the song came to be.",
      "Doechii explained that \u201cyears ago,\u201d she recorded a remix of \u201cSomebody That I Used to Know\u201d and titled the track \u201cAnxiety.\u201d Then, in 2023, rapper Sleepy Hallow sampled her song on his track also called \u201cAnxiety.\u201d",
      "Now that the sound has surged in popularity, Doechii said she went back into the studio so she could release her own version. The track dropped on March 5 and has more than 22 million streams on Spotify.",
      "On TikTok, more than 725,000 videos have been posted using the song, with many incorporating the dance from \"The Fresh Prince of Bel Air.\"",
      "Doechii herself has taken part in the trend, as well as celebrities like Demi Lovato.",
      "\"Felt anxious, might delete later\u2026\" Lovato captioned her TikTok as she danced with a pal.",
      "Influencer Bretman Rock also did a take on the trend involving a slew of chickens instead of a singular dance partner.",
      "\"Me and the girlies,\" Rock wrote in the caption of the post, which garnered more than 4 million likes.",
      "The benefits of 'Anxiety' dance trend",
      "Certain anxiety disorders can cause intense, excessive and persistent worry and fear about everyday situations, and they can also involve panic attacks or repeated, sudden episodes of fear or terror that peak within minutes, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "Feliciano explains research shows that creative expression can help overcome anxious thoughts and feelings, so she loves that the dance was paired with \"Anxiety.\"",
      "\"Dancing gives our brain another focus and requires multiple regions of the brain to perform,\" she says. \"It is nearly impossible feel anxiety when we do things like dance, sing or anything creative, which requires many physiological processes.\"",
      "A 2021 study from UCLA Health that found conscious dance produced mental health benefits among the vast majority of participants with depression, anxiety or history of trauma.",
      "\"We also know dancing, like other physical exercise, releases mood elevating hormones, such as serotonin\u00a0and endorphins,\" Feliciano says.",
      "So if you've been wanting to give the \"Anxiety\" TikTok dance a try, it's not just only fun \u2014 you may feel better afterward, too."

      "A group of more than 80 Afghan women who fled the Taliban regime to study in Oman say they are at risk of imminent deportation to Afghanistan after their U.S.-funded scholarship was canceled as part of the Trump administration\u2019s cuts to foreign aid.",
      "The female students received an email on Feb. 28 informing them that the scholarship program administered by the U.S. Agency for International Development at the Middle East College of Oman had been terminated along with thousands of other foreign aid initiatives, according to the email obtained by NBC News.",
      "The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The plight of the Afghan students was first reported by the BBC.",
      "In a letter to aid groups, the Afghan women are appealing for urgent help to allow them to continue their studies abroad and avoid returning to a country where, they say, they will face certain persecution and life-threatening risks.",
      "\u201cThe situation is catastrophic,\u201d the letter says. \u201cBeing sent back to Afghanistan would mean the permanent loss of our education and exposure to severe risks, including oppression, insecurity, and a future without opportunities. This is a life-or-death situation for many of us.\u201d",

      "The program for female scholars was launched in 2019 with a $50 million endowment from USAID, according to Brian Le, deputy legislative director of With Honor, a nonprofit group that works with veterans in Congress from both parties on bipartisan initiatives. Interest from the endowment has covered the cost of the program, which was administered by USAID, without requiring additional annual funding from the U.S. government, Le said.",
      "Nonprofit groups are in discussions with the government of Oman to try to resolve the situation, he said.",

      "While the letter from the Afghan students said 83 women were affected, Le said it now appears more than 120 Afghans had their scholarship funding cut off.",
      "Since the Taliban returned to power in 2021 following the withdrawal of U.S.-led forces from Afghanistan, they have reimposed draconian restrictions on women, including banning them from secondary school and higher education,\u00a0prohibiting them from most employment and limiting their freedom of speech and movement, according to human rights groups.",

      "\u201cThe Trump administration thinks it\u2019s politically advantageous to villainize USAID, but Americans need to realize that behind the cancelled contracts and mass layoffs are innocent lives now put at risk,\u201d he said in an email.",
      "\u201cIn this case, these bright young women with the world ahead of them could receive what could amount to a death sentence in a matter of days \u2014 simply because they were relying on a US-funded scholarship to get their education abroad.\u201d"

Informed by the attorney that Khalil was in the United States as a permanent resident with a green card, the agent said they were revoking that too, according to the lawyer.",
      "The arrest appears to be among the first known actions under President Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to deport international students who joined the protests against the war in Gaza that swept college campuses last spring. His administration has claimed participants forfeited their rights to remain in the country by supporting Hamas, a terror organization.",

      "\u201cThis has the appearance of a retaliatory action against someone who expressed an opinion the Trump administration didn\u2019t like,\u201d Mackler said.",

      "The university\u2019s allegations against Khalil focused on his involvement in the Columbia University Apartheid Divest group.

      "But as the nation grapples with this surge in violence, here\u2019s what we know about what\u2019s happening on the ground and what it could mean for Syria\u2019s future.",
      "What we know",
      "Syria\u2019s rugged Mediterranean shore was a stronghold of the Assad family\u2019s brutal regime, which lasted 53 years before a rebel alliance led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) ousted Assad three months ago in a lightning-fast offensive that swept across the nation and led HTS leader Sharaa to become the new government\u2019s interim president.",
      "However, Syria\u2019s northwest coast remains a fractured battleground, with armed Assad loyalists holding on to villages and remote pockets of territory.",
      "Sharaa\u2019s government has deployed armed forces to the region in a bid to assert control, but fierce clashes erupted last week that have left hundreds dead.",
      "Video posted on social media and verified by NBC News showed dozens of bodies piled on a blood-soaked street in Latakia. Women gathered around the bloodied corpses. One can be heard sobbing, \u201cMy dad, my brother, oh, God.\u201d",
      "Other verified videos showed military vehicles moving through the countryside amid explosions and gunfire, while another showed soldiers indiscriminately dropping bombs from a helicopter over Latakia\u2019s rural areas.",
      "The SOHR\u00a0is a prominent information office dedicated to documenting human rights abuses in Syria.",
      "The group said that the vast majority of people killed in the current clashes were from the Alawite sect and that women and children were executed by firing squad in the countryside near Tartus.",
      "NBC News has not independently verified the death toll or methods of execution.",
      "The Associated Press reported that Sunni gunmen, perhaps loyal to the government, initiated revenge killings Friday, with residents saying that Alawites were being killed in the streets or at the gates of their homes and that their houses were looted and set on fire.",
      "SOHR also reported that 125 government security forces and 148 militants from Assad-affiliated armed groups were among the dead.",
      "Federico Jachetti,\u00a0Syria country office director for the Norwegian Refugee Council, said in a statement Sunday that\u00a0the escalation is \u201ca grim reminder that the situation in the country remains fragile\u201d and cited reports of \u201csummary killings, widespread displacement and thousands more left trapped in their homes.\u201d",
      "\u201cSyrian families across the country are yearning for a respite after long years of uncertainty and fear,\u201d he said, calling on all parties to protect civilians.",
      "Who are the Alawites?",
      "The once-ruling minority is a tight-knit Islamic sect to which the Assad family belongs. Under Assad, Alawites were appointed to key positions in the military and security forces, positioning them as the elite within Syria\u2019s state bureaucracy and security apparatus.",
      "The rise of HTS, a former Al Qaeda affiliate with an extremist past, raised deep concerns among the Alawite community as it took power.",
      "Sunni dominance has inflicted deep scars on the region, and minorities like the Alawites, as well as Christians, Druze and Yazidis, all have reasons to fear the rise of extremist governance.",
      "Sharaa had tried to quell such fears, telling CNN in December, \u201cNo one has the right to erase another group.\u201d",
      "But the recent surge in violence suggests a different story, challenging Sharaa\u2019s claim that his interim government would protect all groups and foster stability.",
      "The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker T\u00fcrk, urged\u00a0Syria's leadership to take \u201cswift actions to protect\u00a0Syrians, including by taking all necessary measures to prevent\u00a0any violations and abuses.\u201d",
      "What does this mean for Syria?",
      "Unifying Syria\u2019s diverse ethnic and religious groups has been one of the major challenges of a post-Assad Syria. A significant escalation of violence could threaten the country\u2019s fragile stability and at worst threaten to tip the country back into civil war should the interim government lose control of some areas.",
      "Sharaa has actively sought to rebrand himself as a unifier willing to put down his previous extremist affiliations. For a time, this strategy appeared successful, generating a surge of goodwill and optimism.",
      "In February, a video surfaced showing Sharaa waving from the sunroof of a black vehicle, surrounded by a jubilant crowd during his first visit to Latakia, where he appeared receive a hero\u2019s welcome.",
      "Internationally, the explosion of violence may derail the progress Sharaa has made in reassuring Western leaders that he can ferry in a Syria free of threats."

      "The female students received an email on Feb. 28 informing them that the scholarship program administered by the U.S. Agency for International Development at the Middle East College of Oman had been terminated along with thousands of other foreign aid initiatives, according to the email obtained by NBC News.",

      "In a letter to aid groups, the Afghan women are appealing for urgent help to allow them to continue their studies abroad and avoid returning to a country where, they say, they will face certain persecution and life-threatening risks.",
      "\u201cThe situation is catastrophic,\u201d the letter says. \u201cBeing sent back to Afghanistan would mean the permanent loss of our education and exposure to severe risks, including oppression, insecurity, and a future without opportunities. This is a life-or-death situation for many of us.\u201d",

Interest from the endowment has covered the cost of the program, which was administered by USAID, without requiring additional annual funding from the U.S. government, Le said.",

      "While the letter from the Afghan students said 83 women were affected, Le said it now appears more than 120 Afghans had their scholarship funding cut off.",
      "Since the Taliban returned to power in 2021 following the withdrawal of U.S.-led forces from Afghanistan, they have reimposed draconian restrictions on women, including banning them from secondary school and higher education,\u00a0prohibiting them from most employment and limiting their freedom of speech and movement, according to human rights groups.",

      "Multiple international agencies have been searching for the student since her disappearance March 6 as the investigation nears its second week.",
      "Here's what we know about the case.",
      "Who is Sudiksha Konanki?",
      "Konanki is a 20-year-old biology junior at the University of Pittsburgh, according to the Loudoun County, Virginia, sheriff's office. She is an Indian citizen and permanent U.S. resident who lives with her family in Chantilly, Virginia, which is in Loudoun County.",

      "When was Konanki last seen?",
      "Konanki was last seen in the early hours of March 6 after she went to the beach with friends.",
      "She disappeared after 4:15 a.m. that day, after her friends left the beach and Konanki stayed behind with people she met while on the trip.",
      "Security video showed Konanki and her friends entering the beach area in the Riu Republica Resort where they were staying,\u00a0Dominican Republican National Police said.",
      "Loudoun County Sheriff Michael Chapman told\u00a0NBC Washington\u00a0on Monday that Konanki's friends went back to the hotel after about 40 minutes, and that Konanki stayed with the others who she met and who were not friends from college.",
      "One of the last people who had contact with the missing student said \"that a wave hit them while they were on the beach and caused some kind of situation,\" Dominican President Luis Abinader said at a\u00a0news conference Monday, citing local reports. Abinader said at the time they were still trying to piece together what happened.",
      "Konanki's friends went on an excursion Thursday, and did not realize she had disappeared until they returned, about 12 hours later, at which point they told the hotel about their missing friend,  National Police spokesperson Diego Pesqueira said.",
      "The Loudoun County Sheriff's Office was then notified of her disappearance, Chapman said.",
      "National Police launched a search effort for Konanki Friday morning after it learned she was missing, using drones, helicopters, divers, boats and canine units. The search effort was expanded on Monday.",
      "Konanki's friends were supposed to return to the U.S. on Friday but stayed back to aid in the search for her,\u00a0sheriff's office spokesperson Thomas Julia said.",
      "The hotel said beach access is always open and that security guards are stationed around the hotel and the area.",
      "What do we know about the investigation?",
      "Multiple agencies are involved in the investigation into Konanki\u2019s disappearance. It is being led by Dominican police, the Dominican attorney general's office, the FBI and a U.S. Embassy liaison.\u00a0The U.S. Coast Guard is also involved in the investigation.",
      "A person of interest has been identified and was interviewed at length, Julia, the sheriff's office spokesperson, told NBC News. The sheriff's office has no jurisdiction over the case but sent detectives to the island to assist local investigators.",
      "A person of interest is \"not the same thing as a suspect as this is not a criminal matter. It is still a missing person case,\" Julia said.",
      "National Police said Thursday morning they do not use the term \"person of interest\" in their investigations and no one is considered a suspect at this point.",
      "The University of Pittsburgh said it was in contact with Konanki's family and offering support in the investigation. The Indian Embassy in the Dominican Republic is also helping in the investigation, Chapman said.",
      "Konanki\u2019s family had traveled to Punta Cana to aid in search efforts but as of Thursday had returned to Virginia. They declined to comment on the search for her.",
      "La Altagracia Civil Defense, the local Dominican Republic emergency operations agency,\u00a0shared photos of multiple agencies searching on the beach\u00a0over the weekend. The hotel was also assisting in search efforts, it said.",
      "Authorities have said it's not clear whether her disappearance is accidental or whether foul play was involved.",
      "No signs of blood or violence were found at the beach, Pesqueira said.",
      "National Police sent teams to monitor the beach overnight at least twice to watch how the water moves to see where a body would drift if someone drowned, and to see where the waves crash.",
      "A hotel spokesperson said red flags \u2014\u00a0which indicate \"that the sea had a strong current and very high waves\" \u2014\u00a0were flying at the time of Konanki's disappearance.",
      "On Thursday morning, Dominican authorities said the search was moving from the Riu Republic Resort to Macao beach.",

      "The sheriff's office said it filed for Interpol to issue a yellow notice, a worldwide police alert for a missing person that will alert authorities if she travels to another country.",
      "\"We are going on the presumption that she\u2019s still alive,\" Chapman said Monday. \"We want to make sure that we're exhausting every possible lead that we can, and we feel we're doing that.\""

      "\"The European Union, one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the World, which was formed for the sole purpose of taking advantage of the United States, has just put a nasty 50% Tariff on Whisky,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"If this Tariff is not removed immediately, the U.S. will shortly place a 200% Tariff on all WINES, CHAMPAGNES, & ALCOHOLIC PRODUCTS COMING OUT OF FRANCE AND OTHER E.U. REPRESENTED COUNTRIES. This will be great for the Wine and Champagne businesses in the U.S.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the European Commission said that the region's trade minister has already contacted his U.S. counterparts and that \u201ccalls are being prepared.\u201d",
      "Later Thursday morning, Trump posted: \"The U.S. doesn\u2019t have Free Trade. We have 'Stupid Trade.' The Entire World is RIPPING US OFF!!!\"",
      "After some early gyrations Thursday morning, the major U.S. stock indexes settled firmly in the red, with the S&P 500 approaching correction territory, almost 10% down from its all-time high in February. The tech-focused Nasdaq index was down 1.4% and is now down more than 14% from is February high.",
      "The United States remains the world's largest importer of both wine and Champagne and sparkling wine, with the former comprising $4.9 billion in annual sales and the latter more than $1.7 billion. Meanwhile, U.S. exports of wine rank fifth among all nations at about $1 billion, while its exports of sparkling wine total just $67 million, 12th in the world.",
      "The impact of the tit-for-tat tariffs could weigh more heavily on U.S. consumers, who depend on imports of the goods, than manufacturers of them.",
      "In a statement, the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, which represents alcohol makers here, called on Trump to come to an agreement with the E.U. over the impasse, noting that neither region's liquors have been subjected to tariffs for multiple decades.",
      "\"We urge President Trump to secure a spirits agreement with the EU to get us back to zero-for-zero tariffs, which will create U.S. jobs and increase manufacturing and exports for the American hospitality sector.\u00a0We want toasts not tariffs,\u201d said Chris Swonger, the council's president and CEO.",
      "Trump has made wielding tariff threats against stalwart U.S. partners a core practice of his early second administration. The latest volley shows he has no plans to halt doing so despite protests from economists and businesses groups alike about the repercussions of such a policy. On Wednesday, Trump\u2019s largest tariffs regime \u2014 targeting all steel and aluminum imports into the United States \u2014 went into effect. In response, the E.U. and Canada announced they would impose retaliatory duties on U.S.-made products.",
      "Trump has repeatedly suggested the United States' large trade deficit with the rest of the world is a sign of weakness. He has acknowledged that his tariffs strategy may lead to a period of \"transition\" for the U.S. economy, which has shown signs of wobbling in recent weeks, but he has said it will ultimately emerge stronger.",
      "Thursday morning, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick added additional context to Trump's latest barb and the E.U.'s specifically targeting products from states that strongly support Trump.",
      "\"The president was totally annoyed that the Europeans did this, and so you\u2019re going to hear back from someone who emotionally cares about America,\" he said on Bloomberg Television.\u00a0\"He cares about America, and he wants to take care of Americans. And why are Europeans picking on Kentucky bourbon ... Harley Davidson motorcycle? It\u2019s disrespectful.\"",
      "Lutnick added Trump was looking to \"balance\" trade relations with the E.U.",
      "\"We are your largest, most important trading partner. Treat us with respect, and let\u2019s get a little balance,\" he said.",
      "Ernst B\u00fcscher, a spokesperson for the German Wine Institute, said in an interview that a 200% tariff would be a \"catastrophe,\" noting that the United States is the most important export market for German winemakers, accounting for about one-sixth of exports.",
      "He added that when a tariff of 25% was placed on German wines during the first Trump administration, importers and winemakers shared the cost to shield U.S. consumers from the price increases \u2014 but that would most likely not be possible with a 200% tariff.",
      "French Trade Minister Laurent Saint-Martin said in a statement Thursday that Trump was \"escalating the trade war he chose to launch.\"",
      "\"France remains determined to fight back with the European Commission and our partners,\" he said. \"We will not give in to threats and will always protect our industries.\u201d",
      "So far, market reaction to Trump's approach has been broadly negative. Major stock indexes have erased their post-electoral gains, as investors rebel against the prospect of higher costs. On Thursday, stock futures immediately fell in response to Trump's latest announcement, though they pared their losses somewhat after a favorable inflation report.",
      "Most academics say the ability of U.S. consumers and businesses alike to import goods cheaply mostly leads to higher living standards and more efficient output for companies."

      "The Baloch Liberation Army, an armed ethnic group that has waged a yearslong insurgency against the Pakistani government, claimed responsibility for the attack.
