      "Bob Weir, guitarist, singer and founding member of the Grateful Dead, has died at age 78",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Bob Weir, the guitarist and singer who as an essential member of the Grateful Dead helped found the sound of the San Francisco counterculture of the 1960s and kept it alive through decades of endless tours and marathon jams, has died. He was 78.",
      "Weir\u2019s death was announced Saturday in a statement on his Instagram page.",
      "\u201cIt is with profound sadness that we share the passing of Bobby Weir,\u201d a statement on his Instagram posted Saturday said. \u201cHe transitioned peacefully, surrounded by loved ones, after courageously beating cancer as only Bobby could. Unfortunately, he succumbed to underlying lung issues.\u201d",
      "Weir joined the Grateful Dead \u2014 originally the Warlocks \u2014 in 1965 in San Francisco at just 17 years old. He would spend the next 30 years playing on endless tours with the Grateful Dead alongside fellow singer and guitarist Jerry Garcia, who died in 1995.",
      "Weir wrote or co-wrote and sang lead vocals on Dead classics including \u201cSugar Magnolia,\u201d \u201cOne More Saturday Night\u201d and \u201cMexicali Blues.\u201d",
      "After Garcia\u2019s death, he would be the Dead's most recognizable face. In the decades since, he kept playing with other projects that kept alive the band's music and legendary fan base, including Dead & Company.",
      "\u201cFor over sixty years, Bobby took to the road,\u201d the Instagram statement said. \"A guitarist, vocalist, storyteller, and founding member of the Grateful Dead. Bobby will forever be a guiding force whose unique artistry reshaped American music.\u201d",
      "Weir\u2019s death leaves drummer Bill Kreutzmann as the only surviving original member. Founding bassist Phil Lesh died in 2024. The band's other drummer, Mickey Hart, practically an original member since joining in 1967, is also alive at 82. The fifth founding member, Ron \u201cPigpen\u201d McKernan, died in 1973.",
      "Dead and Company played a series of concerts for the Grateful Dead\u2019s 60th anniversary in July at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, drawing some 60,000 fans a day for three days.",
      "Born in San Francisco and raised in nearby Atherton, Weir was the Dead's youngest member and looked like a fresh-faced high-schooler in its early years. He was generally less shaggy than the rest of the band, but he had a long beard like Garcia\u2019s in later years.",
      "The band would survive long past the hippie moment of its birth, with its ultra-devoted fans known as Deadheads often following them on the road in a virtually non-stop tour that persisted despite decades of music and culture shifting around them.",

      "\u201cLongevity was never a major concern of ours,\u201d Weir said when the Dead got the Grammys\u2019 MusiCares Person of the Year honor last year. \u201cSpreading joy through the music was all we ever really had in mind, and we got plenty of that done.\u201d",
      "Ubiquitous bumper stickers and T-shirts showed the band's skull logo, the dancing, colored bears that served as their other symbol, and signature phrases like \u201cain't no time to hate\u201d and \u201cnot all who wander are lost.\u201d",
      "The Dead won few actual Grammys during their career \u2014 they were always a little too esoteric \u2014 getting only a lifetime achievement award in 2007 and the best music film award in 2018.",
      "Just as rare were hit pop singles. \u201cTouch of Grey,\u201d the 1987 song that brought a big surge in the aging band's popularity, was their only Billboard Top 10 hit.",
      "But in 2024, they set a record for all artists with their 59th album in Billboard's Top 40. Forty-one of those came since 2012, thanks to the popularity of the series of archival albums compiled by David Lemieux.",
      "Their music \u2014 called acid rock at its inception \u2014 would pull in blues, jazz, country, folk and psychedelia in long improvisational jams at their concerts.",
      "\u201cI venture to say they are the great American band,\u201d TV personality and devoted Deadhead Andy Cohen said as host of the MusiCares event. \u201cWhat a wonder they are.\u201d",

      "That spirit was on full display Friday as the AFI Awards gathered its 2026 honorees for an invitation-only luncheon in Beverly Hills, where the institute once again celebrated the collaborative nature of film and television by honoring creative teams \u2014 in front of and behind the camera.",
      "Inside the ballroom, there were no acceptance speeches in the traditional sense and no suspense over envelopes. Instead, AFI\u2019s ceremony unfolded as a series of thoughtfully written tributes: eloquent rationales for each honored film and television program, followed by brief clips designed to place the year\u2019s work within a broader cultural and artistic context.",

      "On the red carpet, with \u201cDeath by Lightning\u201d actor Nick Offerman beside him, George Clooney shared laughs with a photographer, adding to the easygoing tone that carried throughout the afternoon.

      "K-pop is an inextricable force in global pop culture",
      "NEW YORK -- Two things can be true at once. K-pop is an inextricable force in global pop culture, and it has long been undercelebrated at institutions like the Grammys \u2014 where K-pop artists have performed but have never taken home a trophy.",
      "That could change at next month's 2026 Grammy Awards ceremony. Songs released by K-pop artists \u2014 or K-pop-adjacent artists, more on that later \u2014 have received nominations in the big four categories for the first time. Ros\u00e9, perhaps best known as one-fourth of the juggernaut girl group Blackpink, is the first K-pop artist to ever receive a nomination in the record of the year field for \u201cAPT.,\u201d her megahit with Grammys' favorite Bruno Mars.",
      "The song of the year category also features K-pop nominees for the first time. \u201cAPT.\u201d will go head-to-head with the fictional girl group HUNTR/X's \u201cGolden,\u201d performed by Ejae, Audrey Nuna and Rei Ami from the \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d soundtrack.",
      "And the girl group Katseye, the brain child of HYBE \u2014 the entertainment company behind K-pop sensation BTS and countless other international acts \u2014 fashioned in the image of the K-pop idol system, has been nominated for best new artist.",
      "It depends on who you ask.",
      "Areum Jeong, assistant professor of Korean Studies at Arizona State University and author of \u201cK-pop Fandom: Performing Deokhu from the 1990s to Today\u201d says the majority of these nominations strike her more as \u201ca de-territorialized, hybrid idea of K-pop,\u201d instead of a recognition of K-pop.",
      "While Ros\u00e9 \u201cwas recruited and trained under the K-pop system, and while \u2018APT.\u2019 does contain some motifs from the Korean drinking game,\u201d Jeong says, \u201cthe song does not feel like a localized K-pop production. \u2026 Same with Katseye, who was trained and produced under HYBE but marketed more toward Western fans and listeners.\u201d",
      "Jeong says that both \u201cAPT.\u201d and Katseye's \u201cGabriela\u201d \u2014 both of which will go head-to-head with \u201cGolden\u201d in the pop duo/group performance category \u2014 \u201cseem less K-pop than other K-pop songs that could have been nominated over the years.\u201d",
      "She argues the same is true for the music of \u201cKpop Demon Hunters.\u201d \u201cIt is very similar to \u2018APT.\u2019 in that it takes inspiration and motif from Korean culture,\u201d where \u201cK-pop serves as an idea, a jumping-off point, or a motif, creating alternatives or new possibilities.\u201d",
      "Mathieu Berbiguier, a visiting assistant professor in Korean Studies at Carnegie Mellon University, points out that these nominations differ from past K-pop Grammy nominations because \u201cGolden,\u201d \u201cAPT.\u201d and Katseye all feature \u201ca mainstream popular music factor.\u201d",
      "That's the connection of a massive popular Netflix film (\u201cKpop Demon Hunters\u201d), a collaboration with Bruno Mars (\u201cAPT.\u201d), and Katseye's international membership and Netflix series (\u201cPop Star Academy: Katseye\u201d), respectively.",
      "\u201cIt tells you that K-pop is not considered as something niche anymore,\u201d he says. \u201cNow, when we think about pop music in general, we also think of K-pop as part of it.\u201d",
      "Bernie Cho, industry expert and president of the South Korean agency, the DFSB Kollective, agrees that there is an international, mainstream appeal to the nominees.",
      "\u201cAll the nominees represent a sort of post-idol K-pop, in the sense that Ros\u00e9, the three ladies of HUNTR/X and Katseye represent the globalized version of K-pop, where the \u2018K\u2019 is very much there, but some people might argue it\u2019s silent. The songs are not necessarily for Korea, by Korea, from Korea, just kind of beyond Korea,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a celebration and testament to how diverse and dynamic K-pop has become.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor years, the Recording Academy has snubbed K-pop acts that have set record-breaking standards, such as BTS,Seventeen and Stray Kids,\u201d argues Jeong. \u201cI think one of the main reasons is that the Western world is still so resistant to non-English lyrics.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt does not surprise me that \u2018APT.\u2019 and Katseye\u2019s music, which mainly contain English lyrics and seem less K-pop, were nominated,\u201d she continues.",

      "Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter Sonia De Los Santos has canceled her upcoming performances at the Kennedy Center in Washington",
      "NEW YORK -- Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter Sonia De Los Santos is the latest performer to cancel an appearance at the Kennedy Center in Washington. She had been scheduled to give two concerts for young people on Feb. 7, followed by a \u201ccreative conversation\u201d with the audience.",
      "De Los Santos, a Mexican American whose 2018 release \u201c\u00a1Alegr\u00eda!\u201d received a Latin Grammy nomination for best children's album, cited her background as a reason for calling off the shows.",
      "\"As an artist, I treasure the freedom to create and share my music, and for many years I have used this privilege to uplift the stories of immigrants in this country,\" she wrote Thursday on Instagram. \u201cUnfortunately, I do not feel that the current climate at this beloved venue represents a welcoming space for myself, my band, or our audience.\u201d",
      "In an email to The Associated Press, De Los Santos shared her Instagram statement and said she would have no additional comment. Kennedy Center spokesperson Roma Daravi challenged De Los Santos' citing of immigration policy.",
      "\u201cThis country was built on legal immigrants and as a first generation American, I find her statement highly offensive,\" Daravi wrote in an email. \"Refusing to engage with an institution open to everyone is, in fact, a step towards discrimination.\u201d",
      "Artists ranging from \u201cHamilton\u201d creator Lin-Manuel Miranda to rock star Peter Wolf have called off events at the Kennedy Center since President Donald Trump ousted the previous leadership early last year and arranged for himself to head the board of trustees. Trump has highlighted the Kennedy Center in his wide-ranging fight against what he calls \u201cwoke\u201d bias at cultural institutions.",

      "Last week, the Grammy-winning banjo player Bela Fleck announced that he had canceled three scheduled appearances next month with the National Symphony Orchestra, writing on social media that playing at the center had become \u201ccharged and political.\u201d Ric Grenell, a diplomat and Trump ally whom the president appointed to lead the center, wrote on X that Fleck had \u201cmade it political and caved to the woke mob.\u201d",
      "Other recent withdrawals include \u201cWicked\u201d composer Stephen Schwartz, who had been expected to host an opera gala in the spring, and the variety show Asian AF, whose shows in May were listed as canceled on the Kennedy Center website, then removed entirely. Daravi cited a \u201cscheduling conflict.\u201d A representative for Asian AF did not immediately responds to requests for comment.",

      "Harvey Weinstein is returning to a New York court",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Harvey Weinstein returns to court Thursday, seeking to get his latest sex crime conviction thrown out because anger and apprehensions flared among jurors during deliberations last spring.",
      "It's the latest convoluted turn in the former Hollywood honcho's path through the criminal justice system. His landmark #MeToo-era case has spanned seven years, trials in two states, a reversal in one and a retrial that came to a messy end in New York last year. Weinstein was convicted of forcing oral sex on one woman, acquitted of forcibly performing oral sex on another, and the jury didn't decide on a rape charge involving a third woman \u2014 a charge prosecutors vowed to retry yet again.",
      "Weinstein, 73, denies all the charges. They were one outgrowth of a stack of sexual harassment and sex assault allegations against him that emerged publicly in 2017 and ensuing years, fueling the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct. Early on, Weinstein apologized for \u201cthe way I've behaved with colleagues in the past,\u201d while also denying that he ever had non-consensual sex.",
      "At trial, Weinstein's lawyers argued that the women willingly accepted his advances in hopes of getting work in various capacities in show business, then falsely accused him to net settlement funds and attention.",
      "The split verdict last June came after multiple jurors took the unusual step of asking to brief the judge on behind-the-scenes tensions.",
      "In a series of exchanges partly in open court, one juror complained that others were \u201cshunning\u201d one of the panel members; the foreperson alluded to jurors \u201cpushing people\u201d verbally and talking about Weinstein's \u201cpast\u201d in a way the juror thought improper; yet a third juror opined that discussions were \u201cgoing well.\u201d The foreperson later came forward again to complain to the judge about being pressured to change his mind, then said he feared for his safety because a fellow panelist had said he would \u201csee me outside.\u201d The foreperson eventually refused to continue deliberating.",
      "In court, Judge Curtis Farber cited the secrecy of ongoing deliberations and reminded jurors not to disclose \u201cthe content or tenor\u201d of them. Since the trial, Weinstein's lawyers have talked with the first juror who openly complained and with another who didn't.",
      "In sworn statements, the two said they didn't believe Weinstein was guilty, but had given in because of other jurors' verbal aggression.",

      "Weinstein's lawyers contend the tensions amounted to threats that poisoned the process, and that the judge didn't look into them enough before denying the defense's repeated requests for a mistrial. Weinstein's attorneys are asking him to discard the conviction or, at least, conduct a hearing about the jury strains.",
      "Prosecutors maintain that the judge was presented with claims about \u201cscattered instances of contentious interactions\u201d and handled them appropriately. Jurors' later sworn statements are belied, prosecutors say, by other comments from one of the same jury members. He told the media right after the trial that there \u201cwas just high tension\u201d in the group.",
      "Prosecutors also said the foreperson\u2019s concerns about discussions of Weinstein\u2019s past were vague and the topic wasn\u2019t entirely off-limits. Testimony covered, for example, 2017 media reports about decades of sexual harassment allegations against him.",
      "The judge is expected to respond Thursday. He could set the conviction aside, order a hearing or let the verdict stand without any further action. Whatever he decides could be appealed.",
      "Meanwhile, prosecutors have said they're prepared to retry Weinstein on the rape charge the jury couldn't decide last spring. Currently being held in New York, he also is appealing a rape conviction in Los Angeles.",

      "It plays a little loose with facts but the righteous rage of \u201cDog Day Afternoon\u201d is present enough in Gus Van Sant\u2019s \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire,\u201d a based-on-a-true-tale hostage thriller that\u2019s as deeply 1970s as it is contemporary.",
      "In February 1977, Tony Kiritsis walked into the Meridian Mortgage Company in downtown Indianapolis and took one of its executives, Dick Hall, hostage. Kiritsis held a sawed-off shotgun to the back of Hall's head and draped a wire around his neck that connected to the gun. If he moved too much, he would die.",
      "The subsequent standoff moved to Kiritsis\u2019 apartment and eventually concluded in a live televised news conference. The whole ordeal received some renewed attention in a 2022 podcast dramatization starring Jon Hamm.",
      "But in \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire,\u201d starring Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd as Kiritsis, these events are vividly brought to life by Van Sant. It\u2019s been seven years since Van Sant directed, following 2018\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Worry, He Won\u2019t Get Far on Foot,\u201d and one of the prevailing takeaways of his new film is that that\u2019s too long of a break for a filmmaker of Van Sant's caliber.",
      "Working from a script by Austin Kolodney, the filmmaker of \u201cMy Own Private Idaho\u201d and \u201cGood Will Hunting\u201d turns \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire\u201d into not a period-piece time capsule but a bracingly relevant drama of outrage and inequality. Tony feels aggrieved by his mortgage company over a land deal the bank, he claims, blocked. We\u2019re never given many specifics, but at the same time, there\u2019s little doubt in \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire\u201d that Tony\u2019s cause is just. His means might be desperate and abhorrent, but the movie is very definitely on his side.",
      "That\u2019s owed significantly to Skarsg\u00e5rd, who gives one of his finest and least adorned performances. While best known for films like \u201cIt,\u201d \u201cThe Crow\u201d and \u201cNosferatu,\u201d here Skarsg\u00e5rd has little more than some green polyester and a very \u201970s mustache to alter his looks. The straightforward, jittery intensity of his performance propels \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire.\u201d",
      "Yet Van Sant\u2019s film aspires to be a larger ensemble drama, which it only partially succeeds at. Tony\u2019s plight is far from a solitary one, as numerous threads suggest in Kolodney\u2019s fast-paced script. First and foremost is Colman Domingo as a local DJ named Fred Temple. (If ever there were an actor suited, with a smooth baritone, to play a \u201970s radio DJ, it\u2019s Domingo.) Tony, a fan, calls Fred to air his demands. But it\u2019s not just a media outlet for him. Fred touts himself as \u201cthe voice of the people.\u201d",

As much as he tortures his hostage (a very good Dacre Montgomery), he\u2019s kind to the police officers surrounding him. And as he and Dick spend more time together, Dick emerges as a kind of victim, himself. It\u2019s his father\u2019s bank, and when Tony gets M.L. Hall (Al Pacino) on the phone, he sounds painfully insensitive, sooner ready to sacrifice his son than acknowledge any wrongdoing.",
      "Pacino\u2019s presence in \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire\u201d is a nod to \u201cDog Day Afternoon,\u201d a movie that may be far better \u2014 but, then again, that\u2019s true of most films in comparison to Sidney Lumet\u2019s unsurpassed 1975 classic. Still, Van Sant\u2019s film bears some of the same rage and disillusionment with the meatgrinder of capitalism as \u201cDog Day.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s also a telling, if not entirely successful subplot of a local TV news reporter (Myha\u2019la) struggling against stereotypes. Even when she gets the goods on the unspooling news story, the way her producer says to \u201cchop it up\u201d and put it on air makes it clear: Whatever Tony is rebelling against, it\u2019s him, not his plight, that will be served up on a prime-time plate.",
      "It doesn\u2019t take recent similar cases of national fascination, such as Luigi Mangione, charged with killing a healthcare executive, to see contemporary echoes of Kiritsis' tale. The real story is more complicated and less metaphor-ready, of course, than the movie, which detracts some from the film's gritty sense of verisimilitude. Staying closer to the truth might have produced a more dynamic movie.",
      "But \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire\u201d still works. In the film, Tony\u2019s demands are $5 million and an apology. It's clear the latter means more to him than the money. The tragedy in \u201cDead Man's Wire\u201d is just how elusive \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d can be.",

      "Some of the increase can be attributed to a change in the way viewers are counted. Nielsen began using its Big Data + Panel methodology for all events last September with the start of the current television season.",

      "Can they do it again",
      "When we first glimpse Noah Wyle\u2019s Michael Robinavitch \u2014 aka Dr. Robby, of course \u2014 in Season 2 of \u201cThe Pitt,\u201d he\u2019s looking darned good, truth be told. The beloved ER doc is riding his motorcycle to work, wearing nice shades, hair rustling in the early-morning Pittsburgh breeze.",
      "Wait \u2014 hair rustling? It\u2019s only then we notice what\u2019s missing. Can it be that Robby \u2014 dedicated, wise, overworked, charming and brilliant \u2014 isn\u2019t wearing a helmet?",
      "It\u2019s such a jarring sight that, launching a Zoom interview with Wyle, it\u2019s one of the first things we must inquire about. Did we remember that right? Were we supposed to notice?",
      "Yes and yes. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to notice that he doesn\u2019t wear it,\u201d Wyle confirms. \u201cBut then, he tells people that he does. Which means, you know he\u2019s lying. We don\u2019t know what else he\u2019s lying about.\u201d",
      "More broadly, it\u2019s all part of the goal this new season, after an impactful, Emmy-winning debut that culminated with a mass shooting. There were worries that they wouldn\u2019t be able to up the ante. Well, the idea is not to up the ante, Wyle says, but to more deeply explore characters and their issues.",
      "\u201cOur job isn't to come up with another stunt that creates drama to be the catalyst for excitement on the show,\u201d Wyle says. \u201cOur job is to be faithful to the characters that we\u2019ve initiated. To plot them in space and time in a real three-dimensional way, and allow their lives and what they\u2019re going through to generate the drama and the tension.\u201d",
      "Hence the no-helmet scene \u2014 a last-minute decision the night before. They'd planned for Robby to wear a helmet. But Wyle says he suggested to executive producer John Wells that if he didn\u2019t, \u201cWe won\u2019t know what to trust and what not to trust from that moment forward, and the audience will be privy to a secret that the characters around him aren\u2019t.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe dug it, so we went with that.\u201d",
      "The timing \u2013 July 4 \u2013 was hardly chosen haphazardly. Think holiday gatherings, fireworks, injuries we can imagine and worse ones we can\u2019t. But also, timing is important for the characters \u2014 it's been 10 months since last season's events.",
      "Dr. Frank Langdon has spent those months in rehab. The hard-driving senior resident with the much-noticed dimpled chin ran into serious trouble in the first season when he was caught stealing prescription meds to feed his addiction.",
      "Well, Frank\u2019s been given a reprieve, and he\u2019s on his first day back. Robby, for one, is not thrilled.",
      "But Patrick Ball, who plays Frank, is very relieved at his own reprieve. He'd been biting his nails as he awaited his character\u2019s fate.",
      "\u201cPretty much the entirety of my time on \u2018The Pitt\u2019 has been praying for a job and hoping I don\u2019t get fired,\u201d Ball quips. \u201cI was sweating pretty hard.\u201d He got the good news that he'd be back in a call from Wells, while walking on a rainy New York street.",
      "Katherine LaNasa, who plays all-knowing charge nurse Dana, had a similar sense of uncertainty. She was a breakout star of the first season, winning one of the show\u2019s five Emmys. But her character also seemed headed out the door, disillusioned by a brutal punch from an unruly patient.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m like, really, please don\u2019t get rid of me now!\u201d LaNasa says she thought. Happily, Dana too is back, taking charge as her title implies, with that sassy but maternal demeanor.",
      "\u201cI think of her as like a basketball coach,\u201d says LaNasa of Dana. \u201cShe\u2019s looking at what\u2019s going on, and what do people need to do their best? \u2026 I have children that are 24 years apart in age and so, I feel like I\u2019ve just been mothering my whole life.\u201d",

      "The comedian got the hosting gig last year after showing her skill at ruthlessly roasting celebrities. She got raves for her monologue. She brought out the knives, but they weren\u2019t overly sharp. She was promptly asked back.",
      "Sunday's monologue will be a shape-shifting monster until the moment the CBS telecast starts and she takes the stage at the Beverly Hilton, ideally with a bit ready for Roberts, who's nominated for best actress in a drama for \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d She'll be sitting in front of Glaser with her star-powered charm.",
      "\u201cI just want to do the perfect joke but it\u2019s like people do not have a sense of humor about Julia Roberts,\u201d Glaser said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cShe\u2019ll be fine \u2014 other people are not fine on her behalf. Like the most innocent joke about her that I made a couple times trying it out, they booed, they were like jeering.\u201d",

      "Zimbabwe\u2019s driving lessons have shifted from test prep to survival",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- When Tafara Muvhevhi, a Zimbabwean driving instructor, began work 16 years ago, his job was simple: teach the highway code and prepare learners to ace their driving test.",
      "Today, his priorities have changed. His main concern is no longer just the exam, but whether his students will survive some of the world\u2019s deadliest roads. This is vital in a country where road crashes rank among the top killers, according to the national statistics agency, and road accident fatality rates are among the continent's worst. In Zimbabwe, a crash hits every 15 minutes and five die and 38 are injured each day, according to the country's traffic safety agency.",
      "\u201cBack then we were teaching by the book, it was all by the book,\u201d Muvhevhi said while coaching his latest student through parallel parking and smooth reversing into spaces marked by blue drums on a dusty and worn-out tarmac training ground on the outskirts of the capital, Harare.",
      "Once known for orderly traffic and well-kept roads, Zimbabwe's road safety steadily has deteriorated since the 2000s, degenerating into traffic chaos in the 2010s as economic decline gutted road maintenance, informal public transport boomed and enforcement weakened. Despite renewed repairs and policing efforts, dangerous driving remains deeply entrenched.",
      "\"The other drivers are no longer patient with us, they hoot, they overtake illegally, putting pressure on the students so our students are basically trying to adjust,\u201d he said, before his student navigated through streets where both drivers and pedestrians have little regard for rules.",

      "\u201cYou cannot really compare it to accounting because (in accounting) you have all the concepts,\" Chipashu said. \u201cWhen you are driving in the jungle, you are confused by other people who are not following the road rules.\u201d",
      "The southern African nation\u2019s roads turn most lethal during festive seasons and other holidays, but peril lurks daily, driven largely by dangerous driving that the government says is of alarming concern.",
      "Zimbabwe has one of Africa\u2019s highest road accident fatality rates, with the World Health Organization estimating nearly 30 deaths per 100,000 people.",
      "On the roads, the contradictions are stark. Minibus taxis bearing \u201csafety first\u201d signs swerve wildly into pedestrian lanes and oncoming traffic. Fare collectors hang off doors and the back of moving vehicles shouting for customers. Sedans jammed with 12 passengers, including in the trunk, defy five-seat limits.",
      "Authorities say 94% of road accidents in the country of 15 million people are caused by human error. Cellphone distractions among drivers and pedestrians cause about 10% of deaths, said Munesu Munodawafa, head of the Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe.",

      "The WHO links the surge in part to weak road safety laws and enforcement, reckless driving, and rapid urbanization and motorization.

      "The leadership in Damascus under interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa had signed a deal in March last year with the SDF, which controls much of the northeast, for it to merge with the Syrian army by the end of 2025. There have been disagreements on how it would happen.",

      "The SDF has for years been the main U.S. partner in Syria in fighting against the Islamic State group, but Turkey considers the SDF a terrorist organization because of its association with the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, which has waged a long-running insurgency in Turkey. A peace process is now underway.",
      "Despite the long-running U.S. support for the SDF, the Trump administration in the U.S. has also developed close ties with al-Sharaa\u2019s government and has pushed the Kurds to implement the March deal.",

      "Iran's judiciary chief has vowed decisive punishment for protesters, signaling a coming crackdown against demonstrations",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iran\u2019s supreme leader signaled Friday that security forces would crack down on protesters, directly challenging U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to support those peacefully demonstrating.",
      "Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei dismissed Trump as having hands \u201cstained with the blood of Iranians\u201d as supporters shouted \u201cDeath to America!\u201d in footage aired by Iranian state television. State media later repeatedly referred to demonstrators as \u201cterrorists,\u201d setting the stage for a violent crackdown like those that have followed other nationwide protests in recent years.",
      "Protesters are \u201cruining their own streets ... in order to please the president of the United States,\u201d Khamenei said to a crowd at his compound in Tehran. \u201cBecause he said that he would come to their aid. He should pay attention to the state of his own country instead.\u201d",
      "Iran\u2019s judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei separately vowed that punishment for protesters \u201cwill be decisive, maximum and without any legal leniency.\u201d",
      "There was no immediate response from Washington, though Trump has repeated his pledge to strike Iran if protesters are killed, a threat that's taken on greater significance after the U.S. military raid that seized Venezuela's Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Despite Iran\u2019s theocracy cutting off the nation from the internet and international telephone calls, short online videos shared by activists purported to show protesters chanting against Iran\u2019s government around bonfires as debris littered the streets in the capital, Tehran, and other areas into Friday morning. Iranian state media alleged \u201cterrorist agents\u201d of the U.S. and Israel set fires and sparked violence. It also said there were \u201ccasualties,\u201d without elaborating.",
      "The full scope of the demonstrations couldn\u2019t be immediately determined due to the communications blackout, though it represented yet another escalation in protests that began over Iran\u2019s ailing economy and that has morphed into the most significant challenge to the government in several years. The protests have intensified steadily since beginning Dec. 28.",
      "The protests also represented the first test of whether the Iranian public could be swayed by Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, whose fatally ill father fled Iran just before the country\u2019s 1979 Islamic Revolution. Pahlavi, who called for the protests Thursday night, similarly has called for demonstrations at 8 p.m. Friday.",
      "Demonstrations have included cries in support of the shah, something that could bring a death sentence in the past but now underlines the anger fueling the protests that began over Iran\u2019s ailing economy.",
      "So far, violence around the demonstrations has killed at least 42 people while more than 2,270 others have been detained, said the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency.",
      "\u201cWhat turned the tide of the protests was former Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi\u2019s calls for Iranians to take to the streets at 8 p.m. on Thursday and Friday,\u201d said Holly Dagres, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cPer social media posts, it became clear that Iranians had delivered and were taking the call seriously to protest in order to oust the Islamic Republic.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is exactly why the internet was shut down: to prevent the world from seeing the protests. Unfortunately, it also likely provided cover for security forces to kill protesters.\u201d",
      "When the clock struck 8 p.m. Thursday, neighborhoods across Tehran erupted in chanting, witnesses said. The chants included \u201cDeath to the dictator!\u201d and \u201cDeath to the Islamic Republic!\u201d Others praised the shah, shouting: \u201cThis is the last battle! Pahlavi will return!\u201d Thousands could be seen on the streets before all communication to Iran cut out.",
      "\u201cIranians demanded their freedom tonight. In response, the regime in Iran has cut all lines of communication,\u201d Pahlavi said. \u201cIt has shut down the internet. It has cut landlines. It may even attempt to jam satellite signals.\u201d",

      "Pahlavi had said he would offer further plans depending on the response to his call.

Demonstrators have shouted in support of the shah in some demonstrations, but it isn\u2019t clear whether that\u2019s support for Pahlavi himself or a desire to return to a time before the 1979 Islamic Revolution.",
      "The internet cut also appears to have taken Iran\u2019s state-run and semiofficial news agencies offline as well. The state TV acknowledgment at 8 a.m. Friday represented the first official word about the demonstrations.",
      "State TV claimed the protests saw violence that caused casualties but did not elaborate. It also said the protests saw \u201cpeople\u2019s private cars, motorcycles, public places such as the metro, fire trucks and buses set on fire.\u201d State TV later reported that violence overnight killed six people in Hamedan, some 280 kilometers (175 miles) southwest of Tehran.",
      "Iran has faced rounds of nationwide protests in recent years. As sanctions tightened and Iran struggled after the 12-day war, its rial currency collapsed in December, reaching 1.4 million to $1. Protests began soon after, with demonstrators chanting against Iran\u2019s theocracy.",
      "It remains unclear why Iranian officials have yet to crack down harder on the demonstrators. Trump warned last week that if Tehran \u201cviolently kills peaceful protesters,\u201d America \u201cwill come to their rescue.\u201d",

      "Speaking in an interview with Sean Hannity aired Thursday night on Fox News, Trump went as far as to suggest 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei may be looking to leave Iran.",

      "MANILA, Philippines -- A massive crowd of mostly barefoot Filipino Catholics joined an annual procession of a centuries-old statue of Jesus Christ in the Philippine capital Friday, with some using the gathering to express outrage over a corruption scandal involving influential legislators.",
      "After a midnight mass joined by tens of thousands of worshippers at a seaside park in Manila, the wooden Jesus the Nazarene statue was placed on a four-wheel open carriage before dawn at the start of the procession that Manila Mayor Isko Moreno claimed could draw millions of devotees throughout the day and into the late night.",
      "One of Asia\u2019s major religious spectacles, the often-raucous procession of the life-size statue meanders through nearly six kilometers (3.7 miles) of Manila\u2019s congested narrow roads near the heavily guarded presidential palace. The procession is also a security nightmare for the authorities.",
      "About 15,000 police officers, backed by intelligence agents, were deployed to keep order. Authorities imposed a gun and liquor ban, prohibited drones and backpacks, and jammed cellphone signals along the route of the procession.",
      "First-aid tents manned by government and Red Cross medics were set up throughout the route, where more than 250 worshippers were treated for bruises and sprains by midday. An hour before the procession started, a Filipino photographer collapsed on a nearby sidewalk and appeared to be having difficulty breathing. He died while being brought to a hospital by medics, according to officials and two Associated Press journalists, who tried to assist the photographer.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of devotees, many wearing maroon shirts imprinted with images of the Nazarene, jostled and scrambled to get near the carriage carrying the statue by mid-morning. Many tried to climb up the carriage or threw small towels at volunteers on the carriage to wipe parts of the cross and the statue, in the belief that the Nazarene\u2019 figure would cure ailments and help provide good health, jobs and a better life.",
      "This year\u2019s Nazarene procession coincided with growing public outrage over a major corruption scandal, which erupted last year and implicated dozens of members of the House of Representative and the Senate who allegedly received huge kickbacks from construction companies. The scandal involved thousands of substandard or non-existent flood control projects across an archipelago that is prone to some of the deadliest flash floods in Asia.",

      "The life-size statue, crowned with thorns and bearing a cross, is believed to have been brought from Mexico to Manila on a galleon in 1606 by Spanish missionaries. The ship that carried it caught fire, but the charred statue survived. Some believe the statue\u2019s endurance, from fires and earthquakes through the centuries, and intense bombings during World War II, is a testament to what they say are mystical powers.",

      "President Donald Trump says he wants a one-year, 10% cap on credit card interest rates",
      "NEW YORK -- Reviving a campaign pledge, President Donald Trump wants a one-year, 10% cap on credit card interest rates, a move that could save Americans tens of billions of dollars but drew immediate opposition from an industry that has been in his corner.",
      "Trump was not clear in his social media post Friday night whether a cap might take effect through executive action or legislation, though one Republican senator said he had spoken with the president and would work on a bill with his \u201cfull support.\u201d Trump said he hoped it would be in place Jan. 20, one year after he took office.",
      "Strong opposition is certain from Wall Street in addition to the credit card companies, which donated heavily to his 2024 campaign and have supported Trump's second-term agenda. Banks are making the argument that such a plan would most hurt poor people, at a time of economic concern, by curtailing or eliminating credit lines, driving them to high-cost alternatives like payday loans or pawnshops.",
      "\u201cWe will no longer let the American Public be ripped off by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%,\u201d Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.",
      "Researchers who studied Trump\u2019s campaign pledge after it was first announced found that Americans would save roughly $100 billion in interest a year if credit card rates were capped at 10%. The same researchers found that while the credit card industry would take a major hit, it would still be profitable, although credit card rewards and other perks might be scaled back.",
      "About 195 million people in the United States had credit cards in 2024 and were assessed $160 billion in interest charges, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau says. Americans are now carrying more credit card debt than ever, to the tune of about $1.23 trillion, according to figures from the New York Federal Reserve for the third quarter last year.",
      "Further, Americans are paying, on average, between 19.65% and 21.5% in interest on credit cards according to the Federal Reserve and other industry tracking sources. That has come down in the past year as the central bank lowered benchmark rates, but is near the highs since federal regulators started tracking credit card rates in the mid-1990s. That\u2019s significantly higher than a decade ago, when the average credit card interest rate was roughly 12%.",
      "The Republican administration has proved particularly friendly until now to the credit card industry.",
      "Capital One got little resistance from the White House when it finalized its purchase and merger with Discover Financial in early 2025, a deal that created the nation\u2019s largest credit card company. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is largely tasked with going after credit card companies for alleged wrongdoing, has been largely nonfunctional since Trump took office.",
      "In a joint statement, the banking industry was opposed to Trump's proposal.",
      "\u201cIf enacted, this cap would only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives,\" the American Bankers Association and allied groups said.",
      "Bank lobbyists have long argued that lowering interest rates on their credit card products would require the banks to lend less to high-risk borrowers. When Congress enacted a cap on the fee that stores pay large banks when customers use a debit card, banks responded by removing all rewards and perks from those cards. Debit card rewards only recently have trickled back into consumers' hands. For example, United Airlines now has a debit card that gives miles with purchases.",
      "The U.S. already places interest rate caps on some financial products and for some demographics. The Military Lending Act makes it illegal to charge active-duty service members more than 36% for any financial product. The national regulator for credit unions has capped interest rates on credit union credit cards at 18%.",

      "Credit card companies earn three streams of revenue from their products: fees charged to merchants, fees charged to customers and the interest charged on balances. The argument from some researchers and left-leaning policymakers is that the banks earn enough revenue from merchants to keep them profitable if interest rates were capped.",
      "\"A 10% credit card interest cap would save Americans $100 billion a year without causing massive account closures, as banks claim. That\u2019s because the few large banks that dominate the credit card market are making absolutely massive profits on customers at all income levels,\" said Brian Shearer, director of competition and regulatory policy at the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator, who wrote the research on the industry's impact of Trump's proposal last year.",
      "There are some historic examples that interest rate caps do cut off the less creditworthy to financial products because banks are not able to price risk correctly. Arkansas has a strictly enforced interest rate cap of 17% and evidence points to the poor and less creditworthy being cut out of consumer credit markets in the state. Shearer's research showed that an interest rate cap of 10% would likely result in banks lending less to those with credit scores below 600.",
      "The White House did not respond to questions about how the president seeks to cap the rate or whether he has spoken with credit card companies about the idea.",
      "Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., who said he talked with Trump on Friday night, said the effort is meant to \u201clower costs for American families and to reign in greedy credit card companies who have been ripping off hardworking Americans for too long.\"",

China views self-governed Taiwan as its sovereign territory and has said it would take it by force if needed. It staged large-scale military exercises nearby late last month.",

The Japanese news agency Kyodo reported that outgoing shipments of sake and processed food from Japan to China were being held up because of the diplomatic tensions, widening the ripples of the dispute.",
      "Officials at the government-affiliated Japan External Trade Organization told The Associated Press that the shipments had been delayed in customs on the China side starting in late November.

The nations have fought two wars, and the imperial government in Tokyo brutally occupied parts of China in the first half of the 20th century. The countries maintain diplomatic relations and work closely together on many fronts but occasionally use government apparatus to condemn each other when disputes arise.",

GDP growth is then set to slow to an average of 1.8% in 2027 and 2028 as fiscal support wanes and labor force growth slows.

      "Toilet paper, a product that is used for a few seconds before being disposed of forever, is typically made with trees, energy-intensive manufacturing processes and chemicals that can pollute the environment.",
      "Experts say more consumers are seeking toilet paper made from recycled content or sustainable materials, but it can be hard to know what to look for.",
      "Sustainable toilet paper often costs more, but can have significant environmental benefits. According to the Environmental Paper Network, a coalition of nonprofits, more than 1 billion gallons (3.8 billion liters) of water and 1.6 million trees could be saved if every American used one roll of toilet paper made from recycled content instead of a roll made from forest fibers.",
      "Here are some recommendations for buying sustainable toilet paper or reducing overall toilet paper use.",
      "North American toilet paper has traditionally been made from fibers from trees in Canada and eucalyptus plantations in Brazil. Pulp made from the trees is bleached to create a bright white color, but the chlorine that's often used can hurt the environment. Large amounts of electricity and heat are used to remove moisture and form square sheets.",
      "Increasingly, manufacturers are making toilet paper from recycled paper products, which avoids material from freshly cut trees, and are using chlorine-free bleaching techniques. Once used, toilet paper itself is flushed and not recycled.",
      "Looking for recycled content is a good place for environmentally conscious consumers to start, said Gary Bull, professor emeritus of forest economics at the University of British Columbia. Preconsumer materials include scrap materials from manufacturing or unsold paper. Postconsumer materials come from paper products that have already been used.",
      "Making toilet paper from postconsumer recycled fibers improves its sustainability because paper is \u201cone of the easiest materials on the planet to recycle,\u201d Bull said.",
      "The best way for a scientist to evaluate the carbon footprint of an item is doing a life cycle assessment, which calculates the environmental impacts from when a tree is a seedling to when its fibers are converted into toilet paper and flushed down the drain, Bull said. But that method isn't within reach of consumers, so advocates have undertaken third-party assessments.",
      "Some companies add those labels to packaging to show that their processes have been vetted. Bull said labels on bath tissue from the Forest Stewardship Council or the Sustainable Forestry Initiative indicate the company is making scientifically-proven efforts to be sustainable. Both groups' standards include conserving water, wildlife, and biodiversity as well as compliance with applicable forestry laws to keep ecosystems healthy.",
      "The nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council also publishes an annual report that grades toilet papers from A+ to F, with the highest-ranked products being unbleached or bleached without chlorine, containing recycled content and avoiding harmful forestry practices. Aria, Green Forest, Natural Value, Trader Joe's and Whole Foods 365 100% Recycled received the highest letter grade in 2025, with all made entirely from recycled materials.",
      "The \u201cThe Issue with Tissue\u201d report was launched in 2019, and NRDC corporate campaign advocate Ashley Jordan said she has noticed dozens of sustainable toilet paper brands have emerged over the last six years.",

      "\u201cIf more people are buying sustainable toilet paper and demanding it, there should be economies of scale and prices should fall to match that of conventional toilet paper,\u201d he said.",
      "Mark Pitts, executive director of tissue at the American Forest & Paper Association, whose members include large toilet paper manufacturers such as Kimberly-Clark Corporation and Georgia-Pacific, told The Associated Press that sustainability is a core industry focus and members have reported reductions of greenhouse gas emissions along the supply chain. He said that members follow responsible forestry practices and have increased their use of recycled material.",
      "Alternative materials such as fast-growing bamboo are often billed as more sustainable than toilet paper made from trees, but consumers should focus on toilet paper made with recycled materials instead, said Ronalds Gonzalez, an associate professor at North Carolina State University and expert on fibers used in the hygiene industry.",
      "Gonzalez said pollution from manufacturing processes can reduce the benefits of using bamboo. Gonzalez recently co-authored a study that found bamboo toilet paper made in China that is available in the U.S. had a higher environmental impact than toilet paper made in the U.S. with imported forest fibers, largely because Chinese manufacturers use electricity generated by coal. The study found the bamboo toilet paper\u2019s environmental impacts could be reduced when it was produced in regions that use renewable energy.",

Some bidets require a plumber or contractor to install.",

      "Wednesday saw the most-intense day of demonstrations, reaching rural towns and major cities in every province though still localized enough for daily life to continue in Tehran, Iran's capital, and elsewhere. So far, violence around the demonstrations has killed at least 38 people while more than 2,200 others have been detained, said the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency.",
      "The growth of the protests increases the pressure on Iran's civilian government and its Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. So far, authorities haven't shut down the internet or fully flooded the streets with security forces like they did to put down the 2022 Mahsa Amini demonstrations. But any intensification may seem them act.",
      "Meanwhile, the protests themselves have remained broadly leaderless, though a call for protests by Iran's exiled crown prince will test whether or not demonstrators are being swayed by messages from abroad.",
      "\u201cThe lack of a viable alternative has undermined past protests in Iran,\u201d wrote Nate Swanson of the Washington-based Atlantic Council, who studies Iran.",
      "\u201cThere may be a thousand Iranian dissident activists who, given a chance, could emerge as respected statesmen, as labor leader Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa did in Poland at the end of the Cold War. But so far, the Iranian security apparatus has arrested, persecuted and exiled all of the country\u2019s potential transformational leaders.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, at least 37 protests took place across the country, activists said. They included Shiraz, where online videos purported to show an anti-riot truck using a water cannon to target demonstrators. The state-run IRNA news agency, which has largely been silent about the demonstrations, reported on a mass demonstration in Bojnourd, as well as demonstrations in Kerman and Kermanshah.",
      "Iranian officials have offered no acknowledgment of the scale of the protests. However, there has been reporting regarding security officials being hurt or killed. The judiciary's Mizan news agency report a police colonel suffered fatal stab wounds in a town outside of Tehran, while the semiofficial Fars news agency said gunmen killed two security force members and wounded 30 others in a shooting in the city of Lordegan in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province.",
      "Demonstrations continued Thursday, with merchants closing their shops in Iran\u2019s Kurdistan province.",
      "It remains unclear why Iranian officials have yet to crack down harder on the demonstrators. U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s warned last week that if Tehran \u201cviolently kills peaceful protesters,\u201d America \u201cwill come to their rescue.\u201d",

      "But those comments haven't stopped the U.S. State Department on the social platform X from highlighting online footage purporting to show demonstrators putting up stickers naming roads after Trump or throwing away government-subsidized rice.",
      "\u201cWhen prices are set so high that neither consumers can afford to buy nor farmers can afford to sell, everyone loses,\u201d the State Department said in one message. \u201cIt makes no difference if this rice is thrown away.\u201d",
      "The demonstrations so far broadly appear to be leaderless, like other rounds of protests in Iran in recent years. However, Iran's exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, the son of the late shah, has urged the public in Iran to shout from their windows and roofs on Thursday and Friday nights at 8 p.m. (1630 GMT).",
      "\u201cWherever you are, whether in the streets or even from your own homes, I call on you to begin chanting exactly at this time,\u201d Pahlavi said in an online video that's also been promoted by Iranian satellite news channels abroad. \u201cBased on your response, I will announce the next calls to action.\u201d",
      "Whether people take part will be a sign of possible support for Pahlavi, whose support of and from Israel has drawn criticism in the past \u2014 particularly after the 12-day war Israel waged on Iran in June. Demonstrators have shouted in support of the shah in some demonstrations, but it isn't clear whether that's support for Pahlavi or a desire to return to a time before the 1979 Islamic Revolution.",
      "Meanwhile, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi remains imprisoned by authorities after her arrest in December.",
      "\u201cSince Dec. 28, 2025, the people of Iran have taken to the streets, just as they did in 2009, 2019,\u201d her son Ali Rahmani said. \u201cEach time, the same demands came up: an end to the Islamic Republic, an end to this patriarchal, dictatorial and religious regime, the end of the clerics, the end of the mullahs' regime.\u201d",
      "Iran has faced rounds of nationwide protests in recent years. As sanctions tightened and Iran struggled after a 12-day war with Israel in June, its rial currency collapsed in December, reaching 1.4 million to $1. Protests began soon after, with demonstrators chanting against Iran\u2019s theocracy.",
      "Prior to Iran\u2019s 1979 Islamic Revolution, the rial was broadly stable, trading at around 70 to $1. At the time of Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, $1 traded for 32,000 rials. Shops in markets across the country have shut down as part of the protests.",
      "This round of protests has yet to reach the level of the months of protests surrounding the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody in 2022. Amini was detained over not wearing her hijab, or headscarf, to the liking of authorities. Her death became a rallying cry for women who continue to refuse to wear the hijab.",

      "They\u2019re at it again",
      "BEIJING -- They\u2019re at it again.",
      "China and Japan \u2014 frenemies, trading partners and uneasy neighbors with a tortured, bloody history they still struggle to navigate \u2014 are freshly at each other\u2019s rhetorical throats as 2026 begins. And it\u2019s over the same sticking points that have kept them resentful and suspicious for many decades: Japan\u2019s occupation of parts of China in the 20th century, the use of military power in East Asia, economics and politics \u2014 and, of course, pride.",
      "From insinuations that Chinese citizens face dangers in Japan to outright accusations of resurgent Japanese imperialism, this first week of the year in China has been marked by the communist government scorning Tokyo on multiple fronts and noticeably embracing the visiting leader of another crucial strategic neighbor: South Korea.",
      "The latest chapter in Japan-China enmity surged In November when Japan's new leader waded into choppy bilateral waters. She said, in effect, that if China moved militarily against Taiwan, she wouldn't rule out involving Japan's constitutionally defense-only military. That didn't go over well in Beijing, which has teed off on Tokyo over the years for far less.",
      "\u201cPrime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s erroneous remarks concerning Taiwan infringe upon China\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity, blatantly interfere in China\u2019s internal affairs, and send a military threat against China,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Wednesday, a week after military exercises around the island ended. \u201cWe urge Japan to face up to the root causes of the issue, reflect and correct its mistakes.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s hardly uncommon language. China frequently demands Japan ponder the path it has taken and correct its \u201cerroneous\u201d course. It's rhetoric, sure, but it goes far deeper. And sometimes it's hard to tell what's real umbrage and what's ginned up for domestic political consumption.",
      "Because when it comes to the China-Japan relationship, anger remains a powerful and enduring tool on both sides. And there's no indication that's going away anytime soon.",
      "From the time Japan colonized Taiwan in 1895 after a war with Qing Dynasty China, a deep suspicion and at times outright enmity has existed between the two countries.",
      "It worsened in the 1920s and 1930s after Japan\u2019s brutal occupation of parts of China resulted in torture and deaths that Chinese resent to this day. At the same time, Japanese leaders have sometimes thrown incendiary political footballs like visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, a memorial to Japanese who gave their lives in the nation\u2019s wars \u2014 including some war criminals from the Sino-Japanese wars. China, like clockwork, responds with indignation.",
      "Japan lost World War II to the Allied powers and relinquished offensive military powers under a U.S.-drafted constitution, even as the current communist Chinese government was establishing the People\u2019s Republic in 1949. Since then, any hint of Japanese military assertiveness has drawn great umbrage here. Disputes over territory, such as an island chain called Diaoyu by China and Senkaku by Japan, spike occasionally.",
      "The enmity, pulled out when something is perceived as aggressive or anger is required for a domestic audience, lurks barely beneath the surface, ready to pop. Even today, cartoons circulate online in China depicting Japanese as demonic, aggressive and anti-China.",
      "This week has been an illuminating case study.",
      "On Tuesday, China slapped restrictions on \u201cdual-use exports\u201d to Japan \u2014 anything, it said, that Japan could adapt for military use. Though it didn't specify what the ban includes, anything from drones to rare earths could be considered dual-use. The lack of specificity allows China to adjust its approach as it goes \u2014 making it more or less strict depending on where the political winds are blowing.",
      "Japan demanded the move be rescinded. \u201cThese measures, which only target Japan, deviate significantly from international practice,\u201d its Foreign Ministry said, calling China's actions \u201cabsolutely unacceptable and deeply regrettable.\u201d This came days after it protested Chinese mobile drilling rigs in the East China Sea.",

      "On Wednesday, the focus turned to a gas called dichlorosilane, used in computer chip manufacturing. The Commerce Ministry said it had launched an investigation into why the price of dichlorosilane imported from Japan had decreased 31% between 2022 and 2024. \u201cThe dumping of imported products from Japan has damaged the production and operation of our domestic industry,\u201d it said.",
      "Finally, on Thursday, China's Arms Control and Disarmament Association, a nongovernment agency (inasmuch as any agency in China is nongovernmental) released with some fanfare a report provocatively titled \u201cNuclear Ambitions of Japan's Right-Wing Forces: A Serious Threat to World Peace.\u201d It spent 29 pages outlining worries and accusations that Tokyo harbors dangerous nuclear ambitions.",
      "But it also went broader, invoking once again its stance that the nation's right-wing leaders \u2014 and, by extension, the whole country itself \u2014 have \u201cfailed to reflect on Japan's history of aggression.\u201d",
      "\u201cJapan has never been able to fully eliminate the scourge of militarism in the country,\u201d the report said. \u201cIf Japan's right-wing forces are left free to develop powerful offensive weapons, or even possess nuclear weapons, it will again bring disaster to the world.\u201d",
      "Also part of the equation this week: China's visible pivot to another regional neighbor, South Korea, whose president spent four days in Beijing. Seoul has a bumpy history of its own with Japanese aggression and also sporadic \u2014 though generally less intense \u2014 friction with Beijing, a longtime supporter and ally of its rival North Korea.",
      "Chinese media gave splashy coverage to Lee Jae Myung's visit, touting new Beijing-Seoul agreements on trade, environmental protection and transportation \u2014 and notably technology, given the dual-export ban. Also visible: Lee at two business events watching major companies pledge increased collaboration. The sides signed 24 export contracts worth a combined $44 million, according to South Korea\u2019s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Resources.",
      "The burst of official affection toward South Korea didn't stop with Lee. While he was here, Chinese media reported that South Korea overtook Japan as the leading destination for outbound flights from the mainland over New Year\u2019s. That's on top of Beijing's recent efforts to discourage Chinese from traveling to Japan, citing \u201csignificant risks to the personal safety and lives of Chinese citizens\u201d there.",
      "For now, Japan-China tension remains a matter of rhetoric and policy. But no one is predicting a quick resolution. With Japan's staunch ally, the United States, planning to furnish more arms to Taiwan in a single sale than ever before, there's too much at stake for both East Asian nations at this moment \u2014 and too much contentious history \u2014 for an easy and quick solution.",
      "\"This time ... de-escalation and a return to the status quo may not be as easily achieved,\" Sebastian Maslow, an East Asia specialist and associate professor of international relations at the University of Tokyo, wrote in The Conversation last month. \u201cWith diplomatic channels in short supply and domestic political agendas paramount, an off-ramp for the current dispute is not in sight.\u201d",

      "The three-time reigning world champions, performing a flamenco-style dance to a version of the Rolling Stones hit \u201cPaint It Black\u201d from the dystopian sci-fi Western show \u201cWestworld,\u201d produced a season-best free skate and finished with 228.87 points.",
      "Emilea Zingas and Vadym Kolesnik were second with 213.65 points and Christina Carreira and Anthony Ponomarenko were third with 206.95, making those two pairs the likely choices to join Chock and Bates on the American squad for the upcoming Winter Games.",
      "U.S. Figure Skating will announce its selections on Sunday.",
      "\u201cThe feeling that we got from the audience today was unlike anything I've ever felt before,\u201d said Chock, who along with Bates helped the Americans win team gold at the Beijing Olympics four years ago, but finished a disappointing fourth in the ice dance.",
      "They'll be the heavy favorites to win gold next month in Italy.",
      "\u201cI felt so much love and joy,\u201d Chock continued, \"and I'm so grateful for this moment.\u201d",
      "The men's medals also were to be decided on Saturday, though two-time world champion Ilia Malinin had built such a lead after his short program that the self-styled \u201cQuad God\u201d would have to stumble mightily to miss out on a fourth consecutive title.",
      "The real question is who will join Malinin on the Olympic team.",
      "The U.S. also has qualified the maximum of three men's spots for the Winter Games, and competition is tight between second-place Tomoko Hiwatashi, fan favorite Jason Brown, Andrew Torgashev and Maxim Naumov to round out the nationals podium.",
      "There wasn't much drama in the dance competition.",

And while they only finished fifth, the sister-brother duo of Oona Brown and Gage Brown \u2014 former world junior champions \u2014 earned the first standing ovation of the night for their moody, creative program set to selections from the film \u201cThe Godfather.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think that was one of the best \u2014 if not the best \u2014 performances we've had,\u201d Gage Brown said afterward.",
      "The Browns ended a stretch in which most of the couples taking the ice made some kind of significant mistake.",
      "Then it was a parade of near-perfect programs, each couple trying to upstage the previous one.",
      "Emily Bratti and Ian Somerville were the first to knock the Brown siblings from first place, then reigning bronze medalists Caroline Green and Michael Parsons took over first place with their program, set to \u201cEscalate\u201d by Tsar B and \u201cSon of Nyx\u201d by Hozier.",
      "Carreira and Ponomarenko, the back-to-back U.S. silver medalists, knew that a podium spot would probably earn them a spot on the Olympic team. And they delivered with a sharp program inside the Enterprise Center in which the seemed to channel the characters from the 2006 psychological thriller film \u201cPerfume: The Story of a Murder.\u201d",
      "The 23-year-old Zingas and 24-year-old Kolesnik quickly assumed the top spot, but with Chock and Bates warming up on the ice as their scores were read, they knew it would probably be about a 4-minute stay in first place.",

    "story": [
      "Doctors fear this week\u2019s unprecedented changes to federal vaccine recommendations will stoke vaccine hesitancy even more, pose challenges for pediatricians and parents and ultimately lead to more illness and death among children",
      "Dr. Molly O\u2019Shea has noticed growing skepticism about vaccines at both of her Michigan pediatric offices and says this week's unprecedented and confusing changes to federal vaccine guidance will only make things worse.",
      "One of her offices is in a Democratic area, where more of the parents she sees are opting for alternative schedules that spread out shots. The other is in a Republican area, where some parents have stopped immunizing their children altogether.",
      "She and other doctors fear the new recommendations and the terminology around them will stoke vaccine hesitancy even more, pose challenges for pediatricians and parents that make it harder for kids to get shots, and ultimately lead to more illness and death.",
      "The biggest change was to stop blanket recommendations for protection against six diseases and recommend those vaccines only for at-risk children or through something called \u201cshared clinical decision-making\u201d with a health care provider.",
      "The phrase, experts say, is confusing and dangerous: \u201cIt sends a message to a parent that actually there\u2019s only a rarefied group of people who really need the vaccine,\u201d O\u2019Shea said. \u201cIt\u2019s creating an environment that puts a sense of uncertainty about the value and necessity or importance of the vaccines in that category.\u201d",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who helped lead the anti-vaccine movement for years, said in announcing the changes that they better align the U.S. with peer nations \u201cwhile strengthening transparency and informed consent.\u201d",
      "But doctors say they are sowing doubt \u2014 the vaccines have been extensively studied and proven to be safe and effective at shielding kids from nasty diseases \u2014 at a time when childhood vaccination rates are already falling and some of those infectious diseases are spreading.",
      "On Friday, the American Academy of Pediatrics and more than 200 medical, public health and patient advocacy groups sent a letter to Congress about the new childhood immunization schedule.",
      "\u201cWe urge you to investigate why the schedule was changed, why credible scientific evidence was ignored, and why the committee charged with advising the HHS Secretary on immunizations did not discuss the schedule changes as a part of their public meeting process,\" they wrote.",
      "O\u2019Shea said she and other pediatricians discuss vaccines with parents at every visit where they are given. But that\u2019s not necessarily \u201cshared clinical decision-making,\u201d which has a particular definition.",
      "On its website, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices says: \u201cUnlike routine, catch-up, and risk-based recommendations, shared clinical decision-making vaccinations are not recommended for everyone in a particular age group or everyone in an identifiable risk group. Rather, shared clinical decision-making recommendations are individually based and informed by a decision process between the health care provider and the patient or parent/guardian.\u201d",
      "In this context, health care providers include primary care physicians, specialists, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, registered nurses and pharmacists.",
      "A pair of surveys conducted last year by the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania suggested that many people don\u2019t fully understand the concept, which came up last year when the federal government changed recommendations around COVID-19 vaccinations.",
      "Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults knew that one meaning behind shared decision-making is that \u201ctaking the vaccine may not be a good idea for everyone but would benefit some.\u201d And only about one-third realized pharmacists count as health care providers to talk with during the process, even though they frequently administer vaccines.",
      "As of this week, vaccines that protect against hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rotavirus, RSV, flu and meningococcal disease are no longer universally recommended for kids. RSV, hepatitis A, hepatitis B and meningococcal vaccines are recommended for certain high-risk populations; flu, rotavirus, hepatitis A, hepatitis B and meningococcal vaccines are recommended through shared decision-making \u2014 as is the COVID-19 vaccine, although that change was made last year.",
      "Shortly after the federal announcement Monday, Dr. Steven Abelowitz heard from half a dozen parents. \u201cIt\u2019s causing concern for us, but more importantly, concern for parents with kids, especially young kids, and confusion,\u201d said Abelowitz, founder of Ocean Pediatrics in Orange County, California.",

      "Though federal recommendations are not mandates \u2014 states have the authority to require vaccinations for schoolchildren \u2014 they can affect how easy it is for kids to get shots if doctors choose to follow them.",
      "Under the new guidelines, O'Shea said, parents seeking shots in the shared decision-making category might no longer bring their kids in for a quick, vaccine-only appointment with staff. They'd sit down with a health care provider and discuss the vaccine. And it could be tougher to have a flu clinic, where parents drive up and kids get shots without seeing a doctor.",
      "Still, doctors say they won\u2019t let the changes stop them from helping children get the vaccines they need. Leading medical groups are sticking with prior vaccine recommendations. Many parents are, too.",
      "Megan Landry, whose 4-year-old son Zackary is one of O\u2019Shea\u2019s patients, is among them.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my responsibility as a parent to protect my child\u2019s health and well-being,\u201d she said. \u201cVaccines are a really effective and well-studied way to do that.\u201d",
      "She plans to keep having the same conversations she\u2019s always had with O\u2019Shea before getting vaccines for Zackary.",
      "\u201cRelying on evidence and trusted medical guidance really helps me to make those decisions,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd for me, it\u2019s not just a personal choice for my own son but a way to contribute to the health of everybody.\u201d",
      "But for other families, confidence about vaccines is waning as trust in science erodes. O'Shea lamented that parents are getting the message that they can't trust medical experts.",

      "Abelowitz, the California doctor, likened the latest federal move to pouring gasoline on a fire of mistrust that was already burning.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re worried the fire\u2019s out of control,\u201d he said. \u201cAlready we\u2019ve seen that with measles and pertussis, there are increased hospitalizations and even increasing deaths.

Cisco argues it isn\u2019t liable under those laws, the 18th-century Alien Tort Statute (ATS) or the Torture Victim Protection Act (TVPA), first enacted in 1991.",
      "In recent years, the Supreme Court and presidential administrations of both parties have been skeptical of lawsuits seeking to use U.S. courts as a venue to seek justice over the acts of foreign governments, especially those that took place abroad. To try to overcome that skepticism, Falun Gong members have argued that a substantial portion of Cisco\u2019s activities involving China took place in the United States.",

      "DeepSeek, a Chinese tech startup, is gaining traction in developing nations, narrowing the AI adoption gap with advanced economies",
      "HONG KONG -- DeepSeek, the Chinese tech startup that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT, has been gaining ground in many developing nations in a trend that could narrow the gap of artificial intelligence adoption with advanced economies, a new report suggested.",
      "In the Thursday report, researchers from Microsoft said global adoption of generative AI tools reached 16.3% of the world\u2019s population in the three months to December, up from 15.1% in the previous three months.",
      "Yet the divide of AI adoption in developed and developing countries is widening, the report noted, with AI adoption across advanced economies growing nearly twice as fast as developing nations.",
      "\u201cWe are seeing a divide and we are concerned that that divide will continue to widen,\u201d said Juan Lavista Ferres, chief data scientist for Microsoft's AI for Good Lab, which used anonymized \u201ctelemetry\u201d to help track global device usage.",
      "Countries that invested early and consistently in digital infrastructure and AI led in terms of shares of users, including the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, France and Spain, according to the report. Some of Microsoft's figures overlapped with the findings of a Pew Research Center survey published in October that mapped which countries are more excited than concerned about AI. In both reports, for instance, South Korea stood out in its embrace of AI.",
      "Microsoft has a vested interest in AI adoption \u2014 its business and much of the tech industry and stock market is staking its future on AI tools becoming more widely used and profitable \u2014 but Lavista Ferres said his lab is looking more broadly at the topic.",
      "His researchers found that the rise of Chinese startup DeepSeek, which was founded in 2023, has fueled wider AI adoption across the developing world given its free and \u201copen source\u201d models \u2013 with key components available for anyone to access and modify.",
      "When DeepSeek released its advanced reasoning AI model called R1 in January 2025, which it said was more cost-effective than OpenAI\u2019s similar model, it raised eyebrows in the global technology industry and many were surprised by how China is catching up with the U.S. in technological advancements. Leading science journal Nature published peer-reviewed research co-authored by DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng in September, describing it as a \u201clandmark paper\u201d from the Chinese startup.",
      "Lavista Ferres said DeepSeek is a \u201cgood model\u201d for tasks like math or coding, but it operates differently from U.S.-based models on topics like politics.",
      "\u201cWe have observed that for certain type of questions, of course, they follow the same type of access to the internet that China has,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich means that there will be questions that will be answered very differently, particularly political questions. In many ways that can have an influence on the world.\u201d",
      "DeepSeek offers a free\u2011to\u2011use chatbot on web and mobile, and has also given developers global access to modify and build on its core engine. Its lack of subscription fees has \"lowered the barrier for millions of users, especially in price\u2011sensitive regions,\u201d Microsoft's report said.",

      "A federal judge on Wednesday indicated a jury will be allowed to decide whether artificial intelligence trailblazer OpenAI hoodwinked its billionaire co-founder Elon Musk during its evolution from a nonprofit research lab into a capitalistic enterprise now valued at $500 billion.",
      "Without issuing an official ruling, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers made it clear that she intended to reject OpenAI's motion to dismiss a 17-month-old case that Musk filed against a San Francisco startup that he helped create in 2015.",
      "\u201cThis case is going to trial,\u201d Gonzalez Rogers said emphatically during an occasionally testy 90-minute hearing held in Oakland, California.",
      "The judge said she still needed to figure out some of the logistics of how the trial will be set up, as well as whether to dismiss unjust enrichment allegations that Musk has made against Microsoft, which has accumulated a $135 billion stake in OpenAI since investing $1 billion in a for-profit subsidiary that the startup created in 2019.",
      "But the judge told lawyers that there is sufficient evidence for a jury to consider in a legal showdown pitting Musk \u2014 the world's richest man with an estimated fortune of $713 billion \u2014 against OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, whose fortune is currently pegged at $2 billion. Both billionaires would likely be summoned to court to testify under oath if the trial proceeds.",
      "\u201cPart of this is about whether a jury believes the people who will testify and whether they are credible,\u201d Gonzalez Rogers said.",
      "It's unclear when the judge will schedule the trial.",
      "The case revolves around OpenAI's origins as a nonprofit research lab that Musk and Altman launched to develop artificial intelligence designed primarily for the good of humanity. That mission, the two founders believed, could serve as a foil to AI being developed by Google and other profit-driven companies that, they claimed, could deploy the technology recklessly as they strived to make more money.",
      "Musk contributed $40 million, mostly funneled through donor-advised funds that he had set up, in addition to four Tesla vehicles. Then he and Altman had a falling out over OpenAI's future, according to evidence that has surfaced so far.",

      "At that point, Musk began to suspect that Altman and another OpenAI executive, Greg Brockman, might be plotting to transform the research lab into a profit-seeking company, according to evidence submitted to the the judge.",
      "Although Altman sought to reassure Musk he remained committed to OpenAI's non-profit mission, Musk decided to cut ties with the startup and eventually launched a rival, xAI, that was valued at $230 billion in a just-completed fundraising.",
      "A 2017 diary entry by OpenAI's Brockman was among the information that Gonzalez Rogers cited to support her rationale for allowing Musk's lawsuit to go to trial.",
      "In the diary, Brockman mused about his desire to become a billionaire and wrote, \u201cWe\u2019ve been thinking that maybe we should just flip to a for profit. Making the money for us sounds great and all,\u201d according to court filings.",
      "At one point, OpenAI's own board of directors had serious enough misgivings about Altman's motives to trigger his firing in 2023 before quickly bringing him back as CEO in a comeback that Microsoft helped orchestrate.",
      "One of the key issues that must be decided before Musk can pursue his fraud claims against OpenAI at trial is pinpointing when the alleged deceit occurred. That's because there's a three-year statute of limitations on his fraud claims.",
      "Gonzalez Rogers indicated she will probably let a jury first decide when the alleged fraud against Musk occurred. The trial then would be allowed to proceed to the fraud phase if it's determined that the suspected deceit began less than three years before Musk's August 2024 filing of his lawsuit.",

      "He said it is too early to tell if Mayon\u2019s restiveness would worsen and lead to a major and violent eruption given the absence of other key signs of unrest, like a spike in volcanic earthquakes and high levels of sulfur dioxide emissions.",

      "On Tuesday, Britain's top technology official demanded that Musk's social media platform X take urgent action while a Polish lawmaker cited it as a reason to enact digital safety laws.",
      "The European Union's executive arm has denounced Grok while officials and regulators in France, India, Malaysia and Brazil have condemned the platform and called for investigations.",
      "Rising alarm from disparate nations points to the nightmarish potential of nudification apps that use artificial intelligence to generate sexually explicit deepfake images.",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look:",
      "The problem emerged after the launch last year of Grok Imagine, an AI image generator that allows users to create videos and pictures by typing in text prompts. It includes a so-called \u201cspicy mode\u201d that can generate adult content.",
      "It snowballed late last month when Grok, which is hosted on X, apparently began granting a large number of user requests to modify images posted by others. As of Tuesday, Grok users could still generate images of women using requests such as, \u201cput her in a transparent bikini.\u201d",
      "The problem is amplified both because Musk pitches his chatbot as an edgier alternative to rivals with more safeguards, and because Grok's images are publicly visible, and can therefore be easily spread.",
      "Nonprofit group AI Forensics said in a report that it analyzed 20,000 images generated by Grok between Dec. 25 and Jan. 1 and found that 2% depicted a person who appeared to be 18 or younger, including 30 of young or very young women or girls, in bikinis or transparent clothes.",
      "Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, responded to a request for comment with the automated response, \u201cLegacy Media Lies\u201d.",
      "However, X did not deny that the troublesome content generated through Grok exists. Yet it still claimed in a post on its Safety account, that it takes action against illegal content, including child sexual abuse material, \u201cby removing it, permanently suspending accounts, and working with local governments and law enforcement as necessary.\"",
      "The platform also repeated a comment from Musk, who said, \u201cAnyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.\u201d",
      "A growing list of countries are demanding that Musk does more to rein in explicit or abusive content.",
      "X must \u201curgently\u201d deal with the problem, Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said Tuesday, adding that she supported additional scrutiny from the U.K.\u2019s communications regulator, Ofcom.",
      "Kendall said the content is \u201cabsolutely appalling, and unacceptable in decent society.\"",
      "\u201cWe cannot and will not allow the proliferation of these demeaning and degrading images, which are disproportionately aimed at women and girls.\"",
      "Ofcom said Monday it has made \u201curgent contact\u201d with X.",
      "\u201cWe are aware of serious concerns raised about a feature on Grok on X that produces undressed images of people and sexualised images of children,\u201d the watchdog said.",
      "The watchdog said it contacted both X and xAI to understand what steps it has taken to comply with British regulations.",
      "Under the U.K.\u2019s Online Safety Act, social media platforms must prevent and remove child sexual abuse material when they become aware of it.",
      "A Polish lawmaker used Grok on Tuesday as a reason for national digital safety legislation that would beef up protections for minors and make it easier for authorities to remove content.",

      "\u201cGrok lately is stripping people. It is undressing women, men and children. We feel bad about it. I would, honestly, almost want this Grok to also undress me,\u201d he said.",
      "The bloc's executive arm is \u201cwell aware\u201d that Grok is being used to for \u201cexplicit sexual content with some output generated with child-like images,\u201d European Commission spokesman Thomas Regnier said",
      "\u201cThis is not spicy. This is illegal. This is appalling. This is disgusting. This is how we see it, and this has no place in Europe. This is not the first time that Grok is generating such output,\" he told reporters Monday.",

      "The Paris prosecutor's office said it's widening an ongoing investigation of X to include sexually explicit deepfakes after officials received complaints from lawmakers.",
      "Three government ministers alerted prosecutors to \u201cmanifestly illegal content\" generated by Grok and posted on X, according to a government statement last week.",
      "The government also flagged problems with country's communications regulator over possible breaches of the EU's Digital Services Act.",
      "\u201cThe internet is neither a lawless zone nor a zone of impunity: sexual offenses committed online constitute criminal offenses in their own right and fall fully under the law, just as those committed offline,\u201d the government said.",
      "The Indian government on Friday issued an ultimatum to X, demanding that it take down all \u201cunlawful content\" and take action against offending users. The country's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology also ordered the company to review Grok's \"technical and governance framework\" and file a report on actions taken.",
      "The ministry accused Grok of \u201cgross misuse\u201d of AI and serious failures of its safeguards and enforcement by allowing the generation and sharing of \u201dobscene images or videos of women in derogatory or vulgar manner in order to indecently denigrate them.\"",
      "The ministry warned failure to comply by the 72-hour deadline would expose the company to bigger legal problems, but the deadline passed with no public update from India.",
      "The Malaysian communications watchdog said Saturday it was investigating X users who violated laws prohibiting spreading \u201cgrossly offensive, obscene or indecent content.\u201d",
      "The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission said it's also investigating online harms on X, and would summon a company representative.",
      "The watchdog said it took note of public complaints about X's AI tools being used to digitally manipulate \u201cimages of women and minors to produce indecent, grossly offensive, or otherwise harmful content.\u201d",
      "Lawmaker Erika Hilton said she reported Grok and X to the Brazilian federal public prosecutor\u2019s office and the country's data protection watchdog.",
      "In a social media post, she accused both of of generating, then publishing sexualized images of women and children without consent.",
      "She said X's AI functions should be disabled until an investigation has been carried out.",
      "Hilton, one of Brazil's first transgender lawmakers, decried how users could get Grok to digitally alter any published photo, including \u201cswapping the clothes of women and girls for bikinis or making them suggestive and erotic.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe right to one\u2019s image is individual; it cannot be transferred through the \u2018terms of use\u2019 of a social network, and the mass distribution of child porn(asterisk)gr(asterisk)phy by an artificial intelligence integrated into a social network crosses all boundaries,\" she said.",

      "A golden phone that President Donald Trump's family business promised to release last year remains mysteriously under wraps as the technology industry serves up a glut of new gadgets at CES in Las Vegas this week.",
      "When the Trump Organization launched a mobile phone service last June, it was supposed to be a stage setter for a new smartphone bathed in gold with a $500 price tag \u2014 a bargain compared to Apple's latest iPhone models that sell for anywhere from $800 to $1,200. The newly formed Trump Mobile targeted its T1 phone for an August or September release.",
      "What's more, Trump Mobile initially hailed T1 as a device that would be \u201cproudly designed and built in the United States for customers who expect the best.\"",
      "But both the T1's shipping date and U.S. manufacturing ambitions gradually began to shift, even as Trump Mobile continues to accept $100 deposits for the device.",
      "Not long after announcing the device, Trump Mobile pivoted from describing it as phone that would be made in the U.S. to framing it as a device that would be \u201cproudly American.\u201d Trump Mobile's website now touts the T1 as having an \u201cAmerican-proud\u201d design, with no further explanation.",
      "Analysts believed that the shift stemmed from a recognition that the U.S. lacked the supply chain and other logistics required to make a smartphone for less than $1,000 \u2014 the same hurdles that made it implausible for Apple to acquiesce to President Trump's demands that the company move its iPhone manufacturing from China and India.",
      "Later in the summer, Trump Mobile also became more vague about when the T1 would become available, but still indicated it would be delivered to customers who paid the $100 deposit by the end of 2025. Trump Mobile's website continues to list the T1's targeted release date as \u201clater this year.\u201d",

The Financial Times recently reported that it was told by a customer service representative for Trump Mobile that the phone will be shipped in late January and attributed its delayed release to the 43-day shutdown of the federal government last year.",
      "Whatever the reason, the T1's ongoing absence from the smartphone market didn't come as a surprise to International Data Corp. analyst Francisco Jeronimo.",
      "\u201cWe have always been quite skeptical about this phone,\u201d Jeronimo said. \u201cThey are probably finding that it is harder to build a phone than they thought it would be. Let's see if this thing comes to life or not.\u201d",
      "While the T1 has remained in a holding pattern, Trump Mobile has been selling its wireless service for $47.45 per month \u2014 a price tied to Donald Trump's titles as the 47th and 45th President. For customers looking for a smartphone that they can use sooner rather than later, Trump Mobile is also selling refurbished versions of older iPhones and Samsung's Galaxy models at prices ranging from $370 to $630.",
      "\u201cMaybe they changed their strategy and figured out they are better off just selling refurbished phones,\u201d Jeronimo said.",

      "Of the 50 homes, 63% have lead levels above the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s standard, according to the report. The average lead levels were almost 60 times higher than the EPA's rule.",
      "Even after fires were extinguished, volatile organic compounds from smoke, some known to cause cancer, lingered inside of people's homes, according to a recent study. To mitigate these risks, residents returning home should ventilate and filter indoor air by opening windows or running high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) purifiers with charcoal filters.",
      "Zoe Gonzalez Izquierdo said she can\u2019t get her insurance company to pay for an adequate cleanup of her family's Altadena home, which tested positive for dangerous levels of lead and other toxic compounds.",
      "\u201cThey can\u2019t just send a company that\u2019s not certified to just wipe things down so that then we can go back to a still contaminated home,\u201d Gonzalez said, who has children ages 2 and 4.",
      "Experts believe the lead, which can linger in dust on floors and windowsills, comes from burned lead paint. The University of Southern California reported that more than 70% of homes within the Eaton Fire were built before 1979, when lead paint was common.",
      "\u201cFor individuals that are pregnant, for young children, it\u2019s particularly important that we do everything we can to eliminate exposure to lead,\u201d said pediatrician Dr. Lisa Patel, executive director for the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health and a member of the climate group Science Moms.",
      "The same goes for asbestos, she added, because there is no safe level of exposure.",

      "Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Daniel Walker Howe has died at 88",
      "NEW YORK -- Daniel Walker Howe, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian whose \u201cWhat Hath God Wrought\u201d became a widely acclaimed chronicle of the vast technological and social changes in the U.S. in the first half of the 19th century, has died at age 88.",
      "Walker died on Dec. 25, according to a spokesman for the University of California, Los Angeles, where he was a professor emeritus. Additional details were not immediately available.",
      "Awarded the Pulitzer in 2008, \u201cWhat Hath God Wrought\u201d was part of the Oxford University Press' ambitious and decades-long series on American history, with other works including such Pulitzer winners as David M.

Howe traced the steady expansion west of a young country abiding by the doctrine of \u201cManifest Destiny.\u201d He documented the rise of Andrew Jackson and modern political parties, the overturning of the elite order that had controlled the presidency since George Washington, and the ongoing debate over slavery that would lead to armed conflict.",
      "The country was facing changes familiar to 21st century Americans. In the years leading up to the Civil War, the U.S. became more industrialized, more entwined and more divided. Information was traveling faster; the title \u201cWhat Hath God Wrought\u201d was taken from the biblical phrase used for the first telegraph message, sent in 1844. Newspapers and books were proliferating thanks to cheaper printing and to more efficient mail service, and the infrastructure was being modernized through roads, bridges, canals and other public works projects.",
      "At the same time, the more technology advanced, the more resistance arose in the South, where leading politicians opposed the new projects \u2014 \"internal improvements\u201d \u2014 for fear they would undermine slavery.",
      "\u201cInternal improvements could be opposed for reasons that had nothing to do with their economic effects. There were those who felt their stake in the status quo threatened by any innovation, especially intervention sponsored by the federal government,\u201d Howe wrote.",
      "Reviewing the book for The New Yorker in 2007, historian Jill Lepore praised it as \u201ca heroic attempt at synthesizing a century and a half of historical writing.\u201d She also noted that \u201cWhat God Hath Wrought\u201d was not the first choice for Oxford editor C. Vann Woodward, the prize-winning Southern historian.",
      "\u201cWhat God Hath Wrought\u201d was, in part, a response to another acclaimed work: Charles Sellers\u2019 landmark \u201cThe Market Revolution: Jacksonian America, 1815-1846.\u201d Woodward had asked Sellers to contribute to the Oxford series but turned down \u201cThe Market Revolution\u201d because he found it too negative. Released by Oxford as a separate volume in 1991, Sellers\u2019 book contended that advances in technology uprooted rural communities and livelihoods and portrayed Jackson as an opposing force who stood \u2014 in vain \u2014 for working people against the industrial powers.",

He found that innovation served less as a destroyer of old ties than as a force for democracy. He dedicated \u201cWhat God Hath Wrought\u201d to the patrician John Quincy Adams, Jackson\u2019s bitter rival in presidential elections and his opposite in personal background.",
      "\u201cBefore I wrote this book I had never really grasped how often improvements in material terms fostered improvements in moral terms,\" Howe told the National Review in 2007. \u201cThe people who encouraged economic diversification and development in many cases also supported more humane laws, wider access to education, a halt to the expansion of slavery, even, sometimes, greater equality for women.\u201d",
      "Howe's other books included \u201cThe Unitarian Conscience: Harvard Moral Philosophy 1805-1861,\u201d \u201cThe Political Culture of the American Whigs\u201d and \u201cMaking the American Self: Jonathan Edwards to Abraham Lincoln.\u201d He taught at several schools, starting with Yale University in 1966 and continuing at UCLA from 1973-93 and Oxford University from 1993-2002.

He majored in history and literature at Harvard University and received his doctorate in history from Berkeley in 1966.",
      "Howe has said that being asked to write \u201cWhat Hath God Wrought\u201d appealed to him for the chance to write for general readers, and not just historians. His intention was to craft an old-fashioned narrative while drawing upon more recent scholarship on social movements, presenting the country's history as an ongoing debate over whether success was defined by military and economic power or by moral achievements.",
      "\u201cIn 1848, it seemed that the greatness of the American people had been shown in their extensive recent conquest across the continent. Later, that greatness could seem affirmed by the preservation of the Union, industrial might, commercial influence, scientific research, and victories over global enemies,\u201d he wrote.",
      "\u201cLater still, perhaps that greatness might be seen in the extent to which the dreams of the 1848 feminists and abolitionists have at length been realized. History works on a long time scale, and at any given moment we can perceive directions but imperfectly.\u201d",

      "\u201cI went to Thailand, man!\u201d Smith recalled with a grin, describing the first time he strapped on a VR device and was transported to the lush landscapes and bustling markets of Southeast Asia.",
      "A Los Angeles-based nonprofit is bringing the technology to California prisons with the goal of providing inmates a brief escape and, more importantly, exposure to real world scenarios that will prepare them to reenter society.",
      "During a weeklong program last month, incarcerated men at Valley State Prison near Fresno sat on metal folding chairs in a common area. They shuffled in their seats as they were outfitted with the headsets that resemble opaque goggles. Their necks contorted slightly and smiles spread across their faces as the high-definition videos started and their journeys commenced.",
      "Some saw the sights on the other side of the globe, including Bangkok, while others experienced more practical scenes, such as job interviews. The men sit across virtual desks from virtual interviewers who are both easygoing and hard-nosed to give them the tools for finding employment once they're released.",
      "\u201cFor a lot of us, the workforce has changed and things are different with the application process,\u201d said Smith, who is eligible for parole in 2031 and now volunteers helping his fellow inmates navigate the VR experience. \u201cIt\u2019s a nerve wracking experience going to sit in front of somebody and telling them why I\u2019m good for the job.\u201d",
      "Afterward, volunteers help the inmates process the emotions or traumas that bubbled up during their experiences. Sabra Williams, founder of the nonprofit Creative Acts, calls the VR devices a \u201chope machine.\u201d",
      "The program stems from a prison arts project that Williams ran that incorporated theater, music, poetry, dance and painting. Watching incarcerated people become engaged in artistic pursuits made her wonder about other ways to \u201cbring the outside world inside.\"",
      "She heard from people who had left prison lamenting that technology had passed them by. They felt confounded by simple things like pumping gas, checking out at a supermarket, or going to the ATM.",
      "\u201cAnd what I hear from them is that it made them feel like they didn\u2019t belong, and that they only belong in prison,\u201d she said.",

Soon they were creating their own videos focusing on travel, constructive scenarios, civic engagement, conflict resolution, art, and even meditation \u201cto blow their minds and also educate their minds.\u201d",
      "Such technology could have an important role to play in rehabilitation and, especially, reintegration into society, said Nancy La Vigne, the dean of Rutgers-Newark School of Criminal Justice in New Jersey. She envisions people who haven't been in the real world for a long time using VR to act out navigating the DMV or figuring out how to take a city bus.",

      "\u201cYou can't just hand them out or sell them at commissary,\u201d La Vigne said.",
      "A former inmate, Richard Richard, first used a VR headset about six years ago when the program was launched and since his release has become a volunteer for Creative Acts. He said he's impressed by how far the technology has advanced. He loves watching his fellow inmates use the devices for the first time and then progress as they deal with trauma and emotional issues.",
      "\u201cYou may physically be here, but mentally, spiritually you can actually transcend this environment,\u201d he said.",
      "The group conducts the program, using 100 Oculus headsets donated by Meta, both in general population and in solitary confinement. Youth offenders are also eligible. It currently runs three times a year at four California prisons, and Williams hopes to expand it throughout the state and across the country.",
      "The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation didn't immediately respond this week to inquiries about plans to expand the program. But in announcing the introduction of VR at the California Men's Colony prison in San Luis Obispo County last August, the department said the usage has the potential \u201cto heal trauma, regulate emotional response, and prepare for a safe, successful reentry into society.\u201d",

      "The U.S. already has access to Greenland under a 1951 defense agreement, and Denmark and Greenland would be \u201cquite happy\u201d to accommodate a beefed up American military presence, Mortensgaard said.",

      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told a select group of U.S. lawmakers this week that it was the Republican administration\u2019s intention to eventually purchase Greenland, as opposed to using military force. Danish and Greenlandic officials have previously said the island isn't for sale.",
      "It's not clear how much buying the island could cost, or if the U.S. would be buying it from Denmark or Greenland.",
      "Washington also could boost its military presence in Greenland \u201cthrough cooperation and diplomacy,\u201d without taking it over, Bayoumi said.",
      "One option could be for the U.S. to get a veto over security decisions made by the Greenlandic government, as it has in islands in the Pacific Ocean, Gad said.",
      "Palau, Micronesia and the Marshall Islands have a Compact of Free Association, or COFA, with the U.S.",
      "That would give Washington the right to operate military bases and make decisions about the islands\u2019 security in exchange for U.S. security guarantees and around $7 billion of yearly economic assistance, according to the Congressional Research Service.",
      "It's not clear how much that would improve upon Washington's current security strategy. The U.S. already operates the remote Pituffik Space Base in northwestern Greenland, and can bring as many troops as it wants under existing agreements.",
      "Greenlandic politician Aaja Chemnitz told The Associated Press that Greenlanders want more rights, including independence, but don't want to become part of the U.S.",
      "Gad suggested influence operations to persuade Greenlanders to join the U.S. would likely fail. He said that is because the community on the island is small and the language is \u201cinaccessible.\u201d",
      "Danish Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen summoned the top U.S. official in Denmark in August to complain that \u201cforeign actors\u201d were seeking to influence the country\u2019s future. Danish media reported that at least three people with connections to Trump carried out covert influence operations in Greenland.",
      "Even if the U.S. managed to take control of Greenland, it would likely come with a large bill, Gad said. That\u2019s because Greenlanders currently have Danish citizenship and access to the Danish welfare system, including free health care and schooling.",
      "To match that, \u201cTrump would have to build a welfare state for Greenlanders that he doesn\u2019t want for his own citizens,\u201d Gad said.",
      "Since 1945, the American military presence in Greenland has decreased from thousands of soldiers over 17 bases and installations to 200 at the remote Pituffik Space Base in the northwest of the island, Rasmussen said last year. The base supports missile warning, missile defense and space surveillance operations for the U.S. and NATO.",
      "U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance told Fox News on Thursday that Denmark has neglected its missile defense obligations in Greenland, but Mortensgaard said that it makes \u201clittle sense to criticize Denmark,\u201d because the main reason why the U.S. operates the Pituffik base in the north of the island is to provide early detection of missiles.",
      "The best outcome for Denmark would be to update the defense agreement, which allows the U.S. to have a military presence on the island and have Trump sign it with a \u201cgold-plated signature,\u201d Gad said.",
      "But he suggested that's unlikely because Greenland is \u201chandy\u201d to the U.S president.",
      "When Trump wants to change the news agenda \u2014 including distracting from domestic political problems \u2014 \u201che can just say the word \u2018Greenland' and this starts all over again,\" Gad said.",

      "Galant said he believes that\u2019s the goal of the Trump administration: \u201cto cause such an indiscriminate suffering in the civilian population as to instigate some sort of uprising, regime change.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis sort of besiegement of Cuba is very intentional. Will it work from their perspective? I think that the Cuban people have experienced suffering for a very long time, and the Cuban government is very well versed in how to handle these situations,\u201d Galant said. \u201cI think it\u2019s very difficult to predict what will and will not spark actual regime instability.

      "Although the Cuban economy never fully recovered after the fall of the Soviet Union in the 1990s, it experienced relative prosperity between 2000 and 2019, fueled by a boom in tourism and exports of services, nickel, rum and tobacco.",

      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- A man convicted of killing a traveling salesman during a robbery is set to become Florida's first execution of 2026 under a death warrant signed Friday by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who signed off on a record 19 executions last year.",
      "Ronald Palmer Heath, 64, is scheduled to die by lethal injection Feb. 10 at Florida State Prison. DeSantis oversaw more executions in a single year in 2025 than any other Florida governor since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. The previous record was set in 2014 with eight executions.",
      "Heath was convicted of first-degree murder, robbery with a death weapon and multiple forgery charges in 1990.",
      "According to court records, Heath and his brother, Kenneth Heath, met traveling salesman Michael Sheridan at a Gainesville bar in May 1989. After hanging out at the bar for some time, the three men agreed to go somewhere else to smoke marijuana.",
      "At some point, the brothers plotted to rob the other man, investigators said. Ronald Heath drove the group to a remote area, where Kenneth Heath pulled a handgun on Sheridan. The man initially refused to give the brothers anything, and Kenneth Heath shot Sheridan in the chest.",
      "As Sheridan emptied his pockets, Ronald Heath began kicking the man and stabbing him with a hunting knife, prosecutors said. Kenneth Heath then shot Sheridan twice in the head.",

      "Kenneth Heath was also charged with Sheridan's murder, but he was sentenced to life in prison as part of a plea agreement.",
      "Attorneys for Ronald Heath are expected to file appeals to the Florida Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "A total of 47 people were executed in the U.S. in 2025. Florida led the way with a flurry of death warrants signed by DeSantis. The state's final execution of 2025 was the Dec. 18 lethal injection of Frank Athen Walls, who was convicted of fatally shooting a man and his girlfriend during a home invasion robbery.",

      "VATICAN CITY -- VATICAN CITY (AP) \u2014 Pope Leo XIV said Thursday he intended to bring the world\u2019s Catholic cardinals together annually, indicating a new governing style for the church that involves consulting its top leaders regularly and as a group.",
      "At the end of his first consistory, as such meetings are called, Leo asked cardinals to return to Rome for a second session at the end of June and from then onward on an annual basis for three to four days each year, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said.",
      "Cardinals said the proposed date for the second session would be June 27-28, before a big June 29 feast day.",
      "Pope Francis had largely eschewed consistories and the College of Cardinals as a whole to help him govern. Instead, he had a hand-picked group of nine cardinals who met every few months at the Vatican to advise him.",
      "Before the May conclave that elected Leo, cardinals had complained about Francis\u2019 go-it-alone governing style and called for the new pope to convene regular consistories so the cardinals could gather as a group and advise the pope on pressing issues facing the church.",

      "Weir formed the Grateful Dead with Jerry Garcia after the two met in 1963 as teens in Palo Alto, California. The band, with its unique mix of blues, folk and jazz, became a touring powerhouse for decades until Garcia's death in 1995.",

      "The band would survive long past the hippie moment of its birth, with its ultra-devoted fans known as Deadheads often following them on the road in a virtually non-stop tour that persisted despite decades of music and culture shifting around them.",
      "\"Longevity was never a major concern of ours,\" Weir said when the Dead got the Grammys' Musicares Person of the Year honor last year. \"Spreading joy through the music was all we ever really had in mind and we got plenty of that done.\"",
      "Ubiquitous bumper stickers and T-shirts showed the band's skull logo, the dancing, colored bears that served as their other symbol, and signature phrases like \"ain't no time to hate\" and \"not all who wander are lost.\"",

      "\"This is among the Holy Grail of comic books. Without Superman and his popularity, there would be no Batman or other superhero comic book legends,\" Zurzolo said. \"Its importance in the comic book community shows with his deal, as it obliterates the previous record.\"",
      "The comic book was stolen from Cage's Los Angeles home in 2000, but was recovered in 2011 when it was found by a man who had purchased the contents of an old storage locker in Southern California. It eventually was returned to Cage, who had bought it in 1996 for $150,000. Six months after it was returned to him, he sold it at auction for $2.2 million.",
      "Stephen Fishler, CEO of Metropolis Collectibles/Comic Connect, said the theft eventually played a big role in boosting the comic's value.",
      "\"During that 11-year period (it was missing), it skyrocketed in value,\" Fishler said. \"The thief made Nicolas Cage a lot of money by stealing it.\"",
      "Fishler compared it to the theft of Mona Lisa, which was stolen from the Louvre museum in Paris in 1911.",
      "\"It was kept under the thief's bed for two years,\" Fishler noted. \"The recovery of the painting made the Mona Lisa go from being just a great Da Vinci painting to a world icon \u2014 and that's what Action No. 1 is \u2014 an icon of American pop culture.\"",

      "The attorney who was representing Nick Reiner, accused of killing his parents, filmmaker Rob Reiner and his wife, photographer Michele Singer Reiner, unexpectedly withdrew from the case during what was supposed to be Nick Reiner's arraignment Wednesday, but made a bold declaration afterward: \"Take this to the bank. Pursuant to the law in California, Nick Reiner is not guilty of murder. Print that! Print that!\"",
      "Nick Reiner, 32, is charged with two counts of first-degree murder with special circumstances, accused of\u00a0stabbing his parents to death\u00a0on Dec. 14 in their home in the upscale Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles. The L.A. County medical examiner\u00a0said\u00a0the Rob and Michele Reiner died from \"multiple sharp force injuries.\"",
      "Nick Reiner was supposed to enter a plea on Wednesday, but that arraignment was postponed when his defense attorney, Alan Jackson, told the court, \"We feel that we have no choice at this juncture, but to withdraw as counsel.\"",
      "The judge did not allow cameras to show Nick Reiner in court, but he stood shackled, head shaved and wearing a brown jumpsuit.",
      "Jackson, who famously won an acquittal in the murder trial of Karen Read and represented disgraced film mogul Harvey Weinstein, did not explain his decision to withdraw from the case. Outside the courthouse, he told CBS News it was one of the most painful decisions he's ever made as a lawyer.",
      "Jackson said he was forced to withdraw due to \"circumstances beyond our control, but more importantly, circumstances beyond Nick's control,\" which \"have dictated that, sadly, it's impossible for us to continue our representation.\" He added that he was \"legally and ethically prohibited from explaining the reasons why.\"",
      "The L.A. County Public Defender's Office will take over for Jackson and his co-counsel. Deputy Public Defender Kimberly Greene will represent Nick Reiner, who will remain in custody until the new hearing date. He is being held without bail and his arraignment has been rescheduled to Feb. 23.",
      "L.A. County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said after the hearing that he was \"fully confident\" Nick Reiner would be found guilty of the charges against him.",
      "If convicted, Nick Reiner could face a maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole, and the district attorney's office has indicated it may also seek the death penalty, but no final decision has yet been made.",

    "summary": "The funeral for Brigitte Bardot was private, but hundreds poured into the streets of Saint-Tropez to pay their respects to an icon of the 1960s silver screen.",
    "story": [
      "Paris \u2014 Brigitte Bardot's funeral was being held on Wednesday with a private service and a public homage in Saint-Tropez, the French Riviera resort where she lived for more than half a century after retiring from movie stardom at the height of her fame.",
      "The animal rights activist and far-right supporter died on Dec. 28 at the age of 91 at her home in southern France.",
      "President Emmanuel Macron said after her death that France was \"mourning a legend.\"",
      "She died from cancer after undergoing two operations, her husband, Bernard d'Ormale, said in an interview with Paris Match magazine released Tuesday evening. \"She was conscious and concerned about the fate of animals until the very end,\" he said.",
      "Residents and admirers applauded the funeral convoy as the coffin of Bardot, once one of the world's most photographed women and a defining screen siren of the 1960s, was being carried through the town's narrow streets.",
      "A service started to the sound of Maria Callas' \"Ave Maria\" at the Notre-Dame-de-l'Assomption Catholic Church in the presence of Bardot's husband, son and grandchildren, as well as guests invited by the family and the Brigitte Bardot Foundation for the protection of animals.",
      "Hundreds of people gathered in the small town to follow the farewell on large screens set up at the port and on two plazas.",
      "After the church service, Bardot is to be buried \"in the strictest privacy\" at a cemetery overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, according to the Saint-Tropez town hall.",
      "She had long called Saint-Tropez her refuge from the celebrity that once made her a household name.",
      "A public homage will take place at a nearby site for admirers of the woman whose image once symbolized France's postwar liberation and sensuality.",
      "\"Brigitte Bardot will forever be associated with Saint-Tropez, of which she was the most dazzling ambassador,\" the town hall said last week. \"Through her presence, personality and aura, she marked the history of our town.\"",
      "Bardot settled decades ago in her seaside villa, La Madrague, and retired from filmmaking in 1973 at age 39, during an international career that spanned more than two dozen films.",
      "She later emerged as an animal rights activist, founding and sustaining a foundation devoted to the protection of animals.",
      "\"Man is an insatiable predator,\" Bardot told The Associated Press on her 73rd birthday, in 2007. \"I don't care about my past glory. That means nothing in the face of an animal that suffers, since it has no power, no words to defend itself.\"",
      "Her activism earned her compatriots' respect and, in 1985, she was awarded the Legion of Honor, the nation's highest recognition.",
      "While she withdrew from the film industry, she remained a highly visible and often controversial public figure through decades of militant animal rights activism and links with far-right politics.",
      "She will be buried in the so-called marine cemetery, where her parents are also interred.",
      "The cemetery, overlooking the Mediterranean sea, is also the final resting place of several cultural figures, including filmmaker Roger Vadim, Bardot's first husband, who directed her breakout film \"And God Created Woman,\" a role that made her a worldwide star.",

      "She added picking the perfect jokes for the show is \"one of \u2026 the most difficult jobs I've ever done.\"",
      "Glaser said she is a big fan of the celebrities up for awards and said this year is a little different because she grew up admiring many of the actors.",
      "\"It is easy for me to take down like, you know, the newer batch of actresses and actors who are younger than me. It is like, OK I can make fun of you, I'm like a veteran. But when it's like people I grew up admiring it's \u2026 oh, my gosh, it is so much \u2026 it is a different approach this year.\"",
      "While preparing last year, Glaser reached out to some celebrities to see if a joke went too far. She said she hasn't done this yet so far and may have a different strategy.",
      "\"There are certain people that I don't know what I would say. It is almost like some of these jokes, you think about, OK, if I got their number, would I write them and ask them? Then I go, you know what? They might say no and I know the joke isn't that mean, and \u2026 I would rather ask for forgiveness later at the after-party when they're drunk,\" she said with a laugh.",
      "As Glaser rehearses, she's found one joke that doesn't always connect with the audience.",
      "\"I'm trying out my monologue around L.A. at the clubs here, and just even any joke about Julia Roberts, they're not there for. You cannot make fun of America's sweetheart,\" Glaser said. \"Whatever I end up saying about her, it is the most fine-tuned joke I have worked on so hard because it is very delicate.\"",

    "story": [
      "Countless young dancers have followed in the footsteps of Carmen de Lavallade, the Grande Dame of American dance who's among those receiving Kennedy Center honors in Washington tonight. She's been shattering barriers almost all her life, as Rita Braver now shows us:",
      "The elegant 86-year-old in pink putting young members of the Dance Theatre of Harlem through their paces (\"Lighten up!\") just happens to be one of the pioneers of American Modern Dance: Carmen de Lavallade.",
      "Braver asked, \"What was it always that you have hoped that audiences would get from seeing you dance over the years?\"",
      "\"The connection,\" she replied. \"Because I don't feel that I'm there just dancing for myself, you know? I'm dancing for the audience.\"",
      "The remarkable journey of this California bricklayer's daughter is being saluted this weekend with a Kennedy Center Honor.",
      "It's a story that begins when even getting dance lessons was a challenge, as she described in her 2014 one-woman show: \"In those days, there were very few people who would take you if you were colored,\" she recalled. \"And if you did get into a dance studio, the white students would walk out.\"",
      "But her talent triumphed. While still in high school, de Lavallade won a place in a prestigious L.A. dance company. And she didn't go alone. She was joined by a high school friend who turned out to be a pretty good dancer himself: Alvin Ailey.",
      "De Lavallade introduced Ailey to the world of dance, and they were partners for years.",
      "In 1954 they were invited to perform in \"House of Flowers,\" an all-black Broadway show. But it was a cast member from Trinidad who won her heart: Geoffrey Holder. They were married within three months.",
      "Braver asked, \"What was it about him that attracted you?\"",
      "\"I must say that he allowed me to be who I am. We didn't get in each other's way.\"",
      "Holder became a Tony Award-winning director (for \"The Wiz\") who often created both dances and costumes for his wife. The mementos of their life together are stored in a cavernous Harlem warehouse. \"I lived with this all my life,\" de Lavallade mused.",
      "Since Holder's death in 2014, de Lavallade  and her son, Leo, have been cataloging every piece -- letters, photos, costumes and clothes -- and recalling the stories that go with them, some of them bittersweet.",
      "In 1961 de Lavallade, by then an international sensation, was to appear on \"The Ed Sullivan Show.\"",
      "But she was not allowed to perform with the white dancer she was working with at the time.",
      "Braver asked, \"How did you feel when you were told that?\"",
      "\"You know, I wasn't surprised,\" she replied. \"It's not like today where, you know, you can get up and do all your protesting. It wasn't like that. You said, 'OK, move on.'\"",
      "And move on she did. She was one of the first black dancers at the Metropolitan Opera, where she also became a choreographer.\u00a0 And she joined the faculty of the Yale School of Drama, where she taught actors how to move.",
      "She is still performing. But she has never forgotten the lessons of history and the injustice she and other Black artists have faced",
      "And so, de Lavallade became one of the Kennedy Center Honorees who announced she would boycott the now-canceled White House reception after President Trump seemed to equate White nationalists who marched in Charlottesville with protesters who opposed them.",

    "published": "Fri, 09 Jan 2026 16:41:52 -0500",
    "summary": "After the ACA tax credit lapsed in December, enrollees are opting for less robust health plans or dropping coverage altogether.",
    "story": [
      "When Kassidy Hooter learned in December how much her health insurance costs were going to rise this year, she went into panic mode.",
      "The Shreveport, Louisiana, resident and mother of three knew she urgently needed care \u2014 Hooter is in the final trimester of a high-risk pregnancy. But the family could no longer afford their Affordable Care Act plan coverage now that a federal tax subsidy was lapsing on Dec. 31, 2025, meaning they would face thousands of dollars in additional out-of-pocket costs.",
      "\"We heavily considered that it might just be cheaper to give birth at home,\" Hooter, 24, told CBS News. \"Just because that's an insane amount of debt to take on.\"",
      "In the end, Hooter decided to forgo insurance altogether.",
      "A local medical center offered three months of financial aid that will carry her through her due date in February and into late March. After that, she will have to bear any medical expenses on her own. Her plan now is to get her newborn on Medicaid, a government health plan for low-income Americans, as quickly as possible.",
      "\"I'm just hoping for the best,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Health insurance as \"luxury\"",
      "Since its introduction in 2010, the ACA has been instrumental in cutting the share of uninsured Americans from approximately 15% to 8%, according to Nima Sheth, vice president of health justice at the National Partnership for Women and Families, a nonprofit advocacy group.",
      "However, the number of people without health insurance is likely to surge if Congress fails to come up with a solution for the 22 million Americans who received an ACA tax credit, experts warn. The number of uninsured will rise by an average of 3.8 million each year from 2026 to 2034 without an extension of the credits, the Congressional Budget Office estimated in 2024.",
      "Americans in most states have until Jan. 15 to enroll in an ACA marketplace plan, according to healthinsurance.org.",
      "Without the tax credits, premiums for ACA enrollees who previously relied on the subsidies will increase by an average of 114%, estimates\u00a0KFF, a nonprofit provider of health policy news and research.",
      "\"What we're seeing here is a policy choice \u2014 is, in effect, turning insurance into a luxury item and medical debt into the default,\" Michelle Sternthal, interim senior director of policy and strategy at health care advocacy group Community Catalyst, told CBS News.",
      "The House of Representatives on Thursday\u00a0approved a three-year extension\u00a0of the expired ACA tax credits. The legislation faces an uphill climb in the Republican-led Senate, although lawmakers think it could provide a starting point for a compromise that would keep the credits alive in some form.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me\"",
      "Plantation, Florida, resident Stacy Kanas, whose family also received an ACA tax credit, is now considering going without health insurance after realizing that her monthly premium to cover her and her husband would rise to $2,500 \u2014 more than double what she was paying last year to cover both of them plus her 20-year-old daughter.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me,\" Kanas, 59, told CBS News. \"My husband had a major surgery about five years ago, and we don't want to be uninsured.\"",
      "Although in decent health, the small business owner worries about what could happen if someone in her family falls seriously ill. \"You're one catastrophic event away from perhaps having a financial disaster,\" she said.",
      "Even people who keep their ACA coverage could end up skipping out on care to avoid out-of-pocket expenses, experts said.",
      "\"If you're underinsured and you have high deductibles, the coverage that you're getting is designed to dissuade getting care, including preventative care, so you're going to delay your care until there are emergencies,\" Sternthal said.",
      "Robert Myers, a consultant based outside of St. Louis, Missouri, was on a silver ACA plan last year, but switched to a bronze plan after learning his premiums would rise to $400 a month, up from $17 in 2025.",
      "Under his new plan, the 31-year-old does not have a monthly premium. However, Myers could owe much more in out-of-pocket costs due to $80 co-pays and an $8,000 deductible. As a result, he's planning on scaling back on doctor's visits, a trend experts say ends up driving more people to the emergency room for care.",
      "\"They'll kind of go to the ER and get what they need fixed with a band aid, and then not get long-term care,\" Sheth said.",
      "This can have wider ripple effects because an increase in uncompensated hospital care can drive up costs for other patients, as facilities seek to recoup the costs, according to Sternthal, who supports an\u00a0extension of the ACA tax credits.",
      "\"Every delay locks families into decisions that harm their health and their financial stability, but then also reverberates out into the business community, the local community,\" she said.",

      "Enough Shame and Blame",
      "My patient Alice began experiencing self-blame in childhood. Her well-intentioned mom put her on diets when she was in her early teens. Even before that, she had started to develop what she eventually called the \"self-hatred voice.\" She vividly remembers when she was ten years old, sitting in the front yard with her legs bent, seeing the inside curvature of her leg and wanting it to be smaller. \"This is the line where your muscle is, and on the inside is a curve. That's the fat and the extra skin. I thought, 'Oh, if I could just cut that off, then my leg would be perfect.' I had a pen, and I drew the line where I thought my legs should be and where the fat should be cut off. I just knew that I was larger than I wanted to be.\" Alice lived in Vermont at the time, and her mother had a garden where she grew all sorts of vegetables\u2014lettuce, carrots, cucumbers. \"I just remember eating salad, so much salad!\" Alice recalls. At thirteen, she sat at the table, thinking, \"Here's a plate with three pieces of lettuce and a carrot,\" and wondering how she was going to get through basketball practice or soccer without passing out or blowing the game for her teammates.",
      "A few years later, her mother put herself and Alice on a no-carb diet. \"Atkins was kinda big,\" Alice says. Her father and two younger brothers were exempt; it was only for the girls of the family. Which basically meant Alice and her mother were still eating everything from the garden, except no turnips, because turnips had \"too many carbs.\"",
      "After three days, Alice revolted. She reached for some crackers in the cupboard: \"Mom, I just ate an entire sleeve of saltines!\" Hearing this, her mother was not upset with her. Alice shared, \"She was desperate for carbs, too, and ate three saltines herself. And then dutifully returned to her no-carb diet.\"",
      "At sixteen, Alice started tracking her weight for sports. The self-hatred voice in her mind began to be very specific and explicit. \"The cupcake you just ate\u2014what is the number of calories in it? What is the number of carbs?\" She described that it wouldn't let up, not even for just one tiny-teeny bite. It was unrelenting.",
      "Fast-forward more than thirty years, and by the time Alice was nearly fifty, she had tried every diet and workout program under the sun: forty-seven of them, to be exact. Atkins, keto, South Beach, the Zone, low carb, no carb, ultra-low fat, liquid only, Jillian Michaels, Jane Fonda, Suzanne Somers, full-body HIIT workouts, gym memberships, a YMCA weight coach, DietBet, StepBet, a Mediterranean diet, a vegetarian diet, the raw food diet, intermittent fasting. She'd even tried hypnosis. She had three teenagers, a fulfilling job in communications, and a loving boyfriend. She struggled with obesity despite spending much of her adult life tracking every morsel of food, eating mostly healthful meals, and exercising every day. She had successfully lost weight countless times. That wasn't the issue. The problem was that she always gained it back. She always blamed herself for having obesity. She did not know about the biology of obesity, yet.",

      "Airlines are serving \"potentially unhealthy water\" to passengers, according to a new study, with researchers recommending that travelers stick to bottled water and avoid drinking coffee or tea served on aircraft.",
      "The nonprofit Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity, which examined more than 35,000 water samples served by 10 major and 11 regional airlines over three years, also urges passengers to avoid washing their hands in aircraft bathrooms and instead stick to using hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.",
      "Among major U.S. airlines, three \u2014 American Airlines, JetBlue and Spirit \u2014 earned a \"D\" rating from the group, according to the analysis. Delta and Frontier were the top-ranked major carriers, both earning \"A\" grades for their water.",
      "Water quality may not be a top-of-mind airline safety issue with passengers, but it's nevertheless an \"important public health consideration,\" the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity noted in its analysis. Drinking potentially contaminated aircraft water can result in issues such as gastrointestinal illness and exposure to pathogens, the group added.",
      "What the study found",
      "The analysis found that 2.7% of samples tested positive for total coliform, a group of bacteria that's found in the digestive tracts of humans and animals, as well as in plants and soil.",
      "\"Testing for coliform bacteria is important because their presence in drinking water indicates that disease-causing organisms (pathogens) could be in the water system,\" the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity said in its report.",
      "E. coli was identified 32 times across the 21 airlines, the group said.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency established the Aircraft Drinking Water Rule, or ADWR, in 2011, which applies to U.S. carriers with onboard drinking water systems for passengers and crew. The rule requires airlines to test for coliform bacteria and possible E. coli, as well as to disinfect and flush each aircraft's water tank four times a year.",
      "But the EPA rarely levies civil penalties to airlines that violate the ADWR, the study noted.",

      "American Airlines told CBS News it is \"closely reviewing\" the findings.",
      "\"American's potable water program is fully in compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Aircraft Drinking Water Rule (ADWR),\" the carrier told CBS News. \"A recent EPA audit showed there were no significant findings with our program, and we have not received any violations for any potable water cabinets or trucks that we use.\"",
      "JetBlue said in a statement that it follows processes outlined by the EPA, the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration to ensure safe water. The airline added that it serves bottled drinking water on its flights.",
      "Spirit also said it maintains a comprehensive testing and maintenance program that complies with the EPA's aircraft drinking water rule.",
      "\"The well-being and comfort of our guests is very important to us,\" the company told CBS News in a statement. \"Our data shows we have made progress in this area in recent years, and we continue to evaluate and refine our procedures as necessary.\"",
      "Southwest Airlines, which received a \"C\" grade, said it regularly inspects the water quality aboard its planes and that it complies with EPA standards. The company also said it only uses water from local municipal public water systems that already meet standards for residents and businesses.",
      "On its website, the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity describes its mission as \"creating a more equitable food system that will improve health outcomes.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump called for a one-year cap on credit card interest rates late Friday, an idea that has drawn strong support from lawmakers in both parties but pushback from card issuers.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is calling for a 10% cap on credit card interest rates for one year, an idea that has drawn strong support from lawmakers in both parties but pushback from card issuers.",
      "\"Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%, and even more, which festered unimpeded during the Sleepy Joe Biden Administration,\" the president wrote on Truth Social late Friday.",
      "Mr. Trump said the cap on interest rates should begin on Jan. 20, 2026, or the one-year anniversary of his second inauguration.",
      "Credit card interest rates currently average over 20%, according to Federal Reserve statistics, so a 10% cap would represent a significant cut in borrowing costs.",
      "It's unclear if the president will attempt to enforce his proposed 10% cap through some kind of executive action, or if his goal is to pressure credit card issuers to slash their rates voluntarily. CBS News has reached out to the White House and some of the largest credit card issuers in the U.S. for comment.",
      "Supporters point to trillions in credit card debt",
      "The idea of capping credit card interest rates has drawn bipartisan support. Last year, Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri and independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who caucuses with Democrats, teamed up to introduce legislation that would impose a 10% cap. A similar measure was also introduced in the House by Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida.",
      "Other recently proposed legislation would impose less stringent caps on fees and interest rates.",
      "Mr. Trump also called for temporarily capping interest rates at 10% on the campaign trail. Hours before the president's late Friday Truth Social post, Sanders criticized Mr. Trump on X\u00a0 for not following through on his pledge to limit interest rates.",
      "Supporters of the idea say it would aid scores of Americans who are languishing under mountains of credit card debt, and argue that credit card issuers can afford to cut their rates.",
      "Americans owed a total of $1.23 trillion in credit card balances in the third quarter of last year, the highest level on record, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. A 2024 study by NerdWallet found that the average U.S. household with credit card debt owed $10,563. Meanwhile, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found in 2023 that credit card rates have soared \"far above the cost of offering credit.\"",
      "\"We cannot continue to allow big banks to make huge profits ripping off the American people,\" Sanders said in a joint press release with Hawley last year.",
      "Said Luna: \"For too long, credit card companies have abused working class Americans with absurd interest rates, trapping them in an almost insurmountable amount of debt.\"",
      "Opponents argue a credit card rate cap could backfire",
      "Opponents of a cap, including banks and other credit card issuers, warn that limits on interest rates may force lenders to stop issuing credit cards to many riskier borrowers.",
      "A coalition of groups that represent banks \u2014 including the American Bankers Association and the Bank Policy Institute \u2014 argued in a statement to CBS News on Friday that a 10% interest rate cap \"would reduce credit availability and be devastating for millions of American families and small business owners who rely on and value their credit cards, the very consumers this proposal intends to help.\"",
      "The Bank Policy Institute estimated last year that more than 14 million American households that rarely pay their credit card balances in full could have their access to credit eliminated or curtailed by a 10% cap. Millions of people who sometimes pay off their balances could also face new restrictions, the group said.",
      "The American Bankers Association has\u00a0argued in the past that if credit card issuers end up needing to cut off access for \"all but the lowest-risk customers,\" many people who are in need of loans would be forced to shift to \"less regulated alternatives\" that often charge even higher rates, like payday lenders and pawn shops.",
      "Billionaire investor Bill Ackman, who backed Mr. Trump in his 2024 campaign, called the idea a \"mistake.\" He\u00a0wrote on X\u00a0that if card issuers are prevented from charging high enough interest rates to cover their losses and earn solid returns, \"credit card lenders will cancel cards for millions of consumers who will have to turn to loan sharks.\"",
      "Ackman later wrote: \"Finding a way to bring down credit card rates without taking credit away from many Americans would have a very positive impact on the most disadvantaged Americans.\"",
      "Scott Simpson, CEO of the trade group America's Credit Unions, told CBS News in a statement: \"While we appreciate the President's desire to increase affordability, the plain truth is that capping rates at 10% does not make credit more affordable, it makes it unattainable for millions of working Americans because financial institutions will not be able to offer credit cards to most consumers at a 10% rate.\"",
      "The Electronic Payments Coalition \u2014 which represents credit card issuers and payment networks \u2014 said \"a one-size-fits-all 10% cap risks making things worse by reducing access to credit and limiting choice.\"",
      "Trump pledges to deal with affordability",
      "The push to cap credit card interest rates is the latest proposal by Mr. Trump to cut borrowing costs, as he grapples with widespread concerns about affordability.",
      "Earlier this week, Mr. Trump directed the federal government to buy $200 million in mortgage bonds using cash from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in an effort to drive down mortgage rates.",
      "The president has also urged the Federal Reserve to more aggressively cut its benchmark interest rate, which influences borrowing costs for everything from mortgages and car loans to commercial loans \u2014 though rate cuts by the Fed could run the risk of causing inflation to surge.",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to nominate a new Federal Reserve chair in the coming weeks, and told reporters last month he's \"looking for somebody that will be honest with interest rates.\"",

      "President Trump disclosed U.S. jobs data the day before the Department of Labor released\u00a0hiring numbers for December, a closely watched economic report on Wall Street that can sway financial markets.",
      "At 8:20 p.m. EST on Thursday, Mr. Trump\u00a0posted a graph depicting changes in private and government employment since January 2025. When the full jobs report was released Friday morning, it became clear that Mr. Trump's post had incorporated the December employment data because the totals in the chart matched figures released in the monthly report.",
      "Mr. Trump brushed off the incident. \"I don't know if they posted them,\" he told reporters Friday afternoon. \"They gave me some numbers. When people give me things, I post them.\"",

      "Cooler hiring",
      "The government's latest jobs report shows that hiring cooled in December, with employers adding 50,000 jobs, while the nation's unemployment rate ticked down to 4.4%. The economy added roughly 584,000 jobs for all of 2025, down from more than 2 million in 2024, labor data shows.",
      "Federal economic data is held under strict embargo until its scheduled release because the information has the potential to move financial markets. Providing some investors with access to such data could allow them to place trades based on knowledge unavailable to other investors.",
      "White House economic officials are provided with an advance copy of the Labor Department's employment report each month on Thursday afternoon and sign agreements to keep the numbers confidential, though they also write up a summary for the president, according to the Associated Press.",

      "\"Markets don't react kindly to that, because obviously it means that perhaps a select few may have been able to front-run on that news ahead of the market at large,\" he said.",
      "Erica Groshen, a former commissioner at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unit that compiles the monthly employment figures, said that premature disclosures of the agency's data can be punished by fines and even jail time. But previous breaches typically have been met with a slap on the wrist, she noted.",

    "summary": "President Trump has said Venezuela \"unilaterally seized and sold American oil.\" But the history between the countries is far more complicated, experts note.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump announced the capture of former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife on Saturday, he justified the military operation in part by framing it as a move to recover assets that he claims had been stolen from U.S. companies.",
      "\"Venezuela unilaterally seized and sold American oil, American assets and American platforms, costing us billions and billions of dollars,\" Mr. Trump said. \"This constituted one of the largest thefts of American property in the history of our country.\"",
      "Who owns Venezuela's oil?",
      "The president's focus on Venezuela's oil is now raising questions about American energy companies' activities in the country, as well as whether U.S. oil giants might now work to revive its floundering petroleum industry. Venezuela's\u00a0constitution\u00a0states that the nation owns all mineral and hydrocarbon deposits \u2014 its oil and natural gas reserves \u2014 within its own territory, including those that lie beneath the country's seabed.",
      "Mr. Trump \"talks about them taking our oil \u2014 the oil itself was never 'our oil',\" Samantha Gross, director of the energy security and climate initiative at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, told CBS News, adding that the nation's vast crude reserves \"belong to the government of Venezuela.\"",
      "What's also true, however, is that U.S. oil companies had contractual agreements with Venezuela to extract, process and transport its oil, as well as to share in the revenue from oil sales.",
      "Mr. Trump's claims of theft reflect actions by then-Venezuela leader Hugo Ch\u00e1vez to nationalize the nation's energy sector in 2007 and to confiscate the production assets of Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips after they left the country, Gross said.",
      "Those seizures have led to years of lawsuits and efforts by the companies to recoup their losses. While a World Bank arbitration panel has ruled in favor of the oil companies, the money has yet to be recovered.",
      "\"It is beyond question that there are a number of U.S. companies and others out there who have claims against Venezuela that have been trying to get those claims satisfied for many years,\" Ted Posner, a partner at law firm Baker Botts and a former assistant general counsel for international affairs at the U.S. Department of the Treasury, told CBS News.",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Oil industry executives met on Friday afternoon at the White House with Mr. Trump, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright to discuss Venezuela. Representatives from Exxon, Chevron and ConocoPhillips attended, including ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance.",
      "\"ConocoPhillips continues to monitor developments in Venezuela and their potential implications for global energy supply and stability,\" the company said in a statement prior to the meeting.",
      "Said a Chevron spokesperson after the meeting on Friday: \"For more than a century, Chevron has been a part of Venezuela's past. We remain committed to its present. And we stand ready to help it build a better future while strengthening U.S. energy and regional security.\"",
      "Exxon didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "Ch\u00e1vez's power play \u2014 and corruption",
      "Venezuela's government has a long history of nationalizing its oil sector, with state oil company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela S.A., or PDVSA, taking over the industry in the 1970s. Exxon and other foreign oil companies continued to operate in the country by signing contracts to provide technical assistance and other expertise to PDVSA.",
      "In the 1990s, Exxon and other large petroleum companies were invited by then-Venezuelan President Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez to return in an effort to develop the oil reserves in the Orinoco River Basin, according to \"Energy in the Americas,\" a book published by the University of Calgary Press.",
      "But in 2003, Ch\u00e1vez fired thousands of PDVSA workers after they went on strike. Four years later, he expanded the nationalization push by requiring foreign companies to give majority ownership of their ventures to PDVSA. Exxon and ConocoPhillips failed to strike a deal with Venezuela, while BP, Houston-based Chevron, Norway's Statoil and France's Total signed pacts giving majority stakes to PDVSA, allowing them to remain, Reuters reported in 2007.",
      "\"Some agreed, and some did not, and assets were expropriated,\" Gross said.",
      "Amid widespread corruption under Ch\u00e1vez, as journalist Anne Appelbaum noted in a 2024 book, hundreds of billions of dollars were siphoned off from PDVSA and other Venezuelan companies and subsequently disappeared into private bank accounts around the world.",
      "A 2017 investigation by U.S. and Portuguese authorities found that PDVSA executives had funneled millions of dollars into Portugal's Banco Espirito Santo.",
      "Venezuela owes billions to Big Oil",
      "Ch\u00e1vez's strong-arm tactics led to efforts by Exxon and ConocoPhillips to seek compensation for their assets, with Exxon claiming it had lost $16.6 billion due to the nationalization campaign. A World Bank arbitration panel in 2014 awarded the company one-tenth of what it had sought, but that same body later\u00a0annulled most of that award.",
      "In a separate case, an international tribunal\u00a0ruled that Venezuela owed $8.7 billion to ConocoPhillips in compensation for the 2007 seizure of its assets.",
      "Other industries also had their assets taken away under Ch\u00e1vez's 14-year reign, and companies have filed at least 60 arbitration claims against Venezuela since the 2000s, according to Luisa Palacios, an adjunct senior research scholar at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy.",
      "\"The value of these liabilities is estimated at $20 to $30 billion or about 10% to 15% of the almost $200 billion in international debt obligations Venezuela owes,\" she said in an article this week published by Columbia.",
      "\"Venezuela could pay off these claims by inviting investors back to the country,\" she noted. \"That could be done through debt-for-equity swaps or by linking future oil production to repayment of current debts. However, restructuring the country's foreign obligations will likely be needed for Venezuela to fully realize its oil potential.\"",
      "U.S. wasting no time",
      "Venezuela's oil reserves\u00a0are estimated to be the world's largest, with more than 303 billion barrels. That represents about 17% of the world's total oil supply, according to OPEC\u00a0data.",
      "But Venezuela's crude oil production has plunged, with the industry today pumping 800,000 to 1 million barrels per day, down from more than 3 million per day in the early 2000s. That output has nosedived due to chronic underinvestment, government mismanagement, and the impact of U.S. and international sanctions.",
      "On Wednesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the U.S. will export between 30 million and 50 million barrels of oil from Venezuela, which will be sold at \"market rates,\" with revenue used \"in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Venezuela's interim government had agreed to release the oil.",
      "Although Mr. Trump is pushing U.S. oil companies to invest in Venezuela following Maduro's capture, they may need assurances before committing to new ventures, Gross said.",
      "\"The political situation in Venezuela is really uncertain right now. Before a company is going to realistically invest a lot of money, they will want a stable political situation,\" she added.",

      "What to know about Trump's meeting with oil executives:",
      "President Trump urged major energy companies to commit to building out Venezuela's oil infrastructure on Friday, convening a meeting at the White House to call on executives to pour billions of dollars into tapping the country's vast oil reserves.Representatives from Chevron, ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips and more than a dozen other oil and gas firms were on hand for the meeting in the White House East Room, less than a week after the U.S. captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in a daring raid in Caracas.\u00a0The president has laid out a strategy to sell millions of barrels of sanctioned Venezuelan oil and control the proceeds while building out additional production capacity.

      "Take Pittsburgh. With a population of roughly 308,000, the former steel hub offers the most per capita job openings of any metro area in the country, according to a recent\u00a0study from WalletHub that compared the employment landscape in 182 U.S. metros.",

    "summary": "After the ACA tax credit lapsed in December, enrollees are opting for less robust health plans or dropping coverage altogether.",
    "story": [
      "When Kassidy Hooter learned in December how much her health insurance costs were going to rise this year, she went into panic mode.",
      "The Shreveport, Louisiana, resident and mother of three knew she urgently needed care \u2014 Hooter is in the final trimester of a high-risk pregnancy. But the family could no longer afford their Affordable Care Act plan coverage now that a federal tax subsidy was lapsing on Dec. 31, 2025, meaning they would face thousands of dollars in additional out-of-pocket costs.",
      "\"We heavily considered that it might just be cheaper to give birth at home,\" Hooter, 24, told CBS News. \"Just because that's an insane amount of debt to take on.\"",
      "In the end, Hooter decided to forgo insurance altogether.",
      "A local medical center offered three months of financial aid that will carry her through her due date in February and into late March. After that, she will have to bear any medical expenses on her own. Her plan now is to get her newborn on Medicaid, a government health plan for low-income Americans, as quickly as possible.",
      "\"I'm just hoping for the best,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Health insurance as \"luxury\"",
      "Since its introduction in 2010, the ACA has been instrumental in cutting the share of uninsured Americans from approximately 15% to 8%, according to Nima Sheth, vice president of health justice at the National Partnership for Women and Families, a nonprofit advocacy group.",
      "However, the number of people without health insurance is likely to surge if Congress fails to come up with a solution for the 22 million Americans who received an ACA tax credit, experts warn. The number of uninsured will rise by an average of 3.8 million each year from 2026 to 2034 without an extension of the credits, the Congressional Budget Office estimated in 2024.",
      "Americans in most states have until Jan. 15 to enroll in an ACA marketplace plan, according to healthinsurance.org.",
      "Without the tax credits, premiums for ACA enrollees who previously relied on the subsidies will increase by an average of 114%, estimates\u00a0KFF, a nonprofit provider of health policy news and research.",
      "\"What we're seeing here is a policy choice \u2014 is, in effect, turning insurance into a luxury item and medical debt into the default,\" Michelle Sternthal, interim senior director of policy and strategy at health care advocacy group Community Catalyst, told CBS News.",
      "The House of Representatives on Thursday\u00a0approved a three-year extension\u00a0of the expired ACA tax credits. The legislation faces an uphill climb in the Republican-led Senate, although lawmakers think it could provide a starting point for a compromise that would keep the credits alive in some form.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me\"",
      "Plantation, Florida, resident Stacy Kanas, whose family also received an ACA tax credit, is now considering going without health insurance after realizing that her monthly premium to cover her and her husband would rise to $2,500 \u2014 more than double what she was paying last year to cover both of them plus her 20-year-old daughter.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me,\" Kanas, 59, told CBS News. \"My husband had a major surgery about five years ago, and we don't want to be uninsured.\"",
      "Although in decent health, the small business owner worries about what could happen if someone in her family falls seriously ill. \"You're one catastrophic event away from perhaps having a financial disaster,\" she said.",
      "Even people who keep their ACA coverage could end up skipping out on care to avoid out-of-pocket expenses, experts said.",
      "\"If you're underinsured and you have high deductibles, the coverage that you're getting is designed to dissuade getting care, including preventative care, so you're going to delay your care until there are emergencies,\" Sternthal said.",
      "Robert Myers, a consultant based outside of St. Louis, Missouri, was on a silver ACA plan last year, but switched to a bronze plan after learning his premiums would rise to $400 a month, up from $17 in 2025.",
      "Under his new plan, the 31-year-old does not have a monthly premium. However, Myers could owe much more in out-of-pocket costs due to $80 co-pays and an $8,000 deductible. As a result, he's planning on scaling back on doctor's visits, a trend experts say ends up driving more people to the emergency room for care.",
      "\"They'll kind of go to the ER and get what they need fixed with a band aid, and then not get long-term care,\" Sheth said.",
      "This can have wider ripple effects because an increase in uncompensated hospital care can drive up costs for other patients, as facilities seek to recoup the costs, according to Sternthal, who supports an\u00a0extension of the ACA tax credits.",
      "\"Every delay locks families into decisions that harm their health and their financial stability, but then also reverberates out into the business community, the local community,\" she said.",

      "The Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta said in a statement on Friday that the three deals will support up to 6.6 gigawatts of new and existing clean energy by 2035. A single gigawatt, according to a general industry standard for utilities, can power about 750,000 homes.",
      "\"These projects add reliable and firm power to the grid, reinforce America's nuclear supply chain, and support new and existing jobs to build and operate American power plants,\" the company said.",
      "Meta said its agreement with TerraPower will provide funding that supports the development of two new Natrium units capable of generating up to 690 megawatts of firm power with delivery as early as 2032. The deal also provides Meta with rights for energy from up to six other Natrium units capable of producing 2.1 gigawatts and targeted for delivery by 2035.",

      "The numbers",
      "The monthly job gains were below the 55,000 forecast by economists, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "The unemployment rate stood at 4.4% in December, compared with 4.5% in November, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday.",
      "Payroll gains were revised downward for both October and November, a sign that hiring was weaker than previously reported in those months. The U.S. labor market lost 173,000 jobs in October, a larger decline than the earlier reported decline of 105,000 jobs, while November hiring was revised down to 56,000 from 64,000.",
      "\"The labor market has shown continued resiliency, but it's still softening, and the pace of year-to-date overall employment gains has slowed to the dragging pace of growth we saw in 2020,\" said Jerry Tempelman, vice president of fixed income research at Mutual of America Capital Management, in a Friday email.",
      "In December, hiring was robust in food services and drinking, health care and social assistance, while the retail sector shed jobs, the BLS said.",
      "Most layoffs since 2020",
      "Employers announced 1.2 million job cuts in 2025, a 58% increase from the prior year and the highest level since 2020, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said Thursday.",
      "Job growth slowed throughout 2025 as some businesses grappled with economic uncertainty, prompting them to pull back on hiring. Employers added a total of roughly 584,000 jobs in 2025, down sharply from more than 2 million the previous year and the weakest annual gain outside a recession since 2003, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "Some big corporations, such as Amazon, cut jobs as they sought to rely more on artificial intelligence, while the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency oversaw the reduction of roughly 300,000 government jobs last year, Challenger, Gray & Christmas said.",
      "The headwinds facing the labor market prompted the Federal Reserve to thrice cut its benchmark interest rate late last year, as lowering borrowing costs can help spur hiring by making it cheaper for businesses to expand.",
      "Prior to the release of Friday's report, EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said he is forecasting hiring will average 25,000 new jobs per month for the first half of 2026, while the unemployment rate could drift up to 4.8%.",
      "What it means",
      "While hiring was weak in 2025, experts don't think the labor market is collapsing.",
      "\"There aren't any red flashing lights indicating an imminent recession, but there are plenty of yellow warning lights flashing, and there is the risk that we could approach stall speed,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, in a Friday research note.",
      "Payroll gains averaged about 50,000 per month last year, according to BLS\u00a0data, which is the amount the economy requires to maintain a stable labor market, according to Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group, which aligns with the December job gains and the average payroll gains throughout 2025.",
      "Interest rate outlook",
      "Signs of stabilization in the labor market \u2014 particularly a lower jobless rate \u2014 could lead the Federal Reserve to hit the brakes on interest rate cuts for now, according to some experts.",
      "\"For this report, all roads lead to the unemployment rate,\" said Olu Sonola, head of U.S. Economic Research at Fitch Ratings, in an email. \"At 4.4%, it simply reads as relief versus 4.6% and it should douse the Fed's recent urgency to backstop a weakening labor market.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve is tasked with maintaining strong hiring while also taming inflation. A weaker labor market picture in 2025 compelled the central bank to cut interest rates three times.",
      "The upshot for 2026, experts say, is that rate cuts are coming, but they may arrive later in the year.",

      "Grok told users that as of Friday, access to its image generation tool was limited \"to paying subscribers\" of its user verification service. Paying subscribers have to provide their credit card and personal details to the company, which could dissuade some people from using the service, especially if they had intended to use Grok's AI tool to create illegal images of minors.",
      "xAI responded to a CBS News request for comment to criticism of Grok's image generation tool and steps it had taken to limit access to it on Friday, by saying: \"Legacy media lies.\"",
      "Addressing reporters on Friday morning, a U.K. government spokesperson called the move to limit access to Grok's image editing tool to paying users \"insulting\" to victims of misogyny and sexual violence, saying it, \"simply turns an AI feature that allows the creation of unlawful images into a premium service.\"",

      "If they fail to do so, the companies can face hefty fines or, in last resort cases, face what would effectively be a ban by Britain's independent media regulator Ofcom. Ofcom can compel payment providers, advertisers and internet service providers to stop working with a site, preventing it from generating money or being accessed from the U.K.",
      "In a post shared Monday on its own X account, Ofcom said it was \"aware of serious concerns raised about a feature on Grok on X that produces undressed images of people and sexualised images of children.\"",
      "\"We have made urgent contact with X and xAI to understand what steps they have taken to comply with their legal duties to protect users in the UK. Based on their response we will undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation,\" Ofcom said.",
      "Musk's platform has faced scrutiny from governments around the world, including the European Union and the U.S. Congress, over Grok AI's digital alteration of real images.",
      "On Wednesday, Republican Senator Ted Cruz said in a post on X that \"many of the recent AI-generated posts are unacceptable and a clear violation of my legislation \u2014 now law \u2014 the\u00a0Take It Down Act, as well as X's terms and conditions.\"",
      "\"These unlawful images pose a serious threat to victims' privacy and dignity. They should be taken down and guardrails should be put in place,\" Cruz said, adding that he was encouraged by steps taken by X to remove unlawful images.",
      "On Thursday, Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, threatened to sanction the U.K. government if Starmer moved to ban X in the U.K.",
      "\"If Starmer is successful in banning @X in Britain, I will move forward with legislation that is currently being drafted to sanction not only Starmer, but Britain as a whole,\" Paulina Luna said in a post on her own X account.",

    "story": [
      "Avelo Airlines said that it will no longer carry out migrant deportation flights for the Department of Homeland Security, ending a contract that supported the U.S. government's immigration enforcement efforts.",
      "The Houston-based carrier, founded in 2021, said its deal to handle Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation flights did not sufficiently boost the airline's financial position. As a result, the low-cost carrier is shutting down its hub at Mesa Gateway Airport in Phoenix, where its migrant flight operation was based, the company said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"Avelo will close the base at [Mesa Gateway Airport] on January 27 and will conclude participation in the DHS charter program,\" an Avelo spokesperson said. \"The program provided short-term benefits but ultimately did not deliver enough consistent and predictable revenue to overcome its operational complexity and costs.\"",
      "Avelo operates low-cost flights to dozens of destinations, including the Caribbean, from four U.S. hubs. It is planning to open a fifth base in Dallas in late 2026.",
      "DHS has long partnered with CSI Aviation, which subcontracted with Avelo to provide ICE with air charter services. The federal agency also subcontracts with other charter companies, including GlobalX, which handled more than half of DHS' charter flights in 2025, according to ICE Flight Monitor at Human Rights First, a group that tracks ICE deportation flights.",
      "\"ICE never contracted directly with Avelo Airlines,\" DHS said in a statement to CBS News. \"ICE will continue to utilize its contracted service provider, which works with multiple airlines to support the American people's mandate for mass deportations of criminal illegal aliens.\"",
      "In April, Avelo founder and CEO Andrew Levy expressed confidence that the airline's deportation business would help drive the carrier's growth, while conceding that handling deportation flights was a \"sensitive and complicated topic.\"",
      "Mesa's charter program has sparked public backlash and protests against its decision to work with ICE.",
      "The Indivisible Project, a nonprofit group that led protests against Avelo Airlines, on Thursday applauded the carrier's move to end its contract with DHS.",
      "\"For months, communities across the country spoke out, organized, protested and demanded that Avelo Airlines end its deportation flights.

    "summary": "President Trump says he is directing the federal government to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, a move he said would help reduce mortgage rates at a time when Americans are worried about home prices.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said on social media Thursday that he is directing the federal government to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, a move he argued would help reduce mortgage rates at a time when Americans are worried about home prices.",
      "Mr. Trump and the White House have been trying to show they are responding to voter concerns about affordability ahead of midterm elections in November. Home prices have generally risen faster than incomes because of a persistent construction shortfall, making it harder for renters to buy their first home and for existing owners to upgrade to a new property \u2014 a challenge that dates back to Mr. Trump's first term and the recovery from the housing market collapse that triggered the global financial crisis in 2008.",
      "Mr. Trump last month said he planned to unveil housing reforms \u2014 and on Wednesday, he announced that he\u00a0wants to block institutional investors from buying houses.",
      "The president said Thursday that the two mortgage giants under government conservatorship, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, have $200 billion in cash that will be used to make the mortgage bond purchases.",
      "\"This will drive Mortgage Rates DOWN, monthly payments DOWN, and make the cost of owning a home more affordable,\" he posted on Truth Social.",
      "Federal Housing Finance Authority Director Bill Pulte, who oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, said on X the two government-run companies \"will be executing\" the president's request.",
      "The Federal Reserve has, in the past, bought mortgage bonds during times of economic turmoil in order to help reduce interest rates, leading many homeowners to refinance into rates of 3% or less. The low rates of the recent past make these homeowners reluctant to sell their properties, depriving the market of inventory.",
      "Additional mortgage purchases by Fannie Mae and Freddie could temporarily help lower mortgage costs, but that approach also could have unintended consequences, according to TD Securities analysts.",
      "\"We see this succeeding in the short term, though we believe it will reignite home prices' inflation given supply constraints,\" they said in a research note, alluding to a severe shortage of affordable housing in the U.S.",
      "Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at the real estate brokerage Redfin, estimated to the Associated Press that the government purchases of mortgage debt could shave 0.25 to 0.5 percentage points off the rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. But she also cautioned that the purchases wouldn't address other factors driving high housing costs, like limited supply.",
      "More than 75% of homes across the\u00a0U.S. are unaffordable\u00a0for most Americans, according to Bankrate, a personal finance site. Property data firm ATTOM found Thursday that in the last three months of 2025, median-priced single-family homes were less affordable than historical averages in 99% of the nearly 600 U.S. counties the company analyzed.",
      "Mortgage rates have been averaging around 6.2%, according to Freddie Mac, which went into federal conservatorship along with Fannie Mae in 2008 when the U.S. economy crashed during the Great Recession. Thirty-year mortgage rates haven't been below 6% since September 2022.",
      "Mortgage rates began to climb as inflation spiked coming out of the global pandemic, with the consumer price index hitting a four-decade high in 2022. The average mortgage rate is down from nearly 7% at the start of Mr. Trump's second term last year, yet the decrease has done little to reassure a public that feels pressure from the costs of housing, food and energy.",
      "When interest rates fall it can become cheaper to service housing debt on a monthly basis. The reduced monthly payments can improve affordability for a period until home prices adjust in response to changes in the rates. There was roughly $21.1 trillion in outstanding mortgage debt as of the middle of last year, according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve.",
      "Many homeowners took advantage of low interest rates during the pandemic to refinance their mortgages at rates of 3% or lower.",
      "The plan to buy up hundreds of billions in mortgage bonds could also carry some risk for Fannie and Freddie because Mr. Trump would be spending the cash reserves that are supposed to help be a buffer against an economic downturn akin to what happened during the Great Recession. In a sense, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae could be more vulnerable if anything negative happens to the housing market, meaning Mr. Trump is betting that possibility is highly unlikely.",
      "Fannie and Freddie work by buying up scores of residential mortgages and repackaging them as mortgage-backed securities that can be sold to all kinds of investors. Collectively, they guarantee trillions of dollars' worth of mortgages.",
      "In the past, the president has pushed to take Fannie and Freddie public. Supporters argue that move could generate hundreds of billions of dollars for the federal government, but critics warn it may push up mortgage rates by raising uncertainty about the two megafirms.",
      "But on Thursday, Mr. Trump appeared to rethink that plan, writing: \"Because I chose not to sell Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in my First Term, a truly great decision, and against the advice of the 'experts,' it is now worth many times that amount \u2014 AN ABSOLUTE FORTUNE \u2014 and has $200 BILLION DOLLARS IN CASH.\"",

      "But on Wednesday, Warner Bros. Discovery turned down the latest offer as well, stating that Paramount Skydance's bid posed \"significant costs, risks and uncertainties\" compared with the Netflix merger. Warner Bros. Discovery also said Paramount Skydance's offer would burden the combined company with significant debt.",
      "On Thursday, January 8, Paramount Skydance said it is sticking with its current offer, reiterating the company's belief that the bid is \"superior to WBD's existing agreement with Netflix.\"",

      "Netflix on Wednesday said it \"welcomed\" Warner Bros. Discovery's ongoing commitment to the companies' merger. The streaming service added that it has submitted its Hart-Scott-Rodino filing with U.S. agencies, which is required for a review of potential antitrust issues.",
      "Netflix agreed to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's HBO network, as well as its streaming and studios business, for $27.75 a share. Under the deal, Warner's cable division would be spun off into a separately run unit before the merger is completed.",

      "The advancements include helping users write messages, finding information buried in email inboxes and delivering daily to-do lists. Gmail's new AI features initially will only be available in English within the U.S. Some features will be accessible to all users free of charge, while others require G1 Ultra and Pro subscriptions.",
      "Alphabet-owned Google is rolling out the new email tools as the company weaves functionality from its latest large language model, Gemini 3, into its online search and other applications. Yet the push comes amid mounting privacy concerns around the use of generative AI, including its potential access to personal information.",
      "Personalized writing aid",
      "With the new features, all Gmail users will have access to what Google calls a 'Help Me Write' tool, which assists users with their grammar and phrasing. The tech analyzes users' previous emails to better understand their writing style so it can personalize emails and make real-time suggestions on how to respond to a message.",
      "Gmail will also offer an AI Overview feature, which summarizes email exchanges and highlights key takeaways from longer threads.",
      "Both features will be available on the Web and mobile versions of Gmail.",
      "\"This is us delivering on Gmail proactively having your back,\" said Blake Barnes, a Google vice president of product.",
      "Google is offering paid Pro and Ultra subscribers access to technology that lets users ask natural-language questions directly in the Gmail search bar. Subscribers will also have access to a dedicated chatbot for follow-up questions.",
      "For example, instead of manually searching for last month's electric bill, a user could ask, \"How much was my electric bill last month?\" Gemini would scan the user's email history, highlight the information and provide direct access to any relevant messages.",
      "Another feature, \"AI Inbox,\" is also being rolled out to a handful of customers for testing. When it's turned on, the function will sift through inboxes and suggest to-do lists and topics that users might want to explore.",

      "Incorporating AI directly into Gmail could pose risks for Google, given that large language models can sometimes present erroneous or misleading information. And although users can proofread AI-aided messages before they're sent, the tech could potentially make mistakes.",
      "Still, Gmail users can turn off the AI features. To do so, users should open their Gmail account settings and, under the \"General\" tab, scroll to the \"Smart\" features and personalization section. Users should then uncheck \"Turn on smart features in Gmail, Chat, and Meet,\" and then save their changes.",

      "The U.S. Postal Service said some mail might no longer receive a same-day postmark, the result of cost cuts to its transportation operations that may delay the arrival of posted letters at its processing facilities.",
      "The change could prove a stumbling block for people who need to ensure that mail such as bill payments, taxes or voting ballots are postmarked by specific dates. For instance, state and federal quarterly estimated taxes typically must be postmarked by January 15, April 15, June 15 and September 15 to avoid late fees.",
      "The change is part of the postal agency's 10-year plan to reduce costs and restore profitability. USPS' loss narrowed slightly in its most recent fiscal year, shrinking from $9.5 billion in 2024 to\u00a0$9 billion last year, but it continues to struggle with high costs and dwindling mail volumes.",
      "\"[W]e have made adjustments to our transportation operations that will result in some mailpieces not arriving at our originating processing facilities on the same day that they are mailed,\" the USPS said in a Jan. 2 post on its site.",
      "The agency's 10-year reorganization plan includes an overhaul of its regional transportation system, reducing the number of USPS vehicle trips for transporting mail from post offices to processing plants, where mail is postmarked, sorted and routed.",
      "That means postmarks applied at the USPS's processing facilities \"will not necessarily match the date on which the customer's mailpiece was collected by a letter carrier or dropped off at a retail location,\" the agency said.",
      "How to ensure a same-day postmark",
      "People who want to ensure their mail is postmarked with a specific date should ask USPS clerks at a branch counter to manually place a postmark on the letter or package, a USPS spokeswoman told CBS News.",
      "\"The Postal Service also offers certified mail or registered mail service at the Post Office retail counter for purchase. If a mailer purchases these services, the mailer will get a receipt that includes tracking information,\" she added.",
      "While the public, government agencies and businesses have long relied on postmarks to determine when mail was posted, the USPS said in its Jan. 2 post that the postmark \"is not and has not been a service that the Postal Service has provided to the public for such purposes.\"",
      "Instead, the postmark was used for USPS' internal operations, such as canceling postage, the agency said.",

    "story": [
      "Taxpayers eager to receive their tax refunds should mark Jan. 26, 2026, on their calendars, as the IRS said Thursday it will begin accepting federal income tax filings on that date.",
      "Annual tax refunds are typically the largest checks that households receive each year, with last year's average payment amounting to almost $3,200, according to IRS data. This year's refund season could be even larger, with the typical check set to increase by an additional $1,000, financial services company Piper Sandler said in a recent analysis.",
      "2025 tax returns will be impacted by a number of major changes signed into law through the Republicans' \"big, beautiful bill\" act, which enacted a host of new tax breaks retroactive to 2025. These include eliminating taxes on some overtime and tipped income, as well as lifting the cap on the deduction for state and local taxes, or SALT, from $10,000 to $40,000.",
      "Federal income tax returns are due April 15, although people who need more time can file for an\u00a0automatic tax extension before that. An extension gives taxpayers until Oct. 15 to file, although any taxes owed must still be paid by April 15 to avoid penalties.",
      "When will you get your refund?",
      "The question on most taxpayers' minds is how long it will take for their refund to be deposited.",
      "That depends on whether a taxpayer files electronically or submits a paper return, as well as whether the IRS identifies any problems with a filing.",
      "People who file electronically typically receive their refunds in less than 21 days. That means a taxpayer who files a Form 1040 on Jan. 26 could receive a refund by Feb. 16, assuming there are no issues with the return.",
      "Filers can use the IRS' \"Where's My Refund\" tool to check the status of their return, with the agency typically providing information about 24 hours after an electronic filing.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. trade deficit dropped sharply in October, reaching its lowest level since 2009 as imports dropped under President Trump's sweeping tariffs, according to new government data.",
      "The overall trade gap plunged 39% to $29.4 billion in October, as imports fell by 3.2%, Department of Commerce figures show. The deficit was significantly lower than the $58.4 billion median forecast from surveys of economists by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.",
      "While U.S. exports rose by $7.8 billion in October to $302 billion, imports dropped by $11 billion to $331.4 billion. The U.S. trade deficit in September was $48.1 billion.",
      "\"Swings in trade of gold and pharmaceuticals were behind the plunge in the trade deficit to a two-decade low in October, though higher computer imports suggest there are genuine signs of strength elsewhere in the economy amid the AI buildout,\" Bradley Saunders, North America economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.",
      "The release of the trade data was delayed by more than a month due to a 43-day\u00a0government shutdown last year, depriving officials and companies of updated figures as they assess the health of the world's biggest economy.",
      "The figures underscore how Mr. Trump's volatile and sweeping tariff policies have influenced trade flows. When the president unveiled wide-ranging tariffs on imports from dozens of trading partners, U.S. businesses rushed to stock up on inventory, front-loading imports ahead of planned tariff hikes.",
      "This has allowed many firms to avoid passing on the full cost of tariffs to consumers, keeping price hikes on goods relatively tame.",
      "As U.S. households grapple with an affordability crisis, Mr. Trump has more recently expanded the range of\u00a0goods exempt from tariffs, including key agricultural imports.",
      "As of mid-November, the Budget Lab at Yale University estimated that consumers face an overall average effective tariff rate topping 16%, the highest since the 1930s.",
      "Mr. Trump's country-based tariffs, imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, could still be struck down if the Supreme Court rules that Mr. Trump illegally invoked the law to enact tariffs. A ruling is expected as early as Friday.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump said on Wednesday that he will take steps to prevent institutional investors from buying single-family homes, claiming the move would help make housing more affordable for Americans.",
      "In a social media\u00a0post, Mr. Trump said that the dream of home ownership has become increasingly out of reach for many Americans, and that action is needed to allow more people to reach the milestone of owning a residence.",
      "\"I am immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes, and I will be calling on Congress to codify it,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"People live in homes, not corporations.\"",
      "He added that he will provide more details about the proposal at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, later this month.",
      "The White House declined to provide more information on Mr. Trump's plans for restricting large investors from acquiring homes.",
      "Shares of major home leasing and management companies fell sharply immediately after Mr. Trump's announcement. Invitation Homes' stock price slid more than 7%, while American Homes 4 Rent dropped 6.3%. Investment giant Blackstone, which also owns and rents homes, sank more than 4%.",
      "\"It is an idea that appeals to MAGA populists and is a policy that Vice President J.D. Vance has consistently supported,\" Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Cowen, said in a research note. \"That it comes now is an indicator of how worried Team Trump is worried about the impact of housing affordability on the midterm election.\"",
      "Seiberg expects both the House and Senate to pass bipartisan bills to implement Mr. Trump's order. \"We appreciate that many important congressional Republicans have opposed this in the past. Our view is that they will concede on this issue rather than fight the president,\" he added.",
      "Institutional investors account for roughly 1% of total single-family housing stock, according to an August analysis by researchers at the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. The study defined such investors as those owning at least 100 properties.",
      "The analysis also noted that institutional ownership varies nationwide, reaching 4.2% in Atlanta, 2.6% in Dallas and 2.2% in Houston. But these investors tend not to dominate neighborhoods, even if they're generally more concentrated in lower- and middle-income communities.",
      "Impact on home prices and rent",
      "Still, the recent rise of institutional investors purchasing single-family homes can have negative spillover effects for consumers, research shows.",
      "In 2024, the Government Accountability Office\u00a0found that institutional investment can increase rents and home prices, particularly in geographies with high concentrations of investor-owned properties.",
      "Advocates for policies benefiting property owners said they would support policies that block large investors from scooping up properties.",
      "\"We are very glad to see that the administration is squarely focusing on housing and housing affordability,\" Colin Allen, executive director of the American Property Owners Alliance,\u00a0 a nonpartisan advocacy group, told CBS News. \"Each home that is taken off the market by an institutional investor is one less for an owner-occupant to try to move into at a time when there is a lot of competition for homes for sale.\"",
      "More than 75% of homes across the U.S. are unaffordable for most Americans, according to Bankrate, a personal finance site.",
      "Data from the National Association of Realtors show that only 24% of home purchases in 2024 were made by first-time homebuyers, down from 50% in 2010. Housing economists also point to a severe shortage of inventory for the soaring cost of homes in recent years.",
      "Goldman Sachs analysts in October estimated the U.S. would need to add 3 million to 4 million homes above the normal pace of construction levels to help ease residential real estate prices.",
      "A better solution?",
      "Some experts are skeptical that Mr. Trump's proposal to restrict investor ownership of single-family homes would help ease housing costs for Americans.",
      "Institutional investors contribute to the housing supply by buying and renovating derelict homes, and then putting them back on the market, said Edward Pinto, senior fellow and co-director of the AEI Housing Center at the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "A ban on real estate trusts, private equity firms and other housing market investors from buying homes could also have unintended consequences by discouraging such players from selling their existing properties, he added.",
      "A better way to create affordable housing, Pinto said, is to make more efficient use of the nation's existing housing stock by allowing homeowners to rent out unused rooms tax-free, and also by incentivizing states to build more homes.",

      "Amazon customers can now file a claim under its $2.5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, which resolved allegations of deceptive enrollment practices in the retailer's Prime shopping service.",
      "As part of the September 2025 settlement, Amazon is offering $1.5 billion in refunds to eligible customers, as well as paying a $1 billion civil penalty. The FTC had alleged that Amazon duped customers into signing up for Prime and made it hard for customers to cancel their membership.",
      "Amazon neither admitted nor denied the allegations as part of the settlement. Here's what to know.",
      "How do you file a claim in the Amazon Prime FTC settlement?",
      "Amazon customers should go to the settlement website to file their claim. Although millions of eligible customers will receive automatic payments through the settlement without filing a claim, some will need to submit one, the site notes.",

      "How much money will Amazon customers receive?",
      "People who qualify can receive a refund of their Amazon Prime membership fees, up to $51, according to the settlement site.",

      "When will you get the Amazon Prime refund?",
      "Customers will be contacted by email or mail (postmarked by January 23) to inform them if they are eligible, according to the settlement site.",

    "story": [
      "The Alaska Airlines pilot who has been universally praised as a hero for safely landing a jet after a door plug panel flew off shortly after takeoff is suing Boeing because he believes the plane maker wrongly tried to blame him and the rest of the crew.",
      "Captain Brandon Fisher was commended by the heads of the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration and even Boeing executives for helping ensure none of the 177 people aboard flight 1282 were killed when the blowout happened in January 2024.",
      "But Fisher's lawyers say Boeing's attempts to deflect liability in past lawsuits despite what the NTSB investigation found led to the pilot being sued by some passengers and caused him great distress. Still, experts say it's unusual for a pilot to sue like this in an incident where he wasn't seriously hurt or killed. Four flight attendants previously sued Boeing over the incident last summer.",
      "Fisher's lawsuit says Boeing suggested it wasn't responsible because the plane was \"improperly maintained or misused\" by others.",
      "\"It was clear Boeing's words were directed at Captain Fisher in attempt to paint him as the scapegoat for Boeing's numerous failures,\" Fisher's lawyers, William Walsh and Richard Mummolo, wrote in the lawsuit filed in an Oregon court.",
      "Key bolts were missing",
      "The NTSB investigation of the blowout found that four bolts securing what is known as the door plug panel were removed and never replaced during a repair as the Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft was being assembled. Boeing and key supplier Spirit Aerosystems, which has since been acquired by Boeing, were both implicated.",
      "The bolts are hidden behind interior panels in the plane, so they are not something that could have been easily checked in a preflight inspection by the pilot or anyone else from the airline. NTSB investigators determined the door plug was gradually moving upward over the 154 flights prior to the incident before it ultimately flew off.",
      "\"Boeing's lie infuriated Captain Fisher as well, as he was being castigated for his actions as opposed to being lauded,\" Fisher's lawyers wrote. \"Because he had flown Boeing aircraft for the entirety of his employment with Alaska Airlines, Boeing's attempts to blame him felt like a deep, personal betrayal by a company that claimed to hold pilots in the highest regard.\"",
      "The NTSB made clear this was caused by a manufacturing issue and the crew's actions were exemplary. Experienced pilot John Cox, who is CEO of the Safety Operating Systems aviation safety consulting firm, said the crew did a remarkable job considering what they were dealing with, and no one has faulted the crew.",
      "\"I think the Boeing lawyers were kind of grasping at straws,\" Cox said.",
      "Terrifying moments",
      "The blowout occurred minutes after the flight took off from Portland, Oregon, and created a roaring air vacuum. Seven passengers and one flight attendant sustained minor injuries, but the plane landed safely.",
      "\"The first indication was an explosion in my ears and then a whoosh of air,\" First Officer Emily Wiprud told CBS News in an exclusive interview in 2024. \"My body was forced forward and there was a loud bang as well. ... The flight deck door was open. I saw tubes hanging from the cabin.\"",
      "Wiprud said that at that point, she didn't know what was wrong. Instinct took over, and she and the captain started working to land safely.",
      "\"I didn't know that there was a hole in the airplane until we landed,\" Wiprud said. \"I knew something was catastrophically wrong.\"",
      "The 2-foot-by-4-foot piece of fuselage covering an unused emergency exit behind the left wing had blown out. Only seven seats on the flight were unoccupied, including the two seats closest to the opening.",
      "A teen aboard the flight\u00a0had his shirt ripped off his body.\u00a0 Multiple objects, including the\u00a0phones of two passengers, Wiprud's headset and multiple aircraft components, were sucked out of the aircraft.",
      "Shandy Brewer was sitting in Row 10 on the flight when the door blew off. It was an experience that stuck with her 18 months later.",
      "\"All of a sudden, just this huge bang happened. It sounded like a firework going off, like right in your ears, just like so loud,\" she recalled. \"As soon as I step onto an airplane, tears start pouring down my face every single time. I haven't been on a flight where that doesn't happen.\"",
      "Boeing factory workers told NTSB investigators they felt pressured to work too fast and were asked to perform jobs they weren't qualified for.",
      "Fisher's lawsuit describes how he and the first officer acted quickly after losing cabin pressure when the panel blew out to fly the plane safely back to Portland while decreasing altitude and working with air traffic controllers to avoid any other planes in the area.",
      "The airline didn't answer a question about whether Fisher is still flying for them, and the lawsuit described him as a citizen and well-respected member of the aviation community. It wasn't clear Tuesday whether he is still working as a pilot.",
      "Working to improve safety",
      "The head of the commercial airplane unit at Boeing at the time, Stan Deal, commended the Alaska Airlines crew for safely landing the plane in a memo to employees after the incident.",
      "Boeing did not comment directly on this new lawsuit. But the company's CEO, Kelly Ortberg, has made improving safety a top priority ever since he took over the top job at Boeing in August 2024.",
      "The FAA fined Boeing $3.1 million over safety violations inspectors found after the door plug incident. In October, the agency allowed Boeing to increase production of the 737 Max to 42 planes a month because inspectors were satisfied with the measures the company had taken to improve safety.",
      "Alaska Airlines also declined to comment on the lawsuit, but said the airline remains \"grateful to our crew members for the bravery and quick-thinking that they displayed on Flight 1282 in ensuring the safety of all on board.\"",

    "story": [
      "Airlines are serving \"potentially unhealthy water\" to passengers, according to a new study, with researchers recommending that travelers stick to bottled water and avoid drinking coffee or tea served on aircraft.",
      "The nonprofit Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity, which examined more than 35,000 water samples served by 10 major and 11 regional airlines over three years, also urges passengers to avoid washing their hands in aircraft bathrooms and instead stick to using hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.",
      "Among major U.S. airlines, three \u2014 American Airlines, JetBlue and Spirit \u2014 earned a \"D\" rating from the group, according to the analysis. Delta and Frontier were the top-ranked major carriers, both earning \"A\" grades for their water.",
      "Water quality may not be a top-of-mind airline safety issue with passengers, but it's nevertheless an \"important public health consideration,\" the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity noted in its analysis. Drinking potentially contaminated aircraft water can result in issues such as gastrointestinal illness and exposure to pathogens, the group added.",
      "What the study found",
      "The analysis found that 2.7% of samples tested positive for total coliform, a group of bacteria that's found in the digestive tracts of humans and animals, as well as in plants and soil.",
      "\"Testing for coliform bacteria is important because their presence in drinking water indicates that disease-causing organisms (pathogens) could be in the water system,\" the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity said in its report.",
      "E. coli was identified 32 times across the 21 airlines, the group said.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency established the Aircraft Drinking Water Rule, or ADWR, in 2011, which applies to U.S. carriers with onboard drinking water systems for passengers and crew. The rule requires airlines to test for coliform bacteria and possible E. coli, as well as to disinfect and flush each aircraft's water tank four times a year.",
      "But the EPA rarely levies civil penalties to airlines that violate the ADWR, the study noted.",
      "Airlines respond",
      "American Airlines told CBS News it is \"closely reviewing\" the findings.",
      "\"American's potable water program is fully in compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Aircraft Drinking Water Rule (ADWR),\" the carrier told CBS News. \"A recent EPA audit showed there were no significant findings with our program, and we have not received any violations for any potable water cabinets or trucks that we use.\"",
      "JetBlue said in a statement that it follows processes outlined by the EPA, the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration to ensure safe water. The airline added that it serves bottled drinking water on its flights.",
      "Spirit also said it maintains a comprehensive testing and maintenance program that complies with the EPA's aircraft drinking water rule.",
      "\"The well-being and comfort of our guests is very important to us,\" the company told CBS News in a statement. \"Our data shows we have made progress in this area in recent years, and we continue to evaluate and refine our procedures as necessary.\"",
      "Southwest Airlines, which received a \"C\" grade, said it regularly inspects the water quality aboard its planes and that it complies with EPA standards. The company also said it only uses water from local municipal public water systems that already meet standards for residents and businesses.",
      "On its website, the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity describes its mission as \"creating a more equitable food system that will improve health outcomes.\"",

    "summary": "A prediction market user won big after wagering $32,000 that the U.S. would capture former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Was it insider trading?",
    "story": [
      "A trader made more than $436,000 on a prediction market by appearing to anticipate former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's capture\u00a0by U.S. forces last weekend, raising questions about the timing of the bet and the integrity of such online futures trading platforms.",
      "An anonymous user on Polymarket won the payout after\u00a0placing\u00a0a roughly $32,000 wager on Maduro's removal \u2014 just before President Trump announced the U.S. had ousted the former leader.",
      "The longshot wager raises questions about the anonymous bettor's identity and potential access to inside information ahead of the U.S. operation to seize Maduro and his wife, legal and financial experts told CBS News.",
      "Polymarket, a New York-based cryptocurrency prediction market that recently secured a $2 billion investment from stock exchange operator Intercontinental Exchange, is currently pursuing regulatory approval in the U.S.",
      "Suspicious timing?",
      "A Polymarket account holder, who appeared to join the trading platform in December, bet $32,537 on the likelihood that Maduro would be \"out by January 31, 2026.\" The speculative investment was placed shortly before Mr. Trump announced Maduro's arrest at 4:21 a.m. Saturday on Truth Social.",
      "Experts said several indicators suggest the bettor could have had access to classified information regarding the U.S. operation to capture Maduro.",
      "\"It clearly suggests that the bettor did have access to inside information,\" said Dennis Kelleher, cofounder and CEO of Better Markets, a nonpartisan advocacy group focused on financial reform. \"This particular bet has all the hallmarks of a trade based on inside information. It happened very late, right before the very event they were betting on happened; it was a relatively large amount of money; and it happened in a market that is not really regulated and where there is no transparency.\"",
      "Three additional bets were made via the same Polymarket account: a $1,000 wager on the U.S. invading Venezuela by January 31; a $250 wager that Mr. Trump would invoke the War Powers Act against Venezuela by January 31; and a $146 wager that U.S. forces would land in Venezuela by the end of the month.",
      "\"It was a new account only betting on issues around the Venezuelan president's potential removal from office \u2014 there are a lot of telltale signs that make it seem like insider trading,\" Stephen Piepgrass, a regulatory attorney at Troutman Pepper Locke who specializes in futures trading, told CBS News.",
      "Polymarket did not respond to a request for comment on the Maduro-related bets. Last fall, company CEO Shayne Coplan told CBS News that insiders \"having an edge to the market is a good thing.\"",
      "\"Obviously, you need to curate them and you need to be really clear and stringent on where the line is drawn and, like, sort of ethics, and we spend a lot of time on that. But it's sort of an inevitability that this will happen, and there's a lot of benefits from it. And, you know, people will adapt,\" he told 60 Minutes' Anderson Cooper.",
      "Uneven playing field?",
      "The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is the government agency tasked with regulating prediction markets such as Polymarket and Kalshi, another online betting platform that lets consumers bet on a range of news, sports and other events.",
      "But Kelleher contends that the commission's oversight of prediction markets is weak.",
      "\"These kinds of gambling markets are almost entirely unregulated. The CFTC is supposed to regulate, but it doesn't have the money, personnel or expertise to do it,\" he said. \"This isn't a case of light-touch regulation \u2014 it's a case of no-touch regulation.\"",
      "The CFTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Polymarket wager could violate the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), a federal law regulating futures and options trading, experts told CBS News. Specifically, the CEA prohibits gambling on events related to assassination, terrorism and war.",
      "Kelleher also said the incident highlights the potential risks for other prediction market users.",
      "\"Consumers and investors should know that these are totally unregulated, non-transparent markets and that the odds of losing money are incredibly high,\" he said.",
      "Piepgrass told CBS News that the Maduro bet marks a \"flashpoint\" in the debate around what he characterized as inadequate regulation of such markets. Enabling insiders with access to confidential information to place bets on the trading forums would disadvantage other customers, he said.",
      "\"It's about fundamental fairness,\" Piepgrass said. \"Do you want to be placing bets in an area where some people have information directly relevant to winning that bet, but you do not? If you are a consumer, you have to really question, is that a market you want to participate in.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 17:36:28 -0500",
    "summary": "Travel insurance won't help most people whose flights were disrupted by the turmoil in Venezuela. Here's what such policies do cover.",
    "story": [
      "Thousands of people were stranded abroad because their flights home were scrapped after the U.S. temporarily shut down airspace around Venezuela following the capture of former President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Some travellers remain stuck because airlines rebooked them on flights that don't leave for days, while others face thousands of dollars in extra travel-related expenses, such as lodging costs. Now, industry experts are advising them to ask airlines for refunds and, for those with travel insurance, to file a claim.",
      "On Saturday, the day of the attack, roughly 1,130 flights within, into or out of the U.S., were cancelled, hundreds of which were scheduled to depart from Aruba, Puerto Rico, St. Thomas and other Caribbean islands, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. Airlines have since resumed service in the region after the flight restrictions were lifted.",
      "What travel insurance doesn't cover",
      "If you're already on a trip, of course, it's too late to purchase travel insurance.",
      "\"It's like buying car insurance after you hit a tree,\" Suzanne Morrow, CEO of InsureMyTrip, a travel insurance comparison site, told CBS News.",
      "Even if you have coverage, meanwhile, there are limitations. Most travel policies include exclusions that might apply to trip interruptions of the sort that led to the now-lifted restrictions on Caribbean airspace. That can make it hard for purchasers of travel insurance to know if a policy will protect them.",
      "\"Coverage decisions are based on policy language and official determinations. My recommendation is to save all of your receipts for every expense incurred,\" Morrow said.",
      "Specifically, most policies expressly exclude coverage when a policyholder's trip is disrupted due to an act of war, terrorism, or civil unrest, she noted. Such determinations are based on airlines' stated reasons for cancelling flights.",
      "As a result, payouts for delayed trips might not\u00a0apply to the Venezuela flight restrictions, Jeff Rolander, vice president of claims and customer experience at Faye Travel Insurance, told CBS News.",
      "\"Insurers have been assessing the situation to determine if coverage will apply, and acts of war are a general exclusion under all travel insurance policies,\" he said.",
      "What travel insurance does cover",
      "People who bought travel insurance are generally entitled to compensation when an airline cancels a flight because of a mechanical issue or other problem within the carrier's control.",
      "\"Standard travel insurance policies are designed to protect against baggage loss or flight delays due to an airline issue,\" said Chrissy Valdez, senior director of operations at Square Mouth, a travel insurance comparison site.",
      "The policies can also protect travellers if they need to cancel trips for personal emergencies, such as illness or injury.",
      "Many travel insurance providers also offer add-ons that provide coverage for trips that are interrupted for \"any reason,\" but such an upgrade has to be purchased in advance.",
      "Valdez said some fliers could be eligible for compensation for a cancelled flight if the rebooked flight is cancelled due to an airline issue.",
      "\"Sometimes, because of airspace closures, airlines are trying to catch up and there may not be aircraft available. Mechanical issues could prevent them from adding additional aircraft to the fleet, and those kinds of things could still be covered,\" she said.",
      "The average cost of travel insurance is around $21 a day, according to Square Mouth. A policy's pricing is based on trip costs and the breadth of coverage.",
      "Always file a claim",
      "For travellers whose flights are cancelled, Morrow said the first course of action beyond saving receipts should be to file a claim with their airline for any added expenses. Those costs could include meals, lodging and other costs incurred as a result of a flight cancellation.",
      "\"Go through the process, whether or not they cover anything. At least make the effort to get compensation, particularly if you don't have insurance,\" she advised.",
      "If you do have travel coverage, your provider can also help with rebooking flights and finding alternate accommodations in the interim.",
      "\"Travel insurance does so much more than reimburse for expenses. It also comes with assistance benefits that can help when trips are interrupted,\" Morrow said.",

      "Representatives from petroleum giants Chevron, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil are planning to meet with the Trump administration later this week to discuss Venezuela, two sources confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The meeting is expected to take place Wednesday with Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who is attending the Goldman Sachs Energy Conference in Miami, a Department of Energy spokesperson said.",
      "The meetings come as President Trump pushes U.S. oil companies to invest in Venezuela's oil industry, following the U.S. military's capture of former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on Saturday.",
      "Venezuela is estimated to have the world's largest proven oil reserves, but its oil industry has languished after years of mismanagement, underinvestment and tight U.S. sanctions. The country produces around 1 million barrels of crude oil per day, according to OPEC, most of which is exported to China \u2014 representing less than 1% of global oil production.",
      "Chevron is the only major U.S. petroleum company that currently operates in Venezuela under a special license from the Treasury Department. ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips left the country in 2007, after Maduro's predecessor, Hugo Chavez, demanded that Venezuela's state-run oil company take majority stakes in the country's oil ventures.",
      "It remains uncertain whether U.S. firms will reinvest in Venezuela right away. Experts say it would take companies years to build out their operations in Venezuela, and many oil companies could tread lightly because of political uncertainty.",
      "White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said: \"All of our oil companies are ready and willing to make big investments in Venezuela that will rebuild their oil infrastructure, which was destroyed by the illegitimate Maduro regime. American oil companies will do an incredible job for the people of Venezuela and will represent the United States well.\"",
      "A Chevron spokesperson declined to comment to CBS News on whether it plans to boost production in Venezuela, saying it \"remains focused on the safety and well-being of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets.\"",
      "A ConocoPhillips spokesperson said it would be \"premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments.\" ExxonMobil did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "American Petroleum Institute spokesperson Bethany Williams said the trade group is \"closely watching developments involving Venezuela.\"",
      "\"Globally, energy companies make investment decisions based on stability, the rule of law, market forces, and long-term operational considerations,\" Williams added.",
      "Editor's Note: This article has been updated to reflect that Wright is now expected to meet with oil companies on Wednesday, not Thursday.",

      "Despite repeated attempts to raise the federal minimum wage, the national baseline hourly rate has remained at $7.25 since 2009. In the meantime, many states and municipalities have boosted their wage floors through a patchwork of ballot measures and legislation. These changes are often framed as a way to combat inflation, which has cooled since 2022 but remains a pain point for many Americans.",

      "The average price of gas around the U.S. this year is expected to dip to $2.97 per gallon, down 13 cents from 2025 \u2014 that would be the lowest level since 2020, according to a new analysis by GasBuddy.",
      "At the end of 2025, average U.S. prices at the pump\u00a0dipped below $3, with GasBuddy citing strong refinery output, lower oil prices, robust crude production and softer seasonal demand as the main reasons behind the decline.",
      "\"It's not a return to ultra-cheap fuel, but for the first time in a long time, the wind is clearly behind drivers' backs,\" Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, said in a statement.",
      "Expect a rise, then a dip",
      "While prices are expected to average below $3 in 2026, GasBuddy says drivers should expect some volatility throughout the year due to seasonal demand, weather and geopolitical risks.",
      "The company, whose app helps drivers save money on fuel, predicts gas prices will edge up to around $3.20 between spring and early summer before falling to an average of $2.83 after June.",
      "That would mirror normal seasonal fluctuations. Gas prices tend to rise in the spring and fall in the winter, when fuel demand typically weakens.",

      "Following last weekend's capture of\u00a0Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife, President Trump said that American oil companies would play a key role in reviving Venezuela's\u00a0languishing oil industry.",
      "That could be easier said than done. Persuading U.S. energy players to return to Venezuela will require the Caracas government to reassert political stability in a country racked by years of political turmoil, experts told CBS News.",
      "Meanwhile, risk-averse American companies are unlikely to invest the billions of dollars required to upgrade Venezuela's creaking oil infrastructure until they have more clarity on the legal and fiscal landscape following Maduro's removal.",
      "Shaky ground",
      "\"Companies will need a stable physical environment, which is highly uncertain at this point,\" David Goldwyn, president of Goldwyn Global Strategies, an international energy advisory consultancy, and also the chairman of the energy advisory group at the nonpartisan Atlantic Council, told CBS News in an email.",
      "U.S. energy companies will wait to see what financial and contractual terms they receive from the Venezuelan government to re-enter the country, as well as how the commercial opportunities stack up in Venezuela compared with other investments worldwide, Goldwyn said.",
      "Although Chevron already operates in Venezuela, oil companies including\u00a0Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips\u00a0no longer have a presence in the country after former President Hugo Chavez effectively ejected them by nationalizing their assets in 2007.",
      "As a result, it would take new entrants to the Venezuelan market several years to build out their operations, requiring long-term\u00a0 \u2014 and thus riskier \u2014 calculations about the cost of production and oil prices, Goldwyn said.",
      "Any U.S. investment would also require establishing a new contractual agreement with Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA), Venezuela's state-owned oil and gas company, according to a J.P. Morgan Markets analysis.",
      "\"U.S. companies could happily work with the national oil company, but they prefer to control their own operations, so a majority stake would be preferable,\" Goldwyn added.",
      "Meanwhile, thorny legal issues would likely need to be resolved over outstanding compensation claims by Exxon and ConocoPhillips stemming from Chavez effectively tearing up their contracts, J.P. Morgan analysts Natasha Kaneva and Lyuba Savinova said in a report.",
      "$100 billion gamble?",
      "Perhaps most daunting is the sheer level of investment required to modernize Venezuela's oil infrastructure \u2014 an effort that could take a decade and cost up to $100 billion, said Francisco J. Monaldi, director of the Latin America energy program at Rice University.",
      "According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), Venezuela's aging pipelines for transporting oil from wells to refineries haven't been upgraded in roughly 50 years. As of 2023, that network consisted of 25 operational pipelines and is prone to daily spills, the agency notes.",
      "\"Investment terms \u2014 including confidence they will endure \u2014 and the oil price environment need to be conducive to such investments,\" energy analysts with S&P Global said in a report.",
      "Venezuela now accounts for 0.8% of global oil output, ranking it No. 18 among the world's oil producers, according to Capital Economics. Yet it accounts for roughly 9% of the worldwide market for \"heavy\" crude oil, which is used to make diesel, jet fuel, home heating oil and other purposes.",
      "A spokesperson for Chevron, which operates in Venezuela under a special U.S. license, declined to comment on whether the company has any plans to scale up production in the country following Maduro's removal.",
      "\"Chevron remains focused on the safety and well-being of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets,\" the spokesperson told CBS News in an email. \"We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.\"",
      "A ConocoPhillips spokesperson said the company is monitoring developments in Venezuela, adding that it would be \"premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments.\" Exxon did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "Other U.S. energy companies could still benefit even without injecting capital into on-the-ground facilities in Venezuela, Monaldi said.

      "The starting dose of the daily Wegovy pill, at 1.5 milligrams, is now available for $149 per month for self-paying patients,\u00a0Novo Nordisk announced on Monday. A 4 mg dose of the medication is available for the same price through April 15, after which the cost will rise to $199.",
      "Ed Cinca, senior vice president of marketing and patient solutions at Novo Nordisk, said in a statement that the new drug represents a \"significant innovation,\" describing it as the \"first and only\" GLP-1 pill for weight loss.",

      "The Novo Nordisk pill contains 25 milligrams of semaglutide, the same ingredient in injectables Wegovy and Ozempic. It also has similar side effects as the injectable version of the medication, including nausea and diarrhea, according to Novo Nordisk.",
      "The new Wegovy pill provides Americans an alternative, and more convenient, option than injectable treatments, which have dominated the weight-loss market since they were introduced. Roughly 1 in 8 Americans has used an injectable GLP-1 drug for weight loss or another condition, according to a recent\u00a0survey\u00a0from nonprofit group KFF.",

NATO allies and Greenland have disagreed with Mr. Trump's assessment.",
      "\"If we don't do it the easy way, we're going to do it the hard way,\" Mr. Trump said, without explaining what that entailed. The White House stated that it is considering a range of options, including the use of military force, to acquire the island.

    "summary": "President Trump called for a one-year cap on credit card interest rates late Friday, an idea that has drawn strong support from lawmakers in both parties but pushback from card issuers.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is calling for a 10% cap on credit card interest rates for one year, an idea that has drawn strong support from lawmakers in both parties but pushback from card issuers.",
      "\"Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%, and even more, which festered unimpeded during the Sleepy Joe Biden Administration,\" the president wrote on Truth Social late Friday.",
      "Mr. Trump said the cap on interest rates should begin on Jan. 20, 2026, or the one-year anniversary of his second inauguration.",
      "Credit card interest rates currently average over 20%, according to Federal Reserve statistics, so a 10% cap would represent a significant cut in borrowing costs.",
      "It's unclear if the president will attempt to enforce his proposed 10% cap through some kind of executive action, or if his goal is to pressure credit card issuers to slash their rates voluntarily. CBS News has reached out to the White House and some of the largest credit card issuers in the U.S. for comment.",
      "Supporters point to trillions in credit card debt",
      "The idea of capping credit card interest rates has drawn bipartisan support. Last year, Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri and independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who caucuses with Democrats, teamed up to introduce legislation that would impose a 10% cap. A similar measure was also introduced in the House by Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida.",
      "Other recently proposed legislation would impose less stringent caps on fees and interest rates.",
      "Mr. Trump also called for temporarily capping interest rates at 10% on the campaign trail. Hours before the president's late Friday Truth Social post, Sanders criticized Mr. Trump on X\u00a0 for not following through on his pledge to limit interest rates.",
      "Supporters of the idea say it would aid scores of Americans who are languishing under mountains of credit card debt, and argue that credit card issuers can afford to cut their rates.",
      "Americans owed a total of $1.23 trillion in credit card balances in the third quarter of last year, the highest level on record, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. A 2024 study by NerdWallet found that the average U.S. household with credit card debt owed $10,563. Meanwhile, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found in 2023 that credit card rates have soared \"far above the cost of offering credit.\"",
      "\"We cannot continue to allow big banks to make huge profits ripping off the American people,\" Sanders said in a joint press release with Hawley last year.",
      "Said Luna: \"For too long, credit card companies have abused working class Americans with absurd interest rates, trapping them in an almost insurmountable amount of debt.\"",
      "Opponents argue a credit card rate cap could backfire",
      "Opponents of a cap, including banks and other credit card issuers, warn that limits on interest rates may force lenders to stop issuing credit cards to many riskier borrowers.",
      "A coalition of groups that represent banks \u2014 including the American Bankers Association and the Bank Policy Institute \u2014 argued in a statement to CBS News on Friday that a 10% interest rate cap \"would reduce credit availability and be devastating for millions of American families and small business owners who rely on and value their credit cards, the very consumers this proposal intends to help.\"",
      "The Bank Policy Institute estimated last year that more than 14 million American households that rarely pay their credit card balances in full could have their access to credit eliminated or curtailed by a 10% cap. Millions of people who sometimes pay off their balances could also face new restrictions, the group said.",
      "The American Bankers Association has\u00a0argued in the past that if credit card issuers end up needing to cut off access for \"all but the lowest-risk customers,\" many people who are in need of loans would be forced to shift to \"less regulated alternatives\" that often charge even higher rates, like payday lenders and pawn shops.",
      "Billionaire investor Bill Ackman, who backed Mr. Trump in his 2024 campaign, called the idea a \"mistake.\" He\u00a0wrote on X\u00a0that if card issuers are prevented from charging high enough interest rates to cover their losses and earn solid returns, \"credit card lenders will cancel cards for millions of consumers who will have to turn to loan sharks.\"",
      "Ackman later wrote: \"Finding a way to bring down credit card rates without taking credit away from many Americans would have a very positive impact on the most disadvantaged Americans.\"",
      "Scott Simpson, CEO of the trade group America's Credit Unions, told CBS News in a statement: \"While we appreciate the President's desire to increase affordability, the plain truth is that capping rates at 10% does not make credit more affordable, it makes it unattainable for millions of working Americans because financial institutions will not be able to offer credit cards to most consumers at a 10% rate.\"",
      "The Electronic Payments Coalition \u2014 which represents credit card issuers and payment networks \u2014 said \"a one-size-fits-all 10% cap risks making things worse by reducing access to credit and limiting choice.\"",
      "Trump pledges to deal with affordability",
      "The push to cap credit card interest rates is the latest proposal by Mr. Trump to cut borrowing costs, as he grapples with widespread concerns about affordability.",
      "Earlier this week, Mr. Trump directed the federal government to buy $200 million in mortgage bonds using cash from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in an effort to drive down mortgage rates.",
      "The president has also urged the Federal Reserve to more aggressively cut its benchmark interest rate, which influences borrowing costs for everything from mortgages and car loans to commercial loans \u2014 though rate cuts by the Fed could run the risk of causing inflation to surge.",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to nominate a new Federal Reserve chair in the coming weeks, and told reporters last month he's \"looking for somebody that will be honest with interest rates.\"",

      "President Trump disclosed U.S. jobs data the day before the Department of Labor released\u00a0hiring numbers for December, a closely watched economic report on Wall Street that can sway financial markets.",
      "At 8:20 p.m. EST on Thursday, Mr. Trump\u00a0posted a graph depicting changes in private and government employment since January 2025. When the full jobs report was released Friday morning, it became clear that Mr. Trump's post had incorporated the December employment data because the totals in the chart matched figures released in the monthly report.",
      "Mr. Trump brushed off the incident. \"I don't know if they posted them,\" he told reporters Friday afternoon. \"They gave me some numbers. When people give me things, I post them.\"",
      "A White House official told CBS News that Mr. Trump's post came after he was briefed on the employment numbers, calling it an \"inadvertent public disclosure of aggregate data that was partially derived from pre-released information.\"",
      "The White House is now reviewing its protocols for economic data releases, the official added.",
      "Cooler hiring",
      "The government's latest jobs report shows that hiring cooled in December, with employers adding 50,000 jobs, while the nation's unemployment rate ticked down to 4.4%. The economy added roughly 584,000 jobs for all of 2025, down from more than 2 million in 2024, labor data shows.",
      "Federal economic data is held under strict embargo until its scheduled release because the information has the potential to move financial markets. Providing some investors with access to such data could allow them to place trades based on knowledge unavailable to other investors.",
      "White House economic officials are provided with an advance copy of the Labor Department's employment report each month on Thursday afternoon and sign agreements to keep the numbers confidential, though they also write up a summary for the president, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Data leaks can undermine investor confidence, as markets expect officials to keep a tight lid on economic reports until they're released publicly, Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, told CBS News.",
      "\"Markets don't react kindly to that, because obviously it means that perhaps a select few may have been able to front-run on that news ahead of the market at large,\" he said.",
      "Erica Groshen, a former commissioner at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unit that compiles the monthly employment figures, said that premature disclosures of the agency's data can be punished by fines and even jail time.

    "summary": "Lawmakers are demanding a range of actions, from a full investigation and policy changes to the defunding of ICE operations and the impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.",
    "story": [
      "The\u00a0killing of a Minnesota woman\u00a0by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer is reverberating across Capitol Hill, where Democrats and certain Republicans are vowing an assertive response as President Trump's aggressive deportation operations spark protests nationwide.",
      "Lawmakers are demanding a range of actions, from a full investigation into\u00a0Renee Good's shooting death\u00a0and policy changes over law enforcement raids to the defunding of ICE operations and the impeachment of\u00a0Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, in what is fast becoming an inflection point.",
      "\"The situation that took place in Minnesota is a complete and total disgrace,\" House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said as details emerged. \"And in the next few days, we will be having conversations about a strong and forceful and appropriate response by House Democrats.\"",
      "Yet there is almost no consensus among the political parties in the aftermath of the death of Good, who was behind the wheel of an SUV after dropping off her 6-year-old at school when she was shot and killed by\u00a0an ICE officer.",
      "The killing immediately drew dueling narratives. Mr. Trump and Noem said the\u00a0ICE officer acted in self-defense, while Democratic officials said the Trump administration was lying and they urged the public to see the viral videos of the shooting for themselves.",
      "Vice President\u00a0JD Vance\u00a0blamed Good, calling it \"a tragedy of her own making,\" and said the ICE officer may have been \"sensitive\" from having been injured during an unrelated altercation last year.",
      "But Good's killing, at least the fifth known death since the administration launched its mass deportation campaign, could change the political dynamic.",
      "\"The videos I've seen from Minneapolis yesterday are deeply disturbing,\" said Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska, in a statement.",
      "\"As we mourn this loss of life, we need a thorough and objective investigation into how and why this happened,\" she said. As part of the investigation, she said she is calling for policy changes, saying the situation \"was devastating, and cannot happen again.\"",
      "Homeland Security funding up for debate",
      "The push in Congress for more oversight and accountability of the administration's immigration operations comes as lawmakers are in the midst of the annual appropriations process to fund agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, to prevent another\u00a0federal government shutdown\u00a0when money expires at the end of January.",
      "As anti-ICE demonstrations erupt in cities in the aftermath of Good's death, Democrats have pledged to use any available legislative lever to apply pressure on the administration to change the conduct of ICE officers.",
      "\"We've been warning about this for an entire year,\" said Rep. Maxwell Frost, a Florida Democrat.",
      "The ICE officer \"needs to be held accountable,\" Frost said, \"but not just them, but ICE as a whole, the president and this entire administration.\"",
      "Congressional Democrats saw Good's killing as a sign of the need for aggressive action to restrain the administration's tactics.",
      "Several Democrats joined calls to impeach Noem, who has been under fire from both parties for her lack of transparency at the department, though that step is highly unlikely with Republicans in control of Congress.",
      "Other Democrats want to restrict the funding for her department, whose budget was vastly increased as part of the Republicans' sweeping tax and spending bill passed last summer.",
      "Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, the top Democrat on the subcommittee that handles Homeland Security funding, plans to introduce legislation to rein in the agency with constraints on federal agents' authority, including a requirement that the Border Patrol stick to the border and that DHS enforcement officers be unmasked.",
      "\"More Democrats are saying today the thing that a number of us have been saying since April and May: Kristi Noem is dangerous. She should not be in office, and she should be impeached,\" said Democratic Rep. Delia Ramirez, who represents parts of Chicago where ICE launched an enhanced immigration enforcement action last year that resulted in two deaths.",
      "Immigration debates have long divided Congress and the parties. Democrats are splintering between more liberal and stricter attitudes toward newcomers to the United States. Republicans have embraced Trump's hard-line approach to portray Democrats as radicals.",
      "The Republican administration had launched the enforcement operation in Minnesota in response to an investigation of the nonprofit Feeding Our Future. Prosecutors said the organization was at the center of the country's largest COVID-19-related fraud scams, when defendants exploited a state-run, federally funded program intended to provide food for children.",
      "Heading into the November midterm election, which Democrats believe will hinge on issues such as affordability and health care, national outcry over ICE's conduct has pressured lawmakers to speak out.",
      "\"I'm not completely against deportations, but the way they're handling it is a real disgrace,\" said Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat who represents a district along the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "\"Right now, you're seeing humans treated like animals,\" he said.",
      "Other ICE shootings have rattled lawmakers",
      "In September, a federal immigration enforcement agent in Chicago\u00a0fatally shot Silverio Villegas Gonzalez\u00a0during a brief altercation after Gonzalez had dropped off his children at school.",
      "In October, a Customs and Border Protection agent, also in Chicago, shot Marimar Martinez, a teacher and U.S. citizen, five times during a dispute with officers. The charges against Martinez brought by the administration were dismissed by a federal judge.",
      "To Rep. Chuy Garcia, a Democrat from Illinois, Good's death \"brought back heart-wrenching memories of those two shootings in my district.\"",
      "\"It looks like the fact that a US citizen, who is a white woman, may be opening the eyes of the American public, certainly of members of Congress, that what's going on is out of control,\" he said, \"that this isn't about apprehending or pursuing the most dangerous immigrants.\"",
      "Republicans expressed some concern at the shooting but stood by the administration's policy, defended the officer's actions and largely blamed Good for the standoff.",
      "\"Nobody wants to see people get shot,\" said Rep. Rich McCormick, a Republican from Georgia.",
      "\"Let's do the right thing and just be reasonable. And the reasonable thing is not to obstruct ICE officers and then accelerate while they're standing in front of your car,\" he said. \"She made a mistake. I'm sure she didn't mean for that to happen, nor did he mean for that to happen.\"",

      "\"Despite a staggering, wide-reaching fraud scandal, your Administrations refuse to provide basic information or take common sense measures to stop fraud,\" Rollins said in the letter, which she posted on social media.",
      "She asked Walz and Frey to provide her agency with justification for all federal spending to the state from Jan. 20 of last year \"to the present\" within 30 days, and said that payments moving forward will \"require such payment justification.\"",

      "At the time, the reports prompted pushback from California officials, including Lurie and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
      "However, shortly after that report, Mr. Trump announced that he had called off the plan to \"surge\" federal agents to San Francisco following a conversation with Lurie.",
      "\"I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around,\" the president wrote in a Truth Social post on Oct. 23. The president also noted that \"friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge.\"",
      "\"I told him what I would tell you,\" Lurie said Friday of his October call with Mr. Trump. \"San Francisco is a city on the rise, crime is at historic lows, all economic indicators are on the right direction, and our local law enforcement is doing an incredible job.\"",
      "Going back to the pandemic, San Francisco has often been the strong focus of criticism from Republican lawmakers over its struggles in combatting crime and homelessness. It was voter frustration over those issues that helped Lurie defeat incumbent London Breed in November 2024.",

    "summary": "Prosecutors in the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division were told they will not play a role in the investigation into a fatal shooting of a Minnesota woman by an ICE officer, two sources said.",
    "story": [
      "Prosecutors in the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division were told they will not play a role in the ongoing investigation into a fatal shooting of a woman in Minneapolis by a federal immigration officer, according to two sources familiar with the matter.",
      "Leadership in the Civil Rights Division, overseen by Harmeet Dhillon, informed staff in the division's criminal section that there would not be an investigation, two sources said. Normally, after a high-profile incident involving a fatal shooting by an officer, attorneys from the criminal section fly out to the scene. Multiple career prosecutors offered to do so in this case, but they were told not to do so, one of the sources added.",
      "While investigations into the excessive use of force can be pursued solely by a U.S. Attorney's office without direct involvement from the Civil Rights Division, it is customary for the division's federal prosecutors to take the lead on high-profile investigations like the one in Minnesota.",
      "The decision also raises questions about how far the FBI's investigation into the shooting will go.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment.",
      "On Thursday, the Justice Department announced that the FBI was leading the investigation into the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer.",
      "Video footage shows the officer, identified in court records from a prior incident as Jonathan Ross, fired three rounds at the car as Good started to drive away.",
      "The video also appeared to depict the officers did not take immediate steps to ensure that Good received emergency medical care after the shooting took place. A separate video from the scene showed officers stopping a man who claimed to be a doctor from moving toward Good.",
      "The killing has sparked protests nationwide, including in New York, Miami, Los Angeles and Detroit.",
      "Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has argued that Ross was acting in self-defense, and claimed that Good was trying to use her car as a weapon in an act of \"domestic terrorism.\"",
      "That description sparked immediate backlash from state and city officials, with the mayor of Minneapolis labeling the self-defense claims as \"bulls***.\"",
      "On Friday, Trump administration officials shared another cellphone video of the incident that sources say was recorded by the ICE officer. The White House argues this video shows Ross was hit by Good's car.",
      "The Justice Department has stopped short of claiming Ross was acting in self-defense.",
      "But in a statement to CBS News this week, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said that the use of deadly force by law enforcement officials can sometimes be justified.",
      "\"Federal agents risk their lives each day to safeguard our communities. They must make decisions, under dynamic and chaotic circumstances, in less time than it took to read this sentence,\" Blanche said.",
      "\"The law does not require police to gamble with their lives in the face of a serious threat of harm. Rather, they may use deadly force when they face an immediate threat of significant physical harm,\" he added.",
      "The criminal section of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division specializes in investigating and prosecuting constitutional violations by law enforcement officers.",
      "Some of the most common investigations involve excessive use of force, but can also include other things such as sexual misconduct, false arrests or deliberate indifference to serious medical needs.",
      "One of the most famous civil rights prosecutions by the section in recent years took place in Minneapolis, after former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd in May 2020.",
      "Chauvin pleaded guilty to willfully depriving, while acting under color of law, Floyd's constitutional rights, as well as the rights of a 14-year-old boy.",
      "Since President Trump took office last year, the Civil Rights Division has scaled back its work on excessive force prosecutions, according to legal experts.",
      "Last year, it sought to downplay the conviction of a former Louisville police officer who was convicted of violating Breonna Taylor's civil rights and asked a federal judge to sentence him to serve just one day in prison.",
      "The judge ultimately sentenced him to serve 33 months.",

      "A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Department of Health and Human Services from halting around $10 billion in social services funding to multiple Democratic states, a move the agency argued was necessary to crack down on fraud \u2014 but the states called unconstitutional.",
      "The states covered by the decision are California, New York, Minnesota, Illinois and Colorado.",
      "HHS announced plans to freeze the funding earlier this week. The move would cut off some $7 billion from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, $2.4 billion from the Child Care Development Fund and $870 million in social services grants.",
      "U.S. District Judge Arun Submaranian on Friday granted a request by the states for a temporary restraining order halting the funding freeze. The order will last for 14 days, while the court considers a request for a longer-term order.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House and HHS For comment.",
      "The funding freeze came as the Trump administration alleged pervasive fraud in social programs run by Democratic states \u2014 an issue that was vaulted into national prominence by revelations that hundreds of millions of dollars were bilked from child nutrition, housing and autism programs in Minnesota.",
      "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told CBS News earlier this week the impacted states \"are not affected because they're Democratic,\" but because they allegedly \"refuse to cooperate with developing plans that would end the fraud.\"",
      "Kennedy said the impacted states were given warnings before their funding was frozen, but \"if you won't show us a plan, a workable plan, we're gonna cut it off until you do.\"",
      "\"The best way to help poor families is to end the fraud so that the money that is available for them. And that's what we're doing,\" Kennedy said.",
      "In a lawsuit against HHS filed in Manhattan federal court, the five states argued the Trump administration's focus on fraud was merely a \"pretext\" to punish Democratic states that are \"disfavored by the Administration.\" They also called the funding freezes an \"extraordinary and cruel\" move that would hamper programs used by needy children and families.",
      "The states alleged that the funding freeze is illegal and unconstitutional. They argued that the federal government can't cut off funding based on \"mere allegations or suspicion of fraud\" without following a legal process that gives states an opportunity to respond to HHS's concerns and appeal the agency's decisions.",
      "Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said in a statement Friday he was \"pleased with the court's decision.\"",

      "Denmark's former ambassador to NATO, veteran diplomat Michael Zilmer-Johns, had tough words for the Trump administration as Danish and American officials prepare to discuss the future of the small European nation's semi-autonomous territory of Greenland.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said he'll meet Danish officials next week, but he has not specified where or when. While Zlimer-Johns was critical of the Trump administration's stated intention to make the world's largest, strategically located island part of the U.S., he spoke pragmatically and hopefully about the future of the U.S.-Denmark relationship, and the future of the transatlantic NATO alliance that the U.S. has led for decades.",
      "Below are the highlights of CBS News' interview with the Danish diplomat.",
      "CBS News: About all this talk from the White House about taking Greenland, how do you feel?",
      "Michael Zilmer-Johns: Well, I was shocked, like I think almost every Dane and every Greenlander,, because the U.S. has, in our view, everything it needs for its security in Greenland. There's a huge base there. It has the potential to build up. We have a defense agreement specifically about Greenland, with the US dating back to the year 1951.",
      "I'm angry because I think that this is an affront to an ally that has stood up with the U.S. in Afghanistan, in Iraq, all over the world. Wherever they asked us to participate, we did. So I think it's totally ungrateful.",
      "CBS News: The Prime Minister, Mette Frederiksen, warned if Trump attacked Denmark to take Greenland, it would be the end of NATO. In her words, \"everything stops, including NATO, and thus the security that has been established since the end of the Second World War.\" As Denmark's former top representative to NATO, to what extent do you fear the end of NATO?\"",
      "Zilmer-Johns: I'm worried, but I am still confident that at the end of the day, better counsels will prevail, that we will find some kind of agreement with the Trump administration on Greenland so that NATO can continue as it should. It will be a very different NATO, anyhow, because it's clear that the Americans are withdrawing from Europe and Europe is going to step up. So it will be more European NATO in the future. But hopefully we can keep it together.\"",
      "CBS News: There has been criticism that a potential U.S. use of military force would basically be a NATO member against another NATO member in the nearly 80 years of the existence of this alliance. In your opinion, would the use of U.S. military force trigger Article 5, (my addition: the mutual defense clause that states an attack on one member is an attack on all 32 NATO nations)?",
      "Zilmer-Johns: I mean it's of course absurd to have such a situation where two NATO countries would be in a military conflict. If it was an outside power that did this to Denmark, then of course that would trigger Article 5. In a situation where it's the strongest member of NATO that would attack small Denmark, I think that this would be something where NATO could not engage because it's a conflict inside NATO and not between NATO and the foreign power.",
      "I still find it very difficult to imagine that we would see actual fighting between Danish soldiers and Americans. But of course, the Danish soldiers in Greenland have a standing order to defend the territory against any aggression.",
      "But should it happen, then at the end of the day, I think that the Danish government would tell the Danish troops to stand down because, of course, a military conflict between the world's greatest military power and small Denmark, that is an inevitable result.",
      "CBS News: Would an independent Greenland be able to defend itself against security issues, strategic adversaries? Here, China, Russia, as the White House, as President Trump has said?\"",
      "Zilmer-Johns: Greenland has a population of 60,000 people. It's a huge land mass, the size of most of Western Europe, so of course it could not do that alone. It would need a stronger partner. It could be Denmark, it could be the US, but the Greenlanders themselves have said that if they - and when they should - become independent, they will continue to be a member of NATO.",
      "CBS News: Right after World War II, the United States offered roughly $100 million in gold to buy Greenland from Denmark at that time. Right now, with inflation, that goes up to about $12-13 billion. What do you feel about that number as applied to Greenland in terms of its value?",
      "Zilmer-Johns: I think the whole principle of selling Greenland is out of the question. That's the thing that could happen in a different age where there were a lot of colonial powers and Greenland was a colony at that time and there were British colonies all over Africa. And we had sold the West Indies Islands to the Americans in 1916. So at that stage, it was not something that would be inconceivable. But today, with the status that Greenland has, it is simply not on the table. So whatever the amount would be, it would never be realistic, or something that anybody in Greenland could imagine.",
      "CBS News: Is the White House being imperial in its ambitions?",
      "Zilmer-Johns: I think that you could put it that way. When you look at the new security strategy, when you look what President Trump is saying about the Western Hemisphere and the need for control and the needs to expand the U.S., that sounds very much like imperialism in my eye.",
      "Traditionally, America was at the forefront of decolonization and making the Europeans give up their colonies, forcing them to do so or putting pressure to do. I do not think that this approach will continue after President Trump. Even if his MAGA movement or the Republicans should continue to control the White House. I think it's very much Trump's personal approach, this anachronistic approach of colonialism, more imperialism.",
      "CBS News: Is there anything else you would like to add in any talking points? A message for President Trump, a message for Americans?",
      "Zilmer-Johns: I would like to say that we are ready to cooperate with America in all aspects of ensuring the legitimate security interests in and around Greenland. And we would invite you to do so. Thank you very much.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Former special counsel Jack Smith is expected to testify publicly in front of the House Judiciary Committee as soon as this month.",
      "GOP Rep. Jim Jordan, the committee's chairman, told Politico on Friday that he would invite Smith to testify in the coming weeks. A source familiar with the planning confirmed that timeline to CBS News.",
      "Last month, Smith testified in a closed-door deposition for roughly nine hours on Capitol Hill before the committee, which is probing Smith's actions during his time as special counsel in the Biden administration.",
      "The committee is investigating what it claims were the \"politically motivated\" prosecutions of President Trump that Smith oversaw. Republicans on the committee have ramped up their criticism of investigative steps Smith and his office took, including their move to obtain phone records of sitting Republican lawmakers.",
      "Smith's two investigations into Mr. Trump resulted in more than 40 federal charges. The first alleged he unlawfully held onto government documents marked classified after leaving the White House in 2021, and the second stemmed from his alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election. Both cases were brought to an end after Mr. Trump won a second term in November 2024.",
      "The committee released a transcript and video of Smith's closed-door testimony last month. The former special counsel defended his prosecutions of Mr. Trump and said he was confident that he had enough evidence to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. Smith also rejected suggestions that he brought the cases against Mr. Trump to harm his 2024 presidential campaign, and said the Biden White House was not involved in his investigations.",
      "\"The evidence here made clear that President Trump was by a large measure the most culpable and most responsible person in this conspiracy,\" he said, referring to the 2020 election case. \"These crimes were committed for his benefit. The attack that happened at the Capitol, part of this case, does not happen without him. The other co-conspirators were doing this for his benefit.\"",
      "Smith also revealed that his team determined they had evidence to charge some of Mr. Trump's co-conspirators in the election interference case, but said he had not yet made a final decision to do so.",
      "Lanny Breuer, one of Smith's attorneys, said in a statement that his client \"has been clear for months he is ready and willing to answer questions in a public hearing about his investigations into President Trump's alleged unlawful efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his mishandling of classified documents.\"",
      "Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, welcomed news of Smith's public testimony.",
      "\"After Republicans forced Jack Smith into a backroom interrogation and rejected our calls for an open public hearing, now they decide they want a public hearing with Jack Smith after all,\" Raskin said in a statement. \"Their backroom strategy backfired in historic fashion.\"",
      "He added: \"This upcoming hearing is a win for truth-seeking Americans and yet another looming humiliation for Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans, who depend on a daily diet of lies to keep their Administration afloat.\"",
      "Smith had offered to testify publicly before the Senate and House Judiciary Committees, as prior special counsels have done, but Jordan, the House panel's chairman, issued a subpoena for Smith's initial testimony to be private.",
      "Lawyers for the former special counsel reiterated their request for Smith to answer questions from lawmakers in a public forum following his deposition.",

    "published": "Fri, 09 Jan 2026 11:22:20 -0500",
    "summary": "The White House ballroom architect said a new second story on the West Wing colonnade would help make the building more uniform with the ballroom.",
    "story": [
      "The White House disclosed Thursday that the White House ballroom project is expected to include plans to add a second story to the West Wing colonnade, a covered walkway that connects the West Wing to the White House residence.",
      "White House officials and the ballroom architect, Shalom Baranes, told members of the National Capital Planning Commission Thursday that adding a second story to the colonnade would help make the building more uniform with the new ballroom being built on the other side of the White House. It would also dramatically alter the iconic space outside the Oval Office.",
      "Baranes told the commission that the heights of the White House and ballroom \"will match exactly.\"",
      "Officials shared details of President Trump's planned ballroom at a public meeting of the planning commission charged with approving it. The White House also said it was not feasible to save the building's East Wing because of structural issues, past decay and other major concerns.",
      "White House officials offered the commission the most comprehensive explanation to date for the dramatic demolition of the East Wing in October to make way for a 90,000-square-foot ballroom. The demolition caused a public stir when it began in October with little advance notice, drawing criticism from Democrats and historic preservation groups.",
      "White House says it was more economical to tear down East Wing than to renovate it",
      "Josh Fisher, director of the White House Office of Administration, ticked off a list of problems in explaining why it was more economical to tear down the East Wing than to renovate it, saying that there were \"significant deficiencies and overall poor structural design and construction.\"",
      "\"The colonnade was structurally unstable. The roof systems had exceeded their service life, and the underpinnings were not sufficient to support the necessary upgrades,\" Fisher told members of the National Capital Planning Commission. \"In the East Wing, there was chronic water intrusion, accelerated deterioration and mold contamination. The electrical infrastructure was obsolete, deemed undersized and non-compliant with current code. Facilities were also non-compliant with both ADA and Secret Service requirements.\"",
      "\"Because of this and other factors, the cost analysis proved that demolition and reconstruction provided the lowest total cost ownership and most effective long-term strategy,\" Fisher continued.",
      "The project will include a new visitors' entry complex, which is intended to speed access to those coming to the White House to use the new ballroom and ensures they won't have to mill around under the tents or other temporary structures that are sometimes erected for large gatherings.",
      "Some of the 12 commission members raised concerns, particularly Commissioner Phil Mendelson, who asked if the planned size and location of the ballroom might change going forward. He was told that \"anything's possible\" but that the existing plans had been studied very thoroughly.",
      "Mendelson, who also serves as chairman of the D.C. Council, then asked if the planned ceiling height of 38 to 40 feet (11.5 to 12 meters) could still be lowered before the final structure is finished and received assurances that the number wasn't fully set.",
      "\"It still seems to me it's overwhelming the existing building,\" Mendelson said.",
      "Upon its completion, the ballroom is expected to be larger than the rest of the existing White House. Will Scharf, a top White House aide who has been tapped by Mr. Trump to head the commission, seemed to listen to the questions and concerns Mendelson raised.",
      "Mendelson also asked why the project hadn't been presented in its entirety to the commission before demolition of the East Wing began. Fisher said some things about the ballroom's construction were of a \"top secret nature.\" Scharf repeated his past assertions that the planning commission doesn't usually have jurisdiction over site work and demolition on any project, including those at the White House.",
      "He pointed to recent work at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum, which he said was an example of demolition beginning before the commission fully approved plans.",
      "Ballroom has prompted \"agitation\" from some quarters, White House acknowleges",
      "Scharf acknowledged that the ballroom project had prompted \"agitation\" from some quarters, saying it had sparked \"passionate comments on both sides\" while also noting that public comment wouldn't be part of Thursday's session.",
      "But commissioners were allowed to ask questions and give feedback, with a more formal review expected in the spring that would include public testimony and votes. The commission's next meeting is Feb. 5.",
      "After commissioner questions, Scharf defended the project, arguing that the White House needed a larger and more elegant space to hold visitors. He recalled visiting Windsor Castle last year with Mr. Trump, and noted that the president would eventually be hosting King Charles III of Great Britain.",
      "\"More likely than not, he will be hosted in a tent on the south lawn with porta-potties,\" Scharf said.",
      "Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Scharf said, \"Our concern is not so much about whether a ballroom is a good idea or not. I obviously believe that it is.\"",
      "\"Our concerns are how will that impact the public viewing experience, the visitor experience,\" he said. \"How will this new building interact with the other existing buildings in the area and more broadly in the city.\"",
      "The White House in December submitted its ballroom plans to the commission, which is one of two federal panels that review construction on federal land \u2014 usually before ground is broken.",
      "The National Trust for Historic Preservation has sued to halt construction of the $400 million ballroom, accusing the Trump administration of violating federal laws by proceeding before submitting the project for the independent reviews, congressional approval and public comment.",
      "A summary on the commission's website said the purpose of the project is to \"establish a permanent, secure event space within the White House grounds\" that provides increased capacity for official state functions, eliminates reliance on temporary tents and support facilities, and \"protects the historic integrity and cultural landscape of the White House and its grounds.\"",
      "A comprehensive design plan for the White House prepared in 2000 identified the \"need for expanded event space to address growing visitor demand and provide a venue suitable for significant events,\" the summary said. And it said successive administrations had \"recognized this need as an ongoing priority.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has been talking about building a White House ballroom for years. Last July, the White House announced a 90,000-square-foot (8,400-square-meter) space would be built on the east side of the complex to accommodate 650 seated guests at a then-estimated cost of $200 million. Trump has said it will be paid for with private donations, including from him.",
      "But he later increased the ballroom's capacity to 999 people and by October, had demolished the two-story East Wing of the White House to build it there. In December, he raised the price tag for the project to $400 million \u2014 twice the original estimate.",
      "The White House has announced few other details about the project but has said it would be completed before Mr. Trump's term ends in January 2029. The president has said the ballroom will be big enough for future presidential inaugurations to be held there and has also said it will have security features, such as bulletproof glass.",
      "While he was in Florida last week, the president bought marble and onyx for the ballroom \"at his own expense,\" the White House said. The cost was not disclosed.",

    "story": [
      "Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey indicated Thursday that the city is united in the wake of Wednesday's shooting of a 37-year-old woman by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in a residential neighborhood.",
      "\"What I appreciate about this situation right now is we in Minneapolis are all singing with one accord,\" Frey told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil. \"Which is, one, we're gonna stand up for our immigrant community. Two, we're gonna keep people safe. And three, we're not gonna take the bait.\"",
      "Frey said his first priority was \"to keep the people of Minneapolis safe.\"",
      "\"We know that the underlying intention of ICE is not safety, it's not reducing crime, what it is, is to cause chaos and disruption in our city,\" Frey said. \"Clearly they want to deploy additional military resources, and we're not gonna take the bait.\"",
      "According to Frey, the protests that have taken place since the killing of Renee Good do not mirror the violence that engulfed Minneapolis and other U.S. cities following the May 2020 murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police.",
      "\"If you've watched how a lot of these protests have carried out, this is not some repeat of what we saw in 2020,\" Frey said. \"What we see is people saying, 'Hey, hang on one second, ICE wants us to take the bait, they want us to screw up, do something wrong, and ultimately see even greater military presence in our city.'\"",
      "In an interview with CBS News on Wednesday, White House border czar Tom Homan said that he wanted ICE agents to be given access to local jails and prisons in order to apprehend undocumented immigrants, arguing that this would make the current situation safer.",
      "When pressed on whether he would consider opening up local jails, Frey said that \"the cities don't run the jail, the jails are under the purview of the sheriff,\" adding that mistrust exists between federal authorities and local residents and municipalities.",
      "This comes after Frey, in a news conference Wednesday, demanded that ICE \"get the f*** out of Minneapolis.\" The Trump administration\u00a0has surged\u00a0about 2,000 federal immigration agents to the Twin Cities area as part of both an immigration crackdown and in response to the\u00a0state's fraud scandal.",
      "\"There's not a lot of confidence in this federal administration that they are going to do the right thing, either by our immigrant community, or perhaps more importantly, under the Constitution of the United States,\" Frey said.",
      "The mayor said that the Obama administration built trust with \"mayors, chiefs and sheriffs around the country,\" something this White House has failed to do, he argued. Frey also took aim at claims from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who on Wednesday described Good's actions leading up to the shooting as an \"act of domestic terrorism.\"",

      "\"There was that kind of trust built in,\" Frey said of past administrations. \"Why? Because they didn't create these B.S. narratives that we're seeing already, exactly like this one, where something horrific takes place, they, from the get-go, say this is domestic terrorism.

    "summary": "Video from the scene, along with statements from witnesses and local officials, disputes the accounts of federal officials regarding the circumstances that led up to the fatal shooting of a 37-year-old woman.",
    "story": [
      "A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a 37-year-old woman Wednesday morning during an operation in Minneapolis, Minnesota.",
      "Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and President Trump described the shooting as self-defense, but the mayor and governor disputed that, citing videos from the scene.",
      "The shooting comes as the Trump administration\u00a0has deployed\u00a0about 2,000 federal immigration and investigative agents to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area as part of a crackdown on the\u00a0state's fraud scandal\u00a0and immigration.",
      "Here's more of what we've learned about the shooting so far.",
      "Woman who was shot, Renee Nicole Good, was a 37-year-old U.S. citizen",
      "The city of Minneapolis said police responded to a call reporting a shooting at about 9:30 a.m. local time in a south Minneapolis neighborhood and found that a woman in a vehicle had been shot in the head.",
      "Minneapolis firefighters rushed the woman to Hennepin County Medical Center, where she died, the city said.",
      "The woman who was killed was identified as 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, a mother of three who had recently moved to the area with her wife and 6-year-old son.",
      "The Associated Press\u00a0reports Good had just dropped the child off at school and was driving home with her wife when she encountered the ICE agents.",
      "She was a U.S. citizen, federal sources confirmed to CBS News. Minnesota city leaders said Good was a legal observer of federal actions in the city and wasn't a target for an ICE-related arrest.",
      "She grew up in Colorado Springs as one of five children, her father, Timothy Granger, told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil. He said she had recently moved to Minneapolis to restart her life after what he described as an awful stretch following the sudden death of her second husband.",
      "He described her as warm, witty, and with a bubbly personality, and as someone who always cared deeply about other people.",
      "CBS affiliate\u00a0KCTV\u00a0in Kansas City spoke to a former neighbor who knew Good when she lived there until 2024. She said Good lived there with her partner, their young son and their dogs, and had two older children who visited routinely. She said she didn't know the family well but called them \"lovely neighbors.\"",
      "Good graduated from Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, in December 2020 with an English degree, the school said.",
      "Feds say she was shot during \"targeted operations\" by ICE",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, said in a statement that the shooting occurred while ICE officers were conducting \"targeted operations.\"",
      "McLaughlin described the woman who was killed as one of several \"violent rioters\" who were \"blocking\" ICE officers.",
      "According to McLaughlin, the woman \"weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them.\"",
      "An ICE officer, \"fearing for his life,\" then \"fired defensive shots,\" McLaughlin said.",
      "In a news conference following the shooting, Noem described the driver's actions as an \"act of domestic terrorism.\"",
      "Noem alleged the ICE officers had gotten stuck in snow and \"were attempting to push out their vehicle\" when \"a woman attacked them and those surrounding them and attempted to run them over and ram them with her vehicle.\"",
      "In a post on Truth Social, also claiming that the shooting was self-defense, Mr. Trump alleged that the woman \"viciously ran over the ICE Officer\" before being shot. However, a video clip from a local newscast that Mr. Trump attached to the post showed no sign that an officer had been run over.",
      "Video, witness accounts and local and state officials challenge federal claims",
      "Statements from witnesses and local officials, who point to several videos of the encounter, dispute the accounts from federal officials of the circumstances that led up to the shooting.",
      "In a fiery news conference, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey contested McLaughlin's narrative that the shooting was an act of self-defense, calling the federal government's account \"bull****.\"",
      "\"Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly: that is bulls***,\" Frey said. \"This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.\"",
      "In another news conference, Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he had seen the video as well and also challenged the account of self-defense.",
      "\"Don't believe this propaganda machine,\" Walz said. \"The state will ensure there is a full, fair and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice.\"",
      "One video taken by a man at the scene and provided to CBS Minnesota shows the woman in a maroon Honda Pilot SUV blocking the street with her car. An ICE agent walks behind the car and circles around to the passenger side of the vehicle.",
      "In another angle, she can be seen apparently attempting to wave someone to go around her before two agents then park their silver pickup truck and get out, walking towards the Honda's driver-side door.",
      "In that video, one of the officers from the pickup truck can be heard telling the woman to \"get out of the f****** car\" as he approaches. He reaches for the Honda's door handle and the car starts moving in reverse. As the Honda is reversing, another agent moves in front of the vehicle from the opposite side. The Honda then starts to move forward, and the agent in front of the vehicle draws his weapon and fires into the Honda.",
      "That agent then moves to the side of the car, although it's unclear if he was hit or not, and fires two more shots as the car continues moving forward.",
      "The videos show the SUV driving off a bit further before crashing into another car down the street.",
      "Multiple witnesses reaffirmed what was seen in the videos and told CBS Minnesota that whistles had sounded to alert neighbors of ICE's presence at about 9:30 a.m.",
      "Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said the FBI and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension are jointly investigating the shooting.",
      "ICE officer part of specially trained tactical unit",
      "A senior DHS official confirmed to CBS News that the agent who opened fire was a member of ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) Special Response Team \u2014 a specially trained tactical unit within ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations.",
      "Noem said the officer was taken to the hospital after the shooting and has since been released.",
      "\"The very same officer who was attacked today had previously been dragged by an anti-ICE rioter who had rammed him with a car and drug him with a car back in June,\" Noem said. \"He sustained injuries at that time as well.\"",
      "According to court records and the suspect's defense attorney from that June 17, 2025 incident, the agent's name is Jonathan Ross.",
      "During that June incident, immigration officers in St. Paul were attempting to arrest a 39-year-old man previously convicted of sexually assaulting a minor, according to a senior DHS official.",
      "According to the official, the suspect refused to roll his window down or get out of his car, so the officer broke a rear window and reached inside the car to unlock the door. At that point, the suspect drove off, dragging the officer approximately 100 yards with his arm inside the car. The suspect was accelerating and weaving to try to shake the officer off. The officer twice fired a Taser in an unsuccessful attempt to stop him. He was eventually knocked free of the vehicle, and suffered significant lacerations that required 33 stitches, the official said. The suspect was later federally charged with assaulting a federal officer with a dangerous weapon.",
      "Court records show Ross has been working with ICE in Minnesota since at least 2017.",
      "Will the officer face charges or discipline?",
      "It was unclear if the officer would face any charges or discipline at the early stages of the investigation. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, however, criticized the Trump administration for allegedly\u00a0cutting state investigators out of the process.",
      "\"The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, the BCA, spent the day yesterday trying to get that accountability. We have learned that the Trump administration has now denied the state that ability to participate in the investigation,\" Walz said at a Thursday news conference.",
      "\"It feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome,\" he said of that decision, accusing Mr. Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Noem of making statements about the incident that are \"verifiably false.\"",
      "The BCA said in a statement it was initially invited to participate in the investigation but that the FBI later said it would be the sole lead and \"the BCA would no longer have access to the case materials, scene evidence or investigative interviews necessary to complete a thorough and independent investigation.\"",
      "\"Without complete access to the evidence, witnesses and information collected, we cannot meet the investigative standards that Minnesota law and the public demands. As a result, the BCA has reluctantly withdrawn from the investigation,\" the agency said.",
      "Noem, however, said Thursday, \"They have not been cut out. They don't have any jurisdiction in this investigation.\"",
      "\"This is an experienced officer who followed his training, and we will continue to let the investigation unfold into the individual and continue to follow the procedures and policies that happen in these use of force cases,\" she added.",
      "Shooting prompts local outrage",
      "Local residents took to the streets Wednesday and Thursday to protest the shooting and ICE's presence. Many attended a vigil for Good, creating an impromptu memorial where the shooting occurred. Local officials implored those demonstrating to remain peaceful.",
      "In his news conference Wednesday, Frey had a blunt message to federal immigration officers, \"get the f*** out of Minneapolis.\"",
      "\"They are not here to cause safety in this city. What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust,\" the mayor said.",
      "About 1,500 ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations agents and 650 Homeland Security Investigations agents have been deployed to the Twin Cities in recent weeks, CBS News has learned, an increase 15 times the normal ICE presence in the region.",
      "Walz in his Wednesday news conference said the state \"doesn't need any further help from the federal government.\"",
      "\"To Donald Trump and Kristi Noem, you've done enough,\" Walz said.",
      "The governor also directed the Minnesota National Guard to prepare in the event that it was need to assist state and local authorities amid the fallout from the shooting.",
      "Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota said in a statement that \"ICE must stop terrorizing our communities.\"",
      "Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Mr. Trump's decision to send thousands of federal agents to Minnesota is \"causing serious harm and spreading terror\" through the community.",
      "Minneapolis Public Schools announced late Wednesday that, \"out of an abundance of caution,\" classes would be canceled districtwide for all schools both Thursday and Friday \"due to safety concerns related to today's incidents around the city.\" All after-school activities and athletics would be canceled as well.",
      "Walz on Thursday demanded federal agents \"stay out of our schools.\"",

    "summary": "Greenland is 836,000 square miles of largely frozen ground northeast of Canada. So why does the White House say it \"should be part of the United States\"?",
    "story": [
      "Why does the United States want control of Greenland? President Trump has made it clear that he thinks the U.S. needs to control the Arctic island to ensure the security of America and its NATO allies, a point those allies \u2014 and Greenland \u2014 vehemently disagree with.",
      "But there's more at play here, including a valuable shipping route and access to mineral resources.",
      "Here's what interests the U.S. about the semi-autonomous Danish territory:",
      "\"It's so strategic right now\"",
      "Greenland spans about 836,000 square miles, much of it covered by the Greenland Ice Sheet. It's home to only around 60,000 people and is a semi-autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark with its own elected government.",
      "Its location between the U.S., Russia and Europe makes it strategic for both economic and defense purposes \u2014 especially as melting sea ice has opened up new shipping routes through the Arctic. It is also the location of the northernmost U.S. military base.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed the U.S. needs Greenland for national security purposes.",
      "\"It's so strategic right now,\" he told reporters on Sunday, Jan. 4. \"Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place ... We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it.\"",
      "\"The Americans have a strong interest in overseeing the activities of foreign countries in Greenland because it's such a big security asset for foreign states, and due to that, any investment or activity, from the American point of view, may be seen as a security threat,\" Frank Sejersen, associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, told CBS News earlier this year.",
      "Control over a new, valuable route for shipping",
      "Melting sea ice around Greenland has created more opportunity to use the Northern Sea route \u2014 allowing shippers to save millions of dollars in fuel by taking a shorter route between Europe and Asia that was long only passable in warmer months.",
      "A Russian commercial vessel, aided by an icebreaker, first traversed the route in the winter in February 2021.",
      "Greenland's underground resources",
      "Greenland has reserves of oil, natural gas and highly sought after mineral resources.",
      "Those mineral resources, which include rare earth elements, \"have only been lightly explored and developed,\" Jose W. Fernandez, the U.S. Department of State's undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, said at a Minerals Security Partnership event in Greenland in November 2024.",
      "Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite, according to a 2023 report assessing the island's resources. Both minerals are needed to produce batteries for electric vehicles and a wide array of other technologies.",
      "Currently, lithium production is dominated by Australia, Chile and China, while China produces about 65% of the world's graphite, the report noted.",
      "Greenland also has the potential to provide a significant amount of rare earth minerals such as Neodymium, which is used to make the magnets used in electric motors, the 2023 report said.",
      "China produces about 70% of rare earth elements, and demand for rare earth minerals continues to grow with technological advances and the rapid spread of consumer devices that require the resources.",
      "There are, however, significant hurdles to mining in Greenland, including environmental and cost issues.",
      "Most Greenlanders don't want to be American",
      "Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said Tuesday that his country wants good relations with the U.S. and did not \"think that there might be a takeover of the country overnight, and that is why we are insisting that we want good cooperation.\"",
      "A poll conducted a year ago showed that 85% of Greenlanders did not want to be part of the United States.",
      "\"He can't just take it like that,\" Daniel Rosing, a trainee electrician who said he was proud of being a Greenlander, told CBS News ahead of a visit last year to the island by Vice President JD Vance and his wife.",

    "summary": "Amid an indefinite wait for the full release of case files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, some lawmakers and Epstein survivors want the Justice Department's internal watchdog to investigate its handling of the files.",
    "story": [
      "Amid an indefinite wait for the full release of the case files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, some attention is shifting to a lesser-known \u2014 if not invisible \u2014 group of federal agents: The U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General.",
      "The Inspector General's office serves as an internal watchdog for the Justice Department. Its staff operate in obscurity in a set of small federal offices, some in communities far from Washington, D.C., including Atlanta, Tucson and Trenton. Its agents and investigators monitor for fraud, abuse and weaknesses inside the Justice Department.",
      "In a growing series of formal written requests, Epstein survivors, some members of Congress and Washington-based watchdog groups are asking the Inspector General's office to investigate if the Justice Department is mishandling its legal responsibility to release the Epstein files.",
      "The Trump administration and its Justice Department are under increasing scrutiny and pressure for their handling of the Epstein files.",
      "A federal law required the department to release its records on Epstein by Dec. 19, but government lawyers told a judge this week that only 1% of the files have been reviewed and released so far. The Justice Department released thousands of records\u00a0on Epstein in several tranches last month, but it says it needs more time to pore through millions of additional documents and redact survivors' names and other sensitive information.",
      "The Inspector General's office has a policy of not commenting on \u2014 or confirming \u2014 requests for investigation. CBS News has obtained copies of several requests for probes.",
      "In a formal request submitted Wednesday, ethics attorneys with the D.C.-based Democracy Defenders Fund asked the Inspector General to determine if the Justice Department had violated the law by redacting information improperly in the files, failing to justify its redactions or \"selectively releasing files for what appear to be partisan purposes.\"",
      "The Democracy Defenders Fund is represented by Norm Eisen, a former Obama administration ethics official who has been critical of Trump.",
      "\"Congress has directed that the Department of Justice provide answers. Instead, the Department has continued to deny, deflect, and delay,\" Eisen said.",
      "A group of Senate Democrats and Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska have also asked for a review. In a letter submitted Tuesday, the group said, \"A neutral assessment of its compliance with the statutory disclosure requirements is essential.\"",
      "One of the senators, Michigan Democratic Sen. Gary Peters, told CBS News, \"We want to make sure all the documents are actually being presented. Following the law it's always important to have checks on that.\"",
      "Before the Justice Department began releasing the files last month, a handful of Senate Democrats also requested a review to determine whether any of the records had been \"tampered\" with or concealed.",
      "The Office of Inspector General has a history of working on high-profile investigations involving the Justice Department's handling of sex crime allegations. In 2021, the office made headlines when its review of the FBI's probe into convicted sex offender Larry Nassar, a former U.S. Gymnastics doctor, found the bureau learned Nassar had been accused of molesting gymnasts in 2015, but failed to act, leaving him free to continue to target victims for months.",
      "The office has also waded into the Epstein issue, carrying out a 2023 investigation into Epstein's 2019 death by suicide while in federal custody. The probe found \"negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance failures\" by Federal Bureau of Prisons staff.",
      "A 2025 semiannual report by the Inspector General said the office received more than 8,000 tips and allegations in a six-month span in late 2024. Approximately 100 of those allegations led to formal investigations by the office. A spokesperson declined to comment to CBS News about the letters submitted seeking new investigations about the Epstein files.",
      "In a series of interviews with CBS News, attorneys for survivors of Epstein's sex offenses said they have also sought or supported an Inspector General review of how the Justice Department is handling its responsibilities to manage the files.",
      "The partial, initial release of Epstein case files last month revealed that an early 1996 tip to the FBI by Epstein survivor Maria Farmer was not sufficiently pursued. Jennifer Freeman, an attorney who represents Farmer, told CBS News the Inspector General's office should look into \"how this significant failure took place.\"",
      "She said the office should also \"examine whether all Epstein-related files have been produced and are properly redacted, making sure victim-identifying information is not disclosed, and those federal employees who failed to address Maria's 1996 report are held accountable.\"",
      "Florida-based civil attorney Spencer Kuvin, who represents Epstein survivors, told CBS News victims of Epstein's offenses \"want full transparency and an opportunity to talk with the Federal Government about what they want, and do not want, released.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 06:53:37 -0500",
    "summary": "Fossilized bones and teeth dating to 773,000 years ago are providing a deeper understanding of the emergence of Homo sapiens.",
    "story": [
      "Where did our species first emerge? Fossils discovered in Morocco dating back more than 773,000 years bolster the theory that Homo sapiens originally appeared in Africa, scientists said in a study Wednesday.",
      "The oldest Homo sapien fossils, dating from over 300,000 years ago, were found at the Jebel Irhoud northwest of Marrakesh.",
      "Our cousins the Neanderthals\u00a0mostly lived in Europe, while more recent additions to the family, the Denisovans, roamed Asia.",
      "This has prompted an enduring mystery: who was the last common ancestor of Homo sapiens and our cousins, before the family tree split off into different branches?",
      "This divergence is thought to have occurred between 550,000 and 750,000 years ago.",
      "Until now, the main hominin fossils from around that time period were found in Atapuerca, Spain.",
      "They belonged to a species dubbed \"Homo antecessor,\" dated back around 800,000 years ago, and had features that were a mix of the older Homo erectus and those more similar to Homo sapiens and our cousins.",
      "This sparked a contentious debate about whether our species originally emerged outside of Africa, before returning there.",
      "There was \"a gap in the fossil record of Africa,\" French paleoanthropologist and lead study author Jean-Jacques Hublin told AFP.",
      "The research published in the journal Nature fills that gap by finally establishing a firm date for fossils discovered in 1969 inside a cave in the Moroccan city of Casablanca.",
      "Over three decades, a French-Moroccan team unearthed hominin vertebrae, teeth and fragments of jaws that have puzzled researchers.",
      "Researchers said a thigh bone found in the cave had bite marks suggesting the person may have been killed or scavenged by a predator, the Reuters news agency reported.",
      "\"Only the femur displays clear evidence of carnivore modification - gnawing and tooth marks - indicating consumption by a large carnivore,\" Hublin told Reuters. \"However, the cave appears primarily to have been a carnivore den that hominins used only occasionally. The absence of tooth marks on the mandibles does not imply that other parts of the bodies were not consumed by hyenas or other carnivores.\"",
      "A slender lower jawbone discovered in 2008 proved particularly perplexing.",
      "\"Hominins who lived half a million or a million years generally didn't have small jawbones,\" Hublin said.",
      "\"We could clearly see that it was something unusual -- and we wondered how old it could be.\"",
      "However numerous efforts to determine its age fell short.",
      "When Earth's magnetic field flipped",
      "Then the researchers tried a different approach.",
      "Every once in a while, Earth's magnetic field flips. Until the last reversal -- 773,000 years ago -- our planet's magnetic north pole was near the geographic south pole.",
      "Evidence of this change is still preserved in rocks around the world.",
      "The Casablanca fossils were discovered in layers corresponding to the time of this reversal, allowing scientists to establish a \"very, very precise\" date, Hublin said.",
      "This discovery eliminates the \"absence of plausible ancestors\" for Homo sapiens in Africa, he added.",
      "Antonio Rosas, a researcher at Spain's National Museum of Natural Sciences, said it adds \"weight to the increasingly prevalent idea\" that the origins of both our species and the last common ancestor of Homo sapiens and Neanderthals/Denisovans lie in Africa.",
      "\"This work also suggests that the evolutionary divergence of the H. sapiens lineage might have started earlier than is conventionally assumed,\" Rosas, who was not involved in the research, commented in Nature.",
      "Like Homo antecessor, the Casablanca fossils have a mix of characteristics from Homo erectus, ourselves and our cousins.",
      "But while clearly closely related, the Moroccan and Spanish fossils are not the same, which Hublin said is a sign of \"populations that are in the process of separating and differentiating.\"",
      "The Middle East is considered to have been the main migration route for hominins out of Africa, however sinking sea levels at certain times could have allowed crossings between Tunisia and Sicily -- or across the Strait of Gibraltar.",
      "So the Casablanca fossils are \"another piece of evidence to support the hypothesis of possible exchanges\" between North Africa and southwestern Europe, Hublin said.",
      "The study was published just weeks after scientists said newly discovered fossils prove that a mysterious foot found in Ethiopia belongs to a little-known, recently named ancient human relative who lived alongside the species of the famous Lucy.",

      "\"Yesterday, January 7, a single crew member on board the station experienced a medical situation and is now stable,\" NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said during a news conference.",
      "\"After discussions with Chief Health and Medical Officer Dr. J.D. Polk and leadership across the agency, I've come to the decision that it's in the best interest of our astronauts to return Crew 11 ahead of their planned departure (in mid February). ... We expect to provide a further update within the next 48 hours as to the expected, anticipated undock and re-entry timeline.\"",
      "In keeping with the agency's strict medical privacy policy, NASA officials have not identified the astronaut in question or provided any details about the nature of the medical issue.",
      "But the ailing astronaut is a member of NASA's Crew 11, made up of commander Zena Cardman, veteran astronaut Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov.",
      "They were launched to the International Space Station on Aug. 1 aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon ferry ship. They were planning to return to Earth around Feb. 20, after their Crew 12 replacements arrive.",
      "Fincke and Cardman were planning to venture outside the space station on Thursday to complete a support truss for an add-on solar array and to carry out a variety of other tasks.",
      "But on Wednesday, NASA announced the spacewalk had been called off due to a \"medical concern\" with one of the Crew 11 astronauts. The agency said the crew member was \"stable,\" but no other details were provided.",
      "Polk said Thursday that the astronaut in question was not injured or made ill by any operational aspect of living aboard the space station, adding that spacewalk preparations played no role in the incident.",
      "Isaacman said the planned early return of Crew 11 did not represent an \"emergency,\" adding the agency was simply erring on the side of caution to ensure the health and well-being of the astronaut. Even so, Crew 11's early return will mark the first time in U.S. space history that a mission has been cut short due to a medical issue.",
      "Polk agreed it was not an emergency, adding \"This is not an injury that occurred in the pursuit of operations, but unrelated to the operational environment that we have right now. It's mostly having a medical issue in the difficult areas of microgravity and with the suite of hardware that we have at our disposal available to complete a diagnosis.\"",
      "Space station crews have extensive medical equipment on board and crew members are trained to serve as medical officers.",
      "Physician and former astronaut Tom Marshburn told CBS News that space station crews are \"equipped to deal with all the things that have happened in space over the 65 years of human spaceflight, any of those things that come up. Even to the some extreme examples, like a heart attack, something like that. We have the tools to do it.",
      "\"We just can't sustain somebody sick for a really long period of time, just for a few days, perhaps. But pretty much any medical event that you can imagine ... could happen up there, yeah.\"",
      "Amit Kshatriya, NASA's associate administrator, said Crew 11 will follow normal procedures when returning to Earth where they will splash down in the Pacific Ocean off the Southern California coast. SpaceX support crews and NASA flight surgeons will be standing by aboard the company's Crew Dragon recovery ship. The crew will be flown to shore by helicopter and then fly by jet back to the Johnson Space Center.",
      "\"As Dr. Polk mentioned, it's the first time we've done a controlled medical evacuation from the vehicle, so that is unusual,\" Kshatriya said. \"What's important to us is the whole crew, and we don't want to do anything, given the nature of the condition, that we put any other additional risk on the crew by diverging from our normal processes. So that's why we're doing essentially a controlled expedited return.\"",
      "The space station is continuously staffed by a crew of seven. Three launch and return to Earth aboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft and four fly to and from the lab aboard NASA-managed SpaceX Crew Dragon ferry ships.",
      "Both spacecraft serve as lifeboats during a crew's long-duration space station stay. If a Soyuz or Crew Dragon flier gets sick or is seriously injured aboard the station, that person is joined by all of his or her crewmates for the flight back to Earth.",
      "Because of the ever-present chance that a Soyuz or Crew Dragon might have to depart early, NASA and Roscosmos, the Russian federal space agency, agreed to fly one NASA astronaut aboard each Soyuz and one Russian cosmonaut aboard each Crew Dragon.",
      "The seat-swap arrangement ensures that at least one Russian and one American are always on board the station to operate equipment in their respective modules should one spacecraft depart early and take all its crew members with it.",
      "For that reason, after Crew 11 undocks from the station, NASA will still have one astronaut \u2014 Chris Williams \u2014   aboard to operate systems in the lab's U.S. modules. He was launched to the outpost in November aboard a Soyuz spacecraft along with two Russian crewmates.",
      "A one-time volunteer firefighter and emergency medical technician with a Ph.D. in astrophysics from MIT, Williams was a board-certified medical physicist at Harvard Medical School when selected to join NASA's astronaut corps in 2021.",
      "With the departure of Crew 11, Williams would be on his own managing the U.S. segment of the space station until Crew 12 arrives in February.",
      "Crew 12 commander Jessica Meir, a space station veteran, rookies Jack Hathaway and European Space Agency astronaut Sophie Adenot and veteran cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev are scheduled for launch Feb. 15.",
      "NASA and SpaceX are looking into moving that launch up a few days amid work to ready a Space Launch System rocket for takeoff as early as Feb. 6 to send four astronauts on a looping fight around the moon.",
      "The high-profile Artemis 2 mission will be the first to send astronauts to the vicinity of the moon in more than 50 years. Isaacman said he did not think the early return of Crew 11 and the possibly early launch of Crew 12 would have any impact on the moon mission.",

      "Cloud 9 was identified three years ago, but it wasn't until recently that the Hubble Space Telescope could be used to confirm there were no stars inside. Alejandro Benitez-Llambay, an assistant professor at Italy's Milano-Bicocca University and the principal investigator on the Hubble team, said that Cloud-9 tells the \"tale of a failed galaxy.\"",
      "\"In science, we usually learn more from the failures than from the successes,\" Benitez-Llambay said. \"In this case, seeing no stars is what proves the theory right. It tells us that we have found in the local universe a primordial building block of a galaxy that hasn't formed.\"",
      "The core of Cloud-9 is made up of neutral hydrogen. It is about 4,900 light-years in diameter, NASA said. The hydrogen is estimated to measure one million times the mass of the sun.",
      "Cloud-9 also includes a huge amount of dark matter -- about five billion solar masses worth, NASA said. Andrew Fox, a member of the team who studied the object, called it a \"window into the dark universe.\"",
      "\"We know from theory that most of the mass in the universe is expected to be dark matter, but it's difficult to detect this dark material because it doesn't emit light,\" said Fox. \"Cloud-9 gives us a rare look at a dark-matter-dominated cloud.\"",
      "NASA said the cloud also \"suggests the existence of many other small, dark matter-dominated structures in the universe.\" Those kind of objects can be hard to study, because nearby bright features like stars and galaxies outshine them. Researchers also typically focus their attention on those brighter structures, NASA said. Because those items are hard to study, the findings from Cloud-9 help provide new insights, NASA said.",
      "Cloud-9 is the ninth gas cloud identified on the outskirts of the nearby spiral galaxy Messier 94, NASA said. Cloud-9 is smaller, more compact and highly spherical compared to those other clouds. It also appears to have a \"physical association\" with Messier 94, NASA said.",
      "Astronomers will conduct further surveys into Cloud-9 to learn more about dark matter, failed galaxies and the early universe itself, NASA said. They will also search for other similar objects.",
      "\"Among our galactic neighbors, there might be a few abandoned houses out there,\" said researcher Rachael Beaton, of the Space Telescope Science Institute.",
      "Cloud-9 may continue to change and could even grow into a galaxy if it continues to expand, NASA said.",

    "story": [
      "Meta has cut a trio of deals to power its artificial intelligence data centers, securing enough energy to light up the equivalent of about 5 million homes.",
      "The parent company of Facebook on Friday announced agreements with TerraPower, Oklo and Vistra for nuclear power for its Prometheus AI data center that is being built in New Albany, Ohio. Meta announced Prometheus, which will be a 1-gigawatt cluster spanning across multiple data center buildings, in July. It's anticipated to come online this year.",
      "Financial terms of the deals with TerraPower, Oklo and Vistra were not disclosed.",
      "The Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta said in a statement on Friday that the three deals will support up to 6.6 gigawatts of new and existing clean energy by 2035. A single gigawatt, according to a general industry standard for utilities, can power about 750,000 homes.",
      "\"These projects add reliable and firm power to the grid, reinforce America's nuclear supply chain, and support new and existing jobs to build and operate American power plants,\" the company said.",
      "Meta said its agreement with TerraPower will provide funding that supports the development of two new Natrium units capable of generating up to 690 megawatts of firm power with delivery as early as 2032. The deal also provides Meta with rights for energy from up to six other Natrium units capable of producing 2.1 gigawatts and targeted for delivery by 2035.",
      "Meta will also buy more than 2.1 gigawatts of energy from two operating Vistra nuclear power plants in Ohio, in addition to the energy from expansions at the two Ohio plants and a third Vistra plant, Beaver Valley, near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.",
      "The deal with Oklo, which counts OpenAI's Sam Altman as one of its largest investors, will help to develop a 1.2 gigawatt power campus in Pike County, Ohio, to support Meta's data centers in the region.",
      "The nuclear power agreements come after Meta announced in June that it reached a 20-year deal with Constellation Energy to secure power from its nuclear plant in Clinton, Illinois.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014 U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Thursday that he wants \"all options to be on the table,\" including a potential ban on Elon Musk's X platform in Britain, over the use of its artificial intelligence tool Grok to generate sexualized images of people without their consent.",
      "Starmer's remarks come as Musk's platform faces scrutiny from regulators across the globe over Grok's image editing tool, which has allowed users to create digitally altered, sexualized photos of real people,\u00a0including minors.",
      "\"This is disgraceful, it's disgusting and it's not to be tolerated. X has got to get a grip of this,\" Starmer said in an interview with a U.K. radio station. \"It's unlawful. We're not going to tolerate it. I've asked for all options to be on the table.\"",
      "A source in Starmer's office reiterated to CBS News on Friday that \"nothing is off the table\" when it comes to regulating X in Britain.",
      "CBS News has verified that Grok fulfilled user requests asking it to edit images of women to show them in bikinis or little clothing, including prominent public figures such as\u00a0first lady Melania Trump.",
      "Last week, Grok, a chatbot developed by Musk's company xAI, acknowledged \"lapses in safeguards\" that allowed users to generate digitally altered, sexualized photos of minors.",
      "Grok told users that as of Friday, access to its image generation tool was limited \"to paying subscribers\" of its user verification service. Paying subscribers have to provide their credit card and personal details to the company, which could dissuade some people from using the service, especially if they had intended to use Grok's AI tool to create illegal images of minors.",
      "xAI responded to a CBS News request for comment to criticism of Grok's image generation tool and steps it had taken to limit access to it on Friday, by saying: \"Legacy media lies.\"",
      "Addressing reporters on Friday morning, a U.K. government spokesperson called the move to limit access to Grok's image editing tool to paying users \"insulting\" to victims of misogyny and sexual violence, saying it, \"simply turns an AI feature that allows the creation of unlawful images into a premium service.\"",
      "Under the U.K. Online Safety Act, sharing intimate images without consent on social media is a criminal offense, and social media companies are required to proactively remove such content, as well as prevent it from appearing in the first place.",
      "If they fail to do so, the companies can face hefty fines or, in last resort cases, face what would effectively be a ban by Britain's independent media regulator Ofcom. Ofcom can compel payment providers, advertisers and internet service providers to stop working with a site, preventing it from generating money or being accessed from the U.K.",
      "In a post shared Monday on its own X account, Ofcom said it was \"aware of serious concerns raised about a feature on Grok on X that produces undressed images of people and sexualised images of children.\"",
      "\"We have made urgent contact with X and xAI to understand what steps they have taken to comply with their legal duties to protect users in the UK. Based on their response we will undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation,\" Ofcom said.",
      "Musk's platform has faced scrutiny from governments around the world, including the European Union and the U.S. Congress, over Grok AI's digital alteration of real images.",
      "On Wednesday, Republican Senator Ted Cruz said in a post on X that \"many of the recent AI-generated posts are unacceptable and a clear violation of my legislation \u2014 now law \u2014 the\u00a0Take It Down Act, as well as X's terms and conditions.\"",
      "\"These unlawful images pose a serious threat to victims' privacy and dignity. They should be taken down and guardrails should be put in place,\" Cruz said, adding that he was encouraged by steps taken by X to remove unlawful images.",
      "On Thursday, Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, threatened to sanction the U.K. government if Starmer moved to ban X in the U.K.",
      "\"If Starmer is successful in banning @X in Britain, I will move forward with legislation that is currently being drafted to sanction not only Starmer, but Britain as a whole,\" Paulina Luna said in a post on her own X account.",

      "The advancements include helping users write messages, finding information buried in email inboxes and delivering daily to-do lists. Gmail's new AI features initially will only be available in English within the U.S. Some features will be accessible to all users free of charge, while others require G1 Ultra and Pro subscriptions.",

Yet the push comes amid mounting privacy concerns around the use of generative AI, including its potential access to personal information.",
      "Personalized writing aid",
      "With the new features, all Gmail users will have access to what Google calls a 'Help Me Write' tool, which assists users with their grammar and phrasing. The tech analyzes users' previous emails to better understand their writing style so it can personalize emails and make real-time suggestions on how to respond to a message.",
      "Gmail will also offer an AI Overview feature, which summarizes email exchanges and highlights key takeaways from longer threads.",
      "Both features will be available on the Web and mobile versions of Gmail.",
      "\"This is us delivering on Gmail proactively having your back,\" said Blake Barnes, a Google vice president of product.",
      "Google is offering paid Pro and Ultra subscribers access to technology that lets users ask natural-language questions directly in the Gmail search bar. Subscribers will also have access to a dedicated chatbot for follow-up questions.",
      "For example, instead of manually searching for last month's electric bill, a user could ask, \"How much was my electric bill last month?\" Gemini would scan the user's email history, highlight the information and provide direct access to any relevant messages.",
      "Another feature, \"AI Inbox,\" is also being rolled out to a handful of customers for testing. When it's turned on, the function will sift through inboxes and suggest to-do lists and topics that users might want to explore.",

      "How to opt out",
      "Incorporating AI directly into Gmail could pose risks for Google, given that large language models can sometimes present erroneous or misleading information. And although users can proofread AI-aided messages before they're sent, the tech could potentially make mistakes.",
      "Still, Gmail users can turn off the AI features. To do so, users should open their Gmail account settings and, under the \"General\" tab, scroll to the \"Smart\" features and personalization section. Users should then uncheck \"Turn on smart features in Gmail, Chat, and Meet,\" and then save their changes.",

      "Old videos and images from past events recirculated, purporting to show reactions to Maduro's capture and strikes in Caracas. One video showing people tearing down a billboard image of Maduro dates as far back as July 2024. Another video purporting to show a strike in Venezuela had circulated on social media as far back as June 2025.",
      "Another image showing a man with a sack over his head while sitting in the back of a car circulated widely, sparking online speculation as to whether the photo showed Maduro's capture. Many users flagged that the photo was probably not of Maduro, but as of this afternoon the post had 30,000 likes and over a thousand reposts. A Daily Mail article from 2023 reported that the photo shows Saddam Hussein after his capture, sitting with a Delta Force member, but CBS has not independently confirmed this.",

    "story": [
      "In January 2022, the pain coursing through Hannah Pettey's body for six months was hitting her harder than ever.",
      "Hannah Pettey: It was unbearable \u2026 I was in the bed at this point for probably like a week straight.",
      "Anne Marie Green: Were you even able to care for your kids?",
      "Hannah Pettey: I did as much as I could.",
      "Hannah's son Lincoln was 3, and her daughter Gracie had just turned 2. But Hannah was too sick to attend Gracie's birthday party.",
      "Hannah Pettey: I was so weak that I couldn't hardly walk. I had a little office chair that I would roll around in our house because I really didn't get out of the house \u2026",
      "Hannah says her husband Brian Mann was there when she needed him the most.",
      "Hannah Pettey: When I really started getting sick is when he was the sweetest to me \u2026",
      "Brian was a chiropractor, but he says he could not diagnose what was wrong with Hannah.",
      "Brian Mann: I had no idea \u2026 that's out of my forte. Um, that's someone that I would refer out, refer to a specialist, which is what I wanted to do.",
      "On Jan. 18, 2022, Hannah checked in with her mother Nicole Pettey. After they hung up, Nicole says she was haunted by something she heard in her daughter's voice.",
      "Nicole Pettey: Just know that feeling, I knew something was wrong.",
      "Nicole Pettey: I called and called and called and texted \u2026 Hannah called me finally \u2026 but she wasn't able to speak. \u2026 So she just kind of gasped \u2026 and then she'd asked me, she said, \"Mom, can you take me to the hospital?\"",
      "What was making Hannah Pettey sick?",
      "Brian was at work, so Nicole rushed over and drove Hannah to UAB, the hospital at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. While there, Nicole took several photos and videos.",
      "Nicole Pettey: The doctor \u2026 said, obviously she is very sick \u2026 I wanna keep her, but there's \u2026 no way that they're gonna let me keep her. Her, um, vitals are stable \u2026 I said \u2026 \"if you send her home, she's gonna die \u2026\"",
      "It was right then that Hannah suffered a terrifying seizure, and, in the frenzy, she ripped off her hospital gown. For Nicole, that moment is frozen in time.",
      "Nicole Pettey: \u2026 she was skin and bones \u2026 they told me that she was actually starving to death when we got there, they said she was, had hours to live \u2026",
      "One doctor directed her anger at Nicole.",
      "Nicole Pettey: She's like, does she live with you? Like obviously someone should have seen that this person was dying, you know. This person was starving to death. \u2026 She said, \"who is responsible for her?\"",
      "Anne-Marie Green: What'd you say?",
      "Nicole Pettey: And I said, she's married and they said, \"she's married?\"",
      "The seizure was so severe Hannah lost consciousness. Doctors wanted to talk with Hannah's husband, so Nicole says she texted Brian:",
      "\"Hey Brian, Hannah had a seizure about 2 hours ago. She still has not come to yet\u2026they said she could be out all day long, so I wanted to let you know if she's not texting you that is why\u2026\"",
      "Nicole Pettey: And I, of course, didn't get a response from him \u2026",
      "Anne-Marie Green: So you don't get \u2026 a text back \u2014 from Brian \u2026",
      "Nicole Pettey: No, never.",
      "It had been that way for years, she said; all through his marriage to Hannah, Brian ignored Nicole.",
      "Nicole Pettey: \u2026 never seen him the whole time they were married \u2026 never \u2026 any interaction with him whatsoever.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: Never for any family gatherings, any holidays, he just never came?",
      "Nicole Pettey: Never.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: Brian didn't like you.",
      "Nicole Pettey: No.",
      "That night, Brian never got back to Nicole, but he had learned about Hannah's condition from his mother, who was in touch with Nicole. He arranged for childcare and began driving.",
      "Nicole Pettey: He got to the hospital around 9:30 that night \u2026",
      "Under COVID restrictions, the hospital was allowing only one visitor at a time and with Nicole inside, Brian was kept out.",
      "Brian Mann: I was very irritated that Nicole was not switching out with me, um, letting me in, because I stood outside of that hospital for a long time, trying to get in that room with Hannah.",
      "But eventually, Nicole did come out and Brian was allowed in.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: It must have been shocking to see her in that hospital bed like that?",
      "Brian Mann: Yes \u2026 but I was glad that she was there \u2026 and \u2014 and people were trying to figure something out.",
      "When Mann left to go to work, Nicole went in. Hannah was still unconscious and had been that way for nearly 48 hours. Nurses had just finished checking on her when Nicole bent over her daughter.",
      "Nicole Pettey: I kissed her head, and I said, \"I love you\" \u2026 Her eyes just popped open. And then she said, \"I love you too.\"",
      "Nicole says nurses were amazed and rushed to her side.",
      "Nicole Pettey: I just started crying and Hannah said, \"have I not been talking?\"",
      "But Hannah's ordeal was far from over. Days after Hannah was admitted, Nicole says doctors put her in a medical coma while they drained the excess fluid from within her brain.",
      "Nicole Pettey: \u2026 and then they had to paralyze her because even being in a coma, um, there was just so much fluid in her brain that any type of movement \u2026 she would've died\u2026",
      "Anne-Marie Green: But, Nicole, it's like things are going from bad to worse.",
      "Nicole Pettey: Yeah, yeah.",
      "Anne Marie Green: Did you ever give up hope?",
      "Nicole Pettey: No. Oh no. No. Never. Not one time \u2026",
      "Brian says he was wondering why Hannah's health had gone downhill so quickly the day Nicole had picked her up and drove to the hospital.",
      "Brian Mann: \u2026 that is curious how bad she got from getting in the car with her mother to being admitted to the hospital.",
      "His dislike and distrust of Nicole boiled over.",
      "Brian Mann: \u2026 she is a cruel person \u2026 she was not happy with the fact that Hannah seemed happy being with me \u2026",
      "Hannah Pettey's body was \"packed with lead\"",
      "Eight days after Hannah was admitted to the hospital, her neurologist told Nicole that doctors had figured out what was causing Hannah's symptoms.",
      "Nicole Pettey: Her exact words were, \"she has an astronomical amount of lead inside of her.\"",
      "Lead. It was an unusual finding, and Nicole says doctors told her they had never seen a patient like Hannah.",
      "Nicole Pettey: They said her colon was so packed, full of lead \u2026 it was almost 100% lead. \u2026 there was no room in her stomach to hold anything. It was just complete lead plus there was lead just in her bones, just everywhere \u2026",
      "Doctors told Nicole there was no way Hannah could have ingested all that lead by accident \u2014 it had to be deliberate, and they told her exactly what they thought.",
      "Nicole Pettey: They let me know that this is an attempted murder \u2026",
      "The hospital reported Hannah's case to the Department of Human Resources, the state agency that protects vulnerable adults. Hospital administrators immediately put Hannah in a secluded room with someone at the door to keep all visitors out. Nicole says she and Brian were told to leave and were no longer allowed to see Hannah because they were considered possible suspects.",
      "Nicole Pettey: I was beside myself \u2026 because I had to leave her \u2026 they had to send me away from the hospital.",
      "Brian Mann: I immediately started thinking this is Nicole. \u2026 This has to be Nicole pointing fingers \u2026 I didn't really think it would get anywhere because I thought it was, again, just Nicole making waves to make waves.",
      "Brian Mann: Hannah's mom just caused so many problems and not so much directly at me, but she was just awful to Hannah \u2026",
      "Brian says Hannah told him that Nicole could be critical of her.",
      "Brian Mann: Why don't you put makeup on, um, are you sure you should eat that? Just stuff like that all the time.",
      "Brian Mann: I would say \u2026 why do you want this woman in your life? And it always all she could come back to, \"she's my mom.\" \u2026 \"She's my mom.\" And that's really the only defense she had for her, \"she's my mom.\"",
      "Hannah denies Brian's allegations. She did move away from Nicole and got her own apartment in June 2017, the month she turned 18 years old. She had just graduated from high school. That's when she met Brian, a 29-year-old chiropractor with his own business.",
      "Hannah Pettey: He was very, very sweet in the beginning and you know \u2026 he's very charming, good looking. (Laughs) And yeah, I really liked him.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: Sounds like it was almost sort of instant attraction.",
      "Brian Mann: Yes \u2026 it was head over heels. \u2026 umm everything was just working right.",
      "Within weeks of Brian's first date with Hannah, his friend Walker Snyder says Brian told him Hannah was \"the one.\"",
      "Walker Snyder: And I'm like, man, you just met her like a week ago or she's 18. (laughs) she doesn't know what she wants. \u2026 She doesn't even know what she doesn't want. And he was like, \"No, we both know what we want\" \u2026",
      "It wasn't long before Hannah told friends she was pregnant.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: How long were you guys dating \u2026 before you proposed?",
      "Brian Mann: We started dating in November. I believe I proposed after Valentine's Day \u2026 so not \u2014 not too long.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: Were you nervous?",
      "Brian Mann: I was \u2026 I take marriage very seriously. And, so, yeah \u2026 I was, I was definitely nervous about it.",
      "Hannah was nervous, too. She says she had noticed that Brian could be controlling but she plunged ahead \u2014 at least until her wedding day in May 2018. Hannah's friend, Alyson Holmes.",
      "Alyson Holmes: Right before we were all about to walk down the aisle \u2026 Hannah expressed to us that she was, you know \u2026 very nervous. She had cold feet \u2026",
      "Nicole Pettey: We told her a hundred times over. You don't have to do it. \u2026 if this is cold feet, you know, it is what it is. But if this is un \u2014 uncertainty, walk away, it's not too late to walk away.",
      "In the end, Hannah smiled through her ceremony, and married Brian.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: When you walked up to the altar and you looked at him, you had no questions?",
      "Hannah Pettey: I mean, I did. \u2026 I mean, deep down I did. I was like, I don't really know if I'm making the right decision and everything \u2026",
      "The couple moved into Brian's home and started their lives together.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: How was he as a husband?",
      "Hannah Pettey: For the most part, he was really good as a husband \u2026 I mean, it was good and bad.",
      "Hannah Pettey: We got in a lot of physical fights \u2026 so that's a bad thing, but it wasn't \u2026 all the time though, so \u2026",
      "Anne-Marie Green: You know, like, as I'm listening to you talk, you know, it sounds almost a little bit like \u2014",
      "Hannah Pettey: Mm.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: \u2014 you're explaining away \u2013",
      "Hannah Pettey: Mm-hmm.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: \u2014 the bad stuff. Do you think you did that in the marriage a bit?",
      "Hannah Pettey: Uh, yeah, I definitely did, I think \u2026Yeah. Yeah, my mom tells me that, too.",
      "Even their son's birth was a minefield of emotion.",
      "Hannah Pettey: You know, I was nine months pregnant, and I had started, um, bleeding. And so, I went to the hospital, and he came in and he got so angry at me \u2026 and he was yelling at me \u2026 and \"you shouldn't have been out walking like in this heat\" \u2026 like, \"that was so stupid and irresponsible\"",
      "Alyson Holmes: \u2026 he was acting so just outrageous that the nurses \u2026 even told her \u2026 if you need us to do something, then you say this specific word and we'll know \u2026 that we need to step in and intervene in what's going on \u2026",
      "Hannah never used that \"safe word\" but as time went on, Brian says the couple came to an understanding.",
      "Brian Mann: I would say, Hannah, talk to me. I am on your side\u2026. I'm your biggest fan, your biggest supporter \u2026 one day she said \u2026 \u00a0I'm going to trust you. And I want to do this with you. And I want to build this with you. \u2026 from then on, it just got better and better.",
      "Hannah Pettey: \u2026 that's when I started to really fall in love with him.",
      "The couple had another child, a daughter, and life was good, they say, until Hannah began to feel sick and went to the hospital emergency room in January 2022. She was left fighting for her life, and doctors were trying to help her, but they told Nicole they had to know more.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: They said the only way she gets this much lead in her system \u2014",
      "Nicole Pettey: Is to ingest it. Is to ingest it. They said she had to have ingested it.",
      "Nicole Pettey: I remember them saying, we don't care if you give her crack \u2026 we just want to know about it. We have to know everything she's taken.",
      "And that's when Nicole remembered something that she'd completely overlooked: Hannah told her that Brian had given her special supplements \u2013 capsules \u2014 each and every night.",
      "In search of evidence",
      "Doctors kept asking Nicole what Hannah had been eating in the months leading up to her hospital stay.",
      "Nicole Pettey: From what they can see, it looks like someone has gave her lead every single day for, at least \u2026 three months.",
      "Was Hannah eating something that contained lead? Nicole says she had no idea because she hardly ever visited her daughter in the months before the seizure. And never if Brian was home.",
      "Nicole Pettey: I could only go when he was working \u2026 and I would have to leave before he got off work. \u2026 I never actually ran into him.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: Whoa.",
      "Nicole Pettey: Yeah, He didn't come home until I left.",
      "As doctors pressed her for information, Nicole remembered Hannah telling her about special supplement capsules that Brian placed on her nightstand every night. Nicole says it didn't strike her as unusual because Brian was a chiropractor, but she told doctors anyway.",
      "Nicole Pettey: I told 'em that I know that they were big on supplements.",
      "Nicole says doctors repeatedly asked Brian to bring in the capsules described by Hannah, but he never did. Instead, he gave them a photo of common over-the-counter supplements.",
      "DHR investigators, who were getting information from Hannah's doctors, contacted Lt. Alan McDearmond of the Hartselle Police Department.",
      "Lt. Alan McDearmond: They said that I needed to go arrest somebody for attempting to kill their wife. And I'm like, well, hold up. I mean, we can't just go arrest people. What are you talking about?",
      "Investigators told McDearmond that doctors suspected Brian had given Hannah some type of lead-filled capsules over and over again.",
      "Lt. Alan McDearmond: \u2026 you can take a capsule and open it up, empty the contents and then put the lead in \u2026",
      "McDearmond told Brian about the hospital's allegations.",
      "Brian Mann: McDearmond \u2026 said \u2026 your wife's been lead poisoned. \u2026 And they think it was intentional. And they said, you're the number one suspect \u2026 So, I was kind of dumbfounded \u2026 I didn't know what to think about that.",
      "McDearmond asked Brian if the police could search his house, and he agreed.",
      "Brian Mann: So, I took him all through the house. I let him search my house \u2026 And we went through and tried to figure out what she was eating, pills, make-ups and \u2014 and things like that.",
      "McDearmond says Brian provided a bottle of supplements and a laxative that he said Hannah had taken.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: Hannah says you made her take supplements.",
      "Brian Mann: That is not true \u2026",
      "Brian blamed all his problems on Nicole.",
      "Brian Mann: I immediately started thinking this is Nicole \u2026This has to be Nicole pointing fingers.",
      "Investigators removed the children from Brian's home. They were placed with his parents. He had supervised visitation.",
      "Brian Mann: Nicole had just done so much over the years and Hannah had told me so much about her that I just had no doubt \u2026 Nicole was somehow stirring this all up.",
      "Brian said he remembered something Hannah had told him that now seemed to hold more significance. In second grade, in a story that Hannah confirms, she recalled being so sick for so long that she visited the school nurse dozens of times.",
      "Brian Mann: \u2026 and she eventually got really bad, and her mother took her to UAB. She says she remembers staying there about a week.",
      "Flash forward to 2022. Hannah was back at UAB Hospital. On January 29, McDearmond went to see Hannah for himself, but she was in a coma.",
      "Lt. Alan McDearmond: I had no idea the condition she was in until I went to the hospital and saw her for myself \u2026",
      "Doctors showed him Hannah's X-rays.",
      "Anne Marie Green: What did you think?",
      "Lt. Alan McDearmond: Oh, gosh, I was just floored. I mean, her whole insides was lit up from the \u2014 the lead reacting to the X-ray \u2026 I mean It was crazy.",
      "McDearmond asked Brian to come in.",
      "Lt. Alan McDearmond: And at that point is when he refused to further cooperate with the investigation.",
      "On February 1, McDearmond cleared Nicole, and she was once again allowed to visit Hannah.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: How were you able to clear Nicole?",
      "Lt. Alan McDearmond: You know, just through conversations \u2026 whether you could tell that she was very concerned about Hannah \u2026 she was the person that was caring for Hannah \u2026",
      "Anne-Marie Green: It sounds to me like you just like Nicole's behavior. She acted the way you expect a concerned mother to act. \u2026 And Brian didn't act the way you expected a concerned husband to act.",
      "Lt. Alan McDearmond: That's correct.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: Is that evidence?",
      "Lt. Alan McDearmond: That's not evidence. No \u2026 and the problem with this case was there was not a lot of evidence.",
      "Within days, McDearmond received the results of the tests done at Brian and Hannah's home.",
      "Lt. Alan McDearmond: Everything was negative.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: Did you ever find any capsules?",
      "Lt. Alan McDearmond: Um, no.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: Did you ever find any supplements that were tainted?",
      "Lt. Alan McDearmond: Um, no.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: Did you ever find evidence of lead being ground down or scraped, or turned into little particles that could go into a capsule?",
      "Lt. Alan McDearmond: No.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: So, isn't that kind of a big hole in the theory?",
      "Lt. Alan McDearmond: Well, he sold supplements.",
      "McDearmond says he kept looking for the source of that lead. In mid-February, Hannah began to rally and McDearmond went to see her again.",
      "Lt. Alan McDearmond: I told her in a very nice way, you know, why she was in the hospital and \u2026 asked her, you know, do you have any idea who may have given you some substance? She said, \"No.\"",
      "Lt. Alan McDearmond: Do you have any thoughts of self-harm? I mean, did you put yourself here? And she said, \"No.\"",
      "McDearmond said Hannah was coherent one minute and not the next. She said she saw \"people coming out of the walls.\"",
      "Lt. Alan McDearmond: When I first started talking to the medical staff, I mean, they didn't give her any hope \u2026 they said if she came out of this, that, uh, she would really not have any cognitive functions \u2026 they didn't suspect that, that we would be able to even talk with her.",
      "Anne Marie Green: Wow.",
      "Lt. Alan McDearmond: They basically told us that we needed to do everything that we could, because we didn't need to rely on her as a witness because they didn't think she would ever make it to that point.",
      "But Hannah surprised everyone by getting stronger each day with the help of a team of dedicated nurses.",
      "Nicole Pettey: They were all kind of close to her age \u2026 they knew she had kids, and they would say to her, \"you've got your babies, you've got your babies.\"",
      "Nicole Pettey: And I remember she just always got a life in her when you mentioned the kids. She was like \u2026 I'm gonna get better. I'm gonna get out here and get better, you know.",
      "Nicole says Hannah did get better and stronger \u2014 strong enough that Hannah's neurologist told her the whole story.",
      "Hannah Pettey: She grabbed my hand and she just kind of started giving me a heart to heart about why they have strong reasons to believe that it was Brian.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: And what's the conversation like after that, between you and Hannah?",
      "Nicole Pettey: Oh, it was horrible. That was horrible. Sorry, of everything that she went through, the heartbreak \u2026 The heartbreak was terrible \u2026 She just would sit there and cry.",
      "On March 3, after nearly two months, Hannah was well enough to leave the hospital. She went to her mom's house, reunited with her children, and filed for divorce. But friends like Kyle Golden were worried.",
      "Kyle Golden: We did know that Hannah was still in contact with Brian \u2014",
      "Alyson Holmes: Yeah.",
      "Kyle Golden: And that did upset us \u2026 It was scary.",
      "Alyson Holmes: Yeah.",

      "Despite the risks, Hannah had made up her mind to sit down with Brian face to face. Just one week after being discharged, she met him at their former home.",
      "Hannah Pettey: I just had to figure it out for myself. Instead of everyone telling me this is what happened.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: And so you sit down with him.",
      "Hannah Pettey: Mm-hmm.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: And did you ask him outright? Did you do this? Did you try to poison me?",
      "Hannah Pettey: No, I was so emotional. I mean I didn't stop crying that night. I remember I cried all through the night.",
      "Hannah Pettey: I wanted him to say \u2026 like there's no way that I could have, you know like what \u2026 or like, are you crazy? Like this is crazy \u2026 And I was expecting him to go out and say that to everybody. I don't care if he even made a Facebook post about it or just anything.",
      "Hannah says Brian never told her what she needed to hear. But then, incredibly, she changed her mind about the divorce.",
      "Hannah Pettey: I called my attorney. I was like, I don't want to go through with the divorce \u2026 like I don't think he did it. I said there must be something else.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: Hannah told you not to sign the divorce papers?",
      "Brian Mann: Yes.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: Because why?",
      "Brian Mann: Because she knew her mother had made up this whole thing and it was just another crazy Nicole episode.",
      "When Hannah's family doctor heard what was going on, Nicole says he wanted to have Hannah involuntarily committed because he feared Brian would kill her. And Hannah's next move caused even more consternation: she asked McDearmond to drop the investigation.",
      "Hannah Pettey: I said, \"he's a family man.\" I said, \"he loves me. He loves the kids.\" \u2026 It just doesn't make sense.",
      "McDearmond knew without Hannah's help, the criminal case against Brian would likely collapse. But he understood what Hannah was feeling.",
      "Lt. Alan McDearmond: It's typical of domestic violence \u2026 to forgive your abuser \u2026",
      "McDearmond asked Hannah to sign a specific form that he'd prepared.",
      "Lt. Alan McDearmond: And she said, well, what do I have to sign this for? \u2026 And I said, well, if \u2026 Brian were to kill you in the future, and somebody from your family \u2026 comes and says that we didn't do our due diligence in the investigation, then I can show them that you didn't want to pursue it. ... So, if you want to go ahead and sign that, then we'll close it up. And she said, \"No, I'm not going to sign that.\" \u2026 She said, \"I want you to keep going.\"",
      "Ultimately, she decided to proceed with the divorce and cooperate with the criminal investigation.",
      "Anne Marie Green: What do you learn from Hannah?",
      "Lt. Alan McDearmond: \u2026 more than anything insurance policies.",
      "Hannah told McDearmond that Brian had taken out life insurance policies on her while they were still dating. McDearmond learned that when Hannah was in the hospital fighting for her life, Brian tried to take out even more policies. If they were approved, Brian would have collected more than $5 million upon Hannah's death.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: And that gave you what?",
      "Lt. Alan McDearmond: Well it gives you motive \u2026 money's a motive, money's a huge motive.",
      "At that point, McDearmond felt he'd collected enough evidence to move ahead and so did prosecutor Garrick Vickery.",
      "Garrick Vickery: We knew Hannah had been poisoned, that it was intentional and that it was ingested.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: You don't have any capsules with lead. You have a theory, you have a suspect, and you have what you believe is a motive. Why were you confident that this was enough to put in front of a grand jury?",
      "Garrick Vickery: Nothing else made sense \u2026 In this case, the evidence was clear that lead was getting into her system. So, then you rewind the tape, you back up, and you see how that lead could have gotten into her system. \u2026 And Brian Mann was the only person who had access to Hannah.",
      "The grand jury agreed and in September 2022, Brian Mann was arrested and pleaded \"not guilty\" to attempted murder. He was freed on a $500,000 bond but was required to report to jail every weekend.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: Can I see the ankle monitor?",
      "Brian Mann: Sure.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: What's it like having to wear that?",
      "Brian Mann: \u2026 I mean, it's definitely annoying.",
      "Police still had nothing connecting Brian to any form of lead. But then, they got an unexpected call. Turns out Danny Hill thought he knew exactly where the lead came from.",
      "It all began when Brian asked Hill, a contractor, to line his X-ray room at his chiropractic office with, you guessed it: lead. Hill had recognized Brian from a newspaper article about his arrest and got in touch with McDearmond.",
      "Danny Hill: You do an X-ray room, the walls have to be lined with lead \u2026 for the protection of the people outside the room. \u2026 We did it with rolls of soft lead that we just covered the walls with and then put drywall all over the top of that.",
      "\"48 Hours\" asked Hill to obtain a sample of the same type of lead he installed in Brian's office.",
      "The lead was heavy but surprisingly soft and malleable. Hill showed us how easy it is to scrape the sheet of lead into tiny shavings \u2014 just like pencil shavings \u2014and how easy it is to put those shavings into an empty pill capsule.",
      "Danny Hill: \u2026 that's just the shaving of the lead.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: Oh.",
      "Danny Hill: This soft.",
      "After Hill was done with the V-ray room, he asked Brian if he should dispose of the remaining lead.",
      "Danny Hill: And he said, I'll take care of it \u2026",
      "Hill's information sent cops directly to Brian's office. Prior to Hill's revelations, the Hartselle Police Department did not have probable cause. Now they did.",
      "Lt. Alan McDearmond: And we got a search warrant. We went in and we took a section of that out \u2026",
      "Lt. Alan McDearmond: The lead that we recovered from the office was very thin \u2026 it would be thin enough that it could be shaved or whatever.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: Tell me about how important that phone call was from the contractor.",
      "Garrick Vickery: It was vitally important. It's always necessary \u2026 to put your murder weapon into the hands of a defendant.",
      "But Brian insists the state's case is weak, and so he got himself a strong advocate \u2014 bodybuilder and defense lawyer Chad Morgan.",
      "Chad Morgan: There's no reason that any of their evidence should be able to get into a courtroom \u2026",
      "Going into the trial in June 2025, Brian had been forbidden any visitation with his children for more than two years. He says it was just unfair.",
      "Brian Mann: I should have never been separated from my kids. \u2026 I'm going to be back in their lives. \u2026 I've just been waiting for my chance.",
      "The trial of Brian Mann",
      "Anne-Marie Green: How does it feel to know that someone tried to kill you?",
      "Hannah Pettey: \u2026 at night I get really creeped out thinking about that someone poisoned me for a long, long time \u2026",
      "BEN HOOVER [ Local news report]: The state started its case today against a Morgan County chiropractor charged with attempting to kill his wife \u2026 Mann maintains his innocence \u2026",
      "In June 2025, defendant Brian Mann walks into a Decatur, Alabama, courthouse, facing a possible life sentence. No cameras are permitted inside the courtroom during the trial.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: What was your working theory as to what happened in this case with this crime?",
      "Garrick Vickery: It really begins months before Hannah ever appears at UAB Hospital \u2026",
      "Lead prosecutor Garrick Vickery.",
      "Garrick Vickery: In terms of a \u2014 a theory, it mostly was that he made a decision to slowly poison her, to gain this life insurance, to rid himself of a sweet, sweet person \u2026",
      "Brian's defense attorney Chad Morgan tells the jury that police never found any lead-filled capsules in Brian's home, office or anywhere else.",
      "Chad Morgan: \u2026 they searched the entire house top to bottom, never found one piece of lead.",
      "Garrick Vickery: One of the issues we had was that Brian Mann had months and months \u2026 to execute his plan and then to get rid of the evidence. \u2026",
      "But the state does have Hannah, and prosecutors make her the first witness.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: Did you look at Brian when you walked into the courtroom?",
      "Hannah Pettey: I did \u2026",
      "Anne-Marie Green: \u2026 was that the man that you had fallen in love with?",
      "Hannah Pettey: No, I mean, I saw someone totally different \u2026",
      "Hannah tells the jury how Brian supplied her with vitamin capsules each night even when her pain was so intense she could barely swallow.",
      "Hannah Pettey: I remember, um, being in bed one night and I was in so much pain, and I was so nauseous \u2026 and Brian was like \u2026 I put your vitamins on your nightstand. \u2026 And he was like, \"you need to take 'em.\" And I was like, I just can't tonight. I do not think I can keep anything else down. \u2026 and he was like freaking out about it. Like he was like, \"you gotta take it\" \u2026",
      "Anne-Marie Green: How easy would it have been to put lead in those capsules?",
      "Garrick Vickery: Tremendously easy \u2026 Anyone that's sharpened a pencil could see how easy it is to get lead shavings. \u2026 And once you have that and you have two hands to separate a pill and put it back together, you've got all the instruments you need to try to murder your spouse.",
      "Brian's attorney alleges Hannah's own mother Nicole could have been the one poisoning Hannah.",
      "Chad Morgan: I'm suggesting they're looking in the wrong place.",
      "He claims Nicole gave Hannah milkshakes that could have been laced with lead.",
      "Chad Morgan: \u2026 tell me why her mom was coming to her house every day for almost a year, giving her a milkshake.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: Did you look into her mother?",
      "Kelly Cimino: The thought was considered \u2026 you \u2014 you don't want to rule anyone out before.",
      "Assistant District Attorney Kelly Cimino.",
      "Kelly Cimino: And Nicole just didn't have that kind of access to her daughter.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: Did your mom bring you milkshakes?",
      "Hannah Pettey: No, not that I recall \u2026I don't even like milkshakes. I really don't even like milkshakes \u2026 I don't drink milkshakes.",
      "Hannah tells the jury how the pain affected her. Her body, in a sense, the crime scene and her brain scans, blood work and X-rays are discussed in open court. But there's something she's been holding back until she takes the stand.",
      "Hannah Pettey: It is kind of emotional to talk about the fact that I can't have children anymore.",
      "On the day she was discharged, Hannah was smiling but, inside, she was heartbroken. Doctors had just told her she could no longer have children. She was only 22 years old.",
      "When it's Nicole's turn to take the stand, she thinks she knows what's coming from Brian's defense attorney.",
      "Nicole Pettey: I know \u2026 that he was gonna try to say that, possibly say that I had did this. \u2026 And I wasn't really concerned about that because \u2026 I didn't do it \u2026",
      "Cimino explains why prosecutors believe Brian used lead-filled capsules instead of mixing the lead into her food.",
      "Kelly Cimino: \u2026 she would have tasted it. \u2026 And so that's where \u2026 the \u2026 theory of the capsule comes in because it's the only way that she would've willingly put it in her mouth and swallowed it and not noticed anything different \u2026",
      "After a day-and-a-half and seven witnesses, the state rests its case. And then so does the defense. Chad Morgan calls no witnesses.",
      "Hannah Pettey:\u00a0 I was shocked that they've had three years to put this together and then it comes out that he has no defense at all.",
      "Brian's lawyer says he did his job and maintains that the lack of evidence in the state's case is the best evidence of all.",
      "Chad Morgan: There was a lot of assumptions about this is lead and that's lead, but there was not one person that testified to anything that they actually saw him do, touch or even begin to believe that \u2026 she ingested something he gave her.",
      "The jury gets the case on a Wednesday afternoon, and the next day returns a verdict: guilty.",
      "Jeff Sollee: There was a \u2014 about a second of shock \u2026 I don't think he was expecting that.",
      "Juror Jeff Solee.",
      "Jeff Sollee: That guy's a monster.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: Why do you say that?",
      "Jeff Sollee: The arrogance it takes to essentially watch somebody waste away \u2026 And then not only watch during the poisoning, but also watch during, you know, the downfall. \u2026 I think that takes a very special person.",
      "Hannah Pettey: \u2026 it took me a few seconds for it to -- to \u2026\u00a0 sink in that it was a guilty verdict. \u2026I just immediately started feeling the tears well up because it was just this build up and I just had to step out.",
      "Lt. Alan McDearmond: This is a great win for all domestic violence victims, especially those that are scared to come forward.",
      "McDearmond is now chief of the Hartselle Police Department. And after a lot of reflection, Hannah allows herself to consider a hard truth.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: Do you think he ever loved you?",
      "Hannah Pettey: No, I truly don't think that he did \u2026 I just don't think any of it was real.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: It's gotta be hard to say.",
      "Hannah Pettey: Yeah.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: Cause it was real for you.",
      "Hannah Pettey: Yes. It was very real for me.",
      "Now it's very real for Brian who was sentenced to life in prison in August 2025. And Hannah, who was once feared to be so brain-damaged that she would never be able to testify, graduated from college with a teaching degree.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: And what does Hannah's new life look like?",
      "Hannah Pettey: You know I'm a teacher, so I'm starting at a new school this year. So, I'm just gonna focus on being the best teacher that I can be and \u2026 being the best mother I can be.",
      "Life got even sweeter for Hannah when she and the children moved back into their old home, the one they used to share with Brian.",
      "Hannah Pettey: I've repainted \u2026 I redecorated everything, cleaned it up really good. \u2026 I got all my stuff moved in there and just pictures of us three all in there. So now it feels like ours.",

      "Det. Aaron Lewallen: Ranger Bess approached me \u2026 and he asked if I thought we had a case that would fit the bill for that type of investigation. I said, \"absolutely. I know the perfect case for this.\" And it was the Catherine Edwards case.",
      "So, in April 2020, the DNA from Catherine Edwards' crime scene went to Othram, a lab outside of Houston, for testing.",
      "Det. Aaron Lewallen: There, they would give us familial matches. And from there, we would start trying to build a family tree to get us closer to our suspect.",
      "But the number of names to pursue was overwhelming.",
      "Det. Aaron Lewallen: When the family tree began to grow beyond my computer screen, (laughs) I started to get a little bit confused. And that's when \u2026 Tina jumped on board.",
      "Det. Aaron's Lewallen's wife, Tina Lewallen, an auto crimes detective, began using her off hours to help sort through it.",

Tina Lewallen: I'm researching the matches and building my trees and you're researching other people's trees \u2026 I kept noticing Shera LaPoint \u2014 had built that tree, and then I'm working some more, I do some more research. Well, Shera LaPoint built this tree. And I'm like, is she related to our suspect? \u2026 I had no idea who she was.",
      "And when they called her, they found out LaPoint had been building her family tree.",
      "Shera LaPoint: It was my family's DNA kits that I had uploaded to GEDmatch.",
      "And then they found out something that changed the course of the investigation. LaPoint was known professionally as \"The Gene Hunter\" and already skilled at working these cases.\u00a0 She'd identified one of the women buried along Interstate Highway 45 in the Texas killing fields case.",
      "And she agreed to lend her expertise.",
      "Shera LaPoint: I told him that I was willing to help.",

      "It was a complicated, multilayered process using publicly available DNA, birth and death records \u2014 finding parents, siblings and cousins.",
      "Shera LaPoint: As you build those trees, you look for information that \u2026 is pertinent to the case that you're working on. We had a tag for people who were in Beaumont \u2026 She was a teacher. As you build tree, you look at people who are in education.",
      "The tree grew up and down and sideways \u2013 there were almost 7,500 names.",
      "Shera LaPoint: That's a lot of hours, a lot of work and a lot of people in a family tree.",
      "All the while, Det. Tina Lewallen hardly slept, working through most nights \u2014 knowing there was a killer still out there.",

      "Det. Tina Lewallen: She was a team player from jump. Never had met me. \u2026 we talked so often that we became friends.",
      "Natalie Morales: Best buds.",
      "Shera LaPoint: Best buds. I don't know what else to say.",
      "And when they needed DNA, they turned to Det. Tina Lewallen's husband, Det. Aaron Lewallen, and Texas Ranger Brandon Bess.",
      "Det. Aaron Lewallen: So, from that point, me and Brandon Bess would drive around Texas and go talk to these people.",
      "Ranger Brandon Bess: Convincing someone \u2026 to give their DNA up, to give a piece of themselves up to you in a homicide investigation can be very difficult.",
      "Ranger Brandon Bess: When we would sense, um, anxiety in someone, Aaron would immediately tell them, \"hey, who do you want to play you in the movie ...\"",
      "Ranger Brandon Bess: And they would look at Aaron like he was crazy \u2026 and say, (laughs) um, \"what are you talking about.\" \"Well, this guy's a Texas Ranger, everything they do turns into a movie. Who do you want to play your role in this movie?\" (laughs) That calmed them down every time \u2026 and I of course threw out there, \"hey, I've already got Brad Pitt. So, you know, you can't \u2014 you can't be Brad \u2013 cause Brad's playing me.\"",
      "Natalie Morales: Was there ever a time though that somebody actually thought \u2026 my uncle may actually be a killer. Who knows?",
      "Ranger Brandon Bess: In every one of these cases that I've worked using DNA and genetic genealogy, you have at least one person, usually two or three that says, you know what, I had that weird Uncle Joe \u2026",
      "Once the uploads were compared to the killer's DNA, if the amount of shared genetic material was low, they knew it was a dead end.",
      "Det. Aaron Lewallen: Cause there were times when we would come across a name and I'm like \u2014 you get that that butterflies in your stomach \u2026 \u00a0like, \"hey, maybe this is our guy\" \u2026 And then \u2026 turns out it's not our guy.",
      "After almost three month of ups and down and nearly nonstop work, LaPoint hit paydirt.",
      "Shera LaPoint: It was about 10:30 at night.",
      "She was working a family line very distantly related to her own.",
      "Shera LaPoint: It was a very common Cajun name, Thibodeaux. \u2026 I got to a couple who were in Beaumont \u2026 I was able to see from, uh, records that they had two sons.",
      "This was a major lead: a family, in Catherine's town, with two sons who went to Forest Park High \u2013 the same school Catherine did \u2014 at around the same time.",
      "Shera LaPoint: I put the names in the tree and I messaged Tina and I said, um, \"there's a couple in Beaumont.\"",
      "Shera LaPoint: I'm tired, I'm going to bed. And I turned my cellphone off and I fell asleep on the sofa \u2026 and when I woke up the next morning, my phone had just blown up.",
      "Natalie Morales: And it was you on the other end?",
      "Det. Tina Lewallen: Yes.",
      "Natalie Morales: What were you saying?",
      "Det. Tina Lewallen: This is them. We found them. Just didn't know which one.",
      "Natalie Morales: OK \u2026 it's either Michael Foreman or Clayton Foreman. What did you do to \u2014 to figure that out?",
      "Det. Aaron Lewallen: The first name I ran was Clayton \u2026 And when I came across his prior conviction for the sexual assault, the hair on the back of my neck stood up. I'm like, \"this is our guy.\"",
      "In 1981, a 19-year-old woman told police that Clayton Foreman bound her hands and raped her.\u00a0 She had also gone to Forest Park High School where Clayton was the manager of the football team. Clayton Foreman was convicted but was given probation and paid a fine.",
      "Natalie Morales: But he did not have to give a DNA sample at that time.",
      "Det. Aaron Lewallen: No. This was back in the early '80s. We didn't have sex offender registry, uh, no DNA database.",
      "And then they found another connection: it went all way back to Dianna Coe, Catherine's friend from middle school.",
      "In high school, Coe fell madly in love. Her boyfriend had graduated three years ahead of her, and they got engaged.",
      "Dianna Coe: He was so kind. \u2026 He had the most wonderful personality.",
      "And when she started planning her wedding, she immediately turned to her old friends Catherine and Allison.",
      "Dianna Coe: And they were one of the first ones I thought of as, uh, bridesmaid and \u2014 and I asked them and they said yes.",
      "And the groom? The man Coe married back in 1982? Now he was their number one suspect: Clayton Foreman.",
      "Natalie Morales: She in fact did know him.",
      "Det. Aaron Lewallen: Yes.",
      "In hindsight, there were signs. When Coe found out about Clayton Foreman's legal troubles, the wedding was less than three months away.",
      "Dianna Coe: \u2026 and \u2026 the wedding invitations had already been mailed out.",
      "Dianna Coe: And I said, \"rape?\" I said, \"oh, there's no way.\"",
      "But she never got any details and her fianc\u00e9 explained it away.",
      "Dianna Coe: \u2026 he kept telling me, it \u2014 it was a big misunderstanding \u2026 And so in my mind, I thought, well, he must be telling the truth because if he got arrested, he's not in jail.",
      "Natalie Morales: But you didn't really believe it was rape?",
      "Dianna Coe: Right.",
      "Coe's sister, Anne Anderson, and her brother, Scooter Daleo, were not so sure and neither were their parents who wanted her to call it off.",
      "Scooter Daleo: And I said, well, \"Dianna, why don't you just wait?\" \u2026 And she didn't wanna wait. She wanted to marry Clay. She was in love with him.",
      "Anne Anderson: \u2026 she's believing him and she's wanting to get married, then \u2014 then we have to support as a family.",
      "Dianna Coe: And he was like, I'm so, so sorry. \u2026 I love you. I want us to be married. I want us to have a family. \u2026 And so, I was like, OK, you know. So I went \u2014 I went through with it.",
      "Dianna and Clayton Foreman stayed married for a little more than 11 years and they had a son. The relationship began to fray over Foreman lying about their finances and it ended after he had an affair. And looking back, Coe can see that he had an unhealthy fascination with police officers and the tools of their trade \u2014 like handcuffs.",
      "Dianna Coe: I remember that he had ordered those handcuffs. \u2026 Well, he had 'em hung over the rearview mirror \u2026 And I \u2014 I didn't think anything of it.",
      "When Catherine was killed, they were divorced, but Coe remembers calling her ex-husband to talk about it.",
      "Dianna Coe: I think I was, you know, crying and I said, \"oh, my God,\" I said, \"somebody has murdered Catherine.\" And \u2014 and he goes,\" oh, really?\" Just like no emotion \u2026 When we hung the phone up, I can remember 'cause I was like kind of squinting and kind of like going, God, that's kind of odd.",
      "With all the mounting evidence, Foreman needed to be found. He was 60 and no longer living in Beaumont. They quickly tracked him to Reynoldsberg, Ohio.",
      "Natalie Morales: What was he doing there?",
      "Det. Aaron Lewallen: He was an Uber driver at the time. \u2026 I was able to send a lead, uh, to a field office up there \u2026 and basically did what we call a trash run.",
      "Natalie Morales: You need to collect a piece of DNA so that you can ensure that it's the \u2014 the right guy, right?",
      "Det. Aaron Lewallen: Correct. Uh, so, that's what they did. \u2026 They surveilled his house \u2026 and then went and snatched a bag of trash \u2026 and sent it to me.",
      "Det. Aaron Lewallen: Uh, so, I brought that stuff to Houston, to the DPS crime lab. And from there they tested it.",
      "The likelihood that the DNA belonged to Clayton Foreman was a big number \u2014 461 septillion. It doesn't get better than that, says LaPoint.",
      "Shera LaPoint: I mean, you can't fight those odds. You cannot fight those odds.",
      "And that was all they needed.",
      "Det. Aaron Lewallen: And I got a text from a \u2014 a DPS lab technician. And she said, \"go get his ass.\"",
      "Det. Aaron Lewallen and Ranger Bess were about to hop a plane to Ohio, ready to face the man they felt sure had killed Catherine.",
      "And while they're doing that, Det. Tina Lewallen pays a visit to Coe.",
      "Natalie Morales: Did they tell you we had \u2014 they had DNA, though? Tina told you that?",
      "Dianna Coe: Oh, yeah. Yeah.",
      "Dianna Coe: And I just went (gasps) \"Oh my God, please don't tell me it was Clay \u2013\"",
      "Dianna Coe: I almost fell to the ground. \u2026 I was just like, \"oh, my God.\" Like, \"oh, God, I can't believe he's done this.\"",

      "When Ranger Bess and Det. Aaron Lewallen arrive at the Franklin County Sheriff's Office to confront Clayton Foreman, they have a cover story \u2013 it's about a lost item from one of Foreman's Uber rides.",
      "Ranger Brandon Bess: We go in under the \u2014 uh, under the ruse of someone had left, uh, a purse in his car. So he came in \u2014 voluntarily to talk about a purse that was in the car.",
      "It was April 29, 2021 \u2014 26 years after Catherine Edwards was murdered, and they are sure they are sitting in front of the man who murdered her.",
      "RANGER BESS (Foreman interview): We're asking you to visit with us about a crime that we're investigating. OK?",

      "Det. Aaron Lewallen: No, he didn't",
      "RANGER BESS (Foreman interview): So, the crime that we're looking at is the murder of Mary Catherine Edwards. \u2026 and she was murdered in 1995.",
      "Natalie Morales: I guess he pretty quickly realized he wasn't there to give up a purse.",
      "Ranger Brandon Bess: He did \u2026",

    "published": "Sat, 10 Jan 2026 21:40:56 -0500",
    "summary": "Bob Weir wrote or co-wrote and sang lead vocals on Grateful Dead classics including \"Sugar Magnolia,\" \"One More Saturday Night\" and \"Mexicali Blues.\"",
    "story": [
      "Bob Weir, a founding member of the legendary rock band the Grateful Dead, has died at the age of 78, his family announced Saturday.",
      "\"It is with profound sadness that we share the passing of Bobby Weir,\" his family wrote in a post to his Instagram page. \"He transitioned peacefully, surrounded by loved ones, after courageously beating cancer as only Bobby could. Unfortunately, he succumbed to underlying lung issues.\"",
      "In the statement, the family disclosed that Weir had been diagnosed with cancer in July.",
      "\"As we remember Bobby, it's hard not to feel the echo of the way he lived,\" his family wrote. \"A man driftin' and dreamin', never worrying if the road would lead him home. A child of countless trees. A child of boundless seas.\"",
      "Weir formed the Grateful Dead with Jerry Garcia after the two met in 1963 as teens in Palo Alto, California. The band, with its unique mix of blues, folk and jazz, became a touring powerhouse for decades until Garcia's death in 1995.",
      "Weir wrote or co-wrote and sang lead vocals on Dead classics including \"Sugar Magnolia,\" \"One More Saturday Night\" and \"Mexicali Blues.\"",
      "The group eventually reformed a few years after Garcia's death and took many iterations over the years, the latest as Dead & Company.",
      "\"For over sixty years, Bobby took to the road,\" his family's statement said. \"A guitarist, vocalist, storyteller, and founding member of the Grateful Dead. Bobby will forever be a guiding force whose unique artistry reshaped American music. His work did more than fill rooms with music; it was warm sunlight that filled the soul, building a community, a language, and a feeling of family that generations of fans carry with them.\"",
      "Weir's death leaves drummer Bill Kreutzmann as the only surviving original member. Founding bassist Phil Lesh died in 2024. The band's other drummer, Mickey Hart, practically an original member since joining in 1967, is also alive at 82. The fifth founding member, Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan, died in 1973.",
      "Dead and Company played a series of concert's for the Grateful Dead's 60th anniversary in July at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco.",
      "Born in San Francisco and raised in nearby Atherton, Weir was the Dead's youngest member and looked like a fresh-faced high-schooler in its early years. He was generally less shaggy than the rest of the band, but had a long beard like Garcia's in later years.",
      "The band would survive long past the hippie moment of its birth, with its ultra-devoted fans known as Deadheads often following them on the road in a virtually non-stop tour that persisted despite decades of music and culture shifting around them.",
      "\"Longevity was never a major concern of ours,\" Weir said when the Dead got the Grammys' Musicares Person of the Year honor last year. \"Spreading joy through the music was all we ever really had in mind and we got plenty of that done.\"",
      "Ubiquitous bumper stickers and T-shirts showed the band's skull logo, the dancing, colored bears that served as their other symbol, and signature phrases like \"ain't no time to hate\" and \"not all who wander are lost.\"",
      "The Dead won few actual Grammys during their career \u2014 they were always a little too esoteric \u2014 getting only a lifetime achievement award in 2007 and the best music film award in 2018.",
      "Just as rare were hit pop singles. \"Touch of Grey,\" the 1987 song that brought a big surge in the aging band's popularity, was their only Billboard Top 10 hit.",
      "But in 2024, they set a record for all artists with their 59th album in Billboard's Top 40. Forty-one of those came since 2012, thanks to the popularity of the series of archival albums compiled by David Lemieux.",
      "Their music \u2014 called acid rock at its inception \u2014 would pull in blues, jazz, country, folk and psychedelia in long improvisational jams at their concerts.",
      "\"I venture to say they are the great American band,\" TV personality and devoted Deadhead Andy Cohen said as host of the MusiCares event. \"What a wonder they are.\"",

What came to be known as the Monroe Doctrine would influence U.S. foreign policy for generations, and lead to military interventions across the Western Hemisphere. This past week President Donald Trump repeatedly invoked the Doctrine when discussing last week's incursion into Venezuela.

      "\"We don't want to be Americans, we don't want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders,\" Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen and four party leaders said in a statement Friday night.",
      "Mr. Trump reiterated on Friday that he would like to make a deal to acquire Greenland, a semi-autonomous region that's part of NATO ally Denmark, \"the easy way.\" He said that if the U.S. doesn't own it, then Russia or China will take it over, and the U.S. does not want them as neighbors. NATO allies and Greenland have disagreed with Mr. Trump's assessment.",
      "\"If we don't do it the easy way, we're going to do it the hard way,\" Mr. Trump said, without explaining what that entailed. The White House stated that it is considering a range of options, including the use of military force, to acquire the island. U.S. Senator Rand Paul told CBS Mornings\u00a0earlier this week that he \"will do everything to stop any kind of military takeover of Greenland.\"",
      "Greenland's party leaders reiterated that \"Greenland's future must be decided by the Greenlandic people.\"",
      "\"As Greenlandic party leaders, we would like to emphasize once again our wish that the United States' contempt for our country ends,\" the statement said.",

      "Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has warned that an American takeover of Greenland would mark\u00a0the end of NATO.",
      "The party leaders' statement said that \"the work on Greenland's future takes place in dialogue with the Greenlandic people and is prepared on the basis of international laws.\"",
      "\"No other country can interfere in this,\" they said. \"We must decide the future of our country ourselves, without pressure for quick decision, delay or interference from other countries.\"",

    "summary": "The Washington National Opera is moving performances away from the Kennedy Center.",
    "story": [
      "The Washington National Opera announced Friday that it will move performances away from the Kennedy Center in another high-profile departure following President Trump's takeover of the U.S. capital's leading performing arts venue.",
      "The opera said it will seek to end its affiliation with the Kennedy Center through an \"amicable transition\" and will return to operating independently. It cited financial constraints imposed after Mr. Trump fired the Kennedy Center's board and installed allies to oversee it.",
      "The opera will reduce its spring season and move performances to other venues \"to ensure fiscal prudence and fulfill its obligations for a balanced budget,\" the opera said in a statement.",
      "The statement did not mention Mr. Trump or the decision by the Kennedy Center's new board to add the president's name to the venue. Though Congress still formally calls it the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the building's exterior and website now refer to it as the Trump Kennedy Center.",
      "Ric Grenell, a Trump aide serving as the Center's interim executive director, said the venue has spent millions to support the Washington National Opera, but it continues to operate at a deficit.",
      "Parting ways will provide \"the flexibility and funds to bring in operas from around the world and across the U.S.,\" Grenell wrote on X.",
      "Prior to his second term, Mr. Trump had a\u00a0strained relationship\u00a0with the Kennedy Center dating back to when he announced that he and first lady Melania Trump\u00a0would not attend\u00a0the Kennedy Center Honors in 2017 after some of that year's recipients threatened a boycott.",
      "According to its website, the Kennedy Center hosts over 2,200 performances, events and exhibits a year, with over two million visitors annually. The center was created by Congress in 1958 and serves as a living memorial to John F. Kennedy.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u00a0told CBS News\u00a0on Wednesday that he has \"bigger fish to fry\" rather than commenting on the Kennedy Center name change. The HHS secretary said he was not involved in the decision and did not recommend against the name change.\u00a0When asked whether he personally had a problem with the name change, after several members of his own family\u00a0publicly criticized it, Kennedy said his focus remains on \"making America healthy again.\"",
      "Artists ranging from \"Hamilton\" creator Lin-Manuel Miranda to rock star Peter Wolf have also\u00a0called off events at the Kennedy Center\u00a0since Mr. Trump ousted the previous leadership early last year and arranged for himself to head the board of trustees. The December rebranding as the Trump Kennedy Center led to a new wave of cancellations.",
      "Opera officials said the Center's new business model requires productions to be fully funded in advance, which it said is \"incompatible with opera operations.\" Ticket sales cover only a fraction of production costs, and opera companies rely on grants and donations to make up the difference but can't secure them years in advance, when they're planning productions.",
      "The business model also doesn't accommodate the opera's model practice of using revenue from popular works to subsidize lower-grossing, lesser-known works, the opera said.",
      "\"I have been proud to be affiliated with a national monument to the human spirit, a place that has long served as an inviting home for our ever-growing family of artists and opera lovers,\" said Francesca Zambello, the Washington National Opera's artistic director for the past 14 years.",
      "She vowed to continue offering a variety of shows, \"from monumental classics to more contemporary works.\"",
      "Late Friday, WNO productions of \"Treemonisha,\" \"The Crucible\" and \"West Side Story\" were still listed on the Kennedy Center website.",

      "Authorities in New Mexico issued an arrest warrant Friday for director and Emmy Award-winning actor Timothy Busfield to face a child sex abuse charge.",
      "An investigator with the Albuquerque Police Department filed a criminal complaint in support of the charge, which says a child reported that Busfield touched him inappropriately. The acts allegedly occurred on the set of \"The Cleaning Lady,\" a TV series that Busfield directed and acted in.",
      "The child said the first incident happened when he was 7 years old and Busfield touched him three or four times. Busfield allegedly touched him five or six times on another occasion when he was 8.",
      "The child's mother reported to Child Protective Services that the abuse occurred between November 2022 and spring 2024, the complaint said.",
      "Busfield's attorney and agent did not immediately respond to email messages seeking comment late Friday.",
      "The arrest warrant, which was signed by a judge, said the charge is for two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor.",
      "According to the complaint, the child, which it identifies only by his initials, has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. A social worker documented him saying he has had nightmares about Busfield touching him and woken up scared.",
      "The child was reportedly afraid to tell anyone because Busfield was the director and he feared he would get mad at him.",
      "The investigation began in November 2024, when the investigator responded to a call from a doctor at the University of New Mexico Hospital. The child's parents had gone there at the recommendation of a law firm, the complaint said.",
      "\"The Cleaning Lady\" aired for four seasons on Fox, ending in 2025. It starred Elodie Yung as a Cambodian doctor who comes to the United States to get medical treatment for her son, witnesses a mob killing and ends up becoming a cleaner for organized crime.",
      "The show was produced by Warner Bros., which according to the complaint conducted its own investigation into the abuse allegations but was unable to corroborate them.",
      "Busfield is known for appearances in \"The West Wing,\" \"Field of Dreams\" and \"Thirtysomething,\" the latter of which won him an Emmy for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series in 1991.",

    "summary": "Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother of 3, was shot and killed by an ICE agent in Minneapolis. Her father describes her as warm and witty and someone who cared deeply about others.",
    "story": [
      "The death of Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old woman who was shot and killed by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis on Wednesday, has sparked national outcry.",
      "Her father, Timothy Granger, tells \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil that she was the kind of person who always cared deeply about other people. He described her as warm, witty, and with a bubbly personality.",
      "She grew up in Colorado Springs as one of five children, and had three children of her own \u2014 two from her first marriage and a 6-year-old from her second. Her father said she had recently moved to Minneapolis to restart her life after what he described as an awful stretch following the sudden death of her husband.",
      "Good, who was a U.S. citizen, was a legal observer of federal actions in the city and was not a target for arrest by ICE agents, city leaders said.",
      "\"Renee Nicole Good was a wife, mother, poet, singer, member of the LGBTQI+ community, and United States citizen,\" the\u00a012 co-chairs of the Congressional Equality Caucus\u00a0said in a joint statement released Saturday. The Openly-LGBTQI+ U.S. Representatives called for a full, transparent and open investigation into the shooting.",
      "The Associated Press\u00a0reports she had just dropped her 6-year-old off at school and was driving home with her wife when she encountered the ICE agents.",
      "Good's father said the orphaned child has a loving extended family and will be \"well taken care of.\"",
      "Here's more about what we know so far about Good and the fatal shooting.",
      "A \"poet and writer and wife and mom\" who recently moved to Minneapolis",
      "Renee Good described herself in the bio of her Instagram profile as a \"poet and writer and wife and mom\" who was currently \"experiencing Minneapolis.\"",
      "Her mother, Donna Ganger, told the Minnesota Star Tribune that the family was notified of the death late Wednesday morning. Ganger told the newspaper that her daughter wasn't part of a protest and said her daughter \"was probably terrified.\"",
      "\"Renee was one of the kindest people I've ever known,\" Ganger told the Tribune. \"She was extremely compassionate. She's taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being.\"",
      "After working briefly in banking in Colorado, her father said she moved east, got a degree from Old Dominion University in Virginia, becoming a poet and English teacher. She was working as a substitute teacher in Minneapolis, he said.",
      "Her first husband told the AP that Good had previously worked as a dental assistant and at a credit union before spending some time as a stay-at-home mother in recent years.",
      "Good was widowed when her husband, Timmy Ray Macklin Jr., died in 2023 at age 36, the Tribune reported. He was the father of her 6-year-old son; AP reported that Good's two older children are a 12-year-old son and a 15-year-old daughter.",
      "In a statement released to Minnesota Public Radio, her wife, Becca Good, who was in the car during the shooting, thanked people from all over the country who reached out to show their support.",
      "\"if you ever encountered my wife, Renee Nicole Macklin Good, you know that above all else, she was kind. In fact, kindness radiated out of her,\" she wrote.",
      "\"Renee lived by an overarching belief: there is kindness in the world and we need to do everything we can to find it where it resides and nurture it where it needs to grow. Renee was a Christian who knew that all religions teach the same essential truth: we are here to love each other, care for each other, and keep each other safe and whole.\"",
      "Good graduated from Old Dominion in December 2020 and received a poetry prize from the university, the English department announced in a Facebook\u00a0post\u00a0that year. The post said Good studied creative writing and hosted a podcast.",
      "\"It is with great sadness that Old Dominion University mourns the loss of one of our own, Renee (Macklin) Good,\" said Brian Hemphill, the university's president, in a\u00a0statement.\u00a0Hemphill described her death as a \"tragic killing\" and \"yet another clear example that fear and violence have sadly become commonplace in our nation.\"",
      "AP also reports it appears she was never charged with anything involving law enforcement beyond a traffic ticket.",
      "\"Devastated for that whole family\"",
      "Joan Rose, who was Good's former neighbor in Kansas City, Missouri, told CBS affiliate\u00a0KCTV\u00a0that Good's family had lived across the street from her until December 2024. Rose said she didn't know the family well but called them \"lovely neighbors.\" Good had lived in the Waldo neighborhood with her partner, young son and dogs, and Rose said the two older children routinely visited them.",
      "Rose said she thought Good's family had planned to move to Canada when they left Missouri last year.",
      "\"I heard they were moving to Canada because of the politics here,\" she told KCTV. \"I had thought about them sometimes, you know, passing by their house thinking, 'Oh, I hope they're OK in Canada, you know, I hope that they're living, you know, a good life and that they're, they're worry free.' And this is just the opposite of that. So, I'm just devastated for that whole family.\"",
      "A GoFundMe campaign established in the wake of the shooting is asking the public to \"support the wife and son of Renee Good as they grapple with the devastating loss of their wife and mother.\"",
      "\"Renee was pure sunshine, pure, love,\" reads the fundraiser's description. \"She will be desperately missed.\"",
      "The campaign has raised nearly $500,000 as of Thursday morning.",
      "A community vigil held for Good in Minneapolis on Wednesday night drew a large crowd of attendees, many of whom shared emotional and frustrated remarks about the latest ICE operations that have recently ramped up across the region,\u00a0CBS Minnesota\u00a0reported. Protests also took place in other cities around the U.S.",
      "The agent involved in the shooting was part of a surge of roughly 2,000 federal agents and officers\u00a0the Trump administration recently deployed to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area in a response to both immigration and Minnesota's\u00a0fraud scandal.",
      "Shooting captured on video",
      "Police responded to a call reporting the shooting, which happened in a neighborhood in south Minneapolis, at about 9:30 a.m. local time Wednesday, according to the city. When officers arrived, they found that a woman, later identified as Good, had been shot in the head. She was rushed by firefighters to a Minneapolis hospital, where she later died, the city said.",
      "Federal officials, including Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, characterized the shooting as an act of self-defense on the part of the ICE agent who fired the weapon when the driver \"attacked them and those surrounding them and attempted to run them over and ram them with her vehicle.\" However, numerous witnesses and local leaders are questioning that account.",
      "Multiple videos have circulated online of the incident, which show the woman in a maroon Honda Pilot SUV on a residential street when an ICE agent approached and addressed her through the window of her vehicle. Several other agents stood nearby.",
      "In one of the videos, an officer can be heard telling the woman to \"get out of the f****** car\" before reaching for the Honda's door handle. At that point, the Honda is seen backing up as another agent steps in front of the car. The Honda then begins to drive away, and the agent in front of it fires his weapon into the car. Whether the agent was hit by the car, as federal officials have said, is not clear based on the videos. They show the agent move to the side of the SUV as he fires several more shots, and the car moves forward down the street before crashing into another car.",
      "The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said it was originally assigned to investigate Good's death jointly with FBI, but the state agency has since withdrawn from the case and alleged federal authorities restricted its access to evidence, CBS Minnesota reported.",
      "The BCA said the U.S. Attorney's Office \"reversed course\" and informed the agency that \"the investigation would now be led solely by the FBI.\"",

      "At 8:20 p.m. EST on Thursday, Mr. Trump\u00a0posted a graph depicting changes in private and government employment since January 2025. When the full jobs report was released Friday morning, it became clear that Mr. Trump's post had incorporated the December employment data because the totals in the chart matched figures released in the monthly report.",
      "Mr. Trump brushed off the incident. \"I don't know if they posted them,\" he told reporters Friday afternoon. \"They gave me some numbers. When people give me things, I post them.\"",
      "A White House official told CBS News that Mr. Trump's post came after he was briefed on the employment numbers, calling it an \"inadvertent public disclosure of aggregate data that was partially derived from pre-released information.\"",
      "The White House is now reviewing its protocols for economic data releases, the official added.",
      "Cooler hiring",
      "The government's latest jobs report shows that hiring cooled in December, with employers adding 50,000 jobs, while the nation's unemployment rate ticked down to 4.4%. The economy added roughly 584,000 jobs for all of 2025, down from more than 2 million in 2024, labor data shows.",
      "Federal economic data is held under strict embargo until its scheduled release because the information has the potential to move financial markets. Providing some investors with access to such data could allow them to place trades based on knowledge unavailable to other investors.",
      "White House economic officials are provided with an advance copy of the Labor Department's employment report each month on Thursday afternoon and sign agreements to keep the numbers confidential, though they also write up a summary for the president, according to the Associated Press.",

      "\"Markets don't react kindly to that, because obviously it means that perhaps a select few may have been able to front-run on that news ahead of the market at large,\" he said.",
      "Erica Groshen, a former commissioner at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unit that compiles the monthly employment figures, said that premature disclosures of the agency's data can be punished by fines and even jail time. But previous breaches typically have been met with a slap on the wrist, she noted.",
      "The Securities and Exchange Commission didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Mr. Trump's inadvertent data release.",
      "No market disruption",
      "Although some investors could have acted on the information Mr. Trump posted on Thursday, there were no evident signs of a change in trading or market prices related to the jobs data, said Adam Crisafulli, head of investment adviser Vital Knowledge.",

    "story": [
      "Two people were shot by federal agents in Portland, Oregon, on Thursday, Portland police said. The Department of Homeland Security said the shooting involved Customs and Border Patrol agents.",
      "Two people, a man and a woman, were wounded and hospitalized, Portland Police Chief Bob Day said in a news conference Thursday night.",
      "Homeland Security identified the two people Friday as Luis David Nino-Moncada and Yorlenys Betzabeth Zambrano-Contreras from Venezuela and accused them of being suspected associates with the Tren de Aragua gang. Nino-Moncada sustained an injury to the arm, DHS said, while Zambrano-Contreras was hit in the chest. Both are in stable condition, and Nino-Moncada is now in FBI custody, the agency said.",
      "The department said on social media that Nino-Moncada   entered the country illegally in 2022 and that a removal order had been issued for him. The department said Zambrano-Contreras entered the U.S. illegally in 2023.",
      "The people shot were a husband and wife, according to a statement from the PCUN farmworkers union, which is active in supporting immigrants and Latinos in the community. However, the DHS claimed the two are not married.",
      "DHS said Border Patrol agents stopped a car searching for a Venezuelan they claim is in the country illegally and a member of Tren de Aragua. Day said in a news conference Friday that the two \"do have some nexus to involvement\" with Tren de Aragua, a gang that the Trump administration has designated\u00a0a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "DHS said after the agents identified themselves, the driver \"weaponized his vehicle and attempted to run over the law enforcement agents.\"",
      "\"Fearing for his life and safety, an agent fired a defensive shot,\" DHS said. The department said the man drove off with his passenger.",
      "The shooting occurred at around 2:18 p.m. local time in the Hazelwood neighborhood in East Portland. Portland police officers responded to a 911 call and \"confirmed federal agents were involved in a shooting,\" Day said.",
      "About six minutes later, Day said, officers responded to a separate location about three miles away for a 911 call, where they found a man and woman with gunshot wounds.",
      "\"Officers determined that the two people who were injured in the shooting involving the federal agents in the earlier call,\" Day said. The two victims were then rushed to separate hospitals.",
      "\"There were federal officers both at the original scene, and federal officers met us out at the scene farther away,\" Day said.",
      "Day added that \"it's early on, we do not know the cause.\"",
      "The police chief told reporters the FBI was investigating the shooting.",
      "\"This is a federal investigation being led by the FBI,\" Day said, noting that Portland police were providing \"investigative support and perimeter support\" that was \"minimal.\"",
      "Later, Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield announced on social media that his office is opening a formal investigation into the shooting. \"Our office will take every step necessary to ensure the rights and security of Oregonians are protected,\" he said, adding that the investigation \"will look into whether any federal officer acted outside the scope of their lawful authority and will include witness interviews, video evidence, and other relevant materials.\"",
      "Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek said during the news conference, \"We are all shaken and outraged by another terrible, unnecessary violent event instigated by a reckless agenda of the Trump administration.\" She said her message to the federal government was that \"we demand transparency, we demand cooperation with Portland police and the Multnomah County DA.\"",
      "Kotek said she had not spoken to any White House officials about the incident.",
      "Hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside the ICE facility in downtown Portland as night fell. The city's police used a sound truck to warn protesters to stay off roadways and obey the law or face possible arrest and the possible use of \"impact munitions or other physical force.\" Later, they said six people were arrested for alleged misdemeanors.",
      "As of midnight Thursday, some 60-90 protesters were still there, but most were just standing around and roads were clear, CBS News' Amanda Arden reported.",
      "The shooting came a day after 37-year-old Renee Good was shot and killed by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis. DHS officials also alleged in that incident that Good had \"weaponized her vehicle,\" although Minnesota officials and video from the scene have cast doubt on that assertion.",
      "\"Our community deserves answers, our community deserves accountability, and most of all, our community deserves peace,\" Portland Mayor Keith Wilson said during the briefing.",
      "\"We cannot sit by while constitutional protections erode and bloodshed mounts,\" Wilson said in an earlier statement. \"Portland is not a 'training ground' for militarized agents, and the 'full force' threatened by the administration has deadly consequences. As Mayor, I call on ICE to end all operations in Portland until a full investigation can be completed.\"",
      "A Portland City Council session\u00a0abruptly recessed\u00a0on Thursday after members were informed of the shooting.",
      "Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden said on social media, \"Trump's deployment of federal agents in my hometown is clearly inflaming violence \u2014 and must end.\" Fellow Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley wrote on Facebook, \"Please keep protests of Trump's ICE/CBP peaceful, as Trump wants to generate riots. Don't take the bait.\"",
      "Portland has been the site of continued protests against the Trump administration's immigration crackdown for months. This fall, hundreds of National Guard troops were sent to Portland to \"protect federal assets and personnel\" carrying out immigration operations, the White House said.",
      "Mr. Trump said last week\u00a0that he was pulling National Guard troops out of Portland as well as Chicago and Los Angeles, after a federal court ruled against the administration's action. But he said, \"we will come back\" if crime \"begins to soar again.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 10 Jan 2026 23:27:28 -0500",
    "summary": "As Iran's exiled crown prince predicts his imminent return, the Islamic Republic shirks Trump's warnings and threatens protesters with maximum punishment.",
    "story": [
      "Protests in Iran raged Saturday in the Islamic Republic, online videos purported to show, despite threats from the country's theocracy to crack down on demonstrators after shutting down the internet and cutting telephone lines off to the world.",
      "The protesters appeared to be taking encouragement from repeated declarations of support by the Trump administration, and by the country's exiled crown prince, who called on them Saturday to try and overwhelm security forces and seize towns and cities.",
      "An external rights group that relies on information from contacts inside Iran says at least 116 people have been killed in the protests, which began in Tehran in late December as anger over Iran's ailing economy, but quickly spread and morphed into the most significant challenge to the government in years.",
      "Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accused President Trump of having hands \"stained with the blood of Iranians\" in remarks aired Friday on Iranian state TV, as supporters gathered before him shouted \"Death to America!\"",
      "Protesters are \"ruining their own streets ... in order to please the president of the United States,\" the 86-year-old Khamenei said to the crowd at his compound in Tehran. \"Because he said that he would come to their aid. He should pay attention to the state of his own country instead.\"",
      "Iranian state TV is reporting on security force casualties while portraying control over the nation, without discussing dead demonstrators, whom it increasingly refers to as \"terrorists.\" However, it also acknowledged protests went on into Sunday morning, with demonstrations in Tehran and in the holy city of Mashhad to the northeast.",
      "Khamenei has signaled a coming clampdown, despite U.S. warnings. Tehran escalated its threats Saturday, with the Iran's attorney general, Mohammad Movahedi Azad, warning that anyone taking part in protests will be considered an \"enemy of God,\" a death-penalty charge. The statement carried by Iranian state television said even those who \"helped rioters\" would face the charge.",
      "\"Prosecutors must carefully and without delay, by issuing indictments, prepare the grounds for the trial and decisive confrontation with those who, by betraying the nation and creating insecurity, seek foreign domination over the country,\" the statement read. \"Proceedings must be conducted without leniency, compassion or indulgence.\"",
      "Trump issues fresh warnings to Iran's leaders",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly pledged to strike Iran if protesters are killed, a threat that has taken on greater significance after the U.S. military raid that seized Venezuela's former President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. He issued a message of support to protestors on Saturday afternoon.",
      "\"Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!! President DONALD J. TRUMP,\" he wrote on Truth Social.",
      "A day earlier, Mr. Trump said that any possible American strike wouldn't \"mean boots on the ground but that means hitting them very, very hard where it hurts.\"",
      "\"Iran's in big trouble,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It looks to me that the people are taking over certain cities that nobody thought were really possible just a few weeks ago.\"",
      "He added, \"I tell the Iranian leaders you better not start shooting because we'll start shooting too.\"",
      "In a brief social media post published in the very early hours of Saturday morning in Washington, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said \"the United States supports the brave people of Iran.\"",
      "Iranian regime warns protesters will be punished \"without any legal leniency\"",
      "Iran's judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei separately vowed that punishment for protesters \"will be decisive, maximum and without any legal leniency.\"",
      "According to the Washington D.C.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which was founded by anti-regime activists, as of Saturday, the 14th day of unrest in Iran, at least 116 people had been killed, including at least 37 members of the security forces. More than 2,600 people had been arrested, and protests were recorded in at least 185 cities.",
      "The agency found that those who were killed died by live ammunition or pellet gunfire, predominantly from close range.",
      "Iranian authorities shut down the internet on Thursday night as protests escalated sharply, seemingly as people heeded a call by the exiled crown prince, a vocal opposition figure, for Iranians to raise their voices against the regime. Iranian state media has shown only pro-government demonstrations. But the few social media videos that have made it through the internet blockade tell a different story.",
      "According to an update posted online Saturday morning by the monitoring organization NetBlocks, \"metrics show the nationwide internet blackout remains in place at 36 hours, severely limiting Iranians' ability to check on the safety of friends and loved ones.\"",
      "That communications blackout has made it incredibly difficult to gain a clear picture of the scale of the protests overall \u2013 and the Iranian authorities' response to it. Some other reports put the death toll from unrest much higher, with TIME citing a doctor in Tehran as saying at least 217 people had been killed, for instance.",
      "Iranian authorities have acknowledged a few deaths, but usually only those of security forces.",
      "A doctor and medic at two hospitals in Iran told CBS News partner BBC News that their facilities were overwhelmed with injuries. The doctor said a Tehran eye hospital had gone into crisis mode, while the BBC also obtained a message from a medic in another hospital who said the facility did not have enough surgeons to handle the influx of patients. The medic claimed many of the wounded had gunshot injuries to the head and eyes.",
      "Asked by CBS News how seriously he believes Iran's autocratic rulers are taking the warnings from Mr. Trump not to kill protesters, Maziar Bahari, editor of the IranWire news website, said he was certain it had \"really scared many Iranian officials, and may have affected their actions in terms of how to confront the protestors.\"",
      "\"But at the same time ... it has inspired many protesters to come out, because they know that the leader of the world's main superpower is supporting their cause,\" said Bahari, who spent months in Iranian prisons after being arrested during a previous round of massive unrest in 2009.",
      "\"Many people have called what is happening in Iran right now a revolution,\" Bahari told CBS News' Haley Ott. \"And we can see different signs of revolution in Iran at the movement. But a revolution usually needs a leader for the revolution. But we don't have that leader.\"",
      "But while decades of draconian control over the media and the deliberate sidelining of dissident voices in the country have deprived Iran of a clear opposition figurehead inside the country's borders, many in the vast Iranian diaspora hope the nation's ousted royal family could stage a comeback.",
      "Online videos contradict state media",
      "Saturday marks the start of the work week in Iran, but many schools and universities reportedly held online classes, Iranian state TV reported. Internal Iranian government websites are believed to be functioning.",
      "State TV repeatedly played a driving, martial orchestral arrangement from the \"Epic of Khorramshahr\" by Iranian composer Majid Entezami, while showing pro-government demonstrations. The song, aired repeatedly during the 12-day war between Israel and Iran last year, honors Iran's 1982 liberation of the city of Khorramshahr during the Iran-Iraq war. It has been used in videos of protesting women cutting away their hair to protest the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini as well.",
      "Meanwhile, state television reported that \"peace prevailed in most cities of the country\" overnight, with \"no news of any gathering or chaos in Tehran and most provinces.\" That was directly contradicted by an online video verified by the Associated Press that showed demonstrations in Tehran's Saadat Abad area. Thousands gathered in the street, and one man could be heard chanting \"Death to Khamenei!\"",
      "The semiofficial Fars news agency, believed to be close to Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and one of the few media outlets able to publish to the outside world, released surveillance camera footage of what it said came from demonstrations in Isfahan. In it, a protester appeared to fire a long gun, while others set fires and threw gasoline bombs at what appeared to be a government compound.",
      "The Young Journalists' Club, associated with state TV, reported that protesters killed three members of the Guard's all-volunteer Basij force in the city of Gachsaran. It also reported a security official was stabbed to death in Hamadan province, a police officer was killed in the port city of Bandar Abbas, and another in Gilan, as well as one person was slain in Mashhad.",
      "State television also aired footage of a funeral service attended by hundreds in Qom, a Shiite seminary city just south of Tehran.",
      "Iran's theocracy cut off the nation from the internet and international telephone calls on Thursday, though it allowed some state-owned and semiofficial media to publish. Qatar's state-funded Al Jazeera news network reported live from Iran, but they appeared to be the only major foreign outlet able to work.",
      "Head of Iran's exiled royal family predicts his return is \"very near\"",
      "Iran's exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi has been seen by many analysts as a galvanizing force behind the momentum of this round of protests. On Saturday, he called on Iranians not only to continue coming out into the streets, but to try to seize control of towns and cities from the authorities by overwhelming them.",
      "\"Our goal is no longer just to take to the streets. The goal is to prepare to seize and hold city centers,\" Pahlavi said in his latest video message posted on social media, calling for more demonstrations on Saturday and Sunday.\"",
      "Striking an optimistic tone, Pahlavi declared that he was \"preparing to return to my homeland,\" suggesting the day on which he would be able to do so was \"very near.\"",
      "But Pahlavi has lived in exile for nearly 50 years, and while he has long sought to position himself as a leader-in-waiting, it's far from clear how much real support he has inside the country.",
      "His father, Iran's Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, was widely despised inside Iran when he fled into exile himself amid street protests in 1979, as the Islamic Revolution that brought the current regime to power took hold. Demonstrators have shouted in support of the shah in some protests, but it isn't clear whether that's support for Pahlavi himself or a desire to return to a time before the 1979 Islamic Revolution.",
      "Haley  Ott\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "He called for \"mediators to uphold their promises to stop the violations and work towards the safe return of the displaced to their homes.\"",

      "Syrian security forces deployed Saturday in Sheikh Maqsoud after days of clashes with Kurdish fighters that killed and wounded dozens.",

      "On Saturday afternoon, an explosive drone hit the Aleppo Governorate building shortly after two Cabinet ministers and a local official held a news conference on the developments in the city. There was no immediate word on casualties.",
      "Syria's state TV aired footage showing a drone exploding as it slammed into the building and blamed Kurdish fighters for the attack. The SDF denied the reports, saying its fighters did not attack a civilian target.",
      "The fighting between the two sides is the most intense since the fall of then-President Bashar Assad in December 2024. At least 22 people were killed in five days of clashes and more than 140,000 were displaced.",

      "He said recent developments in Aleppo were \"deeply concerning,\" and Washington's objective \"remains a sovereign, unified Syria \u2014 at peace with itself and its neighbors \u2014 where equality, justice, and opportunity are extended to all its people.\"",

Security forces have since captured Achrafieh and Bani Zaid.",
      "Kurdish forces said at least 12 civilians were killed in the Kurdish-majority neighborhoods in the five days of fighting, while government officials reported at least 10 civilians were killed in the surrounding government-controlled areas.",

    "published": "Sat, 10 Jan 2026 19:51:16 -0500",
    "summary": "Many Iranian opposition activists are hoping the current unrest could be the beginning of the end of the country's hardline Islamic regime.",
    "story": [
      "Iran has faced intense nationwide protests for two weeks, marking the largest challenge to the country's ruling regime in years \u2014 and drawing vows from President Trump to intervene on the protesters' behalf if they face a violent crackdown.",
      "Initially sparked by Iran's economic freefall and severe inflation, the protests have boiled over, with about 185 cities facing demonstrations. One monitoring group has reported thousands of arrests and more than 100 deaths since the protests began.",
      "Here's what you need to know:",
      "How the Iran protests started, and what they've become",
      "The current wave of protests began in the capital, Tehran, in late December as shopkeepers went on strike and marched into the streets. Small business owners in Iran have long been seen as supportive of the regime, but anger over spiraling inflation and the devaluation of the nation's currency, which lost more than 40% of its value last year, making everyday goods impossible for many people to afford, sparked the demonstrations.",
      "The protests quickly spread, with people joining marches across the country to denounce not only the economic woes, but to air wider discontent with the country's hardline regime.",
      "As of Saturday, protests were reported in at least 185 cities in all 31 of the country's provinces, according to the Human Rights Activists News Agency, or HRANA, a U.S.-based monitoring group founded by anti-regime activists.",
      "Demonstrations have also been reported on dozens of university campuses since late December, and strikes and shop closures were reported in markets in over a dozen cities, HRANA said.",
      "Videos posted on social media virtually every night have shown crowds of protesters marching through the streets of various Iranian cities, chanting anti-government slogans and clashing with the country's security forces in some cases.",
      "How Iranian authorities have responded",
      "More than 2,600 people have been reported detained since the wave of protests began, including at least 167 under the age of 18, according to HRANA. Some 116 people have been killed, the group said, including at least seven people under the age of 18 and 37 members of the security services.",
      "The group found that most victims \"were killed by live ammunition or pellet gunfire, predominantly from close range.\"",
      "Iran's attorney general on Jan. 10 warned that anyone taking part in the protests would be considered an \"enemy of God,\" according to The Associated Press, a death-penalty charge.",
      "The Islamic Republic's semiofficial Fars news agency had\u00a0claimed on Jan. 5\u00a0that about 250 police officers and 45 members of the feared Basij security force had been injured amid the unrest.",
      "Iranian authorities cut off phone service and web access Thursday night across the country, according to the internet monitoring organization NetBlocks, which said a \"nationwide internet blackout\" continued on Friday.",
      "\"Even Starlink, which has been the main line of communication for some activists in different parts of the country, has been jammed,\" Maziar Bahari, editor of the independent IranWire news site, told CBS News on Friday, referring to the satellite communication system run by Elon Musk.",
      "CBS News has sought comment from SpaceX, which runs Starlink, but did not get any immediate response.",
      "Trump warns he'll hit Iran \"very hard\" if it kills protesters",
      "Mr. Trump has threatened on several occasions since the protests began that he could order a U.S. intervention if Iranian authorities kill demonstrators.",
      "\"Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!,\" the president wrote on Truth Social on Jan. 10.",
      "Speaking at the White House on Jan. 9, Mr. Trump reiterated that he was open to some kind of U.S. action, although he said that would not involve a U.S. incursion.",
      "\"I've made the statement very strongly that if they start killing people like they have in the past, we will get involved,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We'll be hitting them very hard where it hurts. And that doesn't mean boots on the ground, but it means hitting them very, very hard where it hurts. So, we don't want that to happen.\"",
      "In a Jan. 2 post on Truth Social, he said: \"If Iran [shoots] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\"",
      "\"We are locked and loaded and ready to go,\" the president said.",
      "Speaking on Fox News on Jan. 8, Mr. Trump said the U.S. was \"ready\" to hit Iran hard if protesters were killed, but added, \"for the most part, they haven't\" been.",
      "The president's comments came just over six months after he ordered airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, amid a deadly days-long conflict between Iran and Israel.",
      "The unrest in Iran also comes as Mr. Trump takes a more aggressive posture on the world stage.",
      "U.S. forces captured former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in an overnight military operation in Caracas on Jan. 3, and Mr. Trump has suggested he's open to military action in Colombia to combat drug trafficking, and even to take control of Greenland.",
      "Alex Vatanka, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute who studies Iran, told CBS News last week that Mr. Trump's gestures of support could embolden Iranian protesters, saying his comments may be the \"one ingredient you need to keep \u2026 the street-level movement alive.\"",
      "Bahari, of IranWire, said Iranian officials had told him they were concerned about Mr. Trump potentially intervening in Iran even before the protests began.",
      "The recent U.S. attack on Venezuela, \"has really scared many Iranian officials and may have affected their actions in terms of how to confront the protesters. But at the same time, it has inspired many protesters to come out, because they know that the leader of the world's main superpower is supporting their cause.\"",
      "Iranian leaders acknowledge problems, but blame U.S.",
      "In an address on state television aired Friday, after an intense night of protests, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed that his regime would \"not back down,\" called for unity and accused \"a bunch of vandals\" in Tehran of causing chaos in the capital \"to please the U.S. president.\"",
      "In some cases, Iranian officials have attempted to strike a conciliatory tone, acknowledging people's economic concerns and insisting that people have the right to protest peacefully. State media reported that President Masoud Pezeshkian had directed security forces not to crack down on peaceful protesters.",
      "The government has also offered some relief in the form of $7-a-month stipends that can be used in grocery stores to buy basic necessities.",
      "Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has condemned Mr. Trump threats of a U.S. intervention, accusing the U.S. of \"inciting violence and terrorism.\"",
      "Iranian army commander Major General Amir Hatami threatened Wednesday to \"cut off the hand of any aggressor.\"",
      "Iran's history of mass protests",
      "Protests \u2014 and severe crackdowns \u2014 are a recurring theme in Iran.",
      "The last major round of protests came in 2022, spurred by the death in police custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was arrested by the theocratic government's forces for allegedly wearing her headscarf incorrectly. Hundreds of people were killed across months of demonstrations.",
      "Other protest movements came in 2019 and 2017, and Iran was beset by a large-scale uprising in 2009 over the country's contested presidential election.",
      "\"From what we saw on social media channels and also from conversations with different people in Iran, the number of protesters in different parts of the country is not as high as in 2022, but there are more protests \u2014   the protests are more widespread in different parts of the country,\" Bahari told CBS News. \"So, even some smaller cities where they never had a protest in those cities, they see protests these days, and I think people are more desperate than before.\"",
      "The current protests seem different compared to the previous rounds \u2014   and could be harder for the regime to quell by offering concessions \u2014 due to their roots in the country's economic woes, according to Mona Yacoubian, Director and Senior Adviser of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "She noted that in 2022, the regime was able to appease protesters by \"simply addressing their complaints about women's veiling and so forth.\"",
      "But the protesters now are more focused on economic problems, and \"there's really nothing [the regime] can do\" to get Iran's moribund economy back on track, she said.",
      "\"These protests, they are about economic situation, but also about dignity,\" Bahari told CBS News. \"It's about the national pride. And because of that, this protest will be very, very difficult to contain.\"",
      "Iranian Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi cheers on the protests",
      "Iranian Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, whose father the former shah, fled just before the 1979 Islamic Revolution that brought the current clerical regime to power, has cheered the protests from exile, urging demonstrators this week to keep the movement \"disciplined\" and \"as large as possible.\"",
      "The crown prince called for Iranians to chant together against the country's leadership at 8 p.m. local time, or 12 p.m. Eastern, on Jan. 8 and Jan. 9, and many did seem to answer his call.",
      "\"Our goal is no longer just to take to the streets. The goal is to prepare to seize and hold city centers,\" Pahlavi said in a video message on Jan. 9.",
      "Pahlavi's call to action \"could be a turning point\" in the protest movement, Yacoubian told CBS News on Thursday.",
      "\"This is a regime that is not afraid to use lethal force,\" Yacoubian said. \"But the question is, to what extent, if they become overwhelmed, if the protests become overwhelmingly large and if there are elements in security forces, police, and so forth, kind of at that local level, who themselves are suffering the effects of this economic crisis and who decide not to shoot at people: These are the kinds of questions I think that we need to watch.\"",

      "A representative for Machado did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.",
      "The statement comes after Machado indicated she'd like to give or share the prize with Mr. Trump, who oversaw the successful U.S. operation to capture authoritarian Venezuelan president\u00a0Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. He is facing drug trafficking charges in New York.",
      "\"I certainly would love to be able to personally tell him that we believe \u2014 the Venezuelan people, because this is a prize of the Venezuelan people \u2014 certainly want to, to give it to him and share it with him,\" Machado told Fox News host\u00a0Sean Hannity earlier this week. \"What he has done is historic.

NATO allies and Greenland have disagreed with Mr. Trump's assessment.",
      "\"If we don't do it the easy way, we're going to do it the hard way,\" Mr. Trump said, without explaining what that entailed. The White House stated that it is considering a range of options, including the use of military force, to acquire the island.

    "story": [
      "The leader of an independent Iranian news publication says that President Trump's warnings are alarming officials in the Middle Eastern country and encouraging protesters as the largest demonstrations in years sweep the nation.",
      "Iran's Judiciary Chief has warned that protesters will face the \"maximum\" punishment, and the country's attorney general said that anyone taking part in protests will be considered an \"enemy of God,\" a death-penalty charge, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Mr. Trump has said that the United States will respond if demonstrators are killed. He repeated his warning on Friday, telling Iranian leaders not to attack protesters. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said online early Saturday that the \"United States supports the brave people of Iran.\" On Saturday afternoon, Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social that \"Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!\"",
      "\"I'm sure that has really scared many Iranian officials and may have affected their actions in terms of how to confront the protestors, but at the same time, it has inspired many protesters to come out because they know that the leader of the world's main superpower is supporting their cause,\" said Maziar Bahari, the editor of the independent news site Iranwire.",
      "The demonstrations began in Tehran two weeks ago as a response to Iran's crashing currency and failing economy. Holly Dagres, a non-resident senior fellow at the Washington Institute and curator of the Iranist newsletter, said the protests were sparked by the same core issues of \"systemic mismanagement, corruption or repression\" that led to the uprisings after the death of Mahsa Amini, who was killed by Iran's morality police in 2022.",
      "Since then, they have grown across the country, with thousands filling the streets. Human rights groups say at least 65 people have been killed, while at least two hospitals in Tehran reported being inundated with patients.",
      "State media in Iran called the protesters terrorists, while Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made a public address\u00a0on Friday, accusing Iranians of ruining their own streets to please the president of the United States. Officials cut off the country's internet\u00a0on Thursday, effectively shutting off Iran from the outside world.",
      "Dagris said Internet access was cut \"because the Islamic Republic didn't want the international community and fellow Iranians to see what was happening.\"",
      "\"I think there's a real worry that with the internet shutdown, the international community won't pay attention and that the events on the ground will deteriorate,\" said Dagres, who grew up in Iran.",
      "She said she was not certain Mr. Trump's warnings would deter a crackdown.",
      "\"Unfortunately, this is a regime that's been in power for 47 years and it has not changed its behavior, nor will it because the president of the United States makes a threat,\" Dagres said. \"And we're hearing that and seeing that already with what's been playing out ... This is an Islamic Republic that's backed in the corner, and it's lashing out. And that's just what they do best, unfortunately: Brutal crackdowns.\"",
      "Bahari said that \"many people have called what is happening in Iran right now a revolution,\" but noted that there is no opposition leader to coalesce around.",
      "Reza Pahlavi, the son of the former shah, who was overthrown in January 1979, has been encouraging protesters over social media and saying he is preparing to return to the country, but it's unclear how much support he actually has inside Iran.",

      "\"If a vehicle's stolen in the middle of the night, and the victim does not wake up till 7 in the morning, well if it's stolen at 2, you have roughly five hours to transport that vehicle,\" Navarro said. \"If that vehicle's not reported in the system, and it passes through that camera, then no, it's not going to be alerted at all.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 09 Jan 2026 23:13:13 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump has said Venezuela \"unilaterally seized and sold American oil.\" But the history between the countries is far more complicated, experts note.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump announced the capture of former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife on Saturday, he justified the military operation in part by framing it as a move to recover assets that he claims had been stolen from U.S. companies.",
      "\"Venezuela unilaterally seized and sold American oil, American assets and American platforms, costing us billions and billions of dollars,\" Mr. Trump said. \"This constituted one of the largest thefts of American property in the history of our country.\"",
      "Who owns Venezuela's oil?",
      "The president's focus on Venezuela's oil is now raising questions about American energy companies' activities in the country, as well as whether U.S. oil giants might now work to revive its floundering petroleum industry. Venezuela's\u00a0constitution\u00a0states that the nation owns all mineral and hydrocarbon deposits \u2014 its oil and natural gas reserves \u2014 within its own territory, including those that lie beneath the country's seabed.",
      "Mr. Trump \"talks about them taking our oil \u2014 the oil itself was never 'our oil',\" Samantha Gross, director of the energy security and climate initiative at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, told CBS News, adding that the nation's vast crude reserves \"belong to the government of Venezuela.\"",
      "What's also true, however, is that U.S. oil companies had contractual agreements with Venezuela to extract, process and transport its oil, as well as to share in the revenue from oil sales.",
      "Mr. Trump's claims of theft reflect actions by then-Venezuela leader Hugo Ch\u00e1vez to nationalize the nation's energy sector in 2007 and to confiscate the production assets of Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips after they left the country, Gross said.",
      "Those seizures have led to years of lawsuits and efforts by the companies to recoup their losses. While a World Bank arbitration panel has ruled in favor of the oil companies, the money has yet to be recovered.",
      "\"It is beyond question that there are a number of U.S. companies and others out there who have claims against Venezuela that have been trying to get those claims satisfied for many years,\" Ted Posner, a partner at law firm Baker Botts and a former assistant general counsel for international affairs at the U.S. Department of the Treasury, told CBS News.",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Oil industry executives met on Friday afternoon at the White House with Mr. Trump, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright to discuss Venezuela. Representatives from Exxon, Chevron and ConocoPhillips attended, including ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance.",
      "\"ConocoPhillips continues to monitor developments in Venezuela and their potential implications for global energy supply and stability,\" the company said in a statement prior to the meeting.",
      "Said a Chevron spokesperson after the meeting on Friday: \"For more than a century, Chevron has been a part of Venezuela's past. We remain committed to its present. And we stand ready to help it build a better future while strengthening U.S. energy and regional security.\"",
      "Exxon didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "Ch\u00e1vez's power play \u2014 and corruption",
      "Venezuela's government has a long history of nationalizing its oil sector, with state oil company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela S.A., or PDVSA, taking over the industry in the 1970s. Exxon and other foreign oil companies continued to operate in the country by signing contracts to provide technical assistance and other expertise to PDVSA.",
      "In the 1990s, Exxon and other large petroleum companies were invited by then-Venezuelan President Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez to return in an effort to develop the oil reserves in the Orinoco River Basin, according to \"Energy in the Americas,\" a book published by the University of Calgary Press.",
      "But in 2003, Ch\u00e1vez fired thousands of PDVSA workers after they went on strike. Four years later, he expanded the nationalization push by requiring foreign companies to give majority ownership of their ventures to PDVSA. Exxon and ConocoPhillips failed to strike a deal with Venezuela, while BP, Houston-based Chevron, Norway's Statoil and France's Total signed pacts giving majority stakes to PDVSA, allowing them to remain, Reuters reported in 2007.",
      "\"Some agreed, and some did not, and assets were expropriated,\" Gross said.",
      "Amid widespread corruption under Ch\u00e1vez, as journalist Anne Appelbaum noted in a 2024 book, hundreds of billions of dollars were siphoned off from PDVSA and other Venezuelan companies and subsequently disappeared into private bank accounts around the world.",
      "A 2017 investigation by U.S. and Portuguese authorities found that PDVSA executives had funneled millions of dollars into Portugal's Banco Espirito Santo.",
      "Venezuela owes billions to Big Oil",
      "Ch\u00e1vez's strong-arm tactics led to efforts by Exxon and ConocoPhillips to seek compensation for their assets, with Exxon claiming it had lost $16.6 billion due to the nationalization campaign. A World Bank arbitration panel in 2014 awarded the company one-tenth of what it had sought, but that same body later\u00a0annulled most of that award.",
      "In a separate case, an international tribunal\u00a0ruled that Venezuela owed $8.7 billion to ConocoPhillips in compensation for the 2007 seizure of its assets.",
      "Other industries also had their assets taken away under Ch\u00e1vez's 14-year reign, and companies have filed at least 60 arbitration claims against Venezuela since the 2000s, according to Luisa Palacios, an adjunct senior research scholar at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy.",
      "\"The value of these liabilities is estimated at $20 to $30 billion or about 10% to 15% of the almost $200 billion in international debt obligations Venezuela owes,\" she said in an article this week published by Columbia.",
      "\"Venezuela could pay off these claims by inviting investors back to the country,\" she noted. \"That could be done through debt-for-equity swaps or by linking future oil production to repayment of current debts. However, restructuring the country's foreign obligations will likely be needed for Venezuela to fully realize its oil potential.\"",
      "U.S. wasting no time",
      "Venezuela's oil reserves\u00a0are estimated to be the world's largest, with more than 303 billion barrels. That represents about 17% of the world's total oil supply, according to OPEC\u00a0data.",
      "But Venezuela's crude oil production has plunged, with the industry today pumping 800,000 to 1 million barrels per day, down from more than 3 million per day in the early 2000s. That output has nosedived due to chronic underinvestment, government mismanagement, and the impact of U.S. and international sanctions.",
      "On Wednesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the U.S. will export between 30 million and 50 million barrels of oil from Venezuela, which will be sold at \"market rates,\" with revenue used \"in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Venezuela's interim government had agreed to release the oil.",
      "Although Mr. Trump is pushing U.S. oil companies to invest in Venezuela following Maduro's capture, they may need assurances before committing to new ventures, Gross said.",
      "\"The political situation in Venezuela is really uncertain right now. Before a company is going to realistically invest a lot of money, they will want a stable political situation,\" she added.",
      "Edited by\n                                        \n                                  Alain  Sherter",

      "It was impossible to get a clear picture of the extent of the unrest, given the clamp down on the flow of information. But Iran's ruler appeared in a brief television address on Friday morning, defiantly accusing President Trump of inspiring the protests, showing he remained in charge, and vowing that his regime would \"not back down.\"",
      "Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 86, called for unity and accused \"a bunch of vandals\" in Tehran, where a state TV building was set alight, of having \"destroyed a building that belongs to them to please the U.S. president.\"",
      "As he spoke, an audience in front of him shouted the familiar refrain of \"Death to America!\"",
      "Given the communications blackout, which continued Friday morning according to the NetBlocks internet monitoring organization, short videos posted online, largely by anti-regime activists, provided the only real window into the chaos across the country.",
      "It appeared to ramp up dramatically from 8 p.m. local time on Thursday, the moment at which exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi had urged Iranians to shout and chant from their windows against the regime.",
      "\"Iranians demanded their freedom tonight,\" said Pahlavi, the son of the former head of state Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who fled the country just before the 1979 Islamic revolution that brought the current regime to power.",
      "In statements posted online, he called for European leaders to join Mr. Trump to \"hold the regime to account,\" using \"all technical, financial, and diplomatic resources available to restore communication to the Iranian people so that their voice and their will can be heard and seen. Do not let the voices of my courageous compatriots be silenced.\"",
      "Speaking at the White House Friday, Mr. Trump reiterated, as he has in recent days, that he was open to some kind of U.S.\u00a0 intervention in Iran, although he said that would not involve a U.S. incursion.",
      "\"I've made the statement very strongly that if they start killing people like they have in the past, we will get involved,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We'll be hitting them very hard where it hurts. And that doesn't mean boots on the ground, but it means hitting them very, very hard where it hurts. So, we don't want that to happen.\"",
      "On Friday, Pahlavi made a direct appeal to Mr. Trump.",
      "\"I have called the people to the streets to fight for their freedom and to overwhelm the security forces with sheer numbers. Last night they did that. Your threat to this criminal regime has also kept the regime's thugs at bay. But time is of the essence. The people will be on the streets again in an hour. I am asking you to help,\" Pahlavi said on social media. \"You have proven and I know you are a man of peace and a man of your word. Please be prepared to intervene to help the people of Iran.\"",
      "Pahlavi issued his initial call several days earlier for mass chanting against the regime at 8 p.m., which is noon on the East Coast of the United States, on both Thursday and Friday.",
      "In the videos, which are difficult to independently verify, many people could be heard chanting \"Death to the dictator!\" and \"Death to the Islamic Republic,\" while others called for a return of the monarchy, declaring: \"Pahlavi will return!\"",
      "As of Thursday, the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which relies on a network of contacts inside the country, said at least 42 people had been killed and more than 2,270 others detained, but that was before a clear picture could be gained of the chaos on Thursday night and Friday morning.",
      "\"All of the huge crowds in my neighborhood are pro-Pahlavi and from several areas my sources report the same \u2014 pro-Pahlavi crowds are prevailing, undeniably,\" one source in Tehran told CBS News on Thursday night, calling it \"monarchists responding to Reza,\" before his communications were cut off.",
      "\"For the first time, the government decided to shut the internet yesterday, and usually when they shut the Internet, it means that they're going to use violence against people,\" Maziar Bahari, editor of the independent IranWire news site, told CBS News on Friday.",
      "Bahari said activists and journalists outside Iran had heard reports of security forces shooting at people in different parts of the country, but that the information was impossible to verify. Other CBS News sources, both people inside the country and those in contact with family in Iran, said there did not appear to have been massive, widespread violence on Thursday evening, but they stressed that it was difficult to get a clear picture amid the communications cuts.",
      "\"Even Starlink, which has been the main line of communication for some activists in different parts of the country, has been jammed,\" Bahari said, referring to the satellite communication system run by Elon Musk.",
      "CBS News has sought comment from SpaceX, which runs Starlink, but did not get any immediate response.",
      "Bahari said this would likely result in the \"incarceration of hundreds or even thousands of protesters. It's gonna lead to torture and interrogation of thousands of protestors, into killing of the protestors. But it has not prevented protests in the past. People have continued to protest, and this time, because the middle classes - the traditional bazaar merchants - they have joined the young people, I think the protests, it will be very difficult for the regime to stop.\"",
      "How might Iran respond?",
      "\"Many people have called what is happening in Iran right now a revolution, and we can see different signs of revolution in Iran at the moment, but a revolution usually needs a leader for the revolution \u2026 We don't have that leader,\" said Bahari, who was working as a journalist in Iran in 2009 when a previous round of massive protests swept across the country. He was arrested and detained for over 100 days.",
      "He said he expects the protests to continue, regardless of any steps the regime takes to crack down, which he said could vary significantly based on the whims of local and regional commanders.",
      "\"I think people are more desperate than before. In 2009, the economic situation was not as bad as it is now,\" Bahari said. \"In 2009 the protests were really about dignity and citizen rights. In 2022, the 'woman life freedom' [movement] was mainly about the rights of women to determine their own destinies. But I think these protests, they are about the economic situation, but also about dignity. It's about the national pride. And because of that, these protests will be very, very difficult to contain.\"",
      "\"I was very lucky that I was a journalist for a foreign publication at that time \u2026 and because of that, I wasn't treated the same way that unknown prisoners were treated,\" Bahari told CBS News.",
      "But despite his status as \"a VIP prisoner,\" Bahari said he was \"tortured physically. I was tortured psychologically. I was threatened with execution. And I know for a fact that many of the protesters in 2009 who were arrested with me and did not have my profile, they were treated much more harshly by the prison guards in different parts of the country.\"",
      "\"Iranian people, they do not lack bravery. They lack leadership in terms of opposing the government,\" Bahari said. \"But at the same time, many of the protesters, they have nothing to lose. Their rate of suicide in the past couple of decades in Iran is really high. And when you're suicidal, when you have nothing to lose, you don't care about what may happen to you in a protest. So you just come out and ask for your rights.\"",
      "Echoing Khamenei, Iran's state-controlled media on Friday accused \"terrorist agents\" of the U.S. and Israel of causing the violence. It acknowledged casualties, but gave no details.",
      "The protests began on December 28 as merchants in Tehran closed their shops and took to the streets to vent anger over Iran's long-ailing economy, which has been hobbled for years by global isolation and a raft of sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other nations over its nuclear program and backing of armed proxy groups across the region.",
      "Iran's autocratic regime has quashed several previous waves of unrest, violently, and the source in Tehran told CBS News there was significant fear among many people that the current protests would draw a similar draconian crackdown.",
      "This time, however, the protests are playing out under the threat of a direct U.S. intervention by President Trump.",
      "\"I have let them know that if they start killing people, which they tend to do during their riots \u2014 they have lots of riots \u2014 if they do it, we are going to hit them very hard,\" Mr. Trump said Thursday during a radio interview.",
      "Vice President JD Vance told reporters at the White House that the U.S. stood by anyone engaged in peaceful protests in Iran. Asked if the U.S. would, as it did over the summer, join in any new Israeli strikes on Iran, Vance called on Tehran to negotiate with Washington over its nuclear program, but said he would \"let the president speak to what we're going to do in the future.\"",
      "Bahari said that Iranian officials had told him they were concerned about Mr. Trump potentially intervening in Iran even before these protests.",
      "The recent U.S. attack on Venezuela, \"has really scared many Iranian officials and may have affected their actions in terms of how to confront the protesters. But at the same time, it has inspired many protesters to come out, because they know that the leader of the world's main superpower is supporting their cause.\"",

      "His wife Jessica, the other co-owner of the bar, was allowed to remain free under judicial supervision, Pilloud's office said.",
      "The Morettis, who co-own Le Constellation bar in the Swiss ski-resort of Crans-Montana, were interviewed by prosecutors in Switzerland's southwestern Wallis canton as the country held a national day of mourning for the 40 people killed in last week's disaster.

      "Entering the enclosed space, Mekrabech delicately placed the roses.",
      "\"I brought 40. One for each of the victims,\" he told AFP.",
      "Eight days on from the tragedy at Le Constellation in Crans-Montana, which left 40 dead and 116 injured, Switzerland marked a national day of mourning for the mostly teenage victims.",
      "Mekrabech, 30, had come from Lyon, in neighboring France. He was one of many who traveled from afar to mark the occasion in the snow-blanketed ski resort where the tragedy occurred.",
      "\"I'm someone who likes to party quite a bit. It made me think of myself. I thought, I could have been at a party without paying attention and been trapped like that,\" he said. \"I saw myself ... I felt I had to make the gesture.\"",
      "He and others said they would watch the national memorial ceremony, being live-streamed on giant screens in Crans-Montana from Martigny, down the Rhone valley. Several heads of state from the European nations that had citizens killed in the blaze attended the service.",
      "At the Crans-Montana congress center, which was used in the days after the tragedy to accommodate family members desperately seeking information about their missing loved ones, around 1,400 people gathered to view the ceremony, many sobbing quietly.",
      "When first responders filed in, making their way to around 100 reserved seats, they were met with a standing ovation.",
      "Nicolas Dobler, a 38-year-old volunteer fireman in the northwest Swiss canton of Jura, said he had come with three colleagues to light candles at the memorial.",

      "He knelt down and seemed to pray among the flowers, before straightening his glasses and re-emerging, his eyes filled with tears.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/denmarks-former-nato-ambassador-slams-trumps-bid-to-takeover-greenland-as-american-imperialism/",
    "published": "Fri, 09 Jan 2026 14:57:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Veteran diplomat tells CBS News Denmark \"ready to cooperate\" on Greenland, and he expects U.S. to abandon \"anachronistic approach of colonialism\" post-Trump.",
    "story": [
      "Denmark's former ambassador to NATO, veteran diplomat Michael Zilmer-Johns, had tough words for the Trump administration as Danish and American officials prepare to discuss the future of the small European nation's semi-autonomous territory of Greenland.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said he'll meet Danish officials next week, but he has not specified where or when. While Zlimer-Johns was critical of the Trump administration's stated intention to make the world's largest, strategically located island part of the U.S., he spoke pragmatically and hopefully about the future of the U.S.-Denmark relationship, and the future of the transatlantic NATO alliance that the U.S. has led for decades.",
      "Below are the highlights of CBS News' interview with the Danish diplomat.",
      "CBS News: About all this talk from the White House about taking Greenland, how do you feel?",
      "Michael Zilmer-Johns: Well, I was shocked, like I think almost every Dane and every Greenlander,, because the U.S. has, in our view, everything it needs for its security in Greenland. There's a huge base there. It has the potential to build up. We have a defense agreement specifically about Greenland, with the US dating back to the year 1951.",
      "I'm angry because I think that this is an affront to an ally that has stood up with the U.S. in Afghanistan, in Iraq, all over the world. Wherever they asked us to participate, we did. So I think it's totally ungrateful.",
      "CBS News: The Prime Minister, Mette Frederiksen, warned if Trump attacked Denmark to take Greenland, it would be the end of NATO. In her words, \"everything stops, including NATO, and thus the security that has been established since the end of the Second World War.\" As Denmark's former top representative to NATO, to what extent do you fear the end of NATO?\"",
      "Zilmer-Johns: I'm worried, but I am still confident that at the end of the day, better counsels will prevail, that we will find some kind of agreement with the Trump administration on Greenland so that NATO can continue as it should. It will be a very different NATO, anyhow, because it's clear that the Americans are withdrawing from Europe and Europe is going to step up. So it will be more European NATO in the future. But hopefully we can keep it together.\"",
      "CBS News: There has been criticism that a potential U.S. use of military force would basically be a NATO member against another NATO member in the nearly 80 years of the existence of this alliance. In your opinion, would the use of U.S. military force trigger Article 5, (my addition: the mutual defense clause that states an attack on one member is an attack on all 32 NATO nations)?",
      "Zilmer-Johns: I mean it's of course absurd to have such a situation where two NATO countries would be in a military conflict. If it was an outside power that did this to Denmark, then of course that would trigger Article 5. In a situation where it's the strongest member of NATO that would attack small Denmark, I think that this would be something where NATO could not engage because it's a conflict inside NATO and not between NATO and the foreign power.",
      "I still find it very difficult to imagine that we would see actual fighting between Danish soldiers and Americans. But of course, the Danish soldiers in Greenland have a standing order to defend the territory against any aggression.",
      "But should it happen, then at the end of the day, I think that the Danish government would tell the Danish troops to stand down because, of course, a military conflict between the world's greatest military power and small Denmark, that is an inevitable result.",
      "CBS News: Would an independent Greenland be able to defend itself against security issues, strategic adversaries? Here, China, Russia, as the White House, as President Trump has said?\"",
      "Zilmer-Johns: Greenland has a population of 60,000 people. It's a huge land mass, the size of most of Western Europe, so of course it could not do that alone. It would need a stronger partner. It could be Denmark, it could be the US, but the Greenlanders themselves have said that if they - and when they should - become independent, they will continue to be a member of NATO.",
      "CBS News: Right after World War II, the United States offered roughly $100 million in gold to buy Greenland from Denmark at that time. Right now, with inflation, that goes up to about $12-13 billion. What do you feel about that number as applied to Greenland in terms of its value?",
      "Zilmer-Johns: I think the whole principle of selling Greenland is out of the question. That's the thing that could happen in a different age where there were a lot of colonial powers and Greenland was a colony at that time and there were British colonies all over Africa. And we had sold the West Indies Islands to the Americans in 1916. So at that stage, it was not something that would be inconceivable. But today, with the status that Greenland has, it is simply not on the table. So whatever the amount would be, it would never be realistic, or something that anybody in Greenland could imagine.",
      "CBS News: Is the White House being imperial in its ambitions?",
      "Zilmer-Johns: I think that you could put it that way. When you look at the new security strategy, when you look what President Trump is saying about the Western Hemisphere and the need for control and the needs to expand the U.S., that sounds very much like imperialism in my eye.",
      "Traditionally, America was at the forefront of decolonization and making the Europeans give up their colonies, forcing them to do so or putting pressure to do. I do not think that this approach will continue after President Trump. Even if his MAGA movement or the Republicans should continue to control the White House. I think it's very much Trump's personal approach, this anachronistic approach of colonialism, more imperialism.",
      "CBS News: Is there anything else you would like to add in any talking points? A message for President Trump, a message for Americans?",
      "Zilmer-Johns: I would like to say that we are ready to cooperate with America in all aspects of ensuring the legitimate security interests in and around Greenland. And we would invite you to do so. Thank you very much.",

    "published": "Fri, 09 Jan 2026 12:51:43 -0500",
    "summary": "Scientists say all signs indicate the so-called \"megaberg\" could be just days or weeks from totally disintegrating.",
    "story": [
      "One of the largest and oldest icebergs ever tracked by scientists has turned blue and is \"on the verge of complete disintegration,\" NASA said on Thursday.",
      "A23a, a massive wall of ice that was once twice the size of Rhode Island, is drenched in blue meltwater as it drifts in the South Atlantic off the eastern tip of South America, NASA said in a news release.",
      "A NASA satellite captured an image of the fading berg the day after Christmas, showing pools of blue meltwater on its surface. A day later, an astronaut aboard the International Space Station captured a photograph showing a closer view of the iceberg, with an even larger melt pool.",
      "The satellite image suggests that the A23a has also \"sprung a leak,\" NASA said, as the weight of the water pooling at the top of the berg punched through the ice.",
      "Scientists say all signs indicate the so-called \"megaberg\" could be just days or weeks from totally disintegrating as it rides currents that are pushing it toward even warmer waters. Warmer air temperatures during this season could also speed up A23a's demise in an area that ice experts have dubbed a \"graveyard\" for icebergs.",
      "\"I certainly don't expect A-23A to last through the austral summer,\" \u00a0retired University of Maryland, Baltimore County scientist Chris Shuman said in a statement.",
      "Blue and white linear patterns visible on A23a are likely related to striations, which are ridges that were scoured hundreds of years ago when the iceberg was part of the Antarctic bedrock, NASA said.",
      "\"The striations formed parallel to the direction of flow, which ultimately created subtle ridges and valleys on the top of the iceberg that now direct the flow of meltwater,\" said Walt Meier, a senior research scientist at the National Snow & Ice Data Center.",
      "When the berg detached from Antarctica in 1986, it was about 4,000 square kilometers and hosted a Soviet research station. It remained stuck for over 30 years before finally breaking free in 2020, its slow journey north sometimes held up by ocean forces that stopped its movement.",
      "In 2023, the British Antarctic Survey posted a\u00a0time-lapse of satellite imagery, showing the iceberg's movement. In January 2025, it was on a collision course with a remote penguin colony but fortunately, it did not make impact.",
      "Last summer, multiple large chunks of ice broke off A23a as it moved into relatively warm summer conditions. According to current estimates\u00a0from the U.S. National Ice Center, in early January 2026, the berg's area is 1,182 square kilometers -- still larger than New York City but a fraction of its initial size.",
      "\"I'm incredibly grateful that we've had the satellite resources in place that have allowed us to track it and document its evolution so closely,\" said Shuman. \"A-23A faces the same fate as other Antarctic bergs, but its path has been remarkably long and eventful. It's hard to believe it won't be with us much longer.\"",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014 U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Thursday that he wants \"all options to be on the table,\" including a potential ban on Elon Musk's X platform in Britain, over the use of its artificial intelligence tool Grok to generate sexualized images of people without their consent.",
      "Starmer's remarks come as Musk's platform faces scrutiny from regulators across the globe over Grok's image editing tool, which has allowed users to create digitally altered, sexualized photos of real people,\u00a0including minors.",
      "\"This is disgraceful, it's disgusting and it's not to be tolerated. X has got to get a grip of this,\" Starmer said in an interview with a U.K. radio station. \"It's unlawful. We're not going to tolerate it. I've asked for all options to be on the table.\"",
      "A source in Starmer's office reiterated to CBS News on Friday that \"nothing is off the table\" when it comes to regulating X in Britain.",
      "CBS News has verified that Grok fulfilled user requests asking it to edit images of women to show them in bikinis or little clothing, including prominent public figures such as\u00a0first lady Melania Trump.",
      "Last week, Grok, a chatbot developed by Musk's company xAI, acknowledged \"lapses in safeguards\" that allowed users to generate digitally altered, sexualized photos of minors.",
      "Grok told users that as of Friday, access to its image generation tool was limited \"to paying subscribers\" of its user verification service. Paying subscribers have to provide their credit card and personal details to the company, which could dissuade some people from using the service, especially if they had intended to use Grok's AI tool to create illegal images of minors.",
      "xAI responded to a CBS News request for comment to criticism of Grok's image generation tool and steps it had taken to limit access to it on Friday, by saying: \"Legacy media lies.\"",
      "Addressing reporters on Friday morning, a U.K. government spokesperson called the move to limit access to Grok's image editing tool to paying users \"insulting\" to victims of misogyny and sexual violence, saying it, \"simply turns an AI feature that allows the creation of unlawful images into a premium service.\"",
      "Under the U.K. Online Safety Act, sharing intimate images without consent on social media is a criminal offense, and social media companies are required to proactively remove such content, as well as prevent it from appearing in the first place.",
      "If they fail to do so, the companies can face hefty fines or, in last resort cases, face what would effectively be a ban by Britain's independent media regulator Ofcom. Ofcom can compel payment providers, advertisers and internet service providers to stop working with a site, preventing it from generating money or being accessed from the U.K.",
      "In a post shared Monday on its own X account, Ofcom said it was \"aware of serious concerns raised about a feature on Grok on X that produces undressed images of people and sexualised images of children.\"",
      "\"We have made urgent contact with X and xAI to understand what steps they have taken to comply with their legal duties to protect users in the UK. Based on their response we will undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation,\" Ofcom said.",
      "Musk's platform has faced scrutiny from governments around the world, including the European Union and the U.S. Congress, over Grok AI's digital alteration of real images.",
      "On Wednesday, Republican Senator Ted Cruz said in a post on X that \"many of the recent AI-generated posts are unacceptable and a clear violation of my legislation \u2014 now law \u2014 the\u00a0Take It Down Act, as well as X's terms and conditions.\"",
      "\"These unlawful images pose a serious threat to victims' privacy and dignity. They should be taken down and guardrails should be put in place,\" Cruz said, adding that he was encouraged by steps taken by X to remove unlawful images.",
      "On Thursday, Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, threatened to sanction the U.K. government if Starmer moved to ban X in the U.K.",

    "story": [
      "Why does the United States want control of Greenland? President Trump has made it clear that he thinks the U.S. needs to control the Arctic island to ensure the security of America and its NATO allies, a point those allies \u2014 and Greenland \u2014 vehemently disagree with.",
      "But there's more at play here, including a valuable shipping route and access to mineral resources.",
      "Here's what interests the U.S. about the semi-autonomous Danish territory:",
      "\"It's so strategic right now\"",
      "Greenland spans about 836,000 square miles, much of it covered by the Greenland Ice Sheet. It's home to only around 60,000 people and is a semi-autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark with its own elected government.",
      "Its location between the U.S., Russia and Europe makes it strategic for both economic and defense purposes \u2014 especially as melting sea ice has opened up new shipping routes through the Arctic. It is also the location of the northernmost U.S. military base.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed the U.S. needs Greenland for national security purposes.",
      "\"It's so strategic right now,\" he told reporters on Sunday, Jan. 4. \"Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place ... We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it.\"",
      "\"The Americans have a strong interest in overseeing the activities of foreign countries in Greenland because it's such a big security asset for foreign states, and due to that, any investment or activity, from the American point of view, may be seen as a security threat,\" Frank Sejersen, associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, told CBS News earlier this year.",
      "Control over a new, valuable route for shipping",
      "Melting sea ice around Greenland has created more opportunity to use the Northern Sea route \u2014 allowing shippers to save millions of dollars in fuel by taking a shorter route between Europe and Asia that was long only passable in warmer months.",
      "A Russian commercial vessel, aided by an icebreaker, first traversed the route in the winter in February 2021.",
      "Greenland's underground resources",
      "Greenland has reserves of oil, natural gas and highly sought after mineral resources.",

    "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 10:06:59 -0500",
    "summary": "Pope Leo XIV, the Catholic Church's first ever American leader, appears to signal a more inclusive leadership style than his predecessor.",
    "story": [
      "Rome \u2014\u00a0Pope Leo XIV has summoned Catholic cardinals from around the world to the Vatican for a meeting called an \"extraordinary consistory,\" to seek their guidance on the Catholic Church's priorities for the years ahead.",
      "\"I am here to listen,\" Leo, a Chicago native and the first ever pope from the U.S., said Wednesday in his opening remarks. \"This day-and-a-half together will point the way for our path ahead.\"",
      "Of the 245 members of the College of Cardinals, 170 of the so-called \"princes of the church\" were in Vatican City to participate in the gathering.",
      "As it got underway, Leo asked the cardinals to select two of four possible topics for detailed discussions: The missionary nature of the church, further reforms of the Vatican bureaucracy, synodality and liturgy.",
      "A majority chose to prioritize the missionary and synodal themes over the liturgy or Vatican reforms, according to Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni. That means the consistory is likely to focus on how to make the church more missionary, and more responsive to the needs of the faithful.",
      "Significantly, the cardinals chose not to discuss liturgy, which would likely have seen them grapple with divisions within the church over the celebration of the traditional Latin Mass, which became a flashpoint after Pope Francis significantly restricted its use.",
      "The Latin Mass \u2014   also known as the Tridentine mass \u2014 is controversial because it represents a form of Catholic worship that some say is out of touch with modern sensibilities. It is celebrated entirely in Latin, with the priest facing the altar and the faithful receiving communion on the tongue while kneeling. Critics argue that it can feel inaccessible and limits parishioners' participation, while supporters say it is a sacred preservation of tradition.",
      "Merely by convening the consistory, Pope Leo's has underscored his commitment to involving the full College of Cardinals in governance of the Catholic Church, which has some 1.4 billion followers worldwide according to the Vatican.",
      "By contrast, during his 12-year papacy, Pope Francis held only one extraordinary consistory, instead relying primarily on a small group of hand-picked advisors to help him plot the church's course \u2014 a practice that left some cardinals feeling sidelined.",
      "Since his election at the papal conclave in May, the American pontiff's tenure has largely been shaped by commitments inherited from Francis, including the major events of the 2025 Holy Year.",
      "By convening the consistory immediately after those Holy Year events, Leo appears to be signaling the unofficial launch of his own pontificate, and charting a course aligned with his priorities.",
      "Leo signalled on Wednesday that his papacy would be progressive, calling the Second Vatican Council \u2014 a landmark gathering in the 1960s known as Vatican II that was seen as a significant move to modernize the Catholic Church \u2014   the \"guiding star\" of the Church's journey under his leadership.",
      "Among other things, Vatican II allowed for mass to be celebrated in local languages, not just the traditional Latin. It also introduced simpler rites and encouraged more participation by active lay people in congregations, and cemented improved relations between Catholics, Jews and people of other faiths, and promoting the church's engagement with the modern world.",

Many were quick to find photos of Tisdale online, linking her to a group of celebrity moms who included Hilary Duff, Mandy Moore and Meghan Trainor.",

      "HIGHER STROKE RISK LINKED TO CONSUMING CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ALCOHOL, STUDY FINDS",

      "The release of an updated food pyramid this week has sparked mixed reactions from doctors and dietitians. (realfood.gov)",

      "\"If increasing saturated fat leads to a meaningful rise in LDL cholesterol or ApoB (Apolipoprotein B, a protein found on the surface of certain cholesterol-carrying particles in the blood), that intake level is excessive for that individual, regardless of improvements in weight or glucose metrics,\" she said.",

      "Article I, Section 9 declares, \"No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.\"",
      "The most important power granted to Congress is over the federal purse strings. In other words, what Congress deems the federal government should spend.",
      "There were calls from the left to hold up funding for the Pentagon or State Department after the U.S. strike in Venezuela. Now, there\u2019s a debate about hamstringing the Department of Homeland Security and ICE after an agent shot and killed Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis.",
      "Liberal Democrats are apoplectic.",
      "REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: PROGRESSIVES EYE SHUTDOWN LEVERAGE TO REIN IN ICE, VENEZUELA OPERATIONS",
      "\"A child has her lost her mom. And y'all want to pretend that it is OK,\" said Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, fighting back tears. \"I am asking if there is anyone that will stand for the very people that elected us and sent us to Congress?\"",
      "\"A lot of people are talking about different reforms, and that's their prerogative,\" said Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., the top Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee. \"Democrats on the House Homeland Security Committee have written [Chairman Andrew] Garbarino, R-N.Y., saying, \u2018We'd like to have an oversight hearing on what's happening with ICE.\u2019 That's a reasonable request.\"",
      "I pressed Thompson on whether Congress should use appropriations to effect change at ICE.",
      "\"That's above my pay grade,\" answered Thompson.",
      "Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., is the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee. He\u2019s more aggressive about Congress exerting its muscle over the federal treasury.",
      "Residents confront federal agents and Border Patrol agents over their presence in their neighborhood on Atlantic Boulevard in the Los Angeles suburb of Bell. California last year passed a law banning authorities from wearing masks.\u00a0 (Getty Images)",
      "\"We should use every means at our disposal to do it,\" said Raskin. \"Including the appropriations process.\"",
      "Sometimes that involves cutting off money. Sometimes that entails limiting spending. Sometimes lawmakers include language to forbid certain activities by federal departments or agencies. Or the legislative language might direct agencies to handle duties a particular way.",
      "But some progressives are so enraged that they want to slash money for ICE. And maybe even shut down the government.",
      "The next deadline is 11:59 p.m. EST Jan. 30, 2026.",
      "\"I am concerned about that,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told colleague Kelly Phares. \"I think that's a terrible idea.\"",
      "When asked about a possible shutdown over ICE, the speaker believed lawmakers could avoid that.",

      "VANCE DEMANDS DEMOCRATS ANSWER WHETHER ICE OFFICER IN MINNEAPOLIS SHOOTING WAS 'WRONG IN DEFENDING HIS LIFE'",
      "\"It will be weapons-grade stupid,\" said Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo. \"But I don't put anything past them. So, maybe they've not learned anything from the fall shutdown, which was dumb.\"",
      "Congress has not yet addressed the funding bills for the Pentagon or State Department for fiscal year 2026. The same with DHS, although that bill is coming soon.",
      "Funding for nine distinct sections of the federal government expires at the end of the day on Jan. 30. That includes DHS.",
      "The House just approved a \"minibus\" spending package, tackling appropriations for energy and water programs, the Department of Interior and the Departments of Commerce and Justice and science programs. The plan is for the Senate to align with the House on these bills. But, regardless, Congress would probably have to approve another \"continuing resolution\" (CR) to keep the lights on in all other quarters of the federal government after the Jan. 30 deadline.",
      "A CR simply renews all federal funding at present levels. So, it\u2019s likely Congress would OK whatever spending bills they\u2019ve worked out and put everything else in a CR to avoid a shutdown.",
      "But some progressives have other ideas. They want to use this government funding deadline as \"leverage\" over ICE and operations related to Venezuela.",
      "Passing a new DHS appropriations bill gives lawmakers opportunities to alter policy or contour the funding there. If both the House and Senate haven\u2019t approved a full-year DHS spending package, Congress would simply re-up the current levels for the time being.",
      "That is, unless Republicans lack the votes on their side, and they need Democrats to bail them out. Some progressive Democrats are pushing for a shutdown over the ICE issue alone. But it\u2019s probably not going to come to that.",
      "The U.S. Capitol dome Jan. 2, 2025\u00a0 (Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)",
      "Why?",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., don\u2019t want to go anywhere near another fight over government funding this year.",
      "\"Is ICE a red line in the funding fight? Must that be part of any funding bill?\" CNN\u2019s Manu Raju asked Jeffries.",
      "\"Our focus right now, in terms of the appropriations bill, are getting the three bills that are going to be on the floor today over the finish line. And then we'll turn to the Homeland Security,\" Jeffries said just hours before the House approved the triumvirate of other spending packages.",
      "But I followed up, asking Jeffries about why Democrats wouldn\u2019t assert themselves if this issue was so critical.",
      "\"No, what I'm focused on right now, Chad, is to make life better for the American people by extending the Affordable Care Act tax credits. Which, by the way, a lot of folks in this institution believe was not possible,\" said Jeffries.That\u2019s a reference to the Democrats\u2019 bill to renew the expired Obamacare subsidies that passed Thursday. Remember that extending those subsidies was at the heart of last year\u2019s government shutdown.",
      "Schumer punted as well when asked about ICE and congressional spending.",

      "Silence from the Senate\u2019s top Democrat.",
      "Fox is told that there\u2019s no appetite from Democratic leaders for another shutdown. They fear that could upend their midterm strategy. So, they are trying to quash talk about defunding ICE in hopes they can maintain a fragile truce over government funding between now and Jan. 30.",
      "There is no love lost between Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and ICE. Despite pushes from fellow progressives to lean into ICE funding, even she understands the pragmatism of Jeffries and Schumer on this issue.",
      "\"They're responsible for leading an entire caucus that elects members from across the country. So, they're in a different position,\" said Ocasio-Cortez.",
      "However, Ocasio-Cortez added that funding for ICE \"exploded virtually overnight, and we are seeing the ramifications of it in terms of the abuse of power that is happening.\"",
      "She also mentioned that Democrats could pursue cuts for ICE in another funding round or if they win the House majority in the midterms.",

      "So, now we have a seismic event in Minnesota the is dominating the political landscape, perhaps on the level of George Floyd\u2019s death in 2020. Democrats demand that their party use political tools available to them to \"fight.\" One avenue is appropriations and funding for DHS and ICE.",
      "We\u2019ll know soon if Jeffries and Schumer picked the \"right\" fight or if the Democratic base will demand a \"new\" fight.",

      "Healthcare breaches often lead to credential-stuffing attacks elsewhere. A password manager ensures every account uses a unique password, so one exposed dataset can't unlock everything else. It also makes it easier to update passwords quickly after a breach.",

These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Healthcare organizations remain prime targets for cybercriminal groups because of the volume and sensitivity of the data they store. Medical records contain a mix of personal, financial and health information that is difficult to change once exposed. Unlike a password, you cannot reset a diagnosis or treatment history. This breach also shows how early disclosures often underestimate impact. Large healthcare networks rely on complex systems and third-party vendors, which can slow forensic analysis in the early stages. As investigations continue, the number of affected individuals often climbs.",

      "Grok's apology appeared only after a user prompted the chatbot to write a heartfelt explanation for people lacking context. In other words, the system did not proactively address the issue. It responded because someone asked it to.",
      "Around the same time, researchers and journalists uncovered widespread misuse of Grok's image tools. According to monitoring firm Copyleaks, users were generating nonconsensual, sexually manipulated images of real women, including minors and well-known figures.",
      "After reviewing Grok's publicly accessible photo feed, Copyleaks identified a conservative rate of roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute, based on images involving real people with no clear indication of consent. The firm says the misuse escalated quickly, shifting from consensual self-promotion to large-scale harassment enabled by AI.",
      "Copyleaks CEO and co-founder Alon Yamin said, \"When AI systems allow the manipulation of real people's images without clear consent, the impact can be immediate and deeply personal.\"",
      "PROTECTING KIDS FROM AI CHATBOTS: WHAT THE GUARD ACT MEANS",
      "Grok admitted it generated and shared an AI image that violated ethical standards and may have broken U.S. child protection laws. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Sexualized images of minors are illegal",
      "This is not a gray area. Generating or distributing sexualized images of minors is a serious criminal offense in the United States and many other countries. Under U.S. federal law, such content is classified as child sexual abuse material. Penalties can include five to 20 years in prison, fines up to $250,000 and mandatory sex offender registration. Similar laws apply in the U.K. and France.",
      "In 2024, a Pennsylvania man received nearly eight years in prison for creating and possessing deepfake CSAM involving child celebrities. That case set a clear precedent. Grok itself acknowledged this legal reality in its post, stating that AI images depicting minors in sexualized contexts are illegal.",
      "The scale of the problem is growing fast",
      "A July report from the Internet Watch Foundation, a nonprofit that tracks and removes child sexual abuse material online, shows how quickly this threat is accelerating. Reports of AI-generated child sexual abuse imagery jumped by 400% in the first half of 2025 alone. Experts warn that AI tools lower the barrier to potential abuse. What once required technical skill or access to hidden forums can now happen through a simple prompt on a mainstream platform.",
      "Real people are being targeted",
      "The harm is not abstract. Reuters documented cases where users asked Grok to digitally undress real women whose photos were posted on X. In multiple documented cases, Grok fully complied. Even more disturbing, users targeted images of a 14-year-old actress Nell Fisher from the Netflix series \"Stranger Things.\" Grok later admitted there were isolated cases in which users received images depicting minors in minimal clothing. In another Reuters investigation, a Brazilian musician described watching AI-generated bikini images of herself spread across X after users prompted Grok to alter a harmless photo. Her experience mirrors what many women and girls are now facing.",
      "Governments respond worldwide",
      "The backlash has gone global. In France, multiple ministers referred X to an investigative agency over possible violations of the EU's Digital Services Act, which requires platforms to prevent and mitigate the spread of illegal content. Violations can trigger heavy fines. In India, the country's IT ministry gave xAI 72 hours to submit a report detailing how it plans to stop the spread of obscene and sexually explicit material generated by Grok. Grok has also warned publicly that xAI could face potential probes from the Department of Justice or lawsuits tied to these failures.",

      "Concerns grow over Grok's safety and government use",
      "The incident raises serious concerns about online privacy, platform security and the safeguards designed to protect minors.",
      "Elon Musk, the owner of X and founder of xAI, had not offered a public response at the time of publication. That silence comes at a sensitive time. Grok has been authorized for official government use under an 18-month federal contract. This approval was granted despite objections from more than 30 consumer advocacy groups that warned the system lacked proper safety testing.",
      "Over the past year, Grok has been accused by critics of spreading misinformation about major news events, promoting antisemitic rhetoric and sharing misleading health information. It also competed directly with tools like ChatGPT and Gemini while operating with fewer visible safety restrictions. Each controversy raises the same question. Can a powerful AI tool be deployed responsibly without strong oversight and enforcement?",
      "What parents and users should know",
      "If you encounter sexualized images of minors or other abusive material online, report it immediately. In the United States, you can contact the FBI tip line or seek help from the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.",
      "Do not download, share, screenshot or interact with the content in any way. Even viewing or forwarding illegal material can expose you to serious legal risk.",
      "Parents should also talk with children and teens about AI image tools and social media prompts. Many of these images are created through casual requests that do not feel dangerous at first. Teaching kids to report content, close the app and tell a trusted adult can stop harm from spreading further.",
      "Platforms may fail. Safeguards may lag. But early reporting and clear conversations at home remain one of the most effective ways to protect children online.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The Grok scandal highlights a dangerous reality. As AI spreads faster, these systems amplify harm at an unprecedented scale. When safeguards fail, real people suffer, and children face serious risk. At the same time, trust cannot depend on apologies issued after harm occurs. Instead, companies must earn trust through strong safety design, constant monitoring and real accountability when problems emerge.",

      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss grocery stores collecting biometric data, including facial recognition and eye scans, as Wegmans confirms limited use in higher-risk locations.",
      "January feels like a reset. A new calendar. New goals. New habits. While you clean out your inbox, organize paperwork or set resolutions, however, scammers also hit reset, and they start with your personal data.",
      "That is because January is one of the most important months for online privacy. This is when data brokers refresh profiles and scammers rebuild their target lists.",
      "As a result, the longer your information stays online, the more complete and valuable your profile becomes. To help address this, institutions like the U.S. Department of the Treasury have released advisories urging people to stay vigilant and avoid data-related scams.",
      "For that reason, taking action early in the year can significantly reduce scam attempts, lower identity theft risks, and limit unwanted exposure for the rest of the year.",

      "STOP DATA BROKERS FROM SELLING YOUR INFORMATION ONLINE",
      "Why personal data does not expire and keeps compounding online",
      "Many people assume old information eventually becomes useless. Unfortunately, that's not how data brokers work.",

      "Marketing databases and online activity.",
      "Each year adds another layer. A new address. A changed phone number. A family connection. A retirement milestone. On its own, one data point doesn't mean much. But together, they create a detailed identity profile that scammers can use to convincingly impersonate you. That's why waiting makes things worse, not better.",
      "Why scammers 'rebuild' targets at the start of the year",
      "Scammers don't randomly target people. They work from lists. At the beginning of the year, those lists get refreshed.",
      "Data brokers update and resell profiles after year-end records closeNew public filings from the previous year become searchableMarketing databases reset campaigns and audience segmentsScam networks repackage data into \"fresh\" target lists.",

      "As personal information accumulates across databases, digital profiles grow more detailed and more valuable to scammers over time. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why taking action in January protects you all year long",
      "Removing your data early isn't just about stopping scams today; it's about cutting off the supply chain that fuels them. When your information is removed from data broker databases:",
      "It's harder for scammers to find accurate contact detailsPhishing messages become less convincingImpersonation attempts fail more oftenYour identity becomes less valuable to resell.",

      "Phishing messages become less convincing",
      "Impersonation attempts fail more often",
      "Your identity becomes less valuable to resell.",
      "This has a compounding benefit in the opposite direction. The fewer lists you appear on in January, the fewer times your data gets reused, resold, and recycled throughout the year. That's why I consistently recommend addressing data exposure before problems start, not after.",
      "Why retirees and families feel the impact first",
      "January is especially important for retirees and families because they're more likely to become targets of fraud, scams, and other crimes.",

      "Deleting cookiesUnsubscribing from emailsChanging passwordsSigning up for credit monitoring.",
      "Deleting cookies",
      "Unsubscribing from emails",
      "Changing passwords",
      "Signing up for credit monitoring.",
      "Those steps help, but they don't remove your data from broker databases. Credit monitoring services alert you after something goes wrong. Password changes don't affect public profiles. And unsubscribing doesn't stop data resale. If your personal information is still sitting in hundreds of databases, scammers can find you.",
      "The January privacy reset that actually works",
      "If you want fewer scam attempts for the rest of the year, the most effective step is removing your personal data at the source.",
      "You can do this in one of two ways. You can submit removal requests yourself, or you can use a professional data removal service to handle the process for you.",
      "Manually removing your data means identifying dozens or even hundreds of data broker websites, finding their opt-out forms and submitting removal requests one by one. You also need to verify your identity, track responses and repeat the process whenever your information reappears.",
      "This approach works, but it requires time, organization, and ongoing follow-up.",
      "A data removal service handles this process on your behalf. These services typically:",

      "Because these services handle sensitive personal information, it is important to choose one that follows strict security standards and uses verified removal methods.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Scammers don't wait for mistakes. They wait for exposed data. January is when profiles are refreshed, lists are rebuilt, and targets are chosen for the year ahead. The longer your personal information stays online, the more complete-and dangerous-your digital profile becomes. The good news? You can stop the cycle. Removing your data now reduces scam attempts, protects your identity, and gives you a quieter, safer year ahead. If you're going to make one privacy move this year, make it early-and make it count.",

      "Every January, the Consumer Electronics Show, better known as CES, takes over Las Vegas. It's where tech companies show off what they're building next, from products that are almost ready to buy to ideas that feel pulled from the future.",
      "CES 2026 was packed with moments that made people stop and stare. Some of the tech felt practical. Some of it felt a bit wild. However, these 10 showstoppers were the ones everyone kept talking about on the show floor.",

      "1) LG Wallpaper TV",
      "LG pushed TV design to the edge of invisibility once again at CES 2026. The latest Wallpaper TV, officially called the LG OLED evo W6, is just 9mm thin and sits completely flush against the wall. From the side, it looks more like glass than a television.",
      "This version feels far more practical than earlier Wallpaper models. All inputs live in a separate Zero Connect Box, which wirelessly sends visually lossless 4K video and audio to the screen from up to 30 feet away. That keeps cables out of sight and gives you more freedom when placing the TV.",
      "THIS EV HAS A FACE, AND IT TALKS BACK WITH AI",
      "The LG CLOiD robot and the LG OLED evo AI Wallpaper TV are displayed onstage during an LG Electronics news conference at CES 2026, an annual consumer electronics trade show, in Las Vegas, Jan. 5, 2026. (REUTERS/Steve Marcus)",
      "Picture quality also takes a major step forward. LG's new Hyper Radiant Color Technology boosts brightness, improves color accuracy and deepens blacks while cutting screen reflections. With Brightness Booster Ultra, the Wallpaper TV reaches up to 3.9 times the brightness of conventional OLEDs and stays easy to watch even in bright rooms.",
      "Powering it all is LG's new Alpha 11 AI Processor Gen3. Its upgraded Dual AI Engine preserves natural detail while reducing noise, avoiding the overly sharp look that plagues some high-end TVs. Gamers also get plenty to like, including 4K at up to 165Hz, ultra-fast response times and support for NVIDIA G-SYNC and AMD FreeSync Premium.",
      "Availability: Expected later in 2026 through select retailers.",
      "2) Dreame Cyber X Stair-Climbing Robot Vacuum",
      "Dreame showed plenty of power at CES 2026, but the real jaw-dropper was the Cyber X concept. This robot vacuum uses a four-legged base that lets it climb stairs on its own, turning multi-level cleaning into something that finally feels automated.",
      "The design looks unusual at first, almost like a robot pet. Once it starts moving, though, the idea clicks. A built-in water tank reduces trips back to the dock, which should help extend cleaning sessions and preserve battery life.",
      "Dreame\u2019s Cyber X concept uses a four-legged design to climb stairs on its own, hinting at a new era of autonomous home robots. (Dreame)",
      "It's still a concept, but Cyber X feels like a glimpse at where home robots are headed. Less rolling around. More real autonomy.",
      "Availability: Concept product.",
      "3) SwitchBot AI MindClip",
      "SwitchBot joined the growing AI wearable trend with the MindClip, a tiny device designed to act like a second brain. It clips on easily, weighs just 18 grams and stays out of the way while quietly doing its job.",
      "MindClip can record conversations and meetings, summarize calls and create AI-powered notes. It also supports more than 100 languages, making it useful for work, travel or multilingual households. Like similar devices, it lets you listen back to recordings and read transcriptions later.",
      "Where MindClip aims to stand out is in memory. SwitchBot says users will be able to search past recordings and track down important details it captured earlier, turning everyday conversations into a searchable archive. That could be especially helpful for busy professionals and students who juggle calls, classes and meetings.",
      "The tiny MindClip clips on discreetly while recording, transcribing and organizing conversations using AI. (SwitchBot)",
      "Details are still limited, and no pricing has been announced. SwitchBot has hinted that many key features will require a subscription, which puts it in line with competing AI wearables.",
      "Availability: Not yet available. Pricing and preorder details have not been released.",
      "4) LG CLOiD Home Robot",
      "LG didn't just show off a concept robot at CES. It showed a glimpse of what a true AI-powered home might look like.",
      "At LG Electronics' booth at CES 2026, the company unveiled LG CLOiD, a home robot designed to handle real household chores as part of its \"Zero Labor Home\" vision. This isn't just a rolling assistant. CLOiD can fold laundry, help in the kitchen and move safely around furniture.",
      "The robot uses a stable, wheeled base inspired by robot vacuums, paired with a tilting torso and two articulated arms. Each arm has human-like movement and individual fingers, allowing CLOiD to grip, lift and place objects with surprising precision. In demos, it retrieved items from the fridge, loaded an oven and folded clothes after a laundry cycle.",
      "CLOiD's head acts as a mobile AI home hub, using cameras, sensors and voice-based AI to understand routines and control LG's ThinQ-connected appliances. It still feels futuristic and a little unsettling, but the technology behind it is hard to ignore. If LG can make it practical and affordable, CLOiD could mark a real step toward AI doing the housework for us.",
      "Availability: Concept and research-stage technology. Not planned for consumer sale at this time.",
      "5) Glyde Smart Hair Clippers",
      "Glyde is trying to solve one of the most frustrating parts of grooming: cutting your own hair without messing it up.",
      "The company introduced AI-powered smart hair clippers designed to guide the cut for you. You wear a simple headband that marks where a fade should start, choose a style in the app and let the clippers do the rest. Built-in sensors track your speed, angle and movement in real time, automatically adjusting the blade to keep cuts even and fades smooth.",
      "This is very much a trust exercise. You're letting software guide sharp blades near your head, and that won't be for everyone. But for people who skip the barber, hate appointments or just want a quick cleanup at home, the idea makes sense.",
      "Glyde's system is built to be \"mistake-proof.\" Move too fast, and the blade retracts. Tilt it the wrong way, and it trims less. Popular styles like buzz cuts, crew cuts and side parts are baked into the app, with step-by-step guidance that adapts as you cut.",
      "It's a one-time investment meant to replace repeat barber visits. If it works as promised, Glyde could turn haircuts into a 10-minute task you do on your own schedule.",
      "Availability: Limited early access or direct sales may come later in 2026.",
      "6) LEGO Smart Bricks",
      "LEGO is adding a digital twist to its classic bricks, and surprisingly, it works. At CES, LEGO introduced LEGO Smart Play, a new line built around \"Smart Bricks\" that look like regular LEGO pieces but hide sensors, LEDs and speakers inside. The bricks can detect movement, distance and interaction, lighting up, changing color and producing sound effects in real time as kids play.",
      "The launch leans heavily into Star Wars, including sets with Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, an X-Wing and a TIE fighter. In one demo, a Luke minifigure produced its own lightsaber sounds. In another, bricks made swooshing and crashing noises when attached to vehicles, while figures reacted when they were \"hit.\" It felt playful, immersive and instantly understandable.",
      "A LEGO piece with a smart brick attached is displayed during a LEGO news conference ahead of the CES tech show Monday, Jan. 5, 2026, in Las Vegas. (AP Photo/Abbie Parr)",
      "Smart Tags snap into the bricks to control different behaviors, and a quick shake wakes everything up. Pricing starts around $70 and climbs to about $160, with Star Wars sets arriving in March. LEGO hasn't shared details on battery life yet, but the goal is clear: add interactivity without pushing kids toward screens.",
      "This feels like LEGO doing tech the right way. You still build with your hands, imagine the story and snap bricks together. The technology simply brings the play to life.",
      "Availability: Launching March 2026. Expected to be sold through LEGO and major retailers.",
      "7) Autoliv Foldable Steering Wheel",
      "This might look like a small change, but it could completely reshape future car interiors.",
      "Autoliv unveiled the world's first foldable steering wheel designed for Level 4 autonomous vehicles. When the car switches into self-driving mode, the steering wheel retracts smoothly into the dashboard, opening up the cabin and giving occupants more space to relax, work or just stretch out.",
      "What makes this impressive is that safety isn't sacrificed. Autoliv built an adaptive airbag system that changes with the driving mode. When you're driving manually, the airbag lives in the steering wheel as usual. Once the wheel folds away in autonomous mode, a separate airbag in the instrument panel takes over, keeping protection intact at all times.",
      "It's a smart, practical solution to a problem automakers are already facing. If cars don't always need a steering wheel, why should it always be in the way? Autoliv's design shows how autonomy isn't just about software, it's about rethinking the entire cabin experience.",
      "Availability: Automotive supplier technology for future vehicles.",
      "8) TDM Neo Hybrid Headphones",
      "These might be the most interesting headphones at CES for one simple reason: they refuse to stay just headphones.",
      "Tomorrow Doesn't Matter, better known as TDM, unveiled Neo, a premium on-ear 2-in-1 hybrid headphone that physically twists into a compact Bluetooth speaker. No docking. No accessories. Just a quick rotation, and your personal audio turns into shared sound. Amazing, right?",
      "The concept might sound a bit gimmicky, but the execution feels solid. The hinge mechanism is sturdy, the transformation is intuitive, and the idea makes a lot of sense in real life. You can listen privately on a train, then flip Neo into speaker mode the moment you meet up with friends.",
      "TDM describes this as going from \"solo to social,\" and that's exactly the appeal. It blurs the line between headphones and portable speakers in a way we haven't really seen before. For travelers, outdoor users, or anyone who hates carrying multiple audio devices, Neo could be a genuinely very useful hybrid device.",
      "Availability: TDM will be launching Neo on Kickstarter later this month and will begin shipping in July.",
      "9) Jackery Solar Mars Bot",
      "Jackery made waves at CES with the Solar Mars Bot, a mobile solar generator that can move, track sunlight and recharge itself without constant setup.",
      "The Solar Mars Bot uses AI-enhanced computer vision to navigate on its own, follow its user and reposition throughout the day to capture the strongest available sunlight. Instead of manually adjusting panels or relocating gear, the system handles those decisions automatically. When not in use, its solar panels fold and retract, which helps make storage and transport more practical.",
      "What sets this system apart is how it blends mobility with energy storage. Unlike fixed solar installations that stay in one place or portable generators that must be carried and recharged by hand, the Solar Mars Bot actively manages its own power intake. It tracks the sun, recharges itself using solar energy and delivers power where it is needed.",
      "That makes it especially useful for extended power outages, off-grid living, emergency backup and outdoor adventures where access to electricity can change throughout the day. The Solar Mars Bot shows how portable power can become more intelligent, adaptable and hands-off when conditions are unpredictable.",
      "Availability: Prototype showcased at CES.",
      "10) Timeli Personal Safety Device",
      "Timeli grabbed a lot of attention at CES 2026 with a simple, immediate approach to personal safety. By combining a flashlight, HD video recording, a loud alarm, GPS tracking and live emergency dispatch into one handheld device, it earned a CES 2026 Innovation Awards Honoree and plenty of interest on the show floor.",
      "Instead of opening an app or tapping through menus, Timeli relies on muscle memory. A quick press turns on a powerful flashlight and starts recording video. If a situation escalates, pressing and holding the SOS button triggers a full safety sequence. The alarm sounds, live video begins streaming, GPS coordinates lock in and two-way communication connects directly to emergency dispatch over cellular service.",
      "That live connection matters. Timeli works with RapidSOS to give dispatchers real-time video and location data. This added clarity helps responders understand what is happening faster and send the right help sooner. Studies show video verified emergencies can cut response times dramatically, while also reducing false alarms.",
      "Timeli works even without a phone. Built-in cellular, GPS, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth allow it to operate on its own or alongside the companion app for iOS and Android. Users can adjust video quality, light brightness and alarm volume to match their needs. Cloud video storage and alerts add another layer of reassurance.",
      "WORLD'S THINNEST AI GLASSES FEATURE BUILT-IN AI ASSISTANT",
      "The design stays practical. Timeli is about the size and weight of a smartphone, so it fits easily in a pocket, purse or backpack. Battery life supports long standby time, extended daily use and several hours of active protection. It even doubles as a power bank, while reserving enough charge to stay ready for emergencies.",
      "Availability:\u00a0Priced at $249 for preorder through timeli.com. Timeli includes a year of professional monitoring before transitioning to a monthly subscription.",
      "Honorable mentions: CES 2026 products worth checking out",
      "These products also stood out on the CES 2026 show floor, highlighting smart design choices and meaningful innovation that point to the future of consumer tech.",
      "ASUS reimagined portable productivity with the 2026 Zenbook Duo. This laptop snaps two 14-inch 3K ASUS Lumina OLED touchscreens together into a single mobile workstation you can carry with one hand.",
      "The dual-screen setup lets you keep a main project open on one display while chats, calls or reference material live on the other. That alone cuts down on constant app switching. The OLED panels deliver rich color, deep blacks, smooth motion and built-in eye care that makes long sessions easier on your eyes.",
      "ASUS also upgraded what you hear. A new six-speaker system replaces the previous two-speaker design, creating fuller, more immersive audio for movies, music, and calls.

    "summary": "Cybercriminals allegedly sent 9,000+ phishing emails using Google Cloud tools, targeting 3,200 organizations by exploiting legitimate automation features.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Cybercriminals have found a clever new way to get phishing emails straight into inboxes.",
      "Instead of spoofing brands, they are abusing real cloud tools that people already trust. Security researchers say attackers recently hijacked a legitimate email feature inside Google Cloud.",
      "The result was thousands of phishing messages that looked and felt like normal Google notifications. Many slipped past spam filters with ease.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2013 when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "How this Google Cloud phishing attack worked",
      "At the center of the campaign was Google Cloud Application Integration. This service allows businesses to send automated email notifications from workflows they build. Attackers exploited the Send Email task inside that system. Because the messages came from a real Google address, they appeared authentic to both users and security tools.",
      "According to Check Point, a global cybersecurity firm that tracks and analyzes large-scale threat campaigns, the emails were sent from a legitimate Google-owned address and closely matched Google's notification style. Fonts, wording, and layout all looked familiar. Over a two-week period in December 2025, attackers sent more than 9,000 phishing emails targeting roughly 3,200 organizations across the U.S., Europe, Canada, Asia Pacific, and Latin America.",
      "Attackers used trusted Google Cloud infrastructure to route victims through multiple redirects before revealing the scam. (Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)",
      "MALICIOUS CHROME EXTENSIONS CAUGHT STEALING SENSITIVE DATA",
      "Why Google phishing emails were so convincing",
      "The messages looked like routine workplace alerts. Some claimed you had received a voicemail. Others said you were granted access to a shared document, like a Q4 file. That sense of normalcy lowered suspicion. Many people are used to seeing these exact messages every day. Even more concerning, the emails bypassed common protections like SPF and DMARC because they were sent through Google-owned infrastructure. To email systems, nothing looked fake.",
      "What happens after you click",
      "The attack did not stop at the email. Once a victim clicked the link, they were sent to a page hosted on storage.cloud.google.com. That added another layer of trust. From there, the link redirected again to googleusercontent.com. Next came a fake CAPTCHA or image check. This step blocked automated security scanners while letting real users continue. After passing that screen, victims landed on a fake Microsoft login page hosted on a non-Microsoft domain. Any credentials entered there were captured by the attackers.",
      "Who was targeted in the Google Cloud phishing attack",
      "Check Point says the campaign focused heavily on industries that rely on automated alerts and shared documents. That included manufacturing, technology, finance, professional services, and retail. Other sectors like healthcare, education, government, energy, travel and media were also targeted. These environments see constant permission requests and file-sharing notices, which made the lures feel routine.",
      "\"We have blocked several phishing campaigns involving the misuse of an email notification feature within Google Cloud Application Integration,\" a Google spokesperson told Cyberguy. \"Importantly, this activity stemmed from the abuse of a workflow automation tool, not a compromise of Google\u2019s infrastructure. While we have implemented protections to defend users against this specific attack, we encourage continued caution as malicious actors frequently attempt to spoof trusted brands. We are taking additional steps to prevent further misuse.\"",
      "The incident demonstrates how attackers can weaponize legitimate cloud automation tools without resorting to traditional spoofing.",
      "Ways to stay safe from trusted-looking phishing emails",
      "Phishing emails are getting harder to spot, especially when attackers abuse real cloud platforms like Google Cloud. These steps help reduce risk when emails look familiar and legitimate.",
      "Attackers rely on urgency. Messages about voicemails, shared files or permission changes are designed to make you click fast. Pause before taking action. Ask yourself whether you were actually expecting that alert. If not, verify it another way.",
      "Always hover over links to preview the destination domain. In this campaign, links jumped across multiple trusted-looking Google domains before landing on a fake login page. If the final destination does not match the service asking you to sign in, close the page immediately.",
      "Shared document alerts are a favorite lure because they feel routine at work. If an email claims you were granted access to a file you do not recognize, do not click directly from the message. Instead, open your browser and sign in to Google Drive or OneDrive manually to check for new files.",
      "The final step led users to a fake Microsoft login page, where entered credentials were silently stolen. (Stack Social)",
      "Password managers can be a strong last line of defense. They will not autofill credentials on fake Microsoft or Google login pages hosted on non-official domains. If your password manager refuses to fill in a login, that is a red flag worth paying attention to.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "NEW GOOGLE AI MAKES ROBOTS SMARTER WITHOUT THE CLOUD",
      "Modern antivirus tools do more than scan files. Many now detect malicious links, fake CAPTCHA pages, and credential harvesting sites in real time. Strong antivirus software can block phishing pages even after a click, which matters in multi-stage attacks like this one.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Phishing campaigns often succeed because attackers already know your email, employer or role. That information is commonly pulled from data broker sites. A data removal service helps remove your personal information from these databases, making it harder for attackers to craft convincing, targeted emails.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web: Cyberguy.com.",
      "Even if attackers steal your password, two-factor authentication (2FA) can stop them from accessing your account. Use app-based authentication or hardware keys when possible, especially for work email, cloud storage, and Microsoft accounts.",
      "If something feels off, report it. Flag suspicious Google or Microsoft alerts to your IT or security team so they can warn others. Early reporting can stop a phishing campaign before it spreads further inside an organization.",
      "Google phishing emails looked like routine workplace alerts. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This campaign highlights a growing shift in phishing tactics. Attackers no longer need to fake brands when they can abuse trusted cloud services directly. As automation becomes more common, security awareness matters more than ever. Even familiar emails deserve a second look, especially when they push urgency or ask for credentials.",

    "published": "Wed, 07 Jan 2026 13:00:18 -0500",
    "summary": "Researchers create supercapacitors from waste PET plastic bottles that could power electric vehicles and electronics within 5 to 10 years.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Each year, billions of single-use plastic bottles end up in landfills or oceans. That waste problem keeps growing. Now, a new scientific breakthrough suggests those same bottles could help power your daily life.",
      "Researchers have developed a way to transform discarded plastic water bottles into high-performance energy storage devices called supercapacitors. The work focuses on PET plastic, short for polyethylene terephthalate, which is used in most beverage bottles.",
      "The research was published in Energy & Fuels and highlighted by the American Chemical Society. Scientists say the discovery could reduce plastic pollution while helping drive cleaner energy technology.",

      "SCIENTISTS EXTRACT SILVER FROM E-WASTE USING COOKING OIL",
      "Discarded PET water bottles are one of the most common sources of plastic waste worldwide, with hundreds of billions produced each year. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why PET plastic waste is such a growing problem",
      "PET plastic is everywhere. According to the researchers, more than 500 billion single-use PET plastic bottles are produced every year. Most are used once and thrown away. Lead researcher Dr. Yun Hang Hu says that scale creates a major environmental challenge.",
      "Instead of letting that plastic pile up, the team focused on upcycling it into something valuable. Their idea was simple but powerful. Turn waste into materials that support renewable energy systems and reduce production costs at the same time.",
      "NEW TECH RECOVERS 92% OF EV BATTERY METALS",
      "Those upcycled materials come together to form an all-waste-plastic supercapacitor designed for fast charging and long term energy storage. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How plastic bottles can store and release energy",
      "Imagine a device that can charge fast and deliver power instantly. That is exactly what supercapacitors do. They store and release energy much faster than traditional batteries, which makes them useful for electric vehicles, solar power systems and everyday electronics.",
      "Hu's team found a way to build these energy storage components using discarded PET plastic water bottles. By reshaping the plastic at extremely high temperatures, the researchers turned waste into materials that can generate electricity efficiently and repeatedly.",
      "Here is how the process works:",
      "For the electrodes, researchers cut PET bottles into tiny, grain-sized pieces. They mixed the plastic with calcium hydroxide and heated it to nearly 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit in a vacuum. That heat transformed the plastic into a porous, electrically conductive carbon powder.",
      "The powder was then formed into thin electrode layers. For the separator, small pieces of PET were flattened and carefully perforated with hot needles. This pattern allowed electric current to pass efficiently while maintaining safety and durability. Once assembled, the device used two carbon electrodes separated by the PET film and submerged in a potassium hydroxide electrolyte.",
      "CIGARETTE BUTTS MAKE ROADS STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE",
      "Researchers use extreme heat to convert waste PET plastic into porous carbon materials that can store and move electricity efficiently. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why the results surprised scientists",
      "When tested, the all-waste-plastic supercapacitor outperformed similar devices made with traditional glass fiber separators. After repeated charging and discharging, it retained 79 percent of its energy capacity. A comparable glass fiber device retained 78 percent. That difference matters. The PET-based design costs less to produce, remains fully recyclable, and supports circular energy storage technologies where waste materials are reused instead of discarded.",
      "What this means for you",
      "This breakthrough could affect everyday life sooner than you might expect. Cheaper supercapacitors can lower the cost of electric vehicles, solar systems and portable electronics. Faster charging and longer device lifespans could follow. It also shows that sustainability does not require giving something up. Waste plastics could become part of the solution instead of the problem. Although this technology is still in development, the research team believes PET-based supercapacitors could reach commercial markets within 5 to 10 years. In the meantime, choosing reusable bottles and plastic-free alternatives still helps reduce waste today.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Turning trash into energy storage is more than a clever idea. It shows how science can tackle two global challenges at once. Plastic pollution continues to grow. Energy demand does too. This research proves that those problems do not have to be solved separately. By rethinking waste as a resource, scientists are building a cleaner and more efficient future from materials we already throw away.",

    "summary": "Cybercriminals use ErrTraffic tool to automate malware distribution through fake browser error messages, with attacks achieving 60% conversion rates.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "A dangerous cybercrime tool has surfaced in underground forums, making it far easier for attackers to spread malware.",
      "Instead of relying on hidden downloads, this tool pushes fake error messages that pressure you into fixing problems that never existed. Security researchers say this method is spreading quickly because it feels legitimate. The page looks broken. The warning feels urgent. The fix sounds simple.",
      "That combination is proving alarmingly effective for cybercriminals.",

      "How fake error malware attacks actually work",
      "These attacks begin with a compromised website. When a visitor lands on the page, something looks wrong right away. Text appears broken. Fonts look scrambled. Visual elements seem corrupted. A pop-up then appears claiming the issue can be fixed with a browser update or a missing system font. A button offers to repair the problem instantly.",
      "Clicking that button copies a command to the clipboard and displays instructions to paste it into PowerShell or a system terminal. That single step launches the infection.",

      "Fake error popups make a website look broken by scrambling text or fonts to create urgency and panic. (Jens B\u00fcttner/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Why this new tool changes the threat landscape",
      "The tool behind these attacks is called ErrTraffic. It automates the entire process and removes the technical barriers that once limited cybercrime operations. For about $800, attackers get a full package with a control panel and scripted payload delivery. Analysts at the Hudson Rock Threat Intelligence Team identified the tool after tracking its promotion on Russian-language forums in early December 2025.",
      "ErrTraffic works through a simple JavaScript injection. A single line of code connects a hacked site to the attacker's dashboard. From there, everything adapts automatically. The script detects the operating system and browser. It then displays a customized fake error message in the correct language. The attack works across Windows, Android, macOS and Linux.",
      "MOST PARKED DOMAINS NOW PUSH SCAMS AND MALWARE",
      "The popups often claim a browser update or missing system font is needed to fix the problem. (Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Why security software struggles to stop it",
      "Traditional malware defenses look for suspicious downloads or unauthorized installations. ErrTraffic avoids both. Browsers see normal text copying. Security tools see a legitimate system utility being opened manually. Nothing appears out of place. That design allows the attack to slip through protections that would normally stop malware in its tracks.",
      "The success rate is deeply concerning",
      "Data pulled from active ErrTraffic campaigns shows conversion rates approaching 60%. That means more than half of the visitors who see the fake error message follow the instructions and install malware. Once active, the tool can deliver infostealers like Lumma or Vidar on Windows devices. Android targets often receive banking trojans instead. The control panel even includes geographic filtering, with built-in blocks for Russia and neighboring regions to avoid drawing attention from local authorities.",
      "What happens after infection?",
      "Once malware is installed, credentials and session data are stolen. Those compromised logins are then used to breach additional websites. Each newly hacked site becomes another delivery vehicle for the same attack. That cycle allows the campaign to grow without direct involvement from the original operator.",
      "FAKE WINDOWS UPDATE PUSHES MALWARE IN NEW CLICKFIX ATTACK",
      "Following the on-screen instructions can quietly trigger malware that steals passwords and personal data. (Kurt Knutsson)",
      "Ways to stay safe from fake error malware",
      "A few smart habits can significantly reduce risk when facing fake error pop-ups and browser-based traps.",
      "Legitimate websites never ask you to copy and paste commands into PowerShell or a system terminal. Fake error malware relies on convincing messages that pressure you into doing exactly that. If a page instructs you to run code to fix a problem, close it immediately.",
      "Fake error campaigns often use broken text, scrambled fonts or warnings about missing files to grab attention. As a result, these visuals create urgency and trigger fear. In reality, a real system problem never announces itself through a random website, so close the page right away.",
      "Real browser and operating system updates come from built-in update tools, not pop-ups on websites. If an update is needed, your device will notify you directly through system settings or trusted app stores.",
      "Strong antivirus software can help block malicious scripts, detect infostealers and stop suspicious behavior before damage spreads. This is especially important since fake error malware targets Windows, Android, macOS and Linux systems.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Stolen credentials fuel the spread of fake error malware. Removing personal information from data broker sites can reduce the impact if login details are compromised and limit how far an attack can spread.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web: Cyberguy.com.",
      "Claims about missing fonts or outdated browsers are a hallmark of these attacks. Modern systems manage fonts automatically, and browsers update themselves. A webpage has no reason to request manual fixes.",
      "If a real update is needed, the operating system will request it directly. A random webpage never should.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Fake error malware works because it plays on a very human reaction. When something on a screen suddenly looks broken, most people want to fix it fast and move on. That split-second decision is exactly what attackers are counting on. Tools like ErrTraffic show how polished these scams have become. The messages look professional. The instructions feel routine. Nothing about the moment screams danger. But behind the scenes, one click can quietly hand over passwords, banking access and personal data. The good news is that slowing down makes a real difference. Closing a suspicious page and trusting built-in system updates can stop these attacks cold. When it comes to pop-ups claiming your device is broken, walking away is often the smartest fix.",

      "Browser extensions promise convenience. Many offer simple tools like new tab pages, translators or video helpers.",
      "Researchers, however, uncovered a long-running malware operation that abused that trust on a massive scale. Koi Security analysts identified the threat while analyzing suspicious infrastructure tied to a campaign known as ShadyPanda. What started as one investigation quickly revealed something far larger.",
      "The group behind it is now known as DarkSpectre. According to Koi researchers, it infected more than 8.8 million users across Chrome, Edge and Firefox over seven years. This was not a smash-and-grab attack. It was slow, deliberate and highly organized. Instead of rushing malicious code into marketplaces, the group played the long game.",

      "MALICIOUS CHROME EXTENSIONS CAUGHT STEALING SENSITIVE DATA",
      "Security researchers say millions of users unknowingly installed browser extensions that later turned malicious after years of appearing legitimate. (Donato Fasano/Getty Images)",
      "One threat actor behind three major campaigns",
      "At first, the activity looked like separate threats. That changed once Koi analysts followed the infrastructure breadcrumbs. By pivoting from domains linked to ShadyPanda, Koi researchers uncovered shared systems powering multiple extension clusters. That analysis confirmed that ShadyPanda, GhostPoster and Zoom Stealer were not separate actors. They were one coordinated operation. Together, these campaigns targeted both everyday users and corporate environments.",
      "This campaign focused on mass surveillance and affiliate fraud. Researchers estimate it affected\u00a0more than 4 million users, with some analyses suggesting the total could reach up to 5.6 million as additional related extensions were linked. In several cases, extensions remained legitimate for more than five years before quietly turning malicious.",
      "This campaign used a clever trick. It hid malicious code inside image files to bypass security checks. It impacted 1.05 million users.",
      "This operation targeted corporate meeting data across more than 28 conferencing platforms. It affected 2.2 million users.",
      "Different goals. Same operator.",
      "How Koi uncovered DarkSpectre's hidden network",
      "The breakthrough came when Koi analysts examined two domains tied to ShadyPanda. Those domains powered legitimate extension features like weather widgets and new tab pages. They were not command servers. That was the trick. Those same clean domains appeared again and again across other extensions that quietly connected to entirely different malicious infrastructure.",
      "One domain led to extensions. Those extensions exposed new domains. Those domains were connected to even more extensions. Following that chain allowed Koi to uncover over 100 connected extensions across multiple browser marketplaces. Some extensions even reused infrastructure already flagged in earlier investigations. That overlap confirmed DarkSpectre was operating at a nation-state scale.",
      "How DarkSpectre stayed hidden for years",
      "DarkSpectre succeeded by blending legitimate functionality with hidden malware. Users got what they expected. Meanwhile, the threat ran quietly in the background.",
      "Some extensions waited days before activating malicious behavior. Others triggered malware on only a small percentage of page loads. This made detection during marketplace reviews extremely difficult.",
      "The group hid JavaScript inside PNG image files. The extension loaded its own logo, extracted the hidden code and executed it silently.",
      "Instead of pushing new extension versions, DarkSpectre controlled everything from its servers. Operators could change behavior anytime without alerting users or marketplaces. Koi researchers noted this approach gave the attackers long-term flexibility and control.",
      "Why the Zoom Stealer campaign stands out",
      "Most malware focuses on consumer fraud. Zoom Stealer focused on intelligence.",
      "According to Koi analysts, these extensions collected the following:",
      "Meeting links with embedded passwordsMeeting IDs, topics and schedulesSpeaker names, titles, bios and photosCompany affiliations and branding",
      "Meeting links with embedded passwords",
      "Meeting IDs, topics and schedules",
      "Speaker names, titles, bios and photos",
      "Company affiliations and branding",
      "Worse yet, the data streamed in real time. The moment a user joined or viewed a meeting, the information flowed out. This type of data enables phishing impersonation and corporate espionage at scale.",
      "Why browser extensions remain a weak link",
      "Extension marketplaces typically evaluate code only at submission or update. Koi's investigation shows how attackers exploit that model. Once an extension earns trust badges and positive reviews, users stop questioning it. That trust becomes a weapon. A clean extension today can become a threat tomorrow.",
      "Ways to stay safe from malicious browser extensions",
      "You do not need to avoid extensions entirely. You do need to stay cautious.",
      "Make sure you turn on automatic updates for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) so you\u2019re always running the latest version without thinking about it.",
      "Remove anything you no longer use. Fewer extensions reduce risk. CyberGuy has step-by-step guides showing how to review and remove browser extensions safely, making it easy to clean up your browser in just a few minutes. In Chrome, Edge and Firefox, open the\u00a0menu, go to\u00a0Extensions or Add-ons, and\u00a0remove anything you do not use or trust.",
      "Official browser stores like the Chrome Web Store have rules and scans to catch bad actors. They\u2019re not perfect, but they are still a better option when compared to a random website on the internet. Extensions from unknown websites or third-party downloads are far more likely to hide malware or spyware.",

      "Some extensions overreach on purpose. A calculator tool asking for your browsing history or a weather app wanting your login data is a huge red flag. Before installing, ask: \"Does this permission match the extension\u2019s job?\" If the answer\u2019s no, don\u2019t install it. Watch out for broad permissions like \"Read and change all your data on websites you visit\" unless it\u2019s clearly justified (e.g., a password manager). If an update suddenly adds new permission requests, dig into why. It might mean the extension\u2019s been sold or hacked.",
      "If you\u2019ve ever saved passwords in your browser (e.g., via the browser's built-in password manager or the \"Save Password\" prompt), those credentials could be at risk if a malicious extension was installed. These built-in managers store passwords locally or in your Google, Microsoft or Firefox account, and a compromised browser can give bad actors a way in.",
      "This doesn\u2019t typically apply to dedicated password manager extensions, which encrypt your data independently and don\u2019t rely on browser storage. However, if you're unsure whether an extension has been compromised, it's always smart to update your master password and enable two-factor authentication.",
      "For maximum safety, change your most important passwords (email, bank, shopping, cloud services) from a different, secure device, such as your phone or another computer where the questionable extension was never installed. Avoid using the same browser that may have been exposed. Then, consider switching to a password manager to create and store strong, unique logins going forward.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks.

Sudden redirects, new tabs opening on their own, unfamiliar search results, popups, slower browsing or websites asking you to re-log in unexpectedly can all signal a malicious or compromised extension. Pay attention if ads appear where they never did before or if your browser settings change without your input.",
      "Koi's investigation shows how attackers rely on patience. Once an extension earns trust and sits quietly for years, users stop watching it. That makes small behavior changes easy to miss. If something feels off, do not ignore it. Disable extensions one by one to identify the culprit. If the issue disappears, remove that extension permanently.",

Koi analysts connected the dots by tracking shared infrastructure across campaigns, but they also warn that some sleeper extensions may still be installed and trusted today.

      "Chrome extensions are supposed to make your browser more useful, but they've quietly become one of the easiest ways for attackers to spy on what you do online. Security researchers recently uncovered two Chrome extensions that have been doing exactly that for years.",
      "These extensions looked like harmless proxy tools, but behind the scenes, they were hijacking traffic and stealing sensitive data from users who trusted them. What makes this case worse is where these extensions were found. Both were listed on Chrome's official extension marketplace.",

      "Security researchers uncovered malicious Chrome extensions that quietly routed users\u2019 web traffic through attacker-controlled servers to steal sensitive data. (Gokhan Balci/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)",
      "Malicious Chrome extensions hiding in plain sight",
      "Researchers at Socket discovered two Chrome extensions using the same name, \"Phantom Shuttle,\" that were posing as tools for proxy routing and network speed testing (via Bleeping Computer). According to the researchers, the extensions have been active since at least 2017.",
      "Both extensions were published under the same developer name and marketed toward foreign trade workers who need to test internet connectivity from different regions. They were sold as subscription-based tools, with prices ranging from roughly $1.40 to $13.60.",
      "At a glance, everything looked normal. The descriptions matched the functionality. The pricing seemed reasonable. The problem was what the extensions were doing after installation.",
      "How Phantom Shuttle steals your data",
      "Socket researchers say Phantom Shuttle routes all your web traffic through proxy servers controlled by the attacker. Those proxies use hardcoded credentials embedded directly into the extension's code. To avoid detection, the malicious logic is hidden inside what appears to be a legitimate jQuery library.",
      "The attackers didn't just leave credentials sitting in plain text. The extensions hide them using a custom character-index encoding scheme. Once active, the extension listens to web traffic and intercepts HTTP authentication challenges on any site you visit.",
      "To make sure traffic always flows through their infrastructure, the extensions dynamically reconfigure Chrome's proxy settings using an auto-configuration script. This forces your browser to route requests exactly where the attacker wants them.",
      "In its default \"smarty\" mode, Phantom Shuttle routes traffic from more than 170 high-value domains through its proxy network. That list includes developer platforms, cloud service dashboards, social media sites and adult content portals. Local networks and the attacker's own command-and-control domain are excluded, likely to avoid breaking things or raising suspicion.",
      "While acting as a man-in-the-middle, the extension can capture anything you submit through web forms. That includes usernames, passwords, card details, personal information, session cookies from HTTP headers and API tokens pulled directly from network requests.",

    "story": [
      "Attorney Jay Edelson discusses the lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, alleging that ChatGPT exacerbated the mental illness and paranoid delusions of a man who killed his mother and then himself.",
      "Artificial intelligence chatbots are quickly becoming part of our daily lives. Many of us turn to them for ideas, advice or conversation. For most, that interaction feels harmless. However, mental health experts now warn that for a small group of vulnerable people, long and emotionally charged conversations with AI may worsen delusions or psychotic symptoms.",
      "Doctors stress this does not mean chatbots cause psychosis. Instead, growing evidence suggests that AI tools can reinforce distorted beliefs among individuals already at risk. That possibility has prompted new research and clinical warnings from psychiatrists. Some of those concerns have already surfaced in lawsuits alleging that chatbot interactions may have contributed to serious harm during emotionally sensitive situations.",

      "What psychiatrists are seeing in patients using AI chatbots",
      "Psychiatrists describe a repeating pattern. A person shares a belief that does not align with reality. The chatbot accepts that belief and responds as if it were true. Over time, repeated validation can strengthen the belief rather than challenge it.",
      "OPINION: THE FAITH DEFICIT IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SHOULD ALARM EVERY AMERICAN",
      "Mental health experts warn that emotionally intense conversations with AI chatbots may reinforce delusions in vulnerable users, even though the technology does not cause psychosis. (Philip Dulian/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Clinicians say this feedback loop can deepen delusions in susceptible individuals. In several documented cases, the chatbot became integrated into the person's distorted thinking rather than remaining a neutral tool. Doctors warn that this dynamic raises concern when AI conversations are frequent, emotionally engaging and left unchecked.",
      "Why AI chatbot conversations feel different from past technology",
      "Mental health experts note that chatbots differ from earlier technologies linked to delusional thinking. AI tools respond in real time, remember prior conversations and adopt supportive language. That experience can feel personal and validating.",
      "For individuals already struggling with reality testing, those qualities may increase fixation rather than encourage grounding. Clinicians caution that risk may rise during periods of sleep deprivation, emotional stress or existing mental health vulnerability.",
      "How AI chatbots can reinforce false or delusional beliefs",
      "Doctors say many reported cases center on delusions rather than hallucinations. These beliefs may involve perceived special insight, hidden truths or personal significance. Chatbots are designed to be cooperative and conversational. They often build on what someone types rather than challenge it. While that design improves engagement, clinicians warn it can be problematic when a belief is false and rigid.",
      "Mental health professionals say the timing of symptom escalation matters. When delusions intensify during prolonged chatbot use, AI interaction may represent a contributing risk factor rather than a coincidence.",
      "OPENAI TIGHTENS AI RULES FOR TEENS BUT CONCERNS REMAIN",
      "Psychiatrists say some patients report chatbot responses that validate false beliefs, creating a feedback loop that can worsen symptoms over time. (Nicolas Maeterlinck/Belga Mag/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "What research and case reports reveal about AI chatbots",
      "Peer-reviewed research and clinical case reports have documented people whose mental health declined during periods of intense chatbot engagement. In some instances, individuals with no prior history of psychosis required hospitalization after developing fixed false beliefs connected to AI conversations. International studies reviewing health records have also identified patients whose chatbot activity coincided with negative mental health outcomes. Researchers emphasize that these findings are early and require further investigation.",
      "A peer-reviewed Special Report published in Psychiatric News titled\u00a0\"AI-Induced Psychosis: A New Frontier in Mental Health\" examined emerging concerns around AI-induced psychosis and cautioned that existing evidence is largely based on isolated cases rather than population-level data. The report states:\u00a0\"To date, these are individual cases or media coverage reports; currently, there are no epidemiological studies or systematic population-level analyses of the potentially deleterious mental health effects of conversational AI.\"\u00a0The authors emphasize that while reported cases are serious and warrant further investigation, the current evidence base remains preliminary and heavily dependent on anecdotal and nonsystematic reporting.",
      "What AI companies say about mental health risks",
      "OpenAI says it continues working with mental health experts to improve how its systems respond to signs of emotional distress. The company says newer models aim to reduce excessive agreement and encourage real-world support when appropriate. OpenAI has also announced plans to hire a new Head of Preparedness, a role focused on identifying potential harms tied to its AI models and strengthening safeguards around issues ranging from mental health to cybersecurity as those systems grow more capable.",
      "Other chatbot developers have adjusted policies as well, particularly around access for younger audiences, after acknowledging mental health concerns. Companies emphasize that most interactions do not result in harm and that safeguards continue to evolve.",
      "What this means for everyday AI chatbot use",
      "Mental health experts urge caution, not alarm. The vast majority of people who interact with chatbots experience no psychological issues. Still, doctors advise against treating AI as a therapist or emotional authority. Those with a history of psychosis, severe anxiety or prolonged sleep disruption may benefit from limiting emotionally intense AI conversations. Family members and caregivers should also pay attention to behavioral changes tied to heavy chatbot engagement.",

      "Tips for using AI chatbots more safely",
      "Mental health experts stress that most people can interact with AI chatbots without problems. Still, a few practical habits may help reduce risk during emotionally intense conversations.",
      "Avoid treating AI chatbots as a replacement for professional mental health care or trusted human support.Take breaks if conversations begin to feel emotionally overwhelming or all-consuming.Be cautious if an AI response strongly reinforces beliefs that feel unrealistic or extreme.Limit late-night or sleep-deprived interactions, which can worsen emotional instability.Encourage open conversations with family members or caregivers if chatbot use becomes frequent or isolating.",

      "The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer involved in the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good was dragged by an illegal immigrant sex offender's vehicle in June, reports indicate.",
      "The June incident resulted in the arrest of Roberto Carlos Munoz-Guatemala, who the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) described as \"a serial criminal illegal alien.\"",
      "Munoz-Guatemala allegedly dragged the ICE officer 50 yards with his car in Bloomington, Minnesota, while trying to evade arrest. During a traffic stop, Munoz-Guatemala refused to exit his vehicle and tried to flee law enforcement, according to DHS. The department said the ICE officer still had his arm inside Munoz-Guatemala's vehicle as the illegal immigrant tried to drive away. The officer was hospitalized due to his injuries.",
      "At the time, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that Munoz-Guatemala is an illegal alien who \"has been committing violent crimes in the U.S. for nearly 15 years.\" She said Munoz-Guatemala \"is a convicted child sex offender who has a rap sheet that includes an arrest for domestic assault and multiple driving offenses.\"",

      "\"Under Governor Tim Walz, this sicko was living in Minnesota without consequence,\" McLaughlin said in June. \"Instead of comparing ICE law enforcement to the Gestapo, Governor Walz should be thanking our brave law enforcement for arresting these violent criminals.\"",
      "DHS said it was unknown when Munoz-Guatemala entered the country from Mexico, but the department added that his rap sheet in the U.S. dated back to 2010. The department said Munoz-Guatemala had previously been arrested for domestic assault and was convicted of sex crimes against an underage victim. Munoz-Guatemala was also convicted of driving without a valid license and was charged multiple times for driving illegally. DHS said ICE first lodged a detainer on him in 2013.",
      "On Thursday, when speaking to reporters at the White House, Vice President JD Vance scolded the media for not mentioning that the same ICE officer who shot Good was previously seriously injured during the car-dragging incident.",
      "\"The way that the media, by and large, has reported this story has been an absolute disgrace. And it puts our law enforcement officers at risk every single day,\" Vance said. \"What that headline leaves out is the fact that that very ICE officer nearly had his life ended, dragged by a car six months ago, 33 stitches in his leg. So you think maybe he's a little bit sensitive about somebody ramming him with an automobile?\"",

      "Ben Taleblu said the key factor is whether segments of the security forces defect, refuse orders or fragment. \"What has to be chipped away is the regime\u2019s coercive power,\" he said, adding that a transition would require sustained protests, economic strikes and cracks within security units.",

      "While what happens next remains largely uncertain and multiple possibilities continue to be studied by Washington, the celebratory tones seen across the country and throughout the almost 9 million citizens in the diaspora on Saturday have largely subsided into muted and cautious joy only expressed in private circles among those who longed for an end to years of economic hardship and political repression.",

      "Yet fear remains. The government has decreed any celebration of current events \u2014 and even expressions of approval of the U.S. operation in written text messages \u2014 to be a crime equivalent to national treason. Worse yet: it has empowered any law officer to check citizens and their telephones at random at hundreds of checkpoints established throughout Caracas and other regions of the country.",

It\u2019s been extremely difficult having to remain vigilant at all times. From prior experiences, I learned to avoid most checkpoints through alternate ways and avoiding main roads. People have been sending texts saying where the checkpoints are and telling us to delete anything that shows our support for U.S. actions from our phones.\"",
      "He continued, \"For me, personally, it\u2019s a time of mixed feelings. I am relieved to see Maduro gone and finally see a promise or discourse by either local or foreign governments to come to pass in Venezuela. While I obviously understand this only happened because of foreign interference, I much prefer a U.S. action that ends this dictatorship than preserving Venezuela\u2019s sovereignty at the cost of our country. On the other hand, I am also frightened, because once you start dismantling the established structures, you end up having chaos, and in such a case, the population suffers the most.\"",

I am very sorry that this happened in my country and would be lying if I said I agreed with foreign incursions, but I am also of the opinion that our own Armed Forces should have listened to the majority of the citizens in the 2024 elections [when Maduro retained power despite losing the vote], but they chose to continue oppressing their own people. This is, therefore, part of the cost we should pay for their inoperancy,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Two days before Christmas, with federal agents ramping up immigration arrests in Minnesota, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey stepped to a microphone and issued a warning.",
      "\u201cI am increasingly concerned because of the chaos that is being caused by these ICE agents,\u201d Frey said. \u201cSomebody is going to get seriously injured or killed.\u201d",
      "Two weeks later, with some 2,000 federal agents \u2014 more than three times the number of police officers employed by the Minneapolis Police Department \u2014 deployed to the state, that very thing happened. A federal immigration officer fatally shot Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother and U.S. citizen, on Wednesday, unleashing a national furor, pitting federal and local officials against each other and drawing thousands of people to the streets in protest.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s deadly confrontation was the culmination of weeks of intensified scrutiny, verbal attacks and even conspiracy theories directed at Minnesota and Gov. Tim Walz by President Donald Trump, his administration and his allies.",
      "Exactly why the president has been so fixated on Minnesota isn\u2019t totally clear, though local officials and strategists working in state and national politics have pointed NBC News to Trump\u2019s long-running \u2014 and unsuccessful \u2014 attempts to win the state and his personal disdain for Walz. (Trump, however, has repeatedly falsely claimed that he did win the state.) Many said it\u2019s a case of Trump going after deep-blue cities in part due to their immigration policies.",
      "A central focus of the administration\u2019s attacks on Minnesota has also been the Justice Department\u2019s yearslong fraud investigation that has involved some members of Minnesota\u2019s Somali community.",
      "In 2022, during President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, federal prosecutors announced initial indictments in what they called a $250 million scheme to defraud a federal child nutrition program. They described Aimee Bock, who is white, as the mastermind of the operation. A jury convicted her in March. So far, prosecutors have charged 92 people and dozens have been convicted.",
      "But conservative influencers have latched onto the scandal to push unsubstantiated claims, and Trump has used it to make disparaging remarks about people of Somali descent.",
      "For Minnesotans, the result of all this attention has largely been disgust, fury and exhaustion.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re trying to break us,\u201d said Democratic state Rep. Emma Greenman, whose district is roughly a mile from where the shooting occurred. She said she believes the administration targeted the state because it is \u201ca successful story of multiracial democracy and immigration \u2014 and it inherently represents a threat to authoritarian power.\u201d",

      "\u201cI wish they would just leave us the f--- alone,\u201d Democratic Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota told NBC News on Wednesday.",
      "Asked why Trump was so fixated on the state, Smith replied, \u201cI wish I knew.\u201d",
      "'He's never gotten Walz'",
      "Trump has called Walz \u201ccorrupt,\u201d \u201cwhacked out\u201d and \u201cgrossly incompetent.\u201d On Saturday, the president shared a video on social media that promoted a conspiracy theory about a Democratic lawmaker in the state who, along with her husband, was assassinated in June. The video falsely implied that Walz had something to do with the killing.",
      "Trump has also repeatedly made derogatory comments in recent weeks about Somali immigrants in Minnesota, calling them \u201cscammers\u201d and \u201clowlifes.\u201d While the fraud investigation into the use of federal social services funds in Minnesota has received bipartisan support in the past, Somali Americans who run child care facilities, which have been the subject of fresh allegations in the scandal, in the state say they\u2019ve been harassed and threatened since a conservative influencer\u2019s lengthy video on the issue went viral.",
      "Many Democrats in the state have acknowledged that its party leaders have mishandled the situation politically as well. A state audit report released in 2024 found that failures by the state\u2019s Education Department led to the misuse of the Covid-era program.",
      "On Monday, Walz made the surprise announcement that he would no longer be running for re-election amid the scrutiny and pressure.",
      "A former senior White House official who, like others in this article, was granted anonymity to speak candidly, said Trump has long been mystified by why then-Vice President Kamala Harris chose Walz as her running mate in 2024.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s never gotten Walz. Never gotten it,\u201d the official said, saying Trump and his team believed someone like Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro would have been a stronger choice.",
      "For some in Minnesota, what made Good\u2019s shooting especially tragic was that they saw something like it coming. Bringing in federal agents, against the wishes of the state\u2019s political leaders \u2014 and many of its residents \u2014 was a bomb waiting to go off, Frey and Walz said Wednesday.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is the consequences of governance designed to generate fear, headlines and conflict. It\u2019s governing by reality TV, and today that recklessness cost someone their life,\u201d Walz said in a news conference. \u201cNow we hear more political rhetoric. Enough. Enough is enough.\u201d",

      "On Fox News on Wednesday night, Vice President JD Vance declared that Walz should resign. He also made an admission.",
      "\u201cLook, I\u2019ve beaten up on Tim Walz enough. I don\u2019t want to do it anymore on your program,\u201d Vance said. \u201cI almost feel bad for the guy, except for the fact that he should have seen this,\u201d he said, referring to the fraud allegations.",
      "On Thursday, however, Vance joined Leavitt at the press briefing, where he again went after Walz.",
      "\u201cTim Walz is a joke,\u201d he said. \u201cHis entire administration has been a joke, the idea that he\u2019s some sort of freedom fighter. He\u2019s not. He\u2019s a guy who has enabled fraud, and maybe, in fact, has participated in fraud.\u201d There is no evidence that Walz participated in alleged fraud.",
      "Leavitt also said the administration wouldn\u2019t be taking its eye off Minnesota.",
      "\u201cThe Department of Homeland Security will continue to operate on the ground in Minnesota, not only to remove criminal illegal aliens, but also to continue conducting door-to-door investigations of the rampant fraud that has taken place in the state under the failed and corrupt leadership of Democrat Gov. Tim Walz,\u201d she announced.",
      "Tensions, years in the making",
      "Trump\u2019s focus on Minnesota can be traced to 2016, when he first toppled the so-called blue wall and won Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania \u2014 and saw Minnesota as potentially within reach. Republicans have not won Minnesota in a presidential election since 1972.",
      "In the view of one Democratic strategist who has worked in Minnesota, \u201cthe Trump folks thought if they squeezed Minnesota, they could turn it red.\u201d Preya Samsundar, a Minnesota-based Republican strategist, noted Trump\u2019s long-held goal of turning the state red and described the president\u2019s attention and effort as a \u201cpoke in the eye\u201d to Walz.",
      "\u201cI think for a lot of folks, Minnesota is still one of those states that can be attainable with the right effort,\u201d said Samsundar, a former Midwest regional communications director for the Republican National Committee. \u201cI think now a part of the White House\u2019s focus is because Tim Walz was a VP candidate from a state that Trump has wanted to flip for some while.\u201d",
      "Until abandoning his campaign for a third term, Walz had been positioning himself as one of the Democratic Party\u2019s future leaders, \u201cmaking him a convenient person to go after,\u201d Samsundar added.",
      "Indeed, Trump\u2019s criticism of Walz intensified after Harris chose him as her running mate. Trump frequently assailed Walz as a \u201cdangerously liberal extremist.\u201d Walz, for his part, emerged as the Democratic ticket\u2019s chief attack dog against Trump, further attracting his ire.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "After Trump won, he and his allies lumped Minnesota in with other Democratic states that, he said, weren\u2019t aggressive enough on immigration.",
      "Minnesota is home to the nation\u2019s largest Somali population, and most of them are U.S. citizens. Since 1993, thousands of people have fled war and instability in the East African country.",
      "As Trump has ramped up ICE actions across the U.S., the community, mostly based in the Twin Cities, has been the target of the agency\u2019s efforts in Minnesota. And Walz hasn\u2019t held his tongue regarding ICE, slamming it last year as Trump\u2019s \u201cmodern-day Gestapo.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a longtime Walz ally, called the governor to remind him to keep in mind what he was dealing with: a Trump administration that lies, according to a person with knowledge of the conversation.",
      "Pritzker also reupped a playbook he had shared in the past with Walz and other Democratic governors, which was to repeatedly remind his state\u2019s residents that it was their right to protest the government but not to \u201ctake the bait\u201d and descend into violence. That was, Pritzker believed, exactly what the Trump administration wanted so it could declare martial law.",
      "Later Wednesday, Walz conveyed that to his residents, imploring them not to \u201ctake the bait.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey want a show,\u201d Walz said at his news conference. \u201cWe can\u2019t give it to them.\u201d",
      "Unfolding fraud allegations",
      "Meanwhile, a broad fraud scandal has been unfolding in the state involving the alleged misuse of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal welfare funds. The allegations pertain largely to the Somali community. Trump has repeatedly said the Somali community has \u201cdestroyed Minnesota\u201c and \u201cour country,\u201d and his Justice Department is sending additional federal prosecutors to the state to assist the U.S. attorney\u2019s office there with the ongoing investigations into the matter.",
      "Republicans in the state and at the national level have blamed Walz for not taking the allegations seriously.",
      "\u201cThe fraud is a powerful issue because it\u2019s a real-life example of what the majority of Republicans and independents already feel is true \u2014 that their tax dollars are wasted by politicians and people taking advantage of the system,\u201d said Matt Wolking, a longtime GOP strategist who was on Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign.",
      "A state Democratic lawmaker, however, said the Republican attacks all feel \u201cvery personal.\u201d",
      "\u201cDonald Trump has vendettas \u2014 he goes after people. Clearly that\u2019s a piece of this,\u201d the person said.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "\u201cThe city is emotionally fatigued,\u201d added Roy Temple, a national Democratic operative with decades of experience in Minnesota politics, who said that, even six years later, the city is \u201cstill healing\u201d from the George Floyd murder and fallout.",
      "\u201cPeople\u2019s nerves are pretty shot,\u201d Temple said, adding that the ICE raids and the fatal shooting are \u201ctriggering.\u201d",
      "Complicating part of the picture, however, is the scope and potential severity of the allegations of fraud.",
      "Other Democrats in the state agreed with the sentiment that Trump was unfairly attacking many elements of Walz\u2019s record and dumping on the Somali community \u2014 while also acknowledging the possibility that Walz hasn\u2019t handled the situation well.",
      "\u201cThis has been in the air in Minnesota for some time; it\u2019s one of those things that we knew at some point this issue would really kind of percolate to the top. And we\u2019re seeing that happen now, where a spotlight is put on this \u2014 for multiple reasons,\u201d a Minneapolis-based Democratic operative said. The operative added that Walz\u2019s \u201cbiggest problem\u201d with the fraud allegations was that \u201che just didn\u2019t really have any good answers for any of this.\u201d",
      "At a separate hearing in Congress this week on the Minnesota fraud issue, Democrats fumed about the hypocrisy of Trump administration officials who, while complaining about fraud and ICE protests in Democratic areas, pardoned fraudsters aligned with the president as well as those convicted of violence against federal officers on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "Republicans in the state largely defended Trump\u2019s message \u2014 though not necessarily his tone \u2014 expressing solidarity with efforts to unroot fraud and tackle immigration enforcement.",
      "\u201cThe national attention that the president has brought to Minnesota means that people are listening now,\u201d state GOP Chair Alex Plechash said."

    "story": [
      "Bob Weir, a founding member of the Grateful Dead whose rhythm guitar work, songwriting and tireless touring helped push traditional American blues and folk music into the modern era, has died, according to a statement posted Saturday to his official website.",
      "He was 78.",
      "The statement, also posted to social media, said Weir had been diagnosed with cancer in July and beat it but \u201csuccumbed to underlying lung issues.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe transitioned peacefully, surrounded by loved ones, after courageously beating cancer as only Bobby could,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Across more than six decades, Weir was one of music\u2019s true road warriors, performing thousands of shows with almost a dozen bands. And though he often stood figuratively (and sometimes literally) in Jerry Garcia\u2019s shadow, Weir eventually assumed the status of elder statesman of the \u201cjam band\u201d music genre that spun off from the Dead.",
      "Born in San Francisco in 1947, Weir gravitated to folk music in his teenage years. At the age of 16, it was a chance encounter with Garcia in a Palo Alto, California, music store on New Year\u2019s Eve 1963 that would start one of the most important friendships in rock history. Together, Garcia and Weir formed the basis for the Dead\u2019s emergence as not just a band but a counterculture unto itself.",
      "Emerging from the psychedelic scene in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood of San Francisco, Weir\u2019s early days of the Dead are well chronicled as part of the rise of the hippie movement, most notably Ken Kesey\u2019s \u201cAcid Tests,\u201d LSD-fueled parties at which the Dead performed. Though middling in record sales, the Dead\u2019s aggressive touring regimen \u2014 combined with a policy that allowed fans to record shows and trade their favorite recordings \u2014 built a following that would grow organically over the decades.",
      "In the coming years, Garcia and Weir, initially a boyish figure next to his older and usually hairier bandmates, would become the faces of the Dead and its increasingly large cultural footprint. The two shared vocal duties while Weir\u2019s rhythm guitar laid the foundation for Garcia\u2019s now legendary improvisational playing. Weir penned some of the Dead\u2019s most enduring songs, including \u201cJack Straw,\u201d \u201cSugar Magnolia\u201d and \u201cPlaying in the Band.\u201d",
      "The band swerved across the music industry\u2019s established lanes of short pop songs and thematic, marketing-friendly albums to create live, long-form journeys that matched the demands of psychedelia.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t make great records,\u201d Weir said in an interview with journalist Dan Rather. \u201cWe were real good at playing live. And that\u2019s what people wanted.\u201d",
      "Weir\u2019s bond with Garcia formed the core of the Dead, with Weir speaking of Garcia as a big brother.",
      "\u201cThey say that blood is thicker than water, and what we had was way thicker than blood,\u201d Weir said of Garcia and the Dead in the interview with Rather.",
      "The Dead\u2019s enduring popularity through the 1980s and early 1990s, thanks in large part to near-constant touring, kept Weir center stage. With cutoff jeans and tank tops, Weir became the closest thing the counterculture band had to a \u201cheartthrob,\u201d as The New Yorker once put it in a profile of the band.",
      "But Garcia\u2019s health problems began to hamper the band. On Aug. 9, 1995, Weir stepped up to microphones to confirm reports that Garcia had passed away.",
      "For another three decades after Garcia's death, Weir played in various bands, some with other members of the Dead, some without. By the mid-1990s, a new crop of bands including Phish, Widespread Panic, Blues Traveler and many others had built on the Dead\u2019s foundation to deliver various combinations of rock, blues, jazz, bluegrass and folk to live audiences. The jam band movement had taken shape, and Weir would remain firmly a part of it.",
      "That only sustained the popularity of the Dead\u2019s music. In August 2025, Weir\u2019s most recent project, Dead & Company, which included longtime Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart and guitarist John Mayer, drew roughly 180,000 people over three shows at San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Park.",
      "\u201cBob\u2019s return to Golden Gate Park this past summer brought out the best of our city \u2014 music, community, and joy,\" San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said Saturday in a statement on Weir's passing.",
      "Weir received a bevy of honors: Kennedy Center honors and induction to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Dead, the first ever Les Paul Spirit Award winner and a lifetime achievement award from the Americana Honors & Awards.",
      "Dead concert recordings have also maintained a cult following online, where nearly 18,000 digital files with concerts since 1965 are part of the Internet Archive.",
      "And while the Dead were not usually much for politics, Weir increasingly embraced liberal and progressive politics starting in the early 2000s and continuing through later years when he endorsed Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Weir also dedicated time to philanthropic efforts, winning the MusiCare\u2019s Persons of the Year award in 2025 along with Hart.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom and his partner, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, released a joint statement Saturday night calling Weir \"a true son of California\" who \"helped create the soundtrack of a generation.\"",
      "\"What set him apart was not just his music \u2014 it was his deep love for the people who heard it, his ability to connect with audiences as he shared stories that brought joy,\" the couple said. \"Weir was \u2014 and will always be \u2014 a king of psychedelic rock.\"",
      "At the other end of the nation, the Empire State Building was lit up in tie-dye colors to memorialize Weir and the music that that made the counterculture's trademark swirling pigmentation seem to dance.",
      "Se\u00e1n Ono Lennon, son of Yoko Ono and John Lennon, reacted to Weir's death with a brief statement and a photo posted to X: \"He will be missed. Bob Weir R.I.P.\"",
      "The Al Hirschfeld Foundation, a nonprofit that supports cultural institutions in part by using income from exhibits of the late artist's iconic cartoon sketches, posted a photo of an Al Hirschfeld rendition of the Grateful Dead from 1995 as a way to memorialize Weir.",
      "The statement announcing Weir\u2019s death said surviving loved ones Natascha, Monet and Chloe are thankful for the outpouring of love, and asked that their privacy be respected.",
      "Weir is also survived by a handful of Grateful Dead bandmates, including drummers Hart and Bill Kreutzmann.",
      "\u201cThere is no final curtain here, not really,\u201d the statement said. \u201cOnly the sense of someone setting off again. He often spoke of a three-hundred-year legacy, determined to ensure the songbook would endure long after him. May that dream live on through future generations of Dead Heads.\u201d"

      "\u201cHosting the Golden Globes this year was without a doubt the most fun I have ever had in my career,\u201d Glaser said in a statement at the time. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to do it again, and this time in front of the team from \u2018The White Lotus,\u2019 who will finally recognize my talent and cast me in Season 4 as a Scandinavian Pilates instructor with a shadowy past.\u201d",
      "Glaser has been making people laugh ever since college, where she did stand-up. While pursing a degree in English from the University of Kansas, Glaser appeared on the show \u201cLast Comic Standing,\u201d and made it all the way to the finals before she was eliminated.",

      "Glaser made the rounds across celebrity roasts, like for Rob Lowe and Alec Baldwin, before the one that blew up: Netflix\u2019s Tom Brady roast, which aired in 2024.",
      "\u201cThe roast was such a big moment for me, and my life changed overnight in terms of recognizability and people knowing who I am,\u201d she told The Hollywood Reporter.",
      "In fact, Glaser did so well at the event that she joked the audience at the 2025 Golden Globes were \u201cscared\u201d of what she was going to say about her in the opening monologue.",
      "\u201cI think, when I first walked out (to do the opening monologue), I knew the energy was like, \u2018We don\u2019t know what she\u2019s going to do. We\u2019ve seen her do the Tom Brady roast, most recently.\u2019 That\u2019s kind of where I popped for most people,\u201d Glaser said during a conversation at the Time100 Summit on April 23.",

      "The 46-year-old actor, who has been married to Schwarzenegger\u2019s daughter Katherine Pratt Schwarzenegger since 2019, recently stopped by \u201cThe Graham Norton Show\u201d in the UK and chatted about how he spent Christmas with his family.",
      "When host Graham Norton prompted Pratt to share how much his father-in-law loves Christmas, the \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d actor replied, \u201cHis love language is giving gifts, that\u2019s for sure. He just goes all out with his gifts.\u201d",
      "Pratt continued, \u201cThis year, one was like a six foot by eight foot portrait painting of all three of my children and him as Santa Claus, and it\u2019s very lifelike and it\u2019s very big and it\u2019s him as Santa Claus and then the three kids peering around the Christmas tree seeing him eat a cookie.\u201d",
      "As the audience laughed, Norton quipped that the present couldn\u2019t be on display the entire year.",
      "\u201cYeah, I\u2019m not sure exactly what we\u2019re supposed to do with that for the rest of the year,\u201d Pratt agreed. \u201cI think we\u2019ll have to break that out in November sometime.\u201d",
      "He added that the present is so large it will be difficult to store it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s big. It\u2019s enframed and it\u2019s a big massive canvas,\u201d he explained before also describing the present as \u201ca wonderful decoration\u201d and \u201cvery thoughtful gift\u201d for his family.",
      "The action star and Pratt Schwarzenegger share three children together: 5-year-old daughter Lyla Maria, 3-year-old daughter Eloise Christina and 1-year-old son Ford Fitzgerald. He is also a father to 13-year-old son Jack from his previous marriage to Anna Faris.",
      "Pratt received another unique present from Schwarzenegger, as well.",
      "\u201cHe also gave me a pair of crocodile boots that he wore in a movie,\u201d Pratt revealed. \u201cWe have the same size feet.\u201d",
      "Pratt appeared on \u201cThe Graham Norton Show\u201d with Cynthia Erivo, comedian and writer Dawn French and comedian Rob Becket.",
      "After he shared his personal gift, the two comedians playfully teased him that he just received an old pair of shoes. \u201cThey\u2019re regifted but they are iconic. He wore them in some movie\u2026\u201d Pratt pushed back.",
      "Becket chimed in and joked, \u201cSo iconic you can\u2019t remember the film?\u201d",
      "Pratt has spoken about his close relationship with his father-in-law before. He revealed during an interview with \u201cNew York Live\u201d in 2021 that Schwarzenegger frequently quotes iconic lines from his movies when he is around his family.",
      "\u201cHe does it all the time, too. He\u2019ll say lines from his movies and stuff. He\u2019ll walk out and be like, \u2018I\u2019ll be back,\u2019\u201d he shared. The interview was part of the promotional run for Pratt\u2019s movie \u201cThe Tomorrow War,\u201d which included a scene where he said a slightly different version of that same Schwarzenegger line.",
      "\u201cI showed it in front of the whole family and I said, \u2018I do have a line. I say, I will be back,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll see it just pales in comparison to anytime you\u2019ve ever delivered that iconic line. I\u2019m just saying it like a guy who\u2019s going into the room. There\u2019s nothing iconic about it.\u201d",
      "The respect between the two is mutual as Schwarzenegger proudly gushed about his son-in-law when \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\u201d was released in 2023.",
      "At the time, Schwarzenegger tweeted, \u201cI saw #GuardiansOfTheGalaxyVol3  last night and WOW. @prattprattpratt, you crushed it. A non-stop, perfect mix of comedy and action. I loved it and I\u2019m very, very proud of you.\u201d"

      "The film is a romantic romp, with settings like Barcelona, Tuscany, New Orleans and the woods of Canada, set to a soundtrack consisting of Robyn, Taylor Swift and Paula Abdul. And it hits all the romantic comedy beats: a hilarious miscommunication between Alex and Poppy's dad (played by Alan Ruck), a steamy kiss on a balcony in the pouring rain (the actors say it was actually freezing) and a sprint to profess one's love (through an Ohio neighborhood, rather than an airport).",

      "Emily Bader: About two people who don't meet on vacation?",

So it's like (gesturing between them) these are the people we meet on vacation.",
      "EB: We meet different versions of ourselves. That's it. Canon now.",

Like if we're talking \"When Harry Met Sally...,\" (she's) more Billy Crystal. And I think that's really fun. She's very carefree and takes up all the space that she wants to, which I think is an exciting new interpretation.",
      "TB: I think for Alex, his unique spin is the \"Vacation Alex\" aspect, which is him slowly coming out of his shell because of this person who gives him the power to express himself \u2014\u00a0epitomized by him stripping off and running into the sea.",

      "EB: I think for Poppy, her music taste is also sort of seen in the way that she dresses. She's someone who reacts really strongly to something that she loves, and once she loves it, it's hers forever, even if it makes absolutely no sense in her closet or her catalog of music. And I love that about her. She just, she likes what she likes, and it's all over the map.",

      "For Alex, I think the musical side of him that we didn't see, I've seen him described as a black cat boyfriend. Instead of like a golden retriever, he's more of a black cat. And so I think it's like The Smiths. \"500 Days of Summer\" kind of vibes.",

    "story": [
      "Alan Cumming has returned to his Scottish Castle where 23 celebrities are ready to be sneaky and savage as they face off in Season 4 of \u201cThe Traitors.\u201d",
      "The Emmy-winning Peacock competition series is back with the same murderous game mechanics and a new twist that will keep even the viewers second guessing who they can trust. The first four episodes of Season 4 arrived on Peacock Thursday, Jan. 8 with a supersized premiere that quickly introduced fans to the 23 cast members \u2014 featuring multiple \u201cReal Housewives\u201d alums, Olympians, Survivor winners and more celebrities \u2014 who learned if they have to play the game as a Faithful or a Traitor.",
      "But before they stepped foot into the castle, Cumming announced a new element: he would select a \u201cSecret Traitor\u201d in plain sight in front of everyone. That player\u2019s identity would remain hidden from everyone, including the audience, until later on in the game. He later selected his group of Traitors, and the Faithfuls set off to unmask them.",
      "By the end of Episode 3, multiple players were banished, some were murdered and one Traitor was discovered. Read on for a recap of all the plotting and drama that went down.",
      "Episode 1",
      "The premiere begins with all of the players arriving at the darkened castle. After briefly meeting each other and seeing some familiar faces, they are informed about Cumming\u2019s \u201cSecret Traitor\u201d twist. Each player has a box with their name on it. One by one, they approach Cumming and he shows if their box contains a grim reaper card, confirming them as the Secret Traitor. Their identity is withheld from the audience. Everyone then moves into the castle and gathers around the Round Table for Cumming to choose the other Traitors.",
      "After covertly circling the room multiple times, he selects three Traitors to join his turret: \u201cThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\u201d alum Lisa Rinna, former \u201cThe Real Housewives of Potomac\u201d star Candiace Dillard Bassett and Rob Rausch from \u201cLove Island USA\u201d Season 6. Later in the turret that night, the three learn about the Secret Traitor (who wears a special red cloak) and their power. Every week, the Secret Traitor creates a shortlist of players to be murdered until all the Traitors have the chance to team up.",
      "The first mission requires the cast to divide into groups of three and find coffins marked with dollar signs in a loch. The coffins are then placed in one of the player\u2019s graves, meaning they are at risk for murder. At the end, nine players are on the chopping block.",
      "Back at the mansion, \u201cThe Real Housewives of Atlanta\u201d star Porsha Williams confronts actor Michael Rapaport after hearing from Dillard Bassett that he wanted to target all the housewives. But Dillard Bassett says that Williams misheard her, leading to more confusion. Cumming announces at the end of the episode to the audience that the Secret Traitor chose four out of the nine at risk players to be on the shortlist for murder. The three Traitors receive a letter from the Secret Traitor with the four names: Rausch, Ian Terry from \u201cBig Brother,\u201d Mark Ballas from \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d and singer-songwriter Eric Nam.",
      "Episode 2",
      "The episode opens with \u201cThe Traitors\u201d tradition of having each player arrive for breakfast except one. Viewers discover that the Traitors chose to murder Ian Terry. In his final confessional, a disappointed Terry says, \u201cI had a feeling that was going to be the case. I just don\u2019t know what I could\u2019ve done differently. But, you know what, this is the biggest backhanded compliment in this game.\u201d",
      "Before the players depart for the second mission, Williams slips up again by accidentally saying that she \u201ckilled\u201d Terry, causing comedian Ron Funches\u2019 ears to perk up. At the mission, more drama unfolds, this time between \u201cSurvivor\u201d winner Yamil \u201cYam Yam\u201d Arocho and \u201cLove Island\u201d UK star Maura Higgins. The players have to transport three players on a throne back to the castle. Along the way, they have to make multiple stops and collect gold or shields. The last players on the throne when they reach the castle will be safe from murder. Arocho takes Higgins' spot on the throne, securing his safety for the night, and Rapaport inserts himself in the conversation by claiming that he also needed a shield. He continues to call out Arocho in front of everyone when they return to the mansion. Meanwhile, Williams errs again by mentioning that there are four Traitors, adding to the list of evidence Funches is compiling.",
      "At the first Round Table, \u201cSurvivor\u201d winner Natalie Anderson kicks things off by explaining why she thinks Donna \u201cMama\u201d Kelce is a Traitor. But Funches\u2019 theory about Williams is more compelling. It is a close vote, but Williams receives one more vote than Kelce and is banished. While standing on the Circle of Truth, Williams says, \u201cI came in and I tried to fight for the housewives and it almost started to feel like I\u2019m going to be the one who is going to help to lead us to find a Traitor the first time. I am a Faithful.\u201d The group is stunned and Funches says in his confessional that he feels like he put a target on his back.",
      "Toward the end of Episode 2, the Traitors are tasked with completing a covert murder in plain sight. The Traitors must find a set of tarot cards hidden in the kitchen that reveal the second shortlist from the Secret Traitor. Next, they have to take the card of the person they want to murder and burn it in the fireplace in the breakfast room. If successful, they can meet the Secret Traitor and unite. If unsuccessful, there will not be a murder that night and they will not have any control over the next murder.",
      "Rausch spots the red reaper painting in the kitchen and instantly knows that is where the tarot cards are hidden. Meanwhile, Dillard Bassett starts a Conga line to distract the rest of the players. But \u201cSurvivor\u201d star Rob Cesternino isn\u2019t fooled. He tells \u201cBig Brother\u201d alum Tiffany Mitchell that he suspects a murder is happening in plain sight and she needs to stay alert. He also shares this theory with Dillard Bassett and Ballas.",
      "Rausch takes the tarot cards to Rinna and they discuss the shortlist: \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d star Mon\u00e9t X Change, Olympic figure skater Tara Lipinski, \u201cTop Chef\u201d host Kristen Kish and Cesternino. The two Traitors slip away to the breakfast room, without having time to consult with Dillard Bassett, and burn one card, murdering a player.",
      "Episode 3",
      "All the players safely arrive to breakfast the next morning except one: Cesternino. We see a flashback where he learned his fate. \u201cI don\u2019t know how they got me. I leave with no regrets. Traitors, I\u2019ll get you next time,\u201d he says.",
      "Rapaport abruptly starts targeting Arocho again about the shield from the last mission, rubbing multiple players the wrong way. Cumming arrives and shocks the players by sharing that there will be a morning Round Table meeting and banishment. Many of the players meet and agree that they will vote for Kelce to be banished. Kelce attempts to defend herself and suggests that Rapaport is a Traitor.",
      "But the players stand firm on their decision to banish her. They all vote to remove her from the game except Rapaport, who voted for Arocho, and Kelce, who voted for Rapaport.",
      "While standing on the Circle of Truth, Kelce says, \u201cI know I\u2019m the sacrificial lamb and I know that I had a blast meeting every single one of you. On that note, I think I\u2019m going to go \u2026 but you got yourself a Traitor!\u201d",
      "Kelce is then revealed as the Secret Traitor who was chosen by Cumming when they first arrived. The episode \u201crewinds\u201d to show the moments she met in secret with Cumming and planned her shortlists. Kelce says in her confessional that her strategy was to be a lovable mom figure during the day and a \u201cdevious Traitor at night.\u201d She says that she targeted players with her shortlists who were laying low and not speaking up.",
      "Reflecting on her game, she says, \u201cPlaying a Traitor was tough but I gave it my best shot. This has been a dream come true.\u201d Getting emotional, she adds, \u201cThese are happy tears that I get to do this at this point in my life. It\u2019s just the joy of being in the game.\u201d",
      "Cumming asks each player to pair up with the person they trust most. Funches is the odd person out, so he will be automatically shortlisted for murder. The duos select one person to be put in a cage and another to hunt for skulls and stack them in a tower. Kish, \u201cThe Real Housewives of Dubai\u201d star Caroline Stanbury, Rinna and Nam\u2019s partners are all unsuccessful which means they are at risk.",
      "The at-risk players are left behind and tied to trees where they wait to find out if they will be murdered by the Traitors face to face. After making their decision in the turret, the Traitors go to the woods and meet with each player. Nam pleads for his life in the game. Kish says she won\u2019t beg. Stanbury says she isn\u2019t ready to go and Funches threatens the Traitors.",
      "He says if they don\u2019t kill him now they will regret it later. \u201cShow me your faces!\u201d he shouts as the episode ends.",
      "Episodes 4 and 5 of \u201cThe Traitors\u201d Season 4 will stream on Peacock Thursday, Jan. 15 at 6 p.m. PT/ 9 p.m. ET."

      "On Jan. 7, 2025, a fire blazed through the Eaton canyon, making its way towards the mountain town of Altadena. On the far west side of Los Angeles, the Palisades fire was also blazing and wreaking havoc. A total of 31 people died and the fires destroyed about 13,000 homes and residential properties, leaving thousands displaced.",
      "To pay tribute to the lives, homes and businesses lost, the one-night benefit concert brought the Altadena community together in hopes of raising money for the Altadena Builds Back Foundation. The organization helps provide resources and options for people who want to stay and rebuild in Altadena.",
      "\u201cWe were all affected in different ways. Every person in Altadena was affected at once, but everyone\u2019s stories are unique and different,\u201d co-producer and co-organizer Kevin Lyman, the creator of Warped Tour and longtime Altadena resident, tells TODAY.com. \u201c(We are) united under one tragedy.\u201d",
      "Approached by Dawes and guitarist Eric Krasno, Lyman teamed up with the two and began producing a show to support the community, raise funds and provide 250 tickets to Altadena residents directly impacted by the fire.",
      "The support was immediate. Everyone who helped with the production, Lyman says, were friends who became \u201cextended family.\u201d The participants also had ties to Altadena, Palisades or Los Angeles and were impacted by the fires.",
      "\u201cI think in Altadena now, we\u2019re all an extended family,\u201d Lyman says, before noting the similarities between rebuilding the town and producing a show for the community. \u201cIt\u2019s such a huge undertaking that if you look at it as a whole, it\u2019s overwhelming... And all we want to do is bring people together.\u201d",
      "Hosted by actor and Altadena resident John C. Reilly, taking the stage during the over three-hour event was Taboo from Black Eyed Peas, who performed \u201cStand Strong,\u201d his song with his daughter Jett Gomez. Jenny Lewis, Ozomatli, Everclear, Aloe Blacc, Rufus Wainwright, Lord Huron, Judith Hill and Lucius were also part of the line up.",
      "Mandy Moore performed her early hit single \u201cCandy\u201d alongside husband Taylor Goldsmith, singer and guitarist of Dawes. The \u201cThis Is Us\u201d star and her family\u2019s home was impacted by the fire, with her in-laws and family losing their houses.",
      "Earlier in the day, Moore had expressed how grateful she was to give back to her town after so much \u201ctrauma and grief.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy heart is with everyone affected: the lives that were lost and the lives that were forever changed on both sides of our beautiful city,\u201d she wrote on Instagram, in part. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for the chance to gather tonight and celebrate how resilient Altadena is; to be in community with one another and MUSIC to commemorate what we\u2019ve lived through and what comes next. I am endlessly grateful to those near and far who supported Los Angeles in our time of need. The work has only just begun but we\u2019re in it together. Altadena forever.\u201d",
      "Brad Paisley played guitar with several artists and performed his song with Dawes, \u201cRaining Inside.\u201d Brandon Flowers from The Killers also helped close out the show before Dawes concluded the event with all their friends.",
      "Speakers from Habitat For Humanity, as well as Altadena Girls, also participated in the event, expressing uplifting words and preaching \u201cAltadena Strong.\u201d Students from Pasadena Waldorf School, which is permanently closed after being damaged by the fire, attended, too.",
      "With rebuilding efforts slowly happening, and only about 10 homes rebuilt so far, according to The Associated Press, the event was able to raise more than $450,000 for the Altadena Builds Back Foundation. There is still an online auction happening through Feb. 21.",
      "\u201cI walk out of my house and I start hearing hammers and I hear saws and I hear trucks coming... (It\u2019s) the sound of rebuilding. That\u2019s how you build a song, one note at a time,\u201d Lyman tells TODAY.com. \u201cThen it becomes, hopefully, something people love \u2014 and that\u2019s what Altadena will become again. It\u2019s going to change... It never will be (the same), but that\u2019s OK.\u201d"

      "After \"High School Musical\" star Ashley Tisdale penned a scathing first-person essay for The Cut about her \"toxic\" mom group, celebrities have been responding. And they are not, in fact, all in this together.",
      "In her essay, Tisdale wrote how she was initially energized by joining a mom group of friends who happened to be having babies at the same time. Eventually, however, she began to feel left out.",
      "Though Tisdale didn\u2019t name names \u2014 and in fact her rep denied that certain celebrities were part of the clique \u2014 there has been a huge amount of internet speculation about the identity of the other moms in the group.",
      "Meghan Trainor, who has been pegged by internet sleuths as a potential member of Tisdale's former mom crew, shared what seemed like a response to the drama on TikTok on Jan. 8.",
      "The video features an expressionless Trainor typing on a keyboard. The text reads, \"Me finding out about the apparent mom group drama.\" Playing in the background is Trainor's song, \"Still Don't Care,\" highlighting these lyrics: \"Let me take a moment, think it over. Does it touch me at all? Nope, I still don\u2019t care.\"",
      "In her essay, Tisdale wrote, \u201cTo be clear, I have never considered the moms to be bad people. (Maybe one.) But I do think our group dynamic stopped being healthy and positive \u2014 for me, anyway.\u201d",
      "She texted the group that she was leaving because it was getting \u201ctoo high school\u201d for her.",
      "Tisdale, 40, who goes by her married name of Ashley French on her blog, is a mother of two who rose to fame as a child actor in the 2000s on the Disney Channel. Never one to hold back, Tisdale has been outspoken about her personal struggles with mental health, alopecia and breastfeeding.",
      "Responses have been rolling in from other celebrities.",
      "On Jan. 6, Matthew Koma, Hilary Duff's husband, posted a fictional image on his Instagram stories.",
      "The photo looks almost exactly like Tisdale's photo from The Cut: Koma is wearing an almost identical outfit, sitting on a similar-looking off-white couch and striking the same unique pose. The Cut's logo appears in the corner, and the text reads, \"A Mom Group Tell All Through a Father's Eyes: When You're the Most Self Obsessed Tone Deaf Person On Earth, Other Moms Tend To Shift Focus To Their Actual Toddlers.\"",
      "He also included the text: \u201cRead my new interview with @thecut.\u201d",
      "Another Disney Channel star, Christy Carlson Romano, also shared her feelings about mom groups on Instagram on Jan. 6.",
      "Moms of older kids sometimes end up \"cycling out of those friendships, and that kind of sucks,\" Romano said. When the dynamic shifts, moms often find a new group of friends.",
      "\"It's not supposed to be dramatic, but I get it. Sometimes it gets a little crazy and then you write an article about it,\" Romano concludes with a pointed glance at the camera.",
      "Tisdale's husband, Christopher French, shared a cryptic  Instagram message in his stories: \"Underrated life skill: Pausing to decide if it's worth your energy.\" The image was originally posted by @heycoryallen.",

Her death immediately raises questions, especially when it\u2019s revealed that Jack had been having an affair with Rachel the night before she was killed. As Anna pushes to cover the case as a field reporter and Jack leads the investigation, both find themselves under suspicion, locked in a tense game of truth-telling and omission.",

      "Te series frames its central question clearly: Who killed Rachel, and which woman finally snapped?",
      "What Happened to Rachel in High School?",
      "By the finale, the show makes clear it was never about who lost control. It was about who remembered the past and decided to act on it.",
      "That past begins on Anna\u2019s 16th birthday.",
      "Anna, Rachel, Zoe, and Helen were once a tight-knit high-school friend group, inseparable on the surface. That night, under the guise of a celebration, Rachel, the group\u2019s ringleader, lured Anna and an awkward outsider named Catherine Kelly (Astrid Rotenberry) into the woods.",
      "What began as teenage cruelty escalated into something far darker. Older men were brought in. Photos were taken. Catherine managed to escape. Anna didn\u2019t. She was sexually assaulted while the girls she trusted stood by and watched.",
      "The trauma was buried for years, and the girls never told anyone.",
      "Catherine, meanwhile, reinvents herself through massive weight loss and plastic surgery.",
      "Years later, she returns to town under a new name, Lexi Jones (Rebecca Rittenhouse), as a polished, ambitious news anchor who takes over Anna\u2019s job during her absence. Her reappearance ties the violence of the past directly to the present-day investigation, making her a natural suspect, even though she isn\u2019t responsible for the murders.",
      "Who Killed Rachel, Zoe and Helen?",
      "It isn\u2019t until decades later, after Anna loses her three-month-old daughter to sudden infant death syndrome, a tragedy that shatters her marriage and sends her into a year-long disappearance, that the truth fully resurfaces.",
      "While going through old tapes and mementos, Anna\u2019s mother, Mrs. Andrews, discovers footage from that night in the woods and realizes what really happened to her daughter.",
      "For a woman already grieving the loss of her granddaughter and watching her daughter fall apart, the discovery becomes a breaking point.",
      "The series ultimately reveals that Mrs. Andrews is the killer. She fakes dementia to move unnoticed and uses spare keys from her years working as a house cleaner to methodically kill Rachel, Helen, and Zoe, the women she believes destroyed Anna\u2019s life. Each murder is marked by a friendship bracelet, transforming symbols of teenage loyalty into reminders of betrayal.",
      "When Anna reads her mother\u2019s confession in the finale, her reaction is what makes the ending so chilling. She cries and then smiles. She doesn\u2019t turn her mother in. She doesn\u2019t confront her. She accepts what was had been done for her.",
      "Anna then makes her own choice. She never tells Jack the full truth about the woods and that she, not Catherine, had been sexually assaulted. She allows the safer version of the story to stand. And she raises Zoe\u2019s daughter, knowing her own mother killed Zoe, reframing the murder as a twisted attempt to give Anna back the family she lost.",
      "By the final moments, Anna has everything she once wanted: her career, a future, a family.",
      "But it\u2019s built on silence.",
      "\"His & Hers\" doesn\u2019t end by solving a crime. It ends by asking a far darker question, one that lingers long after the credits roll: If the truth only causes more pain, is it still worth telling, or is survival its own form of justice?"

      "\"Heated Rivalry\" has increased interest in professional hockey. Reacting to the show, a representative for the NHL said in a statement, \u201cThere are so many ways to get hooked on hockey and, in the NHL\u2019s 108-year history, this might be the most unique driver for creating new fans.\u201d",
      "\"See you all at the rink,\" the rep added.",
      "\"Heated Rivalry\" Season 1 wrapped up with Episode 6, \"The Cottage,\" on Dec. 26, but fans are still hooked. And Shane and Ilya's story is just beginning. \"Heated Rivalry\" was renewed by Canadian streamer Crave for a second season on Dec. 12."

    "story": [
      "Former reality TV star Spencer Pratt announced that he is running for Los Angeles mayor one year after one of the most destructive wildfires on record in California destroyed his home in Pacific Palisades.",
      "Pratt, husband of fellow ex-reality star Heidi Montag, has been a vocal critic of authorities\u2019 handling of the wildfire, which broke out Jan. 7, 2025, in the community nestled between the Santa Monica Mountains and the Los Angeles County coast. Much of his criticism has been aimed at California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass.",
      "Pratt, 42, spoke Wednesday at a \u201cThey Let Us Burn\u201d rally by the Palisades Fire Residents Coalition to mark one year since the Palisades Fire.",
      "\u201cBusiness as usual is a death sentence for Los Angeles, and I\u2019m done waiting for someone to take real action. That\u2019s why I am running for mayor,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cBut let me be clear, this just isn\u2019t a campaign \u2014 this is a mission, and we are going to expose the system. We are going into every dark corner of L.A. politics and disinfecting the city with our light.",
      "\u201cL.A. is going to be camera-ready again,\u201d he continued.",
      "Pratt became a regular on \u201cThe Hills,\u201d after he and cast member Montag began dating. The couple married in 2008 and they have two children. The couple also appeared on \u201cI\u2019m a Celebrity\u2026 Get Me Out of Here\u201d and the British version of \u201cCelebrity Big Brother.\u201d",
      "On the day the Palisades Fire started, Pratt shared video of the flames and smoke. The couple later documented the extent of the destruction and what they lost.",
      "On the morning of Jan. 7, the Palisades Fire erupted and quickly spread to thousands of acres. Fanned by powerful Santa Ana winds that had been in the weather forecast for days, the 23,700-acre fire became the ninth-deadliest and third-most destructive wildfire on record in California.",
      "Twelve deaths were reported in connection with the Palisades Fire, which destroyed more than 6,800 structures.",
      "Incumbent Bass, former Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent Austin Beutner and more than a dozen other candidates are in the race for mayor. The primary election is scheduled for June 2.",
      "The first day to file a declaration of intention to become a candidate is Feb. 2. The last day to file is Feb. 7.",
      "Bass was elected mayor in a 2022 race against Los Angeles businessman and developer Rick Caruso.",

      "Iran\u2019s Prosecutor-General Mohammad Movahedi Azad said Saturday that protesters would be considered an \u201cenemy of God,\u201d a death-penalty charge in Iran, in remarks reported by Iran\u2019s semiofficial Tasnim news agency.",
      "The news agency also reported that 100 people had been arrested in Tehran province for \u201cdisrupting public order\u201d and leading riots.",
      "The demonstrations, which started almost two weeks ago with economic grievances as the currency crashed and inflation soared, have now morphed into one of the biggest challenges the Islamic Republic has faced in its 47-year history, with thousands of people hitting the streets in large and small cities across the country to demand the ouster of the ruling clergy.",
      "Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in the country, drew a hard line in a fiery speech on Friday and said that the Islamic Republic would not back down in the face of internal protests or external pressure, a position that will likely drive the security forces to lash out even more violently against demonstrators, analysts say.",
      "\u201cRight now, we are very concerned that after the internet shutdown, the brutality will increase,\u201d Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, director of the Norway-based group Iran Human Rights, told NBC News in a telephone interview.",

      "Zahedan, home to a large community of Iran\u2019s ethnic Baluch minority, was also a hotbed of protests in 2022 where several protesters were shot by security forces after Friday prayers in what came to be known as \u201cbloody Friday.\u201d",

      "The violence in Iran comes as Trump again issued a warning to the country\u2019s leaders on Friday not to kill protesters.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve made the statement very strongly that if they start killing people like they have in the past, we will get involved,\u201d he said at a meeting with oil executives that was attended by journalists. \u201cWe\u2019ll be hitting them very hard where it hurts. And that doesn\u2019t mean boots on the ground, but it means hitting them very, very hard where it hurts.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump told reporters Saturday that Rodr\u00edguez had been \u201csworn in\u201d as president and stood \u201cwilling to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again.\u201d Rodr\u00edguez has sent mixed signals, however, insisting that Maduro remains Venezuela\u2019s \u201conly president,\u201d while also pledging to \u201ccollaborate\u201d with the Trump administration.",

      "CARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 Political reality is settling in for Venezuela as the regime once led by deposed President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro tightens its hold on the country.",
      "Many Venezuelans opposed to Maduro\u2019s rule were overjoyed when U.S. special forces captured him over the weekend, believing this would be quickly followed by a transition to a form of a new government. But for some, these hopes have dimmed in recent days.",
      "No political prisoners appear to have been released, and the government is cracking down on any new signs of dissent, arresting people they said celebrated Maduro\u2019s capture by the United States military. The country\u2019s security and intelligence apparatus is out in force, with masked paramilitary \u201ccolectivos\u201d \u2014 armed civilians who support the government \u2014 roaming the streets on motorcycles, and military intelligence agents in civilian clothes circulating in vans with an official insignia and setting up roadblocks. The entire top leadership remains intact, with the notable exception of Maduro himself.",
      "The lack of change in government was underlined by a recent classified intelligence assessment that determined that top members of the Maduro regime \u2014 including former Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, sworn in as interim president on Monday \u2014 were best positioned to lead Venezuela\u2019s government and maintain stability.",
      "That assessment factored in President Donald Trump\u2019s dismissal of Maria Corina Machado, the exiled opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner, as the best person to take over running the country, sources told NBC News.",

      "\u201cFor many years I wished for my country\u2019s government to change, and I thought that when that day came I would feel very happy. But that\u2019s not the case,\u201d said the 34-year-old architect, who moved back to Venezuela last year. \u201cSomehow we will have to pay: either with oil or with our own dignity and sovereignty.\u201d",
      "Michelle and others who spoke to NBC News in Venezuela asked not to be fully identified out of fear the government would punish them.",
      "\u201cA dangerous precedent is being created between the United States and Latin America,\u201d Michelle said. \u201cWe realize that we are just another piece on the board in the struggle between powers, for whom the future of the Venezuelan people lacks relevance compared to the importance of valuable resources, which are worth more than life itself.\u201d",

On Tuesday he said Venezuela would \u201cbe turning over\u201d up to 50 million barrels of oil to the U.S., adding that the revenue from the oil will be used to benefit both Americans and Venezuelans.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s like eating a pizza \u2014 they go slice by slice. We have to trust the process,\u201d the political activist and human rights defender living in exile told NBC News. Confusion surrounds the fate of the 800 to 900 political prisoners who remain incarcerated after the presidential elections on July 28, 2024.",
      "Mata, 26, was one of the thousands of volunteers who safeguarded vote tallies during the 2024 vote. The Maduro government overturned what independent election observers, rights groups and foreign governments said was a resounding opposition victory.",
      "Days after the election, Mata was detained by police officers as he tried to leave the city where he lived after hearing the government was looking for people who safeguarded the votes. He was charged with seven crimes and spent four months imprisoned in Tocor\u00f3n jail. He is now outside Venezuela.",
      "\u201cMany say the United States wants to seize the oil, but the United States is a trade ally. The United States supports freedom in Venezuela,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cFor me, change is closer than ever. Nicol\u00e1s is out of the country and will never set foot in Venezuela again,\u201d added Mata, who asked that NBC News not reveal his location out of security reasons. \u201cFreedom is about to arrive.\u201d",
      "Whether or not \u201cfreedom\u201d is about to sweep across Venezuela, the old regime is intent on projecting continuity. A striking symbol of this was when Delcy Rodr\u00edguez was sworn in as president and the country\u2019s leadership marched shoulder-to-shoulder in front of the National Assembly on Monday.",
      "In the photograph released by the presidential palace, Rodr\u00edguez is flanked on one side by her brother and the president of the National Assembly, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez. On her right is Diosdado Cabello, who as minister of the interior minister, justice and peace oversees police, counterintelligence forces and the \u201ccolectivos\u201d that have struck fear among many Venezuelans. Also surrounding her are seen minister of defense Vladimir Padrino, in full formal military uniform, and a smiling Nicol\u00e1s Maduro Guerra, the son of the ousted leader.",
      "The image runs counter to repeated statements by Trump asserting that the U.S. is \u201cin charge\u201d in Venezuela.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re going after anybody who potentially supported the U.S. mission to get Maduro,\u201d James Story, the last U.S. ambassador to Venezuela, said at an event hosted by the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based think tank.",

      "Marlenis, a domestic worker in Caracas, doesn\u2019t seem too worried about Trump\u2019s plans for Venezuela. She says that after 25 years of a system that has made her poorer every day, Venezuelans have nothing to lose by trying something different.",
      "\u201cWhat else can we lose?\u201d she said, while waiting for the bus to go home after work. \u201cIf everything goes badly, people are already used to bad things.\u201d"

      "On Friday afternoon at an eastern Caracas social club \u2014 one of many private organizations resembling small country clubs \u2014 three mothers watched their children play, and discussed whether they should send them to school on Monday when they are due to reopen after the Christmas break.",

All this in a country that sits on the world\u2019s largest known oil reserves.",
      "While he cited a desire to stamp out groups that control Venezuela\u2019s illicit drug trade, which have seeped into the government, Trump has also repeatedly made clear his interest in the country\u2019s oil.

      "But there may be little they can do to stop it.",
      "\u201cThis is a threat that is completely appalling, to be honest,\u201d Aaja Chemnitz, one of two Greenlandic lawmakers in the Danish parliament, said in an interview Thursday. \u201cYou can\u2019t just buy another country, a people, the soul of Greenland,\u201d she added.",
      "\u201cEverybody in Greenland is discussing it, and many people are worried and concerned.\u201d",
      "That alarm is shared across European capitals.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron accused the United States on Thursday of \u201cbreaking free from the international rules that it used to promote,\u201d while German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier warned the world risked descending into a \u201cden of robbers, where the most unscrupulous take whatever they want.\u201d",
      "Though it looms artificially large on a Mercator projection map, where it is stretched to the scale of Africa despite being 14 times smaller in size, Greenland has rarely figured so prominently in mainstream Western consciousness.",
      "The vast island \u2014 around the size of Alaska and California combined \u2014 is only inhabited by 57,000 people, about the same as Carson City, Nevada. Around 90% of them are Indigenous Inuit people whose ancestors arrived more than 1,000 years ago.",
      "Denmark colonized Greenland 300 years ago and granted it the status of an autonomous territory in the 1970s, while retaining control of military and foreign policy.",
      "American designs on Greenland go back way further than Trump. In 1867, then-Secretary of State William H. Seward contemplated annexing Greenland, as well as Iceland, having recently bought Alaska from Russia.",
      "The United States briefly took control of Greenland during World War II to stop it from being used by the Nazis, and an agreement has existed since 1951 that allows the U.S. to \u201cconstruct, install, maintain, and operate\u201d military bases across the island.",
      "Greenland\u2019s sole U.S. military base was used as an early detection post for Soviet nuclear missiles during the Cold War, home to thousands of troops at its peak. Locked in by ice for nine months of the year, the Pituffik base is now overseen by the U.S. Space Force and houses a much smaller number of troops.",
      "When Trump first said he wanted to buy Greenland in 2019, in what he described as a \u201creal estate deal,\u201d it was widely seen internationally as absurd.",
      "But after years of pressure from Trump, and the U.S. attack on Venezuela, few in Europe are laughing.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio will meet with the foreign ministers from Denmark and Greenland next week for further discussions, as officials push for a deal.",
      "But the White House says that all options are on the table, including military action. An attack by NATO\u2019s most powerful member on an ally would likely implode the alliance, which for decades has upheld the principle of collective defense.",
      "\u201cWe are going to do something on Greenland, whether they like it or not, because if we don\u2019t do it, Russia or China will take over Greenland, and we\u2019re not going to have Russia or China as a neighbor,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to allow Russia or China to occupy Greenland, and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen if we don\u2019t own it,\u201d he said during the public portion of a meeting with oil and gas executives.",
      "European powers including Britain, France and Germany said in a joint statement this week they \u201cwill not stop defending\u201d the principles of territorial integrity, but most experts agree with White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller\u2019s blunt assessment that \u201cnobody\u2019s going to fight the U.S. over the future of Greenland.\u201d",
      "The European Union could impose sanctions on Washington, or limit its use of military bases in Europe, but both would be mutually painful in the extreme, said Mika Aaltola, a Finnish lawmaker who serves on the European Union\u2019s Foreign Affairs Committee.",
      "\u201cWe are basically in a trap that is difficult to resolve,\u201d Aaltola told NBC News. \u201cWe thought that January would be about peace deals or a cease-fire in Ukraine,\u201d he said, referring to diplomatic efforts between the U.S. and Europe to end that conflict. \u201cBut all of a sudden, we realized that Trump has manipulated us into a situation where he wants to have Greenland.\u201d",
      "Iain Duncan Smith, a veteran British lawmaker, said \u201cthe reality for Europe is they need to probably offer an alternative to the demand that Trump is making.\u201d",
      "There is bafflement alongside the dismay. Trump already has huge scope to build new military bases on Greenland or negotiate deals for its minerals, but he has refused to compromise on his demand for \"ownership\" to be transferred.",
      "He said Friday: \"When we own it, we defend it. You don\u2019t defend leases the same way. You have to own it.\u201d",
      "Aside from being a good outpost from which to keep an eye on Russia, Greenland also forms one side of the \u201cGIUK gap\u201d (which stands for Greenland, Iceland, United Kingdom), a naval choke point for submarines and other vessels in and out of the Atlantic.",
      "As the global ice sheet melts, new Arctic sea routes are emerging that Trump\u2019s team and other Western officials fear could be exploited by China and Russia.",
      "Beijing has certainly made moves in the region, declaring itself in 2019 to be a \u201cnear Arctic nation\u201d and outlining plans for a \u201cPolar silk road\u201d to mirror the infrastructure belt it has constructed on land.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt pointed to this motive Wednesday, saying U.S. ownership of Greenland was required \u201cto deter Russian and Chinese aggression in the Arctic region,\u201d though she said there would be \u201cmany other benefits.\u201d",
      "Vice President JD Vance cited Greenland\u2019s continued role in missile defense infrastructure in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, criticizing what he said was a lack of investment from Denmark and Europe that left it vulnerable to potential threats from \u201cthe Russians and the Chinese.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey haven\u2019t done a good job of securing that area, that land mass,\u201d he said.",
      "Denmark's ambassador to the U.S., Jesper M\u00f8ller S\u00f8rensen, said the country has recently invested $4 billion in Arctic security, including expanding the permanent presence of its armed forces.",
      "The retreating ice floes may also yield new opportunities to exploit its vast mineral reserves, a subject that has proven to be at the forefront of Trump\u2019s mind in negotiations over Ukraine and Venezuela.",
      "In 2023, the European Commission carried out a survey that found 25 of the 34 elements it classified as \u201ccritical raw materials\u201d were found on Greenland. These substances are crucial in producing everything from electric vehicle batteries to cutting-edge military hardware \u2014 vital currency in the global tech battle with China and others.",
      "Trump himself has denied minerals are a factor, positioning Greenland as a \u201cnational security\u201d issue, though some around him are eager to take advantage.",
      "\u201cThis is about critical minerals. This is about natural resources,\u201d then-congressman Mike Waltz, who would later become Trump\u2019s national security adviser, said last January.",
      "The reality is likely a mix of all these factors, according to William Alberque, former director of NATO\u2019s Arms Control, Disarmament and WMD Non-Proliferation Centre.",
      "\u201cGreenland is a toxic combination of issues in terms of this administration\u2019s interests,\u201d Alberque said. \u201cIt brings together the China hawks, the legitimate concerns about Atlantic security, the America Firsters and continental security, and let\u2019s not forget naked economic interests.\u201d"

      "BOGOT\u00c1, Colombia \u2014 Colombian officials began frantically calling Republicans in Congress seeking help to prevent a feared U.S. attack after President Donald Trump issued searing comments about their country\u2019s leader in the wake of the raid that captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, a senior Colombian official tells NBC News.",
      "Aboard Air Force One on Sunday, Trump called his Colombian counterpart, Gustavo Petro, \u201ca sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States,\u201d adding: \u201cAnd he\u2019s not going to be doing it very long.\u201d",
      "Petro, a former Marxist revolutionary and one of the few Latin American leaders willing to vocally criticize Trump, on Tuesday said the American president had a \u201csenile brain.\u201d",
      "The Colombians asked members of Congress to help set up a phone call between Petro and Trump, which the Colombian government had wanted for some time. The official said the mediation paid off, with the two leaders speaking by phone on Wednesday, shortly before Petro was set to lead nationwide demonstrations in support of the country\u2019s sovereignty.",
      "The Trump-Petro call resulted in a dramatic de-escalation in tensions between the two men, with both leaders praising each other and announcing plans for a meeting in Washington next month.",
      "Colombia\u2019s Defense Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez told NBC News on Thursday that he planned to travel to Washington along with Petro to meet with American officials \u2014 and that he no longer had concerns the U.S. would launch a military attack on his country.",
      "\u201cI trust in the word of the president of the United States,\u201d he said, adding that the conversation had been a crucial \u201cicebreaker\u201d for the two leaders and countries.",
      "Something Trump said on the call made a particular impression on Petro, the Colombian leader said in a Thursday interview with NBC News partner Telemundo.",
      "\u201cI know you have been surrounded by lies like I have,\u201d Petro said Trump had told him during a  55-minute telephone conversation.",
      "In a Truth Social post sent a short while later, Trump wrote that it had been a \u201cGreat Honor to speak with the President of Colombia, Gustavo Petro, who called to explain the situation of drugs and other disagreements that we have had.\u201d",
      "In another post on Friday, Trump said he was looking forward to meeting Petro at the White House in February, adding: \u201cI am sure it will work out very well for Colombia, and the U.S.A., but, cocaine and other drugs must be STOPPED from coming into the United States.\u201d",
      "The White House did not respond to questions about the flurry of calls that preceded the conversation between the two leaders, nor about Trump\u2019s comment to Petro that they both were \u201csurrounded by lies.\u201d",
      "Colombian leaders, including Petro and S\u00e1nchez, appeared  gratified by the language Trump used when describing the conversation."

Iran\u2019s judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei vowed separately that punishment for protesters \u201cwill be decisive, maximum and without any legal leniency,\u201d according to The Associated Press.",

Dozens have already been killed in a violent crackdown by security forces.",

      "He evaded a question about whether Putin had called him following the seizure. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say that,\u201d Trump said.",
      "The U.S. seized two oil tankers off the coast of Venezuela last month as part of its blockade. The Bella 1 was one of a number of sanctioned oil tankers operating near Venezuela that have recently changed their flags to Russia.",

Analysts have questioned the weapon's utility, and its deployment  appeared to be the Kremlin's latest attempt to send a threatening message to Kyiv and the West with peace talks stalled.",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry said early Friday that it had carried out the \u201cmassive strike\u201d against critically important targets in response to an alleged Ukrainian drone strike late last year on a residence used by President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",

      "\u201cAny terrorist actions by the criminal Ukrainian regime will continue to be met with a response,\u201d the ministry said.",
      "In addition to the Oreshnik medium-range ballistic missile, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the nationwide attack involved nearly 250 drones and dozens of ballistic and cruise missiles. At least four people, including a paramedic, died in Kyiv, Zelenskyy said in a post on X.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw the U.S. from international organizations affiliated with the United Nations leaves the country without a meaningful voice in global climate talks.",
      "In an executive order Wednesday, Trump suspended U.S. support for 66 international bodies and commissions, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which the U.S. joined in 1992, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which produces the world\u2019s premier climate reports.",
      "In a post on X, the White House said the organizations \u201cno longer serve American interests.\u201d",
      "The move is yet another sign that the Trump administration is abandoning all efforts to fight climate change, rolling back these policies at a time when global warming is making weather disasters more frequent and intense across the country. Extreme events like wildfires, floods and hurricanes already cost the U.S. tens of billions of dollars every year. In 2025, 23 weather and climate events exceeded $1 billion in damages, costing a total of around $115 billion, according to an analysis released Thursday by the nonprofit organization Climate Central.",
      "The withdrawal is an escalation of the U.S.\u2019 rejection of climate diplomacy under Trump, further isolating the country from the global aim of slowing warming and staving off the most catastrophic effects of climate change.",
      "Trump began the process of pulling the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement in January 2025. The accord, signed in 2016, stipulated that the 195 participating nations would work to limit greenhouse gas emissions to ensure that the planet wouldn\u2019t warm more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), with an upper limit of 2 degrees C.",
      "The UNFCCC created the underlying structure that the Paris Agreement later built upon. It was established in 1992 to inventory and begin to address the primary sources of greenhouse gas pollution. President George Bush signed the treaty after the Senate delivered its consent in a two-thirds vote.",
      "If the U.S. completes its exit from the UNFCCC \u2014 a process that takes a year \u2014 it would be the first country ever to do so. Re-entering the UNFCCC treaty would require a new two-thirds vote from the Senate, so Trump\u2019s withdrawal could make it difficult for a future president to rejoin the Paris Agreement.",
      "Withdrawing from the UNFCCC would also leave the U.S. as one of the only nations without representation at international climate talks. Already, the White House declined to send an official delegation to the latest U.N. climate summit, COP30, in Brazil last fall.",
      "\u201cWhen you look at all these conventions and the history of participation, even when countries were not really actively engaged in negotiations, it\u2019s pretty astonishing to walk away from the table and have decisions taken without your input,\u201d said Kristie Ebi, a climate scientist at the University of Washington who has contributed to several Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports.",
      "Previous U.S. administrations have not always been enthusiastic participants in international climate discussions, Ebi added, but they still kept tabs on them.",
      "\u201cPeople showed up, sat in the back and did crossword puzzles and never said a word, but they wanted to hear what the discussions were,\u201d she said. Now, \u201cit\u2019s isolation.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has expressed open hostility for the UNFCCC and other international organizations. In a statement on X, Secretary of State Marco Rubio called them \u201canti-American, useless or wasteful.\u201d",
      "The U.S. will officially exit the Paris Agreement on Jan. 27 \u2014 roughly a year after the Trump administration initiated the nation\u2019s exit from the deal.",
      "However, legal questions remain as to whether Trump has the power to exit the UNFCCC without Congress\u2019 consent.",
      "Jean Su, an attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity who directs its energy justice program, said her organization views the move as illegal.",
      "\u201cThe Constitution has articulated what it takes to get into a treaty, which is two-thirds of the Senate majority, but it is actually silent on what it takes to leave a treaty,\u201d Su said. \u201cThere has not been affirmative case law either way as to whether a president can unilaterally pull out of a treaty that was approved by two-thirds of the Senate. So we are looking at legal action.\u201d",
      "The UNFCCC is the world\u2019s facilitator of global climate negotiations. Each year, a host country organizes a Conference of the Parties (COP), in which all participating nations meet to discuss things like emission targets and how to fund climate action globally. Last year\u2019s meeting focused, in part, on the Amazon rainforest and how to address deforestation and climate effects there. The UNFCCC secretariat helps organize these events, creating a structure and facilitating the meetings.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like hosting the Olympics \u2014 you don\u2019t do that without the organization to help,\u201d Ebi said.",
      "When the U.S. left the Paris Agreement, it created a budget hole for the UNFCCC. Bloomberg Philanthropies, the charity organization of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, stepped in to fill that gap and keep the secretariat operating.",
      "The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), meanwhile, is an independent body designed to provide policymakers with the best science about climate change, its effects and how it could be addressed. This organization\u2019s reports form the scientific understanding for UNFCCC discussions and treaties.",
      "In a statement, Simon Stiell, executive secretary of the UNFCCC, said Trump\u2019s exit \u201cwill leave the US less secure and less prosperous.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe doors remain open for the US to reenter in the future, as it has in the past with the Paris Agreement,\u201d he added.",
      "Throughout his first year in office, Trump has made climate programs a target of dramatic budget cuts. He has called climate change a \u201ccon job,\u201d and the administration has taken steps to scuttle or downplay key climate reports, including the National Climate Assessment. It is working to remove the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s ability to regulate the greenhouse gas pollution that causes global warming.",
      "Former Vice President Al Gore, a climate activist, said Wednesday on X that the Trump administration has been \u201cturning its back on the climate crisis since day one,\u201d accusing it of catering to the interests of the oil industry while \u201cendangering people in America and around the world.\u201d",
      "\u201cBy withdrawing from the IPCC, UNFCCC, and the other vital international partnerships, the Trump Administration is undoing decades of hard-won diplomacy, attempting to undermine climate science, and sowing distrust around the world,\u201d Gore said."

      "The U.S. seizure of a Russian-flagged oil tanker threatened new pressure on the \u201cshadow fleet\u201d that has helped prop up President Vladimir Putin\u2019s economy.",
      "The American operation to take over the Bella 1 in the North Atlantic after a high-seas chase that began off Venezuela was \u201ca gross violation\u201d of maritime law, Russia\u2019s foreign ministry said Thursday. It expressed \u201cregret and concern\u201d over Washington\u2019s \u201creadiness to generate acute international crisis situations.\u201d",
      "The saga has highlighted the mixed response in the country to the fallout from the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "While Moscow officially condemned the attack, its messaging has been restrained.",
      "Russia may be reluctant to anger Trump at a precarious moment for the Ukraine peace talks, especially as his approach to Venezuela appears to validate its view of the world as divided into great-power spheres of influence. And despite the complications for the Kremlin and its war effort, some influential voices have expressed jealousy at the effectiveness of the American operation.",
      "Out of the shadows",
      "After a weekslong chase across the Atlantic, the U.S. took over the Bella 1 on Wednesday in an operation that defied Russian warnings.",
      "The ship had changed its name to the Marinera and hoisted a Russian flag after escaping the U.S. blockade of Venezuela last month.",
      "On the U.S. sanctions list since June 2024, it was a \u201cposter child\u201d for the shadow fleet operations, said Richard Meade, editor-in-chief of Lloyd\u2019s List Intelligence, a maritime data analysis company.",
      "\u201cIt has operated out of Iran, out of Russia, out of Venezuela. It\u2019s done all of it, and it\u2019s done all of it while cycling through various false identities, false flags, with questionable or no insurance. It\u2019s exactly what the shadow fleet is there to do. It\u2019s to operate in the shadows,\u201d Meade told NBC News in a phone interview Thursday.",
      "Ships like it smuggle oil for countries facing international sanctions, such as Venezuela, Russia and Iran, and often conceal or spoof their location data. Many are barely seaworthy and often engage in ship-to-ship transfers of their cargo while at sea in an effort to obscure the oil\u2019s origin.",
      "Data from the International Maritime Organization ship registry shows that the tanker\u2019s registered owner is a company called Burevestmarine LLC, headquartered in Russia\u2019s western Ryazan region. The company appears in Russia\u2019s state commercial register and lists Ilya Bugai as the company\u2019s director. NBC News could not immediately identify a way to contact Bugai.",
      "Russia has faced a slew of new sanctions in the aftermath of its invasion of Ukraine, including on its oil. It has resorted to using the shadow fleet to sell its discounted crude oil to allies to keep afloat its economy, which has required enormous military investment to sustain the war.",
      "According to the Kyiv School of Economics\u2019 year-end analysis, Russia\u2019s shadow fleet continues to play a key role in transporting Russian oil. Its \u201cRussian Oil Tracker\u201d estimates that 173 Russian shadow fleet tankers carrying crude oil and oil products departed Russian ports and engaged in ship-to-ship transfers in the month of November.",
      "For years, Kyiv has been calling for a greater crackdown on Russia\u2019s shadow fleet.",
      "\u201cPutin uses these tankers to finance his war, and most of these vessels are old, poorly maintained, and operate without any oversight,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in late 2024. His foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said Wednesday that Ukraine welcomed the tanker\u2019s seizure and Trump\u2019s \u201cact, not fear\u201d approach.",
      "And while the seizure of the Bella 1 is unlikely to break the Russian economy, it adds a layer of complexity for the Kremlin and leaves the fate of other tankers uncertain.",
      "At least three other sanctioned oil tankers that were operating near Venezuela in recent weeks have also changed their flags to Russia\u2019s, according to the Russian Maritime Register of Shipping.",
      "\u201cRussia is increasingly taking direct control of its export capabilities,\u201d said Meade. \u201cAnd certainly in the last four months, we have seen a rapid increase of shadow fleet ships flagging to Russia. Now, given that they were unable to protect the Marinera, the question is, Will shadow fleet operators be quite so willing to move into Russia, and will Russia really want to keep pursuing that agenda of taking direct control of the shadow fleet?\u201d",
      "A lot now depends on whether the U.S., and to some extent the European Union and the U.K., are going to be prepared to execute seizures like the one conducted on Wednesday to try and disrupt those exports via shadow fleet ships.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know whether this was an anomaly or the start of a pattern of more robust enforcement,\u201d Meade said.",
      "What it means for Ukraine",
      "That uncertainty could be the reason behind Russia\u2019s muted response to the tanker seizure so far.",
      "While some Russian lawmakers have called it \u201cpiracy on the high seas,\u201d Russia\u2019s foreign ministry appealed for \u201chumane\u201d treatment of the tanker\u2019s crew even as it urged Washington \u201cto return to compliance with the fundamental norms and principles of international maritime navigation\u201d on Thursday.",
      "There has been no reaction from the Kremlin\u2019s spokesperson or Putin himself.",
      "Moscow may want to be careful not to offend Trump while he is negotiating a peace deal in Ukraine that at times has seen him support Russia\u2019s hard-line demands.",
      "It could also explain why Putin has not personally addressed the U.S. attack on Venezuela.",
      "The operation to remove Maduro is a blow to the Kremlin, depriving it of a longtime ally. But what Moscow\u2019s foreign ministry condemned as an \u201cact of armed aggression\u201d left some of its influential military bloggers jealous of Washington\u2019s success.",
      "When Putin invaded Ukraine in February 2022, he hoped to take Kyiv and capture Zelenskyy in as little as three days, expecting little resistance from Ukraine's army. His plan centered on seizing the Hostomel airfield, a crucial staging post for an assault on the capital, but Putin\u2019s forces got bogged down and eventually withdrew.",
      "Trump\u2019s removal of Maduro, which took hours and resulted in no U.S. deaths, drew admiration and unfavorable comparisons from Russia\u2019s so-called \u201cZ bloggers.\u201d",
      "\u201cMost likely, our own special military operation was conceived in much the same way: fast, effective,\u201d wrote prominent channel Two Majors, referring to the Kremlin\u2019s term for its war in Ukraine. Another prominent Z-blogger, Voenny Osvedomitel, called it a \u201cmodel military operation.\u201d",
      "Still, the focus on Venezuela could help distract from Putin\u2019s reticence to strike a deal with Ukraine.",
      "And Trump\u2019s stated desire to dominate the Western Hemisphere lends validation to the ideas underpinning the Kremlin\u2019s war: that great powers should be entitled to spheres of influence. In Putin\u2019s eyes, at least, Russia\u2019s sphere includes former Soviet states like Ukraine."

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on Capitol Hill that the tankers were seized as part of \"stabilization\" efforts for Venezuela.",

      "The U.S. seized two oil tankers off the coast of Venezuela last month as part of its blockade of sanctioned oil shipments to and from the country. The Marinera was one of a number of sanctioned oil tankers operating near Venezuela that have recently changed their flags to Russia.",

      "The protests began last week with economic grievances as the Iranian currency, the rial, tanked. They quickly turned political, with demonstrators chanting slogans against the ruling clergy.",
      "The rial dropped to a record low of 1.46 million against the dollar Tuesday. If it continues to drop, it is unlikely that the protests will stop anytime soon, analysts say.",
      "HRANA, a network of rights activists, noted in a report Tuesday that 36 people have been killed since the demonstrations began 10 days ago \u2014 34 protesters and two members of the security forces \u2014 and that more than 2,000 people have been arrested.",
      "Dramatic videos posted on social media and verified by NBC News show security forces firing tear gas at Tehran\u2019s main bazaar Tuesday as protesters scramble for cover into passageways and narrow streets. Gunshots can be heard in some videos, and protesters can also be heard chanting slogans directly against the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in the Islamic Republic.",
      "Unrest at the Tehran bazaar is particularly unsettling for officials because the shuttering of shops at the ancient marketplace and protests from the merchant class were key elements that led to the overthrow of the monarchy in 1979.",

      "HAVANA \u2014 The ripple effects from the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on Saturday could make their way quickly here, devastating this island that has been in a yearslong economic crisis.",
      "Following the dramatic operation that ousted Maduro in the dead of night, President Donald Trump suggested Cuba\u2019s government will fall, something reiterated by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.",
      "Since the rise of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela in 1999, Cuba has depended heavily on Venezuela for subsidized oil in exchange for Cuban medical professionals, military advisers, security forces and others. Without Venezuelan oil, Cuba\u2019s economy, which is already in a deep crisis, will likely spiral even further.",
      "\u201cIf oil supply were to cease entirely, the Cuban economy would grind to a halt,\u201d said Pavel Vidal, a former Cuban central bank economist who teaches at Javeriana University in Colombia. \u201cThis would represent a devastating blow to a Cuban economy already in recession for six years and lacking the productive capacity, competitiveness and foreign currency to replace these flows.\u201d",
      "Expecting more hardship",
      "In Cuba, where everyday people are accustomed to the dire economic situation, many are bracing themselves for even tougher conditions following the U.S. actions in Venezuela. The island and its government survived the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s when its economy shrank by roughly 30%.",
      "\u201cThe situation here is going to become very difficult,\u201d said Rey Rodriguez, a butcher. \u201cImagine what awaits us. Less oil, more blackouts \u2026 young people are going to become even more pessimistic.\u201d",
      "There are no oil tankers leaving Venezuela for Cuba based on satellite tracking services, according to Jorge Pi\u00f1\u00f3n, an energy expert at the University of Texas at Austin Energy Institute. It doesn\u2019t mean \u201cghost ships\u201d with their transponders turned off haven\u2019t slipped in.",
      "Venezuela usually sends three or four tankers per month, which adds up to 30,000 to 35,000 barrels per day.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why the Venezuelan supply is so important, because those 30,000 to 35,000 barrels a day represent 50% of the deficit that Cuba has of oil,\u201d Pi\u00f1\u00f3n said. The rest is supplied by Mexico and Russia.",
      "Weeks before the U.S. actions in Venezuela, Cuban President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel gave a bleak outlook of the economy during a speech at the National Assembly, saying the country\u2019s gross domestic product decreased over 4%, inflation shot up and the economy was \u201cpartially paralyzed.\u201d",
      "Content creator Pedro Luis Garc\u00eda said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the economic situation will be, but it will likely worsen because of the oil. But I don\u2019t think there can be a change of government, because the problems have been around since 1962, and this government is prepared for these types of situations.\u201d",
      "Cubans, under U.S. sanctions for decades, have been dealing with severe shortages of food, medicine and fuel for the past few years, as the import-dependent island has seen its foreign currency revenues fall by about 30%.",
      "Its tourism sector, the second most important source of revenue for the government, has taken a hit in recent years and could drop even further if conditions on the island worsen.",
      "Cuba is also grappling with a trifecta of mosquito-borne illnesses including dengue and chikungunya virus that have affected almost one-third of the population. The situation has worsened with the government\u2019s inability to clear piles of trash that accumulate on streets and to carry out fumigation campaigns.",
      "For the past year, Cubans have faced prolonged blackouts because of the island\u2019s aging oil-fired power plants. Cuba\u2019s grid collapsed several times last year because of the outdated infrastructure and fuel shortages. Declining oil imports from Venezuela, Russia and Mexico have led to the rationing of electricity. The capital, Havana, once insulated from blackouts, now faces 10 hours or more without electricity each day. In other parts of the country, the blackouts can extend to 20 hours.",
      "Oil shipments from Venezuela are likely to stop if Trump gets his way.",
      "Cuba\u2019s second biggest supplier of oil, Mexico, is also facing pressure from Trump. He recently suggested the U.S. can take action against the country, saying drugs were \u201cpouring\u201d through Mexico and that \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to do something.\u201d",
      "A defiant government response",
      "The day Maduro was captured, Cuba\u2019s president condemned and denounced the U.S. actions in a defiant speech. D\u00edaz-Canel said that U.S. actions were not about Maduro, his government or even drug trafficking, but that the \u201cobscure object of imperialist desire was Venezuelan petroleum, the lands and natural resources of Venezuela.\u201d",
      "D\u00edaz-Canel also said that \u201cfor Venezuela, and of course also for Cuba, we are willing to give our own blood, even our own lives, at a very high price.\u201d",
      "Cuba\u2019s government said 32 of its military and security personnel were killed Saturday.",
      "Cuba\u2019s state-run media, including television and the official newspaper Granma, published pictures of the 32 officers killed, along with their names, ages and ranks.",
      "In an interview with \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, declined to say what kind of further actions the U.S. could take against Cuba.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to talk to you about what our future steps are going to be and our policies are going to be right now in this regard,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any mystery that we are not big fans of the Cuban regime.\u201d",
      "Cuba is already under heavy U.S. sanctions, but there are still other actions the U.S. can take. During Trump\u2019s first administration, the U.S. banned all flights to Cuba except for Havana.",
      "In Havana, former senior Cuban diplomat Carlos Alzugaray told NBC News, \u201cWe need to see what repercussions this will have. But the world hasn\u2019t ended as it seemed, and as Marco Rubio and Donald Trump would like to portray it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI believe they are using intimidation to see if they can affect relations between Venezuela and Cuba, which I would say are not currently affected because Cuba and most Cubans support Venezuela in condemning the U.S. aggression,\u201d he said.",
      "Alzugaray added that Cuba\u2019s government should be in the midst of intense conversations and consultations with its allies, like China and Russia.",

      "Vidal, the economist, said that when the USSR collapsed, it took the Cuban economy four years to hit rock bottom and begin to recover. Tourism, remittances and foreign investment helped rescue the economy from collapse in those years, something that hasn\u2019t happened this time around.",
      "\u201cToday, there is widespread distrust among the Cuban government\u2019s own international allies regarding the viability of its economic model and its finances,\u201d Vidal said. \u201cIn the 1990s, there was a stronger and more respected political leadership, both nationally and internationally, which is not the case now.\u201d",
      "Orlando Matos reported from Havana and Carmen Sesin from Miami."
