      "It's the second best global debut of the year.",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d opened with $345 million in worldwide sales, according to studio estimates Sunday, notching the second-best global debut of the year and potentially putting James Cameron on course to set yet more blockbuster records.",
      "Sixteen years into the \u201cAvatar\u201d saga, Pandora is still abundant in box-office riches. \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d the third film in Cameron\u2019s science-fiction franchise, launched with $88 million domestically and $257 million internationally. The only film to open bigger in 2025 was \u201cZootopia 2\u201d ($497.2 million over three days). In the coming weeks, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d will have the significant benefit of the highly lucrative holiday moviegoing corridor.",
      "But there was a tad less fanfare to this \u201cAvatar\u201d film, coming three years after \u201cAvatar: The Way of Water.\u201d That film launched in 2022 with a massive $435 million globally and $134 million in North America. Domestically, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d fell a hefty 35% from the previous installment. Reviews for \u201cFire and Ash\u201d were also more mixed, scoring a series-low 68% \u201cfresh\u201d score on Rotten Tomatoes.",
      "Yet those quibbles are only a product of the lofty standards of \u201cAvatar.\u201d The first two films rank as two of the three biggest box-office films of all time. To reach those heights, the \u201cAvatar\u201d films have depended on legs more than huge openings.",
      "\u201cAvatar\u201d (2009), opened with $77 million domestically but held the top spot for seven weeks. It ultimately grossed $2.92 billion worldwide. \u201cThe Way of Water\u201d also held strong to eventually tally $2.3 billion globally.",
      "\u201cThe openings are not what the \u2018Avatar\u2019 movies are about,\u201d said David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter on box office numbers. \u201cIt\u2019s what they do after they open that made them the no. 2 and no. 3 biggest films of all time.\u201d",
      "For \u201cFire and Ash\u201d to follow in those footsteps, it will need robust ticket sales to continue for weeks. Working in its favor so far: strong word-of-mouth. Audiences gave it an \u201cA\u201d CinemaScore.",
      "In interviews, Cameron has repeatedly said \u201cFire and Ash\u201d needs to perform well for there to be subsequent \u201cAvatar\u201d films. (Four and five are already written but not greenlit.) These are exceptionally expensive movies to make. With a production budget of at least $400 million, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d is one of the costliest movies ever made.",
      "\u201cJames Cameron is not known for his low budget movies,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cYou can\u2019t exactly create the world of Pandora on the cheap. If you\u2019re going to have a 3D movie, an epic film that\u2019s three hours and 17 minutes, it\u2019s a huge buy-in of money, time, resources, and then you have to hope the audience wants to once again go along on that ride.\u201d",
      "\u201cFire and Ash\u201d was especially boosted by premium format showings, which accounted for 66% of its opening weekend. A narrow majority of moviegoers (56%) chose to watch it in 3D.",
      "The \u201cAvatar\u201d films have always been especially popular overseas. \u201cFire and Ash\u201d was strongest in China, where its $57.6 million opening weekend surpassed the two previous movies.",
      "\u201cFire and Ash\u201d didn\u2019t have the weekend entirely to itself. A trio of other new wide releases made it into theaters in hopes of offering some counterprogramming: Lionsgate\u2019s \u201cThe Housemaid,\u201d Angel Studios\u2019 \u201cDavid\u201d and Paramount Pictures\u2019 \u201cThe SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants.\u201d",
      "In the race for second place, \u201cDavid\u201d came out on top. The animated tale of David and Goliath collected $22 million from 3,118 theaters, notching the best opening weekend for Angel Studios, the Christian-oriented studio that emerged with 2023\u2019s surprise hit \u201cSound of Freedom.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Housemaid,\u201d Paul Feig\u2019s twisty psychological thriller starring Sydney Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried, opened with $19 million 3,015 theaters. The Lionsgate release, which cost about $35 million to make, is set up well to be one of the top R-rated options in theaters over the holidays. Based on Freida McFadden\u2019s bestselling novel, it stars Sweeney as a woman with a troubled past who becomes a live-in maid for a wealthy family.",
      "Trailing the pack was \u201cThe SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants,\u201d which collected $16 million from 3,557 theaters. The G-rated film, based on the Nickelodeon TV series, is the first \u201cSpongeBob\u201d theatrical movie since 2015\u2019s \u201cThe SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water.\u201d",
      "All of this weekend\u2019s new films will hope the ticket sales keep rolling in over the upcoming Christmas break. Starting Dec. 25, they\u2019ll need to contend with some new wide releases, including A24\u2019s \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d with Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet; Focus Features\u2019 \u201cSong Sung Blue,\u201d with Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson; and Sony\u2019s \u201cAnaconda,\u201d with Jack Black and Paul Rudd.",

      "The Grammys' country album category has been split into two for the 2026 award show",
      "NEW YORK -- Flashback to February. It's the 2025 Grammys, and Beyonc\u00e9 has made history. Not only was she finally awarded the top prize of album of the year, but she also became the first Black woman to win best country album, for \u201cCowboy Carter.\u201d Recent changes by the Recording Academy have made it even more monumental: She might be the last person to ever win the award.",
      "In June, the Academy announced that the Grammys' country album title was splitting into two categories. A new award was created, traditional country album. The preexisting country album category has been redefined and is now contemporary country album, reflecting the genre's ongoing sonic evolutions.",
      "The decision was divisive: Some viewed it as backlash to Beyonc\u00e9's win. Others welcomed the addition of a new award and the creative doors it might open. Some questioned how the categories would be defined in a genre where the word \u201ctraditional\u201d is loaded.",
      "Here's everything you need to know about the change \u2014 and what it could signify in the future.",
      "Charles L. Hughes, Rhodes College professor and author of \u201cCountry Soul,\u201d says Beyonc\u00e9's victory was a welcomed surprise, despite being obviously worthy. That's because her album inspired a larger conversation about reclamation, standing in opposition to the music industry's rigid power structures and \u201cindicated how significant this historical question remains of whether or not Black folks have equal access to success in a genre of music that bears such strong Black influences and has from the very beginning,\u201d Hughes said.",
      "He believes the decision to alter the country album categories was not in direct response to her win \u2014 \u201cI think it is a more complicated story,\u201d he says \u2014 but the timing might've been less than ideal, emboldening fans to view it as reactionary. He hopes the changes will open the category to more diversity of sounds and \u201cwhether this leads to a broader opening and opportunity for Black artists, especially Black women in country music,\u201d he posits.",
      "Francesca T. Royster, a DePaul University professor and author of \u201cBlack Country Music: Listening for Revolutions,\u201d views Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s victory as positively connected to this change. She wonders if artists \u2014 particularly artists of color, who never had their music recognized in country music categories, think of artists like \u201cMillie Jackson or Candi Staton, Bobby Womack\u201d \u2014 would now see their work recognized. \u201cHaving these two categories just allows for more experimentation and maybe less of a double standard,\u201d she says, \u201cin terms of artists who are often held to higher standards to conform to, or be recognizable as, meeting an idea about what country music is.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt makes sense that the Grammy categories for country would become a little bit more expansive,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause I think the music is more expansive and the audience is also more expansive than it\u2019s ever been.\u201d",
      "According to the Recording Academy's rule book, the traditional country category is defined by \u201ccountry recordings that adhere to the more traditional sound structures of the country genre, including rhythm and singing style, lyrical content, as well as traditional country instrumentation.\u201d",
      "Those are: acoustic guitar, steel guitar, fiddle, banjo, mandolin, piano, electric guitar and live drums. This is also where subgenres like outlaw country, Western and Western swing would fit.",
      "The contemporary country category description is a bit more conceptual. The rule book states that albums eligible in this category \u201cutilize a stylistic intention, song structure, lyrical content, and/or musical presentation to create a sensibility that reflects the broad spectrum of contemporary country style and culture.\u201d",
      "The hope is that those titles are \u201crelevant to the legacy of country music\u2019s culture, while also engaging in more contemporary music forms.\u201d",
      "The questions Hughes poses: \u201cWhose tradition are we talking about?\u201d And how is \u201ccountry music's culture\u201d defined?",
      "\u201cIt's almost tautology. \u2018Well, it\u2019s traditional country if it sounds like traditional country,'\u201d he says.",
      "In that reading, contemporary country could simply account for everything else.",
      "Royster says both categories seem to \u201cspeak to an aesthetic as well as political agenda, many agendas.\u201d To her, the traditional category would appeal to artists who believe that \u201cthis is a past form that needs to ... continue to be recognized and respected.\u201d Similarly, the contemporary category is \u201clinked to the culture of country but is also expansive.\u201d",

      "\u201cIn both cases, there\u2019s a kind of story behind the story.\u201d",
      "Adding a new genre category is not unique to country music. Consider a sister genre, R&B. In 1999, the Recording Academy also introduced a traditional category to the R&B field to spotlight artists who chose to hybridize the genre as well as those who prefer nostalgic structures.",
      "It didn't stay stagnant from there: In 2021, the Academy changed the best urban contemporary album category to best progressive R&B album, to spotlight those records that weave R&B with other genres.",
      "In the contemporary country album category, Kelsea Ballerini's \u201cPatterns\u201d faces off against Tyler Childers' \u201cSnipe Hunter,\u201d Eric Church's \u201cEvangeline vs. the Machine,\u201d Jelly Roll's \u201cBeautifully Broken,\u201d and Miranda Lambert's \u201cPostcards from Texas.\u201d",
      "In the traditional category, it is Charley Crockett's \u201cDollar a Day,\u201d Lukas Nelson's \u201cAmerican Romance,\u201d Willie Nelson's \u201cOh What a Beautiful World,\u201d Margo Price's \u201cHard Headed Woman,\u201d and Zach Top's \u201cAin\u2019t In It For My Health.\u201d",
      "Royster wonders if with this first year of nominees, \u201cthere's less risk in terms of recognizing the kind of \u2018country-ness\u2019 of these artists.\u201d Royster views the lineup as \u201cartists (whose) country creds would still be recognized even if they\u2019re also bringing in other elements. I would hope in the future there might be more room in the category.\u201d",
      "For Hughes, the nominees further confuse the distinctions. Consider this example: Zach Top's album borrows heavily from George Strait's sound, which emerged in the \u201870s as a mesh of honky-tonk traditions and contemporary country. Hip-hop also emerged in the \u201970s. They were simultaneous. \u201cBut I have a feeling we won\u2019t be seeing a lot of hip-hop-inspired artists in the traditional category,\u201d he says.",
      "But that doesn't mean it might not evolve in the future. \u201cIf the Grammys fundamentally exist to give people recognition,\u201d he says, \u201cThe more, the merrier.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnytime the pipe widens, more water gets through. And this was the pipe widening, baby,\u201d Jelly Roll, who is nominated in the inaugural best contemporary country album category, told The Associated Press. \u201cI love it. I'm happy. I\u2019m a fan of both sides. It encourages me to maybe make a traditional country album one day, you know? So, this is cool.\u201d",
      "Three-time Grammy award winner Brad Paisley has a similar stance: There's a benefit to having more country music recognitions.",
      "\u201cAwards are really tools to sort of get awareness for something that you made, you know?\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re never the goal. It\u2019s always more like, \u2018Oh, cool, this might make more people listen to it.\u2019 \u2026 If this means they got to make more little gold gramophone statues to give out, and two people get them versus one, great.\u201d",
      "That said: Paisley's not sure which category he would fall into, or if the division could color an artist's creative decisions. \u201cI\u2019d almost have to think it through like, \u2018No, no, we\u2019re going for the Grammy on this. I better not do this on this record or something.\u2019 But hopefully that doesn\u2019t ever enter into it,\u201d he says.",
      "Hopefully, it's just a panel decided who belongs in which category, \u201cand then two people get to go home happy versus one. And that\u2019s good in my book,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cEverybody wants to rule the world,\u201d goes the Tears for Fears song we hear at a key point in \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d Josh Safdie\u2019s nerve-busting adrenaline jolt of a movie starring a never-better Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet.",
      "But here\u2019s the thing: everybody may want to rule the world, but not everybody truly believes they CAN. This, one could argue, is what separates the true strivers from the rest of us.",
      "And Marty \u2014 played by Chalamet in a delicious synergy of actor, role and whatever fairy dust makes a performance feel both preordained and magically fresh \u2014 is a striver. With every fiber of his restless, wiry body. They should add him to the dictionary definition.",
      "Needless to say, Marty is a New Yorker.",
      "Also needless to say, Chalamet is a New Yorker.",
      "And so is Safdie, a writer-director Chalamet has called \u201cthe street poet of New York.\u201d So, where else could this story be set?",
      "It\u2019s 1952, on Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side. Marty Mauser is a salesman in his uncle\u2019s shoe store, escaping to the storeroom for a hot tryst with his (married) girlfriend. Suddenly we\u2019re seeing footage of sperm traveling \u2014 talk about strivers! \u2014 up to an egg. Which morphs, of course, into a pingpong ball.",
      "This witty opening sequence won\u2019t be the only thing recalling \u201cUncut Gems,\u201d co-directed by Safdie with his brother Benny before the two split for solo projects. That film, which feels much like the precursor to \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d began as a trip through the shiny innards of a rare opal, only to wind up inside Adam Sandler\u2019s colon, mid-colonoscopy.",
      "Sandler\u2019s Howard Ratner was a New York striver, too, but sadder, and more troubled. Marty is young, determined, brash \u2014 with an eye always to the future. He\u2019s a great salesman: \u201cI could sell shoes to an amputee,\u201d he boasts, crassly. But what he\u2019s plotting to unveil to the world has nothing to do with shoes. It\u2019s about table tennis.",
      "How likely is it that this Jewish kid from the Lower East Side can become the very face of a sport in America, soon to be \u201cstaring at you from the cover of a Wheaties box?\u201d",
      "To Marty, perfectly likely. Still, he knows nobody in the U.S. cares about table tennis. He\u2019s so determined to prove everyone wrong, starting at the British Open in London, that when there\u2019s a snag obtaining cash for his trip, he brandishes a gun at a colleague to get it.",
      "Shaking off that sorta-armed robbery thing, Marty arrives in London, where he fast-talks his way into a suite at the Ritz. Here, he spies fellow guest Kay Stone (Gwyneth Paltrow, in a wise, stylish return to the screen), a former movie star married to an insufferable tycoon (\u201cShark Tank\u201d personality Kevin O\u2019Leary, one of many nonactors here.)",
      "Kay\u2019s skeptical, but Marty finds a way to woo her. Really, all he has to say is: \u201cCome watch me.\u201d Once she sees him play, she\u2019s sneaking into his room in a lace corselet.",

      "This would be a good time to stop and consider Chalamet\u2019s subtly transformed appearance. He is stick-thin \u2014 duh, he never stops moving. His mustache is skimpy. His skin is acne-scarred \u2014 just enough to erase any movie-star sheen. Most strikingly, his eyes, behind the round spectacles, are beady \u2014 and smaller. Definitely not those movie-star eyes.",
      "But then, nearly all the faces in \u201cMarty Supreme\u201d are extraordinary. In a movie with more than 100 characters, we have known actors (Fran Drescher, Abel Ferrara); nonacting personalities (O\u2019Leary, and an excellent Tyler Okonma (Tyler, The Creator) as Marty\u2019s friend Wally); and exciting newcomers like Odessa A\u2019Zion as Marty\u2019s feisty girlfriend Rachel.",
      "There are also a slew of nonactors in small parts, plus cameos from the likes of David Mamet and even high wire artist Philippe Petit. The dizzying array makes one curious how it all came together \u2014 is casting director Jennifer Venditti taking interns? Production notes tell us that for one hustling scene at a bowling alley, young men were recruited from a sports trading-card convention.",
      "Elsewhere on the creative team, composer Daniel Lopatin succeeds in channelling both Marty\u2019s beating heart and the ricochet of pingpong balls in his propulsive score. The script by Safdie and cowriter Ronald Bronstein, loosely based on real-life table tennis hustler Marty Reisman, beats with its own, never-stopping pulse. The same breakneck aesthetic applies to camera work by Darius Khondji.",
      "Back now to London, where Marty makes the finals against Japanese player Koto Endo (Koto Kawaguchi, like his character a deaf table tennis champion). \u201cI\u2019ll be dropping a third atom bomb on them,\u201d he brags \u2014 not his only questionable World War II quip. But Endo, with his unorthodox paddle and grip, prevails.",
      "After a stint as a side act with the Harlem Globetrotters, including pingpong games with a seal \u2014 you\u2019ll have to take our word for this, folks, we\u2019re running low on space \u2014 Marty returns home, determined to make the imminent world championships in Tokyo.",
      "But he's in trouble \u2014 remember he took cash at gunpoint? Worse, he has no money.",
      "So Marty\u2019s on the run. And he\u2019ll do anything, however messy or dangerous, to get to Japan. Even if he has to totally debase himself (mark our words), or endanger friends \u2014 or abandon loyal and brave Rachel.",
      "Is there something else for Marty, besides his obsessive goal? If so, he doesn\u2019t know it yet. But the lyrics of another song used in the film are instructive here: \u201cEverybody\u2019s got to learn sometime.\u201d",
      "So can a single-minded striver ultimately learn something new about his own life?",
      "We'll have to see. As Marty might say: \u201cCome watch me.\u201d",
      "\u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d an A24 release, has been rated R by the Motion Picture Association \u201cfor language throughout, sexual content, some violent content/bloody images and nudity.\u201d Running time: 149 minutes. Four stars out of four.",

      "SAO PAULO -- SAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 \u201cThe Secret Agent,\u201d a Brazilian feature shortlisted for the Oscars, is all about ordinary people. It follows an unassuming scientist and widowed father who becomes a target of Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship in the 1970s \u2014 not because he is an activist or revolutionary, but because he stands up to a business owner with ties to the regime.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s in danger simply for being who he is, for holding the values he holds,\u201d star Wagner Moura told The Associated Press in a recent interview. \u201cThat\u2019s how authoritarianism works everywhere.\u201d",
      "Directed by Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho, \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d has been hailed by critics as one of the year\u2019s best films and arrives amid a renewed international interest in Brazilian cinema. Expanding in U.S. theaters Friday, the film is backed by major wins at the Cannes Film Festival for both Mendon\u00e7a Filho (best director) and Moura (best actor).",
      "Earlier this month, the 2 1/2-hour thriller earned Golden Globe nominations for best drama, best non-English film and best actor in a drama.",
      "\u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d arrives at a strong moment for Brazilian cinema following the success of \u201cI\u2019m Still Here,\u201d which won this year\u2019s Oscar for best international feature and a Golden Globe for lead actor Fernanda Torres.",
      "In Brazil, expectations for \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d are high. Moura said the widespread enthusiasm around the film \u2014 and the public's engagement with Brazilian artists \u2014 has made him \u201cincredibly happy.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo country develops without culture, without identity,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re watching a Brazilian film, seeing a part of Brazil and its history. That matters.\u201d",
      "Set in 1977, at the height of Brazil\u2019s dictatorship, \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d opens with a black-and-white montage of the era\u2019s national symbols, from movie classics to hit soap operas.",
      "Mendon\u00e7a Filho anchors the story in a precise time and place: Carnival in Recife, the filmmaker's hometown in northeastern Brazil. As the center of his cinematic universe, the city is the set for confronting a country that still struggles to reckon with its past.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve all consumed incredible things from so many places \u2014 from Akira Kurosawa in Japan to Elvis Presley in the American South,\u201d Mendon\u00e7a Filho said. \u201cI am Brazilian, and my film is Brazilian. If it\u2019s good, it will be universal.\u201d",
      "Living undercover and under the alias Marcelo, Armando spends his days scouring archives for clues about his mother\u2019s past and planning to flee the country with his young son. As his quiet quest unfolds, the streets outside explode with Carnival revelry \u2014 a festival so embedded in Brazilian life that even the police chief appears rumpled from the celebrations, confetti still clinging to his hair.",
      "Mendon\u00e7a Filho blends political suspense with urban legends from the period, touching on themes that extend beyond the dictatorship itself, including corruption, state violence and institutional complicity.",
      "One pivotal sequence unfolds inside a movie theater, a nod to the director\u2019s lifelong cinephilia. As fictional audiences spill out of screenings of \u201cJaws\u201d and \u201cThe Omen,\u201d shaken by fictional threats, the country itself is living under real terror.",
      "Over the past decade, Brazilian cinema has increasingly revisited the military dictatorship, which ruled from 1964 to 1985. Alongside \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m Still Here,\u201d filmmakers have returned to the period in works such as \u201cMarighella,\u201d directed by Moura, about the legendary guerrilla leader who took up arms against the regime.",
      "Many of these films were made or released in the past decade, amid the rise of Brazil\u2019s far right. Its most prominent figure was former President Jair Bolsonaro, a retired army captain who praised officers accused of torture and minimized state crimes committed during the dictatorship.",
      "Mendon\u00e7a Filho is among the filmmakers who have taken on the task of confronting national memory.",
      "\u201cThe military is a trauma that was never truly examined,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just say, \u2018Move on, forget it.\u2019 A crust forms over it. The same thing happens to an entire nation.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "\u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash,\u201d will probably be a rewarding experience for fans of James Cameron's saga",
      "When I came down with a cold the day after I saw the third and latest \u201cAvatar\u201d film, \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d I half-wondered if I had picked it up on Pandora.",
      "The promise of Cameron\u2019s 3D trilogy has always been immersion: immersion in a science-fiction world, in technological wonder, in a maybe future of movies. \u201cAvatar\u201d is almost more a place to go than a movie to see.",
      "Still, it\u2019s now been two decades since Cameron set off on this blue-tinted quest. The sheen of newness is off, or at least less pronounced, with new technological advances to contend with. \u201cFire and Ash\u201d is running with a behind-the-scenes video about how performance capture was used during the film\u2019s making. The implicit message is: No, this isn\u2019t AI.",
      "The \u201cAvatar\u201d films, with their visual-effects wizardry and clunky revisionist Western storytelling, have always felt, most of all, like an immersion in a dream of James Cameron\u2019s. The idea of these movies, after all, first came to Cameron, he has said, in a bioluminescent vision decades ago. At their best, the \u201cAvatar\u201d movies have felt like an otherworldly stage for Cameron to juggle so many of the things \u2014 hulking weaponry, ecological wonder, foolhardy human arrogance \u2014 that have marked his movies.",
      "\u201cFire and Ash,\u201d at well more than three hours, is our longest stay yet on Pandora and the one most likely to make you ponder why you came here, in the first place. These remain epics of craft and conviction. You can feel Cameron\u2019s deep devotion to the dynamics of his central characters, even when his interest outstrips our own.",
      "That\u2019s especially true in \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d which, following the deep-sea, family-focused part two, \u201cThe Way of Water,\u201d pivots to a new chapter of culture clash. It introduces a violent rival Na\u2019vi clan whose rageful leader, Varang (Oona Chaplin), partners with Stephen Lang\u2019s booming Col. Miles Quaritch and the human colonizers.",
      "For those who have closely followed the \u201cAvatar\u201d saga, I suspect \u201cFire and Ash\u201d will be a rewarding experience. Quaritch, Pandora\u2019s answer to Robert Duvall\u2019s Bill Kilgore in \u201cApocalypse Now,\u201d remains a ferociously captivating character. And the introduction of Chaplin\u2019s Varang gives this installment an electricity that the previous two were missing.",
      "But for those whose trips to Pandora have made less of an impact, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d is a bit like returning to a half-remembered vacation spot, only one where the local ponytail style is a little strange and everyone seems to have the waist of a supermodel.",
      "Time has only reinforced the sense that these films are hermetically sealed movie terrariums. They're like a $1 billion beta test that, for all their box-office success, have ultimately proven that all the design capabilities in the world can\u2019t conjure a story of meaningful impact. The often-remarked light cultural footprint left by the first two blockbusters only hints at why these movie seem to evaporate by the ending credits. It\u2019s the lack of inner life to any of the characters and the bland, screen-saver aesthetics. At this point in a trilogy, nine hours in, that hollowness makes \u201cFire and Ash\u201d feel like almost theoretical drama: more avatar than genuine article.",
      "These movies have had to work extremely hard, moment to moment, just to pass as believable. But almost every gesture, every movement and every bit of dialogue has had something unnatural about it. (The high frame rate is partially to blame.) That\u2019s made these uncanny movies a combination, in equal measure, of things you\u2019ve never seen before, and things you can\u2019t unsee.",
      "\u201cFire and Ash,\u201d scripted by Cameron, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, picks up with the aftermath of the climatic battle of \u201cThe Way of Water.\u201d The Na\u2019vi and their seafaring allies, the Metkayina clan, are nursing their wounds and recovering the human weapons that sunk to the sea floor.",

      "When a rival clan called the Mangkwan or Ash People come to challenge the Na\u2019vi, those weapons represent an ethical quandary. Should they use such firepower in their own local battles? This is a more difficult question partially because the fire-mad Mangkwan are especially bloodthirsty, led by their slinky sorceress, Vanang (played with seductive sadism by Chaplin, granddaughter of Charlie).",
      "But their fight is only a piece of the larger war of \u201cFire and Ash.\u201d The focus of this third chapter (films four and five are said to be written but not greenlit) is interspecies coexistence. As human and Na\u2019vi lines continue to blur, the question becomes whether the human invaders will transform Pandora or if Pandora will transform them.",
      "That puts the focus on the three characters in various in-between states. First, there\u2019s Spider (Jack Champion), the human son of Quaritch who lives happily with the Na\u2019vi while breathing through a machine to survive the Pandora atmosphere. (Champion has the double misfortune of wearing a mask and looking downright puny next to the tall and slender natives.) But in \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d he discovers he can breathe unfiltered, a development that prompts intense military interest in a potentially hugely profitable breakthrough in Pandora assimilation.",
      "There\u2019s also Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), the former human who has made a Na\u2019vi family with Neytiri (Zoe Salda\u00f1a). For Neytiri, the growing menace of human warfare causes her to doubt her bond with Jake. The prejudices of \u201cFire and Ash\u201d seep even into the home.",
      "Most interesting of the three, though, remains Quaritch. He may be violently trying to subjugate Pandora but he also obviously delights in his Na\u2019vi body and in his life on this distant moon. You can see him flinch when his commander, General Ardmore (Edie Falco), refers to their Mangkwan allies as \u201csavages.\u201d Meanwhile, Quaritch and Vanang hit it off like gangbusters.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got new eyes, colonel,\u201d one character tells Quaritch. \u201cAll you\u2019ve got to do is open them.\u201d",
      "The \u201cAvatar\u201d films have done plenty to open eyes over the past 16 years. To new cinematic horizons, to the boundlessness of Cameron's visions, to the Papyrus font. But the most endearing quality of \u201cAvatar\u201d is that Cameron believes so ardently in it. I might be caught up less in the goings on Pandora, but I'm kind of glad that he is. There are worse things than dreaming up a better world, with still a fighting chance.",
      "\u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash,\u201d a 20th Century Studios release, opens in theaters Dec. 19. It's rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for intense sequences of violence and action, bloody images, some strong language, thematic elements and suggestive material. Running time: 195 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",

      "\u201cHollywood has taken a lot of criticism by those in the faith community for not providing films that speak to them, that reflect their values,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore\u2019s senior media analyst, emphasizing the box-office potential of faith-based films.",
      "Studios are realizing faith-based film and television is a worthwhile investment at least in part due to the success of \u201cThe Chosen,\u201d which Angel helped launch in 2017, even if it initially took time to see those results.",
      "\u201cIt was like pulling teeth to get people to watch it,\u201d recalled Angel CEO and co-founder Neal Harmon. \u201cPeople have this idea that faith means cheesy or preachy. And we had to break through that barrier.\u201d",
      "Once they did, it paid off. Since Fathom Entertainment began distributing \u201cThe Chosen\u201d theatrically in 2023, the series has grossed more than $116 million domestically.",
      "Though not a Christian company, Angel aims to distribute and market \u201cvalues-based entertainment\u201d that includes but is not limited to stories of faith. They\u2019ve released a host of religious films, with \u201cZero A.D.,\u201d a biblical epic about the Massacre of the Innocents recounted in the Gospel of Matthew, on the docket for 2026.",
      "Meanwhile, Lionsgate is set to premiere \u201cI Can Only Imagine 2\u201d in theaters February, a sequel to the 2018 biopic starring Dennis Quaid, which was one of the highest-grossing Christian films of all-time in the United States.",
      "Co-director Andrew Erwin said he noticed a \u201cmassive shift\u201d take place about five years ago, after years of disconnect between the demand for these kinds of films and Hollywood\u2019s willingness to make them.",
      "\u201cFor the first time, movie studios are really giving us a fair shake,\u201d he said, though he thinks the quality of the content was also a factor. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the knowledge of how to do the filmmaking side of things. And so, I think the storytelling has gotten a lot better.\u201d",
      "Lionsgate is also set to distribute the first of Gibson\u2019s two-part sequel to \u201cThe Passion of the Christ\u201d in 2027.",
      "Trying to define what counts as faith-based programming is a bit like trying to define what counts as pornography.",

      "Tennessee Williams' early radio play, \u201cThe Strangers,\u201d is featured in The Strand this week",
      "NEW YORK -- Long before the rise of podcast dramas, listeners worldwide tuned in to the audio-only narratives of radio plays.",
      "Tom Stoppard and Arthur Miller were among the many playwrights who early in their careers completed brief pieces for radio, while such memorable dramas as Harold Pinter's \u201cA Slight Ache\u201d and Robert Bolt's \u201cA Man for All Seasons\u201d premiered as radio broadcasts. Radio work was often a way to bring in money and to refine the arts of plotting and dialogue.",
      "When Tennessee Williams was a student at the University of Iowa in the late 1930s, still referring to himself by his birth name, Tom Williams, he completed a rarely-heard gothic sketch for radio called \u201cThe Strangers.\u201d Williams' play appears this week in The Strand Magazine, which has previously published little-known works by Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner and John Steinbeck among others.",
      "\u201cThe play incorporates all the theatrical elements of early radio horror,\u201d writes Strand managing editor Andrew Gulli, \u201ca storm, howling wind, shadows, a house perched over the sea, flickering candles, mysterious footsteps on the stairs, spectral beings \u2014 as well as early hints of the themes and devices Williams would return to in his most famous later works: isolation, fear, the shades of gray between imagination and reality, and a house haunted by memory and the private terrors of those who inhabit it.\u201d",
      "Blanche DuBois would famously invoke \u201cthe kindness of strangers\u201d in Williams' classic \u201cA Streetcar Named Desire.\u201d You could call this early work \u201cThe Horror of Strangers.\u201d His play is set in a columned New England manor on the Atlantic coast, a \u201cghostly\u201d home squinting under a lighthouse beam that casts a yellowish spell. The title refers to invisible demons who haunt two of the home's residents, Mr. Brighton and Mrs. Brighton.",
      "\u201cWe members of the human species are equipped with only five senses. Or six at the very most,\u201d Mr. Brighton declares early on. \u201cThe Strangers are creatures that might be perceptible to us if we had seven or eight or maybe nine senses. But as it is, they exist just outside our little sphere of contact with reality and so \u2026 what we know of them is very, very slight.\u201d",

Bak believes Williams was influenced by commercial considerations and by more personal forces.",
      "Horror stories were popular on radio in the late '30s, Bak says. Williams first thought of radio plays as an \u201cexercise,\u201d but he would eventually take them more seriously. While writing \u201cThe Strangers,\u201d he was already haunted by the mental health struggles of his sister, Rose, who would later inspire the fragile Laura Wingfield of \u201cThe Glass Menagerie.\u201d Williams would long explore the idea of madness, Bak says, and how we respond to people who seem to see things \u201cno one else can see.\u201d",

      "\u201cI didn't know you could sing,\u201d said the special teams coordinator, who heard some buzz about Briggs' vocal talents. \"Man, go ahead and sing something.\"",
      "The spotlight was suddenly on the big defensive tackle. But Briggs is used to shining when it's time to perform \u2014 on and off the football field.",
      "So, remaining seated in a room full of teammates and coaches, the 6-foot-1, 313-pound tenor smoothly belted out Tevin Campbell's 1990s R&B hit, \u201cCan We Talk.\"",
      "\u201cI knew he could sing because he said he could, but then he sang in person \u2014 man, he has a beautiful voice,\u201d defensive tackle Harrison Phillips said.",
      "\u201cIt was crazy, actually,\u201d safety Isaiah Oliver recalled. \u201cI didn't know that about him prior to that meeting, so it was kind of shocking. But it was really good.\u201d",
      "So much so, Briggs received a standing ovation.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of guys were more surprised with, one, the song I sang, and then how it actually sounded,\" a smiling Briggs said. \"They were like, \u2018Oh, that can\u2019t be coming from Juwon!'\"",
      "But an even bigger surprise for some of Briggs' teammates is that he's a one-man band who has learned how to play 12 instruments to varying degrees of competency.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just one of those things,\u201d he said. \u201cLike I always say, everybody\u2019s got something. I just happen to be a musical guy.\u201d",
      "That's putting it lightly.",
      "There's Briggs' exceptional voice, of course. But he also has played the recorder, piano, violin, viola, cello, stand-up bass, bass guitar, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, saxophone, flute and harmonica, and still owns a few of them. Briggs has messed around with drums, too, but doesn\u2019t count that as part of his musical repertoire.",
      "\u201cI've never seen anybody who could play as many instruments and be so gifted vocally,\u201d defensive tackle Jay Tufele said. \u201cHe's a beast on the field and off.\u201d",
      "When it comes to football, Briggs has been one of the Jets' bright spots during a mostly dismal season. He has emerged as a pass-rushing, run-stuffing starter since replacing Quinnen Williams, who was traded last month to Dallas.",
      "The 24-year-old D-lineman wasn't even on the team until a few weeks before the regular season, when the seventh-round pick of Cleveland last year out of the University of Cincinnati was acquired by New York. He has 28 total tackles, six tackles for loss, a forced fumble, three sacks and nine quarterback hits.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a big man, he\u2019s strong,\u201d coach Aaron Glenn said. \"He\u2019s able to stop the run. He\u2019s been doing a good job of that, but what\u2019s been surprising \u2014 and I wouldn\u2019t say surprising \u2014 but what he\u2019s had the tick up in is his ability to rush the passer also. So, we want to be able to utilize that.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not saying that he\u2019s Mean Joe Greene or anything like that, but listen, he\u2019s been doing a really good job of being disruptive in the pass game.\u201d",
      "Briggs grew up in Cincinnati with four older sisters, a younger brother and parents who all loved music and sports, making for a seamless duet of life-long passions.",
      "\u201cWith music, I\u2019d probably say it started from the womb,\u201d Briggs said with a laugh. \u201cI always say I kind of got the trickle-down effect. They\u2019ve all been singing, dancing, acting and playing sports since before I was even thought of, so I kind of just fell into a musical household.\"",
      "There were times one sibling would start playing an instrument, another would join, someone would start singing and then another would harmonize.",
      "\u201cWe had a very loud house,\u201d a smiling Briggs said. \u201cIt was kind of like \u2018Battle of the Bands.\u2019 It was a lot of fun.

      "PARIS -- The ongoing strike at the Louvre is no longer just a labor dispute. It has become a test of how securely, credibly and competently the world\u2019s most visited museum is being run.",
      "Behind the walkout are not only frayed labor relations, but a building itself under strain, with crumbling parts of the aging former palace now deemed unsafe.",
      "At the heart of the crisis lies a deeper rupture: a $102 million jewel heist that exposed security failures at the core of the institution and transformed long-simmering staff grievances into a national reckoning with global resonance.",
      "Tensions were already rising when a wildcat June strike abruptly shut the museum, stranding visitors beneath I.M. Pei\u2019s glass pyramid. Weeks later, the Louvre announced the closure of offices and a public gallery because of weakened floor beams, deepening concern about neglect across the aging complex.",
      "The October daylight robbery, in which thieves stole crown jewels, intensified scrutiny from lawmakers and auditors and reframing workplace complaints as questions of institutional failure.",
      "Culture Ministry officials have tried to defuse the standoff by proposing to cancel a planned 2026 funding cut, hire additional guards and visitor services staff, and raise pay. Unions rejected the measures as inadequate, signaling that trust has frayed beyond quick fixes.",
      "On Monday, the CFDT union said that 400 workers at a meeting voted to strike over chronic understaffing, deteriorating buildings and management decisions. Workers on Wednesday voted to extend the action, forcing the Louvre to operate on a restricted footing.",
      "The museum partially reopened a limited \u201cmasterpiece route,\u201d granting access to the \u201cMona Lisa,\u201d the Venus de Milo and a handful of galleries \u2014 a stopgap that allowed visitors inside while highlighting how far normal operations have slipped.",
      "Pressure has now shifted squarely onto Louvre President Laurence des Cars. The ministry has announced emergency anti-intrusion measures and appointed Philippe Jost, who oversaw the restoration of Notre Dame Cathedral, to help reorganize the museum. It's a step widely read as a sign that confidence in existing governance has been shaken.",
      "French senators were told last week that thieves who stole crown jewels valued at more than $100 million escaped the Louvre with barely 30 seconds to spare, a detail that crystallized the scale of the breakdown.",
      "A parliamentary inquiry described the Oct. 19 theft as one of the result of cascading failures. Only one of two cameras covering the break-in point was functioning, and security staff lacked enough screens to monitor footage in real time.",

      "For staff now on strike, the Senate findings confirmed what they say they had warned for years: that the museum\u2019s defenses were thin, its warnings unheeded, and its margin for error measured in seconds.",
      "The heist has sharpened attention on the Louvre\u2019s condition. Parts of the vast complex have been closed after officials discovered structural weaknesses, including nine rooms in the Campana Gallery devoted to ancient Greek ceramics.

Critics say it has moved too slowly and focused too heavily on headline projects. A court audit flagged considerable delays in deploying modern security equipment and found that only a fraction of allocated funds had been spent on safety.",
      "A proposal to give Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s \u201cMona Lisa\u201d a dedicated room with its own entrance was intended to ease crushing crowds. Instead, it has become a symbol of what workers see as misplaced priorities.",

      "JEFFERSONVILLE, Ind. -- Inside a storage room at the Clark County Health Department are boxes with taped-on signs reading, \u201cDO NOT USE.\u201d They contain cookers and sterile water that people use to shoot up drugs.",
      "The supplies, which came from the state and were paid for with federal money, were for a program where drug users exchange dirty needles for clean ones, part of a strategy known as harm reduction. But under a July executive order from President Donald Trump, federal substance abuse grants can\u2019t pay for supplies such as cookers and tourniquets that it says \u201conly facilitate illegal drug use.\u201d Needles already couldn\u2019t be purchased with federal money.",
      "In some places, the order is galvanizing support for syringe exchange programs, which decades of research show are extremely effective at preventing disease among intravenous drug users and getting them into treatment.",
      "In others, it\u2019s fueling opposition that threatens the programs' existence.",
      "Republican-led Indiana passed a law allowing exchanges a decade ago after the tiny city of Austin became the epicenter of the worst drug-fueled HIV outbreak in U.S. history. Unless lawmakers extend it, that law is scheduled to sunset next year, and the number of exchanges has been dwindling. State officials told remaining programs to comply with Trump's order \u2014 and even to discard federally funded supplies such as cookers and tourniquets.",
      "For now, Clark County health workers have found a way to keep distributing cookers and other items: buy them with private money and package them in \u201cmystery bags,\u201d assembled by employees who aren\u2019t paid with state or federal funds.",
      "Democratic-led California, meanwhile, has continued using state funds for supplies such as pipes and syringes. California is home to a rising number of exchanges, with 70 of the more than 580 listed by the North American Syringe Exchange Network.",
      "Some public health experts lament that syringe services programs have become subject to growing politicization and dissent.",
      "Clark County Health Officer Dr. Eric Yazel says IV drug users will likely inject themselves with or without clean supplies. Exchanges prevent people from sharing needles and spreading disease, he said, \u201cdecreasing the public health risk for the whole population.\u201d",
      "But Curtis Hill, a Republican former Indiana attorney general, is among critics who raise the same concern Trump\u2019s order does: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to get into a situation where we\u2019re promoting drug use.\u201d",
      "When participants arrive at the Clark County health department, they look down at a list of services and say they are there for \u201cNo. 1.\u201d",
      "They choose from a cart with needles, bandages, sharps containers and the overdose reversal drug naloxone. They can receive testing for HIV and hepatitis C; information on drug treatment; and flyers on food banks, housing, and job placement. There are even handmade knit hats with encouraging notes like, \u201cYou\u2019ve got this!\u201d",
      "\u201cWe spend a half hour, 45 minutes or so talking to them about where they are, if they want treatment, if they\u2019re ready,\u201d Program Director Dorothy Waterhouse said. \u201cThese are our brothers, our sisters, our mothers, our fathers. \u2026 We need compassion to make sure they\u2019re getting into treatment.\u201d",
      "It's the closest exchange to Austin, a 35-minute drive away. Scott County, where Austin is located, already ended its program.",
      "Joshua Gay lived in an apartment across the street when he used the Clark County exchange. He shot up meth daily.",
      "\u201cThe addiction, it took away everything. It took away my life. It took away my job, took away my health.

      "Local and national public health and addiction experts point to research showing exchanges don't increase syringe litter, crime or IV drug use \u2014 and that every dollar invested returns an estimated $7 in avoided health care costs.",

      "\u201cWithout these programs, there will be one less tool to address the diseases of substance use disorder, hepatitis C and HIV,\u201d Witchey said. \u201cAnd that could lead to a very dangerous place for us. We have seen where this leads.\u201d",

      "\"This lawsuit is a stalling tactic and tells me that we have been on the right side of this issue all along,\u201d Hanaway said in the news release.",
      "At issue is a lawsuit Missouri filed alleging that China hoarded personal protective equipment during the early months of the pandemic, harming the state and its residents. A federal judge ruled for Missouri earlier this year after China declined to participate in the trial. It called the lawsuit \u201c very absurd \u201d when it was filed in 2020.",

But an appeals court allowed one part of the lawsuit to proceed: the allegation that China hoarded personal protective equipment, such as respirator masks, medical gowns and gloves.",

      "U.S. health officials have expanded approval of a drug that boosts libido in women who report stress due to a low sex drive",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. health officials have expanded approval of a much-debated drug aimed at boosting female libido, saying the once-a-day pill can now be taken by postmenopausal women up to 65 years old.",
      "The announcement Monday from the Food and Drug Administration broadens the drug's use to older women who have gone through menopause. The pill, Addyi, was first approved 10 years ago for premenopausal women who report emotional stress due to low sex drive.",
      "Addyi, marketed by Sprout Pharmaceuticals, was initially expected to become a blockbuster drug, filling an important niche in women's health. But the drug came with unpleasant side effects including dizziness and nausea, and it carries a safety warning about the dangers of combining it with alcohol.",
      "The boxed warning cautions that drinking while consuming the pill can cause dangerously low blood pressure and fainting. If patients have several drinks, the label recommends waiting a few hours before taking the drug, or skipping one dose.",
      "Sales of Addyi, which acts on brain chemicals that affect mood and appetite, fell short of Wall Street's initial expectations. In 2019, the FDA approved a second drug for low female libido, an on-demand injection that acts on a different set of neurological chemicals.",
      "Sprout CEO Cindy Eckert said in a statement the approval \u201creflects a decade of persistent work with the FDA to fundamentally change how women\u2019s sexual health is understood and prioritized.\u201d The company, based in Raleigh, North Carolina, announced the FDA update in a press release Monday.",
      "The medical condition for a troublingly low sexual appetite, called hypoactive sexual desire disorder, has been recognized since the 1990s and is thought to affect a significant portion of American women, according to surveys. After the blockbuster success of Viagra for men in the 1990s, drugmakers began pouring money into research and potential therapies for sexual dysfunction in women.",
      "But diagnosing the condition is complicated because of how many factors can affect libido, especially after menopause, when falling hormone levels trigger a number of biological changes and medical symptoms. Doctors are supposed to rule out a number of other issues, including relationship problems, medical conditions, depression and other mental disorders, before prescribing medication.",

      "The diagnosis is not universally accepted, and some psychologists argue that low sex drive should not be considered a medical problem.",
      "The FDA rejected Addyi twice prior to its 2015 approval, citing the drug's modest effectiveness and worrisome side effects. The approval came after a lobbying campaign by the company and its supporters, Even the Score, which framed the lack of options for female libido as a women's rights issue.",

      "Severe foreign aid cuts imposed this year by U.S. President Donald Trump, along with funding reductions from other countries, shuttered thousands of schools and youth training centers in camps for Rohingya in Bangladesh and crippled child protection pr...",
      "UKHIYA, Bangladesh -- In moments when she is alone, when there is a break in the beatings from her husband, the girl cries for the school that was once her place of peace in a world that has otherwise offered her none.",
      "Ever since the military in her homeland of Myanmar killed her father in 2017, forcing her to flee to neighboring Bangladesh with her mother and little sisters, the school had protected Hasina from the predators who prowl her refugee camp, home to 1.2 million members of Myanmar\u2019s persecuted Rohingya minority.",
      "It had also protected her from being forced into marriage. And then one day in June, when Hasina was 16 years old, her teacher announced that the school\u2019s funding had been taken away. The school was closing. In a blink, Hasina\u2019s education was over, and so, too, was her childhood.",
      "With her learning opportunities gone, and her family worried that foreign aid cuts would make their fight for survival in the camps even more perilous, Hasina \u2014 along with hundreds of other girls under the age of 18 \u2014 was quickly married off. And, just like Hasina, many of the girls are now trapped in marriages with men who abuse them.",
      "\u201cI dreamed of being something, of working for the community,\u201d Hasina, now 17, says softly. The Associated Press is withholding her full name to protect her from retaliation by her husband. \u201cMy life is destroyed.\u201d",
      "The sudden and severe foreign aid cuts imposed this year by U.S. President Donald Trump, along with funding reductions from other countries, shuttered thousands of the camps\u2019 schools and youth training centers and crippled child protection programs. Beyond unwanted marriages, scores of children as young as 10 were forced into backbreaking manual labor, and girls as young as 12 forced into prostitution. With no safe space to play or learn, children were left to wander the labyrinthine camps, making them increasingly easy targets for kidnappers. And the young and desperate were picked off by traffickers who promised to restore what the children had lost: Hope.",
      "In a sweltering building not far from the cramped shelter where her husband tortures her, Hasina plays nervously with the strap of her pink mobile phone case, emblazoned with the words \u201cForever Young.\u201d",
      "She is still young, she says. But the aid cuts forced her into womanhood and into a nightmare. Not long after marrying her husband, she says, he isolated her from her family and began to beat and sexually abuse her. She daydreams daily of school, where she was a whiz at English and hoped to become a teacher. Now, she is confined largely to her shelter, cooking and cleaning and waiting with dread for the next beating.",
      "If she had any way to escape, she says, she would. But there is nowhere to go. She cannot return to Myanmar, where the military that killed thousands of Rohingya in 2017 during what the U.S. declared a genocide remains in charge of her homeland.",
      "Now, her husband is in charge of her future, though she no longer sees one.",
      "\u201cIf the school hadn\u2019t closed,\u201d she says, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be trapped in this life.\u201d",
      "Life has always been dangerous for the 600,000 children languishing in these chaotic, overcrowded camps, where a squalid jumble of bamboo and tarpaulin shelters are jammed onto landslide-prone hills. But Trump\u2019s decision in January to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development has made it even more so, the AP found in interviews with 37 children, family members, teachers, community leaders and aid workers.",
      "Violations against children in the camps have risen sharply this year, according to UNICEF, the United Nations\u2019 children\u2019s agency. Between January and mid-November, reported cases of abduction and kidnapping more than quadrupled over the same time period last year, to 560 children. And there has been an eightfold increase in reports of armed groups\u2019 recruitment and use of children for training and support roles in the camps, with 817 children affected. Many members of the armed groups are battling a powerful ethnic militia across the border in Myanmar. The actual number of cases is likely higher due to underreporting, according to UNICEF, which lost 27% of its funding due to the U.S. aid cuts and subsequently shuttered nearly 2,800 schools.",
      "\u201cThe armed groups, with their roots in Myanmar, are operating in the camps, using the camps as a fertile ground for recruiting young people,\u201d says Patrick Halton, a child protection manager for UNICEF. \u201cObviously, if children are not in learning centers and not in multipurpose centers, then they\u2019re more vulnerable to this.\u201d",
      "Verified cases of child marriage, which the U.N. defines as the union of children under age 18, rose by 21% and verified child labor cases by 17% in the year to September, compared to the same time period last year. Those statistics are likely to be a significant undercount, says Halton.",
      "\u201cWith the funding cuts, we had to downscale a lot in terms of the education,\u201d Halton says. \u201cIt\u2019s meant that children have not necessarily had things to do, and we\u2019ve therefore seen this rise in children being married, children being in child labor.\u201d",
      "Though the U.S. spent just 1% of its budget on foreign aid, Trump dubbed USAID wasteful and shut it down, a move that has proven catastrophic for the world\u2019s most vulnerable. In Myanmar, the AP found the aid cuts have caused children to starve to death, despite U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s statement to Congress that \u201cNo one has died\u201d because of the dissolution of USAID. A study published in The Lancet journal in June said the U.S. funding cuts could result in more than 14 million deaths, including more than 4.5 million children under age 5, by 2030.",
      "In the Bangladesh camps, the U.S. \u2014 which has long been the biggest provider of aid to the predominantly Muslim Rohingya \u2014 slashed its funding by nearly half compared to last year. The overall Rohingya emergency response is only 50% funded for 2025, and aid agencies say next year is expected to be far worse.",
      "In a statement to the AP, the State Department said the U.S. has provided more than $168 million to the Rohingya since the beginning of Trump\u2019s term, although data from the U.N.\u2019s financial tracking service show the U.S. contribution in 2025 is $156 million. Asked about the disparity, the State Department said the U.N.\u2019s financial tracking service had not been recently updated and \u201cgenerally does not show the latest information on all U.S. funding.\u201d",
      "The department said it had \u201cadvanced burden sharing and improved efficiency\u201d in the Rohingya response, resulting in 11 countries increasing their funding by more than 10% year on year, collectively contributing $72 million.",
      "\u201cThe Trump Administration continues to pursue the diplomatic efforts to encourage additional countries to help shoulder the burden,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The department didn\u2019t respond to the AP\u2019s request for evidence that the U.S. had influenced other countries\u2019 funding decisions for the Rohingya response.",
      "When the schools shut down, hundreds of underage girls \u2014 some as young as 14 \u2014 were married off, says Showkutara, executive director of the Rohingya Women Association for Education and Development. Her network of contacts across the camps have also reported an increase in kidnapping and trafficking, as well as a huge surge in the prostitution of girls as young as 12 since the aid cuts.",
      "\u201cAfter the school closures, they had no space to play. ... That\u2019s why they\u2019re playing on the roads, far away from their blocks,\u201d says Showkutara, who goes by one name. \u201cThere are some groups who are targeting the children.\u201d",
      "While UNICEF managed to repurpose some of its remaining funding, enabling the agency to recently reopen most of its learning centers, scores of schools run by other aid groups are still shut, and thousands of children remain out of class. And aid workers are anticipating even steeper funding cuts next year, leaving the schools\u2019 futures uncertain. Save the Children has only secured a third of its funding target for life-saving services for 2026, meaning 20,000 children attending its schools are at risk of losing their education starting in January, says Golam Mostofa, the group\u2019s area director for Cox\u2019s Bazar, the closest city to the camps.",
      "Meanwhile, Showkutara says, the children locked out of learning by the initial closures are forever lost: Both metaphorically, in the case of girls like Hasina who were married off to men who will never let them return to school even if they reopen, and literally, in the case of children who vanished into the trafficking network.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too late,\u201d she says.",
      "The little boy sits slumped on a plastic stool under the punishing sun, his cheeks streaked with sweat, a cooler of freeze pops and other treats at his dirty feet. Ever since 10-year-old Mohammed Arfan\u2019s school closed, this is where he spends 10 hours a day, seven days a week, selling snacks and daydreaming of the small schoolroom where he once felt safe and loved.",
      "He had just finished his math lessons the day that his teacher told him the school\u2019s funding was gone. As he walked home, he and his friends began to cry.",
      "\u201cI thought that I would not see my friends anymore, and that I was losing my future,\u201d he says.",
      "With no lessons to occupy his time, and his parents worried about their seven children\u2019s survival, Arfan\u2019s mother told him he would need to work to help keep the family fed.",
      "He was terrified. If the camp\u2019s kidnappers or thieves targeted him while he was working, he knew he was too small to fight back.",

      "But he had no choice, and so his daily drudgery began. Each morning, he wakes at 7 and walks for half an hour to the factory to pick up the treats. Then, hoisting the 15-kilogram (30-pound) cooler upon his bony shoulder, he walks another 30 minutes to the corner of the dusty road where he sets up shop among the garbage, rotting banana peels and swarms of flies. For his efforts, he takes home around 200 to 300 taka ($1.60 to $2.50) a day.",
      "There are boys like Arfan all over the camps, selling food they\u2019re desperate to eat and collecting trash in exchange for cash, shoulders slumped with exhaustion, skin seared by the sun.",
      "In a drainage ditch next to a row of stinking latrines, 13-year-old Rahamot Ullah wades up to his waist in water clouded with raw sewage, plucking from the muck discarded pieces of plastic. Five hours of rummaging through the waste will generally net him enough plastic to trade for around 50 taka (40 cents).",
      "His eye blazes with blood from the bamboo that pierced it 10 days earlier while slogging through the sewage. He began coming here soon after his school shut down, in the hopes he could collect enough trash to pay the 500 taka ($4) a month fee for private lessons. Many months, that fee has remained out of reach.",
      "He worries he will drown in the ditch. And he worries that his dreams of becoming a camp official or a teacher will never come true.",
      "Back on the street corner, Arfan, too, feels his dreams dying. He shouldn\u2019t be here, he says, voice barely audible above the incessant shrieking of horns from the rickshaws racing past, just inches from his cooler.",
      "\u201cI feel shame working,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is the time I should be studying.\u201d",
      "Each night when the sun sets, Arfan packs up and heads back to his shelter. And it is here where he lies on a mat on the bamboo floor, crying himself to sleep and pining for the life he was forced to leave behind.",
      "The laughter that once filled Noor Zia\u2019s classroom has been replaced by tears. Nearly every day, she says, her former students stop by to see if the school has reopened, only to break down when told it has not.",
      "Zia often finds herself in tears, too. Before the aid cuts, she was the head teacher of 21 early learning centers that served 630 children aged 3-5. But the closures left her without a job, making it even harder for her to keep her family alive on the camp\u2019s meager rations.",
      "\u201cMy heart is still crying, because my family depends on this job,\u201d she says, sitting in the empty classroom, where the wall behind her is adorned with a drawing of the Myanmar flag \u2014 a country most of her students, born in the camps, have never seen.",
      "The funding cuts\u2019 pain goes beyond the school closures. Skills development programs that kept thousands of children occupied were also halted. Healthcare, nutrition and sanitation services have been reduced. In camps crawling with scabies and other diseases, the results of the reductions are clear on the children\u2019s scrawny bodies. Lesions line their slender limbs. The wet, rattling coughs of babies fill the fetid air. Atop a muddy hill, clusters of kids scratch ferociously at their heads, while a 4-year-old stoically plucks nits from her friend\u2019s scalp.",
      "Bangladesh has barred the Rohingya from leaving the camps to find work, so they are reliant upon humanitarian aid to survive. But the U.N.\u2019s World Food Program, which had counted the U.S. as its largest donor, says it only has enough funds to continue providing food rations through March.",
      "The prospect of a ration cut has terrified families. With no country offering the Rohingya large-scale resettlement, many have opted to make a run for it, with devastating results. Nearly a third of the 1,340 Rohingya who have fled Bangladesh by boat this year have died or gone missing en route, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.",
      "Noor Kaida, a 17-year-old whose dreams of becoming a doctor were dashed when she was married off after her school shut, says she has lost two young relatives to traffickers. Shattered by the school closures, the 13- and 16-year-old girls believed traffickers who promised them a better life in Malaysia, Kaida says. Other passengers on the girls\u2019 boats later told Kaida\u2019s family both girls were killed; one by drowning, and the other at the hands of a trafficker.",
      "\u201cIf the school wasn\u2019t closed, they wouldn\u2019t have had to take these risks,\u201d Kaida says. \u201cBecause of the funding cuts and the school closures, thousands of girls were scattered in different places and their lives have been ruined.\u201d",
      "The 13-year-old boy had been missing for nine days when the call came in from an unfamiliar number.",
      "\u201cBaba, I\u2019m leaving,\u201d Mohammed told his frantic father. \u201cI\u2019m on the big boat now. Pray for me.\u201d",
      "The call disconnected, and Mohib Ullah knew his worst nightmare had come true: Just like so many other children in recent months, his boy had been taken by traffickers. Ullah \u2014 who has no relation to Rahamot Ullah \u2014 called back again and again, but the phone was switched off.",
      "Mohammed \u2014 whose full name the AP is withholding for safety reasons \u2014 had been miserable since his school closed. The kindhearted boy who loved to read and learn, especially English, had long dreamed of becoming a teacher. When his education ended, he told his father through tears that his life was over. Ullah promised to try and find money for private school, but as a widower caring for four children, it was impossible.",
      "The teen hatched a plan, which he shared in secret with his big sister, Bibi: He would go with a trafficker to Malaysia, and find a future there. Bibi tried to talk him out of it; traffickers who take children on the long, dangerous journey generally detain the youngsters at the end until their parents pay a fee for their release. The children of parents who can\u2019t pay are often tortured, and sometimes killed. Bibi warned her brother that their father would never be able to afford the trafficker\u2019s payment.",
      "But Mohammed didn\u2019t care. \u201cIt\u2019s better to withstand two years of torture than stay here in a hopeless camp,\u201d he told his sister. \u201cIt\u2019s better to die if I can\u2019t continue learning.\u201d",
      "In a panic, Bibi shared her brother\u2019s plan with their father, who was horrified; he knew how deadly the journey to Malaysia can be. He ordered his son to stay put, and to stay patient. The schools will reopen someday, he assured Mohammed. But the teen was convinced they would not.",
      "And so, one morning in October, Mohammed left his family\u2019s shelter and never returned. Ullah scoured the camps and called relatives, searching for any trace of his son. He couldn\u2019t sleep, couldn\u2019t eat. He has already lost another son, an 8-year-old who suddenly died on the anniversary of Ullah\u2019s wife\u2019s death, after crying all day about missing his mother and then saying he felt unwell. The prospect of losing one more child was unbearable.",
      "Mohammed\u2019s call came on Oct. 21. And then, for over six weeks, there was silence.",
      "On Dec. 6, Ullah\u2019s phone finally rang. It was Mohammed \u2014 still alive, but sick and sobbing. The traffickers were demanding 380,000 taka ($3,100) for his release \u2014 an astronomical sum that Ullah told Mohammed he did not have. But the terrified boy begged his father to try and find it.",
      "Ullah knew if couldn\u2019t, his son would likely be killed. And so he pleaded with anyone he could think of for any money they could spare. In the end, he collected just enough, and Mohammed was set free in Malaysia.",
      "Ullah does not know what will become of his boy, who is still so young and wandering around a country that is alien to him.",
      "\u201cIf he could have continued his studies, he could have been a teacher, he could have stayed near me,\u201d Ullah says, blinking back tears. \u201cNow he\u2019s left me and I can\u2019t see him. So I lost my dream, too.\u201d",
      "His voice cracks as he describes what was long one of his greatest joys: The sight of his son coming home from school, backpack slung across his shoulders.",
      "Now, the stacks of workbooks Mohammed once pored over sit in his bedroom, untouched. His brown sandals are propped against the wall, alongside the sparkly pink sneakers belonging to the sister who tried in vain to stop him.",
      "And, hanging from a piece of bamboo, gathering dust, is his backpack.",

      "India\u2019s air-quality crisis is deepened by unreliable data",
      "NEW DELHI -- Recent remarks about pollution from two Indian officials have increased frustration among residents who say policymakers are unwilling to acknowledge the severity of India's air quality crisis.",
      "When Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav told Parliament earlier this month that India\u2019s capital, New Delhi, has seen 200 days with good air quality readings, pollution experts and opposition leaders said he chose a figure that overlooked the worst pollution months.",
      "A week later, Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta said the air quality index \u2014 a measure of air pollution \u2014 was similar to a temperature reading and could be dealt with by spraying water. Crowds jeered her at a subsequent public event, shouting \u201cAQI\u201d in reference to the city's poor air quality readings.",
      "Gupta had also greenlit a controversial cloud seeding program earlier this year, saying it could produce rain that would lower pollution \u2014 despite lack of evidence that the approach would work.",
      "Residents in New Delhi and surrounding areas engulfed in toxic smog over the last few months said these are just the latest examples of officials denying the severity of air quality problems.",
      "\u201cInstead of doing cloud seeding, I hope the government will wake up and take some real action,\u201d said Anita, a 73-year-old New Delhi resident who goes by only one name. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame.\"",
      "Environmentalists and data experts said India\u2019s air quality measurement standards are looser than in countries such as the United States, so moderate readings often mask dangerous pollution levels. India's government air quality standards are also less stringent than World Health Organization guidelines.",
      "Experts said these gaps can erode public trust, even as few residents fully grasp how harmful polluted air is.",
      "India\u2019s air quality is measured through a nationwide network of monitors and sensors, as well as satellite data.",
      "The monitors collect robust data, but there are too few of them, said Ronak Sutaria, CEO of Respirer Living, which builds machines and software for air quality monitoring. He said that the system falls short of letting citizens know how polluted the air in their neighborhoods really is.",
      "In 2019, India launched the National Clean Air Program, which set targets aiming to reduce pollution by up to 40% in 131 cities by 2026.",
      "The program has seen relative success, providing millions of dollars for monitors and water-spraying machines to reduce dust generated from vehicles plying the roads, construction activity and winds that blow desert sand into the cities.",
      "However, air pollution experts said the program has done little to reduce pollution from carbon-spewing industries or vehicle emissions, which are among the biggest sources of dirty air. Other sources include the burning of crop stubble on farms, use of wood and cow dung as cooking fuel and burning of garbage.",
      "A 2024 report by the Centre for Science and Environment, a New Delhi-based think tank, found that 64% of funds under the program went toward reducing dust and only 12% to reducing pollution from vehicles and less than 1% to bringing down industrial air pollution.",
      "\u201cWe are making huge investments in air quality monitoring. And so when we are expanding, then it also becomes an imperative that we should be focusing on the quality,\u201d said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director at the think tank.",
      "A study last year by the medical journal Lancet linked long-term exposure to polluted air to 1.5 million additional deaths every year in India, compared to a scenario where the country would have met WHO standards.",
      "Yet earlier this month, Prataprao Jadhav, India\u2019s junior health minister, said there is no conclusive data available in the country to establish a direct correlation of death or disease exclusively to air pollution.",
      "Shweta Narayan, a campaign lead at the Global Climate and Health Alliance, said that air pollution is still not taken seriously as a public health issue.",

      "Jha said authorities are not being honest about the problem and that there is a lack of political will to address the issue.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s more headline and image management than pollution management,\u201d he said, adding that the high levels of pollution have been treated as normal by political leaders.",

The decision to launch the construction of this very large-scale program was taken this week,\u201d Macron told French troops stationed in Abu Dhabi.",

      "A ceasefire agreement in October was rushed to ensure it could be witnessed by U.S. President Donald Trump and lacked sufficient details to ensure the deal to end the armed conflict would hold, Thai Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow said Monday after an Association of Southeast Asian Nations foreign ministers\u2019 meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",
      "While Cambodia has publicy said it is ready for an unconditional ceasefire, Bangkok never received any direct proposal and Thailand believed such statements were aimed at increasing international pressure rather than resolving the issue, Sihasak said following the meeting that was arranged to seek ways to end the crisis.",

      "The border conflict escalated into deadly combat two weeks ago and derailed the agreement promoted by Trump, which ended five days of fighting in July. The agreement was brokered by Malaysia and pushed through under pressure from Trump, who threatened to withhold trade privileges unless Thailand and Cambodia agreed. The ceasefire was formalized with more detail at an October regional summit in Malaysia attended by Trump.",
      "The fighting has drawn international concern. The U.S. Department of State on Sunday released a statement calling for Thailand and Cambodia to \u201cend hostilities, withdraw heavy weapons, cease emplacement of landmines, and fully implement the Kuala Lumpur Peace Accords, which include mechanisms to accelerate humanitarian demining and address border issues.\u201d",
      "The fighting is a result of a dispute over patches of territory claimed by both nations along their shared border.",
      "The latest round of fighting began Dec. 8, a day after a border skirmish wounded two Thai soldiers. Since then combat has broken out on several fronts, with Thailand carrying out airstrikes in Cambodia with F-16 fighter jets and Cambodia firing thousands of medium-range BM-21 rockets from truck-mounted launchers that can launch up to 40 rockets simultaneously.",
      "More than three dozen people on both sides of the border have officially been reported killed in the past week of fighting, while more than half a million have been displaced, according to officials.",
      "Under the October truce Thailand was to to release 18 Cambodian soldiers held prisoner and both sides were to begin removing heavy weapons and land mines along the border. But the two countries have carried on a bitter propaganda war with minor cross-border violence.",

    "story": [
      "Dickson Ngome's farm at Lake Naivasha in Kenya's Rift Valley has been submerged due to rising water levels",
      "NAIVASHA, Kenya -- When Dickson Ngome first leased his farm at Lake Naivasha in Kenya\u2019s Rift Valley in 2008, it was over 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) from shore. The farm was on 1.5 acres (0.6 hectares) of fertile land where he grew vegetables to sell at local markets.",
      "At the time, the lake was receding and people were worried that it might dry up altogether. But since 2011, the shore has crept ever closer. The rains started early this year, in September, and didn't let up for months.",
      "One morning in late October, Ngome and his family woke up to find their home and farm inside the lake. The lake levels had risen overnight and about a foot of water covered everything.",
      "\u201cIt seemed as if the lake was far from our homes,\u201d Ngome\u2019s wife, Rose Wafula, told The Associated Press. \u201cAnd then one night we were shocked to find our houses flooded. The water came from nowhere.\u201d",
      "The couple and their four children have had to leave home and are camping out on the first floor of an abandoned school nearby.",
      "Some 5,000 people were displaced by the rise in Lake Naivasha\u2019s levels this year. Some scientists attribute the higher levels to increased rains caused by climate change, although there may be other factors causing the lake\u2019s steady rise over the past decade.",
      "The lake is a tourism hot spot and surrounded by farms, mostly growing flowers, which have gradually been disappearing into the water as the lake levels rise.",
      "Rising levels have not been isolated to Naivasha: Kenya\u2019s Lake Baringo, Lake Nakuru and Lake Turkana \u2014 all in the Rift Valley \u2014 have been steadily rising for 15 years.",
      "\u201cThe lakes have risen almost beyond the highest level they have ever reached,\u201d said Simon Onywere, who teaches environmental planning at Kenyatta University in Kenya\u2019s capital Nairobi.",
      "A study in the Journal of Hydrology last year found that lake areas in East Africa increased by 71,822 square kilometers (27,730 square miles) between 2011 and 2023. That affects a lot of people: By 2021, more than 75,000 households had been displaced across the Rift Valley, according to a study commissioned that year by the Kenyan Environment Ministry and the United Nations Development Program.",
      "In Baringo, the submerged buildings that made headlines in 2020 and 2021 are still underwater.",
      "\u201cIn Lake Baringo, the water rose almost 14 meters,\u201d Onywere said. \u201cEverything went under, completely under. Buildings will never be seen again, like the Block Hotels of Lake Baringo.\u201d",

      "Significant research has gone into the reasons behind the rising lakes phenomenon: A 2021 study on the rise of Kenya\u2019s Rift Valley lakes was coauthored by Kenyan meteorologist Richard Muita, who is now acting assistant director of the Kenya Meteorological Department.",
      "\u201cThere are researchers who come up with drivers that are geological, others with reasons like planetary factors,\u201d Muita said. \u201cThe Kenya Meteorological Department found that the water level rises are associated with rainfall patterns and temperature changes. When the rains are plentiful, it aligns with the increase in the levels of the Rift Valley lake waters.\u201d",

      "Naivasha\u2019s official high water mark was demarcated at 1,892.8 meters (6,210 feet) above sea level by the Riparian Association in 1906, and is still used by surveyors today. That means this year\u2019s flooding was still almost a meter (3 feet) below the high mark.",
      "It also means that the community of Kihoto on Lake Naivasha where the Ngomes lived lies on riparian land \u2014 land that falls below the high water mark, and can only be owned by the government.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a mess established by the government \u2026 towards the late 1960s,\u201d said Silas Wanjala, general manager of the Lake Naivasha Riparian Association, which was founded some 120 years ago and has been keeping meticulous records of the lake\u2019s water levels since.",
      "Back then, a farmer was given a \u201ctemporary agricultural lease\u201d on Kihoto, said Wanjala. When it later flooded and the farmer packed up and left, the farmworkers stayed on the land and later applied for subdivisions, which were approved. In the 60-odd years since, a whole settlement has grown on land that is officially not for lease or sale.",
      "This also isn\u2019t the first time it\u2019s been flooded, said Wanjala. It's just very rare that the water comes up this high. That\u2019s little consolation for the people who have been displaced by this year\u2019s floods and now cannot go home without risking confrontations with hippopotamuses.",
      "To support those people, the county is focusing its efforts on where the need is greatest.",
      "\u201cWe are tackling this as an emergency,\" says Joyce Ncece, chief officer for disaster management in Nakuru County, which oversees Lake Naivasha. \u201cThe county government has provided trucks to help families relocate. We have been helping to pay rent for those who lack the finances.\u201d",
      "Scientists like Onywere and Muita are hoping for longer-term solutions. \u201cCould we have predicted this so that we could have done better infrastructure in less risk-prone areas?\u201d Onywere said.",
      "Muita wants to see a more concerted global effort to combat climate change, as well as local, nature-based solutions centered on Indigenous knowledge, such as \u201cconservation agriculture, where there is very limited disturbance of the land,\u201d to reduce sedimentation of the lakes.",
      "But all of this is of little help to Ngome and Wafula, who are still living at the school with their children. As the rest of the world looks forward to the holidays and new year, their future is uncertain. Lake Naivasha\u2019s continuous rise over the past 15 years does not bode well: They have no idea when, or if, their farm will ever be back on dry land.",

      "Two NATO-nation intelligence services suspect Russia is developing a new anti-satellite weapon to target Elon Musk's Starlink constellation with destructive orbiting clouds of shrapnel, with the aim of reining in Western space superiority that has helped Ukraine on the battlefield.",
      "Intelligence findings seen by The Associated Press say the so-called \u201czone-effect\u201d weapon would seek to flood Starlink orbits with hundreds of thousands of high-density pellets, potentially disabling multiple satellites at once but also risking catastrophic collateral damage to other orbiting systems.",
      "Analysts who haven't seen the findings say they doubt such a weapon could work without causing uncontrollable chaos in space for companies and countries, including Russia and its ally China, that rely on thousands of orbiting satellites for communications, defense and other vital needs.",
      "Such repercussions, including risks to its own space systems, could steer Moscow away from deploying or using such a weapon, analysts said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t buy it. Like, I really don\u2019t,\u201d said Victoria Samson, a space-security specialist at the Secure World Foundation who leads the Colorado-based nongovernmental organization\u2019s annual study of anti-satellite systems. \u201cI would be very surprised, frankly, if they were to do something like that.\u201d",
      "But the commander of the Canadian military's Space Division, Brig. Gen. Christopher Horner, said such Russian work cannot be ruled out in light of previous U.S. allegations that Russia also has been pursuing an indiscriminate nuclear, space-based weapon.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019ve been briefed on that type of system. But it\u2019s not implausible,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the reporting on the nuclear weapons system is accurate and that they\u2019re willing to develop that and willing to go to that end, well it wouldn\u2019t strike me as shocking that something just short of that, but equally damaging, is within their wheelhouse of development.\u201d",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov didn't respond to messages from the AP seeking comment. Russia has previously called for United Nations efforts to stop the orbital deployment of weapons and President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow has no intention of deploying nuclear space weapons.",
      "The intelligence findings were shown to the AP on condition that the services involved were not identified and the news organization was not able to independently verify the findings' conclusions.",
      "The U.S. Space Force didn't respond to e-mailed questions. The French military's Space Command said in a statement to the AP that it could not comment on the findings but said, \u201cWe can inform you that Russia has, in recent years, been multiplying irresponsible, dangerous, and even hostile actions in space.\u201d",
      "Russia views Starlink in particular as a grave threat, the findings indicate. The thousands of low-orbiting satellites have been pivotal for Ukraine\u2019s survival against Russia's full-scale invasion, now in its fourth year.",
      "Starlink's high-speed internet service is used by Ukrainian forces for battlefield communications, weapons targeting and other roles and by civilians and government officials where Russian strikes have affected communications.",
      "Russian officials repeatedly have warned that commercial satellites serving Ukraine's military could be legitimate targets. This month, Russia said it has fielded a new ground-based missile system, the S-500, which is capable of hitting low-orbit targets.",
      "Unlike a missile that Russia tested in 2021 to destroy a defunct Cold War-era satellite, the new weapon in development would target multiple Starlinks at once, with pellets possibly released by yet-to-be launched formations of small satellites, the intelligence findings say.",
      "Canada's Horner said it is hard to see how clouds of pellets could be corralled to only strike Starlink and that debris from such an attack could get \u201cout of control in a hurry.\u201d",
      "\"You blow up a box full of BBs,\u201d he said. Doing that would \u201cblanket an entire orbital regime and take out every Starlink satellite and every other satellite that\u2019s in a similar regime. And I think that\u2019s the part that is incredibly troubling.\u201d",
      "The findings seen by the AP didn't say when Russia might be capable of deploying such a system nor detail whether it has been tested or how far along research is believed to be.",

      "Pope Leo XIV has urged Vatican cardinals to put their ambitions of power and personal interests aside and work instead on building communion",
      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Pope Leo XIV urged Vatican cardinals on Monday to put their ambitions of power and personal interests aside, as he followed in Pope Francis\u2019 footsteps and used a Christmas greeting to gently criticize his closest collaborators.",
      "\u201cIs it possible to be friends in the Roman Curia?\u201d Leo asked the cardinals and bishops who make up the Curia, as the Holy See bureaucracy is known. \u201cTo have relationships of genuine fraternal friendship?\u201d",
      "The fact that Leo asked the question suggests that the American pope knows well that the Curia remains a difficult and sometimes toxic workplace, one that Francis would often eviscerate in his annual Christmas addresses.",
      "Leo didn\u2019t repeat Francis\u2019 more biting critique \u2014 that Vatican clergy sometimes suffer from \u201cspiritual Alzheimers,\u201d the \u201ccancer\u201d of cliques, the \u201ccorruption\u201d of ambition and \u201cself-absorbed\u201d idle gossip \u2014 and his tone was far more gentle and constructive.",

      "The November election didn't produce a bloc with a decisive majority, opening the door to a prolonged period of negotiations.",
      "The government that eventually emerges will be inheriting a security situation that has stabilized in recent years, but it will also face a fragmented parliament, growing political influence by armed factions, a fragile economy, and often conflicting international and regional pressures, including the future of Iran-backed armed groups.",
      "Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani's party took the largest number of seats in the election. Al-Sudani positioned himself in his first term as a pragmatist focused on improving public services and managed to keep Iraq on the sidelines of regional conflicts.",

      "In the election, Shiite alliances and lists \u2014 dominated by the Coordination Framework parties \u2014 secured 187 seats, Sunni groups 77 seats, Kurdish groups 56 seats, in addition to nine seats reserved for members of minority groups.",

      "Shoppers \u201ccome in knowing what they\u2019ve seen on TikTok, but our beauty advisers really help them discover what is the perfect scent for them,\u201d said Nicolette Bosco, vice president and divisional merchandise manager of Macy's beauty business.",
      "To understand the changing retail environment for beauty products, I received a taste of sales training the week before Black Friday at the flagship Macy's in New York City that served as the setting for the 1947 Christmas movie \u201cA Miracle on 34th Street.\u201d",
      "Virginia Dervil, a business manager for Parfum Christian Dior, trains beauty advisers for the makeup and fragrance division of the Dior brand. She spent roughly 30 minutes explaining Dior's fragrance lineup and offering advice on how to approach shoppers. On a busy Friday, I tried to put her teaching to the test during another half-hour standing in front of a Dior counter.",
      "In that time, I enticed only three people to try out scents and didn't make a single sale. I found it difficult \u2014 and at times frustrating \u2014 to get the attention of passing shoppers. When customers did pause by the counter, most wanted to explore alone.",
      "Here are four things I learned:",
      "Always smile at shoppers as they walk by and try complimenting them on what they're wearing, Dervil said. If they moved on, I knew enough not to follow them. Remember the old sales adage about the importance of direct eye contact. It's more crucial than ever since many customers will be wearing earbuds or headphones and might not hear a spoken invitation to sample products.",
      "If customers stop by the counter, ask if they want help. If they say no, let them explore and don't be pushy. They often start asking questions if you let them linger a while, Dervil said.",

      "Ask shoppers what they are looking for once they indicate they want help, Dervil said. \u201cAre they looking for themselves or is it a gift for someone?\u201d is a standard approach, she said. Understanding what brought someone into the store is a way to better guide them in making a selection.",
      "Always direct customers first to the fragrance in the middle of the spectrum between subtle and strong. The midpoint is typically the most popular. In Dior's J'Adore line, the favorite version is the \u201ceau de parfum,\" Dervil said. If a customer think that's too strong or too light, direct them accordingly, she advised.",
      "I also learned that going up or down the spectrum doesn't always mean a more diffused or intense version of the same scent. It may lead to a different smell altogether.",
      "For example, the \u201cparfum d\u2019eau\u201d form of J'Adore smelled like a lighter version of the \u201ceau de parfum.\u201d But the line's lightest scent, J'Adore Eau Lumiere, had a citrusy scent that was totally different.",
      "Don't spray or dab on shoppers. Instead, spritz three times on a paper test strip and let it sit for a few seconds before the customer smells it, Dervil advised. Otherwise, the initial whiff may be too overwhelming, she said.",
      "Start asking open-ended questions about what they like or don't like about the scent. If they want to try other products, fold the strip and place it next to the just-sampled fragrance as a reminder of which one it was.",
      "If they're switching from scent to scent, ask them to sniff their arm or the back of their hand to clear their nostrils for the next one, Dervil said.",
      "If a customer likes a scent, discuss prices and bottle sizes, and hope to complete the sale.",

      "ROME -- Tourists visiting the Trevi Fountain are now going to pay more than just the legendary coin toss over their shoulder to get the Instagrammable selfie in front of one of the world\u2019s most celebrated waterworks.",
      "Starting Feb. 1, the city of Rome is imposing a 2-euro ($2.35) fee for tourists to get close to the fountain made famous by Federico Fellini\u2019s \u201cLa Dolce Vita\u201d during prime-time daylight hours. The view for those admiring the late Baroque masterpiece from the piazza above remains free.",
      "The tourist fee announced Friday is part of the Eternal City\u2019s efforts to manage tourist flows in a particularly congested part of town, improve the experience and offset the maintenance costs of preserving all of Rome\u2019s cultural heritage. Officials estimate it could net the city 6.5 million euros ($7.6 million) extra a year.",
      "The fee, which has been discussed and debated for more than a year, follows a similar ticketing system at Rome\u2019s Pantheon monument and the more complicated tourist day-tripper tax that the lagoon city of Venice imposed last year in a bid to ease overtourism and make the city more liveable for residents.",
      "In such cases, city residents have been exempt from the fees. The same holds true at Trevi, while the tourist tax and new 5-euro (nearly $6) tourist ticket fee for some city museums is being rolled out in conjunction with a plan to broaden the number of museums that are free for registered Roman residents.",
      "\u201cWe believe that culture is a fundamental right of citizenship,\u201d Rome Mayor Roberto Gualtieri told a news conference. \u201cWe think it\u2019s correct and positive that the citizens of Rome can enjoy our museums free of charge.\u201d",
      "At the same time, he said, the 2-euro ($2.35) Trevi tourist fee is a minimal amount that shouldn't discourage visitors, but rather allow for a more organized visit. The city decided to impose it after seeing positive results already from a yearlong experiment to stagger and limit the number of visitors who can reach the front basin edge of the fountain by imposing lines and an entrance and exit pathway.",

      "The pay package pads Musk's current fortune of $679 billion.",
      "Elon Musk, already the world's richest man, scored another huge windfall Friday when the Delaware Supreme Court reversed a decision that deprived him of a $55 billion pay package that Tesla doled out in 2018 as an incentive for its CEO to steer the automaker to new heights.",
      "Besides padding Musk's current fortune of $679 billion, the restoration of the 2018 pay package vindicates his long-held belief that the Delaware legal system had overstepped its bounds in January 2024 when Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick rescinded the compensation in a case brought by a disgruntled Tesla shareholder.",
      "Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment late Friday.",
      "McCormick's ruling so incensed Musk that it spurred him to spurn Delaware and reincorporate Tesla in Texas. That decision also caused Tesla's board to scramble for ways to keep its CEO happy, including a successful effort to persuade the company's shareholders to reaffirm the pay package, which was valued at $44.9 billion at the time of the second vote 18 months ago.",
      "With Musk still signaling discontent, Tesla upped the ante again this year by crafting another pay package that could pay him $1 trillion if he can lead the automaker down a road during the next decade that lifts the company's market value from its current $1.6 trillion to $8.5 trillion. Shareholders approved that pay package last month, to Musk's delight.",
      "That may sound like a difficult task, but it also appeared like a long shot for Musk to hit all the targets to qualify for the payout that was dangled in the 2018 package. At that time, Tesla was still struggling to expand its production of electric vehicles and burning through cash.",

But then the company's manufacturing problems eased, enabling it to start meeting hot demand for its vehicles, which in turn pumped up its sales and stock price to a level that qualified Musk for the big payout that had been promised him.",
      "But based on evidence that included Musk's testimony during a 2022 trial, McCormick ruled the pay package had been crafted by a board that was too cozy and beholden to the hard-charging Musk.",
      "In its 49-page ruling, the Delaware Supreme Court cited a variety of errors in McCormick's 2024 decision and declared the 2018 pay package should be restored. It also awarded Tesla $1 in nominal damages.",

      "Lawmakers across the U.S. will be debating whether to adopt new federal tax breaks for tips, overtime and business expenses",
      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- To tax tips or not? That is a question that will confront lawmakers in states across the U.S. as they convene for work next year.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is urging states to follow its lead by enacting a slew of new tax breaks for individuals and businesses, including deductions for tips and overtime wages, automobile loans and business equipment.",
      "In some states, the new federal tax breaks will automatically apply to state income taxes unless legislatures opt out. But in many other states, where tax laws are written differently, the new tax breaks won't appear on state tax forms unless legislatures opt in.",
      "In states that don't conform to the federal tax changes, workers who receive tips or overtime \u2014 for example \u2014 will pay no federal tax on those earnings but could still owe state taxes on them.",
      "States that embrace all of Trump's tax cuts could provide hundreds of millions of dollars of annual savings to certain residents and businesses. But that could financially strain states, which are being hit with higher costs because of new Medicaid and SNAP food aid requirements that also are included in the big bill Trump signed.",
      "Most states begin their annual legislative sessions in January. To retroactively change tax breaks for 2025, lawmakers would need to act quickly so tax forms could updated before people begin filing them. States also could apply the changes to their 2026 taxes, a decision requiring less haste.",
      "So far, only a few states have taken votes on whether to adopt the tax breaks.",
      "\u201cStates in general are approaching this skeptically,\" said Carl Davis, research director at the nonprofit Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.",
      "A bill Trump signed on July 4 contains about $4.5 trillion of federal tax cuts over 10 years.",
      "It creates temporary tax deductions for tips, overtime and loan interest on new vehicles assembled in the U.S. It boosts a tax deduction for older adults. And it temporarily raises cap on state and local tax deductions from $10,000 to $40,000, among other things. The law also provides numerous tax breaks to businesses, including the ability to immediately write off 100% of the cost of equipment and research.",
      "Forty-one states levy individual income taxes on wages and salaries. Forty-four states charge corporate income taxes.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent this month called on those states \u201cto immediately conform\u201d to the federal tax cuts and accused some Democratic-led states that haven't done so of engaging in \"political obstructionism.\u201d Though Bessent didn't mention it, many Republican-led states also have not decided whether to implement the tax deductions.",
      "\u201cBy denying their residents access to these important tax cuts, these governors and legislators are forcing hardworking Americans to shoulder higher state tax burdens, robbing them of the relief they deserve and exacerbating the financial squeeze on low- and middle-income households,\u201d Bessent said.",
      "But some tax analysts contend there's more for states to consider. The tax break on tips, for example, could apply to nearly 70 occupation fields under a proposed rule from the Internal Revenue Service. But that would still exclude numerous low-wage workers, said Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the nonprofit Tax Foundation.",

But Colorado opted out of the state tax break for overtime shortly before the federal law was enacted.",
      "Michigan this fall became first \u2014 and, so far, only \u2014 state to opt into the tax breaks for tips and overtime wages, effective in 2026. The overtime tax exemption is projected to cost the state nearly $113 million and the tips tax break about $45 million during its current budget year, according to the state treasury department.",
      "Michigan lawmakers offset that by decoupling from five federal corporate tax changes the state's treasury estimated would have reduced Michigan tax revenues by $540 million this budget year.",

      "\u201cThe best path forward is to have more money in people\u2019s pockets and have less regulation \u2014 and this kind of moved in that direction,\u201d she said.",

Katie Hobbs has called upon lawmakers to adopt the tax breaks for tips, overtime, seniors and vehicle loans, and follow the federal government by also increasing the state's standard deduction for individual income taxpayers. Republican state House leaders said they stand ready to pass the tax cuts when their session begins Jan. 12.",

He said states already stand to lose money because of other provisions in Trump's big bill, such as a requirement to cover more of the costs of running the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.",

      "U.S. President Donald Trump announced Friday that nine drugmakers have agreed to lower the cost of their prescription drugs in the U.S.",
      "Pharmaceutical companies Amgen, Bristol Myers Squibb, Boehringer Ingelheim, Genentech, Gilead Sciences, GSK, Merck, Novartis and Sanofi will now rein in Medicaid drug prices to match what they charged in other developed countries.",
      "As part of the deal, new drugs made by those companies will also be charged at the so-called \u201cmost-favored-nation\u201d pricing across the country on any newly launched medications for all, including commercial and cash pay markets as well as Medicare and Medicaid.",
      "Drug prices for patients in the U.S. can depend on a number of factors, including the competition a treatment faces and insurance coverage. Most people have coverage through work, the individual insurance market or government programs like Medicaid and Medicare, which shield them from much of the cost.",
      "Patients in Medicaid, the state and federally funded program for people with low incomes, already pay a nominal co-payment of a few dollars to fill their prescriptions, but lower prices could help state budgets that fund the programs.",
      "Lower drug prices also will help patients who have no insurance coverage and little leverage to negotiate better deals on what they pay. But even steep discounts of 50% found through the administration\u2019s website could still leave patients paying hundreds of dollars a month for some prescriptions.",
      "William Padula, a pharmaceutical and health economics professor at USC, said Medicaid already has the most favorable drug rates which in some cases will be close to what the \u201cmost-favored-nation\u201d price is so it remains to be seen what other impacts it could have, such as more research and development.",
      "\u201cIt can\u2019t be bad. I don\u2019t see much downside but it\u2019s hard to judge what the upside is,\u201d Padula said.",
      "And while it is significant that Trump was able to get big drugmakers to the table to negotiate lower prices, it will take years to gage how effective this initiative is in terms of more people obtaining more of the medicines they need.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s good for their stock and it\u2019s good for their future\u201d research and development, Padula said of the pharmaceutical companies. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly influential but will all this add up to a major effect? Nothing really matters here unless our health gets better as a country.\u201d",

Since the pandemic, most other central banks, like the U.S. Federal Reserve, have raised rates to counter spiking inflation and then begun cutting them to help their slowing economies recover momentum.",
      "Japan\u2019s own economy contracted at a 2.3% annual rate in the last quarter, but improved business sentiment and price pressures have led the BOJ to relent and raise rates. Here are some things to know about its decision.",
      "Since Japan's economic bubble burst in the early 1990s, the central bank has kept borrowing costs low to encourage more spending by businesses and consumers.",
      "Lower interest rates have also helped the central bank manage the country's massive national debt, which amounts to nearly triple the size of the economy.",
      "As Japan\u2019s population has aged and begun declining, its economy has slowed and that led to deflation, or falling prices due to weak demand. Even with cheap credit, investment has lagged, stunting economic growth.",

      "Crosby, who began the night one point behind Lemieux, now has 645 goals and 1,079 assists for 1,724 points in 1,387 games. It also moved him past Lemieux for the eighth-most points in NHL history.",
      "Crosby tipped Erik Karlsson\u2019s point shot at 7:58 of the first period for a goal to tie the record. He then broke the mark with 7:20 left in the period when his shot on a power play hit Bryan Rust and Rickard Rakell tapped the rebound behind Jakub Dobes.",
      "Crosby, Rust and Rakell embraced behind the net after the goal and the Penguins spilled over the bench to congratulate their captain. Later in the period, a 30-second video message recorded by Lemieux congratulating Crosby on the accomplishment was played.",
      "\u201cI knew when we played together in 2005 that you were going to be a very special player and accomplish a lot of great things in your career,\u201d Lemieux said in the message. \u201cHere we are 20 years later, you\u2019re now one of the best to ever play the game.\u201d",

      "Lemieux, the Hall of Famer, who also owned the franchise following his second retirement, became the Penguins\u2019 all-time points leader, surpassing then-assistant coach Rick Kehoe on Jan. 20, 1989, when Crosby was 17 months old. Lemieux, who was in the lineup when Crosby recorded his first NHL point, finished his career with 1,723 points in 915 games.",

      "Or, maybe it was coach Bob Chesney calling for a wide receiver pass on the Dukes\u2019 second series of the evening. Even 12th-ranked James Madison successfully pulling off a fake punt could have adequately explained what the scoreboard failed to convey.",
      "It was clear that the fifth-ranked Oregon Ducks were in a different class than their visitors in a 51-34 win in a College Football Playoff first round matchup Saturday at Autzen Stadium. Oregon led 48-13 midway through the third quarter before the Dukes added three late touchdowns to make the final score appear closer than the game really was.",
      "\u201cI think the scoreboard itself, every time we got down there we kind of shot ourselves in the foot,\u201d Chesney said. \u201cIf we did not do that, if we did not end with 13 penalties, is this a little bit of a different game? Maybe. But at the same point in time, that\u2019s a tough offense to stop, and I think it\u2019s tough for a lot of teams in the entire country to stop.\"",
      "With James Madison\u2019s loss, Group of Five teams fell to 0-4 all-time in CFP games. No. 17 Tulane fell 41-10 to No. 6 Mississippi on Saturday, too, while Penn State beat Boise State 31-14 in last year\u2019s Fiesta Bowl.

      "\u201cWe\u2019re our conference champion and the rules are what they were, and I think there should be access for at least one G5 team moving forward,\u201d Sumrall said. \u201cI do. I think you should have given the American champion an opportunity before the ACC champion this year because we beat the ACC champion. So Duke won the ACC Championship; we beat them.\u201d",
      "To Sumrall\u2019s point, Tulane beat a pair of Power Four teams in Northwestern and Duke, but those schools combined to go 14-11 in 2025.",
      "James Madison, meanwhile, lost to its only Power Four opponent this season, with Louisville beating it 28-14 in a game in which the Dukes mustered just 263 yards of total offense. Most of the season, James Madison ran with the ball with ease against its opponents, rushing for over 300 yards in a game five times and over 200 yards in a game nine times.",
      "But on Saturday, the Dukes mostly abandoned the run after quickly falling behind, and instead often turned to Sun Belt Player of the Year and quarterback Alonza Barnett III, who attempted a career-high 48 passes in the contest. Even so, Barnett was confident his team belonged in the CFP over other Power Four schools.",
      "\u201cI believe people saw that we were meant to be on this level. When you look at the Power Four teams and whatever, the destiny is really \u2014 the ball is in your court. You control your own destiny,\u201d Barnett said. \u201cMost of those teams that didn\u2019t make it, they controlled their own destiny, and we handled what we could handle and we didn\u2019t give into outside noise.\"",

      "But where the Dukes fell flat was slowing down the Ducks\u2019 ninth-ranked scoring offense. Oregon ran the ball with ease, averaging more than 7.7 yards per attempt against James Madison\u2019s run defense that entered the contest allowing the second-fewest yards per game in the country.",
      "As has often been the case in matchups between Power Four and Group of Five teams, the greatest discrepancies existed in the trenches.

    "story": [
      "NATO-nation intelligence services believe Russia is developing a weapon to target Starlink satellites",
      "Two NATO-nation intelligence services suspect Russia is developing a new anti-satellite weapon to target Elon Musk's Starlink constellation with destructive orbiting clouds of shrapnel, with the aim of reining in Western space superiority that has helped Ukraine on the battlefield.",
      "Intelligence findings seen by The Associated Press say the so-called \u201czone-effect\u201d weapon would seek to flood Starlink orbits with hundreds of thousands of high-density pellets, potentially disabling multiple satellites at once but also risking catastrophic collateral damage to other orbiting systems.",
      "Analysts who haven't seen the findings say they doubt such a weapon could work without causing uncontrollable chaos in space for companies and countries, including Russia and its ally China, that rely on thousands of orbiting satellites for communications, defense and other vital needs.",
      "Such repercussions, including risks to its own space systems, could steer Moscow away from deploying or using such a weapon, analysts said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t buy it. Like, I really don\u2019t,\u201d said Victoria Samson, a space-security specialist at the Secure World Foundation who leads the Colorado-based nongovernmental organization\u2019s annual study of anti-satellite systems. \u201cI would be very surprised, frankly, if they were to do something like that.\u201d",
      "But the commander of the Canadian military's Space Division, Brig. Gen. Christopher Horner, said such Russian work cannot be ruled out in light of previous U.S. allegations that Russia also has been pursuing an indiscriminate nuclear, space-based weapon.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019ve been briefed on that type of system. But it\u2019s not implausible,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the reporting on the nuclear weapons system is accurate and that they\u2019re willing to develop that and willing to go to that end, well it wouldn\u2019t strike me as shocking that something just short of that, but equally damaging, is within their wheelhouse of development.\u201d",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov didn't respond to messages from the AP seeking comment. Russia has previously called for United Nations efforts to stop the orbital deployment of weapons and President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow has no intention of deploying nuclear space weapons.",
      "The intelligence findings were shown to the AP on condition that the services involved were not identified and the news organization was not able to independently verify the findings' conclusions.",
      "The U.S. Space Force didn't respond to e-mailed questions. The French military's Space Command said in a statement to the AP that it could not comment on the findings but said, \u201cWe can inform you that Russia has, in recent years, been multiplying irresponsible, dangerous, and even hostile actions in space.\u201d",
      "Russia views Starlink in particular as a grave threat, the findings indicate. The thousands of low-orbiting satellites have been pivotal for Ukraine\u2019s survival against Russia's full-scale invasion, now in its fourth year.",
      "Starlink's high-speed internet service is used by Ukrainian forces for battlefield communications, weapons targeting and other roles and by civilians and government officials where Russian strikes have affected communications.",
      "Russian officials repeatedly have warned that commercial satellites serving Ukraine's military could be legitimate targets. This month, Russia said it has fielded a new ground-based missile system, the S-500, which is capable of hitting low-orbit targets.",
      "Unlike a missile that Russia tested in 2021 to destroy a defunct Cold War-era satellite, the new weapon in development would target multiple Starlinks at once, with pellets possibly released by yet-to-be launched formations of small satellites, the intelligence findings say.",
      "Canada's Horner said it is hard to see how clouds of pellets could be corralled to only strike Starlink and that debris from such an attack could get \u201cout of control in a hurry.\u201d",
      "\"You blow up a box full of BBs,\u201d he said. Doing that would \u201cblanket an entire orbital regime and take out every Starlink satellite and every other satellite that\u2019s in a similar regime. And I think that\u2019s the part that is incredibly troubling.\u201d",
      "The findings seen by the AP didn't say when Russia might be capable of deploying such a system nor detail whether it has been tested or how far along research is believed to be.",
      "The system is in active development and information about the timing of an expected deployment is too sensitive to share, according to an official familiar with the findings and other related intelligence that the AP did not see. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the nonpublic findings.",

      "Samson suggested the specter of a supposed new Russian threat may also be an effort to elicit an international response.",
      "\u201cOften times people pushing these ideas are doing it because they want the U.S. side to build something like that or ... to justify increased spending on counterspace capabilities or using it for a more hawkish approach on Russia,\u201d she said.",

      "The intelligence findings say the pellets would be so small \u2014 just millimeters across \u2014 that they would evade detection by ground- and space-based systems that scan for space objects, which could make it hard to pin blame for any attack on Moscow.",
      "Clayton Swope, who specializes in space security and weaponry at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, D.C.-based security and policy think tank, said if \u201cthe pellets are not trackable, that complicates things\u201d but \u201cpeople would figure it out.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf satellites start winking out with damage, I guess you could put two and two together,\" he said.",
      "Exactly how much destruction tiny pellets could do isn't clear. In November, a suspected impact by a small piece of debris was sufficient to damage a Chinese spacecraft that was meant to bring three astronauts back to the Earth.",
      "\u201cMost damage would probably be done to the solar panels because they\u2019re probably the most fragile part\u201d of satellites, Swope said. \u201cThat\u2019d be enough, though, to damage a satellite and probably bring it offline.\u201d",
      "After such an attack, pellets and debris would over time fall back toward Earth, possibly damaging other orbiting systems on their way down, analysts say.",
      "Starlink's orbits are about 550 kilometers (340 miles) above the planet. China\u2019s Tiangong space station and the International Space Station operate at lower orbits, \u201cso both would face risks,\u201d according to Swope.",
      "The space chaos that such a weapon could cause might enable Moscow to threaten its adversaries without actually having to use it, Swope said.",
      "\u201cIt definitely feels like a weapon of fear, looking for some kind of deterrence or something,\u201d he said.",
      "Samson said the drawbacks of an indiscriminate pellet-weapon could steer Russia off such a path.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve invested a huge amount of time and money and human power into being, you know, a space power,\u201d she said.",
      "Using such a weapon \u201cwould effectively cut off space for them as well,\u201d Samson said. \u201dI don't know that they would be willing to give up that much.\"",

      "The challenge for schools was highlighted this fall when AI-generated nude images swept through a Louisiana middle school. Two boys ultimately were charged, but not before one of the victims was expelled for starting a fight with a boy she accused of creating the images of her and her friends.",
      "\u201cWhile the ability to alter images has been available for decades, the rise of A.I. has made it easier for anyone to alter or create such images with little to no training or experience,\u201d Lafourche Parish Sheriff Craig Webre said in a news release. \u201cThis incident highlights a serious concern that all parents should address with their children.\u201d",
      "Here are key takeaways from AP's story on the rise of AI-generated nude images and how schools are responding.",
      "The prosecution stemming from the Louisiana middle school deepfakes is believed to be the first under the state\u2019s new law, said Republican state Sen. Patrick Connick, who authored the legislation.",
      "The law is one of many across the country taking aim at deepfakes. In 2025, at least half the states enacted legislation addressing the use of generative AI to create seemingly realistic, but fabricated, images and sounds, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Some of the laws address simulated child sexual abuse material.",
      "Students also have been prosecuted in Florida and Pennsylvania and expelled in places like California. One fifth grade teacher in Texas also was charged with using AI to create child pornography of his students.",
      "Deepfakes started as a way to humiliate political opponents and young starlets. Until the past few years, people needed some technical skills to make them realistic, said Sergio Alexander, a research associate at Texas Christian University who has written about the issue.",

      "Instacart is ending a program where customers saw different prices for the same product ordered at the same time from the same store",
      "NEW YORK -- Instacart said Monday that it\u2019s ending a program where some customers saw different prices for the same product ordered at the same time from the same store when using the delivery company\u2019s service.",
      "The program was meant to help grocers and other retailers learn more about what kinds of prices customers would pay for items, similar to how stores offer different prices for the same products at different locations. But it raised alarms after a report from Consumer Reports and two progressive advocacy groups, Groundwork Collaborative and More Perfect Union, said Instacart offered nearly three out of every four grocery items to shoppers at multiple prices in an experiment.",
      "\u201cAt a time when families are working exceptionally hard to stretch every grocery dollar, those tests raised concerns, leaving some people questioning the prices they see on Instacart,\u201d the company said in a Monday blog post. \u201cThat\u2019s not okay \u2013 especially for a company built on trust, transparency, and affordability.\u201d",
      "Retailers will continue to set their own prices on the delivery website and they may still offer different prices at different brick-and-mortar locations, Instacart said, but \u201cfrom now on, Instacart will not support any item price testing services.\u201d",
      "Instacart said these services were neither \u201c dynamic pricing,\u201d a system where the price for something can go up when demand is high, nor \u201csurveillance pricing,\u201d where prices can be set based on a user's income, shopping history or other personal information. Instead, the company said it was offered to customers at random.",
      "Some customers would simply see a slightly higher price for an item, while others would see a slightly lower price. The experiment by Consumer Reports and the two progressive advocacy groups, for example, found that Instacart customers saw one of five different prices for the same dozen of Lucerne eggs from a Safeway store in Washington, D.C.: $3.99, $4.28, $4.59, $4.69, or $4.79.",

      "Christian influencers are reaching hundreds of thousands of young people online",
      "ATLANTA -- Millennial and Generation Z Christian influencers are increasingly filling a void in American religion, growing audiences across digital platforms by steering young people to biblical answers to tough questions that aren't always answered in Sunday sermons.",
      "\u201cI can be that in-between \u2014 Monday to Saturday help \u2014 to give you practical things to make you feel like you\u2019re not walking this walk alone,\u201d said Megan Ashley, 35, sitting cross-legged in sweats on the couch where she records her \u201cIn Totality\u201d podcast.",
      "From myriad backgrounds, these influencers talk candidly to their listeners about everything from anxieties and doubts to dating and culture, delving into the Bible\u2019s complexities. Those of faith say Christian influencers are galvanizing young people looking for meaning in a culture that lacks it at a time when years of declining church attendance has slowed.",
      "\u201cWhat they\u2019re making accessible is a truth that transforms people,\u201d said Lecrae Moore, a Christian rapper and podcaster. \u201cThere\u2019s something that\u2019s happening existentially \u2014 supernaturally \u2014 that I can\u2019t explain.\u201d",
      "Ashley and Moore are among a half-dozen popular influencers who described their work for this story. With and without formal theological they training, they describe themselves as churchgoers who don\u2019t want their messages boxed in by denominational labels.",
      "Some grew up in church; others didn\u2019t, but they commonly describe experiencing a spiritual transformation that came out of hardship or a sense of emptiness they pin on secular lifestyles.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re like, listen, we\u2019re two mess-ups too. It\u2019s OK,\u201d said Arielle Reitsma, 36, co-host of podcast \u201cGirls Gone Bible,\u201d which gets more than a million listens or streams each month.",
      "These algorithm-savvy podcasters fit comfortably in a long tradition of Christian celebrities, said Zachary Sheldon, a Baylor University lecturer on media, religion and culture who cited televangelist Billy Graham as an example. Working independently, they can harness audiences more easily than established congregations and media organizations can.",
      "\u201cExposing people to the faith and challenging them to ask questions and search for something more\u201d are really good things to do, Sheldon said. But he pointed to \u201cpotential dangers in granting them too much authority on the basis of their celebrity and their acumen with social media.\u201d",
      "These influencers encourage church attendance and describe reaching a variety of people, including those who have been particularly disconnected from religion, which polls show is a growing number of young Americans. Only 41% of people ages 18-35 surveyed in 2023-24 said they believe in God with certainty, down from 65% in 2007, according to the Pew Research Center.",
      "\u201cPeople are spiritually hungry, emotionally hungry, and I think for the first time ever \u2026 people are encountering Jesus even through online platforms, and they\u2019re realizing, this is true life and fulfillment,\u201d said Angela Halili, 29, Reitsma's co-host.",
      "The pair now draws live crowds since starting the podcast more than two years ago. At an event in Atlanta, they warned hundreds of fans against idolizing work or relationships, Bibles in hand, and recounted their days as Hollywood actors battling addiction, heartbreak and mental health disorders. Halili said God brought them \u201cradical healing,\u201d and they want listeners to know that God can perform \u201cmiracles\u201d in their lives, too.",
      "Afterward, they hugged and prayed for people in the audience, where Anna Williams, 17, said she considers both Reitsma and Halili to be \u201ca big sister\u201d in her life.",
      "Even as they espouse biblical principles as guidance toward true joy, influencers say that being Christian can be hard.",
      "God \u201cdoes make everything better, but that doesn\u2019t always come in the way that we think it\u2019s gonna come,\u201d said \u201cIn Totality\u201d host Ashley.",
      "Her current obsession, which she teaches with fervor, is a biblical passage about living as a sacrifice. God asks people to give up certain wants and behaviors so they can grow closer to him, Ashley says. She said her intensity grew after a healing encounter with God\u2019s \u201cseverity\u201d as a freshly divorced single mom plagued by suicidal thoughts and depression.",
      "Bible passages, day-to-day plights and heavier challenges are covered on \u201cWith the Perrys,\u201d a podcast led by husband and wife authors and spoken-word artists who also run a streetwear brand.",

She and husband Preston Perry, 39, started podcasting in 2019. Followers already resonated with Perry's theological debates and story of growing up around poverty and violence before finding faith and becoming a Christian evangelist.",

Through focused prayer, obedience and Bible reading, God brings lasting peace, answers and growth during hard circumstances, they say, but this requires more than quick fixes like scrolling and sex.",
      "At just 22, Bryce Crawford teaches Bible chapters on his self-named podcast and posts videos of himself talking to people about Christianity at Pride parades, the Burning Man counter-culture festival and a satanic temple.",
      "Rather than shout \u201crepent,\u201d Crawford\u2019s street evangelism aims to change minds through kindness. His followers say they're attracted by his empathetic yet bold demeanor while delivering talking points against lifestyles such as same-sex marriage.",
      "\u201cMy issue with \u2018repent or burn in hell\u2019 is that people get frustrated because they don\u2019t know why you\u2019re telling them that,\u201d said Crawford, who describes being severely anxious and bitter toward God until God healed him at a Waffle House. \u201cOur tactics have been one-on-one conversations, calmly listening, asking questions because we care about them, and in that explaining our worldview.\u201d",
      "These influencers acknowledge that online Christianity has its challenges.",
      "A hyperfocus on online drama and Christianity's more esoteric beliefs can miss the basics, such as love and Christ's sacrifice, Hill Perry said. She worries that \u201csimply talking about gentleness or respect or kindness or patience is gonna be boring\u201d to people.",
      "And the deep political and cultural rifts among Christians emerge online too.",
      "For example, Halili and Reitsma got pushback for taking the opportunity to pray at a pre-inauguration rally for President Donald Trump. The Perrys have been criticized by conservatives for talking about police brutality and racial injustice, and liberals for expressing opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion.",
      "Some followers say these influencers provide a welcome alternative to the buttoned-up pastors they grew up with who spoke of God as a faraway deity that would reject them for breaking too many rules.",
      "\u201cI really needed someone who was a younger Black female portraying something that wasn\u2019t super traditional,\u201d said Olivia Singleton, 24. She's involved with her church and likes her pastor, but feels like these influencers are like \u201cone of the girls \u2026 walking out the faith with you.\u201d",

      "Animals that navigate extreme conditions and environments have evolved to sleep in extreme ways",
      "Every animal with a brain needs sleep \u2014 and even a few without a brain do, too. Humans sleep, birds sleep, whales sleep and even jellyfish sleep.",
      "Sleep is universal \u201ceven though it\u2019s actually very risky,\u201d said Paul-Antoine Libourel, a researcher at the Neuroscience Research Center of Lyon in France.",
      "When animals nod off, they're most vulnerable to sneaky predators. But despite the risks, the need for sleep is so strong that no creature can skip it altogether, even when it's highly inconvenient.",
      "Animals that navigate extreme conditions and environments have evolved to sleep in extreme ways \u2014 for example, stealing seconds at a time during around-the-clock parenting, getting winks on the wing during long migrations and even dozing while swimming.",
      "For a long time, scientists could only make educated guesses about when wild animals were sleeping, observing when they lay still and closed their eyes. But in recent years, tiny trackers and helmets that measure brain waves \u2014 miniaturized versions of equipment in human sleep labs \u2014 have allowed researchers to glimpse for the first time the varied and sometimes spectacular ways that wild animals snooze.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re finding that sleep is really flexible in response to ecological demands,\u201d said Niels Rattenborg, an animal sleep research specialist at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Intelligence in Germany.",
      "Call it the emerging science of \u201cextreme sleep.\u201d",
      "Take chinstrap penguins in Antarctica that Libourel studies.",
      "These penguins mate for life and share parenting duties \u2014 with one bird babysitting the egg or tiny gray fluffy chick to keep it warm and safe while the other swims off to fish for a family meal. Then they switch roles \u2014 keeping up this nonstop labor for weeks.",
      "Penguin parents face a common challenge: getting enough sleep while keeping a close eye on their newborns.",
      "They survive by taking thousands of catnaps a day \u2014 each averaging just 4 seconds long.",
      "These short \u201cmicrosleeps,\" as Korea Polar Research Institute biologist Won Young Lee calls them, appear to be enough to allow penguin parents to carry out their caregiving duties for weeks within their crowded, noisy colonies.",
      "When a clumsy neighbor passes by or predatory seabirds are near, the penguin parent blinks to alert attention and soon dozes off again, its chin nodding against its chest, like a drowsy driver.",
      "The naps add up. Each penguin sleeps for a total of 11 hours per day, as scientists found by measuring the brain activity of 14 adults over 11 days on Antarctica's King George Island.",
      "To remain mostly alert, yet also sneak in sufficient winks, the penguins have evolved an enviable ability to function on extremely fractured sleep \u2014 at least during the breeding season.",
      "Researchers can now see when either hemisphere of the brain \u2014 or both at once \u2014 are asleep.",

      "In some cases, the answer is yes \u2014 as scientists discovered when they attached devices that measure brain-wave activity to the heads of large seabirds nesting in the Galapagos Islands called great frigatebirds.",
      "While flying, frigatebirds can sleep with one half of the brain at a time. The other half remains semialert so that one eye is still watching for obstacles in their flight path.",
      "This allows the birds to soar for weeks at a time, without touching land or water, which would damage their delicate, non-water repellent feathers.",
      "Frigatebirds can't do tricky maneuvers \u2014 flapping, foraging or diving \u2014 with just one half of their brain. When they dive for prey, they must be fully awake. But in flight, they have evolved to sleep when gliding and circling upward on massive drafts of warm rising air that keep them aloft with minimal effort.",
      "Back at the nest in trees or bushes, frigatebirds change up their nap routine \u2014 they are more likely to sleep with their whole brain at once and for much longer bouts. This suggests their in-flight sleeping is a specific adaptation for extended flying, Rattenborg said.",
      "A few other animals have similar sleeping hacks. Dolphins can sleep with one half of the brain at a time while swimming. Some other birds, including swifts and albatrosses, can sleep in flight, scientists say.",
      "Frigatebirds can fly 255 miles (410 kilometers) a day for more than 40 days, before touching land, other researchers found \u2014 a feat that wouldn\u2019t be possible without being able to sleep on the wing.",
      "On land, life is easy for a 5,000-pound (2,268-kilogram) northern elephant seal. But at sea, sleep is dangerous \u2014 sharks and killer whales that prey on seals are lurking.",
      "These seals go on extended foraging trips, for up to eight months, repeatedly diving to depths of several hundred feet (meters) to catch fish, squid, rays and other sea snacks.",
      "Each deep dive may last around 30 minutes. And for around a third of that time, the seals may be asleep, as research led by Jessica Kendall-Bar of Scripps Institution of Oceanography revealed.",
      "Kendall-Bar's team devised a neoprene headcap similar to a swimming cap with equipment to detect motion and seal brain activity during dives, and retrieved the caps with logged data when seals returned to beaches in Northern California.",
      "The 13 female seals studied tended to sleep during the deepest portions of their dives, when they were below the depths that predators usually patrol.",
      "That sleep consisted of both slow-wave sleep and REM sleep. During REM, or rapid eye movement sleep, the seals were temporarily paralyzed \u2014 just like humans during this deep-sleep stage \u2014 and their dive motion changed. Instead of a controlled downward glide motion, they sometimes turned upside down and spun in what the researchers called a \u201csleep spiral\u201d during REM sleep.",
      "In the span of 24 hours, the seals at sea slept for around two hours total. (Back on the beach, they averaged around 10 hours.)",
      "Scientists are still learning about all the reasons we sleep \u2014 and just how much we really need.",
      "It's unlikely that any tired human can try these extreme animal sleep hacks. But learning more about how varied napping may be in the wild shows the flexibility of some species. Nature has evolved to make shut-eye possible in even the most precarious situations.",

      "The algorithm has been a central issue in the security debate over TikTok. China previously maintained the algorithm must remain under Chinese control by law. But the U.S. regulation passed with bipartisan support said any divestment of TikTok must mean the platform cuts ties \u2014 specifically the algorithm \u2014 with ByteDance.",
      "The deal marks the end of years of uncertainty about the fate of the popular video-sharing platform in the United States. After wide bipartisan majorities in Congress passed \u2014 and President Joe Biden signed \u2014 a law that would ban TikTok in the U.S. if it did not find a new owner in the place of China\u2019s ByteDance, the platform was set to go dark on the law\u2019s January 2025 deadline. For a several hours, it did. But on his first day in office, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to keep it running while his administration tries to reach an agreement for the sale of the company.",
      "Three more executive orders followed, as Trump, without a clear legal basis, continued to extend the deadline for a TikTok deal. The second was in April, when White House officials believed they were nearing a deal to spin off TikTok into a new company with U.S. ownership that fell apart after China backed out following Trump\u2019s tariff announcement. The third came in June, then another in September, which Trump said would allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States in a way that meets national security concerns.",

      "Thefts of Hyundai and Kia vehicles soared in part because beginning in 2021, videos posted to TikTok and other social media demonstrated how someone could steal a car with just a screwdriver and a USB cable. Minneapolis reported an 836% increase in Hyundai and Kia thefts from 2021 to 2022. Ellison announced an investigation into the automakers in early 2023.",

      "Titan instead may hold deep layers of ice and slush more akin to Earth\u2019s polar seas, with pockets of melted water where life could possibly survive and even thrive, scientists reported Wednesday.",
      "The team led by researchers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory challenged the decade-long assumption of a buried global ocean at Titan after taking a fresh look at observations made years ago by NASA\u2019s Cassini spacecraft around Saturn.",
      "They stress that no one has found any signs of life at Titan, the solar system\u2019s second largest moon spanning 3,200 miles (5,150 kilometers) and brimming with lakes of liquid methane on its frosty surface.",
      "But with the latest findings suggesting a slushy, near-melting environment, \u201cthere is strong justification for continued optimism regarding the potential for extraterrestrial life,\u201d said the University of Washington\u2019s Baptiste Journaux, who took part in the study published in the journal Nature.",
      "As to what form of life that might be, possibly strictly microscopic, \u201cnature has repeatedly demonstrated far greater creativity than the most imaginative scientists,\" he said in an email.",
      "JPL\u2019s Flavio Petricca, the lead author, said Titan\u2019s ocean may have frozen in the past and is currently melting, or its hydrosphere might be evolving toward complete freezing.",
      "Computer models suggest these layers of ice, slush and water extend to a depth of more than 340 miles (550 kilometers). The outer ice shell is thought to be about 100 miles (170 kilometers) deep, covering layers of slush and pools of water that could go down another 250 miles (400 kilometers). This water could be as warm as 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius).",
      "Because Titan is tidally locked, the same side of the moon faces Saturn all the time, just like our own moon and Earth. Saturn\u2019s gravitational pull is so intense that it deforms the moon\u2019s surface, creating bulges as high as 30 feet (10 meters) when the two bodies are closest.",
      "Through improved data processing, Petricca and his team managed to measure the timing between the peak gravitational tug and the rising of Titan\u2019s surface. If the moon held a wet ocean, the effect would be immediate, Petricca said, but a 15-hour gap was detected, indicating an interior of slushy ice with pockets of liquid water. Computer modeling of Titan\u2019s orientation in space supported their theory.",

      "That was until earlier this year, when the Philadelphia hospital where he receives treatment connected him with a promising pilot project that has paired him with \u201cangel advocates\u201d \u2014 Good Samaritan strangers scattered around the country who leverage their own social media contacts to share his story.",
      "So far, the Great Social Experiment, as it was named by its founder, Los Angeles filmmaker David Krissman, hasn't found the Vineland, New Jersey, truck driver a living kidney donor. But there are encouraging early signs the angel advocate approach is working, and there's no question it has given Moreno new optimism.",
      "\u201cThis process is great,\u201d said Moreno, 50, whose own father died of kidney failure at 65. \u201cI'm just hoping there will be somebody out there that\u2019s willing to take a chance.\u201d",
      "Moreno is part of a pilot program with 15 patients that began in May at three Pennsylvania hospitals. It's testing whether motivated, volunteer strangers can help improve the chances of finding a life-saving match for a new kidney \u2014 particularly for people with limited social networks.",
      "\u201cWe know how this has always been done, and we're trying to put that on steroids and really get them the help that they need,\u201d Krissman said. \u201cMost patients are too sick to do this on their own \u2014 many don't have the skills to do it on their own.\u201d",
      "The Gift of Life Donor Program, which serves as the organ procurement network for eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware, is supporting the pilot program with a grant of more than $100,000 from its foundation.",
      "So far, two of the five patients in the program through Temple University Hospital have found kidney donors, and one is preparing for surgery, according to Ryan Ihlenfeldt, the hospital\u2019s director of clinical transplant services. One of the five patients at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Harrisburg has also undergone a transplant.",
      "The approach Krissman has developed is something new, said Richard Hasz Jr., Gift of Life's chief executive, and may help identify the types of messages that attract and motivate potential live kidney donors.",
      "\u201cThis is the first of its kind that I\u2019m aware of,\u201d Hasz said. \u201cThat\u2019s why, I think, the foundation was so interested in doing it -- studying it and hopefully publishing it \u2014 so we can create that blueprint, if you will, for the future.\u201d",
      "Gift of Life agreed to fund a broader test and helped Krissman identify five patients each at Temple, UPMC-Harrisburg and Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia.",
      "Hasz said the pilot program's approach combines social media outreach with Krissman\u2019s storytelling talents and aggressive efforts to mobilize the patients\u2019 own connections.",
      "\u201cWe know that patients who are waiting don\u2019t always have the energy or the resources to do this themselves,\u201d Hasz said.",
      "There have been other ways for patients to set up \u201c microsites \u201d where they can tell their stories and seek a donor match. But the pilot program currently underway in Pennsylvania aims to connect patients with a wide universe of potential donors and produce videos and other ways to spread their message.",
      "Krissman's bout with an illness about two decades ago inspired him to tackle the sticky challenge of increasing live kidney donations. He was debilitated for more than a year before medication helped him recover, explaining, \u201cIt gave me my life back. And I never forgot what it's like to be chronically sick.\u201d",
      "After producing a podcast on kidney transplantation, Krissman recruited four patients through Facebook who were waiting for kidneys. He was able to help two of them.

      "In an underwater nursery just off the Dominican Republic coast, tiny corals born in a laboratory are slowly growing under the eye of conservationists",
      "BAYAHIBE, Dominican Republic -- Oxygen tank strapped to his back, Michael del Rosario moves his fins delicately as he glides along an underwater nursery just off the Dominican Republic coast, proudly showing off the \u201ccoral babies\u201d growing on metal structures that look like large spiders. The conservationist enthusiastically points a finger to trace around the largest corals, just starting to reveal their vibrant colors.",
      "Del Rosario helped plant these tiny animals in the nursery after they were conceived in an assisted reproduction laboratory run by the marine conservation organization Fundemar. In a process something like in vitro fertilization, coral egg and sperm are joined to form a new individual.",
      "It's a technique that's gaining momentum in the Caribbean to counter the drastic loss of corals due to climate change, which is killing them by heating up oceans and making it more difficult for those that survive to reproduce naturally.",
      "\u201cWe live on an island. We depend entirely on coral reefs, and seeing them all disappear is really depressing,\u201d del Rosario said once back on the surface, his words flowing like bubbles underwater. \u201cBut seeing our coral babies growing, alive, in the sea gives us hope, which is what we were losing.\u201d",
      "The state of corals around the Dominican Republic, as in the rest of the world, is not encouraging. Fundemar\u2019s latest monitoring last year found that 70% of the Dominican Republic\u2019s reefs have less than 5% coral coverage. Healthy colonies are so far apart that the probability of one coral\u2019s eggs meeting another\u2019s sperm during the spawning season is decreasing.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why assisted reproduction programs are so important now, because what used to be normal in coral reefs is probably no longer possible for many species,\u201d biologist Andreina Valdez, operations manager at Fundemar, said at the organization\u2019s new marine research center. \u201cSo that\u2019s where we come in to help a little bit.\u201d",
      "Though many people may think corals are plants, they are animals. They spawn once a year, a few days after the full moon and at dusk, when they release millions of eggs and sperm in a spectacle that turns the sea around them into a kind of Milky Way. Fundemar monitors spawning periods, collects eggs and sperm, performs assisted fertilization in the laboratory, and cares for the larvae until they are strong enough to be taken to the reef.",
      "In the laboratory, Ariel \u00c1lvarez examines one of the star-shaped pieces on which the corals are growing through a microscope. They're so tiny they can hardly be seen with the naked eye. \u00c1lvarez switches off the lights, turns on an ultraviolet light, and the coral\u2019s rounded, fractal shapes appear through a camera on the microscope projected onto a screen.",
      "One research center room holds dozens of fish tanks, each with hundreds of tiny corals awaiting return to the reef. Del Rosario said the lab produces more than 2.5 million coral embryos per year. Only 1% will survive in the ocean, yet that figure is better than the rate with natural fertilization on these degraded reefs now, he said.",
      "In the past, Fundemar and other conservation organizations focused on asexual reproduction. That meant cutting a small piece of healthy coral and transplanting it to another location so that a new one would grow. The method can produce corals faster than assisted fertilization.",
      "The problem, Andreina Valdez said, is that it clones the same individual, meaning all those coral share the same disease vulnerabilities. In contrast, assisted sexual reproduction creates genetically different individuals, reducing the chance that a single illness could strike them all down.",
      "Australia pioneered assisted coral fertilization. It's expanding in the Caribbean, with leading projects at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and the Carmabi Foundation in Cura\u00e7ao, and it's being adopted in Puerto Rico, Cuba and Jamaica, Valdez said.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t conserve something if you don\u2019t have it. So (these programs) are helping to expand the population that\u2019s out there,\u201d said Mark Eakin, corresponding secretary for the International Coral Reef Society and retired chief of the Coral Reef Watch program of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "But the world must still tackle \u201cthe 800-pound gorilla of climate change,\u201d Eakin said, or a lot of the restoration work \u201cis just going to be wiped out.\u201d",
      "Burning fossil fuels such as oil, gas, and coal produces greenhouse gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, driving up temperatures both on Earth\u2019s surface and in its seas. Oceans are warming at twice the rate of 20 years ago, according to UNESCO\u2019s most recent State of the Ocean Report last year.",
      "And that's devastating for corals. Rising heat causes them to feel sick and expel the algae that live in their tissue and provide them both their striking colors and their food. The process is known as bleaching because it exposes the coral's white skeleton. The corals may survive, but they are weakened and vulnerable to disease and death if temperatures don't drop.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- California regulators are threatening to suspend Tesla's license to sell its electric cars in the state early next year unless the automaker tones down its marketing tactics for its self-driving features after a judge concluded the Elon Musk-led company has been misleading consumers about the technology's capabilities.",
      "The potential 30-day blackout of Tesla's California sales is the primary punishment being recommended to the state's Department of Motor Vehicles in a decision released late Tuesday. The ruling by Administrative Law Judge Juliet Cox determined that Tesla had for years engaged in deceptive marketing practices by using the terms \u201cAutopilot\u201d and \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d to promote the autonomous technology available in many of its cars.",
      "After presiding over five days of hearings held in Oakland, California in July, Cox also recommended suspending Tesla's license to manufacture cars at its plant in Fremont, California. But California regulators aren't going to impose that part of the judge's proposed penalty.",
      "Tesla will have a 90-day window to make changes that more clearly convey the limits of its self-driving technology to avoid having its California sales license suspended. After California regulators filed its action against Tesla in 2023, the Austin, Texas, company already made one significant change by putting in wording that made it clear its Full Self-Driving package still required supervision by a human driver while it's deployed.",
      "\u201cTesla can take simple steps to pause this decision and permanently resolve this issue \u2014 steps autonomous vehicle companies and other automakers have been able to achieve,\" said Steve Gordon, the director of the California Department of Motor Vehicles.",
      "Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.",
      "The automaker has already been plagued by a global downturn in demand that began during a backlash to Musk's high-profile role overseeing cuts in the U.S. government budget overseeing the Department of Government that President Donald Trump created in his administration. Increased competition and an older lineup of vehicles also weighed on Tesla sales, although the company did revamp its Model Y, the world\u2019s bestselling vehicle, and unveil less-expensive versions of the Model Y and Model X.",

      "Although Musk left Washington after a falling out with Trump, the fallout has continued to weigh on Tesla's auto sales, which had decreased by 9% from 2024 through the first nine months of this year.",
      "Despite the slump and the threatened sales suspension in California, Tesla's stock price touched an all-time high $495.28 during Wednesday's early trading before backtracking later to fall below $470. Despite that reversal, Tesla's shares are still worth slightly more than they were before Musk's ill-fated stint in the Trump administration \u2014 a \u201csomewhat successful\u201d assignment he recently said he wouldn't take on again.",
      "The performance of Tesla's stock against the backdrop of eroding auto sales reflects the increasing emphasis that investors are placing on Musk's efforts to develop artificial intelligence technology to implant into humanoid robots and a fleet of self-driving Teslas that will operate as robotaxis across the U.S.",
      "Musk has been promising Tesla's self-driving technology would fulfill his robotaxi vision for years without delivering on the promise, but the company finally began testing the concept in Austin earlier this year, albeit with a human supervisor in the car to take over if something went awry. Just a few days ago, Musk disclosed Tesla had started tests of its robotaxis without a safety monitor in the vehicle.",
      "California regulators are far from the first critic to accuse Tesla of exaggerating the capabilities of its self-driving technology in a potentially dangerous manner. The company has steadfastly insisted that information contained in its vehicle's owner's manual on its website have made it clear that its self-driving technology still requires human supervision, even while releasing a 2020 video depicting one of its cars purportedly driving on its own. The video, cited as evidence against Tesla in the decision recommending a suspension of the company's California sales license, remained on its website for nearly four years.",
      "Tesla has been targeted in a variety of lawsuits alleging its mischaracterizations about self-driving technology have lulled humans into a false of security that have resulted in lethal accidents. The company has settled or prevailed in several cases, but earlier this year a Miami jury held Tesla partly responsible for a lethal crash in Florida that occurred while Autopilot was deployed and ordered the automaker to pay more than $240 million in damages.",

    "story": [
      "Myanmar\u2019s military leadership has vowed to crack down on cyberscam centers, starting with the notorious KK Park",
      "It looked like a turning point in the global fight against scams. Myanmar\u2019s military leadership, under growing international pressure, vowed to wipe out the industrial-scale cyberscam centers that have taken root in the country. They started by raiding and then bombing KK Park \u2014 a notorious compound that has become a symbol of impunity in the battle against one of the most lucrative criminal industries in the world.",
      "It\u2019s too early to say whether KK Park will be abandoned, repurposed or rebuilt over time. But even if KK Park were to close, it\u2019s just one of around 30 scam compounds along Myanmar\u2019s border with Thailand \u2014 one indication that the crackdown may not turn out to be as deep or long-lasting as Myanmar\u2019s military rulers would like it to appear.",
      "The Associated Press found that at least two scam compounds in the area continued to use Starlink to get online even after SpaceX announced it had cut off service. And there are other signs the scam industry is adapting fast: The physical damage to KK Park sent thousands of workers scattering to other scam companies in Myanmar and abroad, interviews with current and former scam center workers show. Telegram is popping with job ads for newly displaced workers. And work has continued uninterrupted at other scam centers in Myanmar, where people trafficked from around the world still wait to be rescued.",
      "\u201cEven if you destroy buildings, if you haven\u2019t arrested the heads of the transnational syndicates behind this, seized their wealth and put them in jail, it\u2019s not a real crackdown yet,\u201d said Jay Kritiya, the coordinator of the Civil Society Network for Human Trafficking Victim Assistance.",
      "Myanmar state media announced the raid on KK Park on Oct. 20, which was followed by a weekslong demolition campaign. In November, Myanmar\u2019s military rulers pledged to \u201ceradicate scam activities from their roots.\u201d State media broadcast images of wreckage and soldiers standing with dozens of seized Starlink terminals. They then went after Shwe Kokko, another notorious compound that\u2019s been in the crosshairs of U.S. authorities. SpaceX announced it cut off access to more than 2,500 Starlink units in Myanmar, where they have been widely used by scammers to get online. And Meta said this month it had taken down 2,000 Facebook accounts used by scammers in Myanmar.",
      "It looked as if growing American pressure on foreign scam centers through sanctions, prosecutions and a new, high-level Scam Center Strike Force, was having swift impact as Myanmar prepares for national elections, which have been widely criticized as a sham effort to legitimize the army\u2019s 2021 seizure of power.",
      "Myanmar has said the demolition at KK Park \u2014 and raids at additional scam sites \u2014 are meant to ensure that criminal activity never returns. This month the government created a high-level task force to enact what it calls a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy against scams. The state-run Global New Light of Myanmar on Dec. 15 devoted five full pages to coverage of a press conference showcasing what it described as the government\u2019s aggressive efforts to stop fraud, and characterized cyberscams as the work of foreign criminal networks that have taken root in lawless borderlands controlled by insurgents.",
      "Government officials said that by Dec. 13, 413 buildings in KK Park had been \u201cdemolished\u201d and the remaining 222 would be cleared as well. Detailed visual analysis of the first wave of demolition, which the government says is complete, shows that 31 structures were flattened. At least 78 more were partially damaged, according to the Center for Information Resilience (CIR), a London-based nonprofit focused on exposing human rights violations.",
      "More than half the buildings were damaged by heavy machinery, which often left roofs, ceilings and layers between floors intact, said Guy Fusfus, an investigator at Myanmar Witness, a CIR project. \u201cThere may be an intention to reconstruct and reuse these buildings,\u201d he said in an email.",
      "New satellite imagery shows that most buildings in KK Park appeared wholly or partially intact on Dec. 4, even as demolition had spread to other sections of the compound. Once home to thousands of workers, many victims of human trafficking, the streets of KK Park appeared empty. Where all those people went \u2014 and what that portends for the future of a criminal industry the FBI says cost Americans more than $16 billion last year \u2014 remain open questions.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t just breaking windows and moving on. You can\u2019t come in and restart operations here at the same scale as before,\u201d said Eric Heintz, a global analyst at the International Justice Mission, a Washington, D.C.-based NGO, who reviewed satellite images of the damage. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know if that activity is just going to be displaced to other locations.\u201d",
      "Myanmar\u2019s track record of lasting enforcement is poor. Raids in response to Chinese pressure earlier this year failed to contain the growth of scam compounds, according to C4ADS, a U.S.-based nonprofit that takes a data-driven approach to conflict analysis. Over 7,000 scam center workers were released as part of that purge, according to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, but the scams kept on running.",
      "C4ADS examined satellite imagery of 21 known scam compounds in Myawaddy Township and found that 14 of them \u2014 including KK Park \u2014 had shown construction or expansion since January. Some solar panels also appeared \u2014 a step toward energy independence that could blunt the impact of crackdowns from neighboring Thailand, which has occasionally cut off power.",
      "\u201cThis continued growth of scam compounds is emblematic of the junta\u2019s inability to rein in the industry within Myanmar,\u201d said Michael Di Girolamo, a C4ADS analyst focused on cybercrime.",
      "Analysts say that some of the same people who led the raid on KK Park have profited from scams over the years. KK Park, like most scam compounds along the Thai border, operates under the protection of the Karen Border Guard Force \u2014 also known as the Karen National Army \u2014 an armed militia made up of ethnic Karen people who live in eastern Myanmar that is affiliated with the Myanmar military, according to U.S. and European government sanctions notices.",
      "Jason Tower, a senior expert at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, said the action at KK Park was a way for Myanmar\u2019s military leadership to relieve pressure, primarily from the U.S. and China, and continue to host highly lucrative criminal activity. \u201cThere\u2019s no real political will to crack down,\u201d he said.",
      "A month after KK Park was raided, another scam center fell, far from the glare of government propaganda. On Nov. 21, forces of the Karen National Union, a rebel group opposed to Myanmar\u2019s military leadership, stormed a scam compound called Shunda Park in an area controlled by a pro-government militia.",
      "\u201cThis looks much more like a real crackdown on crime,\u201d Tower said.",
      "While Myanmar state television broadcast images of a steamroller crushing rows of scammers\u2019 computers, the Karen National Union gathered 604 mobile phones, bank cards, computers and other evidence from Shunda and handed them over to Thai authorities for investigation.",

    "story": [
      "The DOJ failed to fully release all the files by last Friday.",
      "A group of alleged victims of Jeffrey Epstein accused the Department of Justice of missteps, including violations of the law, in its partial release of files related to the disgraced financier's abuse of young women and girls.",
      "The DOJ faced a Friday deadline imposed by Congress to release a massive cache of records gathered during government investigations into the sex offender, who died in jail in 2019.",
      "Justice officials released thousands of files -- ranging from investigative documents to grand jury testimony to snapshots taken by Epstein and his friends -- but said it would fail to fully release all the files by the deadline.",
      "\"Instead, the public received a fraction of the files, and what we received was riddled with abnormal and extreme redactions with no explanation,\" a group of 19 women, including two Jane Does, said in a statement released on Monday. \"At the same time, numerous victim identities were left unredacted, causing real and immediate harm.\"",
      "The statement, which was released early Monday by attorneys representing the women, also pointed to what they said was missing from the files. Omissions by either redactions or unreleased pages amounted to a failure, they said.",
      "\"No financial documents were released,\" the statement said. \"Grand jury minutes, though approved by a federal judge for release, were fully blacked out -- not the scattered redactions that might be expected to protect victim names, but 119 full pages blacked out. We are told that there are hundreds of thousands of pages of documents still unreleased.\"",
      "\"These are clear-cut violations of an unambiguous law,\" the statement added.",
      "Some documents disclosed on Friday with significant redactions were reposted early Saturday with some or all of the redactions lifted, according to a review of the files by ABC News.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said on social media on Friday, as the initial files were being released, that \"[a]dditional responsive materials will be produced as our review continues, consistent with the law and with protections for victims.\" The DOJ on Sunday released a similar statement, adding that reviews of the material would continue \"as we receive additional information.\"",
      "President Donald Trump in November had signed a bill that gave the Justice Department 30 days to release the materials.",
      "The statement from alleged victims noted that DOJ officials had structured the release of documents in a way that made it \"difficult or impossible\" for Epstein's alleged victims to find information that may be important to their cases. And they said they hadn\u2019t been contacted about potential redactions or withholdings prior to the documents' release.",
      "\"It is alarming that the United States Department of Justice, the very agency tasked with upholding the law, has violated the law, both by withholding massive quantities of documents, and by failing to redact survivor identities,\" the women\u2019s statement said.",

      "Separately on Sunday, Brittany Henderson and Brad Edwards -- attorneys who represent more than 200 survivors of Epstein and his convicted co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell -- had told ABC News that since the Epstein files were posted on Friday, they had been hearing from clients who have seen their names or other identifying information un-redacted documents in the DOJ's disclosure.",
      "Henderson and Edwards said they had been working through the weekend with federal officials in New York and D.C. to take down documents containing personal information of alleged victims, many of whom have never had their names disclosed in any context connected to Epstein.",
      "In one instance, Henderson and Edwards said, a sealed document from settled civil litigation containing the names of more than two dozen alleged victims -- was posted without redactions. That document was among those that have been removed from the DOJ's site, the lawyers said.",
      "The attorneys said that about 15 documents had by Sunday been pulled from the site -- at least temporarily -- as a result of their consultations with the government.",
      "DOJ officials said in\u00a0a social media statement\u00a0on Sunday afternoon that they had \"received incoming from individuals alleging to be victims and their lawyers, requesting that certain information be removed. Out of an abundance of caution, the material is temporarily removed for review and will be released again with appropriate redactions, if legally required.\"",
      "Blanche said earlier on Sunday in an interview on NBC News that the DOJ would be responsive to concerns raised by victims about potential exposure of identifying information and insisted, despite the slow release of materials, that DOJ is complying with the law.",
      "\"The statute also requires us to protect victims and\u2014and so the reason why we are still reviewing documents and still continuing our process is simply that to protect victims,\" he said. \"So the same individuals that are out there complaining about the lack of documents that were produced on Friday are the same individuals who apparently don't want us to protect victims.\u201d",
      "\"The reality is anybody, any victim, any victim\u2019s lawyers, any victim rights group, can reach out to us and say, 'Hey, Department of Justice, there\u2019s a document, there\u2019s a photo, there\u2019s something within the Epstein files that identifies me,'\" he added. \"And we will then, of course, pull that off and investigate.\"",

      "A 13-year-old girl at a Louisiana middle school got into a fight with classmates who were sharing AI-generated nude images of her",
      "THIBODAUX, La. -- The teasing was relentless. Nude images of a 13-year-old girl and her friends, generated by artificial intelligence, were circulating on social media and had become the talk of a Louisiana middle school.",
      "The girls begged for help, first from a school guidance counselor and then from a sheriff\u2019s deputy assigned to their school. But the images were shared on Snapchat, an app that deletes messages seconds after they\u2019re viewed, and the adults couldn\u2019t find them. The principal had doubts they even existed.",
      "Among the kids, the pictures were still spreading. When the 13-year-old girl stepped onto the Lafourche Parish school bus at the end of the day, a classmate was showing one of them to a friend.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s when I got angry,\u201d the eighth grader recalled at her discipline hearing.",
      "Fed up, she attacked a boy on the bus, inviting others to join her. She was kicked out of Sixth Ward Middle School for more than 10 weeks and sent to an alternative school. She said the boy whom she and her friends suspected of creating the images wasn\u2019t sent to that alternative school with her. The 13-year-old girl\u2019s attorneys allege he avoided school discipline altogether.",
      "When the sheriff's department looked into the case, they took the opposite actions. They charged two of the boys who'd been accused of sharing explicit images \u2014 and not the girl.",
      "The Louisiana episode highlights the nightmarish potential of AI deepfakes. They can, and do, upend children's lives \u2014 at school, and at home. And while schools are working to address artificial intelligence in classroom instruction, they often have done little to prepare for what the new tech means for cyberbullying and harassment.",
      "Once again, as kids increasingly use new tech to hurt one another, adults are behind the curve, said Sergio Alexander, a research associate at Texas Christian University focused on emerging technology.",
      "\u201cWhen we ignore the digital harm, the only moment that becomes visible is when the victim finally breaks,\u201d Alexander said.",
      "In Lafourche Parish, the school district followed all its protocols for reporting misconduct, Superintendent Jarod Martin said in a statement. He said a \u201cone-sided story\u201d had been presented of the case that fails to illustrate its \"totality and complex nature.\u201d",
      "After hearing rumors about the nude images, the 13-year-old said she marched with two friends \u2014 one nearly in tears \u2014 to the guidance counselor around 7 a.m. on Aug. 26. The Associated Press isn\u2019t naming her because she is a minor and because AP doesn\u2019t normally name victims of sexual crimes.",
      "She was there for moral support, not initially realizing there were images of her, too, according to testimony at her school disciplinary hearing.",
      "Ultimately, the weeks-long investigation at the school in Thibodaux, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) southwest of New Orleans, uncovered AI-generated nude images of eight female middle school students and two adults, the district and sheriff's office said in a joint statement.",
      "\u201cFull nudes with her face put on them\u201d is how the girl\u2019s father, Joseph Daniels, described them.",
      "Until recently, it took some technical skill to make realistic deepfakes. Technology now makes it easy to pluck a photo off social media, \u201cnudify\u201d it and create a viral nightmare for an unsuspecting classmate.",
      "Most schools are \u201cjust kind of burying their heads in the sand, hoping that this isn\u2019t happening,\u201d said Sameer Hinduja, co-director of the Cyberbullying Research Center and professor of criminology at Florida Atlantic University.",
      "Lafourche Parish School District was just starting to develop policies on artificial intelligence. The school-level AI guidance mainly addressed academics, according to documents provided through a records request. The district also hadn\u2019t updated its training on cyberbullying to reflect the threat of AI-generated, sexually explicit images. The curriculum its schools used was from 2018.",
      "Although the girls at Sixth Ward Middle School hadn\u2019t seen the images firsthand, they heard about them from boys at school. Based on those conversations, the girls accused a classmate and two students from other schools of creating and spreading the nudes on Snapchat and possibly TikTok.",
      "The principal, Danielle Coriell, said an investigation came up cold that day as no student took responsibility. The deputy assigned to the school searched social media for the images unsuccessfully, according to a recording of the disciplinary hearing.",
      "\u201cI was led to believe that this was just hearsay and rumors,\u201d the girl\u2019s father said, recounting a conversation he had that morning with the school counselor.",
      "But the girl was miserable, and a police incident report showed more girls were reporting that they were victims, too. The 13-year-old returned to the counselor in the afternoon, asking to call her father. She said she was refused.",
      "Her father says she sent a text message that said, \u201cDad,\u201d and nothing else. They didn't talk. With the mocking unrelenting, the girl texted her sister, \u201cIt\u2019s not getting handled.\u201d",
      "As the school day wound down, the principal was skeptical. At the disciplinary hearing, the girl\u2019s attorney asked why the sheriff's deputy didn\u2019t check the phone of the boy the girls were accusing and why he was allowed on the same bus as the girl.",
      "\u201cKids lie a lot,\u201d responded Coriell, the principal. \u201cThey lie about all kinds of things. They blow lots of things out of proportion on a daily basis. In 17 years, they do it all the time. So to my knowledge, at 2 o\u2019clock when I checked again, there were no pictures.\u201d",
      "When the girl stepped onto the bus 15 minutes later, the boy was showing the AI-generated images to a friend. Fake nude images of her friends were visible on the boy\u2019s phone, the girl said, a claim backed up by a photo taken on the bus. A video from the school bus showed at least a half-dozen students circulating the images, said Martin, the superintendent, at a school board meeting.",

      "Video of the fight was posted on Facebook. \u201cOverwhelming social media sentiment was one of outrage and a demand that the students involved in the fight be held accountable,\u201d the district and sheriff\u2019s office said in their joint statement released in November.",

      "It was on the day of the girl\u2019s disciplinary hearing, three weeks after the fight, that the first of the boys was charged.",
      "The student was charged with 10 counts of unlawful dissemination of images created by artificial intelligence under a new Louisiana state law, part of a wave of such legislation around the country. A second boy was charged in December with identical charges, the sheriff's department said. Neither was identified by authorities because of their ages.",
      "The girl would face no charges because of what the sheriff\u2019s office described as the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d",
      "At the disciplinary hearing, the principal refused to answer questions from the girl\u2019s attorneys about what kind of school discipline the boy would face.",
      "The district said in a statement that federal student privacy laws prohibit it from discussing individual students\u2019 disciplinary records. Gregory Miller, an attorney for the girl, said he has no knowledge of any school discipline for the classmate accused of sharing the images.",
      "Ultimately, the panel expelled the 13-year-old. She wept, her father said.",
      "\u201cShe just felt like she was victimized multiple times \u2014 by the pictures and by the school not believing her and by them putting her on a bus and then expelling her for her actions,\u201d he said in an interview.",
      "After she was sent to the alternative school, the girl started skipping meals, her father said. Unable to concentrate, she completed none of the school's online work for several days before her father got her into therapy for depression and anxiety.",
      "Nobody initially noticed when she stopped doing her assignments, her father said.",
      "\u201cShe kind of got left behind,\u201d he said.",
      "Her attorneys appealed to the school board, and another hearing was scheduled for seven weeks later.",
      "By then, so much time had passed that she could have returned to her old school on probation. But because she\u2019d missed assignments before getting treated for depression, the district wanted her to remain at the alternative site another 12 weeks.",
      "For students who are suspended or expelled, the impact can last years. They're more likely to be suspended again.

      "Xinis\u2019 Dec. 11 order that Abrego Garcia be released from immigration custody also concluded that the immigration judge who heard his case in 2019 had failed to issue an order of removal from the U.S., and he cannot be deported anywhere without a removal order.",
      "Abrego Garcia has an American wife and child and has lived in Maryland for years, but he immigrated to the U.S. illegally from El Salvador as a teenager. In 2019, an immigration judge granted him protection from being deported back to his home country, finding he faced danger there from a gang that had targeted his family. In March, he was mistakenly deported there anyway. U.S. officials resisted calls to bring him back until the Supreme Court weighed in. However, officials have said he cannot stay in the U.S. and have vowed to deport him to a third country.",
      "In filings last week, government attorneys argued that, with or without a final order of removal, they are still working to deport Abrego Garcia, so they can legally detain him during the process.",

      "Panic erupts in the McCallister household as soon as the day begins. The parents' alarm clock never rings, bags and coats spill across the floor, and the family barrels out the door to catch a flight to Florida.",
      "The pandemonium intensifies at the airport. There, the McCallisters must dodge fellow holiday travelers and luggage as they sprint to their gate while final boarding calls echo overhead. Amid the mayhem, 10-year-old Kevin accidentally boards the wrong plane and finds himself alone in New York City just days before Christmas.",
      "More than 30 years after \u201cHome Alone\u201d turned travel chaos into comedy, the frantic opening scenes of the movie's 1992 sequel still hit close to home, especially as the busy year-end travel period gets underway. But would Kevin McCallister still end up \u201cLost in New York\u201d in 2025?",
      "In an age of federal airport security checkpoints and digitized air travel, the fictional character played by Macaulay Culkin almost certainly wouldn't have gotten onto a commercial airliner by himself, said Sheldon Jacobson, who studies air travel operations and security and whose research contributed to the design of TSA PreCheck.",
      "\u201cIn the 1990s, it was plausible,\" Sheldon said. \u201cIt was close enough to plausible that people weren\u2019t rolling their eyes at it, but this would not happen today.\u201d",
      "The Sept. 11, 2001, attacks fundamentally changed how Americans move through airports, ushering the creation of the Transportation Security Administration, government-run security screenings, mandatory ID checks and restricted gate access. Before 9/11, travelers could head straight to their plane with little more than a paper ticket. Now, every passenger and bag is screened, names are checked against flight manifests and access beyond security checkpoints is tightly controlled.",
      "Even the paper tickets that made Kevin's mix-up possible are largely a thing of the past. In the film, Kevin frantically trails a man wearing a coat like his father's to the wrong gate at Chicago O'Hare International Airport, then crashes into an airline agent, sending both his ticket and a stack of boarding passes fluttering to the floor. Kevin explains that his family is already on the plane and he doesn't want to get left behind.",
      "\u201cDo you have a boarding pass?\u201d the agent asks. Kevin gestures to the pile of paper tickets and is ultimately allowed onto the plane.",
      "Today, boarding passes are tied to specific passengers, often stored on smartphones and scanned at the gate to confirm travelers are on the correct flight. The stricter unaccompanied minor policies and fees of airlines would add yet another layer of protection today, Jacobson said.",
      "In the movie, the gate agent walks Kevin down the jet bridge and asks if he spots his family onboard. Kevin points to the stranger he\u2019s mistaken for his father. The agent waves him on, tells him to grab an empty seat and that's that.",
      "Unaccompanied minors are closely tracked today. Most carriers require children under a certain age, often 14 or younger, to be formally registered as unaccompanied minors if they aren't traveling with an adult, Jacobson said. That comes with special paperwork and airline staff members who are assigned to escort a child through the airport, to their seat on the plane and off the plane at their destination.",
      "The Biden administration proposed a rule last year to ban airlines from charging families additional fees to sit together on flights and requiring them to seat children ages 13 and under next to an accompanying adult when adjacent seating is available at booking. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said earlier this month he had no update on the proposal.",

The jury found her not guilty of a misdemeanor concealment charge. No sentencing date had been set as of Friday morning. She could be sentenced to a maximum five years in prison.",

      "The Department of Justice has published thousands of its files related to Jeffrey Epstein",
      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. Department of Justice on Friday published thousands of files related to Jeffrey Epstein, a release long anticipated for its potential to reveal new details about the late sex offender and his connections to powerful people.",
      "But it was clear soon after the release that it would fall far short of those expectations. The partial release angered Democrats who accused the Trump administration of trying to hide information. The Justice Department said it would continue releasing documents in the weeks ahead.",
      "The file dump \u2014 dominated by photographs, but also including call logs, court records and other documents, many with redactions \u2014 comes after politicians and the public waged a massive campaign for transparency about the government's investigations into the wealthy financier.",
      "President Donald Trump, who was friends with Epstein for years before the two had a falling-out, tried for months to keep the records sealed. Though he hasn\u2019t been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, he has argued there is nothing to see in the files and the public should focus on other issues.",
      "On Nov. 19, relenting to political pressure from his fellow Republicans, he signed a bill mandating the release of most of the Justice Department\u2019s files on Epstein within 30 days. The White House said Friday\u2019s release of the files shows how the administration is the \u201cmost transparent in history.\u201d",
      "Here are some takeaways about the Justice Department's initial Epstein file release:",
      "The law signed by Trump last month set Friday as the deadline for the Justice Department to release most of its files about Epstein.",
      "Ahead of the release, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told Fox News he expected several hundred thousand files to be released Friday, along with several hundred thousand more to come later.",
      "But the number of files that actually landed on the Justice Department's website seemed to be a thin slice of the total number expected. Blanche acknowledged in a letter to Congress that the production of files was incomplete. The department said it expected to complete its production of Epstein documents by the end of the year.",
      "Among the documents made public are around 4,000 files \u2014 mostly photographs \u2014 under a subset the Justice Department described as \u201cDOJ Disclosures.\" The vast majority of the photographs were taken by the FBI during searches of Epstein\u2019s homes in New York City and the U.S. Virgin Islands.",
      "Also included were images of envelopes, folders and boxes containing investigative materials from various probes related to Epstein. Many records are redacted and anything containing a victim\u2019s personally identifiable information, including materials depicting sexual and physical abuse, isn\u2019t authorized for release.",
      "Various other files released by the Justice Department on Friday include court records, public records and disclosures to House committees. At least some of that material has already circulated in the public domain after years of court action and investigations.",
      "Many of the most discussed photos from the files show the former Democratic president. Clinton has acknowledged that he traveled on Epstein's private jet but said through a spokesperson that he had no knowledge of the late financier's crimes.",
      "Some of the photos show Clinton on a private plane, including one with a woman seated next to him with her arm around him. Her face is redacted from the photo.",
      "Another photo shows him in a pool with British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, who has been convicted of luring young girls to Epstein so he could molest them, and with another person whose face is redacted.

      "If Democratic lawmakers so choose, they could go to court to force the Justice Department to comply with the law, but that would almost certainly be a lengthy process that plays out while the department releases more files.",
      "Separately, the House Oversight Committee has issued a subpoena for the Epstein files. That could give Congress another avenue to force the release of more information to the committee, but it would require Republicans to join them in contempt-of-Congress proceedings against a Republican administration.",

      "A rock covered with petroglyphs created centuries ago by the ancestors of the Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation is back home in the mountains of Utah",
      "TREMONTON, Utah -- A large rock bearing petroglyphs created more than 1,000 years ago by the ancestors of the Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation is finally back home in the mountains of northern Utah.",
      "The repatriation effort, which began in 2011, culminated earlier this month when the sacred rock was airlifted to its original location after being freed from a concrete slab in front of a church meetinghouse in the community of Tremonton, about 80 miles (129 kilometers) north of Salt Lake City.",
      "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints said in a statement Wednesday that historians and conservators working on its behalf partnered with the tribe and the state to carefully remove and clean the 2,500-pound (1,134-kilogram) rock. The process involved saws, chisels and eventually soap and water to remove years of lichen growth from the petroglyphs.",
      "For Brad Parry, the tribe\u2019s vice chair, it was emotional seeing the rock returned to the rugged hillside to rejoin other petroglyph-covered rocks. He said it's a spiritual place where Shoshone ancestors would gather to camp and hunt.",
      "Parry said the repatriation was like putting a puzzle piece in place.",
      "\u201cOur history is so fractured with a lot of things that happened to us,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cTo have these positive things now that are coming out \u2014 it\u2019s rebuilding our history. And I can\u2019t overstate that.\u201d",
      "People give different versions of how the rock found its way to the church meetinghouse some 80 years ago. Stories involve a group of people muscling the hefty rock into a pickup and hauling it to town.",
      "It's a mystery why it was brought to the church, said Ryan Saltzgiver, history sites curator for the Church History Department. For decades, it sat outside the building, first near the flagpole and then on the north side. Grainy black and white photos shared by the church showed the rock on display.",
      "David Bolingbroke, research and outreach historian for the Church History Department, said the rock was likely placed at the chapel not out of malice, but out of a lack of proper understanding.",

Saltzgiver said the church has a moral and ethical obligation to care for things that are in its possession as well as a responsibility to return sacred items to their rightful owners.",

      "Sgt. Quornelius Radford, 28, is scheduled to appear in a courtroom at Fort Stewart a week after Army prosecutors referred his case to a general court-martial, which handles cases involving the most serious crimes under military law.",
      "Officials say Radford opened fire with a personal handgun Aug. 6 on members of his supply unit at Fort Stewart in southeast Georgia, injuring four soldiers and a civilian worker who was Radford's romantic partner, before fellow soldiers were able to disarm and restrain him until military police arrived. The Army initially said all five victims were soldiers.",
      "A week after the shootings, Army prosecutors charged Radford with six counts of attempted murder and assault, with the sixth victim being a person the shooter fired at and missed. They also charged him with domestic violence. That charge was added because the injured civilian worker was Radford's \u201cintimate partner,\u201d Michelle McCaskill, a spokesperson for the Army prosecutors\u2019 office, told The Associated Press.",
      "The Army has not released the victims\u2019 names and Fort Stewart officials have declined to comment on what led to the shooting.",

      "Luigi Mangione\u2019s lawyers contend that Attorney General Pam Bondi\u2019s decision to seek the death penalty against him in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was tainted by her prior work as a lobbyist at a firm that represented the insurer\u2019s...",
      "NEW YORK -- Luigi Mangione\u2019s lawyers contend that Attorney General Pam Bondi\u2019s decision to seek the death penalty against him in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was tainted by her prior work as a lobbyist at a firm that represented the insurer\u2019s parent company.",
      "Bondi was a partner at Ballard Partners before leading the Justice Department\u2019s charge to turn Mangione\u2019s federal prosecution into a capital case, creating a \u201cprofound conflict of interest\u201d that violated his due process rights, his lawyers wrote in a court filing late Friday. They want prosecutors barred from seeking the death penalty and some charges thrown out. A hearing is scheduled for Jan. 9.",
      "By involving herself in the death penalty decision and making public statements suggesting that Mangione deserves execution, Bondi broke a vow she made before taking office in February that she would follow ethical regulations and bow out of matters pertaining to Ballard clients for a year, Mangione\u2019s lawyers said.",
      "They argued Bondi has continued to profit from her work for Ballard \u2014 and, indirectly, from its work for UnitedHealth Group \u2014 through a profit-sharing arrangement with the lobbying firm and a defined contribution plan it administers.",
      "The \u201cvery person\u201d empowered to seek Mangione\u2019s death \"has a financial stake in the case she is prosecuting,\u201d his lawyers wrote. Her conflict of interest \u201cshould have caused her to recuse herself from making any decisions on this case,\u201d they added.",
      "Messages seeking comment were left for the Justice Department and Ballard Partners.",
      "Bondi announced in April that she was directing Manhattan federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty, declaring even before Mangione was formally indicted that capital punishment was warranted for a \u201cpremeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America.\u201d",
      "Thompson, 50, was killed Dec. 4, 2024, as he walked to a Manhattan hotel for UnitedHealth Group\u2019s annual investor conference. Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting him from behind. Police say \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d were written on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase used to describe how insurers avoid paying claims.",
      "Mangione, 27, the Ivy League-educated scion of a wealthy Maryland family, was arrested five days later at a McDonald\u2019s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, about 230 miles (about 370 kilometers) west of Manhattan. He has pleaded not guilty to federal and state murder charges. The state charges carry the possibility of life in prison. Neither trial has been scheduled.",
      "Friday\u2019s filing put the focus back on Mangione\u2019s federal case a day after a marathon pretrial hearing ended in his fight to bar prosecutors in his state case from using certain evidence found during his arrest, such as a gun that police said matched the one used to kill Thompson and a notebook in which he purportedly described his intent to \u201cwack\u201d a health insurance executive. A ruling isn't expected until May.",
      "Mangione\u2019s defense team, led by the husband-and-wife duo of Karen Friedman-Agnifilo and Marc Agnifilo, zeroed in on Bondi\u2019s past lobbying work as they seek to convince U.S. District Judge Margaret Garnett to rule out capital punishment, throw out some charges and exclude the same evidence they want suppressed from the state case.",

      "Bondi\u2019s statements and other official actions \u2014 including a highly choreographed perp walk that saw Mangione led up a Manhattan pier by armed officers, and the Trump administration\u2019s flouting of established death penalty procedures \u2014 \u201chave violated Mr. Mangione\u2019s constitutional and statutory rights and have fatally prejudiced this death penalty case,\u201d his lawyers said.",
      "In a court filing last month, federal prosecutors argued that \u201cpretrial publicity, even when intense, is not itself a constitutional defect.\u201d",
      "Rather than dismissing the case outright or barring the government from seeking the death penalty, prosecutors argued, the defense\u2019s concerns can best be alleviated by carefully questioning prospective jurors about their knowledge of the case and ensuring Mangione\u2019s rights are respected at trial.",
      "\u201cWhat the defendant recasts as a constitutional crisis is merely a repackaging of arguments\u201d rejected in previous cases, prosecutors said. \u201cNone warrants dismissal of the indictment or categorical preclusion of a congressionally authorized punishment.\u201d",
      "Mangione\u2019s lawyers said they want to investigate Bondi\u2019s ties to Ballard and the firm\u2019s relationship with UnitedHealth Group and will ask for various materials, including details of Bondi\u2019s compensation from the firm, any direction she's given Justice Department employees regarding the case or UnitedHealthcare, and sworn testimony from \u201call individuals with personal knowledge of the relevant matters.\"",

      "He's perhaps best known for his breakout role at age 23 as Archie Bunker's liberal son-in-law, Michael \"Meathead\" Stivic in the hit 1970s sitcom \"All in the Family,\" though others may know him more recently as Bob Day, the father of the quirky Jess Day in \"New Girl.\" Reiner also directed iconic films such as \"The Princess Bride,\" \"When Harry Met Sally\u2026,\" \"This is Spinal Tap,\" \"Stand By Me\" and \"A Few Good Men.\"",

      "Albert Brooks said he's still in disbelief over the death of his good friend, who he's known since the pair attended drama class together at Beverly Hills High School more than 60 years ago. He said he was heartbroken, but he loves to talk about his friendship with Reiner because it's \"genuine and it's rare.\"",
      "\"Rob was my oldest friend. It's that simple. He's the person that I've known the longest. I met him when I was 14 years old. So I'm still in that not believing it stage,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Brooks said he still finds himself dialing his pal's number to chat, and then freezes when he realizes what he's done.",

      "\"If I hadn't done 'Misery,' it would be like George Bailey going back and seeing what his life would have been like if he had never been there,\" she said. \"I wouldn't have had some of the friends that I have now. I wouldn't have had the richness in my life. I quite frankly probably would have stayed in the theater and I doubt I would have had a movie career. I might have dropped out altogether.\"",
      "She recalled Reiner's enthusiasm when she walked on stage to accept her Oscar for Best Actress in 1991.",
      "\"When they called my name, I looked over and Rob was standing and he was just pounding his fist together going, 'Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!'\" she recalled.",
      "Kiefer Sutherland",
      "Kiefer Sutherland who played Lt. Jonathan Kendrick in the 1992 legal drama \"A Few Good Men\" said Reiner had an unforgettable presence on set as director. He recalled the tense courtroom scene where Jack Nicholson \u2013 Colonel Nathan Jessup \u2013 had to deliver his now famous line, \"You can't handle the truth!\"",
      "After the first moving take, Sutherland recalled Reiner asking Nicholson if he wanted to go again.",
      "\"No one said a word, and Rob went up to Jack Nicholson and whispered in his ear, 'Do you want to do another one?' And Jack Nicholson said, 'Well, we're here,'\" Sutherland recalled. \"So they did another one, and it was just as extraordinary.\"",
      "The actors planned a marathon filming day, but Sutherland said Reiner was so blown away by Nicholson's performance that day that he sent everyone home early.",
      "\"They had planned to shoot the whole day, and Rob looked at everybody and said, 'I couldn't ask for anything more, so you guys all have the rest of the day off,\" Sutherland said.",
      "Annette Bening",
      "Annette Bening played Sydney Ellen Wade, an environmental lobbyist and love interest of widower President Andrew Shepherd, portrayed by Michael Douglas in the 1995 political romantic comedy, \"The American President.\" During filming, Bening said Reiner made it a priority as the movie's director to ensure the cast and crew could spend quality time with their families.",
      "\"On the set, he had that kind of enthusiasm that is infectious. The leader sets the tone, right? So he was wonderful that way. And a real avid family man,\" Bening said.",

      "Michael Douglas",
      "Like Reiner, Michael Douglas was also born to Hollywood royalty, the son of Kirk Douglas.",

Once you go into the same business, it stares you in the face,\" Douglas said. \"And, in Rob's case, are you as funny as your father?

And I haven't been able to achieve that to this day, but I won't quit trying. He cared about my nature. He showed it to me over and over again,\" Patinkin said. \"I believe that we can connect with Rob and Michele.

    "story": [
      "Sean Ono Lennon has had a versatile career, as a musician, producer, and songwriter. Asked what part of the musical creation process he likes the most, Lennon replied, \"That's easy: I love writing and recording, and I hate finishing.\"",
      "With his mother, Yoko Ono, now in her 90s, he's added a new job: the custodian of his father's legacy. \"Yeah, technically,\" he said, \"but obviously the world is also the custodian of his legacy, I would say. I'm just doing my best to help make sure that the younger generation doesn't forget about The Beatles and John and Yoko. That's how I look at it.\"",
      "\"Do you think that's even possible?\" I asked.",
      "\"To forget about it? I do, actually,\" Lennon said. \"And I never did before.\"",
      "For his parents' classic, \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over),\" Lennon looked for new ways for the song to be heard. \"I wanted to see if I could get that feeling of maybe it sounds like you're hearing it again for the first time, or at least in a new context, in a way that you'd pay attention, as opposed to, 'Oh, there it is on the radio again.'\"",
      "Lennon collaborated with former Pixar animator Dave Mullins to make a short film, \"War Is Over!\" \"We came up with this idea that two soldiers would be playing chess on opposite sides of a war,\" Lennon said. \"I'd also read an article that there were sort of heroic messenger pigeons from World War I and World War II.\"",
      "The 11-minute film, now on YouTube, won an Academy Award last year for best animated short. \"It felt like a Miss Universe pageant or something,\" Lennon said, \"and I was just standing there kind of crying.\"",
      "He used the moment to shout-out his mom: \"So, could everyone please say, 'Happy Mother's Day, Yoko!'\"",
      "\"It's a personal thing\"",
      "Lennon said, \"My parents gave me so much that I think it's the least I can do to try and support their legacy in my lifetime. I feel like I just owe it to them. It's a personal thing.\"",
      "What does he see is their legacy? \"Peace and love,\" he said. \"But it's not just peace and love. It's an attitude towards activism that is done with humor and love.\"",
      "That attitude is visible in the new HBO documentary \"One to One,\" about John and Yoko's 1972 benefit concert at Madison Square Garden \u2013 the only concert John and Yoko had done together. \"The only full-length concert,\" Lennon said, \"certainly the only concert I think that he played a Beatles song, too (\"Come Together\"), because I think he was just in a good mood.\"",
      "To watch a trailer for \"One to One,\" click on the video player below:",
      "The concert occurred during Lennon's first years in New York, when he was fighting a bitter deportation battle with the Nixon administration, in part because of his anti-war activism.",
      "Featured in the film, said Lennon, were recordings he'd never heard: \"They found these phone calls that my parents had recorded of themselves which, interestingly, was a response to the FBI tapping their phones. So, they thought, 'Well, we need to tap our own phones. Because if they try to say we said something that we didn't say, we'll have our own record of it.'\"",
      "The documentary captures John and Yoko at a critical time in their lives. \"Yeah, and you know, it's my origin story actually,\" said Lennon. \"If you think about it, they came to New York, and that's the only reason I exist.\"",
      "I asked, \"Do you see something you maybe didn't see before? Or have you seen it all before?\"",
      "\"I hadn't seen all of the home video footage in 'One to One,'\" he said. \"I hadn't heard those phone recordings before. It's like getting more moments to spend with my dad. So actually, for me on a personal level, it just really means a lot.\"",
      "Sean produced the music (also released as a box set). He's working on his own new album, too, his third with the Claypool Lennon Delirium, which he describes as \"kind of a whimsical prog rock, experimental psych band. It's fun!\"",
      "The Claypool Lennon Delirium performs \"Blood and Rockets\":",
      "Lennon and James McCartney (Paul's son) have also been working on a new song with Zak Starkey (Ringo's son), kindling hopes that the \"Children of the Beatles\" might unite.",
      "Asked if they've been offered a gig to play together, Lennon replied, \"Sure. I think people ask for that a lot, but I do think that would be ridiculous. But you know, the reason Zak and James and I made a song together is not because we're trying to redo The Beatles, it's just because we like each other. We're not gonna do it because of some expectation or to, like, fulfill anyone's expectation of what we should do. It has to be natural.\"",
      "Sean Lennon takes his new responsibilities very seriously: \"I think the Beatles' music, and John and Yoko's legacy, is something important for the world to kind of cherish and be reminded of. So, that's how I see my job.\"",
      "Asked how his mother is doing, Lennon said, \"She's good. I mean, you know, she's 92, so she's slowed down a lot, and she's retired. That's why I'm kind of trying to do the work that she used to do. That's why I feel a lot of pressure, actually, to do my best, because she set a high standard for the way that she dealt with my dad's music, and the Beatles stuff. She's always been very singular. And I think my dad was less so. You know, he had Paul to write with, and then he was hoping that my mom would kind of be a writing partner. And I just think it's really funny that, you know, there's probably only one person in the world who would turn down John Lennon as a writing partner, and that's my mom, you know?\"",
      "\"That's probably why he liked her,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah, exactly. No, that's exactly right!\" Lennon laughed.",

      "\"A cappella\" means singing without instruments. But we've come a very long way from monks chanting, to Pentatonix, an a cappella quintet that's won three Grammys and sold 10 million albums. YouTube fans have played their videos more than six billion times.",
      "\"We've just blended together throughout the years just because of how long we've been together,\" said Kirstin Maldonado.",
      "And three of the singers\u2014Maldonado, Scott Hoying and Mitch Grassi\u2014have been together a very long time. \"Mitch and I were in a show together when we were ten,\" said Hoying. \"I met Kirsti in freshman English when we were 14!\"",
      "At their high school in Arlington, Texas, they formed a trio: a soprano, a baritone, and a countertenor. Grassi said of his voice, \"It is incredibly high, and it got made fun of a lot while I was growing up. Yeah, growing up in Texas, you know, it was very different and it's a little feminine, so it was like, 'Get him outta here.'\"",
      "Hoying said, \"Our different timbres make such a specific sound when the frequencies of our voices come together, like they all play such a vital role. When they're all together, it feels like this hug. It's really magical, actually.\"",
      "In 2011, they decided to try out for NBC's a cappella competition show \"The Sing-Off.\" But when they learned that bigger groups had better chances, they added a bass, Avi Kaplan, and wanted to add a beatboxer. Hoying said, \"And so, in an act of desperation, we literally went on YouTube and typed in 'beatboxers.' The first video to pop up was a video of Kevin playing cello and beatboxing at the same time.\"",
      "It was Kevin Olusola\u2014cellist, singer, beatboxer, and pre-med student at Yale. Asked what his parents had to say when he quit pre-med to become a musician, Olusola replied, \"It was definitely not the plan!\"",
      "They not only made it onto \"Sing-Off,\" they won the grand prize: $200,000 and a record deal. But within a month, the record company dropped them. Olusola said, \"They asked us, 'Hey, will you guys put any instrumentation behind what you all do?' And we said, 'We literally just won an a cappella TV show.'\"",
      "Hoying said, \"We were just like, 'No, we don't like that idea.' And they were like, 'Okay, then we'll drop you.'\"",
      "Instead, they turned to YouTube. Within a year, they had four million subscribers.",
      "\"The video that probably really broke us in terms of the industry would be 'Little Drummer Boy,'\" Olusola said. \"It went to Top 10 of iTunes for four weeks.\"",
      "The higher the Pentatonix star ascended, the harder they worked. Their behind-the-scenes sixth member, co-founder and producer Ben Bram, wrote ever-more spectacular vocal arrangements. Pentatonix released three albums in 2014 alone, and toured for nine months every year.",
      "\"You never got to recharge and be at home, or see your friends or your loved ones,\" said Maldonado. \"It was, like, really, really brutal.\"",
      "So brutal that, in 2017, Avi Kaplan made a stunning announcement: he decided to take a step back from Pentatonix.",
      "\"He didn't really want to tour; he didn't love the tour life,\" said Hoying. \"And we were in our prime and, like, really wanting to tour a lot.\"",
      "After a nationwide search, Pentatonix found its new bass: a Pentatonix superfan from Maryland named Matt Sallee. \"To be able to come into the group and to be able to continue its legacy was something that I cherish very deeply, and I took very seriously,\" Sallee said.",
      "He was prepared: \"I knew everything,\" he said. \"I, like, learned every song, every bass part of every song.\"",
      "\"We were so excited and relieved and grateful that, like, oh, we can see the vision for the future, we can keep this going\" Hoying said.",
      "And they did keep going.",
      "To hear Pentatonix perform \"O Holy Night\" click on the video player below:",
      "I asked, \"You guys have been together\u2014living, traveling, working\u2014for years. You can't tell me there aren't things about each of you that drive others of you crazy?\"",
      "\"Do we have time?\" Sallee replied.",
      "\"There's a lot. There's a lot,\" said Maldonado.",
      "Hoying said, \"We kind of lucked out that none of us are super-reactive.\"",
      "\"I don't think we all have, like, crazy egos that are, like, getting in the way of being able to communicate clearly with each other,\" Maldonado said.",

    "summary": "Turner Classic Movies host Ben Mankiewicz looks back at the work of actor and director Rob Reiner, whose films became part of our shared cinematic language because of their humor, drama, and aching belief in humanity.",
    "story": [
      "In the aftermath of the deaths last weekend of filmmaker Rob Reiner and his wife Michele, Turner Classic Movies host Ben Mankiewicz offers an appreciation of Reiner's unparalleled career and life in the movies:",
      "Rob Reiner entered America's collective consciousness in 1971, playing Mike Stivic, Archie Bunker's son-in-law, and politically liberal foil, on \"All in the Family.\"",
      "Mike: \"It's getting like politics in American is only for the rich.\" Archie: \"Who's been feeding you that commie crapola?\" Mike: \"President Eisenhower said that.\" Archie: \"He did not! Eisenhower was a great president who never said nothing.\"",
      "Even then, Reiner knew that, as good as he was in front of the camera, he wanted to direct. His feature debut as a director came in 1984 with \"This Is Spinal Tap,\" a parody of a documentary that delivered one of the funniest scenes in movie history:",
      "Nigel (Christopher Guest): \"This is very, very special. Because as you can see, the numbers all go to 11. Look, right across the board, 11, 11, 11, 11.\"  Marty: (Reiner): \"And most amps go up to 10?\"Nigel: \"Exactly. \u2026 What we do is, if we need that extra push over the cliff, you know what we do?\"Marty: \"Put it up to 11?\"Nigel: \"Exactly. One louder.\"Marty: \"Why don't you just make 10 louder, and make 10 be the top number, and make that a little louder?\"Pause.Nigel: \"These go to 11!\"",
      "\"Spinal Tap\" began an extraordinary run that rivals the best directors in Hollywood history: Seven classic films in just 11 years, each standing the test of time, each possessing some piece of authentic humanity.",
      "In \"Stand By Me,\" an aching moment of friendship between two boys.",
      "In \"The Princess Bride,\" a combination of everlasting love \u2026 and revenge.",
      "Inigo (Mandy Patinkin): \"My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\"",
      "Three of the movies Reiner made during that run of success contain scenes so perfectly shot, they've become part of our shared cinematic language. First came the diner scene in \"When Harry Met Sally.\" The scene required Meg Ryan to mimic a woman faking an orgasm. After one take, Reiner went to Ryan and explained what he wanted: louder, more hand movements, table pounding. The button on the scene came from Reiner's mother, Estelle: \"I'll have what she's having.\"",
      "Next came Kathy Bates, giving an Oscar-winning performance in \"Misery.\" For the hobbling scene, Reiner gives us James Caan's perspective, tied to the bed, looking up at the benevolent mania of Bates' face.",
      "Finally, in \"A Few Good Men,\" Reiner did the seemingly impossible: directing Jack Nicholson to a performance as memorable as \"Chinatown,\" \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\" or \"The Shining.\" Reiner gave us a courtroom drama for the ages, and Nicholson an opportunity to shine in front of a new generation of movie lovers.",
      "Col. Jessup (Jack Nicholson): \"You want answers.\" Lt. Kaffee (Tom Cruise): \"I think I'm entitled.\" Jessup: \"You want answers?\" Kaffee: \"I want the truth.\" Jessup: \"You can't handle the truth.\"",
      "The truth about Rob Reiner is that, for many Americans, his politics were as well-known as his films, but not always as popular. A fierce critic of President Trump, there's no doubt millions of Americans disagreed (many strongly) with Reiner.",
      "But here's the thing we can all understand about him: Rob Reiner was a patriot, an American who believed deeply in humanity; who believed in trying to make his country work as well as possible for as many human beings as possible.",
      "You can see that aspirational political nature in the last movie of his remarkable run, \"The American President,\" in 1995:",
      "President Shepherd (Michael Douglas): \"You want to claim this land is the land of the free? Then the symbol of your country cannot just be a flag. The symbol also has to be one of its citizens exercising his right to burn that flag in protest. Now show me that, defend that, celebrate that in your classrooms. Then you can stand up and sing about the land of the free.\"",
      "There is no easy way to process the family tragedy that took Rob and Michele Reiner. It is awful. Period.",
      "The sense of loss is heightened by Rob's lofty standing in Hollywood. In a business that can induce backstabbing and produce enemies, Rob was nearly universally loved in the entertainment industry. I didn't know him as well as I would've liked, but he always made me feel like we'd been pals for decades.",
      "His character was defined by his kindness, his humor, his compassion, by his own humanity.",
      "Those are qualities that all of us love in his movies, films that maybe, in some small way, can help us find something that unites us in these unbelievably fractured times.",

    "summary": "Ted Koppel visits Seneca Falls, the Central New York town that's said to have inspired the 1946 Jimmy Stewart classic \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" a film that celebrates smalltown virtues and happy endings, and which still has a powerful hold on our imagination.",
    "story": [
      "There's a little town in Central New York that our old colleague, Bill Geist visited 14 years ago, when he said, \"On Christmas morning, what better place to be than Seneca Falls, N.Y.? The town loudly and proudly proclaims that it was the inspiration for the Christmas film classic 'It's a Wonderful Life.'\"",
      "And every year they have this festival celebrating the occasion. One visitor told us, \"Been waiting my whole life to come up here and see this. I believed in Santa Claus when I was a kid. And I believed in the movie.\"",
      "The movie's been around for almost 80 years now, but just in case you don't know the plot: Jimmy Stewart plays George Bailey, this sweetheart of a guy who runs a building and loan association in the town of Bedford Falls, just the soul of decency and kindness and selflessness. And then there's Lionel Barrymore. He's Mr. Potter, who runs the big bank in town, and he is none of those things.",
      "MR. POTTER: \"Are you running a business or a charity ward? Not with my money!\"",
      "In a nutshell, we get to see what the town would have been like if George Bailey hadn't ever existed \u2013 instead of Bedford Falls, we had Pottersville.",
      "It might have been just a little like this: A few weeks back at a Seneca Falls Town Board meeting, a local resident kept talking after debate had been shut down, and a board member, Frank Sinicropi, seemed to offer a drastic solution: \"Shoot him!\"",
      "He was just kidding, but he did tell the police chief to shoot one of the townspeople. Bad timing! After all, this was just a few weeks before all those tourists come pouring into town searching for the annual festival celebrating \"It's a Wonderful Life.\"",
      "Kevin McDonald wasn't born when the movie was made, but he lives and breathes the film's message: \"Especially this time of year,\" he said. \"The spirit. You can't be here and not smile.\"",
      "It's on a bridge just like this one that director Frank Capra brings his hero, George Bailey, to the brink of suicide, until he witnesses someone fall into the water \u2013 an angel who, by keeping George from suicide and getting him to perform a heroic rescue, will earn his wings.",
      "Locals believe it's based on a real rescue in 1917 in Seneca Falls. \"Somebody tried to end their life here,\" said McDonald.",
      "Enter Antonio Varacalli, who was on the shoreline when he saw the woman go into the water, and jumped in to save her. \"Got her to shore, and then he succumbed,\" McDonald said. \"He was an immigrant from Italy. We have a hero's celebration in April to honor him.\"",
      "\"It's kind of ironic, isn't it, in these times with what's happening to immigrants?\" I said.",
      "\"It sure is.\"",
      "But when this reporter visited the local cafe and talked about immigrants today being rounded up and sent overseas, not necessarily back to their own countries, one woman replied, \"You poor thing. You're gonna have a hard time this weekend, because everyone I've met today is gonna focus on the positive.\"",
      "\"Well, that's fine,\" I said. \"I've got no problem with you focusing on the positive; I'm just not gonna make it that easy for you. You're focusing on the positive, and I'm seeing a country that is getting caught up in the negative. You can't ignore that.\"",
      "Another woman, wearing angel wings, said, \"When you come to Seneca Falls, you get it. It's healing, and it's hope. I think that's one of the reasons we're so drawn to this movie, just to give ourselves back to kindness again.\"",
      "It's an inescapable message, even for Jimmy Hawkins and Karolyn Grimes, who played two of the Bailey children, Tommy and Zuzu, in the movie.",
      "Grimes admitted she didn't have many lines in the movie, but people hold onto her most famous one at the end: \"Daddy, Teacher says every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings.\"",
      "\"Everywhere she goes, right?\" Hawkins said.",
      "What's more, Grimes said, \"I believe it.\"",
      "\"Oh, do you?\"",
      "\"Oh, I do!\"",
      "\"I'm sorry,\" I said.",
      "\"Are you a cynic?\" Grimes asked.",
      "\"A cynic?\" I replied. \"I don't think you can be in my line of work for as many years as I have been without becoming a bit of a cynic!\"",
      "Well, for example, amid all that joyful spirit of kindness and civility hanging over Seneca Falls at this time of year, there is also THAT just looming over the edge of town: Seneca Meadows, the largest landfill in the Northeastern United States.",
      "Bill Lutz has a plant that packages bottles and containers for wineries and breweries in the shadow of Seneca Meadows: \"That hill is filled with all kinds of garbage and toxic chemicals and vapors that come off it on a daily basis,\" he said. \"We have a hard time not only retaining employees, but attracting new employees. It's definitely a challenge to try to get people that want to move here. And it certainly affects our business.\"",
      "Not surprisingly, Seneca Meadows told us they are a good neighbor who consistently meets or exceeds safety standards and regulations. In fact, that's part of their argument for why they should be allowed to expand.",
      "Lutz said, \"It was flat land not too many years ago, and now they're moving to an expansion that would take it another 15 years, and another 70 feet higher.\"",
      "Now, isn't that just the kind of thing that would've driven Jimmy Stewart's character, George Bailey, nuts?",
      "GEORGE BAILEY: \"You spin your little web and think the whole world revolves around you and your money. Well, it doesn't, Mr. Potter!",
      "Lutz said, \"They've got plenty of money, lawyers to keep it going. It's a big Texas company, and they want to continue to grow it, because they can do it here, in a small town.\"",
      "In fact, that's what we have downtown: A small town, with a museum about a movie. Well, part of a movie \u2013 maybe not the part about what could happen to the town of Bedford Falls.",
      "\"People want to go back to simpler times,\" said Anwei Law, who created the \"It's a Wonderful Life\" Museum. \"This reminds them of that, and gives them the opportunity to do that for a short period of time.\"",
      "I asked Karolyn Grimes, \"What are we seeing today? Are we seeing a reflection of George Bailey's world? Or Mr. Potter's world?\"",
      "\"Oh, that's awfully touchy!\" she laughed. \"It's trying to be Mr. Potter's world, I think. But I think there's enough George Baileys out there that it's gonna balance their direction.\"",
      "Mr. Potter, a villain in the movie, seems to go unpunished, although Harold Buccholz, a student of the film, sees a greater message: \"We're a little bit surprised when George Bailey has his life back, and he's so excited to be alive again. And as he's running home he stops by the bank, he bangs on the window and says 'Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter!' His arch enemy! And I think if we choose to accept that that's ultimately Capra's challenge to us, is love your enemies, you will be richer, and the community will be richer if you can find a way to do that.\"",
      "It's a picture-perfect Hollywood ending that endures as a message to our better angels, even if reality doesn't always go that way.",
      "\"It depends if you believe,\" said the angel-winged fan of the film. \"We all have a calling.\"",
      "Anwei Law said, \"There's this need for people to come together. And there's this need for people to care about each other and help each other. And this movie prompts that in people because that's within them.\"",
      "\"It's a spotlight on what we could be, on what we can be?\" I said.",
      "\"Exactly. And we all really want to be.\"",
      "\"And want to be. Not necessarily what we are.\"",
      "\"What we are? Yep, yep,\" said Law.",
      "I'll settle for that!",

      "\"Rob was my oldest friend. It's that simple. He's the person that I've known the longest. I met him when I was 14 years old. So I'm still in that not believing it stage,\" he told CBS News in the special \"CBS News: Rob Reiner - Scenes from a Life,\" that aired Sunday. Brooks and Reiner met at Beverly Hills High School in a drama class 60 years ago.",

      "Brooks and Reiner returned to their high school, reminiscing about their time together while surveying the school's Wall of Fame, during an interview for \"CBS Sunday Morning\" in December 2023.",

    "summary": "To what does LEGO owe its remarkable half-century success story? CBS News visits the toy giant's Denmark headquarters to find out.",
    "story": [
      "Billund, Denmark - Millions of people around the world instantly recognize the look, the feel \u2014 especially under foot \u2014 and even the sound of LEGO. The plastic blocks have shaped childhood memories for generations.",
      "At the company's home in Denmark, decades of those experiences are captured inside a secret museum that only LEGO employees can access. CBS News, however, got a rare look inside that little-known museum, where it was possible to trace the evolution of one of the world's most recognizable and beloved toys.",
      "The museum sits next to the original home of LEGO's founder, Ole Kirk Kristiansen \u2014 a reminder of the toy giant's humble beginnings. The brand's name reflects its philosophy: \"LEGO\" comes from the Danish phrase \"leg godt,\" or \"play well.\"",
      "Inside the museum are some of the very first LEGO bricks, including pieces that date back to the 1950s. Among the earliest creations housed there is the first LEGO \"system\" that was ever assembled \u2014 a small town that laid the foundation for everything the company would go on to build.",
      "That system \u2014 the idea that every LEGO brick, regardless of when it was made, can connect \u2014 dates back to 1955, when the company assembled that first play town. Over the decades, LEGO creations have evolved from medieval villages to mind-blowing architectural feats.",
      "The collection features vintage sets that continue functioning as they were designed to, many decades later, including a working drawbridge castle from the 1970s. But there's been no shortage of evolution, either. From the early designs, LEGO's builds have grown increasingly ambitious and sophisticated.",
      "Along with the classics, the museum showcases intricate creations ranging from miniatures of iconic landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower to LEGO flower bouquets. Other pieces have evolved from LEGO's own sub-brands. Many of today's parents will be familiar, for instance, with armies of tiny characters from the modern kids' TV fantasy superhero show Ninjago.",
      "Inside Lego House",
      "CBS News also got a glimpse inside LEGO House, a nearly 130,000-square-foot monument to the toy, filled with some 25 million LEGO bricks, including those of the 6 million-plus that make up the striking \"Tree of Creativity.\"",
      "Standing nearly 50 feet high, it's the largest known LEGO build in the world. Each branch is packed with detail, a feast for the eyes.",
      "Behind all the creations is LEGO's own in-house army of creatives.",
      "\"There are about 700 designers here,\" Andr\u00e9 Doxey, the LEGO Group's first American Head of Design, told CBS News.",
      "Doxey said creativity, not technical skill, has been key to LEGO's enduring appeal.",
      "\"You don't have to be a designer,\" he said. \"You just have to be brave, creative and curious, and give it a try.\"",
      "Doxey believes LEGO's remarkable enduring popularity is owed largely to the freedom it offers.",
      "\"We know people love to create, kids love to create,\" he said. \"Our system is a creative medium. It enables them to imagine anything they want to imagine.\"",
      "LEGO: Not just for the kids \u2014 but mainly for the kids",
      "And LEGO has found that the appeal extends well beyond childhood. Nostalgia plays a powerful role at the company, and so-called AFOLs \u2014 Adult Fans of LEGO \u2014 represent a significant and growing market.",
      "But Design Master Milan Madge knows the audience well, and while not denying the rising popularity of more complex, grown-up builds, he said children remain the company's priority.",
      "\"They're our first inspiration,\" he said. \"We try to act like children and see the world through their eyes.\"",
      "While modern designs are often created digitally to streamline production, Madge said he still prefers working with physical bricks.",
      "\"There's a real connection between the mind and the creative process when you're doing hands-on work,\" he said.",
      "That simple tactile connection \u2014 brick by brick \u2014 has helped make LEGO the top-grossing toy company in the world. Families build together. Friends gather around shared creations. Communities form, united by the sound of bricks rattling in a box.",
      "\"Everyone knows that sound,\" Doxey told CBS News. \"You shake it, and you know exactly what it is.\"",
      "A beloved toy, with a plastic problem",
      "Beyond all the creativity and the nostalgia, however, the LEGO Group is also grappling with a fundamental issue in a world facing what a majority of scientists say is a climate crisis: The company's empire is still built almost entirely on plastic, and one of the key components in most plastic is fossil fuel.",
      "Every ton of LEGO produced requires about two tons of petrochemicals in the manufacturing process, according to the global sustainability information and data platform, illuminem. LEGO makes approximately 60 billion bricks per year, and based on illuminem's data, some of the company's largest sets would require the equivalent of over 60 pounds of petrochemical equivalent to produce.",
      "Despite ambitious climate pledges, the company has so far failed to find a sustainable path for its toys.",
      "LEGO abandoned a \"bottles to bricks\" initiative in 2023 after finding the proposed recyclable material it hoped to use would, in fact, increase emissions compared to its current materials.",
      "\"LEGO bricks are made for children, so they must meet extremely high quality and safety standards,\" the company told CBS News in a statement. \"They must also be durable, and are precision-engineered to accuracy of less than a hair's width so that a brick made today still fits one made 60 years ago.\"",
      "The company said it has tested more than 600 different materials for its LEGO bricks, including some derived from \"sustainable-sourced sugarcane\" and recycled materials from artificial marble kitchen countertops.",
      "\"Other materials have shown potential, but have not met our strict quality, safety and durability requirements, or would not have helped reduce our carbon footprint,\" the statement said, adding that the company is on track for \"60% of the materials we buy to be produced from sustainable sources\" by the end of the year.",
      "Even after all these years, LEGO continues to evolve.",

    "story": [
      "Tennessee's governor pardoned country star Jelly Roll on Thursday for his criminal past in the state, acknowledging the Nashville native's long road back from drugs and prison through soul-searching, songwriting and advocacy for second chances.",
      "The rapper-turned-singer, whose legal name is Jason Deford, has spoken for years about his redemption arc before diverse audiences, from people serving time in correctional centers to concert crowds and even in testimony before Congress.",
      "Republican Gov. Bill Lee issued his pardon after friends and civic leaders of the Grammy-nominated musician joined in an outpouring of support.",
      "He has said a pardon would make it easier for him to travel internationally for concert tours and to perform Christian missionary work without requiring burdensome paperwork.",
      "He was one of 33 people to receive pardons Thursday from Lee, who for years has issued clemency decisions around the Christmas season. Lee said Jelly Roll's application underwent the same monthslong thorough review as other applicants. The state parole board gave a nonbinding, unanimous recommendation for Jelly Roll's pardon in April.",
      "\"His story is remarkable, and it's a redemptive, powerful story, which is what you look for and what you hope for,\" Lee told reporters, adding he hopes to meet Jelly Roll for the first time soon.",
      "Beginning at the age of 14, Jelly Roll was in and out of jail for about a decade for convictions including aggravated robbery, shoplifting, drug possession and drug dealing.",
      "In January 2024, \"CBS Sunday Morning\" interviewed Jelly Roll inside the Metro-Davidson County Detention Facility in Nashville, where he had once been an inmate. At the time, Jelly Roll had just been nominated for two Grammys.",
      "\"There was a time in my life where I truly thought \u2026 this was it,\" he told \"CBS Sunday Morning.\" \"And then coming here, you know, just after getting nominated for two Grammys, it just hits different\u2026I didn't think I'd get emotional, to be honest.",
      "He told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" he wrote hundreds of songs while in jail.",
      "Unlike recent high-profile federal pardons, which let people off the hook for prison, a pardon in Tennessee serves as a statement of forgiveness for someone who has already completed a prison sentence and been released. Pardons offer a path to get certain civil rights restored, such as the right to vote, although there are some limitations under state law, and the governor can specify the terms.",
      "Jelly Roll broke into country music with the 2023 album \"Whitsitt Chapel\" and crossover songs like \"Need a Favor.\" He has won multiple CMT Awards, a CMA Award and also picked up seven career Grammy nominations, three of them recently.",
      "Much of his work has become associated with overcoming adversity, like the song \"Winning Streak\" that tells the story of someone's first day sober. Or the direct-and-to-the-point, \"I Am Not Okay.\"",
      "In making his case to the parole board, Jelly Roll said he first fell in love with songwriting while in custody, stating it began as a therapeutic passion project that \"would end up changing my life in ways that I never dreamed imaginable.\"",
      "Beyond his sold-out shows, he's brought his story to the Senate, where he testified in January 2024 about the dangers of fentanyl, describing his drug-dealing younger self as \"the uneducated man in the kitchen playing chemist with drugs I knew absolutely nothing about.\"",
      "\"I was a part of the problem,\" he told lawmakers at the time. \"I am here now standing as a man that wants to be a part of the solution.\"",
      "Jelly Roll's most serious convictions include a robbery at age 17 and drug charges at 23. In the first case, a female acquaintance helped Jelly Roll and two armed accomplices steal $350 from people in a home in 2002. Because the victims knew the female acquaintance, she and Jelly Roll were arrested right away. Jelly Roll was unarmed, and was sentenced to one year in prison plus probation.",
      "In another run-in 2008, police found marijuana and crack cocaine in his car, leading to eight years of court-ordered supervision.",
      "Friends and civic leaders backed the pardon application, citing Jelly Roll's transformation.",
      "Davidson County Sheriff Daron Hall, who runs Nashville's jail, wrote that Jelly Roll had an awakening in one of the jails he managed. Live Nation Entertainment CEO and President Michael Rapino cited Jelly Roll's donations from his performances to charities for at-risk youth.",
      "The parole board began considering Jelly Roll's pardon application in October 2024, which marks the state's five-year timeline for eligibility after his sentence expired. Prominent Nashville attorney David Raybin represents Jelly Roll in the pardon case.",
      "Lee's office said no one was pardoned Thursday who had a homicide or a sex-related conviction, or for any crime committed as an adult against a minor.",

    "story": [
      "Millions of Americans are bracing for higher health costs in 2026, as subsidies that help them pay for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act are set to expire on December 31.",
      "Experts warn\u00a0that a failure in Congress to extend the tax credits could be financially devastating for individual policyholders, while also raising health care costs as a whole. Roughly 22 million Americans receive the ACA subsidies, which were created in 2021 to lower households' monthly premiums.",
      "New\u00a0data from investment adviser SmartAsset projects how much people around the U.S. with an ACA plan would have paid on average for coverage in 2025 if they hadn't received the enhanced subsidies. As the analysis shows, monthly premiums for the government health insurance would've been hundreds of dollars higher.",
      "In Mississippi, where around 11% of residents are enrolled in an ACA plan, participants would have seen their average monthly premiums jump from $41 to $605, a 1,376% increase, SmartAsset found. In West Virginia, enrollees' premiums would have risen an average of 1,058%.",
      "A spokesperson for SmartAsset said the analysis captures 2025 costs, but noted the data amounts to a \"close approximation\" of how much more people with ACA coverage could expect to pay next year without the tax credits.",
      "SmartAsset used public records from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' 2025 Marketplace Open Enrollment Period to calculate the average cost of ACA plans.",
      "The exact price hikes people could see next will depend on a range of factors, including their insurance plan, age, household income, health status and where they live, according to a spokesperson from KFF. The health policy group estimates that annual out-of-pocket premium costs will increase 114% on average for the 22 million ACA enrollees who rely on the subsidies.",
      "What is the status of the ACA tax credits?",
      "The tax credits are set to lapse at the end of the year. Democratic lawmakers have pushed for an extension\u00a0but lack enough support in the Republican-led Congress. And while the House passed a health care bill this week that includes several policies favored by Republicans, it excludes an extension of the tax credits and faces hurdles in the Senate.",
      "Both chambers of Congress have left Washington until early next year, making it all but certain that the tax credits will expire on December 31. But four GOP members this week signed a Democratic measure to force a vote on extending the subsidies for three years, teeing up a final vote early next year.",
      "If Congress fails to solve the tax credit issue, some enrollees will qualify for a smaller subsidy, while others could lose eligibility completely, according to KFF.",
      "With sharply higher ACA costs on the horizon, the Congressional Budget Office estimates\u00a0that about 4 million people could drop their health insurance altogether. Experts say that could lead to higher costs for people with other types of health insurance because hospitals will have\u00a0to provide more uncompensated care for those lacking coverage.",

      "Called \"clutter,\" this radar interference can make it difficult to identify legitimate moving targets, Interior noted.",
      "The action comes two weeks after a federal judge struck down President Trump's executive order blocking wind energy projects, saying the effort to halt virtually all leasing of wind farms on federal lands and waters was \"arbitrary and capricious\" and violates U.S. law.",
      "Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts vacated Trump's Jan. 20\u00a0executive order\u00a0blocking wind energy projects and declared it unlawful.",

About half of those turbines were operational in October, the Vineyard Times reported that month.",
      "Once fully developed, the project is projected to generate renewable energy for more than 400,000 homes and businesses in Massachusetts. Vineyard Wind didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Revolution Wind, a project located off the coast of Rhode Island, is 80% completed, according to its website. It's operated by renewable energy company Orsted, which didn't immediately return a request for comment.",

      "Jim Beam, which is owned by a U.S. subsidiary of Japan's Suntory Holdings, said in an email to CBS News that its distillery in Clermont, Kentucky, will temporarily halt production \"while we take the opportunity to invest in site enhancements.\" The company plans to keep its James B.

    "story": [
      "In a TikTok video, then-17-year-old actor Symonne Harrison unveils a bathroom counter full of products from the skincare brand Drunk Elephant that would retail for at least $700 total.",
      "\"Guys, I just got the biggest package from them,\" Harrison tells her 3.8 million followers, adding that she's new to the brand's \"family.\" \"I know Drunk Elephant is known for mixing, doing little potion vibes.\"",
      "Those \"potions\" are so-called \"skincare smoothies,\" popular on social media and marketed by the brand, which suggests trios of products to mix together as part of a skincare regimen. They've become a blueprint for some of Generation Alpha's favorite \"get ready with me\" videos as skincare products and adult influencers who promote them have become increasingly trendy among tweens.",
      "But like in Harrison's video \u2014 which features an eye cream containing vitamin C that Drunk Elephant recommends those 12 and under avoid \u2014 many of those social media posts advertise products not suitable for such young skin. (Harrison did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.)",
      "CBS News Confirmed analyzed more than a dozen popular TikTok accounts featuring skincare-obsessed teens and tweens and found that many featured products with anti-aging ingredients that, according to dermatologists, can be harmful to young skin. Often, those were promotions done in partnership with brands.",
      "Nielsen data show that households with children 12 and under spent $2.4 billion in 2023 on skincare and makeup \u2014 more than households with teens.",
      "ALSO READ:\u00a0California bill targeting anti-aging skincare sales to minors dies without vote | \"Sephora kids\" investigation",
      "Dr. Smita Awasthi, director of pediatric dermatology at U.C. Davis Health, said certain skincare products are meant to peel the skin, but removing the outer layer of a child's skin can lead to painful rashes and increased risk of sunburns. While she does prescribe retinoids for acne treatment to children in some rare cases, she stresses there is a stark difference between over-the-counter retinoid acne treatments and the retinol used in cosmetics.",
      "\"When I'm prescribing a retinoid, I know the concentration, and I know exactly what it is and how it's going to work,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Cosmetic retinol products include different ingredients which she said can lead to increased risk of irritation and adverse reactions in young skin.",
      "Packaging for over-the-counter acne retinoids clearly identify that it is an acne treatment, she said. But many popular skincare products that contain retinols and other harsh anti-aging ingredients don't clearly identify what they are intended for or that the ingredients can be harmful to young skin.",
      "Kierstyn McBrayer, a 22-year-old content creator who focuses on makeup and skincare, told CBS News her audience is mostly tweens. Her 16-year-old sister first got into skincare about three years ago, she said, and was using products with retinol and vitamin C until she realized they weren't good for her skin. Other viewers have told her they were doing the same until they learned what was harming their skin.",
      "\"A lot of the problem is just kids watching adults doing skincare content, and I know a lot of these adults are probably not purposely aiming their content at children, but it's kind of hard because it's like [in the] past few years, skincare content has been considered heavily by children,\" she said.",
      "In California, lawmakers are considering a bill that would make it illegal to sell certain anti-aging cosmetics to children under 18 years old. The bill was defeated last year and reintroduced in the current legislative session.",
      "But while the proposed law would target retailers, brands could continue to use social media and kid-friendly branding and packaging to market their products to children.",
      "A CBS News review of 240 recent skincare posts from a dozen popular teen influencers on TikTok showed only 15 videos, or just 6% of posts, were tagged as promotional content.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission requires that online influencers disclose when they have a \"material connection\" to a brand, including being paid or receiving free products. The agency's website specifies the disclosure should not be mixed in with a group of hashtags or links.",
      "TikTok instructs creators to turn on the \"content disclosure setting\" when promoting a brand or product; this would add a label to the video that clearly states the footage is \"promotional content\" or a \"paid partnership.\" If the setting is not enabled, TikTok could remove or restrict the video.",
      "Embreigh Courtlyn, 15, often posts \"get ready with me\" TikToks \u2014 chatty, casual videos showing people doing skincare or makeup or getting dressed. In one video, she holds up two face masks from the Korean skincare brand I Dew Care, saying, \"It's my favorite face mask ever.\" At the bottom of the video is a small label that reads \"paid partnership.\"",
      "Courtlyn's manager told CBS News, \"For any brand deal she accepts, she either enables the paid partnership tab or includes #[brand]partner in the caption to ensure compliance with FTC guidelines.\"",
      "Sometimes TikTokers signal promos to their audience in less obvious ways, such as putting #ad or #partner in the caption.",
      "Mar Taylor, a 17-year-old with more than 270,000 TikTok followers, said the skincare brands he's worked with have instructed him on how to stylize and label the footage. Taylor used the hashtag \"glowpartner\" in a TikTok advertising Glow Recipe's new toner. Taylor also said brands can give influencers a custom discount code to share with their audience, and the influencers receive a cut of the money when people use the code.",
      "McBrayer said sometimes brands will ask her not to label her collaboration videos with #ad. Instead, they ask to be referred to as \"partners.\"",
      "She said this may be because videos with #ad don't perform as well, something she has noticed in her own TikTok content.",
      "This means that whether content creators intend to or not, they're advertising products to children who may not realize they're being marketed to.",
      "\"We know that developmentally, they don't recognize ads at the same level that adults do,\" said Drew Cingel, an associate professor at U.C. Davis who studies the intersection of adolescents, psychology and social media marketing. \"And it becomes much more blurred in a social media environment.\"",
      "\"I can't tell you how many tweens that I've spoken to that say, when I grow up, I want to be an influencer,\" he added. \"If they see a teenage influencer getting these products, getting likes and getting all of the social gratification and money, that's what they're going to want to do.\"",
      "As the skincare trend among tweens has grown, some brands launched counter-marketing campaigns to tell kids they don't need elaborate skincare routines. Dove launched a campaign called \"Face of 10\" where dermatologists post videos aiming to inform kids about appropriate skincare. On Instagram, Kiehl's posted an image of a young boy in the sand labeled \"the only exfoliating kids should do,\" and a young girl in a ballet class labeled \"the only 10-step routine kids should learn.\"",
      "At the same time, many skincare brands feature kid-friendly packaging and marketing. While Drunk Elephant advertises \"skincare smoothies,\" Glow Recipe sells a $76 \"glow essentials kit\" in a box made to look like a pink locker and labeled \"back to school.\" The set contains a watermelon toner and strawberry primer with beta hydroxy acid and a lip balm with hyaluronic acid, all ingredients dermatologists say tweens should avoid.",
      "Drunk Elephant and Glow Recipe did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "\"How do you get a child's attention amid all these other products in a store?\" Cingel said. \"You put fruits, you put things that are cute on it, you put bright colors, we know that those things draw and hold children's attention.\"",

      "People who understand AI and, equally important, who are adept at explaining how it works in simple terms, will find themselves in demand, Seamans predicted. For example, he expects companies to recruit what he calls \"AI explainers\" or \"AI translators\" who can help managers better understand an organization's AI tools.",
      "\"The job is to provide a simple layperson's understanding of what's happening under the hood,\" he said.",

    "published": "Sat, 20 Dec 2025 08:42:58 -0500",
    "summary": "Tourists visiting the Trevi Fountain are now going to pay more than just the legendary coin toss over their shoulder.",
    "story": [
      "Tourists visiting the Trevi Fountain are now going to pay more than just the legendary coin toss over their shoulder to get the Instagrammable selfie in front of one of the world's most celebrated waterworks.",
      "Starting Feb. 1, the city of Rome is imposing a 2-euro, or $2.35, fee for tourists to get close to the fountain during prime-time daylight hours. The view for those admiring the late Baroque masterpiece from the piazza above remains free.",
      "The tourist fee announced Friday is part of the Eternal City's efforts to manage tourist flows in a particularly congested part of town, improve the experience and offset the maintenance costs of preserving all of Rome's cultural heritage. Officials estimate it could net the city $7.6 million extra a year.",
      "The fee, which has been discussed and debated for more than a year, follows a similar ticketing system at Rome's Pantheon monument.",
      "In such cases, city residents have been exempt from the fees. The same holds true at Trevi, while the tourist tax and new 5-euro or nearly $6 tourist ticket fee for some city museums is being rolled out in conjunction with a plan to broaden the number of museums that are free for registered Roman residents.",
      "\"We believe that culture is a fundamental right of citizenship,\" Rome Mayor Roberto Gualtieri told a news conference. \"We think it's correct and positive that the citizens of Rome can enjoy our museums free of charge.\"",
      "At the same time, he said, the Trevi tourist fee is a minimal amount that shouldn't discourage visitors, but rather allow for a more organized visit. The city decided to impose it after seeing positive results already from a yearlong experiment to stagger and limit the number of visitors who can reach the front basin edge of the fountain by imposing lines and an entrance and exit pathway.",
      "So far this year, around 9 million people have waited in line to get that close-up visit, with some days as many as 70,000 passing through, Gualtieri said. That system now becomes permanent from 9 a.m.-9 p.m., with the fee to be paid by nonresidents. Visitors can either pay in advance online, while waiting in line or by buying tickets at tourist locations around town.",
      "After nightfall, access is open and free.",
      "Pope Urban VIII initially commissioned the fountain in 1640. In 1730, Pope Clement XII revived the project and the current fountain corresponds to the original designs of Roman architect Nicola Salvi.",
      "The towering fountain features at the Titan god flanked by falls cascading down the travertine rocks into a shallow turquoise pool, where Marcello Mastroianni and Anita Ekberg famously took their nighttime dip in \"La Dolce Vita.\"",
      "While bathing is prohibited nowadays, legend has it that visitors who toss a coin over their shoulders and make a wish will return to Rome.",
      "European officials have sought to curb overtourism amid protests from residents who say large amounts of visitors are making cities difficult to live in. Last year, Venice became the first city to\u00a0impose a tax for day-tripping tourists. A spate of viral incidents, including a woman who scaled the Trevi Fountain to\u00a0fill up her water bottle\u00a0and a British man who\u00a0carved his and his girlfriends' initials\u00a0into the Colosseum, also drew attention to the issue.",
      "\"These tourists are also vandals, because they have no respect for our cultural heritage, which belongs not just to Italy, but to the whole world,\" said Daniela Santanch\u00e8, Italy's tourism minister, at the time. \"We've introduced a bill with a very simple concept: You break it, you pay for it.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 19 Dec 2025 16:18:02 -0500",
    "summary": "Nine drug manufacturers will offer their drugs to Medicaid recipients at most-favored-nation discounts in exchange for tariff exemptions.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Friday announced new agreements with nine pharmaceutical manufacturers aimed at reducing certain prescription drug prices.",
      "\"Starting next year, American drug prices will come down fast and furious and will soon be the lowest in the developed world,\" Mr.\u00a0 Trump said Friday at the White House.",
      "Under the deal, the nine manufacturers will offer their drugs to Medicaid recipients at most-favored-nation discounts, a policy that requires the prices to match those paid by patients in other developed nations. The nine companies will also offer medicines \"at a deep discount off the list price\" to Americans through TrumpRx, according to the White House. The Trump administration plans to offer tariff exemptions to the drugmakers for three years in exchange for the MFN pricing commitments.",
      "According to a White House fact sheet, the drugs that will be covered include treatments for chronic conditions, including type two diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hepatitis B and C, human immunodeficiency virus and certain cancers.",
      "Amgen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol Myers Squibb, Genentech, Gilead Science, GSK, Merck, Novartis, and Sanofi will sell drugs on TrumpRx, the administration's discount drug pricing program. TrumpRx \u2014 which the administration has said will launch early next year \u2014 will not sell drugs directly, but instead will direct consumers to lower prices elsewhere.",
      "Senior administration officials said that roughly 30-40% of Medicaid drug prices are currently higher than what patients in other wealthy nations pay, mostly Europeans, and that the prices of those drugs will drop.",
      "The president has previously announced agreements with AstraZeneca, EMD Serono, Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Pfizer. The White House said it has made MFN deals with 14 of the 17 biggest drug manufacturers in the world. The three drugmakers that were not part of the announcement are AbbVie, Johnson & Johnson and Regeneron, but the president said that deals involving the remaining three could be announced at another time.",
      "\"[The policy] affects every American so that they have the dignity to access the same medical innovations that our tax dollars helped develop,\" a White House official said. \"This is about healthcare fairness.\"",
      "But questions remain about how the president's deals with drugmakers will work \u2014 and who will feel the difference at the pharmacy counter. Most-favored-nation pricing could have a muted impact on Medicaid patients, experts say, because the program already has a statutory \"best price\" protection that guarantees the lowest price offered to any U.S. commercial payer. Also, while it could save states money, Medicaid users typically don't pay out-of-pocket for their medication.",
      "Medicaid recipients are \"starting out at prices well below the averages seen in the U.S. market,\" Darius Lakdawalla, chief scientific officer at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center, pointed out to CBS News after the president announced the Pfizer deal.",
      "The White House said the new agreement represents more than $150 billion in new investment commitments in manufacturing and research and development in the U.S.",
      "In addition to the drugmakers' commitment to MFN and TrumpRx, several drugmakers' will be donating active pharmaceutical ingredients to the Strategic Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Reserve, an initiative designed to stockpile critical raw materials and drug components in order to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign drug manufacturing during disruptions like pandemics.",
      "\"This is the president's answer to pharmaceutical vulnerability, such that when the disaster strikes, whether it's natural catastrophe, pandemic or a national security emergency, America will be ready,\" a senior administration official said.",
      "Officials said the administration expects to see \"major reductions in Medicaid prices\" as it aims to match the prices of several Medicaid drugs with MFN levels.",
      "\"Medicaid has prices that are much higher than what other European nations pay,\" a senior administration official said. \"Americans should not pay more than other developed nations.\"",
      "But injectable drugs and infusion medications will not be available on TrumpRx because the White House has concluded these drugs must be administered by health care providers and should not be on a direct-to-consumer platform.",

    "published": "Fri, 19 Dec 2025 16:13:36 -0500",
    "summary": "Economists had expected CPI to rise at an annual rate of 3% last month.",
    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index rose at an annual rate of 2.7% in November, cooler than economists had forecast and a sign that price pressures may be easing.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was expected to rise 3% on an annual basis last month, according to economists surveyed by financial data firm FactSet. In the most recent inflation reading, from September, the CPI rate rose 3% on an annual basis.",
      "November's cooler inflation data comes after prices had inched higher throughout much of the year, with economists pointing to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "The CPI tracks the changes in a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, providing a snapshot of price changes on everyday items such as food and apparel.",
      "So-called core inflation, or CPI data that excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose by 2.6% over the past 12 months, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. Economists polled by FactSet had predicted a 3% increase for that measure.",
      "Food prices rose 2.6% on an annual basis in November, down from 3.1% in September.",
      "Thursday's report provides the first glimpse of recent inflation data since late October, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics released September CPI data.",
      "Data collection was disrupted due to the government shutdown, which delayed the September and November CPI reports. The Labor Department on Thursday said it didn't collect October data due to the shutdown, but said it was able to retroactively acquire some non-survey data for the month.",
      "What economists are saying",
      "Wall Street analysts cautioned that the November inflation figures may be distorted by the government shutdown, which disrupted data collection. The December CPI report should offer a clearer signal of whether the latest reading is a one-off or evidence that price pressures are truly easing, said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.",
      "\"It's possible that this does reflect a genuine drop off in inflationary pressures, but such a sudden stop, particularly in the more-persistent services components like rent or shelter is very unusual, at least outside of a recession,\" he said in a research note.",
      "Bernard Yaros, lead economist at Oxford Economics, also said some \"caution is warranted\" in interpreting the November inflation data, given the housing component was unusually weak in the prior two months.",
      "Some analysts said the softer-than-expected inflation reading paves the way for an interest rate cut in January. That helped boost the three major stock indices, which all traded higher Thursday morning after the release of the CPI data. Interest rate traders now place the likelihood of a January rate cut at around 27%, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.",
      "However, given gaps in the data, the Fed may put more weight on the December CPI release, which will be issued before the central bank's next interest rate decision in January, according to Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions in Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "\"The Fed will instead focus on the December CPI released in mid-January, just two weeks before its next meeting, as a more accurate bellwether for inflation,\" he said in an email.",
      "New York Federal Reserve President John Williams told\u00a0CNBC on Friday that data distortions likely pushed the CPI reading down by \"probably a tenth or so.\"",
      "What it means for Americans' wallets",
      "Food prices are cooling, although certain grocery items remain expensive. Coffee has climbed 18.8% from a year ago, and ground beef has risen 14.9%.",
      "Some retailers have gradually passed along the costs of the Trump administration's tariffs to consumers, fueling concerns about higher prices. Still, tariff-driven inflation has been milder than many feared, Garrett Melson, a portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions, said in an email ahead of the CPI release.",
      "In some cases, companies have absorbed the added costs rather than raising prices, while others stockpiled goods ahead of the tariffs, helping blunt price increases.",
      "In November, President Trump cut tariffs on a slate of products that the U.S. typically imports, including bananas and coffee, as his administration sought to address consumer frustrations over\u00a0affordability.",
      "While inflation is expected to ease next year, Americans could continue to face cost pressures, said Gregory Daco, chief economist at consulting firm EY-Parthenon.",
      "\"I don't think Americans should brace for surging inflation, but I do think there is a growing risk of a persistent affordability crisis,\" he told CBS News earlier this month. \"Given prices are rising at a faster clip than they normally would, and income trends are slowing.\"",

    "summary": "Millions of people with an Affordable Care Act health plan face a massive jump in premiums next year \u2014 this chart shows just how much.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of Americans are bracing for higher health costs in 2026, as subsidies that help them pay for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act are set to expire on December 31.",
      "Experts warn\u00a0that a failure in Congress to extend the tax credits could be financially devastating for individual policyholders, while also raising health care costs as a whole. Roughly 22 million Americans receive the ACA subsidies, which were created in 2021 to lower households' monthly premiums.",
      "New\u00a0data from investment adviser SmartAsset projects how much people around the U.S. with an ACA plan would have paid on average for coverage in 2025 if they hadn't received the enhanced subsidies. As the analysis shows, monthly premiums for the government health insurance would've been hundreds of dollars higher.",
      "In Mississippi, where around 11% of residents are enrolled in an ACA plan, participants would have seen their average monthly premiums jump from $41 to $605, a 1,376% increase, SmartAsset found. In West Virginia, enrollees' premiums would have risen an average of 1,058%.",
      "A spokesperson for SmartAsset said the analysis captures 2025 costs, but noted the data amounts to a \"close approximation\" of how much more people with ACA coverage could expect to pay next year without the tax credits.",
      "SmartAsset used public records from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' 2025 Marketplace Open Enrollment Period to calculate the average cost of ACA plans.",
      "The exact price hikes people could see next will depend on a range of factors, including their insurance plan, age, household income, health status and where they live, according to a spokesperson from KFF. The health policy group estimates that annual out-of-pocket premium costs will increase 114% on average for the 22 million ACA enrollees who rely on the subsidies.",
      "What is the status of the ACA tax credits?",
      "The tax credits are set to lapse at the end of the year. Democratic lawmakers have pushed for an extension\u00a0but lack enough support in the Republican-led Congress. And while the House passed a health care bill this week that includes several policies favored by Republicans, it excludes an extension of the tax credits and faces hurdles in the Senate.",
      "Both chambers of Congress have left Washington until early next year, making it all but certain that the tax credits will expire on December 31. But four GOP members this week signed a Democratic measure to force a vote on extending the subsidies for three years, teeing up a final vote early next year.",
      "If Congress fails to solve the tax credit issue, some enrollees will qualify for a smaller subsidy, while others could lose eligibility completely, according to KFF.",
      "With sharply higher ACA costs on the horizon, the Congressional Budget Office estimates\u00a0that about 4 million people could drop their health insurance altogether. Experts say that could lead to higher costs for people with other types of health insurance because hospitals will have\u00a0to provide more uncompensated care for those lacking coverage.",
      "\"Hospitals can only reconcile that by raising their prices for everybody,\" Emma Wager, a senior policy analyst at KFF, told CBS News last week.",

    "summary": "A bankruptcy judge blocked an attempt by a nursing home chain's primary investor to shield himself from settlement payments and liability in lawsuits over allegations of poor care.",
    "story": [
      "A bankruptcy judge blocked an attempt by a nursing home chain's primary investor to shield himself from settlement payments and liability in lawsuits alleging hundreds of patient injuries and deaths, encouraging those pursuing millions in damages.",
      "Genesis HealthCare, once the nation's largest nursing home chain, filed for Chapter 11 reorganization bankruptcy in July with a proposal to protect its controlling investor, Joel Landau, from legal liability. In court papers, Genesis had originally estimated all its settled and pending cases \u2014 which it said numbered nearly a thousand \u2014 would cost $259 million to resolve.",
      "KFF Health News reported this month that in the years before filing for bankruptcy, Genesis had settled at least 155 patient injury and death lawsuits with provisions that allowed it to delay paying, sometimes for more than a year. As a result, when Genesis filed for bankruptcy in July, it still owed $41 million out of the $58 million promised in those settlements with families of current or former residents, according to the bankruptcy and case records KFF Health News reviewed.",
      "In hearings Wednesday and last week in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Dallas, Judge Stacey G.C. Jernigan said she would not approve a sale of the company's assets that included legal releases from liability for Landau and a private equity associate, David Gefner. Landau, who was seeking to purchase the assets through another company he controlled, did not attend the bankruptcy hearings or respond to a subpoena, lawyers said in court.",
      "\"I'm very encouraged that someone is watching and paying attention to this,\" said Erin Pearson, whose father, James Sanderson, died in 2018 after spending less than a month in a Genesis facility in Albuquerque. \"And the guy who owns the most shares, not only did he not show up but doesn't just get to move things around and rebuy\" the nursing homes.",
      "According to Pearson's lawsuit, filed in 2019, Sanderson developed a bowel obstruction and sepsis while at the facility but was not sent to the hospital for more than a week.",
      "Genesis did not pay Pearson the $500,000 it agreed to in a settlement, according to Pearson's claim filed in bankruptcy court. \"I don't know if I'll ever see that settlement, but I would like to be hopeful,\" Pearson said in an interview Dec. 17.",
      "Genesis, Landau, Gefner, and their attorneys did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In a public statement last week, David Harrington, the executive chairman of Genesis' board of directors, praised Landau and his company's investment in Genesis for helping it avoid bankruptcy in 2021. That \"lifeline,\" he said, enabled Genesis to transform into a \"nimble, market-based model dedicated to prioritizing resident and patient care.\"",
      "Ian Norris, who represents 19 clients with lawsuits against Genesis \u2014 including four who have not been paid their settlements \u2014 said the judge's ruling was \"a huge win for all those who were confronting the possibility that they would not be able to recover the settlements that were promised to them by Genesis prior to the bankruptcy.\"",
      "According to Genesis' bankruptcy filings, the company owes more than $1.6 billion in unpaid claims that are not secured by liens, including claims not only from former residents and their families but also from a pension fund; contractors that provided health services and equipment; and Pennsylvania, New Mexico, and West Virginia, which are owed provider taxes. Daniel Simon, a lawyer representing Genesis' owners, said in court on Dec. 17 that $155 million would be available from the proceeds of the sale for these creditors under a bid for the nursing home assets from a new company controlled by Landau and Gefner.",
      "Genesis last month held an auction for its assets and announced that Landau's bid was the best, but the U.S. Trustee's Office and creditors objected, saying Genesis had unfairly excluded one group from bidding and downplayed the value of another group's bid that would have provided more money to creditors. Jernigan said there were too many irregularities in the auction for her to approve it and ordered it be redone under the watch of the U.S. Trustee's Office.",
      "\"I am aware that there is huge concern about Mr. Landau, and he is not here,\" Jernigan said last week. \"There is no way I can approve these releases without him on the witness stand and me being convinced of his good faith.\"",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who along with two Senate colleagues filed an amicus brief questioning the fairness of the auction, said in a media statement: \"A private equity company tried to abuse the bankruptcy system to slither out of paying what they owe to neglected seniors in its nursing homes. This is a textbook case of why we need to get private equity out of health care altogether, and this decision is a good step forward in the fight to deliver relief for the victims of Genesis.\"",
      "In the Dec. 17 hearing, representatives of the company controlled by Landau and Gefner said they would bid again for the remains of Genesis without the promise of liability releases. The auction is expected to occur in January. Simon, the lawyer for Genesis, said at the hearing that the judge's ruling \"has humbled us.\"",
      "Lawyers for former and current Genesis residents said they hope to sue Landau and other parties that controlled the company and led it into bankruptcy. John Anthony, a Tampa attorney who represents 341 claimants, said, \"The victims believe that Mr. Landau richly deserves his day in court, so he can explain to a jury of his peers how he has apparently gotten so rich running all these supposedly insolvent facilities into the ground.\"",

      "DraftKings is entering the red-hot prediction markets business, launching technology that lets users trade contracts linked to sporting and financial events.",
      "DraftKings said event contracts will be available for trading in 38 states and that the company will eventually expand beyond sports and finance into other markets, such as entertainment and culture. The sports betting company announced Friday it is debuting DraftKings Predictions, a mobile app and web product that will be regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.",
      "\"Along with our operational footprint, marketing and analytics infrastructure and advanced in-house technology, we believe we are uniquely positioned to lead this space over the long term,\" Corey Gottlieb, chief product officer of DraftKings, said in a statement.",
      "DraftKings said its app, which is expected to be available in major app stores within days, will connect with multiple exchanges, starting with the derivatives marketplace CME Group.",
      "Once they have a DraftKings account, users can enter the DraftKings Predictions app and start trading by clicking on the yes/no questions associated with an event, such as an NFL game, and deciding how much money they want to wager.",
      "More specifically, users originate the trades, while DraftKings acts as a broker, Jeanine Hightower-Sellitto, the general manager of DraftKings Predictions, told CBS News.",
      "\"We're handling that order and it's getting sent to an exchange for it to be executed,\" she explained.",
      "DraftKings faces growing competition from prediction markets \u2014 including Kalshi and Polymarket, now valued at $9 billion and $11 billion, respectively \u2014 that enable users to speculate on the outcome of sports and other events.",
      "In October, DraftKings\u00a0announced\u00a0the acquisition of Railbird Technologies, a federally regulated prediction market. At the time, DraftKings said the deal supports its \"broader strategy to enter prediction markets.\"",
      "Some prediction market platforms lacking a license for sports wagering have faced pushback from state regulators. Event contracts traded on markets are regulated differently from sports bets, which are illegal in certain states.",
      "Others have criticized the move by prediction markets to facilitate speculation on sports. Charlie Baker, the president of the NCAA, recently called out Kalshi on\u00a0social media\u00a0after the company filed forms to accept bets on the transfer decisions and status of student-athletes, saying it would threaten \"competition integrity and recruiting processes.\"",
      "\"We certify markets all the time that we do not end up listing,\" Kalshi said on X\u00a0on Dec. 18. \"We have no immediate plans to list these contracts.\"",
      "Headquartered in Boston, DraftKings was launched in 2012 as a sports entertainment and gaming company. Among its offerings are a fantasy sports product, which allows users to build virtual sports team lineups and compete against other users, and a mobile sports betting platform called DraftKings Sportsbook, where customers can place bets on sports, players, leagues and events.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 TikTok has signed a deal to sell its U.S. operations to a consortium of American investors, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News.",
      "Axios was first to report the deal.",
      "Under a law passed last year, TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, must either sever ties with the social media platform's American operations or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services. The law set a January 2025 deadline, but President Trump has extended it several times, most recently until Jan. 23, 2026.",
      "In September, Mr. Trump signed an executive order paving the way for a deal brokered by his administration to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. under a new corporate structure with American investors.",
      "At the time, a senior White House official said that under the proposed deal, ByteDance's content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok will be copied and retrained to run solely on the data of its U.S. user base. Cloud-computing firm Oracle will provide \"top to bottom security\" by hosting Americans' user data and reviewing the app's code to ensure \"the algorithm is behaving appropriately and it's secure,\" the official said.",
      "The deal will establish a \"joint venture\" based in the U.S., with a majority of U.S. investors and owners and a majority of Americans on its board of directors, the White House said in September. Mr. Trump's executive order says ByteDance and its affiliates will own less than 20% of the new entity, keeping it below the limit on foreign ownership set by last year's divest-or-ban law.",
      "A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, are expected to have a stake in the new TikTok, the White House previously said. (Oracle was cofounded by Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "Axios reported Thursday that Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX will collectively own 45% of the U.S. entity. Almost one-third of the new entity will be owned by current ByteDance investors, according to Axios.",
      "When reached by CBS News Thursday, an Oracle spokesperson declined to comment on the deal.",
      "\"We feel 100% confident that this proposal, if it's completed, complies with the law,\" the senior White House official said in September, adding that the White House believes it \"complies with all the relevant laws and policies on both sides.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters that Chinese President Xi Jinping signed off on the deal during a call in September. \"He gave us the go-ahead,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "China's comments about what has been agreed to have been more vague.",
      "\"China's position on the TikTok issue is clear: The Chinese government respects\u2002the wishes of the company in question, and would be happy to see productive commercial negotiations in keeping with market rules lead to\u2002a solution that complies with China's laws and regulations and takes into account the interests of both sides. The U.S. side needs to\u2002provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese investors,\" the Chinese government's summary of the September call between Xi and Mr. Trump said.",
      "The sale-or-ban law, which was\u00a0upheld by the Supreme Court, took effect a day before Mr. Trump's inauguration last January. Mr. Trump, however, has issued\u00a0new orders\u00a0every few months directing the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failing to remove the widely popular app from their platforms.",
      "There's been little pushback from lawmakers, who for years raised concerns about TikTok's potential risks to national security if the Chinese government was able to access the vast amount of Americans' data collected by the app or carry out influence operations through it.",
      "But some are likely to see the deal as not going far enough when it comes to TikTok's algorithm. After the White House announced the deal in September, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the chairman of the House China committee, expressed concern.",
      "\"Transitioning to a majority American-owned entity would mark an important step in that process that could mitigate some of the ByteDance threat depending on the details, but divestment was not the law's only requirement,\" Moolenaar said in a statement. \"The law also set firm guardrails that prohibit cooperation between ByteDance and any prospective TikTok successor on the all-important recommendation algorithm, as well as preclude operational ties between the new entity and ByteDance.\"",

      "The FTC said Instacart's promise of free delivery to shoppers placing an order through the platform for the first time amounted to false advertising because the offer required that they pay a \"service fee\" to receive their groceries.",
      "Instacart also failed to stand behind its \"100% satisfaction guarantee\" because it implied that it offered full refunds for dissatisfied customers, which the company failed to provide, regulators allege. Instead, customers whose orders were late or incomplete only received a small credit to use on a future order.",

      "Additionally, Instacart charged consumers for Instacart+ subscriptions, which offer perks like free or low-cost delivery, without their consent, the FTC said.",
      "\"We flatly deny any allegations of wrongdoing by the Federal Trade Commission, and we stand firmly behind the integrity and transparency of our programs. This settlement allows us to move forward and remain focused on delivering value for our customers, shoppers, and retail and brand partners in the communities we serve,\" an Instacart spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "Under the proposed settlement, the grocery service is banned from misrepresenting its delivery service costs and satisfaction guarantees. The company must also obtain consent from shoppers before they are enrolled in any Instacart subscriptions.",
      "Separately, the FTC this week also expressed concern after an investigation by Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive advocacy group, said the company is testing technology that can result in different consumers paying significantly different prices for the same grocery items.",

    "summary": "The president announced the one-time payments during his White House address on Wednesday. Here's what to know about timing, taxes and more.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Wednesday announced that U.S. service members will receive a $1,776 bonus, which he called a \"warrior dividend,\" before Christmas.",
      "Mr. Trump, who announced the plan in a White House address billed as focusing on affordability, said the amount was inspired by the year of the nation's founding.",
      "The money is \"to both thank them for their military service and to commemorate the 250 years the U.S. military has been defending the nation,\" the White House said in a statement Thursday.",
      "Here's what to know about the dividend.",
      "Is it a recurring bonus?",
      "The \"warrior dividend\" is a one-time pay bump for the nation's 1.45 million\u00a0military service members, according to the White House.",
      "\"1776; as you know, our great nation was founded in the crucible of revolution in that year,\" U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said in a social media video posted Thursday.",
      "\"As he announced to the nation last night, thanks to President Trump's unwavering commitment to our warriors and the provisions provided in the One Big, Beautiful Bill, more than 1.45 million service members will, in the coming days, receive a one-time tax-free bonus of $1,776,\" Hegseth said.",
      "The checks will be tax-free because they are being paid as a one-time basic allowance for housing supplement, The Hill\u00a0reported. The IRS\u00a0says\u00a0that such housing payments are considered a military benefit and are excluded from taxable income.",
      "Who gets a $1,776 check?",
      "Active duty service members who fell under the pay grades of O-6 or below as of Nov. 30 are eligible for the checks. Reserve component service members on active duty orders of 31 days as of that same date also qualify for the payments, according to the White House.",
      "In the Army, Marine Corps and Air Force, that includes people with the officer rank of colonel or below. For the Navy and Coast Guard, it includes those with the rank of captain or below.",
      "Active duty officers with an O-6 pay grade and two years of experience or less earn $8,340.90 a month, according to 2025 military pay charts. O-1 officers with the same amount of experience earn $3,998.40 monthly.",
      "When will the warrior dividend be paid?",
      "Military members are expected to receive their bonuses \"in the coming days,\" according to the White House.",
      "\"The checks are already on the way,\" Mr. Trump said from the White House on Wednesday. \"Nobody deserves it more than our military, and I say, 'congratulations' to everybody.\"",
      "In its statement on Thursday, the White House said service members can expect to receive the payments before Dec. 20.",
      "How is the dividend funded?",
      "On Wednesday, Mr. Trump suggested the \"warrior dividend\" payments are being funded both by his administration's tariffs and the\u00a0One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which he signed into law this summer.",
      "The payments, which are expected to total $2.6 billion, will come from a $2.9 billion appropriation to the military in the new tax and spending law, a senior administration official told CBS News.",
      "The White House didn't immediately return a request for comment about whether tariff revenue will also be directed to the fund the \"warrior dividend\" payments.",

      "Some small business owners say they are facing their own affordability crisis because of higher tariff, health insurance and energy costs.",
      "Shirley Modlin, who owns 3D Design and Manufacturing in Powhatan, Virginia, told CBS News that rising operational expenses are making it tough for her to offer raises and health insurance for her 10 workers.",
      "Modlin, whose company makes metal parts for the automotive, pharmaceutical, beverage and other industries, said uncertainty over where U.S. tariff rates will settle makes it hard to forecast her costs.",
      "\"It's the end of the year and my employees are expecting some kind of raise, but I don't know how much I can give them because I don't know what kind of impact the tariffs are going to continue to have on me,\" Modlin told CBS News.",
      "\"I feel like I am in a balancing act, and if I don't raise prices and my costs are going up, that squeezes my margins harder,\" she added.",
      "U.S. importers currently face an average effective tariff rate of 16.8%, the highest level since the 1930s, according to the Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan policy research center.",
      "Small business importers paid roughly $25,000 more per month on average due to the Trump administration's tariffs between April and September, compared to the same period in 2024, according to a\u00a0new analysis\u00a0from the Center for American Progress (CAP), a nonpartisan policy research institute.",
      "\"What should be a season of giving has become a season of paying for America's 36 million small businesses,\" Sen. Ed Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said at a press conference on Tuesday held by the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. \"They are paying more for affordable health care, more for electricity and more for just about everything, thanks to Trump's tariffs.\"",
      "The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the legality\u00a0of Mr. Trump's country-based tariffs soon. If they are struck down, however, he has other tools he can employ to implement similar levies, according to legal experts.",
      "Who's to blame?",
      "A spokesperson for the Republican members of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship blamed small businesses' challenges on Democrats.",
      "\"Four years of Democrat control of Washington created a historic affordability crisis for small businesses as inflation soared and an unprecedented $1.8 trillion in new regulations were created,\" the spokesperson told CBS News. \"In just 11 months, Republicans have begun to undo the damage by passing the largest tax cut in history to complement the $907 billion regulatory rollback being undertaken by the Trump administration.",
      "\"The results speak for themselves as we just witnessed a record number of holiday shoppers, core inflation fell to the lowest level in five years, and hardworking Americans' real wages will increase by $1,000,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Spokespersons for the White House and Small Business Administration didn't respond to a request for comment on the affordability concerns cited by some small businesses.",
      "Another major concern for Modlin and her workers is that enhanced tax credits for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) are set to expire at the end of 2025, which experts have said would sharply drive up premiums for more than 20 million Americans.",
      "An October CAP\u00a0analysis found that 4.4 million small business owners and self-employed Americans will see their health insurance costs rise by an average of $1,500 if the ACA subsidies are allowed to expire.",
      "In 2024, Modlin offered employees a $350 monthly stipend to help offset health plan costs. Now, she said she's trying to decide whether to increase that monthly payment or offer raises. She can't afford to do both, said Modlin, expressing concern about losing some of her machinists to larger competitors.",
      "\"I've interviewed job candidates who have said they need a better health insurance benefit,\" she said. \"The rest of our benefits are good, but I just can't keep up with the cost of insurance.\"",
      "Julie Robbins, CEO of Earthquaker Devices, an Akron, Ohio-based maker of guitar pedals and other musical effects products, said the 35-person company's costs have soared about 30% this year because of the sharply higher U.S. tariffs on imports.",
      "She and her husband, with whom she runs the business, purchase thousands of components sourced from more than a dozen countries to manufacture pedals in Ohio. The company has paid an additional $60,000 in tariffs this year, a figure that could rise to at least $180,000 in 2026, Robbins said at the Senate small business event held earlier this week.",
      "Robbins said Earthquaker plans to modestly hike its prices starting in January, noting that the company's suppliers have lifted their own prices. She acknowledges that such increases could scare away some customers.",
      "\"You can't calculate how demand will suffer from a price rise, so we try to avoid that whenever possible,\" Robbins told CBS News.",
      "In November, 34% of small businesses raised their average selling prices, an unusually sharp jump from previous months, according to Bank of America analysts, citing recent data from the National Federation of Independent Business.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. stock market scaled new heights in 2025, as investors largely tuned out concerns about the Trump administration's sharply higher tariffs and shrugged off fears of a financial market bubble among artificial intelligence companies.",
      "The S&P 500 stock index is up roughly 15% this year through Dec. 17\u2014 a strong performance, although lower than the heady 23% jump posted by the broad-based index in 2024. The S&P 500 has climbed an average of 13% per year over the last decade, according to Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at wealth management firm Janney Montgomery Scott.",
      "The Nasdaq Composite, which includes tech heavy-hitters such as Alphabet, Microsoft and Nvidia, has climbed more than 18% this year, while the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average is up more than 13%.",
      "The key question: Will such investor exuberance spill over into 2026, especially as concerns about an\u00a0AI bubble\u00a0percolate?",
      "\"I think conditions remain relatively fertile for stock prices to do OK overall,\" Luschini told CBS News. \"The big risk is that the whole AI narrative starts to lose a little of its viscosity.\"",
      "Other forecasters are also expecting a strong stock market performance in 2026. David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, expects the S&P 500, which closed Monday trading at 6,816 points, to reach 7,300 points by June of next year and 7,700 by the end of 2026. That would represent a roughly 15% gain over the next year.",
      "J.P. Morgan said in a November research report that it expects the S&P 500 to rise 13% to 15% next year, boosted by robust corporate earnings growth, and to carry that strength into 2027.",
      "What will drive stocks in 2026?",
      "Several catalysts are expected to drive the stock market in 2026. Among them is another year of strong corporate earnings, particularly in tech, analysts say. BofA Global Research expects overall earnings to grow in the mid-double digits next year.",
      "\"Multiple expansion and earnings growth both pushed the S&P 500 up 15% this year,\" the securities firm said in a market forecast. \"In 2026, earnings will do the lift.\"",
      "The AI boom should also help fuel the stock market, with a wave of capital investments likely to drive up tech stocks, analysts note. AI capital expenditures from major tech companies including Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Oracle are expected to approach $520 billion in 2026, Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial, said in a research note.",
      "Another area expected to benefit from the AI boom is the industrials sector, which is supplying the equipment necessary for data centers.",
      "Growth, however, won't be limited to tech or AI-adjacent sectors. Indeed, Bret Kenwell, a U.S. investment and options analyst at eToro, said a broadening of the bull market could be in the cards, with all 11 sectors in the S&P 500 expected to rise next year.",
      "\"If it happens, it'll have been five years since we've seen it,\" he said.",
      "Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, and Luschini both expect a good year for financial services stocks. Banks have traded very well this year amid an easier regulatory backdrop and a jump in mergers and acquisitions.",
      "Another tailwind for the stock market could be softer monetary policy and a more dovish Federal Reserve, Kenwell said, with President Trump soon expected to nominate a new central bank chief before Jerome Powell's term ends in May.",
      "\"It's kind of a when, not if, rate-cut situation with the Fed,\" Kenwell said.",
      "Still, analysts and major banks expect a slowdown in the pace of interest rate cuts. In a November report, J.P. Morgan forecasts one more interest rate cut in January before an extended pause and said that if the central bank further eases monetary policy, the S&P 500 could surpass 8,000 points in 2026.",
      "Is my money safe?",
      "The biggest shadow looming over the stock market next year is what will happen with artificial intelligence.",
      "AI and tech stocks have been the propelling force behind equity gains this year, with\u00a0earnings growth\u00a0from the \"Magnificent Seven\" far outpacing other companies in the S&P 500. That strength has been accompanied by a boom in capital expenditures, as investors rush to invest in data center construction and other technology infrastructure to meet rising demand for AI.",
      "\"Robust demand for cloud services and data center capacity shows no signs of slowing,\" Janus Henderson portfolio manager Jeremiah Buckley said in his company's 2026 outlook on capital investment.",
      "Amid all the hype, some investors are concerned about whether AI's ascendance could start to falter next year, leading to a market correction or the bursting of what some consider to be an AI bubble.",
      "In its 2026 outlook, Vanguard said it expects U.S. technology stocks to maintain momentum given the rate of investment and anticipated earnings growth. At the same time, the investment management company noted that \"risks are growing\" amid all of the AI optimism.",
      "Crisafulli said tech gains have historically moved in unison, but that started to splinter in November, when Alphabet shares surged 14% following the release of Google Gemini 3, while the rest of the Nasdaq slumped. The continued fracturing of the AI narrative is one of the headwinds he expects investors will have to face in 2026.",
      "\"It's not so much the bubbles bursting,\" he said. \"It's more just people looking at it in a more nuanced way.\"",
      "Still, as usual investors should expect some turbulence. Minor pullbacks or flat trading periods are possible, especially after several months of consecutive growth in the S&P 500, according to Kenwell.",
      "\"When we look at 2025, it was a good reminder that volatility is in play, and that's something that certainly can be back in the cards in 2026,\" he said.",

      "A months-long investigation by the nonprofit organizations Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative found that identical grocery items on Instacart could differ in price by as much as 23% from one customer to the next.",
      "That's due to the platform's algorithmic pricing experiments, which place different price tags on identical products without revealing the discrepancies directly to shoppers, the report found. The AI model, which Instacart started implementing in 2022, sets grocery prices at some large retail chains that partner with the San Francisco-based delivery company, the groups added.",

We would go to the supermarket and pay what was on the shelf,\" he told CBS News. \"Now, I think people are going to be worried: Am I getting ripped off?\"",
      "Instacart's AI-driven pricing technology has caught the attention of the Federal Trade Commission, which is now probing the company over its use of the tool, according to\u00a0Reuters.",
      "\"The Federal Trade Commission has a longstanding policy of not commenting on any potential or ongoing investigations,\" \u00a0the FTC said in a statement. \"But, like so many Americans, we are disturbed by what we have read in the press about Instacart's alleged pricing practices.\"",
      "Report finds major price discrepancies",
      "Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative based their findings on data gathered from online shopping sessions, in which hundreds of volunteers shopped on Instacart for identical baskets of goods from Safeway and Target.",
      "Of the 437 participants, every single one was exposed to algorithmic price experiments, according to the report. The investigation also found evidence of price experimentation at Albertsons, Costco, Kroger and Sprouts Farmers Market.",
      "According to Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative, Instacart has framed price differences between customers as \"negligible.\" However, the scope of the price experiments is \"far broader and more costly to some consumers than has been publicly acknowledged,\" the organizations said in the report.",
      "The investigation found that some products had as many as five different price points, with variations ranging from as little as 7 cents to $2.56 per item. During one test conducted for a Safeway in Seattle, the price for a box of Wheat Thins differed by as much as 23%.",
      "All told, the price variations could cost families $1,200 a year, based on how much Instacart says the typical household of four spends on groceries, the report found.",
      "Some products were unscathed by the price experiments. For example, at the Seattle Safeway, volunteers did not observe any price variations for items such as Premium brand saltine crackers, Heinz ketchup and Barilla farfalle pasta.",
      "Safeway didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Instacart told CBS News in a statement that 10 of its retailer partners are using pricing experiments, but did not specify which ones.",
      "\"Just as retailers have long tested prices in their physical stores to better understand consumer preferences, a subset of only 10 retail partners \u2014 ones that already apply markups \u2014 do the same online via Instacart,\" a spokesperson said in an email. \"These limited, short-term and randomized tests help retail partners learn what matters most to consumers and how to keep essential items affordable.\"",
      "Customers were also shown different \"original\" prices, making some savings appear larger, the report found, a concept known as \"fictitious pricing.\"\u00a0Amazon was sued this October\u00a0for allegedly using this tactic during its summer Prime Day sale.",
      "The rise of AI pricing models",
      "Dynamic pricing, which sets consumer prices based on demand, has long been part of the e-commerce landscape. However, while it's a common tactic in certain industries like travel, where supply is fixed, consumers may be surprised to see it cropping up in the grocery space, Saunders said.",
      "\"In retail, especially grocery retail, people expect the price to be the price,\" he said. \"They don't expect [it] to yo-yo up and down.\"",
      "Another issue, as the report points out, is that consumers often have no clue that they may be paying more for the same item. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC)\u00a0Act prevents \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices,\" including \"misleading cost or price claims.\" However, Saunders said he doesn't believe companies are legally obligated to tell customers that they are part of pricing experiments.",
      "\"Instacart shoppers we spoke to say they were unaware that they were participants in active Instacart pricing experiments and view the practice as manipulative and unfair,\" the report says.",
      "One example of dynamic pricing is surveillance pricing, a tactic employed by companies that involves using a shopper's behavior and personal data to make price evaluations, according to the FTC. Saunders said surveillance pricing has been supercharged by artificial intelligence, which can assess vast amounts of data at rapid speeds to determine price levels.",
      "Instacart told CBS News that it does not use personal, demographic or user-level behavioral data to set prices.",
      "As pricing models like Instacart's become more sophisticated, Brookman said he's concerned about what it could mean for consumers.",
      "\"I'm worried companies are going to use these sorts of algorithmic pricing models to charge us the maximum amount we're willing to pay, which is good for their profits, but not so good for [our wallets],\" he said.",

    "summary": "President Trump's media company is joining forces with a company working to commercialize fusion energy.",
    "story": [
      "Trump Media & Technology is merging with fusion energy company TAE Technologies in a deal worth more than $6 billion, aiming to harness the fledgling technology to power energy-hungry artificial intelligence data centers.",
      "TAE, which is privately owned, is developing technology aimed at producing energy by fusing atomic nuclei. Trump Media & Technology owns President Donald Trump's Truth Social platform.",
      "The merger comes amid a difficult year for Trump Media shares, which trade under the ticker DJT \u2014 the same as Mr. Trump's initials. Through Wednesday, the stock was down 69% for the year, even as the S&P 500 had gained 14%.",
      "After the merger was announced Thursday morning, Trump Media shares jumped $3.37, or 32%, to $13.84.",
      "Trump Media's strategic shift",
      "For Trump Media, the merger represents another strategic shift, given its 2021 launch as a business focusing on the conservative-leaning social media space.",
      "More recently, the company has pivoted beyond its roots as a tech business. Earlier this year, Trump Media struck a deal to raise $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin, creating a reserve of the cryptocurrency, and it has also rolled out investment funds with \"America-first\" strategies.",
      "The merger with TAE represents a continuation of Trump Media's \"America first\" principles, former California lawmaker Devin Nunes, now chief executive of Trump Media, said in a Thursday conference call with investors.",
      "\"Fusion power will lower energy prices, bolster our national defense and secure the energy needed to guarantee America's dominance of AI technology,\" Nunes said on the call.",
      "He added, \"This combination positions the combined company to help lead the global AI revolution and kickstart an American energy renaissance.\"",
      "After the merger closes next year, the company will \"quickly seek approvals to site and build the company's first utility-scale power plant,\" Nunes said. \"We expect siting to commence by year-end 2026, sending us on the path to build future plants expected to be 350 megawatt to 500 megawatt.\"",
      "AI power needs",
      "With tech companies building AI data centers across the U.S., their need for power is \"growing exponentially,\" according to a report earlier this year from Deloitte. Power demand for AI data centers could grow more than thirtyfold by 2035, up to 123 gigawatts from 4 gigawatts last year, the consulting firm noted.",
      "The combination represents \"a major play on creating the first public nuclear fusion company in the U.S.,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a report. TAE's investors include Google, Chevron and Goldman Sachs, he noted.",
      "TAE has \"safely built and operated five fusion reactors and importantly proven major energy and fusion breakthroughs over the years... putting TAE at the top of the mountain in the fusion global scene in our view,\" Ives said.",
      "Fusion power will prove to be \"the most dramatic energy breakthrough since the onset of commercial nuclear energy in the 1950s,\" Nunes said in a statement.",
      "Nunes will serve as co-CEO of the new company with TAE Technologies CEO Michl Binderbauer, according to a\u00a0statement\u00a0from the two companies Thursday.",

    "summary": "Negative views of the nation's economy persist as 2025 draws to a close.",
    "story": [
      "Many Americans are feeling the pinch this holiday season.",
      "Most feel it's at least somewhat difficult to afford the things they're buying for the holidays. Some are pulling back on gifts, entertainment and travel, particularly those among the majority who say items cost more now than they did last year.",
      "Holiday spending also spotlights the long-standing differences in Americans' financial situations. Those who report their financial situation as good, who tend to have higher incomes, say affording the holidays is easier. But even they say things are costing more.",
      "In all, the season often brings feelings of gratitude and happiness, but finances can factor into sentiments, too: those who say it is hard to afford things are more apt to say the season also brings stress.",
      "With holiday travel coming, many do feel they're getting relief on gas prices. More say they are going down more than going up \u2014 the first time we've seen that this year.",
      "Relatively few Americans say they will be buying more gifts, entertainment or airline tickets or food and drinks this holiday season, compared to recent years. Those who say it will be difficult to afford items this year are especially likely to say they will be scaling back on these things.",
      "The people who are keeping purchases steady or buying more this year tend to be those who say their financial situation is good.",
      "Feelings about the holiday season",
      "Overall, the holiday season evokes more positive feelings than negative ones, with many saying they are happy and grateful.",
      "But those who are having difficulty affording holiday expenses are especially likely to report feeling stressed, too.",
      "Looking back on 2025",
      "Views of the economy have been low for years, and 2025 continued that trend. But beneath those sentiments, the year also showed a consistent split between those who feel their finances are good and bad \u2014 the former generally having higher incomes and saying the stock market matters to their finances, the latter having lower incomes and being more impacted by prices and inflation.",
      "On personal finances, about half of the country continues to say their financial situation is good, while about half say it is bad, which has been the case throughout the year.",
      "Looking back, overall, for those whose financial situation changed over the year, more said it got worse rather than better.\u00a0 But those who did feel their situation improved were also more likely to be those with higher incomes.",
      "The year ends with most Americans voicing larger concerns about inflation that have persisted for years. Throughout 2025, about three-quarters said their incomes were not keeping pace with inflation. Views of the overall economy remain low.",
      "The public's evaluations of the U.S. job market specifically remain net negative. This comes as the latest government data shows somewhat of a mixed bag: more jobs were added in November than economists expected, but the unemployment rate ticked up to its highest level since September 2021.",
      "Among the bright spots, on balance, more Americans rate the condition of the stock market as good than rate it as bad, and that's particularly so among those for whom the market's performance matters a lot to their finances.",
      "More Americans now say the price of gas in their area is coming down than say it's going up \u2014 a reversal from what we saw this fall and over the year.",
      "Throughout the year, like today, Americans have had a collectively mixed outlook looking forward. Just over half of Americans expect a slowing economy or one in recession. While others expect a growing economy or one that holds steady.",

    "summary": "Warner Bros. Discovery's board told its shareholders that Paramount Skydance's offer \"provides inadequate value\" for the business.",
    "story": [
      "Warner Bros. Discovery on Wednesday urged shareholders to reject Paramount Skydance's $108.4 billion hostile takeover bid, arguing that it created \"significant risks and costs\" for the company and that Netflix's prior offer provides better value.",
      "The move follows competing bids for Warner Bros. Discovery, whose storied film library includes classics like \"Casablanca\" and the \"Harry Potter\" film series. Netflix agreed on December 5 to buy a part of Warner Bros. in a deal valued at $82.7 billion, while Paramount Skydance followed on December 8 with an all-cash offer for the entirety of the media conglomerate.",
      "In making the bid for all of Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison described it as a \"superior all-cash offer.\" Ellison said that its bid, combining the assets of Warner Bros. Discovery with Paramount Skydance (the parent of CBS News), would face an easier path through the government regulatory process.",
      "Paramount is offering $30 a share for the entire company, while Netflix agreed to buy Warner Bros.'s HBO as well as its streaming and studios business, including HBO Max and Warner Bros. Television, for $27.75 a share.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery's stock traded on Wednesday at $28.30 a share.",
      "Paramount Skydance on Wednesday said that it is sticking with its $30 per share offer, expressing confidence that the bid offers \"superior value\" to Netflix's bid.",
      "Paramount Skydance added that it believes a merger with Warner Bros. Discovery provides \"a faster, more certain path to completion than the Netflix transaction.\"",
      "\"I have been encouraged by the feedback we have received from WBD shareholders, who clearly understand the benefits of our offer,\" Ellison said in a statement. \"We will continue to move forward to deliver this transaction, which is in the best interest of WBD shareholders, consumers and the creative industries.\"",
      "Why Warner Bros. Discovery prefers Netflix",
      "In recommending that shareholders reject Paramount Skydance's bid, Warner Bros. Discovery said its board concluded the two offers pose an equal regulatory risk. Warner Bros. Discovery also said its analysis found that Netflix's offer, which includes cash and Netflix stock, is superior.",
      "It also raised concerns about Paramount Skydance's $40.65 billion equity commitment, for which Warner Bros. Discovery said \"there is no Ellison family commitment of any kind.\" David Ellison's father, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, is the world's fifth-richest person, with a net worth of $243 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery's recommendation comes shortly after one of Paramount Skydance's financial partners in the deal, Affinity Partners, said it had dropped out of the hostile bid. Affinity is the private equity firm founded by President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.",
      "An Affinity spokesperson told CBS News that, while it continued to believe in the \"strong strategic rationale\" for Paramount Skydance's offer, it had decided to pull back because \"the dynamics of the investment have changed significantly since we initially became involved in October.\"",
      "In a letter sent to shareholders, Warner Bros. Discovery's board said it believed Netflix's finances are also in better shape, with a stronger credit rating and a larger market capitalization.",
      "\"The Netflix merger is fully backed by a public company with a market cap in excess of $400 billion with an investment grade balance sheet,\" the letter stated.",
      "Paramount Skydance's credit rating is \"at or only a notch above 'junk' status from the two leading rating agencies,\" while its market valuation stands at $15 billion, Warner Bros. Discovery added.",

      "In 2023, the Highway Loss Data Institute, a unit of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety,\u00a0found\u00a0that Hyundai and Kia vehicles without \"engine immobilizers,\" an anti-theft device that were standard on other new cars at the time, had a vehicle theft claim rate of 2.18 per 1,000 insured vehicle years. The rest of the industry combined had a rate of 1.21.",
      "Under the nationwide settlement, the companies will offer a free repair to all eligible vehicles at a cost that could top $500 million, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said. Hyundai and Kia must also outfit all future vehicles sold in the U.S. with engine immobilizers, as well as pay up to $4.5 million of restitution to people whose vehicles were damaged by thieves.",
      "The settlement was reached by 35 states, including California, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. The vehicles eligible for fixes date as far back as 2011 and as recently as 2022. About 9 million eligible vehicles were sold nationwide.",

      "\"These include the development and introduction of a free software security upgrade that has been found to significantly reduce theft rates, the distribution of hundreds of thousands of steering wheel locks to our customers at no cost, and the rollout of a zinc-sleeve hardware modification that combats this social media-inspired theft method by reinforcing the ignition cylinder body and preventing its removal through the technique that was made popular online,\" the automaker said.",

    "summary": "Rifts over the direction of the conservative movement emerged during Turning Point USA's conference, as speakers attacked each other by name.",
    "story": [
      "Turning Point USA's annual AmericaFest highlighted a rift in the conservative movement that's emerged since the assassination of the group's co-founder, Charlie Kirk, in September.",
      "Over the course of the four-day conference, some of the speakers criticized one another by name. Podcaster and prominent right-wing personality Ben Shapiro called out Tucker Carlson, Steve Bannon and Megyn Kelly and accused them of being \"frauds and grifters\" and for entertaining far-right conspiracy theories following Kirk's killing.",
      "\"The conservative movement is in danger from charlatans who claim to speak in the name of principle but actually traffic in conspiracism and dishonesty,\" Shapiro said during his remarks Thursday night. He referred to Bannon as \"a PR flack for Jeffrey Epstein.\"",
      "One fault line that's emerged is how to handle the rise of far-right antisemitic and white supremacist influencer Nick Fuentes after Carlson recently interviewed him on his podcast. Many conservatives were outraged at Carlson for giving Fuentes a platform, though some have defended him.",
      "At AmericaFest, Shapiro went after Carlson for hosting Fuentes \u2014 whom he called \"a Hitler apologist, Nazi-loving, anti-American piece of refuse\" \u2014 on his podcast.",
      "Bannon, in his remarks, compared Shapiro to \"a cancer\" on the conservative movement.",
      "\"Ben Shapiro is like a cancer, and that cancer spreads,\" Bannon said. \"Mark my word, he will make a move on Turning Point, because he's always been envious of Charlie Kirk.\"",
      "The event was the first of its kind since Kirk was assassinated in September while speaking at a Utah university. The noticeable rift between speakers made some of the attendees uneasy.",
      "Deacon Jones, a 19-year-old Turning Point USA member from Tennessee, has attended two of the conservative group's conferences in the past, and he said this weekend's AmericaFest felt noticeably different compared to previous years after Kirk's death. Jones suggested Kirk's absence seemed to make a palpable difference.",
      "\"I I think Charlie used to be the beacon that everybody could trust; he would take everybody's ideas and kind of boil it down to something that everybody could agree with,\" Jones said. \"I think everybody's just trying to figure out, like, 'Where do we go from here? How do we figure out who to listen to, who to trust?'\"",
      "Jones was one of the more than 25,000 people who attended the conference, which took place in Phoenix, Arizona, and included prominent conservatives such as Vice President JD Vance, House Speaker Mike Johnson, Bannon, White House border czar Tom Homan, Carlson and a surprise appearance by rapper Nicki Minaj. President Trump called in to the conference by phone..",
      "Lucas Beaver, a 19-year-old Turning Point USA chapter president from North Carolina, told CBS News on Sunday that Fuentes is \"trying to grab the attention\" of the young conservatives.",
      "\"He tries to manipulate things, and in some ways, trying to hide his radicalism, in some ways, so that he can gain those people's trust,\" he said.",
      "Jones added that recent infighting is preventing the young conservative movement from finding common ground it needs to build on its momentum from 2024.",
      "\"We're making major issues minor and minor issues major. We're not talking about all the things we agree on. We're talking about all the things we're disagreeing on and splitting our party,\" Jones said.",
      "Andrew Kolvet, Turning Point's spokesman and executive producer of \"The Charlie Kirk Show,\" said no single figure can help resolve MAGA's internal conflict in the vacuum left by Kirk's death, adding that \"it's going to be a team effort.\" But he was hopeful about the more positive direction from Vance, who addressed the conference on Sunday, its final day.",
      "\"With JD Vance's final address, the capstone of this event. It kind of felt like, you know, Dad's home,\" Kolvet said. \"He's telling the kids to settle down. You know, here's what we stand for, here's the Northern Star, and this is what we're chasing after.\"",
      "Vance, who received Erika Kirk's endorsement for the\u00a0 2028 race, took the stage and attempted to smooth things over, telling conference-goers that the conservative movement is open to everyone as long as they \"love America.\"",
      "\"We have far more important work to do than canceling each other,\" Vance said. \"Charlie invited all of us here for a reason, because he believed that each of us, all of us, had something worth saying, and he trusted all of you to make your own judgment.\"",
      "Nick Perisse, a 19-year-old student from Florida, said he felt \"carefully enthusiastic\" about the future of the young conservative movement following Vance's remarks.",
      "\"Vice President Vance not only fulfilled all my previous expectations, he also exceeded them by delivering a uniting message that resonated very strongly with both diehard MAGA supporters and skeptics,\" Perisse told CBS News. \"I'm hopeful for what we can and will do for our country, but we must be careful not to let these internal disagreements and divisions cause us to collapse against ourselves.\"",
      "But, the tensions on display suggest the fight over the future of the conservative movement may just be getting started.",

    "published": "Mon, 22 Dec 2025 07:14:14 -0500",
    "summary": "The Justice Department has disclosed thousands of files and photos related to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, following years of pressure from lawmakers and abuse survivors.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department began disclosing\u00a0thousands of files and photos related to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein on Friday, following years of pressure from lawmakers and abuse survivors for more transparency into the government's investigations into the disgraced financier.",
      "The records were released in accordance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which passed last month and required the government to release virtually all Epstein-related files within 30 days.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said more files will be released \"over the next couple of weeks,\" even though the law required the documents to be disclosed by Friday. He later told lawmakers that the Justice Department needed more time to pore through the records and redact victims' names.",
      "Congressional Democrats have accused the Justice Department of failing to comply with the law, arguing the documents are too heavily redacted and should have been released in full on Friday.",
      "Where to find the Epstein files",
      "The files that were disclosed Friday under the Epstein Files Transparency Act are available on the Justice Department's website, broken into different data sets. Many of the files are photos, not text documents.",
      "CBS News is also uploading the records to a searchable database, which is available here.",
      "Here are the Justice Department's records:",
      "Data Set 1Data Set 2Data Set 3Data Set 4Data Set 5Data Set 6Data Set 7",
      "Data Set 1",
      "Data Set 2",
      "Data Set 3",
      "Data Set 4",
      "Data Set 5",
      "Data Set 6",
      "Data Set 7",
      "What's in the new Epstein files?",
      "Thousands of the files are images, including photos that were seemingly taken in Epstein's mansion in Manhattan or his private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Those include photos of his bedroom in New York, his risque wall art and a taxidermied tiger.",
      "Many photos show Epstein socializing with his convicted associate, Ghislaine Maxwell. Former President Bill Clinton also appears in several of the images \u2014 in some cases, the former president is posing with celebrities like Michael Jackson and Mick Jagger. A spokesperson has acknowledged that Clinton traveled with Epstein on several occasions, but says he was not aware of Epstein's crimes, and accused the Justice Department of trying to scapegoat Clinton on Friday.",
      "Some of the photos are redacted \u2014 in certain cases, they show Epstein posing with people whose faces are obscured.",
      "There are also a number of investigative documents, some of which have heavy redactions. In a few cases, documents are almost entirely redacted.",
      "Why were some of the Epstein files redacted?",
      "The law that requires the Justice Department to release the files only allows redactions under narrow circumstances, including to take out Epstein survivors' personal information, violent images or child sexual abuse material. The government is also allowed to temporarily withhold records that \"would jeopardize an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution.\"",
      "Records cannot be withheld solely because they would cause \"embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity.\"",
      "Some redactions in the documents released Friday appeared to omit victims' names, but the exact reasons for every redaction are unclear. The law also requires the department to give Congress a list of its redactions within 15 days.",
      "What was Epstein investigated for and charged with?",
      "The files that were released Friday are expected to stem from the litany of investigations surrounding Epstein and Maxwell, stretching back at least 20 years.",
      "Allegations about Epstein's conduct appeared to emerge on the government's radar as early as the 1990s, when survivor Maria Farmer says she reported to the FBI that Epstein had abused her. In a lawsuit, she has accused the government of failing to look into her allegations.",
      "Epstein was investigated by local police in Florida and federal prosecutors starting in the mid-2000s. That probe ended with a controversial 2007 deal in which federal prosecutors in Miami agreed not to charge him, in exchange for a guilty plea on prostitution charges in state court.",
      "More than a decade later, Epstein was charged in New York federal court with abusing and trafficking dozens of underage girls. Maxwell was charged with sex trafficking conspiracy the following year, and was convicted at trial and sentenced to 20 years in prison.",
      "Files from several other probes could be made public. The government has investigated the circumstances surrounding Epstein's death in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial in 2019, officially ruled a suicide. And it has investigated Miami prosecutors' decision to cut a non-prosecution deal.",
      "Why the Epstein files are being released now",
      "The files are being released under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which Congress passed and President Trump signed into law in November. The legislation gave the attorney general 30 days to publicly release documents related to Epstein, his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, the government's investigations into both and internal records about the cases.",
      "The legislation was the result of years of pressure from Epstein and Maxwell's survivors, who pushed lawmakers for more transparency about how the government handled both of their cases. Epstein's death fueled conspiracy theories about his connections to high-powered figures in government and the business world.",
      "The calls for transparency reached new heights over the summer. The Justice Department conducted a review of the Epstein files in the government's possession, and concluded that there was no \"client list\" or evidence that he had blackmailed prominent figures. The findings infuriated many of the president's supporters who had been calling for the release of the Epstein files for years, and opened the door for a bipartisan push to unveil the records.",
      "California Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat, was the lead sponsor of the Epstein Files Transparency Act. He introduced the bill in July, and GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky filed a discharge petition aimed at forcing a vote on the measure. The push was delayed by opposition from House Speaker Mike Johnson and the government shutdown in the fall. But in November, the petition received the final signature required to bring the bill up for a vote.",
      "It passed the House by a vote of 427 to 1 and the Senate unanimously approved it. President Trump signed it into law on Nov. 19, despite spending months pressuring Republicans to oppose it, starting the clock on the 30-day deadline.",
      "In the wake of Congress' passage of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, three separate judges approved Justice Department requests to unseal grand jury transcripts from investigations into Maxwell and Epstein. One of those rulings stemmed from grand jury proceedings in South Florida in 2005 and 2007. Epstein ultimately escaped federal charges there and instead agreed to plead guilty to state prostitution charges.",
      "The other two court orders came from judges in New York, where Epstein and Maxwell were charged in 2019 and 2020, respectively.",
      "When will the next group of Epstein files be released?",
      "It's unclear. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told Fox News earlier Friday that the department would release more files \"over the next couple of weeks.\"",
      "\"We are looking at every single piece of paper that we are going to produce making sure every victim \u2014 their name, their identity, their story, to the extent that it needs to be protected \u2014 is completely protected,\" Blanche said.",
      "That timeline does not comply with the law, which required the release of all eligible files by Dec. 19. The department's office of public affairs said before Friday's release that the \"initial deadline is being met as we work diligently to protect victims.\"",
      "Blanche's comments, and the department's failure to release all of the files, angered many Democrats who have harshly criticized the administration for its handling of the documents. Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, and Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, accused the Trump administration of violating the law and suggested they could take legal action.",
      "\"Donald Trump and the Department of Justice are now violating federal law as they continue covering up the facts and the evidence about Jeffrey Epstein's decades-long, billion-dollar, international sex trafficking ring,\" Raskin and Garcia said in a joint statement. \"For months, Pam Bondi has denied survivors the transparency and accountability they have demanded and deserve and has defied the Oversight Committee's subpoena. The Department of Justice is now making clear it intends to defy Congress itself, even as it gives star treatment to Epstein's convicted co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell.\"",
      "Raskin and Garcia said they are \"examining all legal options\" given Blanche's earlier admission.",
      "\"The survivors of this nightmare deserve justice, the co-conspirators must be held accountable, and the American people deserve complete transparency from DOJ,\" they said.",

    "story": [
      "The Department of Homeland Security has tripled its \"exit bonus\" for undocumented migrants who voluntarily depart the United States through self-deportation, increasing the financial incentive from $1,000 to $3,000 for those who register with the U.S. government and depart the country by the end of the calendar year.",
      "DHS says all qualified participants who leave by Dec. 31, 2025, will also receive free airfare to their home countries and be waived of certain civil fines or penalties tied to remaining illegally in the U.S., if they voluntarily self-deport using the rebranded CBP Home app. The smartphone app is modeled off the Biden administration's CBP One platform.",
      "Under the Trump administration's policy, migrants are instructed to use the platform to signal their intent to depart. If determined to be eligible, DHS officials say they will receive travel assistance plus the $3,000 paid stipend once the U.S. government confirms the individual has left the country.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem says that those who do not take advantage of the temporary incentive will be \"found,\" \"arrested\" and \"never return\" to the U.S.",
      "The CBP One app was originally built under the previous administration to schedule asylum appointments, but under the Trump administration's mass deportation agenda, it has been remodeled under a voluntary departure framework to permit those without lawful status to track their exit.",
      "DHS says the bonus stipend is part of a holiday season campaign aimed at accelerating removals and reducing taxpayer costs, with travel support typically considered less expensive than traditional detention and deportation operations. As of May 2025, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement estimated the average cost to arrest, detain and remove an undocumented migrant is approximately $17,000.",
      "As part of the self-deportation program, DHS says participants are deprioritized for ICE arrest and detention so long as they demonstrate \"meaningful strides\" toward leaving the U.S., though officials have not released detailed guidance explaining how long that protection lasts or how any compliance is judged.",
      "While ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection arrests nationwide are largely considered the most visible arm of the Trump administration's sweeping immigration crackdown, the president has simultaneously pushed to compel self-deportation of families and unaccompanied children who entered the country without permission.",
      "In October, the U.S. government announced plans to grant migrant teenagers a $2,500 stipend if they choose to return to their home countries voluntarily, CBS News previously reported.",
      "DHS says that since January 2025, 1.9 million undocumented immigrants have \"voluntarily self-deported,\" with \"tens of thousands\" doing so through the CBP Home program specifically. Those figures have not been independently verified by CBS News, and DHS has not publicly released a detailed breakdown showing how many individuals received government-funded travel or stipends versus those who departed on their own.",

      "The U.S. Coast Guard on Sunday was pursuing another sanctioned oil tanker in international waters, a U.S. official told CBS News, as the Trump administration appeared to be intensifying its targets of such vessels connected to the Venezuelan government.",
      "If caught and seized, it would be the third Venezuelan tanker taken by the U.S. this month.",
      "The U.S. official told CBS News Sunday's pursuit involved \"a sanctioned dark fleet vessel that is part of Venezuela's illegal sanctions evasion.\"",
      "\"It is flying a false flag and under a judicial seizure order,\" they said.",
      "The Coast Guard's pursuit of the tanker was first reported by Reuters. The U.S. officials who spoke with Reuters did not give a specific location for the operation or the name of the vessel being pursued.",
      "In a pre-dawn operation on Saturday, the U.S. Coast Guard seized a Panama-flagged vessel called Centuries. A U.S. official told CBS News that the interdiction of the vessel followed a similar playbook to an earlier U.S. seizure of an oil tanker near Venezuela.",
      "White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly said on social media that the vessel on Saturday was \"a falsely flagged vessel operating as part of the Venezuelan shadow fleet to traffic stolen oil and fund the narcoterrorist Maduro regime.\"",
      "In a statement on Saturday, the Venezuelan government condemned the vessel's seizure, saying it was a \"serious act of piracy.\"",
      "\"The colonialist model that the U.S. government seeks to impose through such practices will fail and be defeated by the Venezuelan people,\" the statement said.",
      "It added that \"these acts will not go unpunished,\" and that Venezuela \"will exercise all corresponding actions, including the complaint to the United Nations Security Council, other multilateral agencies and the governments of the world.\"",
      "President Trump last week called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or depart Venezuela. It is part of the ongoing pressure campaign against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.",
      "Earlier this month, sources told CBS News the U.S. military had\u00a0seized a sanctioned 20-year-old oil tanker that had just left port in Venezuela.",
      "Kevin Hasset, director of the White House's National Economic Council, said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the first two oil tankers seized were operating on the black market and providing oil to countries under sanctions.",

      "The targeting of tankers comes as Mr. Trump has ordered the Defense Department to carry out a series of attacks on vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean that his administration alleges are smuggling fentanyl and other illegal drugs into the U.S. At least 104 people have been killed in 28 known strikes since early September.",

      "At least 15 files that were released by the Justice Department Friday in relation to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were no longer available on the department's website on Saturday, CBS News has determined.",
      "CBS News downloaded the complete set of documents on Friday and compared it to what is available Saturday.",
      "It was unclear why the files are missing. CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department for comment.",
      "In a social media post to its X account Saturday night that seemed to touch on the issue, the DOJ wrote: \"Photos and other materials will continue being reviewed and redacted consistent with the law in an abundance of caution as we receive additional information.\"",
      "One of the missing files showed a mass of framed photos on a credenza desk. The photos showed former President Bill Clinton, and another was of the pope. In an open drawer, there was a photo of President Trump, Epstein, and Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell.",
      "On Sunday, the Justice Department said the Southern District of New York had flagged the image of the framed photos for potential further action to protect victims and it had been put back online.",
      "\"Out of an abundance of caution, the Department of Justice temporarily removed the image for further review,\" the Justice Department said in a statement. \"After the review, it was determined there is no evidence that any Epstein victims are depicted in the photograph, and it has been reposted without any alteration or redaction.\"",
      "Other missing files included photos of a room with what appeared to be a massage table and nude photos and nude paintings.",
      "The episode has deepened concerns that had already emerged from the Justice Department's much-anticipated document release. The tens of thousands of pages made public offered little new insight into Epstein's crimes or the prosecutorial decisions that allowed him to avoid serious federal charges for years, while omitting some of the most closely watched materials, including FBI interviews with victims and internal Justice Department memos on charging decisions.",
      "Some of the most consequential records expected about Epstein are nowhere to be found in the Justice Department's initial disclosures, which span tens of thousands of pages.",
      "Missing are FBI interviews with survivors and internal Justice Department memos examining charging decisions \u2014 records that could have helped explain how investigators viewed the case and why Epstein was allowed in 2008 to plead guilty to a relatively minor state-level prostitution charge.",
      "The records, required to be released under a recent law passed by Congress, hardly reference several powerful figures long associated with Epstein, including Britain's former Prince Andrew, renewing questions about who was scrutinized, who was not, and how much the disclosures truly advance public accountability",
      "Among the fresh nuggets: insight into the Justice Department's decision to abandon an investigation into Epstein in the 2000s, which enabled him to plead guilty to that state-level charge, and a previously unseen 1996 complaint accusing Epstein of stealing photographs of children.",
      "The releases so far have been heavy on images of Epstein's homes in New York City and the U.S. Virgin Islands, with some photos of celebrities and politicians.",
      "There was a series of never-before-seen photos of Clinton but fleetingly few of Mr. Trump. Both have been associated with Epstein, but both have since disowned those friendships. Neither has been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein and there was no indication the photos played a role in the criminal cases brought against him.",
      "Despite a Friday deadline set by Congress to make everything public, the Justice Department said it plans to release records on a rolling basis. It blamed the delay on the time-consuming process of obscuring survivors' names and other identifying information. The department has not given any notice when more records might arrive.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington. And this week on \"FACE THE NATION,\" the long-awaited release of the Epstein files. And will that good news about inflation improve America's views about President Trump's handling of the economy?",
      "President Trump is wrapping up the year with a tighter focus on the economy and affordability, both in the Oval Office and on the midterm's campaign trail, boasting of his 2025 accomplishments.",
      "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): This is a far better term than it would have been had I done it the most traditional way. It really is. It's more powerful term. It's a more powerful term. And the biggest news of all is yesterday it was announced that inflation is far lower than anybody expected. I told you.",
      "(END VIDEO CLIP)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's an exaggerated claim, but any sign of prices going lower is good news for Americans. Our new CBS poll shows that half the country says Trump's policies are making them financially worse off. We'll ask White House Chief Economic Advisor Kevin Hassett about that and more.",
      "Plus, a bipartisan conversation with the two members of Congress who pushed to pass the law calling for the Epstein files to be made public. Has the Trump administration obeyed that law? We'll talk about Kentucky Republican Tom Massie and California Democrat Ro Khanna.",
      "Finally, we'll talk with the head of UNICEF, Catherine Russell, about the children of Sudan and Gaza.",
      "It's all just ahead on \"FACE THE NATION.\"",
      "Good morning and welcome to \"FACE THE NATION.\"",
      "So far there have been few surprises in the tens of thousands of documents related to the case against convicted sex offender and accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein and his partner, convicted child sex offender Ghislaine Maxwell. The Justice Department says that 1,200 names identified as victims or their relatives were redacted, along with materials that could result in their identification. Will the release of the documents satisfy Congress and the political forces who lobbied for their disclosure and, much more importantly, will it satisfy the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein and their families?",
      "The two House members who pushed their colleagues into passing the bill to release these documents, Republican Thomas Massie, who's in Garrison, Kentucky, and Democrat Ro Khanna, who joins us this morning from Palo Alto, California.",
      "It's good to have you both of you here.",
      "I want to start with you, Congressman Massie, because in these past 48 hours we have seen the Justice Department acknowledge it's an incomplete release, but they have put out more than 13,000 files. They say more will come.",
      "This isn't everything you asked for just yet, but would you acknowledge that they are supplying with the spirit, if not the intent of your law?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE THOMAS MASSIE (R-KY): No, they're flouting the spirit and the letter of the law. It's very troubling, the posture that they've taken. And I won't be satisfied until the survivors are satisfied.",
      "You know, I said in the hours leading up to this release that we will know if they are complying if they implicate any of the other criminals that are involved in the \u2013 suspects that are involved. The witnesses, the victims themselves have given to the FBI, and they've never been mentioned.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there are some disclosures in here that seem new, Congressman Khanna. The documents confirm that the FBI received a complaint about Jeffrey Epstein back in 1996, but the woman whose name is Maria Farmer, who made the complaint, said federal officials failed to follow up. She said the disclosure makes her feel redeemed and that this was one of the best days of her life, to see these documents made public. What action do you want taken around a case like this?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA (D-CA): That was the single most important disclosure of what we got. I know Maria's sister, she sounded the alarm in 1996. She complained to the FBI. The problem is that Epstein was so connected with law enforcement and powerful politicians, the FBI did nothing for a decade. Frankly, she deserves compensation. She deserves an explanation.",
      "But the broader point is, Blanche was on this morning saying that Massie and I have a problem that it's taking too long. That's not the problem. The problem is, this was a slap in the face of survivors. What do they want? They want to know, who are the rich and powerful men who visited Epstein's rape island and covered up the abuse. And the key documents that our law basically said needed to be released, the 60-count indictment that actually implicates a lot of these people, and the prosecution memo were not released. It's not about the timeline, it's about the selective concealment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, yet, right, the deputy attorney general said there are more disclosures that will be made. You believe that they will not release that particular part? I mean you did give them some leeway for redactions.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, first of all, the redactions were excessive. And even Harvard Law professors who have looked at that have said you can't redact internal communications, you can't redact workforce product. And the courts are going to find that these were excessive.",
      "But my point, and I'm sure Congressman Massie can elaborate, is that we want the files out. So, if our sounding the alarm on what is missing is going to help them get those files out, fine. But this shouldn't be a big document dump. There's a pretty simple point, who raped these young girls, who covered it up and why are they getting away with it?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you are saying specific things regarding the indictment Congressman Massie, I saw in a video that you posted, you had a very specific benchmark of success here. You said you know there are at least 20 men accused of sex crimes known to the FBI. How do you know that number? And do you know those names?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE THOMAS MASSIE: Yes, the survivors lawyers have told me those numbers and they've described their professions in general. But they've only given me one of those name. And I mentioned that in a congressional hearing, Jeff Staley (ph). So, I searched these documents. I didn't see Jeff Staley's name. Nor did I see 19 other names.",
      "And here's why we shouldn't be optimistic that Blanche or Bondi are going to release these thing. They sent a six-page memo to Congress and said that \u2013 they cited pre-existing laws as reasons that they weren't going to follow our law. For instance, our law requires them to release information regardless of embarrassment. But they are trying to say that a previous law prevails when it doesn't. Common sense says it doesn't. The privacy act doesn't protect them from that. And then also, as Ro said, internal communication. Those \u2013 they're using a FOIA standard that doesn't apply because our law already says they have to give us internal communications.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. In terms of the gentleman there, you referenced as accused, I mean, being in the document doesn't necessarily prove criminal behavior, right? And in terms of the redactions, what the deputy attorney general said is that they were abiding by your law. And also a judge in New York had ordered them to listen to victims. So, they're claiming that information that they had initially even published Friday, they had to pull down because they were trying to protect victims. You aren't \u2013 you don't sound convinced that they are abiding by, you know, this intent.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE THOMAS MASSIE: No, actually \u2013 no, they are not abiding. And all three judges who released the grand jury materials said that our law trumps the prior law. That's just common sense. Law school 101. Yet, Todd Blanche is using a different theory that wouldn't survive first contact with any court, which is, he's trying to say that prior laws override our law. That's not the way this works.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. What are you going to do about it to force them to comply? I mean can you do anything?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE THOMAS MASSIE: Oh, absolutely. Look, people have talked about \u2013 and by the way, Todd Blanche is the face of this. But it's really the attorney general's office, Pam Bondi, who is responsible. And there are several ways to get at this. Some take longer. Some are shorter.",
      "The quickest way, and I think most expeditious way to get justice for these victims is to bring inherent contempt against Pam Bondi. And that doesn't require going through the courts. And give her \u2013 you know, and basically Ro Khanna and I are talking about and drafting that right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Well, I mean, on another network this morning Democratic Senator Tim Kaine said impeachment or contempt, it is premature, Congressman Khanna. And the depth attorney general said bring it on. They don't seem to be taking it very seriously. And if you just don't have the math in the Senate, including at least now this Democratic senator not being convinced, doesn't that sort of show that you're at the limit of pressure?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: No, we only need the House for inherent contempt. And we're building a bipartisan coalition. And it would fine Pam Bondi for every day that she's not releasing these documents.",
      "I'll tell you why \u2013 I've talked to the survivors, why this is such a slap in the face. One of the survivors said they released her name accidentally but they still have not released the FBI file about the people who abused her at her request. And the problem here is that there are rich and powerful people \u2013 we all know this, there are 1,200 victims, they're rich and powerful people who either engaged in this abuse, covered it up or were on this island. And what the American people want to know is, who are these people. And instead of holding them accountable, Pam Bondi is breaking the law. And this is the corrupt system, the Epstein class that people are sick of.",
      "So, I believe we're going to get bipartisan support in holding her accountable and a committee of Congress should determine whether these redactions are justified or not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's sometime in January when you all come back, I assume, that that will happen.",
      "I want to ask you, though, Congressman Khanna, there have been images released in the past 48 hours, some of them include former President Bill Clinton. There's at least one image of Donald Trump. I should say neither man has been accused of any wrongdoing related to Epstein, though they clearly knew him.",
      "But since Friday's publication \u2013 we're showing the image here now \u2013 one of the pictures was pulled down. There were 15 images total that were then redacted from the DOJ website. And it's kind of hard to see, but it's an open drawer with a photo of President Trump.",
      "Why do you think that was pulled down? Because the deputy attorney general says this was victims saying that their privacy or somehow their integrity was being compromised by having that image published.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, I'm less concerned about that photo. I don't know the facts. My concern is the major documents that we know are out there that haven't been released. The 60 count indictment that shows massive financial fraud and foreign interference. The prosecution memo. And look, they put out these Bill Clinton pictures \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Foreign interference?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, there are allegations that there are foreign governments that potentially were involved. And that all needs to come out. And it needs to come out in the indictments. It needs to come out in the prosecution memos.",
      "But the reality is, they put out these pictures of Bill Clinton. Fine, put it all out, but don't distract from the fundamental issue, which is, who are these powerful people who visited rape \u2013 rape island? I mean there are 1,200 victims. It defies common sense that it was just Epstein and Maxwell. And they're hiding something. And you know why the American people are so upset. My X account had MAGA supporters supporting me for the first time, saying, you know, Pam Bondi whiffed, according to Susan Wiles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: She is breaking the law. She needs to be held accountable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're referring to the \"Vanity Fair\" quote that the chief of staff gave, saying, the \"whiffed.\" And she said that Pam Bondi gave them \"binders full of nothingness.\" And then when it came to the client list she said it was on her desk, \"there is no client list,\" quote, \"and it sure as hell wasn't on her desk.\"",
      "Do you see that as an acknowledgment here though that the politics have overtaken the substance?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: No. For us it's about the survivors. And if you look at Thomas Massie and my comments the morning of the release, we were giving Todd Blanche the benefit of the doubt. We said if it's not all there, fine, just get the information out. It's when the survivors said that this is an insult, this is a slap in their face, that we aren't getting \u2013 the truth about who these men were on the \u2013 on rape island, that we started sounding the alarm. And this is more documents of nothingness.",
      "And I guess the question the American people have, even to me, is, is the system so corrupt, is the system so corrupt that Thomas Massie and you defy the odds, pass a bill through a discharge petition, get the Senate, get the president to sign it, and still these rich and powerful people are being protected. Who has this kind of hold on our government? What are they hiding? Why are they not releasing this?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you want, what, people involved in those initial investigations down in Florida reexamined and possibly prosecuted?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: I want the information out which was in that prosecution memo that Acosta disregarded, that were in those indictments. There were 60 counts against Epstein. Only two counts were prosecuted. I want to know, who were these other people who were on the Epstein's rape island, who were the people who saw young girls being paraded around at parties, 13, 14, 15-year-olds and didn't say anything, and why is it so hard when there's a law requiring these names to come out. What we're seeing is survivors' names come out but not the men who abuse them. And instead of \u2013 instead of holding elites accountable, Pam Bondi is break the law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will see when you gentlemen come back to work sometime in January what your next measures are. It sounds like you've made it clear you're moving action against the attorney general.",
      "Thank you both for your reaction today.",
      "\"FACE THE NATION\" will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the economy and our executive director of elections and surveys, Anthony Salvanto.",
      "Good morning. Good to have you here.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the president was speaking throughout the past week about the economy, even in this Oval Office address. He's trying to reframe public perception of what's going on. We know sentiment has been low for years now. Do people really expect that a president can fix everything in the first year?",
      "ANTONY SALVANTO: So, let me start with that big context because it's so important. Yes, through 2025 people have said they thought the economy was bad. When you talk about going back years, this goes back to before the pandemic was the last time that a majority of Americans said the economy was good. So, we are in this long and a lot of people think structural change that the economy has gone through. Things got more expensive coming out of the pandemic and people still are trying to adjust to those higher costs. That's what underpins all those sentiments.",
      "Now, the political part of this is coming into 2025 more people did think that Donald Trump would fix it. The expectations were high. We measured that back in January. Right now you have this less than one in five that feel like his policies have made them financially better off. And even when you ask people then to look ahead to 2026, it's a little bit better, but it's not overwhelming that people think his policies will make them better off.",
      "So, there's this real disconnect there. And if you come back to the description of the economy, people right now, I ask them to just grade it, and they give it a C, a D or even worse, which is different than a lot of the times the way the administration has described the economy. That sets up the fundamental challenge I think you saw that this week for \u2013 in the address.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, it's not a new tactic for a current president to blame the last one for all the problems of today. But we checked and in that primetime address the president said it was Biden's name, Biden's fault about seven times. Does the public buy that?",
      "ANTONY SALVANTO: Well, when you pick up on what we've just talked about, this long-term trend, the president did inherit economy where people thought \u2013 a majority of people thought it was bad. At the same time, right now more people say the current economy is Donald Trump's responsibility. He's the one, it's on his watch right now.",
      "Having said that, he had been declining on his handling of the economy throughout the year. That's leveled off now in recent weeks. And one thing you do find is, yes, there's this disconnect. People think he is describing it as better than it really is. Maybe there's political credit to be gained by starting to address what people are feeling.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, one thing we know is that health care costs for both private insurance users and government insurance users is going to be up. Congress is still debating what to do about the Obamacare act. But how much public focus is there on this issue?",
      "ANTONY SALVANTO: So, if you look at the most immediate part of that argument, a big majority thinks that Congress should extend those added subsidies. But in the wider context of this, when we asked people, how do you feel about trying to afford all these various aspects, these basics, cost of living, health care is one of the ones that stands out that a lot of people say they have trouble affording.",
      "And I think you're picking that up in the general sentiment of how people process health care, health insurance costs as well. It's a very important part, obviously, of people's budgets, but also one that they tell us that concerns them a whole lot.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, one of the structural changes you sort of alluded to earlier is the change coming from artificial intelligence. You were looking at this. We've seen a lot of discussion about how it's reshaping things. Are Americans sort of digesting that? How do they understand it?",
      "ANTONY SALVANTO: Yes, we've been following this all year because, right, it's driving stock market gains. There's a lot of investment in it as well.",
      "Right now you see a lot of uncertainty from the public about it. On one hand, when I ask people, what parts of the economic sectors are you most at least optimistic about? Technology stands out as people being optimistic about it in general. But with regard to A.I. in particular, more people tell us they think it's going to decrease jobs than increase them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the number of corporations forecasting a lot of spending on technology in the new year.",
      "What do all these dynamics mean politically for the midterm races in 2026?",
      "ANTONY SALVANTO: So, let me start with the president because one thing I asked heading into 2026, is there anything that the president could do to change your mind about them? And there are a substantial number of people that say, yes. Perhaps not surprisingly, when I follow and ask, well, what would that be about, they say it's the economy.",
      "The reason that's important is, in the dynamic here, a president is always key. He's not on the ballot, but he's always on people's minds in a midterm year. So, that's the first thing to watch. But the other one, you know, if you're at your holiday gathering and people are arguing about what's going to happen, who's going to win, I think it's too far to know for certain. But at the same time, we can already see the conditions and the playing field that people will be fighting on. And that's clearly cost of living. It's clearly health care, among other things. And it's the race to define how people evaluate it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony Salvanto, thank you for this.",
      "ANTONY SALVANTO: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to the director of the White House National Economic Council Kevin Hassett.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT (National Economic Council Director): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We took you literally. You said last Sunday you'd come back and talk to us about that household survey, the jobs picture. You said you really trust it. That report came out. It showed America added 64,000 jobs with unemployment ticking up to 4.6 percent.",
      "But we've seen analysis, including from the top economist at U.S. Navy Federal saying the U.S. is in a, quote, \"hiring recession. Very few jobs being added since the spring and wage gains are slowing.\" Are we in a hiring recession?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: No, I don't think so. I think that basically the number was about what the market expected. It was a number that was less than 100, which is a little bit lower than you'd like. But then, after that, we got the Consumer Price Index numbers, which were really amazing. And so, if you look at the three-month moving average of core consumer prices, then they're running at an annual rate of about 1.6 percent, way below the Fed's target.",
      "And my old friend all the way back to grad school, Austan Goolsbee, who's now one of the Fed governors voting on interest rates, conceded that they should have cut rates faster, and that he's going to do so in the future because of this inflation number.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. He was one of the dissenters when the Fed's decision came out.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when it comes to inflation, as you just referred to, that number showed there was still a rise in inflation. It was just at a slower pace than expected. If you pull out energy and pull out food, it rose at the slowest pace since 2021, up 2.6 percent in November from a year ago. But then there are quirks in here because it looks like the prices weren't gathered until Thanksgiving discounts kicked in. There was no increase reflected in terms of houses costs. Why do you trust the data now when you haven't in the past?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Oh, you know, I think that you're right to always be suspicious about data. And it will look a lot cleaner when we get a full survey, which we didn't have these \u2013 that time. But, you know, two of the three numbers, if we go back to the three month moving average, were fine. And so, I think that the error band around the 1.6 percent inflation, about that's the \u2013 the pace is running, is probably pretty tight. Surely there will be some revisions, but I think the numbers are about right.",
      "And I usually, Margaret, don't like to go to year over year when we're talking about what's going on with inflation because that includes a lot of high inflation Biden months in the back, and, you know, fewer and fewer as we get, you know, further into the year. But I think that the trajectory right now is best seen by the three month moving average. And that's below two, below the Fed target. So it means the Fed, as Austan Goolsbee said, has plenty of room to cut rates.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. But the president said inflation has stopped. You'd acknowledge that's an exaggeration.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, I guess the inflation being above the target has stopped for sure. And so inflation is not zero also. That's fair.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. He did not give those caveats. He just said, inflation has stopped.",
      "Kevin Hassett, stay with us. I've got to take a quick break and I want to talk about the rest of what we've learned.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: OK.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Stay with us.",

She's just back from Sudan.",

      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to \"FACE THE NATION.\"",
      "And we continue our conversation now with the director of the White House National Economic Council Kevin Hassett. This past week we saw the president announce further changes to immigration policy. He halted diversity visas. There are now 39 countries on this travel ban or restricted list. This is in addition to all the deportations and revocations of asylum.",
      "The business community has made clear that the constant changes make it hard for them to plan, particularly in small business categories. They're concerned about a labor shortage. And we've seen the U.S. workforce lose more than one million foreign-born workers in the past year. Are you hearing those concerns from the business community?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT (DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL): Actually, it's the opposite. So, in the sense that native born workers are up more than two million. And so what we've seen is that as foreign-born workers, and a lot of them, don't forget, were illegal immigrants that have been deported, when foreign-born workers depart, then it creates jobs for people who are native-born.",
      "The interesting thing too, which I'd like to remind everybody, is that native-born Americans aren't necessarily racially distinct at all. And so, the majority of the native-born jobs that have been created over the last year are Hispanic Americans. It's, you know, just basically taking folks that are legally in the country and getting the jobs to them is what we see in the data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Associated General Contractors of America didn't say they're replacing those workers easily. They're saying they're having a hard time doing that, and issued a statement saying it's a significant challenge, urging the administration to lock at ways to expand the construction workforce and allow more people to lawfully enter the country.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right. Well, one of the things we're seeing, this is exactly how markets work, right? So, construction workers, their salaries this year have gone up by $3,300 on average according to the latest report. And \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because of scarcity?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, but when the price goes up, then people say, oh, I should \u2013 I should go and I used to be a construction worker but now I'm doing something else, I should go back to construction work because the salaries are so high. And so we're seeing a lot of that go on. And so we're very bullish on construction and really happy to see that wages are going way back up.",
      "And so, instead of having, you know, basically illegal people come in and take jobs away from native-born Americans at low languages, we're seeing people re-enter the labor force at high wages.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to be clear, from the business community, part of the question is what is legal because you're changing the definition and pulling back asylum from some groups. So, there is confusion of the constant change in policy. Will there be clarity in the new year?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Oh, there will definitely be clarity in the new year. And I think there's clarity now that what we've done is that we've made it so that people are legally residents of the country and legally allowed to work, that they're, you know, basically top of the list when you're looking for somebody to hire.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you a bit about tariffs. Since as far back as July we have heard the president refer to this idea of $2,000 checks being given out to households. The treasury secretary said this would go to households making less than $100,000. Should Americans plan to receive those checks in 2026?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: That's going to depend on what happens with Congress. Congress is going to have to send those monies to those people. But the thing we can say is that since July we've had a lot of positive news about the economy. We've had a couple of quarters of almost four percent growth. We've got a big government surplus actually running for a few months in a row. The deficit relative to last year is down by $600 billion.",
      "And so, in the summer I wasn't so sure that there was space for a check like that, but now I'm pretty sure that there is. And so, I would expect that in the new year the president will bring forth a proposal to Congress to make that happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, a new proposal for these. It's not necessarily coming from existing tariff revenue?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Oh, well, it could come from tariff revenue. But in the end, you know, we get taxes, we get tariffs, we get all \u2013 revenue from lots of places, and then Congress decides how to spend those monies, that's an appropriation. It's \u2013 this would have to be money that would an appropriation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. So, don't bank on it, in other words.",
      "So, are you projecting that in the new year certain tariffs will remain in place, or do you see some of them going away?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I think that most of the tariffs that we passed this year have proven their metal. We've got still high growth, which people said we couldn't if we had tariffs. We have reduction in the deficit. Reduction in the trade deficit. Imports from China are the lowest they've been since China entered the WTO. So, there's a lot of success to crow about in the tariff space.",
      "But there are also thing that we're hearing when we talk to people, like trading partners and companies that trade a lot in the U.S., There are also things that maybe could be adjusted. You saw that we decided to exempt coffee, for example, because we don't make a lot of coffee in the U.S. And so I think that \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And coffee prices are up.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And I think that if there's something that's not made in the U.S. at all, that there's an appetite, and Jamieson Greer is leading the effort to study these matters, there's an appetite too exempt things if they're really not meant to be made in the U.S. because of, you know, like climate or things like that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've also go \u2013 got the Supreme Court decision pending in terms of the specific IEEPA, as they're called. These are tariffs where the justification was citing fentanyl, Canadian crude, some Chinese imports. If the Supreme Court doesn't find in your favor, who gets the refund? Is it the companies or is it the consumers? How does that work?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes, you know, we really expect the Supreme Court is going to find with us. And I also think that if they didn't find with us, then it's going to be pretty unlikely that they're going to call for widespread refunds because it would be an administrative problem to get those refunds out there. But basically, whoever paid the tariff, like actually cut the check to buy the thing, would be the person who would be getting the refund if there were one.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Doesn't the administration claim it was the country that paid that? You're saying the company?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: It would be \u2013 like I'm talking \u2013 I'm not talking about the incidents, right? The \u2013 like, so the incidents of the tariff, so in the end who pays the tariff depends on the elasticity of supply and demand. We know that China cut the price a lot so that the post-tariff price from Chinese goods is about what it was before the tariff. But the people who pay the tariff \u2013 if there is a refund, the people who actually paid for the good, the importer in most cases, they're the ones who would be the first line of defense for refunding the tariff.",
      "But I really, really don't think that's going to happen. It would be very complicated. And then that person would be responsible for allocating the tariff refund to the appropriate folks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That sounds like a mess.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes, it is a mess. And that's why I think the Supreme Court wouldn't do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Well, we'll wait and see.",
      "I want to quickly ask you about the oil market. I asked you last Sunday about that decision to seize a tanker off the coast of Venezuela. We saw yet another one over the weekend. You said last Sunday it probably won't affect oil prices to be taking this oil off the black market. Do you stand by that? And was all that oil going to China?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes. You know, I haven't been briefed on the latest. I did see that this is another ship that was basically operating on the black market. And so there have been a little bit \u2013 there's been a little bit of black market activity in the oil sector to go to sanctioned countries and to get them some oil. And they're getting that oil in order to avoid, you know, the reforms that we think would make the countries a better place. And so, it's not a lot of oil compared to world supply. And so, I don't think that people need to be worried here in the U.S. that the prices are going to go up because of these seizures of these ships. There's just a couple of them. And they were black market ships.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Were these sanctioned ships going to China?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I'm not sure where they were going.",

      "Good morning to you.",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL (Executive Director, UNICEF): Good morning, Margaret. How are you?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm well. But you are \u2013 we want to draw attention here to those in need. And I know Secretary of State Marco Rubio just, on Friday, called for a cessation of hostilities. He said the U.S. is pushing for a humanitarian truce to allow some of these aid organizations to operate, but aid convoys have been struck on their way in, he also acknowledged. What kind of challenges are you facing?",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: Well, Sudan is, at this moment, the largest humanitarian crisis we're facing. And there are many things happening there. One is that children in particular, but people are on the move. Millions of people are moving around the country. We have hunger, extreme hunger, including famine, designated in certain parts of the country. We're also seeing just horrific levels of violence, excuse me, including rape, including against children. UNICEF did a report about that about a year ago. Even children under the age of one. Absolutely terrible stories.",
      "And a woman I met in Chad, who had fled Darfur, told me about the effort to sort of rape women in front of their families and their communities. Really trying to terrorize them. And videotaping it to humiliate them. And so, the levels of violence are horrific. You have children out of school. So, the bottom line here is that the needs are enormous. The challenges are just absolutely staggering. And I think the world needs to come together, you know, in the short term for sure we need better humanitarian access. We need to reach all of these communities. That's hard to do right now.",
      "But the truth is, Margaret, that what I heard from children across Sudan was the same thing, which is, I would say to them, you know, what do you think about what do you want? And they all said the same thing, which is, we want peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: I think they understand that the only answer here really is to solve the political problems so that people can get back to some sort of a decent life.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I just \u2013 I don't want to let go what you just mentioned in terms of why something like that would be done to children and to women in front of their families. The term genocide is used in Sudan. What you are describing there in terms of treatment of gender-based violence, it sounds like you are saying, that is an attempt to destroy a society by carrying out rape.",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: I mean they are definitely atrocities that are intended to terrorize communities, to force them to move, to scare them. And, you know, they're effective strategies for sure. And I think, you know, the world needs to take a look \u2013 I mean Sudan, I know it seems so far away. And it is in many ways. But it is also a place where children are suffering so enormously. And I think especially, you know, now we're in the holiday season, you know, you want to think about, you know, people being with their families, all the rest of it. I mean children in so many places are not \u2013 are not having those sort of luxuries. They are really suffering. And I think the world needs to pay attention to that. And I commend, you know, Senator Rubio, Secretary Rubio now, for pointing this out because I think the key thing here is that we need attention to the problem.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the U.S. has historically been the largest donor to UNICEF. But we've seen tremendous cuts by this administration, including $142 million claw back of congressionally approved funds. Secretary Rubio said no one died from these aid cuts. And on Friday he said he's very proud of the changes that were made in foreign aid. Tell us what the realty is of the funding cuts.",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: Yes, the funding cuts are challenging. And I think that the issue to understand is it's not just the United States. It's almost every donor to \u2013 certainly to UNICEF but to the U.N. system broadly, and to humanitarian sector. And so when you add all of those together, the impacts are really dramatic because it means what, you know, what \u2013 what financial support we do get, we have to spread now over more places and with less support from donor countries.",
      "So, I think, you know, there are certainly, you know, there have been and will probably always be catastrophes that we're trying to deal with. And children are suffering. And the United States has always proudly led, I think, on humanitarian response and on helping children. And, you know, we're hopeful that some of the money that has been taken back will be restored to us. We continue to work with the State Department. There are efforts to fund a lot of the humanitarian and sort of life-saving work that we do. But really, you know, the needs around the world are just absolutely enormous. And it's the United States and other donors would have to come in behind that, along with the private sector, I have to add that. That is also an important piece of this puzzle.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. And I should point out that the U.S. is one of the largest foreign aid donors to South Sudan, but that foreign aid is also under threat at this moment because of the government not complying with what the U.S. is demanding.",
      "Let me quickly \u2013",

      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: Well, again, I would say thanks to the ceasefire and the administration here was critical in doing that, things have gotten a bit better. We are able to move around better.",
      "But, you know, there's tremendous misery. The challenges for me, we have a lot of work that needs to get done. I mean you've seen all of the images, the destruction. You know, we still have serious levels of malnutrition. We are trying to get shelter in place. You know, there's rain and just misery for children all around. So, I think, you know, would \u2013 I would say there definitely is progress with the ceasefire. God willing that holds.",

      "(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Father, I want to ask you about this role you have at the head of the Conference of Bishops. Last month there was this urgent message. It was a very rare statement addressing concern for the evolving situation impacting migrants. And the language was pretty sharp in it. Quote, \"we oppose the indiscriminate mass deportation of people. We pray for an end to dehumanizing rhetoric and violence, whether directed at immigrants or at law enforcement.\"",
      "What are bishops that you talk to seeing in perishes all around the country? What triggered this?",
      "ARCHBISHOP PAUL COAKLEY (President, U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops): I think it varies from place to place for sure. So, in communities with a more dense migrant population, there's a great deal of fear and uncertainty. Anxiety because of the level of rhetoric that is often employed when addressing usually around migration and the threats of deportation. So, there's a lot of anxiety. So, our pastors are trying to accompany people, walk with people, reassure people, and that's the message of the church. And that was the reason for our special message in November that we're with you, we hear you, we're aware of your suffering and your fears, and we fully intend to accompany you during this difficult time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I know there have been bishops in places like Charlotte, in parts of California, who have formally granted permission or dispensation is the word used for people who skip Sunday mass if they're afraid they could be targeted by ICE. Are you actually seeing a decline in the number of people attending mass because they're afraid they'll be arrested?",
      "ARCHBISHOP PAUL COAKLEY: We are not seeing that here in Oklahoma. And I haven't heard it reportedly widely from my brother bishops. So, I know that that is the case in some places. But I don't think it's as common, at least here locally, or in places that I have personal contact with. There's a \u2013 there's an anxiety, there's a fear. But I don't think it's kept people away in great numbers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, this video that you released really got a lot of attention. It certainly got ours. And it mentioned being troubled by threats against the sanctity of houses of worship, as well as hospitals and schools. You know, I spoke to the vice president, J.D. Vance, last year and asked him about this change in policy that would allow for ICE to enter churches and schools. And he really pushed back hard. He says that the catholic church receives funds to help re-settle immigrants, thus they are motivated by financial and not humanitarian reasons.",
      "Have you had any kind of conversation with the Trump administration, with the vice president, to explain what it is you're trying to say?",
      "ARCHBISHOP PAUL COAKLEY: I have not had any personal conversations at this point with either the president or the vice president. So, I look forward to engaging with them over matters of mutual concern and certainly undoubtedly the question of immigration is going to come up, I think. We have opportunities to work together. We have opportunities to speak frankly with one another. So, I will look forward to that in the \u2013 in the near future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the vice president calls himself a devout catholic, which is also why I ask. I mean do you \u2013 what do you say to Catholics like him who argue that these hardline immigration policies have had a result that they sought, that the end justifies the means?",
      "ARCHBISHOP PAUL COAKLEY: I don't think we can ever say that the end justifies the means. We have to treat everyone with respect. Respect of human dignity. Dignity of every person. There's no conflict necessarily between advocating for safe and secure borders and treating people with respect and dignity. We always have to treat people with dignity. God-given dignity. The state doesn't award it. And the state can't take it away. So, it's from the creator.",
      "So, I think, as Christians, as believers, we \u2013 that's kind of a foundational bedrock thing for us, that people are to be respected and treated with dignity, whether they are documented or undocumented, whether they are here legally or illegally, they don't forfeit their human dignity.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what is it that you think is causing that to be an issue right now? Why do you think that there is a loss of dignity? Are there specific policies that you are thinking of when you say that?",
      "ARCHBISHOP PAUL COAKLEY: Well, not necessarily. I mean I just \u2013 to treat people with respect. To afford them due process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "ARCHBISHOP PAUL COAKLEY: The deportations that are \u2013 that are happening around the country can \u2013 it's instilling, as I said, fear in a rather widespread manner. So, I think that's \u2013 that's something that concerns us all, that people have a \u2013 have a right to live in security and without fear of random and \u2013 of deportations. I think we're believers, of course, in due process. We have provisions in law that award due process to everyone. So, that's what we are wanting to emphasize.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What would you advise others, other people of faith, to do for these immigrants?",
      "ARCHBISHOP PAUL COAKLEY: Well, we are a nation of immigrants ourselves. So, I think that's something that we, as Americans, need to always come back to. We are founded upon the immigrant experience. So, I think we need to be generous in welcoming immigrants. We certainly have a right and a duty to respect borders of our nation. And I would say remind all of us that we have a right and a duty to respect sovereign borders of a state. But we also have a responsibility to welcome immigrants. This is kind of a fundamental principle in catholic social teaching regarding immigration and migration. People have a right to remain in their homeland, but they also ought to be allowed to migrate when conditions in their homeland are unsafe and necessitate moving to a place where they can find peace and security.",

    "summary": "Rep. Ro Khanna said the release of an initial tranche of files and photos related to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was a \"slap in the face of survivors,\" while Rep. Thomas Massie said the DOJ is \"flouting the spirit and the letter of the law.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Lawmakers who led the push to compel the release of the files related to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein criticized the Justice Department's release of an initial tranche of files and photos Sunday, advocating for survivors seeking more key documents about individuals involved in the abuse.",
      "Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California called the release a \"slap in the face of survivors.\"",
      "\"It's not about the timeline, it's about the selective concealment,\" Khanna said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "On Friday, the Justice Department began disclosing thousands of files, facing a deadline to release all the files in accordance with a law signed earlier this year. The files included new images of prominent figures and of Epstein's travels and various homes. They also include grand jury transcripts from the various cases brought against Epstein and his associates. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the Justice Department would continue to release the files over the next couple weeks.",
      "The disclosures sparked scrutiny from survivors and some lawmakers, who argue that the files should have been released in full by the Dec. 19 deadline.",
      "Khanna clarified that for him, the problem isn't \"that it's taking too long,\" but rather that the Justice Department hasn't hasn't released \"key documents\" that survivors are seeking that Khanna said implicate the \"rich and powerful men who visited Epstein's rape island and covered up the abuse.\"",
      "Khanna also called the redactions to the released files \"excessive.\" CBS News found that at least 550 pages in the initial release of the documents were fully redacted. The Justice Department has defended its release and claimed the redactions made were required by law.",
      "GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who appeared alongside Khanna on \"Face the Nation,\" said the Justice Department is \"flouting the spirit and the letter of the law.\"",
      "\"It's very troubling the posture that they've taken,\" Massie added. \"And I won't be satisfied until the survivors are satisfied.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department for comment and will update this story with any response.",
      "Friday's release came after years of pressure from lawmakers and survivors, which ramped up in recent months as they sought transparency around the government's investigations into Epstein after the Justice Department said in a July internal review that it found no \"client list.\" Khanna and Massie led the charge in Congress, earning support on a discharge petition to force a vote on a measure that compelled Attorney General Pam Bondi to release the files. President Trump signed the bill into law last month.",
      "Massie outlined the possible next steps Sunday, saying \"the quickest way, and I think most expeditious way, to get justice for these victims is to bring inherent contempt against Pam Bondi.\" The Kentucky Republican said he and Khanna are \"talking about and drafting that right now.\" Khanna added that the two men are \"building a bipartisan coalition, and it would fine Pam Bondi for every day that she's not releasing these documents.\"",
      "\"We want the files out.\" Khanna said. \"There's a pretty simple point: Who raped these young girls, who covered it up, and why are they getting away with it?\"",
      "Massie has pointed to 20 alleged co-conspirators, a number he said he heard from the survivors' lawyers. Massie said the lawyers have \"only given me one of those names,\" which he said during a congressional hearing in September was Jes Staley, the former CEO of Barclays Bank.

    "summary": "The Justice Department released thousands of new photos and records on Jeffrey Epstein on Friday, but at least 550 pages in the documents were fully redacted.",
    "story": [
      "The Justice Department released thousands of new records on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein on Friday, but at least 550 pages in the documents were fully redacted in the initial release, CBS News has found.",
      "The newly released files included photos of several prominent people in Epstein's orbit, images from his homes and investigative records that detail disturbing allegations against the late sex offender. But the heavy redactions in many of the records have drawn criticism from Democrats and some Republicans, as the department defends its handling of the files.",
      "One series of three consecutive documents \u2014 totaling 255 pages \u2014 is entirely redacted, with each page covered by a black box. A fourth 119-page document labeled \"Grand Jury-NY\" is also entirely redacted.",
      "At least 180 blacked-out pages appear in files that are mostly but not entirely redacted. In some cases, a cover page, a\u00a0photo of a folder\u00a0or\u00a0something else that isn't fully redacted\u00a0precedes several pages that are entirely obscured by a black box.",
      "The Justice Department said on X a largely unredacted version of the 119-page document was included in another tranche of files that were released on Saturday. The document is a transcript from the grand jury proceedings involving Epstein's convicted co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell.",
      "It's unclear if any other documents that were mostly or entirely redacted on Friday were released in an unredacted form Saturday. CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department for more details but did not immediately receive a response.",
      "\"Documents and photos will continue to be reviewed consistent with the law and with an abundance of caution for victims and their families,\" the Justice Department said Sunday.",
      "In other cases, the redactions were more sparing. For example, a 96-page police report on a Florida investigation into Epstein in the mid-2000s redacts the names of victims and other details, but leaves many other details in. The 119-page grand jury transcript that was published Saturday takes out names and identifying information, but leaves in almost everything else.",
      "And some of the thousands of photos included in Friday's release are partially redacted, with some people's faces obscured by boxes. Photos that include former President Bill Clinton, pop star Michael Jackson and other notable people have partial redactions (though Clinton and Jackson themselves are fully visible).",
      "Why was the DOJ allowed to redact Epstein files?",
      "The Epstein Files Transparency Act, passed by Congress last month, requires the Justice Department to release the files in its possession related to Epstein and Maxwell.",
      "Redactions are allowed for a handful of reasons, including to protect survivors' personal information and to leave out violent photos and child sexual abuse material. Documents can also be withheld in a \"narrowly tailored and temporary\" manner if their release would \"jeopardize an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution.\"",
      "Some of Friday's redactions appear to black out the names of survivors, but it's not clear in every case why information was blacked out. The government is required to give Congress a list of redactions within 15 days.",
      "The law explicitly forbids the government from withholding records due to the risk of \"embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity.\" The Justice Department said on X that no politicians' names were redacted from the files.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in a letter to Congress earlier Friday that a team of more than 200 Justice Department lawyers scoured the documents in search of survivors' names and other things that needed to be redacted. He said the department is still going through the files and will release more of them on a \"rolling basis,\" though the law required them to be released by Friday.",
      "Blanche's letter also said \"additional layers of review\" were necessary when reviewing grand jury transcripts. Judges in New York and Florida have given the government permission to release grand jury transcripts from Epstein's and Maxwell's cases, but the judge overseeing the Maxwell case required the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan to \"personally certify\" that none of the documents contain victims' personal information.",
      "Democrats criticize the redactions in Epstein files",
      "Some lawmakers have blasted the Justice Department for the redactions and for acknowledging that some documents will be released later.",
      "Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who helped lead the effort to pass the Epstein Files Transparency Act, argued that Friday's document release wasn't in compliance with their law.",
      "Khanna called it an \"incomplete release with too many redactions\" in a video posted to X. He said he's \"exploring all options,\" including impeachment or referrals for prosecution. Massie said the release \"grossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said: \"Simply releasing a mountain of blacked out pages violates the spirit of transparency and the letter of the law. For example, all 119 pages of one document were completely blacked out. We need answers as to why.\"",
      "The Justice Department has defended its handling of the files. Blanche told Fox News Digital: \"The only redactions being applied to the documents are those required by law \u2014 full stop.\"",
      "\"Democrat administrations in the past have refused to provide full details of the Jeffrey Epstein saga,\" Blanche said in his letter to lawmakers. \"But President Trump, Attorney General Bondi, and FBI Director Patel are committed to providing full transparency consistent with the law.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Dec. 21, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to the Director of the White House National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, good morning to you.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT, DIRECTOR NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We took you literally. You said last Sunday you'd come back and talk to us about that household survey, the jobs picture. You said you really trust it. That report came out. It showed America added 64,000 jobs, with unemployment ticking up to 4.6%. But we've seen analysis, including from the top economist at us, navy, federal, saying the US is in a quote, hiring recession. Very few jobs being added since the spring, and wage gains are slowing. Are we in a hiring recession?",
      "HASSETT: No, I don't think so. I think that basically, the number was about what the market expected. It was a number that was less than 100 which is a little bit lower than you'd like. But then after that, we got the consumer price index numbers, which were really amazing. And so if you look at the three month moving average of core consumer prices, then they're running at an annual rate of about 1.6% way below the Fed's target. And my old friend, all the way back to grad school, Austin Goolsby, is now one of the Fed governors voting on interest rates, conceded that they should have cut rates faster and that he's going to do so in the future because of this inflation number.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He was one of the dissenters when the Fed's decision came out. But when it comes to inflation, as you just referred to, that number showed there was still a rise in inflation, it was just at a slower pace than expected. If you pull out energy and pull out food, it rose at the slowest pace since 2021 up 2.6% in November from a year ago. But then there are quirks in here, because it looks like the prices weren't gathered until Thanksgiving discounts kicked in. There was no increase reflected in terms of housing costs. Why do you trust the data now, when you haven't in the past?",
      "HASSETT: Oh, you know, I think that you're right to always be suspicious about data, and it'll look a lot cleaner when we get a full survey, which we didn't have this time. But you know, two of the three numbers, if we go back to the three month moving average, we're fine. And so I think that the error band around the 1.6% inflation, about that's the pace it's running is probably pretty tight. Surely there will be supervisions, but I think the numbers are about right, and I usually, Margaret, don't like to go to year over year when we're talking about what's going on with inflation, because that includes a lot of high inflation Biden months in the back, and fewer and fewer as we get further into the year. But I think that the trajectory right now is best seen by the three month moving average, and that's below two, below the Fed target. So it means the Fed, as Austan Goolsbee said, has plenty of room to cut rates.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the President said inflation has stopped. You'd acknowledge that's an exaggeration.",
      "HASSETT: Well, I guess the inflation being above the target has stopped, for sure, and so, but inflation is not zero Also, that's fair.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, he did not give those caveats. He just said inflation has stopped. But Kevin, Kevin Hassett, stay with us. I've got to take a quick break, and I want to talk about the rest of what we've learned. On the other side of it. We've got more questions. Stay with us.",
      "PART 1 ENDS",
      "PART 2 STARTS",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face The Nation, and we continue our conversation now with the Director of the White House National Economic Council Kevin Hassett. This past week, we saw the President announce further changes to immigration policy. He halted diversity visas. There are now 39 countries on this travel ban or restricted list. This is in addition to all the deportations and revocations of asylum. The business community has made clear that the constant changes make it hard for them to plan, particularly in the small business category. They're concerned about a labor shortage and we've seen the U.S. workforce lose more than 1 million foreign-born workers in the past year. Are you hearing those concerns from the business community?",
      "HASSETT: Actually, it's the opposite. So in the sense that native-born workers are up more than 2 million. And so what we've seen is that as foreign-born workers, and a lot of them, don't forget, were illegal immigrants that have been deported, that when foreign-born workers depart, then it creates jobs for people who are native-born. The interesting thing too, which I'd like to remind everybody, is that native-born Americans aren't necessarily racially distinct at all.\u00a0 And so the majority of the native-born jobs that have been created over the last year are Hispanic Americans. It's, you know, just basically taking folks that are legally in the country and getting the jobs to them is what we see in the data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well the Associated General Contractors of America didn't say they're replacing those workers easily. They're saying they're having a hard time doing that, and issued a statement saying it's a significant challenge, urging the administration to look at ways to expand the construction workforce and allow more people to lawfully enter the country.",
      "HASSETT: Right. Well, one of the things we're seeing, this is exactly how markets work. Right? So construction workers, their salaries this year have gone up by $3,300 on average, according to the latest report --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Because the scarcity?",
      "HASSETT: Well, but when the price goes up, then people say, oh, I should go and I used to be a construction worker, but now I'm doing something else. I should go back to construction work because the salaries are so high. And so we're seeing a lot of that go on. And so we're very bullish on construction, and really happy to see that wages are going way back up. And so instead of having, you know, basically illegal people come in and take jobs away from native-born Americans at low wages, we're seeing people reenter the labor force at high wages.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to be clear from the business community part of the question is\u00a0 what is legal? Because you're changing the definition and pulling back asylum from some groups. So there's confusion at the constant change in policy. Will there be clarity in the new year?",
      "HASSETT: Oh, there will definitely be clarity in the new year. And I think there's clarity now that what we've done is that we've made it so that people are legally residents of the country and legally allowed to work, that they're, you know, basically top of the list when you're looking for somebody to hire.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you a bit about tariffs. Since as far back as July, we have heard the president refer to this idea of $2,000 checks being given out to households. The Treasury secretary said this would go to households making less than $100,000. Should Americans plan to receive those checks in 2026?",
      "HASSETT: That's going to depend on what happens with Congress. Congress is going to have to send those money to those peoples. But the thing we can say is that since July, we've had a lot of positive news about the economy. We've had a couple of quarters of almost 4% growth. We've got a big government surplus actually running for a few months in a row. The deficit relative to last year, is down by $600 billion and so in the summer, I wasn't so sure that there was space for a check like that, but now I'm pretty sure that there is, and so I would expect that in the new year, the President will bring forth a proposal to Congress to make that happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So a new proposal for these, it's not necessarily coming from existing tariff revenue?",
      "HASSETT: Well, it could come from from tariff revenue, but in the end, you know, we get taxes, we get tariffs, we get revenue from lots of places, and then Congress decides how to spend those monies. That's an appropriation. And so this would have to be money that would be an appropriation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So don't bank on it, in other words. So are you projecting that in the new year certain tariffs will remain in place, or do you see some of them going away?",
      "HASSETT: I think that most of the tariffs that we've passed this year have proven their mettle. We've got still high growth, which people said we couldn't if we had tariffs. We have reduction in the deficit. Reduction in the trade deficit. Imports from China are the lowest they've been since China entered the WTO. So there's a lot of success to crow about in the tariff space. But there are also things that we're hearing when we talk to people like trading partners and companies that trade a lot in the U.S.. There are also things that maybe could be adjusted. You saw that we decided to exempt coffee, for example, because we don't make a lot of coffee in the U.S.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --And coffee prices are up.",
      "HASSETT: And I think that if there's something that's not made in the U.S. at all, that there's an appetite, and Jamieson Greer is leading the effort to study these matters, that there's an appetite to exempt things if they're really not meant to be made in the U.S. because of, you know, like climate or things like that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've also go got the Supreme Court decision pending in terms of the specific IEEPA, as they're called, these are tariffs where the justification was citing fentanyl, Canadian crude, some Chinese imports. If the Supreme Court doesn't find in your favor, who gets the refund? Is it the companies, or is it the consumers? How does that work?",
      "HASSETT: Yeah, we really expect the Supreme Court is going to find with us, and I also think that if they didn't find with us, that it's going to be pretty unlikely that they're going to call for widespread refunds, because it would be an administrative problem to get those refunds out to there. But basically, whoever paid the tariff, like, actually cut the check to buy the thing, would be the person who would be getting the refund, if there were one.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Doesn't the administration claim it was the country that paid that? You're saying the company.",
      "HASSETT: It would be- like, I'm not talking about the incidence, right? That like, so the incidence of the tariff. So in the end, who pays the tariff depends on elasticities of supply and demand, and we know that China cut the price a lot, so that the post tariff price from Chinese goods is about what it was before the tariff. But the people who pay the tariff, if there is a refund, the people who actually paid for the good, the importer, in most cases, they're the ones who would be the first line of defense for refunding the tariff. But I really, really don't think that's going to happen, it'd be very complicated. And then that person would be responsible for allocating the tariff refund to the appropriate folks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That sounds like a mess.",
      "HASSETT: Yes, it is a mess, and that's why I think the Supreme Court wouldn't do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll wait and see. I want to quickly ask you about the oil market. I asked you last Sunday about that decision to seize a tanker off the coast of Venezuela. We saw yet another one over the weekend. You said last Sunday, it probably won't affect oil prices to be taking this oil off the black market. Do you stand by that? And was all that oil going to China?",
      "HASSETT: Yeah, you know, I haven't been briefed on the latest. I did see that this is another ship that was basically operating in the black market. And so there have been a little bit, there's been a little bit of black market activity in the oil sector to go to sanctioned countries and to get them some oil. And they're getting that oil in order to avoid the reforms that we think would make countries a better place. And so it's not a lot of oil compared to world supply. And so I don't think that people need to be worried here in the U.S. that the prices are going to go up because of these seizures of these ships. There's just a couple of them, and they were black market ships.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Were these sanctioned ships going to China?",
      "HASSETT: I'm not sure where they were going.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Kevin Hassett, thank you for your time--",
      "HASSETT: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have a great holiday. We'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Paul S. Coakley, President of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and Oklahoma City Archbishop, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Dec. 21, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Father, I want to ask you about this role you have at the head of the conference of bishops. Last month, there was this urgent message. It was a very rare statement addressing concern for the evolving situation impacting migrants, and the language was pretty sharp in it. Quote, \"We oppose the indiscriminate mass deportation of people. We pray for an end to dehumanizing rhetoric and violence, whether directed at immigrants or at law enforcement.\" What are bishops that you talk to seeing in parishes all around the country? What triggered this?",
      "ARCHBISHOP PAUL COAKLEY: I think it varies from place to place, for sure. So in communities with a more dense migrant population, there is a great deal of fear and uncertainty, anxiety because of the level of rhetoric that is- that is often employed when addressing issues around migration and the threats of deportation. So there's a lot of anxiety, so our pastors are trying to accompany people, walk with people, reassure people, and that's the message of the Church. And that was the reason for our special message in November, that we're with you. We hear you, we're aware of your suffering or your fears, and we fully intend to accompany you during this difficult time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I know there have been bishops in places like Charlotte, in parts of California, who have formally granted permission, or dispensation is the word used, for people to skip Sunday mass if they're afraid they could be targeted by ICE. Are you actually seeing a decline in the number of people attending mass because they're afraid they'll be arrested?",
      "ARCHBISHOP PAUL COAKLEY: We're not seeing that here in in Oklahoma. And I haven't heard it reported widely from my brother bishops. So I know that that is the case in some, some places, but I don't think it's as common, at least here locally or in places that I have personal contact with. There's a- there's an anxiety, there's a fear, but I don't think it's kept people away in great numbers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, this video that you released really got a lot of attention. It certainly got ours, and it mentioned being troubled by threats against the sanctity of houses of worship as well as hospitals and schools. You know, I spoke to the Vice President JD Vance last year and asked him about this change in policy that would allow for ICE to enter churches and schools. And he really pushed back hard. He says that the Catholic Church receives funds to help resettle immigrants. Thus they are motivated by financial and not humanitarian reasons. Have you had any kind of conversation with the Trump administration, with the Vice President to explain what it is you're trying to say?",
      "ARCHBISHOP PAUL COAKLEY: I have not had any personal conversations at this point with either the president or the vice president, so I look forward to engaging with them over matters of mutual concern, and certainly, undoubtedly the question of immigration is going to come up. I think we have opportunities to work together. We have opportunities to speak frankly with one another, so I will look forward to that in the near future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well the Vice President calls himself a devout Catholic, which is also why I ask. I mean, do you- what do you say to Catholics like him who argue that these hard line immigration policies have had a result that they sought, that the end justifies the means.",
      "ARCHBISHOP PAUL COAKLEY: I don't think we can ever say that the end justifies the means. We have to treat everyone with respect, respect of the human dignity, dignity of every person. There is no conflict necessarily between advocating for safe and secure borders and treating people with respect and dignity. We always have to treat people with, with dignity, God-given dignity. The state doesn't award it, and the state can't take it away. So it's, it's from the Creator. So I think as Christians, as believers, we- that's kind of a foundational bedrock thing for us, that people are to be respected and treated with dignity, whether they are documented or undocumented, whether they are here legally or illegally, they don't forfeit their human dignity.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what is it that you think is causing that to be an issue right now? Why do you think that there is a loss of dignity? Are there specific policies that you are thinking of when you say that?",
      "ARCHBISHOP PAUL COAKLEY: Well, not necessarily. I mean, I- just to treat people with respect, to afford them due process. The deportations that are, that are happening around the country can- it's instilling, as I said, fear in a rather widespread manner. So I think that's, that's something that concerns us all, that people have a- have a right to live in, in security and without fear of random and deportations. I think we're believers, of course, in due process. We have provisions in law that award due process to, to everyone. So that's what we are wanting to emphasize.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What would you advise others, other people of faith, to do for these immigrants?",
      "ARCHBISHOP PAUL COAKLEY: Well, we are a nation of immigrants ourselves. So I think that's something that we as Americans need to always come back to. We are founded upon the immigrant experience. So I think we need to be generous in welcoming immigrants. We certainly have a right and a duty to respect borders of our nation. And I would say, remind all of us that we have a right and a duty to respect sovereign borders of a state, but, but we also have a responsibility to welcome migrants. This is kind of a fundamental principle in, in Catholic social teaching regarding immigration and migration. People have a right to to remain in their homeland, but, but they also ought to be allowed to migrate when conditions in their homeland are unsafe and necessitate moving to a place where they can find peace and security.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Archbishop Paul Coakley of Oklahoma City, thank you for your time today.",
      "ARCHBISHOP COAKLEY: Thank you. Thank you very much.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Dec. 21, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: UNICEF warns that more than 200 million children will require humanitarian assistance in the coming year. The largest crisis right now is Sudan. Catherine Russell, UNICEF's Executive Director is just back from Sudan and South Sudan. Good morning to you.",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: Good morning, Margaret, how are you?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm well, but you are- we want to draw attention here to those in need. And I know Secretary of State Marco Rubio, just on Friday, called for a cessation of hostilities. He said the U.S. is pushing for humanitarian truce to allow some of these aid organizations to operate. But aid convoys have been struck on their way in, he also acknowledged. What kind of challenges are you facing?",
      "RUSSELL: Well, Sudan is, at this moment, the largest humanitarian crisis we're facing. And there are many things happening there. One is that children, in particular, but people are on the move. Millions of people are moving around the country. We have hunger, extreme hunger, including famine designated in certain parts of the country. We're also seeing just horrific levels of violence- excuse me, including rape, including against children. UNICEF did a report about that about a year ago, even children under the age of one. Absolutely terrible stories. And a woman I met in Chad who had fled Darfur told me about the effort to sort of rape women in front of their families and their communities, really trying to terrorize them and videotaping it to humiliate them. And so the levels of violence are horrific. We have children out of school. So the bottom line here is that the needs are enormous. The challenges are just absolutely staggering. And I think the world needs to come together. You know, in the short term, for sure, we need better humanitarian access. We need to reach all of these communities, \u00a0that's hard to do right now. But the truth is Margaret that what I heard from children across Sudan was the same thing, which is, I would say to them, you know, what do you think about? What do you want? And they all said the same thing, which is, we want peace. I think they understand that the only answer here, really, is to solve the political problems so that people can get back to some sort of a decent life.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I just, I don't want to let go what you just mentioned, in terms of why something like that would be done to children and to women in front of their families. The term genocide is used in Sudan. What you are describing there in terms of treatment of gender based violence, it sounds like you are saying that is an attempt to destroy a society by carrying out rape.",
      "RUSSELL: I mean, there are definitely atrocities that are intended to terrorize communities, to force them to move, to scare them. And you know, they're effective strategies for sure. And I think you know the world needs to take a look. I mean, Sudan, I know it seems so far away, and it is in many ways, but it is also a place where children are suffering so enormously. And I think especially, you know, now we're in the holiday season, you know, you want to think about, you know, people being with their families all the rest of it. I mean, children in so many places are not- are not having those sort of luxuries. They are really suffering. And I think the world needs to pay attention to that. And I commend, you know, Senator Rubio- Secretary Rubio, now for pointing this out, because I think the key thing here is that we need attention to the problem.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the U.S. has historically been the largest donor to UNICEF, but we've seen tremendous cuts by this administration, including a $142 million claw back of congressionally approved funds. Secretary Rubio said no one died from these aid cuts, and on Friday, he said he's very proud of the changes that were made in foreign aid. Tell us what the reality is of the funding cuts.",
      "RUSSELL: The funding cuts are challenging. And I think the issue to understand is it's not just the United States. It's almost every donor to- certainly to UNICEF, but to the UN system broadly, and to the humanitarian sector. And so when you add all of those together, the impacts are really dramatic, because it means that you know what- what financial support we do get, we have to spread now over- over more places, and with less support from- from donor countries. So I think you know there are, certainly, you know, there have been and will probably always be catastrophes that we're trying to deal with, and children are suffering. The United States has always proudly led, I think, on humanitarian response and on helping children. And, you know, we're hopeful that some of the money that has been taken back will be restored to us. We continue to work with the State Department. There are efforts to fund a lot of the humanitarian and sort of life saving work that we do. But really, you know, the needs around the world are just absolutely enormous, and it's the United States and other donors who have to come in behind that, along with the private sector, I have to add that that is also important.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I should point out that the U.S. is one of the largest foreign aid donors to South Sudan, but that foreign aid is also under threat at this moment because of the government not complying with what the U.S. is demanding. Let me quickly--",
      "RUSSELL: --South Sudan is a challenge. I was just there too, and that is, you know, the government there needs to do a better job",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Quickly before I let you go. Gaza, how are things improving?",
      "RUSSELL: Well, again, I would say, thanks to the ceasefire and the administration here was critical on doing that, things have gotten a bit better. We are able to move around better. But, you know, there's tremendous misery. The challenges remain. We have a lot of work that needs to get done. I mean, you've seen all of the images, the destruction. You know, we still have serious level- levels of malnutrition. We are trying to get shelter in place. You know, there's rain and just misery for children all around. So I think, you know, I would say there definitely is progress with the ceasefire. God willing that holds, and then we can continue to get more and more aid in there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: God willing that holds, as you say. Catherine Russell, thank you for your time today. We'll be back in a moment.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Reps. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Dec. 21, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We are joined now by two House members who pushed their colleagues into passing the bill to release these documents. Republican Thomas Massie, who is in Garrison, Kentucky, and Democrat Ro Khanna, who joins us this morning from Palo Alto, California. It's good to have both of you here. I want to start with you, Congressman Massie, because in these past 48 hours, we have seen the Justice Department acknowledge it's an incomplete release, but they have put out more than 13,000 files. They say more will come. This isn't everything you asked for just yet, but would you acknowledge that they are complying with this spirit, if not the intent of your law?",
      "REP. THOMAS MASSIE: No, they're flouting the spirit and the letter of the law. It's very troubling the posture that they've taken. And I won't be satisfied until the survivors are satisfied. You know, I said in the hours leading up to this release that we will know if they are complying, if they implicate any of the other criminals that are involved and the suspects that are involved. The witnesses this- the victims themselves, have given to the FBI, and they've never been mentioned.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there are some disclosures in here that seem new. Congressman Khanna. The documents confirm that the FBI received a complaint about Jeffrey Epstein back in 1996 but the woman, whose name is Maria Farmer who made that complaint, said federal officials failed to follow up. She said the disclosure makes her feel redeemed, and that this was one of the best days of her life to see these documents made public. What action do you want taken around a case like this?",
      "REP. RO KHANNA: That was the single most important disclosure of what we got. I know Maria's sister. She sounded the alarm in 1996, she complained to the FBI. The problem is that Epstein was so connected with law enforcement and powerful politicians, the FBI did nothing for a decade. Frankly, she deserves compensation. She deserves an explanation, but the broader point is, Blanche was on this morning saying that Massie and I have a problem, that it's taking too long. That's not the problem. The problem is, this was a slap in the face of survivors. What do they want? They want to know who are the rich and powerful men who visited Epstein's rape island and covered up the abuse and the key documents that our law basically said needed to be released. The 60-count indictment that actually implicates a lot of these people and the prosecution memo were not released. It's not about the timeline, it's about the selective concealment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, yet. Right? The Deputy Attorney General said there are more disclosures that will be made. You believe that they will not release that particular part? You did give them some leeway for redactions.",
      "REP. KHANNA: Well, first of all, the redactions were excessive. And even Harvard Law professors who have looked at that have said, you can't redact internal communications, you can't redact workforce product, and the courts are going to find that these were excessive. But my point, and I'm sure Congressman Massie can elaborate, is that we want the files out. So if our sounding the alarm on what is missing is going to help them get those files out, fine. But this shouldn't be a big document dump. There's a pretty simple point, who raped these young girls who covered it up, and why are they getting away with it?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're saying specific things regarding the indictment. Congressman Massie, I saw in a video that you posted, you had a very specific benchmark of success here. You said, you know there are at least 20 men accused of sex crimes known to the FBI. How do you know that number? And do you know those names?",
      "REP. MASSIE: Yeah, the survivors' lawyers have told me those numbers, and they've described their professions and in general, but they've only given me one of those names, and I mentioned that in a congressional hearing, Jess Staley. So I searched these documents, I didn't see Jess Staley's name, nor did I see 19 other names. And here's why we shouldn't be optimistic that Blanche or Bondi are going to release these things. They sent a six page memo to Congress and said- they cited pre-existing laws as reasons that they weren't going to follow our law. For instance, our law requires them to release information regardless of embarrassment, but they are trying to say that a previous law prevails when it doesn't. Common sense says it doesn't, the Privacy Act doesn't protect them from that. And then also, as Ro said, internal communications those they're using a FOIA standard that doesn't apply because our law already says they have to give us internal communications",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of the gentleman there you referenced as accused. I mean being in the document doesn't necessarily prove criminal behavior right? In terms of the redactions, what the Deputy Attorney General said is that they were abiding by your law, and also a judge in New York had ordered them to listen to victims. So they're claiming that information that they had initially even published Friday they had to pull down because they were trying to protect victims. You aren't- you don't sound convinced that they are abiding by, you know, this intent?",
      "REP. MASSIE: No, they are not abiding. And all three judges who released the grand jury material said that our law trumps the prior law. That's just common sense. Law school 101. Yet Todd Blanche is using a different theory that wouldn't survive first contact with any court, which is he's trying to say that prior laws override our law. That's not the way this works.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN : Okay, what are you going to do about it, to force them to comply? I mean, can you do anything?",
      "REP. MASSIE: Oh, absolutely. Look, people have talked about- and by the way, Todd Blanche is the face of this, but it's really the Attorney General's Office, Pam Bondi, who is responsible. And there are several ways to get at this. Some take longer. Some are shorter. The quickest way, and I think most expeditious way, to get justice for these victims is to bring inherent contempt against Pam Bondi, and that doesn't require going through the courts and give her and, and- basically Ro Khanna and I are talking about and drafting that right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, well, I mean, on another network this morning, Democratic Senator Tim Kaine said, impeachment or contempt, it is premature, Congressman Khanna. And the Deputy Attorney General said, \"bring it on.\" They don't seem to be taking this very seriously. And if you just don't have the math in the Senate, including, at least now this Democratic senator not being convinced, doesn't that sort of show that you're at the limit of pressure?",
      "REP. KHANNA: No, we only need the House for inherent contempt, and we're building a bipartisan coalition, and it would fine Pam Bondi for every day that she's not releasing these documents. I'll tell you why, I've talked to the survivors, why this is such a slap in the face. One of the survivors said they released her name accidentally, but they still have not released the FBI file about the people who abused her at her request. And the problem here is that there are rich and powerful people. We all know this. There are 1,200 victims. They're rich and powerful people who either engaged in this abuse, covered it up or were on this island. And what the American people want to know is, who are these people? And instead of holding them accountable, Pam Bondi is breaking the law. And this is the corrupt system, the Epstein class that people are sick of. So I believe we're going to get bipartisan support in holding her accountable, and a committee of Congress should determine whether these redactions are justified or not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sometime in January, when you all come back. I assume that- that will happen. I want to ask you though Congressman Khanna, there have been images released in the past 48 hours. Some of them include former President Bill Clinton. There's at least one image of Donald Trump. I should say neither man has been accused of any wrong doing related to Epstein, though they clearly knew him. But since Friday's publication, we're showing the image here now. One of the pictures was pulled down. There were 15 images total that were then redacted from the DOJ website. And it's-\u00a0 it's kind of hard to see, but it's an open drawer with a photo of President Trump. Why do you think that was pulled down? Because the Deputy Attorney General says this was victims saying that their privacy or somehow their integrity was being compromised by having that image published.",
      "REP. KHANNA: Well, I'm less concerned about that photo. I don't know the facts. My concern is the major documents that we know are out there that haven't been released, the 60-count indictment that shows massive financial fraud and foreign interference, the prosecution memo and look--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Foreign interference?--",
      "REP. KHANNA: --They put out these Bill Clinton pictures- Well, they- there are allegations that there are foreign governments that potentially were involved. And that all needs to come out. And it needs to come out in the indictments, it needs to come out in the prosecution memos. But the reality is, they put out these pictures for Bill Clinton. Fine, put it all out. But don't distract from the fundamental issue, which is, who are these powerful people who were visited rape- the rape island? I mean, they're 1200 victims. It defies common sense that it was just Epstein and- and Maxwell, and they're hiding something. And you know why the American people are so upset? My X account had MAGA supporters supporting me for the first time, saying, you know, Pam Bondi whiffed, according to Susan Wiles, she is breaking the law. She needs to be held accountable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're referring to the Vanity Fair quote that the chief of staff gave, saying the \"whiffed,\" and she said that Pam Bondi gave them \"binders full of nothingness.\" And then when it came to the client list, she said it was on her desk. \"There is no client list,\" quote \"and it sure as hell wasn't on her desk.\" Do you see that as an acknowledgement here, though, that, that the politics have overtaken the substance?",
      "REP. KHANNA: No, for us, it's about the survivors. And if you look at Thomas Massie and my comments, the morning of the release, we were giving t- Blanche the benefit of the doubt. We said, if it's not all there, fine, just get the information out. It's when the survivors said that this is an insult, this is a slap in their face that we aren't getting the truth about who these men were on the - on rape island, that we started sounding the alarm. And this is more documents of nothingness. And I guess the question the American people have even to me, is, is the system so corrupt, is the system so corrupt that Thomas Massie and you defy the odds, pass a bill through a discharge petition, get the Senate, get the president to sign it, and still, these rich and powerful people are being protected. Who has this kind of hold on our government? What are they hiding? Why are they not releasing this?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you want what people involved in those initial investigations down in Florida, re-examined and possibly prosecuted?",
      "REP. KHANNA: I want the information out which was in that prosecution memo that Acosta disregarded, that were in those indictments, that there were 60 counts against Epstein, only two counts were prosecuted. I want to know who were these other people who were on the Epstein's rape island, who were the people who saw young girls being paraded around at parties, 13,14,15 year olds, and didn't say anything. And why- why is it so hard when there's a law requiring these names to come out? What we're seeing is survivors' names come out, but not the men who abuse them. And instead of, instead of holding elites accountable, Pam Bondi is breaking the law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will see when you gentlemen come back to work sometime in January, what your next measures are. It sounds like you've made it clear you're moving action against the Attorney General. Thank you both for your reaction today, Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",

    "summary": "Director of the National Economic Council Kevin Hassett said Sunday that President Trump's idea to give Americans $2,000 checks funded by tariff revenue will \"depend on what happens with Congress.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Director of the National Economic Council Kevin Hassett said Sunday that President Trump's idea to give Americans $2,000 checks funded by tariff revenue will \"depend on what happens with Congress.\"",
      "\"I would expect that in the new year, the president will bring forth a proposal to Congress to make that happen,\" Hassett said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Since July, Mr. Trump has floated a possible rebate for some Americans based on tariff revenue. And last month, the president posted on social media that a \"dividend of at least $2,000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News last month that the checks would likely go to households making less than $100,000. He said at the time it remained \"in discussion.\"",
      "Hassett noted that Congress would have to approve the funds, which would likely be issued through the tax code and require lawmakers to pass new legislation authorizing the Treasury Department to send checks. But Hassett touted \"a lot of positive news about the economy\" since July that he suggested makes the checks more possible.",
      "\"We've had a couple of quarters of almost 4% growth, we've got a big government surplus actually running for a few months in a row, the deficit relative to last year is down by $600 billion,\" Hassett said. \"And so, in the summer, I wasn't so sure that there was space for a check like that. But now I'm pretty sure that there is.\"",
      "Hassett said the funds could come from tariff revenue, while noting that \"in the end, you know, we get taxes, we get tariffs, we get revenue from lots of places, and then Congress decides how to spend those money. That's an appropriation.\"",
      "The comments come as the president has defended the tariffs as one of his administration's signature policies, touting the approach for helping the U.S. raise new revenue and driving investment in U.S. manufacturing.",
      "Hassett said most of the tariffs put in place this year \"have proven their mettle,\" pointing to high growth, reduction in the trade deficit and lower imports from China.",
      "\"So there's a lot of success to crow about in the tariff space,\" Hassett said. \"But there are also things that we're hearing, when we talk to people like trading partners and companies that trade a lot in the U.S., there are also things that maybe could be adjusted.\"",
      "Hassett said \"there's an appetite to exempt things if they're really not meant to be made in the U.S.,\" because of factors like climate. He said U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer is leading that effort.",
      "The top White House economic adviser also expressed confidence that the Supreme Court will side with the administration as the justices consider whether the president has the authority to unilaterally impose tariffs under a federal emergency powers law. The administration has relied on the law to impose duties on nearly every U.S. trading partner.",
      "\"We really expect the Supreme Court is going to find with us,\" Hassett said.",

    "published": "Sun, 21 Dec 2025 11:20:12 -0500",
    "summary": "Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik's decision to drop out came after President Trump signaled he would not make an endorsement in the race at this stage.",
    "story": [
      "Update: President Trump on Saturday endorsed Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman for governor. Read the story here.",
      "Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik dropped out of the New York governor's race Friday, concluding that a potentially fractious GOP primary could hurt Republicans' chances in an uphill statewide contest, as President Trump signaled he would not make an endorsement at this stage.",
      "Stefanik pointed to the risks in a statement to supporters, writing: \"While we would have overwhelmingly won this primary, it is not an effective use of our time or your generous resources to spend the first half of next year in an unnecessary and protracted Republican primary, especially in a challenging state like New York.\"",
      "Stefanik's political future is now unclear, as she said she is not planning to run for re-election in Congress. Stefanik, considered a rising MAGA leader, was initially set to leave Congress after Mr. Trump picked her in November 2024 for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, before her nomination was pulled by the administration in March over concerns about a narrowing Republican majority in the House.",
      "Two sources confirmed to CBS News that Stefanik spoke directly with President Trump on Thursday to discuss her decision to leave the gubernatorial race. Their conversation was first reported by The New York Times.",
      "Mr. Trump later issued a statement following her announcement applauding Stefanik, calling her \"a fantastic person and Congresswoman from New York State\" and describing her as \"a tremendous talent.\" He said she would have \"great success\" in whatever she chooses next and signaled his continued support.",
      "A Republican member of Congress with direct knowledge of the race told CBS News they believed Stefanik ultimately concluded that a contested Republican primary would be difficult and potentially damaging, even if she were likely to win. The other major candidate is Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, another Trump ally.",
      "Under New York GOP rules, candidates must secure at least 25% of the weighted vote at the state party's February convention to qualify for the June primary ballot, or otherwise submit nominating petitions.",
      "While Stefanik was believed to have early support representing well above that threshold \u2014 possibly more than 75% of the weighted vote due to early endorsements from local party officials \u2014 New York Republicans told CBS News that a challenge from Blakeman still risked becoming a prolonged intraparty fight.",
      "The eventual nominee is expected to face off against incumbent Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul. New York hasn't elected a Republican governor since 2002, though Hochul won her 2022 race by a single-digit margin of\u00a0 6.4 percentage points, which spurred renewed interest among Republicans who viewed the result as a sign of potential Democratic vulnerability.",
      "\"My gut tells me this is not the right political time,\" Stefanik told New York Magazine in an interview on Friday. \"This is not the sort of array of things lining up \u2014 which is so difficult in New York, which is incredibly difficult in a picture-perfect year\u2013let alone with a primary and everything else.\"",
      "\"We viewed it as a waste of resources,\" she said, also citing family considerations. \"I have a 4-year old son, and that is a priority for our family.\"",
      "A senior House Republican official also said Stefanik was frustrated that Mr. Trump declined to endorse her early and effectively clear the field for her, a move that Stefanik allies believed could have avoided a divisive primary.",
      "Mr. Trump did call Blakeman after he entered the race, according to sources familiar with the phone call. He told the county executive that he did not like seeing \"good Republicans\" face each other in an electoral battle but he did not directly ask Blakeman to step aside as first reported by The New York Times.",
      "Asked about the race on Dec. 10, the president repeatedly emphasized his reluctance to publicly intervene, stressing his personal relationships with both candidates and concern about collateral damage from a contested primary.",
      "\"First of all, he's a friend. She's a friend,\" Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House. \"These are two great people running. In a way, I hate to see them running against each other. I hope they're not going to be damaging each other.\"",
      "Mr. Trump went on to praise both candidates, saying, \"Elise is fantastic, and Bruce is. They're two fantastic people, and I always hate it when two very good friends of mine are running.\"",
      "Pointing to the state GOP convention, Trump said, \"I think you'll know pretty much at the end of February what's going to happen. And I'll probably have to, you know, do what I want to do.\"",
      "\"We have two very talented people. Either one should win against the Democrats,\" he added.",
      "After Stefanik announced she would end her campaign, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt praised her record, calling her \"an incredible advocate\" for her Upstate New York district and \"a true friend\" to Mr. Trump. Leavitt, who previously worked for Stefanik as a top adviser, added that she is \"a great leader, and an even better person.\"",
      "Stefanik, a member of House Republican leadership and one of Trump's closest allies in Congress, had been viewed by New York Republicans as a formidable contender given her national profile and fundraising strength \u2014 over $12 million raised.",
      "But she faced an uphill battle in deep-blue New York, with a recent Siena College poll showing Hochul with a double-digit lead versus both Republicans at this stage of the race.",

    "summary": "More see Trump's policies responsible for economy today than Biden's; there are also concerns about AI impact on jobs.",
    "story": [
      "As 2025 wraps up, it's another in a string of years after the 2020 pandemic in which most Americans consistently voiced negative views about the economy amid ongoing concerns about costs \u2014 a topic that looks poised to dominate 2026, too.",
      "That's because in the eyes of many Americans today, the U.S. is an expensive place to live. Relatively few describe basics like food and housing today as easy to afford, while housing and health care, in particular, are described by more as \"difficult\" to afford than easy.",
      "Against that backdrop, persuading the wider public that things are improved \u2014 as President Trump aimed to do this past week \u2014 sets up a challenge for him going into 2026.",
      "Expectations aren't that high for the impact of his policies to make them better off in 2026, and many don't think that happened in 2025.",
      "Fewer than one in five say Mr. Trump's policies made them financially better in 2025. Outlook on that for 2026 is better by comparison, but still isn't widespread.",
      "And it still pales compared to 2025's expectations. Just ahead of him being sworn in, more expected Mr. Trump's policies to make them financially better off.",
      "Either way, in the public mind, it is more Mr. Trump's economy than Joe Biden's.",
      "Adding to his challenges: the Americans who give the economy bad grades are even more likely to hold him responsible.",
      "That's maybe partly about what he's done \u2014 people who oppose new tariffs, for example, are especially likely to call it his economy \u2014 but also what they think he hasn't done.\u00a0Those who feel he hasn't put enough focus on lowering prices are even more likely to say this economy is his alone.",
      "The president did halt a months-long steady decline in his handling of the economy and inflation. Each is still low, but now up from the lows of this term recorded in November. His overall approval saw the same dynamic, back up one point.",
      "Most still feel he describes things as better than they really are. That hasn't changed.",
      "On balance, Americans mostly grade the economy as either a \"C\" or \"D\" or worse.",
      "But plenty of people say their views of the president's job performance could change in the new year \u2014 that he could do something to change their minds. That includes a quarter of those who disapprove of Mr. Trump's performance now.",
      "Most of them say that it would have to do with the economy.",
      "All interviewing for this poll was done following the address to the nation on Wednesday night.",
      "Trump\u00a0 drew plenty of support in 2024 from voters in middle-income ranges, but today two-thirds of Americans say he favors the wealthy, not the middle class \u2014 and that number is higher than it was this spring.",
      "Meanwhile, a range of issues swirl ahead of 2026 that could impact people's bottom lines next year. These include the rise of AI, the impact of deportation efforts (including on jobs), and health care policy, which is looming large.",
      "AI",
      "When looking at a range of different aspects of the U.S. economy, Americans tend to be most optimistic about the technology sector. (more than housing or manufacturing, for instance).",
      "At the same time, there's a lot of skepticism about AI's impact, even as it drives the stock market and investments at ever-higher rates in one of the year's biggest economic stories.",
      "A majority think AI will decrease American jobs, not increase them.",
      "On balance, people would have government policy restrict, not promote, AI.",
      "Immigration and deportation",
      "The deportation program continues to divide the country, and it is also connected in the public mind to an impact on the economy and jobs. A sizable number \u2014 especially those who approve of it \u2014 believe jobs that were done by those being deported will now be done by citizens or legal immigrants.",
      "Most who disapprove of the deportation program think those jobs will go unfilled.",
      "Most continue to say border crossings are down this year. It's one reason the president's approval ratings on handling immigration has been higher than his ratings for handling the economy this year.",
      "Health care",
      "Most Americans would like to see the ACA tax credits extended, including more than four in 10 Republicans.",
      "A big majority think the administration's policies are making health insurance costs go up.",
      "Heading into his latest announcement of a recent deal with drug makers, the public was not convinced yet of the president's approach to lowering drug prices \u2014 more think he's making costs go up than down.",
      "On the international front",
      "People don't expect Mr. Trump's policies to have any more impact on peace and stability than they perceived in 2025, and a large majority still says Mr. Trump needs to explain what's going on with Venezuela.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,300 U.S. adults interviewed between December 17-19, 2025.

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to \"Face the Nation.\" We're joined now by the Director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett. Good to have you back.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT, DIRECTOR NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: It's great to be back.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So people are holiday shopping. They're aware of prices. The president said this week prices are coming down tremendously. The latest data, though, from the Consumer Price Index is up 3% year over year, personal consumption index is up 2.8% year over year. What data is he looking at? What's your benchmark?",
      "HASSETT: Right. Well, one of the things that if you saw his presentation in Pennsylvania, as he put up a bunch of charts, which he loves to do, where he went through the individual items that we've already sort of made a bunch of progress on. And so, for example, under Joe Biden, prescription drugs were up 9%. So far this year, they're down six tenths of a percent. Gasoline is way down. It was like the highest ever under Biden--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Eggs, he was talking about eggs, yeah.",
      "HASSETT: Yeah, he was talking about eggs. And so I think the way to think about inflation, of course, is that there are like micro effects, like the time that we had the avian flu affecting drug prices. And then macro effects, which is runaway spending, big deficits and then an accommodative Fed policy. And I think--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But now tariffs adding to some price increases according to the Fed chair.",
      "HASSETT: Well, I- you know, I think that the tariff evidence is mixed. But the point is that we've got deficit going way, way down. So right now, it's looking like the deficit for this year will be $600 billion lower than it was last year. That really helps lower inflation. We've got the trade deficit cut in half from last year. And so all of these things are things that should continue to move us towards the Fed target of 2%.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Companies aren't necessarily going to bring items down, though, in terms of pricing, right? I mean, the- the president told the Wall Street Journal he didn't know when all of this money, quote, \"is going to kick in.\" I think he was talking to business investment and tariffs, and help voters, \"all I can do is do my job.\" When do you anticipate voters will feel this positive impact?",
      "HASSETT: Right. Well, it's definitely the case that, and you guys have been covered a lot, that consumer sentiment right now is lower than anyone would like. But, you know, we find that that very often happens during a government shutdown when everybody's really upset--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the last administration called that the \"vibecession,\" right?",
      "HASSETT: No, but--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --the data is good, but people feel bad.",
      "HASSETT: --Yeah, but what's going to happen is--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Same thing, you're saying.",
      "HASSETT: No what's- I'm not saying that. What- what I'm saying is that people are going to see the high growth. Growth is 4%. Income growth is up about $1,200 this year. People look at their wallets and see they're doing better, which is why we had the biggest Black Friday ever and so on and so--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's more higher income se--",
      "HASSETT: --The sentiment will catch up with the reality. Under Joe Biden, the fact is that real purchasing power dropped by about $3,000. So far this year, it's up by about $1,200 per family. And the money that we're talking about is like real money. So for groceries, it went from $400 a month to $525 a month under Biden. So that's like an extra more than $1,000 a year. You have to spend on groceries. It's down this year for us, for the grocery package, but it's still got a lot of room to grow- to go.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A lot more to go--",
      "HASSETT: Yeah.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the president reduced some tariffs on some of those grocery items--",
      "HASSETT: --On the food stuff--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --with an eye towards that.",
      "HASSETT: Yeah, if we don't make it here, then pretty much we don't tariff it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you, you mentioned gas. Oil prices globally are relatively low. We saw this Coast Guard interdiction with military forces boarding and seizing this vessel off the coast of Venezuela. Do you feel you have the leeway there, pricing-wise, to conduct more seizures or even a blockade of oil from Venezuela, without it hurting?",
      "HASSETT: Well, I'm not a foreign policy guy, so what we do with Venezuela and whether we blockade is up to the president and Marco Rubio. But I could say that--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But you've got the leeway, right--",
      "HASSETT: --that- that what's been going on is there's been kind of a black market for oil amongst sort of this sanctioned countries. And what we're doing is we're shutting that black market down. Whether that affects prices outside of the sanctioned countries is kind of an open question. Probably not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think it will?",
      "HASSETT: No, because they're already kind of on the ropes, these countries. They're only getting oil when they get like sort of black fleets to sneak in and give them the oil. And that's what we're trying to slow down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, I want to ask you about the Fed decision. The Federal Open Market Committee said job gains have slowed this year. We also saw the survey from the Business Roundtable. I'm sure you saw it. They asked CEOs what they expect to happen, and they anticipate employment will decrease in 2026 rather than increase. Are you concerned about a hiring slowdown?",
      "HASSETT: The same Fed said that they were more bullish on growth for next year, right? And so I think that we're at a certain--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But on the jobs picture.",
      "HASSETT: But on the jobs picture, you know, we're going to get the data next week. And so maybe next Sunday I'll come back and we'll talk about it, because we've got two months of data coming out on Tuesday. And we'll get a clearer picture because right now we just have some very difficult to pin down surveys like the gold standard for this will be really the household survey, which we don't even get for October.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But these are CEOs. They're the people who would be doing the hiring, right? And they're saying, we're not doing it.",
      "HASSETT: But, but they don't have the broad perspective that we'll get when we get the big data released next week.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you trust that big data?",
      "HASSETT: I trust the household survey, especially. And sadly, we won't have one for October. But we're going to get one for November. And that's going to be really important for thinking about where the job market is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Employment is one of the things that the Fed watches closely. And we heard again from the president that you were on this short list to be potentially the next Fed chair, although he was conducting interviews this week. He said you and Hoover's Kevin Warsh are at the top of the list. On Friday, the president was asked how big of a role he wants to personally play in future Fed interest rate decisions. Take a listen.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE BEGINS]",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think I certainly should have a role in talking to whoever the head of the Fed is, or the Fed. I don't think- you know the old days that used to happen. Nowadays, it's sort of, they think it shouldn't happen. But I've done great. I've made a lot of money, I'm very successful. I think my voice should be heard.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 As Fed chair, how frequently would you consult with the president when he says he wants his voice heard?",
      "HASSETT: Well, I'm right now the top economic advisor for the president, and I talk about almost everything with him almost every day. I've certainly talked about monetary policy. I think he has very strong and well-founded views about what we ought to do. But in the end, the job of the Fed is to be independent and to work with the group of people that are on the Board of Governors, at the FOMC, to drive a group consensus on where interest rates should be and to do so, you know, basically with the guidance of the Fed chair. But in the end, it's a committee that votes. And I'd be happy to talk to the president every day, you know, until both of us are dead because it's so much fun to talk--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even if you were Fed Chair.",
      "HASSETT:\u00a0 Even if I were Fed Chair or if I wasn't Fed Chair. You know what, I would hope that Kevin Warsh would be talking to the president as well if he were Fed Chair.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And voice should be heard is going to be--",
      "HASSETT: You know, every Fed Chair talks to lots and lots of market experts--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Equal to the other members- of the voting members or?",
      "HASSETT: Excuse me?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Would the president's voice have equal weighting to the voting members?",
      "HASSETT: No, no, he would have no weight. It's just his opinion matters if it's good, you know, if it's based on data. And then if you go to the committee and you say, well, the president made this argument and that's a really sound argument, I think, what do you think? If they reject it, then they'll vote in a different way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. Well, we'll be watching to see what happens. Kevin Hassett.",
      "HASSETT: Great to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thanks as always. We'll be right back.",

    "published": "Fri, 19 Dec 2025 16:18:02 -0500",
    "summary": "Nine drug manufacturers will offer their drugs to Medicaid recipients at most-favored-nation discounts in exchange for tariff exemptions.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Friday announced new agreements with nine pharmaceutical manufacturers aimed at reducing certain prescription drug prices.",
      "\"Starting next year, American drug prices will come down fast and furious and will soon be the lowest in the developed world,\" Mr.\u00a0 Trump said Friday at the White House.",
      "Under the deal, the nine manufacturers will offer their drugs to Medicaid recipients at most-favored-nation discounts, a policy that requires the prices to match those paid by patients in other developed nations. The nine companies will also offer medicines \"at a deep discount off the list price\" to Americans through TrumpRx, according to the White House. The Trump administration plans to offer tariff exemptions to the drugmakers for three years in exchange for the MFN pricing commitments.",
      "According to a White House fact sheet, the drugs that will be covered include treatments for chronic conditions, including type two diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hepatitis B and C, human immunodeficiency virus and certain cancers.",
      "Amgen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol Myers Squibb, Genentech, Gilead Science, GSK, Merck, Novartis, and Sanofi will sell drugs on TrumpRx, the administration's discount drug pricing program. TrumpRx \u2014 which the administration has said will launch early next year \u2014 will not sell drugs directly, but instead will direct consumers to lower prices elsewhere.",
      "Senior administration officials said that roughly 30-40% of Medicaid drug prices are currently higher than what patients in other wealthy nations pay, mostly Europeans, and that the prices of those drugs will drop.",
      "The president has previously announced agreements with AstraZeneca, EMD Serono, Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Pfizer. The White House said it has made MFN deals with 14 of the 17 biggest drug manufacturers in the world. The three drugmakers that were not part of the announcement are AbbVie, Johnson & Johnson and Regeneron, but the president said that deals involving the remaining three could be announced at another time.",
      "\"[The policy] affects every American so that they have the dignity to access the same medical innovations that our tax dollars helped develop,\" a White House official said. \"This is about healthcare fairness.\"",
      "But questions remain about how the president's deals with drugmakers will work \u2014 and who will feel the difference at the pharmacy counter. Most-favored-nation pricing could have a muted impact on Medicaid patients, experts say, because the program already has a statutory \"best price\" protection that guarantees the lowest price offered to any U.S. commercial payer. Also, while it could save states money, Medicaid users typically don't pay out-of-pocket for their medication.",
      "Medicaid recipients are \"starting out at prices well below the averages seen in the U.S. market,\" Darius Lakdawalla, chief scientific officer at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center, pointed out to CBS News after the president announced the Pfizer deal.",
      "The White House said the new agreement represents more than $150 billion in new investment commitments in manufacturing and research and development in the U.S.",
      "In addition to the drugmakers' commitment to MFN and TrumpRx, several drugmakers' will be donating active pharmaceutical ingredients to the Strategic Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Reserve, an initiative designed to stockpile critical raw materials and drug components in order to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign drug manufacturing during disruptions like pandemics.",
      "\"This is the president's answer to pharmaceutical vulnerability, such that when the disaster strikes, whether it's natural catastrophe, pandemic or a national security emergency, America will be ready,\" a senior administration official said.",
      "Officials said the administration expects to see \"major reductions in Medicaid prices\" as it aims to match the prices of several Medicaid drugs with MFN levels.",
      "\"Medicaid has prices that are much higher than what other European nations pay,\" a senior administration official said. \"Americans should not pay more than other developed nations.\"",
      "But injectable drugs and infusion medications will not be available on TrumpRx because the White House has concluded these drugs must be administered by health care providers and should not be on a direct-to-consumer platform.",

      "Many Americans are feeling the pinch this holiday season.",

      "Holiday spending also spotlights the long-standing differences in Americans' financial situations. Those who report their financial situation as good, who tend to have higher incomes, say affording the holidays is easier. But even they say things are costing more.",

      "Relatively few Americans say they will be buying more gifts, entertainment or airline tickets or food and drinks this holiday season, compared to recent years. Those who say it will be difficult to afford items this year are especially likely to say they will be scaling back on these things.",

      "Looking back on 2025",
      "Views of the economy have been low for years, and 2025 continued that trend. But beneath those sentiments, the year also showed a consistent split between those who feel their finances are good and bad \u2014 the former generally having higher incomes and saying the stock market matters to their finances, the latter having lower incomes and being more impacted by prices and inflation.",
      "On personal finances, about half of the country continues to say their financial situation is good, while about half say it is bad, which has been the case throughout the year.",
      "Looking back, overall, for those whose financial situation changed over the year, more said it got worse rather than better.\u00a0 But those who did feel their situation improved were also more likely to be those with higher incomes.",
      "The year ends with most Americans voicing larger concerns about inflation that have persisted for years. Throughout 2025, about three-quarters said their incomes were not keeping pace with inflation. Views of the overall economy remain low.",
      "The public's evaluations of the U.S. job market specifically remain net negative. This comes as the latest government data shows somewhat of a mixed bag: more jobs were added in November than economists expected, but the unemployment rate ticked up to its highest level since September 2021.",
      "Among the bright spots, on balance, more Americans rate the condition of the stock market as good than rate it as bad, and that's particularly so among those for whom the market's performance matters a lot to their finances.",
      "More Americans now say the price of gas in their area is coming down than say it's going up \u2014 a reversal from what we saw this fall and over the year.",

      "Using the Freedom of Information Act, CBS News obtained the Navy's investigation into members of SEAL Team Four, along with years of the unit's internal surveys, which give naval officers insight into the culture, morale and effectiveness. The investigation and other records show racial harassment towards one of the team's own members inside a force that prides itself on unit cohesion and honor\u2014prompting action from the top commander.",
      "One racist meme sent to the SEAL in 2022 was described in the investigation as \"Slave in Chains.\" Another meme sent in 2022 was titled \"Monkey Face\" and depicted the SEAL in uniform with his face distorted to look like a monkey. A meme sent in 2023 compared him to the movie character Radio, a mentally disabled man played by Cuba Gooding Jr.",
      "The full results of the Navy's investigation and the internal surveys have not been reported on until now. The After-Action Report, a national security blog on Substack, first reported on the memes, earlier this year.",
      "The punishments ranged from reduction in rank and forfeiture of pay to administrative measures, like formal letters of instruction and counseling, according to the Navy spokesperson.",
      "CBS News has learned that Rear Adm. Milton Sands, then the head of Naval Special Warfare Command, acted swiftly once the allegations surfaced in March. Sands has since been removed from his position by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The reason for his removal is unknown.",
      "Attorney William Brown of the Parlatore Law Group and a former Navy SEAL himself told CBS News in a phone interview that what happened at SEAL Team Four violates \"everything the Teams stand for,\" and he praised Rear Adm. Sands and other naval special warfare leaders for taking \"unprecedented action\" in this case.",
      "\"This was not a SEAL Team Four issue; it was a platoon-level leadership failure, but Sands took action and the system worked,\" said Brown, who represented the SEAL pro bono.",
      "Brown said Sands and other senior leaders inside the command moved to support the Black SEAL and to send a message to the wider naval special operations community that racist conduct would carry severe consequences. Brown lauded Sands for his leadership in the case, despite the fact that he has had public disagreements with the two-star admiral on other issues.",
      "Sands has not responded to a request for comment.",
      "The Navy launched an investigation into the memes and messages, originally shared in a private Signal group chat between 2021 and 2024, when they were raised in complaints filed by the Black SEAL in March.",
      "The SEAL wrote in the harassment complaint that before joining his platoon, he had not experienced any racial discrimination and had \"great mentors\" while undergoing the notoriously grueling training to become a qualified SEAL, which takes Naval candidates roughly two years to complete.",
      "But after he joined, \"the racism I experienced\u2026was persistent, targeted and deeply dehumanizing,\" wrote the SEAL. \"It wasn't just an attack on me personally \u2014 it reflected a breakdown in the very discipline and integrity the Teams are supposed to uphold.\"",
      "In the complaint, the Black Navy SEAL said his name was scratched off two plaques where it once appeared alongside others serving on SEAL Team Four. On one of the plaques, the names are etched into a piece of wood under a hatchet adorned with Navy SEAL Tridents, the physical pin that signifies a SEAL.",
      "The SEAL described the removal of his name as \"A final, disgraceful act to make it clear that I was not welcome,\" and that it was \"a direct and unmistakable act of hatred.\"",
      "Overall, the SEAL wrote of others' behavior, \"these were men who were supposed to be my brothers, but instead, they either participated in or enabled a culture of bigotry and silence.\"",
      "SEAL Team Four is based out of Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek in Virginia and falls under Naval Special Warfare Group Two, which oversees Team Four and three other SEAL Teams.",
      "Each SEAL Team can have roughly 250 service members, including Navy SEALs and combat support personnel, according to the command climate surveys obtained by CBS News and former Navy SEALs.",
      "The Black Navy SEAL, who declined to be interviewed, was in Delta platoon, a unit of roughly 16 to 20 SEALs. Prior to becoming a SEAL, he had earned a degree in global studies and was a trained pilot, according to the documents.",
      "He filed the harassment complaints after his Trident, the physical pin that signifies a SEAL, was revoked after review boards found his performance was lacking. But records obtained by CBS News show he was a qualified sniper and a certified joint terminal attack controller or JTAC for short. JTACs fill a high-stress role \u2013 it requires extreme precision, since the controllers coordinate aircraft delivering bombs and missiles, sometimes near their position on the ground. A mistake can be deadly.",
      "Brown, in refuting the SEAL's substandard performance review, pointed out that SEAL leaders typically send their smartest service members to sniper and JTAC school.",
      "After an investigation, the SEAL's Trident was restored. Brown believes he's the first Navy SEAL in history whose Trident was restored after it was revoked. The board that carried out the SEAL's review will undergo reforms, Brown told CBS News.",
      "Moreover, Brown said Rear Adm. Sands also called the SEAL to thank him for his service and extended his Navy tenure to enable him to get military medical treatment and moved him to a command that is closer to his family. The SEAL has since left the Navy.",
      "A Naval Special Warfare spokesperson said the Navy had \"completed accountability\" regarding the SEAL's case.",
      "\"Individuals accepted responsibility for their actions, reinforcing NSW's commitment to accountability, transparency, and upholding the standard of the quiet professional,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The SEAL's superiors did not enable the chat content, according to the spokesperson, but they were counseled in front of their peers because the incident had occurred under their command. Brown, the SEAL's attorney, said those counseled included the commanding officer, executive officer and command master chief of SEAL Team Four.",
      "Brown told CBS News that he had previously served with the commanding officer of SEAL Team Four.",
      "\"He is not a racist man but he made a misjudgment in this case,\" Brown told CBS News. \"They will never command forces in NSW again.\"",
      "The leadership also held all-hands calls at various levels to address the misconduct within the group chat directly with the force, according to the spokesperson.",
      "Some of the misconduct in the chat stemmed from \"meme drop(s)\" the members had periodically on Fridays \"to make fun of things that happened each week,\" according to one individual whom investigators found had contributed to a hostile environment because he did not stop the messages. Four of the six memes investigated were sent on a Friday, according to the investigation.",
      "The investigated messages included one that read, \"I dropped a hard R in front of a black student 3 weeks ago.\" The author had a \"pattern of behavior\" using the word \"n*****,\" investigators found.",
      "In the course of their review, military investigators also discovered some team members had referred to a fellow service member as \"dragon lady\" and mocked her Asian accent.",
      "When asked by CBS News if there is any mandated racial sensitivity training, the spokesperson said there was not, adding that the command is committed to accountability. The investigations helped \"identify shortcomings and implement corrective measures.\"",
      "CBS News obtained Defense Organizational Climate Surveys for SEAL Team Four through the Freedom of Information Act for the years 2018, 2022, 2023 and 2024. These surveys provide commanders with both statistical details and comments from their service members on a wide array of issues within their units.",
      "Troops are not required to fill them out, and the responses are anonymous. But all Defense Department units are required to take them annually or whenever a new officer takes over a command of more than 50 people.",
      "SEAL teams generally have limited numbers of troops representing racial and ethnic minorities. Nonetheless, the records obtained by CBS News show that service members have persistently reported racially harassing behavior. In 2024 for instance, 5 out of the 105 members of SEAL Team Four who took the survey reported it.",
      "The figures were higher in 2022 when 18 out of the 105 members of SEAL Team Four reported experiencing racially harassing behaviors. The Team took two surveys in 2023 showing fluctuating but similar results.",
      "Between 2022 and 2024, SEAL Team Four commanders writing to their direct superior underscored that they believe \"diversity is key to organizational growth,\" and that they \"highly encourage inclusion of all personnel, regardless of ethnicity, background, rate, or otherwise.\"",
      "In a Nov. 2023 letter, Cmdr. Bryan Jennings, the commander of Navy SEAL TEAM Four at the time, wrote: \"Racial and sexual harassing behaviors were 6%-7% negative, which is an overall low number, but any percentage in these categories is a weakness that should be addressed.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 17 Dec 2025 11:00:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Justice Department is suing more than a dozen landlords on allegations of sexual harassment, a problem one top department official called \"traumatic for the victims\" and \"inappropriate and illegal.\"",
    "story": [
      "In a crowded neighborhood of duplexes, small apartments and one-story bungalows near a liquor store and pizza shop, William Asper serves as a landlord for nearly two dozen properties.",
      "The Detroit suburb of Westland, Michigan, 10 minutes north of the Detroit Metropolitan Airport, is where Asper helps manage some weathered rental properties, many of which were built in the early 1970s and are more affordable to low-income families in this working-class region, according to federal records published by the Justice Department.",
      "Amid surging housing costs, rent in the neighborhood is more affordable, including for families who use federal subsidies and have no other options for housing.",
      "The Justice Department has alleged Asper tried to take advantage of the needs of his tenants, leveraging his position to seek sexual favors. The agency said Asper threatened to withhold repairs or evict tenants who did not comply.",
      "In a court filing in Michigan earlier this month, the Justice Department alleged Asper told one tenant in 2019 \"that there were 'different ways' she could pay rent.\" The government's attorneys also said he \"touched the tenant without her consent, regularly pulling her hair, grabbing her buttocks and kissing her head.\" And they alleged he \"regularly pulled his penis out of his pants in front of the tenant while at her home, often times while her young son was in the room.\"",
      "In their court documents, Justice Department lawyers also alleged that in 2018, Asper told a \"female tenant that he was lonely, wanted someone to spend time with him, and asked if she would go to a hotel with him. Asper allegedly \"told the female tenant that if she did not engage in sexual relations with him, he would give her a 24-hour eviction notice.\"",
      "The allegations appeared in a civil lawsuit filed by the Justice Department against Asper, arguing he violated the federal Fair Housing Act. His civil case is pending in the Eastern District of Michigan federal court, and his formal response to the allegations has not yet been posted.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Asper said the accusations are false.",
      "\"I offer low-income housing and people want to blame the landlord or make excuses why they couldn't pay the rent,\" Asper said. \"These women wanted to do more/be my 'girlfriend', side chick and that was not going to happen.\"",
      "Asper isn't the only landlord facing such claims. It is one of at least 52 federal civil lawsuits alleging sexual harassment and misconduct against landlords since 2017.",
      "\"It's traumatic for the victims,\" said Harmeet Dhillon, the assistant U.S. attorney general for civil rights. \"People may not believe them. And they may have been the victim multiple times.\"",
      "The Justice Department's Sexual Harassment in Housing Initiative, which seeks to combat these types of cases, was launched in the first year of the first Trump administration in 2017. Dhillon's team continues to pursue the cases. Several former Justice Department attorneys, including appointees of both the Biden and Trump Administrations, have lauded the program and its work since 2017.",
      "There are 14 federal sexual harassment civil cases pending across the United States, including Asper's case in Michigan.",
      "In an interview with CBS News, Dhillon said the filings of these suits can serve as a deterrent to future harassment and abuse. She said the legal challenges \"made all the women in that property feel like they've been seen and heard.\"",
      "Dhillon said the Fair Housing Act, which passed in 1968 amid the sweeping changes of the Civil Rights era, prohibits any kind of quid pro quo involving sex, sexual acts or sexual harassment, either for renting, continuing to rent or obtaining repairs.",
      "\"Every American deserves to feel safe and know this sexual harassment is inappropriate and illegal,\" Dhillon said.",
      "A CBS News review of some of the dozens of recently filed Justice Department cases shows parallels to the accusations against Asper.",
      "In a separate legal challenge filed against a central New York landlord in 2018, the Justice Department alleged the harassment spanned three decades. The Oswego man is accused of \"Demanding that female tenants engage in, or pressuring them to engage in, sexual intercourse, oral sex, or other sexual acts with him in order to obtain or keep rental housing.\"",
      "In a 2017 Justice Department complaint filed in federal court in Kansas, a Wichita-area landlord is accused of entering a female tenant's apartment \"unannounced\" and \"touching her body while she slept in her bed.\" The landlord is also accused of \"Conditioning tangible housing benefits, including forgiving or reducing rent, on engaging in sexual conduct.\"",
      "And in a legal challenge initially filed in Minnesota in 2020, the feds alleged a landlord offered to overlook or excuse unpaid rent and utilities in exchange for sex acts. The landlord was also accused of \"Expressing a preference for renting to single female tenants.\"",
      "The legal challenges filed by the Justice Department can help secure civil penalties against landlords and damages for victims. A CBS News review of Justice Department records showed the agency has recovered approximately $1.5 million since January.",
      "And in the New York, Kansas and Minnesota cases, the Justice Department struck written agreements with the landlords that, among other things, required them to hire independent property managers so they would no longer need to come into contact with tenants themselves.",
      "A spokesperson for the National Fair Housing Alliance, a civil rights group that advocates for tenants and combats discrimination, said instances of sexual harassment by landlords are likely more pervasive than current statistics indicate.",
      "\"Sexual harassment in housing is one of the most underreported instances of housing discrimination, given that the victims often fear facing retaliation or eviction if they file a complaint,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, which handles Fair Housing Act sex harassment probes, has experienced a purge of veteran employees this year, amid a Trump-ordered downsizing of the federal government \u2014 led by the Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 and the Trump Administration's dramatic shifts in some of the office's priorities.",
      "Justice Connection, a newly formed organization that supports ousted or resigning Justice Department prosecutors, estimated nearly 75% of career attorneys in the division have departed this year.",
      "Dhillon said the unit that handles the housing cases has been less impacted by the changes and cuts. She told CBS News, \"I don't think we're losing people in that section, and people are pretty happy with the type of work we're doing.\" Dhillon said the Civil Rights section has hired approximately 50 people this year, amid the larger turnover in the agency.",
      "Some tenants have filed their own individual federal civil lawsuits alleging sex harassment in violation of the Fair Housing Act.",
      "In one case, an Alabama woman filed a complaint in federal court alleging a series of personal harms. Her suit alleged \"emotional distress, including humiliation and mental anguish\" from a landlord who \"offered to reduce her rent in exchange for sex.\" The lawsuit alleged: \"When [she] refused his sexual advances, he raised her rent.\"",
      "Housing advocates said low-income renters are particularly vulnerable to harassment, under fear that they could lose their housing if they reject a landlord's unlawful advances.",
      "The Justice Department's posted guidance on its protections of the Fair Housing Act says that \"women, particularly those who are poor, and with limited housing options, often have little recourse but to tolerate the humiliation and degradation of sexual harassment or risk having their families and themselves removed from their homes. The Department's enforcement program is aimed at landlords who create an untenable living environment by demanding sexual favors from tenants or by creating a sexually hostile environment for them.\"",
      "The National Fair Housing Alliance spokesperson told CBS News: \"Each investigation\u2014and especially every resolution\u2014sends a clear message that this egregious conduct, which targets the most vulnerable, will not be tolerated. Home should be a safe place, and these actions ensure that promise is upheld.\"",
      "Justice Connection, an organization of former Justice Department employees, told CBS News it estimates the agency's housing unit has lost nearly half of its staff this year.",

    "published": "Tue, 16 Dec 2025 13:25:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Most of the footprints are elongated and made by bipeds. The best-preserved ones bear traces of at least four toes.",
    "story": [
      "Hundreds of yards of dinosaur tracks with toes and claws have been found in the Italian Alps in a region that will host the 2026 Winter Olympics, authorities said Tuesday.",
      "\"This set of dinosaur footprints is one of the largest collections in all of Europe, in the whole world,\" Attilio Fontana, head of the Lombardy region in northern Italy, said during a news conference.",
      "The tracks, which are over 200 million years old, were discovered in the Stelvio National Park, in an area between the towns of Bormio and Livigno, which host part of the Games.",
      "Nature photographer Elio Della Ferrera first spotted the imprints in September in an almost vertical rocky slope.",
      "Some measured up to 16 inches in diameter.",
      "The collection \"extends for hundreds of meters and also represents a series of animal behaviors, because in addition to seeing animals walking together, there are also places where these animals meet,\" Fontana said.",
      "Della Ferrera called in paleontologist Cristiano Dal Sasso from Milan's Natural History Museum, who assembled a team of Italian experts to study the site.",
      "The museum released multiple images of the footprints uncovered in the so-called valley of dinosaurs\u00a0on social media.",
      "\"It's an immense scientific heritage,\" Dal Sasso said in the region's press release.",
      "\"The parallel walks are clear evidence of herds moving in synchrony, and there are also traces of more complex behaviors, such as groups of animals gathered in a circle, perhaps for defense.\"",
      "\"Impressions of the toes and even the claws\"",
      "The tracks, currently covered by snow and off the beaten track, are preserved in Upper Triassic dolomitic rocks, dating back approximately 210 million years.",
      "Most of the footprints are elongated and made by bipeds. The best-preserved ones bear traces of at least four toes.",
      "That suggests they belong to prosauropods, herbivorous dinosaurs with long necks and small heads, which are considered the ancestors of the large sauropods of the Jurassic period like the Brontosaurus, the experts said.",
      "Prosauropods had sharp claws, and adults could reach up to 33 feet in length.",
      "There may also be tracks of predatory dinosaurs and archosaurs, the ancestors of crocodiles, the press release said.",
      "The prints are on an almost-vertical slope due to the formation of the Alpine chain.",
      "But when the dinosaurs walked through the area, it was formed of tidal flats that stretched for hundreds of miles, and the environment was tropical.",
      "\"The tracks were made when the sediments were still soft and saturated with water, on the broad tidal flats surrounding the Tethys Ocean,\" ichnologist Fabio Massimo Petti said, referring to a prehistoric ocean.",
      "\"The plasticity of those very fine calcareous muds, now transformed into rock, has in areas preserved truly remarkable anatomical details, such as impressions of the toes and even the claws,\" he said.",
      "The footprints were then covered by sediments which protected them, but with the uplift of the Alps and the erosion of the mountainside, they have been brought back into view.",
      "\"As the layers containing the tracks are diverse and overlapping, we have a unique opportunity to study the evolution of animals and their environment over time,\" geologist Fabrizio Berra said. \"Like reading the pages of a stone book.\"",
      "Other recent dinosaur track discoveries",

    "published": "Sun, 21 Dec 2025 18:10:22 -0500",
    "summary": "NASA is gearing up to send four Artemis astronauts on looping test flight around the moon in 2026.",
    "story": [
      "Four astronauts in training to fly around the moon early next year strapped into their Orion spacecraft this weekend for a dress rehearsal countdown in a major milestone toward launch.",
      "Based on repeated stops and starts seen on NASA's countdown clock, the complex test originally planned for late November, ran into problems at various points on Saturday. NASA provided no details, but Artemis 2 commander Reid Wiseman said that overall, the test went well.",
      "\"Extremely successful day in our spacecraft #Integrity,\" Wiseman said in a post on X. \"Did everything go perfectly? Absolutely not. But this vehicle and our team showed us they're up to the challenge. Launch is getting very close.\"",
      "Launch is tentatively targeted for early February, but the schedule is extremely tight and the flight may slip to early March. No decisions are expected until after the first of next year.",
      "In any case, Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch and Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen, wearing bright orange pressure suits, strapped into their Orion capsule using the same procedures they'll follow on launch day.",
      "Such \"countdown demonstration tests\" have traditionally taken place shortly before launch with the rocket and crew ship already on the launch pad. But for Saturday's test, the astronauts boarded their spacecraft atop NASA's huge Space Launch System (SLS) rocket inside the cavernous Vehicle Assembly Building at the Kennedy Space Center.",
      "Over the course of the exercise, the astronauts and the launch control team worked through the same countdown procedures they will follow on launch day, ending less than a minute before the clocks would normally hit zero.",
      "Five launch opportunities are available in February when the moon and Earth are in the proper relative positions. The first such opportunity comes on Feb. 6. To make that date, the SLS rocket and Orion would have to be rolled from the assembly building to pad 39B in mid January, setting the stage for a critical fueling test that must go well before NASA can proceed to launch.",
      "Given the amount of work remaining to complete preparations, sources say NASA may opt to delay the flight to early March.",
      "Whenever it takes off, the flight plan calls for the Orion and its crew to spend 25 hours in an elliptical orbit around Earth to test spacecraft life support, propulsion and navigation systems.",
      "The crew plans to fly in close proximity to the SLS rocket's upper stage to test the Orion's maneuvering systems and rendezvous procedures that will be needed for eventual moon landing missions.",
      "An uncrewed Orion carried out a similar loop around the moon during the Artemis 1 mission in November 2022. But the Lockheed Martin-built spacecraft was not equipped with a full life support system and it did not carry out thruster firings like those needed for a rendezvous.",
      "Once the testing is complete, the Artemis 2 Orion will leave Earth orbit on a \"free return\" trajectory that will carry the crew around the moon and back to a Pacific Ocean splashdown. The ship will not go into orbit around the moon.",
      "But Artemis 2 will still be the first piloted trip back to the moon since the Apollo 17 mission in 1972, carrying Wiseman and his crewmates farther from Earth than any other humans have ever traveled.",
      "The flight will set the stage for Artemis 3, carrying yet-to-be-named astronauts to the surface of the moon near the lunar south pole, NASA hopes, in 2028.",
      "The Artemis 3 flight originally was planned for 2024, a target set during the first Trump administration. But the mission has been repeatedly delayed by processing problems, slowdowns during the COVID pandemic, Super Heavy-Starship testing and work to develop the lunar lander, known by NASA as the Human Landing System, or HLS.",
      "The current 2028 target was set in the past few weeks when it became apparent the space agency would not be ready in time for the most recent previous target of 2027.",
      "China also plans to land its own \"taikonauts\" on the moon by 2030, creating a new space race of sorts, one that NASA vows to win.",

    "published": "Sat, 20 Dec 2025 21:21:27 -0500",
    "summary": "German engineer Michaela Benthaus is the first person with a significant physical handicap to reach space.",
    "story": [
      "In a space-age milestone, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin launched a wheelchair-using engineer and handicap advocate to the edge of space Saturday, a 10-minute trip that allowed her to enjoy a few minutes of weightlessness more than 65 miles above Earth.",
      "Michaela Benthaus, a German aerospace engineer who suffered a spinal cord injury in a 2018 mountain biking accident, joined a retired SpaceX manager and four entrepreneurs for the up-and-down flight to a point just above the so-called \"boundary\" of space.",
      "\"It was the coolest experience!\" she said after landing, joking about turning upside down in weightlessness. \"I didn't only like the view and the microgravity, but I also liked the going up. That was so cool, every stage of going up.\"",
      "Benthaus was assisted during training and inside the Blue Origin capsule by Hans Koenigsmann, a former SpaceX manager and engineer who was instrumental in the development of that company's workhorse Falcon family of rockets.",
      "A fellow German by birth and a naturalized U.S. citizen, Koenigsmann helped arrange Benthaus' flight after meeting her last year.",
      "\"I met Hans the first time online,\" Benthaus said in a Blue Origin interview. \"I just asked him, like, you know, you worked for so long for SpaceX, do you think that people like me can be astronauts?",
      "\"Then he reached out to Blue Origin and told me oh, Blue actually is very excited about it. Okay, I have my doubts on it, but let's see. Thankfully it turned out we can do it. So Hans and me (ended) up flying as a team,\" Benthaus continued.",
      "Koenigsmann said Benthaus \"basically inspired me to do this. It's her drive that kind of convinced me I should do that, too, and to just experience something that I've seen from the outside for a long time.\"",
      "Benthaus was able to make her own way from her wheelchair into the New Shepard capsule before launch, scooting along a bench extending from the hatch that was provided by Blue Origin. Koenigsmann was strapped in nearby to offer assistance during the flight if needed.",
      "Running two days late because of last-minute technical issues, the countdown ticked smoothly to zero Saturday and the New Shepard blasted off from Blue Origin's West Texas launch pad at 9:15 a.m. EST.",
      "Accelerating straight up into a mostly clear sky, the capsule's single-stage booster reached a velocity of nearly three times the speed of sound before its hydrogen-fueled BE-3 engine shut down about two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff.",
      "At that point, the New Shepard capsule was released to continue coasting upward on its own, and the crew, now weightless, was free to briefly unstrap and float about the cabin.",
      "Benthaus' legs were strapped together to keep them in place, but she, too, was free to enjoy the thrill of weightlessness as the New Shepard coasted up to a peak altitude of slightly more than 65 miles, well above the 62-mile-high point where aerodynamic forces no longer have any effect.",
      "At that altitude, the \"sky\" is deep black and Earth's horizon is sharply curved. Passengers are able to take in the view through the largest windows ever flown in space.",
      "\"Oh, my God,\" one passenger could be heard exclaiming over the capsule's radio.",
      "\"Incredible,\" another said.",
      "Falling back into the lower atmosphere, the crew was warned to get back in their seats to strap in before the onset of atmospheric deceleration. Maximum deceleration subjects New Shepard crews to about five times the normal pull of gravity.",
      "The booster, meanwhile, followed a similar trajectory, falling tail first back toward the launch site. Nearing the ground, the BE-3 engine re-ignited, landing legs deployed and the rocket settled to an on-target touchdown on a concrete pad near the launch gantry.",
      "The New Shepard came down under three large parachutes, landing in a cloud of dust near the booster and its launch pad. Blue Origin support personnel quickly reached the spacecraft to help the crew exit.",
      "Joining Benthaus and Koenigsmann aboard the New Shepard were physicist-investor Joey Hyde, entrepreneur Neal Milch, adventurer Jason Stansell and Adonis Pouroulis, a South African entrepreneur and mining engineer.",
      "All six waved, smiling broadly as they climbed out of the capsule one at a time. Benthaus was last out, carried from the spacecraft by Koenigsmann and a member of Blue Origin's recovery team to a nearby wheelchair.",
      "\"You should never give up on your dreams, right?,\" she said after landing. \"I just feel very lucky, and I'm very grateful to Blue and Hans and everyone who said yes to this journey.\"",
      "Blue Origin does not publicly disclose the cost of a New Shepard seat, but the price is thought to be upwards of $500,000 each. How Benthaus' seat was financed was not revealed.",
      "Saturday's launch marked Blue Origin's 16th New Shepard flight with passengers aboard since Bezos, his brother and two others blasted off on the first such flight in July 2021. Including Saturday's flight, Blue Origin has now launched 92 men and women to space, including six who have flown twice.",
      "While Benthaus was the first person with a significant physical handicap to fly in space, European Space Agency astronaut John McFall, who has a prosthetic leg, has been cleared for selection to a future flight to the International Space Station.",
      "Benthaus said before launch the reaction to her flight aboard the New Shepard was mostly positive, saying she hopes more handicapped people might make their way to space.",
      "The big question for NASA and other space agencies and private companies is not so much whether handicapped astronauts can carry out their duties in the weightless environment of space. It's more about how they can handle an emergency that might require a speedy exit from their spacecraft, either on the ground or in space.",
      "In an interview with CNN, Benthaus said \"we're thinking more and more about long-duration space missions; some of us want to go to the Mars in the future.\"",
      "\"That's a very long journey. And, yes, people can get a disability on the way. People can have a stroke or break their leg or get a spinal cord injury.\"",
      "In the end, she said, \"people with disabilities actually bring value to a crew. ... You develop a very special resilience.\"",

      "People who understand AI and, equally important, who are adept at explaining how it works in simple terms, will find themselves in demand, Seamans predicted. For example, he expects companies to recruit what he calls \"AI explainers\" or \"AI translators\" who can help managers better understand an organization's AI tools.",
      "\"The job is to provide a simple layperson's understanding of what's happening under the hood,\" he said.",
      "\"They don't need to be the best computer scientist at creating and running large language models, but they need to understand enough about it so it's clear they're competent in that area and be able to talk about it to a broader audience,\" Seamans added.",
      "Another common role Seamans expects to emerge in the age of artificial intelligence is the \"AI auditor\" who\u00a0checks AI for bias or factual inaccuracies.",
      "\"They would need to know enough about an AI system to run tests on it, and know what benchmarks to use to determine whether bias is there or not,\" he said. \"They could potentially have a legal background, too.\"",
      "Seamans also expects employers to step up their hiring of instructors who can train workers on how to use a company's AI apps. His advice for workers, students and early-career employees?",
      "\"My encouragement would be for everyone to play around with AI and not assume there is one specific way you should be interacting with [AI],\" he said. \"Interact in a variety of ways because you'll get different answers.\"",

      "DraftKings said event contracts will be available for trading in 38 states and that the company will eventually expand beyond sports and finance into other markets, such as entertainment and culture. The sports betting company announced Friday it is debuting DraftKings Predictions, a mobile app and web product that will be regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.",
      "\"Along with our operational footprint, marketing and analytics infrastructure and advanced in-house technology, we believe we are uniquely positioned to lead this space over the long term,\" Corey Gottlieb, chief product officer of DraftKings, said in a statement.",

      "Some prediction market platforms lacking a license for sports wagering have faced pushback from state regulators. Event contracts traded on markets are regulated differently from sports bets, which are illegal in certain states.",
      "Others have criticized the move by prediction markets to facilitate speculation on sports.

      "\"Instacart misled consumers by advertising free delivery services \u2014 and then charging consumers to have groceries delivered \u2014 and failing to disclose to consumers that signed up for a free trial that they would be automatically enrolled into its subscription program,\" Christopher Mufarrige, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement.",
      "The FTC said Instacart's promise of free delivery to shoppers placing an order through the platform for the first time amounted to false advertising because the offer required that they pay a \"service fee\" to receive their groceries.",
      "Instacart also failed to stand behind its \"100% satisfaction guarantee\" because it implied that it offered full refunds for dissatisfied customers, which the company failed to provide, regulators allege.

    "story": [
      "A plane landed at Colorado's Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport without a pilot's help on Saturday in what appears to be the first real-world use of new safety technology. According to Garmin, their emergency \"Autoland\" system was activated for the first time ever for the landing at around 2 p.m. Saturday. The landing was successful and the charter company for the plane told CBS Colorado that everyone involved was OK.",
      "According to LiveATC and a pilot that heard the communication at the time, a robotic voice over air traffic control communication can be heard saying, \"Pilot incapacitation, two miles south\u2026 emergency Autoland in 19 minutes on runway 3-0.\"",
      "It came not long after taking off from Aspen's airport reported a pressurization problem while flying over the Denver Metro area.",
      "\"We lost pressurization,\" the pilot told air traffic control.",
      "Cases of pilot incapacitation are rare, but nearly always fatal. The Autoland system works with the push of a button and can be activated by anyone on board the aircraft or can self-activate after a prolonged period of no pilot activity.",
      "In the air traffic control audio, the same robotic voice can also be heard describing the flight's tail number as N479BR. On Flight Aware, this tail number is shown landing at Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport on Saturday afternoon, flying in from Aspen.",
      "Local flight instructor Adam Lendi was with a student when he says he heard the traffic over his radio and went out to see the plane land.",
      "\"We saw the fire trucks starting to head out,\" Lendi went on to explain, \"I was familiar with the auto land systems, and I recognized that's what was going on. So I told my student, I said, 'We might be witnessing something pretty cool here.'\"",
      "In a statement to CBS Colorado, Garmin said: \"Garmin can confirm that an emergency Autoland activation occurred at Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport in Broomfield, Colorado. The Autoland took place on Saturday, Dec. 20, resulting in a successful landing. We look forward to sharing additional details at the appropriate time.\"",
      "Flight Aware shows the operators of the plane that landed at that time as Buffalo River Aviation, who say everyone involved is OK, but did not clarify what happened or how many people were on board.",
      "Garmin's Autoland technology for a general aviation aircraft came out in 2019, and the company says this is the first time it's ever been activated.",
      "CBS News cameras were the first to be allowed on board to see the technology in action back in 2019 as it was being approved by the FAA.",
      "Larry Anglisano, an aviation journalist for AVBrief, described Autoland as a fail-safe for when the airplane is in working order but the pilot might not be able to take control. He says Autoland can even turn itself on if the pilot fails to interact with the system for a long period of time.",
      "\"This is a smart computer that's smart enough to know the pilot is incapacitated and smart enough to know where to put the airplane down for a safe landing based on the amount of runway that's needed; it'll fly around weather,\" Anglisano said.",
      "And on Saturday, the tech did just that as it brought anyone on board safely to the ground. Lendi says flights were kept out of the airspace for about an hour during this time.",
      "\"It's reassuring just to know that, if you know, as I progress in my flying career, that if I were in a situation where something happened to me, there could be an option for everybody in the plane to make it on the ground safely,\" Lendi said.",
      "CBS Colorado has reached out to the FAA and airport leadership for comment, but as of Sunday evening, had not heard back.",

      "DHS says all qualified participants who leave by Dec. 31, 2025, will also receive free airfare to their home countries and be waived of certain civil fines or penalties tied to remaining illegally in the U.S., if they voluntarily self-deport using the rebranded CBP Home app. The smartphone app is modeled off the Biden administration's CBP One platform.",
      "Under the Trump administration's policy, migrants are instructed to use the platform to signal their intent to depart. If determined to be eligible, DHS officials say they will receive travel assistance plus the $3,000 paid stipend once the U.S. government confirms the individual has left the country.",

      "DHS says the bonus stipend is part of a holiday season campaign aimed at accelerating removals and reducing taxpayer costs, with travel support typically considered less expensive than traditional detention and deportation operations. As of May 2025, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement estimated the average cost to arrest, detain and remove an undocumented migrant is approximately $17,000.",
      "As part of the self-deportation program, DHS says participants are deprioritized for ICE arrest and detention so long as they demonstrate \"meaningful strides\" toward leaving the U.S., though officials have not released detailed guidance explaining how long that protection lasts or how any compliance is judged.",

      "Will it be a white Christmas where you live?",
      "The best chances for a white Christmas this week in the U.S. are across the northern halves of Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota and the northern Great Lakes, according to Scott Kleebauer, a meteorologist at the Weather Prediction Center.",
      "\"Around the Adirondacks, across northern New England and into northern Maine. Those are the areas that look to be pretty good to have a white Christmas,\" he said.",
      "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration defines a white Christmas as at least 1 inch of snow on the ground on the morning of Dec. 25.",
      "Other areas may still \"hang on to the white Christmas idea\" despite longer odds, Kleebauer added.",
      "The chances decrease the farther west you go from Minnesota, and there's a very low chance of no snow across much of South Dakota, Iowa and the South.",
      "A substantial ridge of high pressure is expected to develop across the southern central Plains, Kleebauer said.",
      "\"That [ridge] is going to control so much of the weather pattern over the course of several days into next week, and we're going to see temperatures are going to be well above normal,\" he told CBS News on Friday.",
      "Temperatures will be well above normal all the way into Minnesota and the Dakotas, though some of those areas already have a decent snowpack.",
      "\"It's going to be really hard to melt all the snow, even with the warm temperatures across the northern latitudes up here across the upper Midwest,\" Kleebauer said.",
      "Overall, chances for a white Christmas will be limited farther South and West.",
      "\"The East is going to get a little bit lucky because it looks like the Northeast is going to remain at least near normal \u2014 they're going to kind of stay away from the worst of the ridge,\" he said.",
      "Widespread snow still remains limited. As of Friday, only about 22% of the Lower 48 states were covered by snow, according to NOAA.",
      "Look up the historical odds for a white Christmas where you are",
      "Historically, the northern tier of states near Canada has the highest chances of a white Christmas, along with parts of the East such as northern Maine and the northern Great Lakes, which are all \"pretty prone to having a white Christmas,\" Kleebauer said.",
      "The map below shows the historical likelihood of having at least 1 inch of snow on the ground on Christmas Day at weather stations across the United States, according to data from NOAA.",
      "It is based on the 1991-2020 U.S. Climate Normals, the most recent 30-year averages for climate measures such as temperature, precipitation, snowfall and freeze dates, calculated using observations from nearly 15,000 stations nationwide.",
      "Dark gray areas on the map indicate places where the probability of snow on Christmas typically has been less than 10%, while white areas show probabilities greater than 90%.",
      "Among major cities, Minneapolis-St. Paul has one of the highest chances of a white Christmas historically, at about 74%. Other northern cities have lower odds, including Cleveland (39%), Detroit (35%), Chicago (34%), Indianapolis (26%) and New York City (13%).",

    "summary": "Friends and colleagues of Rob Reiner sat down with CBS News to share personal anecdotes and fond memories of him following the news of his tragic death.",
    "story": [
      "Rob Reiner's circle was wide and eclectic, spanning comedians honing punchlines and Oscar-winning actors and filmmakers shaping Hollywood itself.",
      "As the son of comedy legend Carl Reiner, he entered the world of entertainment early, but went on to make a name for himself as a director, filmmaker, and actor in his own right.",
      "He's perhaps best known for his breakout role at age 23 as Archie Bunker's liberal son-in-law, Michael \"Meathead\" Stivic in the hit 1970s sitcom \"All in the Family,\" though others may know him more recently as Bob Day, the father of the quirky Jess Day in \"New Girl.\" Reiner also directed iconic films such as \"The Princess Bride,\" \"When Harry Met Sally\u2026,\" \"This is Spinal Tap,\" \"Stand By Me\" and \"A Few Good Men.\"",
      "Friends and colleagues who worked with Reiner through the years sat down with CBS News to share their personal anecdotes and fond memories of him following the news of his tragic death. Reiner and his wife, Michele, were found dead in their Los Angeles home on Dec. 14 and their son, Nick, was charged in their murders.",
      "Here's a look at some tributes from those who knew Reiner best, featured in \"CBS News: Rob Reiner - Scenes from a Life,\" a one-hour special\u00a0broadcast Sunday after \"60 Minutes\" on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Albert Brooks",
      "Albert Brooks said he's still in disbelief over the death of his good friend, who he's known since the pair attended drama class together at Beverly Hills High School more than 60 years ago. He said he was heartbroken, but he loves to talk about his friendship with Reiner because it's \"genuine and it's rare.\"",
      "\"Rob was my oldest friend. It's that simple. He's the person that I've known the longest. I met him when I was 14 years old. So I'm still in that not believing it stage,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Brooks said he still finds himself dialing his pal's number to chat, and then freezes when he realizes what he's done.",
      "\"I know it happened, but, you know, I'm driving around and all of a sudden \u2014 I actually two days ago, I called his number,\" he recalled.",
      "Kathy Bates",
      "Oscar-winning actress Kathy Bates has credited Reiner with changing \"the course of [her] life\" by directing her unforgettable performance as Annie Wilkes in \"Misery\" in 1990.",
      "\"If I hadn't done 'Misery,' it would be like George Bailey going back and seeing what his life would have been like if he had never been there,\" she said. \"I wouldn't have had some of the friends that I have now. I wouldn't have had the richness in my life. I quite frankly probably would have stayed in the theater and I doubt I would have had a movie career. I might have dropped out altogether.\"",
      "She recalled Reiner's enthusiasm when she walked on stage to accept her Oscar for Best Actress in 1991.",
      "\"When they called my name, I looked over and Rob was standing and he was just pounding his fist together going, 'Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!'\" she recalled.",
      "Kiefer Sutherland",
      "Kiefer Sutherland who played Lt. Jonathan Kendrick in the 1992 legal drama \"A Few Good Men\" said Reiner had an unforgettable presence on set as director. He recalled the tense courtroom scene where Jack Nicholson \u2013 Colonel Nathan Jessup \u2013 had to deliver his now famous line, \"You can't handle the truth!\"",
      "After the first moving take, Sutherland recalled Reiner asking Nicholson if he wanted to go again.",
      "\"No one said a word, and Rob went up to Jack Nicholson and whispered in his ear, 'Do you want to do another one?' And Jack Nicholson said, 'Well, we're here,'\" Sutherland recalled. \"So they did another one, and it was just as extraordinary.\"",
      "The actors planned a marathon filming day, but Sutherland said Reiner was so blown away by Nicholson's performance that day that he sent everyone home early.",
      "\"They had planned to shoot the whole day, and Rob looked at everybody and said, 'I couldn't ask for anything more, so you guys all have the rest of the day off,\" Sutherland said.",
      "Annette Bening",
      "Annette Bening played Sydney Ellen Wade, an environmental lobbyist and love interest of widower President Andrew Shepherd, portrayed by Michael Douglas in the 1995 political romantic comedy, \"The American President.\" During filming, Bening said Reiner made it a priority as the movie's director to ensure the cast and crew could spend quality time with their families.",
      "\"On the set, he had that kind of enthusiasm that is infectious. The leader sets the tone, right? So he was wonderful that way. And a real avid family man,\" Bening said.",
      "She added, \"He would insist that the day ended at a sane time, which in show business is kind of unusual. But, he said, 'No, we want everyone to be able to have dinner with their kids.'\"",
      "Michael Douglas",
      "Like Reiner, Michael Douglas was also born to Hollywood royalty, the son of Kirk Douglas.",
      "\"Well, my experience was, watching him, that I could never be the man that my father was. He could do everything, you know, I mean he was Spartacus. Once you go into the same business, it stares you in the face,\" Douglas said. \"And, in Rob's case, are you as funny as your father? But that I think is also what created his tenacity, his strength, and that's something that's not really talked about enough with Rob, about his endurance.\"",
      "Douglas said Reiner was \"spectacular\" to work with in \"The American President.\" \"He was looking out for you,\" he said.",
      "Jerry O'Connell",
      "When Jerry O'Connell was 11, he was cast as the shy but loyal Vern Tessio in the 1986 coming-of-age drama \"Stand by Me.\" He met Reiner for the first time at his audition for the film, and recalled Reiner putting him at ease. He said Reiner was like a father figure to him during that time, and the years after.",
      "Months after the movie came out, when he was 12 years old, O'Connell said Reiner took him out to lunch in Los Angeles.",
      "\"He took me out to lunch, man. He didn't have to do that, You know what I'm saying? It was months after the movie came out. He was a busy man, and he took a 12-year-old me out to lunch. Just to be like, 'Thanks so much. What a great movie,'\" O'Connell recalled, with tears in his eyes. \"That lunch meant so much to me, you know? It's just stuff that kids need to hear.\"",
      "Mandy Patinkin",
      "Mandy Patinkin played Inigo Montoya, a Spanish swordsman, in Reiner's 1987 film adaptation of \"The Princess Bride.\" It was the role of a lifetime.",
      "After wrapping up filming, Patinkin said the cast was invited to come out to Los Angeles to see the first rough cut together. When the film was over, Patinkin turned in the screening room and said he \"never dreamed\" he would get to be in something like this.",
      "\"I didn't even have time to dream it. And he made that dream for me. And I don't go anywhere, where some child or adult or grandfather comes up to me and says, 'Say the line,'\" said Patinkin of his famous line, \"Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father. Prepare to die.\"",
      "The word that came to min when Patinkin heard the news about Reiner and his wife, Michele: \"Inconceivable.\" He said he doesn't know how to process it and he's not looking to understand how to process it.",
      "\"Rob worked hard to try to get me the best human being I could be. One time he said to me, 'I just wish you could get out of your own way.' And I haven't been able to achieve that to this day, but I won't quit trying. He cared about my nature. He showed it to me over and over again,\" Patinkin said. \"I believe that we can connect with Rob and Michele. And every time we're thinking about this or talking about it or anybody tells a story, he's here. He's here with you. He will not be forgotten.\"",

    "story": [
      "At least 15 files that were released by the Justice Department Friday in relation to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were no longer available on the department's website on Saturday, CBS News has determined.",
      "CBS News downloaded the complete set of documents on Friday and compared it to what is available Saturday.",
      "It was unclear why the files are missing. CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department for comment.",
      "In a social media post to its X account Saturday night that seemed to touch on the issue, the DOJ wrote: \"Photos and other materials will continue being reviewed and redacted consistent with the law in an abundance of caution as we receive additional information.\"",
      "One of the missing files showed a mass of framed photos on a credenza desk. The photos showed former President Bill Clinton, and another was of the pope. In an open drawer, there was a photo of President Trump, Epstein, and Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell.",
      "On Sunday, the Justice Department said the Southern District of New York had flagged the image of the framed photos for potential further action to protect victims and it had been put back online.",
      "\"Out of an abundance of caution, the Department of Justice temporarily removed the image for further review,\" the Justice Department said in a statement. \"After the review, it was determined there is no evidence that any Epstein victims are depicted in the photograph, and it has been reposted without any alteration or redaction.\"",
      "Other missing files included photos of a room with what appeared to be a massage table and nude photos and nude paintings.",
      "The episode has deepened concerns that had already emerged from the Justice Department's much-anticipated document release. The tens of thousands of pages made public offered little new insight into Epstein's crimes or the prosecutorial decisions that allowed him to avoid serious federal charges for years, while omitting some of the most closely watched materials, including FBI interviews with victims and internal Justice Department memos on charging decisions.",
      "Some of the most consequential records expected about Epstein are nowhere to be found in the Justice Department's initial disclosures, which span tens of thousands of pages.",
      "Missing are FBI interviews with survivors and internal Justice Department memos examining charging decisions \u2014 records that could have helped explain how investigators viewed the case and why Epstein was allowed in 2008 to plead guilty to a relatively minor state-level prostitution charge.",
      "The records, required to be released under a recent law passed by Congress, hardly reference several powerful figures long associated with Epstein, including Britain's former Prince Andrew, renewing questions about who was scrutinized, who was not, and how much the disclosures truly advance public accountability",
      "Among the fresh nuggets: insight into the Justice Department's decision to abandon an investigation into Epstein in the 2000s, which enabled him to plead guilty to that state-level charge, and a previously unseen 1996 complaint accusing Epstein of stealing photographs of children.",
      "The releases so far have been heavy on images of Epstein's homes in New York City and the U.S. Virgin Islands, with some photos of celebrities and politicians.",
      "There was a series of never-before-seen photos of Clinton but fleetingly few of Mr. Trump. Both have been associated with Epstein, but both have since disowned those friendships. Neither has been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein and there was no indication the photos played a role in the criminal cases brought against him.",
      "Despite a Friday deadline set by Congress to make everything public, the Justice Department said it plans to release records on a rolling basis. It blamed the delay on the time-consuming process of obscuring survivors' names and other identifying information. The department has not given any notice when more records might arrive.",

    "published": "Sun, 21 Dec 2025 18:10:22 -0500",
    "summary": "NASA is gearing up to send four Artemis astronauts on looping test flight around the moon in 2026.",
    "story": [
      "Four astronauts in training to fly around the moon early next year strapped into their Orion spacecraft this weekend for a dress rehearsal countdown in a major milestone toward launch.",
      "Based on repeated stops and starts seen on NASA's countdown clock, the complex test originally planned for late November, ran into problems at various points on Saturday. NASA provided no details, but Artemis 2 commander Reid Wiseman said that overall, the test went well.",
      "\"Extremely successful day in our spacecraft #Integrity,\" Wiseman said in a post on X. \"Did everything go perfectly? Absolutely not. But this vehicle and our team showed us they're up to the challenge. Launch is getting very close.\"",
      "Launch is tentatively targeted for early February, but the schedule is extremely tight and the flight may slip to early March. No decisions are expected until after the first of next year.",
      "In any case, Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch and Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen, wearing bright orange pressure suits, strapped into their Orion capsule using the same procedures they'll follow on launch day.",
      "Such \"countdown demonstration tests\" have traditionally taken place shortly before launch with the rocket and crew ship already on the launch pad. But for Saturday's test, the astronauts boarded their spacecraft atop NASA's huge Space Launch System (SLS) rocket inside the cavernous Vehicle Assembly Building at the Kennedy Space Center.",
      "Over the course of the exercise, the astronauts and the launch control team worked through the same countdown procedures they will follow on launch day, ending less than a minute before the clocks would normally hit zero.",
      "Five launch opportunities are available in February when the moon and Earth are in the proper relative positions. The first such opportunity comes on Feb. 6. To make that date, the SLS rocket and Orion would have to be rolled from the assembly building to pad 39B in mid January, setting the stage for a critical fueling test that must go well before NASA can proceed to launch.",
      "Given the amount of work remaining to complete preparations, sources say NASA may opt to delay the flight to early March.",
      "Whenever it takes off, the flight plan calls for the Orion and its crew to spend 25 hours in an elliptical orbit around Earth to test spacecraft life support, propulsion and navigation systems.",
      "The crew plans to fly in close proximity to the SLS rocket's upper stage to test the Orion's maneuvering systems and rendezvous procedures that will be needed for eventual moon landing missions.",
      "An uncrewed Orion carried out a similar loop around the moon during the Artemis 1 mission in November 2022. But the Lockheed Martin-built spacecraft was not equipped with a full life support system and it did not carry out thruster firings like those needed for a rendezvous.",
      "Once the testing is complete, the Artemis 2 Orion will leave Earth orbit on a \"free return\" trajectory that will carry the crew around the moon and back to a Pacific Ocean splashdown. The ship will not go into orbit around the moon.",
      "But Artemis 2 will still be the first piloted trip back to the moon since the Apollo 17 mission in 1972, carrying Wiseman and his crewmates farther from Earth than any other humans have ever traveled.",
      "The flight will set the stage for Artemis 3, carrying yet-to-be-named astronauts to the surface of the moon near the lunar south pole, NASA hopes, in 2028.",
      "The Artemis 3 flight originally was planned for 2024, a target set during the first Trump administration. But the mission has been repeatedly delayed by processing problems, slowdowns during the COVID pandemic, Super Heavy-Starship testing and work to develop the lunar lander, known by NASA as the Human Landing System, or HLS.",
      "The current 2028 target was set in the past few weeks when it became apparent the space agency would not be ready in time for the most recent previous target of 2027.",
      "China also plans to land its own \"taikonauts\" on the moon by 2030, creating a new space race of sorts, one that NASA vows to win.",

    "story": [
      "Georgetown men's basketball coach\u00a0Ed Cooley\u00a0was suspended by the school on Sunday for one game after throwing a water bottle into the stands that apparently hit a child at the end of a loss to Xavier the night before.",
      "\"I met with Coach Cooley today to discuss the incident which occurred after last night's game against Xavier. I expressed that his conduct did not align with the standards we expect of our coaches, nor does it reflect the values of Georgetown Athletics or Georgetown University,\" Georgetown athletic director Lee Reed said in a written statement. \"As a result, Coach Cooley will be suspended for the next game vs. Coppin State. Associate head coach Jeff Battle will coach the team.\"",
      "The Hoyas fell to 8-4 and 1-1 in Big East Conference play with their 80-77 loss against visiting Xavier on Saturday. As the final buzzer sounded, Cooley grabbed a water bottle, wheeled around and flung it toward spectators. The bottle traveled on a line drive and appeared to hit someone.",
      "A video of the moment shows the person who was hit appeared to be a child sitting on a woman's lap,\u00a0CBS Sports reported.",
      "Cooley apologized at the postgame press conference to the family of the child, saying it was \"out of character\" for him to get that upset.",
      "\"I am deeply sorry for my actions during last night's game, and sincerely apologize to the Nyahkoon family, whom I have known for years and regard as my own family. My conduct was unacceptable and does not represent who I am or the leader I strive to be,\" Cooley said Sunday in a statement. \"I want to also apologize to the Georgetown community, team, fans, the league and my family. I take full responsibility for my actions and their consequences. I will learn from this experience to ensure it never happens again.\"",
      "Battle will be in charge at the on-campus McDonough Arena when Georgetown hosts Coppin State on Monday night.",
      "The Big East released a statement shortly after Georgetown announced it was punishing Cooley.",
      "\"We have communicated with Georgetown leadership and support their decision to suspend head men's basketball coach Ed Cooley for his actions following last night's game against Xavier,\" the conference said. \"The safety and security of spectators and participants at Big East events is of paramount importance and fundamental to the enjoyment of our games.\"",
      "Cooley is in his third season with the Hoyas after coaching for 12 years at conference rival Providence.",
      "Georgetown is 35-43 since Cooley arrived.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington. And this week on \"FACE THE NATION,\" the long-awaited release of the Epstein files. And will that good news about inflation improve America's views about President Trump's handling of the economy?",
      "President Trump is wrapping up the year with a tighter focus on the economy and affordability, both in the Oval Office and on the midterm's campaign trail, boasting of his 2025 accomplishments.",
      "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): This is a far better term than it would have been had I done it the most traditional way. It really is. It's more powerful term. It's a more powerful term. And the biggest news of all is yesterday it was announced that inflation is far lower than anybody expected. I told you.",
      "(END VIDEO CLIP)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's an exaggerated claim, but any sign of prices going lower is good news for Americans. Our new CBS poll shows that half the country says Trump's policies are making them financially worse off. We'll ask White House Chief Economic Advisor Kevin Hassett about that and more.",
      "Plus, a bipartisan conversation with the two members of Congress who pushed to pass the law calling for the Epstein files to be made public. Has the Trump administration obeyed that law? We'll talk about Kentucky Republican Tom Massie and California Democrat Ro Khanna.",
      "Finally, we'll talk with the head of UNICEF, Catherine Russell, about the children of Sudan and Gaza.",
      "It's all just ahead on \"FACE THE NATION.\"",
      "Good morning and welcome to \"FACE THE NATION.\"",
      "So far there have been few surprises in the tens of thousands of documents related to the case against convicted sex offender and accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein and his partner, convicted child sex offender Ghislaine Maxwell. The Justice Department says that 1,200 names identified as victims or their relatives were redacted, along with materials that could result in their identification. Will the release of the documents satisfy Congress and the political forces who lobbied for their disclosure and, much more importantly, will it satisfy the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein and their families?",
      "The two House members who pushed their colleagues into passing the bill to release these documents, Republican Thomas Massie, who's in Garrison, Kentucky, and Democrat Ro Khanna, who joins us this morning from Palo Alto, California.",
      "It's good to have you both of you here.",
      "I want to start with you, Congressman Massie, because in these past 48 hours we have seen the Justice Department acknowledge it's an incomplete release, but they have put out more than 13,000 files. They say more will come.",
      "This isn't everything you asked for just yet, but would you acknowledge that they are supplying with the spirit, if not the intent of your law?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE THOMAS MASSIE (R-KY): No, they're flouting the spirit and the letter of the law. It's very troubling, the posture that they've taken. And I won't be satisfied until the survivors are satisfied.",
      "You know, I said in the hours leading up to this release that we will know if they are complying if they implicate any of the other criminals that are involved in the \u2013 suspects that are involved. The witnesses, the victims themselves have given to the FBI, and they've never been mentioned.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there are some disclosures in here that seem new, Congressman Khanna. The documents confirm that the FBI received a complaint about Jeffrey Epstein back in 1996, but the woman whose name is Maria Farmer, who made the complaint, said federal officials failed to follow up. She said the disclosure makes her feel redeemed and that this was one of the best days of her life, to see these documents made public. What action do you want taken around a case like this?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA (D-CA): That was the single most important disclosure of what we got. I know Maria's sister, she sounded the alarm in 1996. She complained to the FBI. The problem is that Epstein was so connected with law enforcement and powerful politicians, the FBI did nothing for a decade. Frankly, she deserves compensation. She deserves an explanation.",
      "But the broader point is, Blanche was on this morning saying that Massie and I have a problem that it's taking too long. That's not the problem. The problem is, this was a slap in the face of survivors. What do they want? They want to know, who are the rich and powerful men who visited Epstein's rape island and covered up the abuse. And the key documents that our law basically said needed to be released, the 60-count indictment that actually implicates a lot of these people, and the prosecution memo were not released. It's not about the timeline, it's about the selective concealment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, yet, right, the deputy attorney general said there are more disclosures that will be made. You believe that they will not release that particular part? I mean you did give them some leeway for redactions.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, first of all, the redactions were excessive. And even Harvard Law professors who have looked at that have said you can't redact internal communications, you can't redact workforce product. And the courts are going to find that these were excessive.",
      "But my point, and I'm sure Congressman Massie can elaborate, is that we want the files out. So, if our sounding the alarm on what is missing is going to help them get those files out, fine. But this shouldn't be a big document dump. There's a pretty simple point, who raped these young girls, who covered it up and why are they getting away with it?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you are saying specific things regarding the indictment Congressman Massie, I saw in a video that you posted, you had a very specific benchmark of success here. You said you know there are at least 20 men accused of sex crimes known to the FBI. How do you know that number? And do you know those names?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE THOMAS MASSIE: Yes, the survivors lawyers have told me those numbers and they've described their professions in general. But they've only given me one of those name. And I mentioned that in a congressional hearing, Jeff Staley (ph). So, I searched these documents. I didn't see Jeff Staley's name. Nor did I see 19 other names.",
      "And here's why we shouldn't be optimistic that Blanche or Bondi are going to release these thing. They sent a six-page memo to Congress and said that \u2013 they cited pre-existing laws as reasons that they weren't going to follow our law. For instance, our law requires them to release information regardless of embarrassment. But they are trying to say that a previous law prevails when it doesn't. Common sense says it doesn't. The privacy act doesn't protect them from that. And then also, as Ro said, internal communication. Those \u2013 they're using a FOIA standard that doesn't apply because our law already says they have to give us internal communications.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. In terms of the gentleman there, you referenced as accused, I mean, being in the document doesn't necessarily prove criminal behavior, right? And in terms of the redactions, what the deputy attorney general said is that they were abiding by your law. And also a judge in New York had ordered them to listen to victims. So, they're claiming that information that they had initially even published Friday, they had to pull down because they were trying to protect victims. You aren't \u2013 you don't sound convinced that they are abiding by, you know, this intent.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE THOMAS MASSIE: No, actually \u2013 no, they are not abiding. And all three judges who released the grand jury materials said that our law trumps the prior law. That's just common sense. Law school 101. Yet, Todd Blanche is using a different theory that wouldn't survive first contact with any court, which is, he's trying to say that prior laws override our law. That's not the way this works.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. What are you going to do about it to force them to comply? I mean can you do anything?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE THOMAS MASSIE: Oh, absolutely. Look, people have talked about \u2013 and by the way, Todd Blanche is the face of this. But it's really the attorney general's office, Pam Bondi, who is responsible. And there are several ways to get at this. Some take longer. Some are shorter.",
      "The quickest way, and I think most expeditious way to get justice for these victims is to bring inherent contempt against Pam Bondi. And that doesn't require going through the courts. And give her \u2013 you know, and basically Ro Khanna and I are talking about and drafting that right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Well, I mean, on another network this morning Democratic Senator Tim Kaine said impeachment or contempt, it is premature, Congressman Khanna. And the depth attorney general said bring it on. They don't seem to be taking it very seriously. And if you just don't have the math in the Senate, including at least now this Democratic senator not being convinced, doesn't that sort of show that you're at the limit of pressure?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: No, we only need the House for inherent contempt. And we're building a bipartisan coalition. And it would fine Pam Bondi for every day that she's not releasing these documents.",
      "I'll tell you why \u2013 I've talked to the survivors, why this is such a slap in the face. One of the survivors said they released her name accidentally but they still have not released the FBI file about the people who abused her at her request. And the problem here is that there are rich and powerful people \u2013 we all know this, there are 1,200 victims, they're rich and powerful people who either engaged in this abuse, covered it up or were on this island. And what the American people want to know is, who are these people. And instead of holding them accountable, Pam Bondi is breaking the law. And this is the corrupt system, the Epstein class that people are sick of.",
      "So, I believe we're going to get bipartisan support in holding her accountable and a committee of Congress should determine whether these redactions are justified or not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's sometime in January when you all come back, I assume, that that will happen.",
      "I want to ask you, though, Congressman Khanna, there have been images released in the past 48 hours, some of them include former President Bill Clinton. There's at least one image of Donald Trump. I should say neither man has been accused of any wrongdoing related to Epstein, though they clearly knew him.",
      "But since Friday's publication \u2013 we're showing the image here now \u2013 one of the pictures was pulled down. There were 15 images total that were then redacted from the DOJ website. And it's kind of hard to see, but it's an open drawer with a photo of President Trump.",
      "Why do you think that was pulled down? Because the deputy attorney general says this was victims saying that their privacy or somehow their integrity was being compromised by having that image published.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, I'm less concerned about that photo. I don't know the facts. My concern is the major documents that we know are out there that haven't been released. The 60 count indictment that shows massive financial fraud and foreign interference. The prosecution memo. And look, they put out these Bill Clinton pictures \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Foreign interference?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, there are allegations that there are foreign governments that potentially were involved. And that all needs to come out. And it needs to come out in the indictments. It needs to come out in the prosecution memos.",
      "But the reality is, they put out these pictures of Bill Clinton. Fine, put it all out, but don't distract from the fundamental issue, which is, who are these powerful people who visited rape \u2013 rape island? I mean there are 1,200 victims. It defies common sense that it was just Epstein and Maxwell. And they're hiding something. And you know why the American people are so upset. My X account had MAGA supporters supporting me for the first time, saying, you know, Pam Bondi whiffed, according to Susan Wiles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: She is breaking the law. She needs to be held accountable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're referring to the \"Vanity Fair\" quote that the chief of staff gave, saying, the \"whiffed.\" And she said that Pam Bondi gave them \"binders full of nothingness.\" And then when it came to the client list she said it was on her desk, \"there is no client list,\" quote, \"and it sure as hell wasn't on her desk.\"",
      "Do you see that as an acknowledgment here though that the politics have overtaken the substance?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: No. For us it's about the survivors. And if you look at Thomas Massie and my comments the morning of the release, we were giving Todd Blanche the benefit of the doubt. We said if it's not all there, fine, just get the information out. It's when the survivors said that this is an insult, this is a slap in their face, that we aren't getting \u2013 the truth about who these men were on the \u2013 on rape island, that we started sounding the alarm. And this is more documents of nothingness.",
      "And I guess the question the American people have, even to me, is, is the system so corrupt, is the system so corrupt that Thomas Massie and you defy the odds, pass a bill through a discharge petition, get the Senate, get the president to sign it, and still these rich and powerful people are being protected. Who has this kind of hold on our government? What are they hiding? Why are they not releasing this?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you want, what, people involved in those initial investigations down in Florida reexamined and possibly prosecuted?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: I want the information out which was in that prosecution memo that Acosta disregarded, that were in those indictments. There were 60 counts against Epstein. Only two counts were prosecuted. I want to know, who were these other people who were on the Epstein's rape island, who were the people who saw young girls being paraded around at parties, 13, 14, 15-year-olds and didn't say anything, and why is it so hard when there's a law requiring these names to come out. What we're seeing is survivors' names come out but not the men who abuse them. And instead of \u2013 instead of holding elites accountable, Pam Bondi is break the law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will see when you gentlemen come back to work sometime in January what your next measures are. It sounds like you've made it clear you're moving action against the attorney general.",
      "Thank you both for your reaction today.",
      "\"FACE THE NATION\" will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the economy and our executive director of elections and surveys, Anthony Salvanto.",
      "Good morning. Good to have you here.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the president was speaking throughout the past week about the economy, even in this Oval Office address. He's trying to reframe public perception of what's going on. We know sentiment has been low for years now. Do people really expect that a president can fix everything in the first year?",
      "ANTONY SALVANTO: So, let me start with that big context because it's so important. Yes, through 2025 people have said they thought the economy was bad. When you talk about going back years, this goes back to before the pandemic was the last time that a majority of Americans said the economy was good. So, we are in this long and a lot of people think structural change that the economy has gone through. Things got more expensive coming out of the pandemic and people still are trying to adjust to those higher costs. That's what underpins all those sentiments.",
      "Now, the political part of this is coming into 2025 more people did think that Donald Trump would fix it. The expectations were high. We measured that back in January. Right now you have this less than one in five that feel like his policies have made them financially better off. And even when you ask people then to look ahead to 2026, it's a little bit better, but it's not overwhelming that people think his policies will make them better off.",
      "So, there's this real disconnect there. And if you come back to the description of the economy, people right now, I ask them to just grade it, and they give it a C, a D or even worse, which is different than a lot of the times the way the administration has described the economy. That sets up the fundamental challenge I think you saw that this week for \u2013 in the address.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, it's not a new tactic for a current president to blame the last one for all the problems of today. But we checked and in that primetime address the president said it was Biden's name, Biden's fault about seven times. Does the public buy that?",
      "ANTONY SALVANTO: Well, when you pick up on what we've just talked about, this long-term trend, the president did inherit economy where people thought \u2013 a majority of people thought it was bad. At the same time, right now more people say the current economy is Donald Trump's responsibility. He's the one, it's on his watch right now.",
      "Having said that, he had been declining on his handling of the economy throughout the year. That's leveled off now in recent weeks. And one thing you do find is, yes, there's this disconnect. People think he is describing it as better than it really is. Maybe there's political credit to be gained by starting to address what people are feeling.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, one thing we know is that health care costs for both private insurance users and government insurance users is going to be up. Congress is still debating what to do about the Obamacare act. But how much public focus is there on this issue?",
      "ANTONY SALVANTO: So, if you look at the most immediate part of that argument, a big majority thinks that Congress should extend those added subsidies. But in the wider context of this, when we asked people, how do you feel about trying to afford all these various aspects, these basics, cost of living, health care is one of the ones that stands out that a lot of people say they have trouble affording.",
      "And I think you're picking that up in the general sentiment of how people process health care, health insurance costs as well. It's a very important part, obviously, of people's budgets, but also one that they tell us that concerns them a whole lot.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, one of the structural changes you sort of alluded to earlier is the change coming from artificial intelligence. You were looking at this. We've seen a lot of discussion about how it's reshaping things. Are Americans sort of digesting that? How do they understand it?",
      "ANTONY SALVANTO: Yes, we've been following this all year because, right, it's driving stock market gains. There's a lot of investment in it as well.",
      "Right now you see a lot of uncertainty from the public about it. On one hand, when I ask people, what parts of the economic sectors are you most at least optimistic about? Technology stands out as people being optimistic about it in general. But with regard to A.I. in particular, more people tell us they think it's going to decrease jobs than increase them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the number of corporations forecasting a lot of spending on technology in the new year.",
      "What do all these dynamics mean politically for the midterm races in 2026?",
      "ANTONY SALVANTO: So, let me start with the president because one thing I asked heading into 2026, is there anything that the president could do to change your mind about them? And there are a substantial number of people that say, yes. Perhaps not surprisingly, when I follow and ask, well, what would that be about, they say it's the economy.",
      "The reason that's important is, in the dynamic here, a president is always key. He's not on the ballot, but he's always on people's minds in a midterm year. So, that's the first thing to watch. But the other one, you know, if you're at your holiday gathering and people are arguing about what's going to happen, who's going to win, I think it's too far to know for certain. But at the same time, we can already see the conditions and the playing field that people will be fighting on. And that's clearly cost of living. It's clearly health care, among other things. And it's the race to define how people evaluate it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony Salvanto, thank you for this.",
      "ANTONY SALVANTO: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to the director of the White House National Economic Council Kevin Hassett.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT (National Economic Council Director): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We took you literally. You said last Sunday you'd come back and talk to us about that household survey, the jobs picture. You said you really trust it. That report came out. It showed America added 64,000 jobs with unemployment ticking up to 4.6 percent.",
      "But we've seen analysis, including from the top economist at U.S. Navy Federal saying the U.S. is in a, quote, \"hiring recession. Very few jobs being added since the spring and wage gains are slowing.\" Are we in a hiring recession?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: No, I don't think so. I think that basically the number was about what the market expected. It was a number that was less than 100, which is a little bit lower than you'd like. But then, after that, we got the Consumer Price Index numbers, which were really amazing. And so, if you look at the three-month moving average of core consumer prices, then they're running at an annual rate of about 1.6 percent, way below the Fed's target.",
      "And my old friend all the way back to grad school, Austan Goolsbee, who's now one of the Fed governors voting on interest rates, conceded that they should have cut rates faster, and that he's going to do so in the future because of this inflation number.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. He was one of the dissenters when the Fed's decision came out.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when it comes to inflation, as you just referred to, that number showed there was still a rise in inflation. It was just at a slower pace than expected. If you pull out energy and pull out food, it rose at the slowest pace since 2021, up 2.6 percent in November from a year ago. But then there are quirks in here because it looks like the prices weren't gathered until Thanksgiving discounts kicked in. There was no increase reflected in terms of houses costs. Why do you trust the data now when you haven't in the past?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Oh, you know, I think that you're right to always be suspicious about data. And it will look a lot cleaner when we get a full survey, which we didn't have these \u2013 that time. But, you know, two of the three numbers, if we go back to the three month moving average, were fine. And so, I think that the error band around the 1.6 percent inflation, about that's the \u2013 the pace is running, is probably pretty tight. Surely there will be some revisions, but I think the numbers are about right.",
      "And I usually, Margaret, don't like to go to year over year when we're talking about what's going on with inflation because that includes a lot of high inflation Biden months in the back, and, you know, fewer and fewer as we get, you know, further into the year. But I think that the trajectory right now is best seen by the three month moving average. And that's below two, below the Fed target. So it means the Fed, as Austan Goolsbee said, has plenty of room to cut rates.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. But the president said inflation has stopped. You'd acknowledge that's an exaggeration.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, I guess the inflation being above the target has stopped for sure. And so inflation is not zero also. That's fair.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. He did not give those caveats. He just said, inflation has stopped.",
      "Kevin Hassett, stay with us. I've got to take a quick break and I want to talk about the rest of what we've learned.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: OK.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with a lot more \"FACE THE NATION.\" White House Adviser \u2013 economic Adviser Kevin Hassett is standing by, and we'll hear from the new head of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and also Catherine Russell, executive director of UNICEF. She's just back from Sudan.",
      "So, stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to \"FACE THE NATION.\"",
      "And we continue our conversation now with the director of the White House National Economic Council Kevin Hassett. This past week we saw the president announce further changes to immigration policy. He halted diversity visas. There are now 39 countries on this travel ban or restricted list. This is in addition to all the deportations and revocations of asylum.",
      "The business community has made clear that the constant changes make it hard for them to plan, particularly in small business categories. They're concerned about a labor shortage. And we've seen the U.S. workforce lose more than one million foreign-born workers in the past year. Are you hearing those concerns from the business community?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT (DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL): Actually, it's the opposite. So, in the sense that native born workers are up more than two million. And so what we've seen is that as foreign-born workers, and a lot of them, don't forget, were illegal immigrants that have been deported, when foreign-born workers depart, then it creates jobs for people who are native-born.",
      "The interesting thing too, which I'd like to remind everybody, is that native-born Americans aren't necessarily racially distinct at all. And so, the majority of the native-born jobs that have been created over the last year are Hispanic Americans. It's, you know, just basically taking folks that are legally in the country and getting the jobs to them is what we see in the data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Associated General Contractors of America didn't say they're replacing those workers easily. They're saying they're having a hard time doing that, and issued a statement saying it's a significant challenge, urging the administration to lock at ways to expand the construction workforce and allow more people to lawfully enter the country.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right. Well, one of the things we're seeing, this is exactly how markets work, right? So, construction workers, their salaries this year have gone up by $3,300 on average according to the latest report. And \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because of scarcity?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, but when the price goes up, then people say, oh, I should \u2013 I should go and I used to be a construction worker but now I'm doing something else, I should go back to construction work because the salaries are so high. And so we're seeing a lot of that go on. And so we're very bullish on construction and really happy to see that wages are going way back up.",
      "And so, instead of having, you know, basically illegal people come in and take jobs away from native-born Americans at low languages, we're seeing people re-enter the labor force at high wages.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to be clear, from the business community, part of the question is what is legal because you're changing the definition and pulling back asylum from some groups. So, there is confusion of the constant change in policy. Will there be clarity in the new year?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Oh, there will definitely be clarity in the new year. And I think there's clarity now that what we've done is that we've made it so that people are legally residents of the country and legally allowed to work, that they're, you know, basically top of the list when you're looking for somebody to hire.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you a bit about tariffs. Since as far back as July we have heard the president refer to this idea of $2,000 checks being given out to households. The treasury secretary said this would go to households making less than $100,000. Should Americans plan to receive those checks in 2026?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: That's going to depend on what happens with Congress. Congress is going to have to send those monies to those people. But the thing we can say is that since July we've had a lot of positive news about the economy. We've had a couple of quarters of almost four percent growth. We've got a big government surplus actually running for a few months in a row. The deficit relative to last year is down by $600 billion.",
      "And so, in the summer I wasn't so sure that there was space for a check like that, but now I'm pretty sure that there is. And so, I would expect that in the new year the president will bring forth a proposal to Congress to make that happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, a new proposal for these. It's not necessarily coming from existing tariff revenue?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Oh, well, it could come from tariff revenue. But in the end, you know, we get taxes, we get tariffs, we get all \u2013 revenue from lots of places, and then Congress decides how to spend those monies, that's an appropriation. It's \u2013 this would have to be money that would an appropriation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. So, don't bank on it, in other words.",
      "So, are you projecting that in the new year certain tariffs will remain in place, or do you see some of them going away?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I think that most of the tariffs that we passed this year have proven their metal. We've got still high growth, which people said we couldn't if we had tariffs. We have reduction in the deficit. Reduction in the trade deficit. Imports from China are the lowest they've been since China entered the WTO. So, there's a lot of success to crow about in the tariff space.",
      "But there are also thing that we're hearing when we talk to people, like trading partners and companies that trade a lot in the U.S., There are also things that maybe could be adjusted. You saw that we decided to exempt coffee, for example, because we don't make a lot of coffee in the U.S. And so I think that \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And coffee prices are up.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And I think that if there's something that's not made in the U.S. at all, that there's an appetite, and Jamieson Greer is leading the effort to study these matters, there's an appetite too exempt things if they're really not meant to be made in the U.S. because of, you know, like climate or things like that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've also go \u2013 got the Supreme Court decision pending in terms of the specific IEEPA, as they're called. These are tariffs where the justification was citing fentanyl, Canadian crude, some Chinese imports. If the Supreme Court doesn't find in your favor, who gets the refund? Is it the companies or is it the consumers? How does that work?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes, you know, we really expect the Supreme Court is going to find with us. And I also think that if they didn't find with us, then it's going to be pretty unlikely that they're going to call for widespread refunds because it would be an administrative problem to get those refunds out there. But basically, whoever paid the tariff, like actually cut the check to buy the thing, would be the person who would be getting the refund if there were one.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Doesn't the administration claim it was the country that paid that? You're saying the company?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: It would be \u2013 like I'm talking \u2013 I'm not talking about the incidents, right? The \u2013 like, so the incidents of the tariff, so in the end who pays the tariff depends on the elasticity of supply and demand. We know that China cut the price a lot so that the post-tariff price from Chinese goods is about what it was before the tariff. But the people who pay the tariff \u2013 if there is a refund, the people who actually paid for the good, the importer in most cases, they're the ones who would be the first line of defense for refunding the tariff.",
      "But I really, really don't think that's going to happen. It would be very complicated. And then that person would be responsible for allocating the tariff refund to the appropriate folks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That sounds like a mess.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes, it is a mess. And that's why I think the Supreme Court wouldn't do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Well, we'll wait and see.",
      "I want to quickly ask you about the oil market. I asked you last Sunday about that decision to seize a tanker off the coast of Venezuela. We saw yet another one over the weekend. You said last Sunday it probably won't affect oil prices to be taking this oil off the black market. Do you stand by that? And was all that oil going to China?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes. You know, I haven't been briefed on the latest. I did see that this is another ship that was basically operating on the black market. And so there have been a little bit \u2013 there's been a little bit of black market activity in the oil sector to go to sanctioned countries and to get them some oil. And they're getting that oil in order to avoid, you know, the reforms that we think would make the countries a better place. And so, it's not a lot of oil compared to world supply. And so, I don't think that people need to be worried here in the U.S. that the prices are going to go up because of these seizures of these ships. There's just a couple of them. And they were black market ships.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Were these sanctioned ships going to China?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I'm not sure where they were going.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Kevin Hassett, thank you for your time.",

      "Catherine Russell, UNICEF's executive director, is just back from Sudan and South Sudan.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL (Executive Director, UNICEF): Good morning, Margaret. How are you?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm well. But you are \u2013 we want to draw attention here to those in need. And I know Secretary of State Marco Rubio just, on Friday, called for a cessation of hostilities. He said the U.S. is pushing for a humanitarian truce to allow some of these aid organizations to operate, but aid convoys have been struck on their way in, he also acknowledged. What kind of challenges are you facing?",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: Well, Sudan is, at this moment, the largest humanitarian crisis we're facing. And there are many things happening there. One is that children in particular, but people are on the move. Millions of people are moving around the country. We have hunger, extreme hunger, including famine, designated in certain parts of the country. We're also seeing just horrific levels of violence, excuse me, including rape, including against children. UNICEF did a report about that about a year ago. Even children under the age of one. Absolutely terrible stories.",
      "And a woman I met in Chad, who had fled Darfur, told me about the effort to sort of rape women in front of their families and their communities. Really trying to terrorize them. And videotaping it to humiliate them. And so, the levels of violence are horrific. You have children out of school. So, the bottom line here is that the needs are enormous. The challenges are just absolutely staggering. And I think the world needs to come together, you know, in the short term for sure we need better humanitarian access. We need to reach all of these communities. That's hard to do right now.",
      "But the truth is, Margaret, that what I heard from children across Sudan was the same thing, which is, I would say to them, you know, what do you think about what do you want? And they all said the same thing, which is, we want peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: I think they understand that the only answer here really is to solve the political problems so that people can get back to some sort of a decent life.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I just \u2013 I don't want to let go what you just mentioned in terms of why something like that would be done to children and to women in front of their families. The term genocide is used in Sudan. What you are describing there in terms of treatment of gender-based violence, it sounds like you are saying, that is an attempt to destroy a society by carrying out rape.",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: I mean they are definitely atrocities that are intended to terrorize communities, to force them to move, to scare them. And, you know, they're effective strategies for sure. And I think, you know, the world needs to take a look \u2013 I mean Sudan, I know it seems so far away. And it is in many ways. But it is also a place where children are suffering so enormously. And I think especially, you know, now we're in the holiday season, you know, you want to think about, you know, people being with their families, all the rest of it. I mean children in so many places are not \u2013 are not having those sort of luxuries. They are really suffering. And I think the world needs to pay attention to that. And I commend, you know, Senator Rubio, Secretary Rubio now, for pointing this out because I think the key thing here is that we need attention to the problem.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the U.S. has historically been the largest donor to UNICEF. But we've seen tremendous cuts by this administration, including $142 million claw back of congressionally approved funds. Secretary Rubio said no one died from these aid cuts. And on Friday he said he's very proud of the changes that were made in foreign aid. Tell us what the realty is of the funding cuts.",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: Yes, the funding cuts are challenging. And I think that the issue to understand is it's not just the United States. It's almost every donor to \u2013 certainly to UNICEF but to the U.N. system broadly, and to humanitarian sector. And so when you add all of those together, the impacts are really dramatic because it means what, you know, what \u2013 what financial support we do get, we have to spread now over more places and with less support from donor countries.",
      "So, I think, you know, there are certainly, you know, there have been and will probably always be catastrophes that we're trying to deal with. And children are suffering. And the United States has always proudly led, I think, on humanitarian response and on helping children. And, you know, we're hopeful that some of the money that has been taken back will be restored to us. We continue to work with the State Department. There are efforts to fund a lot of the humanitarian and sort of life-saving work that we do. But really, you know, the needs around the world are just absolutely enormous. And it's the United States and other donors would have to come in behind that, along with the private sector, I have to add that. That is also an important piece of this puzzle.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. And I should point out that the U.S. is one of the largest foreign aid donors to South Sudan, but that foreign aid is also under threat at this moment because of the government not complying with what the U.S. is demanding.",
      "Let me quickly \u2013",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: Yes, South Sudan is a challenge.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: I was just there too. And that is \u2013 you know, the government there needs to do a better job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, can I \u2013 quickly, before I let you go, Gaza. How are things improving?",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: Well, again, I would say thanks to the ceasefire and the administration here was critical in doing that, things have gotten a bit better. We are able to move around better.",
      "But, you know, there's tremendous misery. The challenges for me, we have a lot of work that needs to get done. I mean you've seen all of the images, the destruction. You know, we still have serious levels of malnutrition. We are trying to get shelter in place. You know, there's rain and just misery for children all around. So, I think, you know, would \u2013 I would say there definitely is progress with the ceasefire. God willing that holds.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",

      "(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Father, I want to ask you about this role you have at the head of the Conference of Bishops. Last month there was this urgent message. It was a very rare statement addressing concern for the evolving situation impacting migrants. And the language was pretty sharp in it. Quote, \"we oppose the indiscriminate mass deportation of people. We pray for an end to dehumanizing rhetoric and violence, whether directed at immigrants or at law enforcement.\"",
      "What are bishops that you talk to seeing in perishes all around the country? What triggered this?",
      "ARCHBISHOP PAUL COAKLEY (President, U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops): I think it varies from place to place for sure. So, in communities with a more dense migrant population, there's a great deal of fear and uncertainty. Anxiety because of the level of rhetoric that is often employed when addressing usually around migration and the threats of deportation. So, there's a lot of anxiety. So, our pastors are trying to accompany people, walk with people, reassure people, and that's the message of the church. And that was the reason for our special message in November that we're with you, we hear you, we're aware of your suffering and your fears, and we fully intend to accompany you during this difficult time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I know there have been bishops in places like Charlotte, in parts of California, who have formally granted permission or dispensation is the word used for people who skip Sunday mass if they're afraid they could be targeted by ICE. Are you actually seeing a decline in the number of people attending mass because they're afraid they'll be arrested?",
      "ARCHBISHOP PAUL COAKLEY: We are not seeing that here in Oklahoma. And I haven't heard it reportedly widely from my brother bishops. So, I know that that is the case in some places. But I don't think it's as common, at least here locally, or in places that I have personal contact with. There's a \u2013 there's an anxiety, there's a fear. But I don't think it's kept people away in great numbers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, this video that you released really got a lot of attention. It certainly got ours. And it mentioned being troubled by threats against the sanctity of houses of worship, as well as hospitals and schools. You know, I spoke to the vice president, J.D. Vance, last year and asked him about this change in policy that would allow for ICE to enter churches and schools. And he really pushed back hard. He says that the catholic church receives funds to help re-settle immigrants, thus they are motivated by financial and not humanitarian reasons.",
      "Have you had any kind of conversation with the Trump administration, with the vice president, to explain what it is you're trying to say?",
      "ARCHBISHOP PAUL COAKLEY: I have not had any personal conversations at this point with either the president or the vice president. So, I look forward to engaging with them over matters of mutual concern and certainly undoubtedly the question of immigration is going to come up, I think. We have opportunities to work together. We have opportunities to speak frankly with one another. So, I will look forward to that in the \u2013 in the near future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the vice president calls himself a devout catholic, which is also why I ask. I mean do you \u2013 what do you say to Catholics like him who argue that these hardline immigration policies have had a result that they sought, that the end justifies the means?",
      "ARCHBISHOP PAUL COAKLEY: I don't think we can ever say that the end justifies the means. We have to treat everyone with respect. Respect of human dignity. Dignity of every person. There's no conflict necessarily between advocating for safe and secure borders and treating people with respect and dignity. We always have to treat people with dignity. God-given dignity. The state doesn't award it. And the state can't take it away. So, it's from the creator.",
      "So, I think, as Christians, as believers, we \u2013 that's kind of a foundational bedrock thing for us, that people are to be respected and treated with dignity, whether they are documented or undocumented, whether they are here legally or illegally, they don't forfeit their human dignity.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what is it that you think is causing that to be an issue right now? Why do you think that there is a loss of dignity? Are there specific policies that you are thinking of when you say that?",
      "ARCHBISHOP PAUL COAKLEY: Well, not necessarily. I mean I just \u2013 to treat people with respect. To afford them due process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "ARCHBISHOP PAUL COAKLEY: The deportations that are \u2013 that are happening around the country can \u2013 it's instilling, as I said, fear in a rather widespread manner. So, I think that's \u2013 that's something that concerns us all, that people have a \u2013 have a right to live in security and without fear of random and \u2013 of deportations. I think we're believers, of course, in due process. We have provisions in law that award due process to everyone. So, that's what we are wanting to emphasize.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What would you advise others, other people of faith, to do for these immigrants?",
      "ARCHBISHOP PAUL COAKLEY: Well, we are a nation of immigrants ourselves. So, I think that's something that we, as Americans, need to always come back to. We are founded upon the immigrant experience. So, I think we need to be generous in welcoming immigrants. We certainly have a right and a duty to respect borders of our nation. And I would say remind all of us that we have a right and a duty to respect sovereign borders of a state. But we also have a responsibility to welcome immigrants. This is kind of a fundamental principle in catholic social teaching regarding immigration and migration. People have a right to remain in their homeland, but they also ought to be allowed to migrate when conditions in their homeland are unsafe and necessitate moving to a place where they can find peace and security.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Lawmakers who led the push to compel the release of the files related to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein criticized the Justice Department's release of an initial tranche of files and photos Sunday, advocating for survivors seeking more key documents about individuals involved in the abuse.",
      "Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California called the release a \"slap in the face of survivors.\"",
      "\"It's not about the timeline, it's about the selective concealment,\" Khanna said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "On Friday, the Justice Department began disclosing thousands of files, facing a deadline to release all the files in accordance with a law signed earlier this year. The files included new images of prominent figures and of Epstein's travels and various homes. They also include grand jury transcripts from the various cases brought against Epstein and his associates. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the Justice Department would continue to release the files over the next couple weeks.",
      "The disclosures sparked scrutiny from survivors and some lawmakers, who argue that the files should have been released in full by the Dec. 19 deadline.",
      "Khanna clarified that for him, the problem isn't \"that it's taking too long,\" but rather that the Justice Department hasn't hasn't released \"key documents\" that survivors are seeking that Khanna said implicate the \"rich and powerful men who visited Epstein's rape island and covered up the abuse.\"",
      "Khanna also called the redactions to the released files \"excessive.\" CBS News found that at least 550 pages in the initial release of the documents were fully redacted. The Justice Department has defended its release and claimed the redactions made were required by law.",
      "GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who appeared alongside Khanna on \"Face the Nation,\" said the Justice Department is \"flouting the spirit and the letter of the law.\"",
      "\"It's very troubling the posture that they've taken,\" Massie added. \"And I won't be satisfied until the survivors are satisfied.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department for comment and will update this story with any response.",
      "Friday's release came after years of pressure from lawmakers and survivors, which ramped up in recent months as they sought transparency around the government's investigations into Epstein after the Justice Department said in a July internal review that it found no \"client list.\" Khanna and Massie led the charge in Congress, earning support on a discharge petition to force a vote on a measure that compelled Attorney General Pam Bondi to release the files. President Trump signed the bill into law last month.",
      "Massie outlined the possible next steps Sunday, saying \"the quickest way, and I think most expeditious way, to get justice for these victims is to bring inherent contempt against Pam Bondi.\" The Kentucky Republican said he and Khanna are \"talking about and drafting that right now.\" Khanna added that the two men are \"building a bipartisan coalition, and it would fine Pam Bondi for every day that she's not releasing these documents.\"",
      "\"We want the files out.\" Khanna said. \"There's a pretty simple point: Who raped these young girls, who covered it up, and why are they getting away with it?\"",
      "Massie has pointed to 20 alleged co-conspirators, a number he said he heard from the survivors' lawyers. Massie said the lawyers have \"only given me one of those names,\" which he said during a congressional hearing in September was Jes Staley, the former CEO of Barclays Bank. Staley has denied wrongdoing and said he regrets befriending Epstein.",
      "Khanna said \"there are rich and powerful people who either engaged in this abuse, covered it up, or were on this island. And what the American people want to know is who are these people?\"",
      "\"Instead of holding them accountable, Pam Bondi is breaking the law, and this is the corrupt system, the Epstein class, that people are sick of,\" Khanna said. \"So I believe we're going to get bipartisan support in holding her accountable. And a committee of Congress should determine whether these redactions are justified or not.\"",

    "summary": "The Justice Department released thousands of new photos and records on Jeffrey Epstein on Friday, but at least 550 pages in the documents were fully redacted.",
    "story": [
      "The Justice Department released thousands of new records on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein on Friday, but at least 550 pages in the documents were fully redacted in the initial release, CBS News has found.",
      "The newly released files included photos of several prominent people in Epstein's orbit, images from his homes and investigative records that detail disturbing allegations against the late sex offender. But the heavy redactions in many of the records have drawn criticism from Democrats and some Republicans, as the department defends its handling of the files.",
      "One series of three consecutive documents \u2014 totaling 255 pages \u2014 is entirely redacted, with each page covered by a black box. A fourth 119-page document labeled \"Grand Jury-NY\" is also entirely redacted.",
      "At least 180 blacked-out pages appear in files that are mostly but not entirely redacted. In some cases, a cover page, a\u00a0photo of a folder\u00a0or\u00a0something else that isn't fully redacted\u00a0precedes several pages that are entirely obscured by a black box.",
      "The Justice Department said on X a largely unredacted version of the 119-page document was included in another tranche of files that were released on Saturday. The document is a transcript from the grand jury proceedings involving Epstein's convicted co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell.",
      "It's unclear if any other documents that were mostly or entirely redacted on Friday were released in an unredacted form Saturday. CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department for more details but did not immediately receive a response.",
      "\"Documents and photos will continue to be reviewed consistent with the law and with an abundance of caution for victims and their families,\" the Justice Department said Sunday.",
      "In other cases, the redactions were more sparing. For example, a 96-page police report on a Florida investigation into Epstein in the mid-2000s redacts the names of victims and other details, but leaves many other details in. The 119-page grand jury transcript that was published Saturday takes out names and identifying information, but leaves in almost everything else.",
      "And some of the thousands of photos included in Friday's release are partially redacted, with some people's faces obscured by boxes. Photos that include former President Bill Clinton, pop star Michael Jackson and other notable people have partial redactions (though Clinton and Jackson themselves are fully visible).",
      "Why was the DOJ allowed to redact Epstein files?",
      "The Epstein Files Transparency Act, passed by Congress last month, requires the Justice Department to release the files in its possession related to Epstein and Maxwell.",
      "Redactions are allowed for a handful of reasons, including to protect survivors' personal information and to leave out violent photos and child sexual abuse material. Documents can also be withheld in a \"narrowly tailored and temporary\" manner if their release would \"jeopardize an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution.\"",
      "Some of Friday's redactions appear to black out the names of survivors, but it's not clear in every case why information was blacked out. The government is required to give Congress a list of redactions within 15 days.",
      "The law explicitly forbids the government from withholding records due to the risk of \"embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity.\" The Justice Department said on X that no politicians' names were redacted from the files.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in a letter to Congress earlier Friday that a team of more than 200 Justice Department lawyers scoured the documents in search of survivors' names and other things that needed to be redacted. He said the department is still going through the files and will release more of them on a \"rolling basis,\" though the law required them to be released by Friday.",
      "Blanche's letter also said \"additional layers of review\" were necessary when reviewing grand jury transcripts. Judges in New York and Florida have given the government permission to release grand jury transcripts from Epstein's and Maxwell's cases, but the judge overseeing the Maxwell case required the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan to \"personally certify\" that none of the documents contain victims' personal information.",
      "Democrats criticize the redactions in Epstein files",
      "Some lawmakers have blasted the Justice Department for the redactions and for acknowledging that some documents will be released later.",
      "Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who helped lead the effort to pass the Epstein Files Transparency Act, argued that Friday's document release wasn't in compliance with their law.",
      "Khanna called it an \"incomplete release with too many redactions\" in a video posted to X. He said he's \"exploring all options,\" including impeachment or referrals for prosecution. Massie said the release \"grossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said: \"Simply releasing a mountain of blacked out pages violates the spirit of transparency and the letter of the law. For example, all 119 pages of one document were completely blacked out. We need answers as to why.\"",
      "The Justice Department has defended its handling of the files. Blanche told Fox News Digital: \"The only redactions being applied to the documents are those required by law \u2014 full stop.\"",
      "\"Democrat administrations in the past have refused to provide full details of the Jeffrey Epstein saga,\" Blanche said in his letter to lawmakers. \"But President Trump, Attorney General Bondi, and FBI Director Patel are committed to providing full transparency consistent with the law.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Powerball jackpot climbed to an estimated $1.6 billion \u2014 the game's fourth-largest prize ever \u2014after another drawing passed Saturday night without a winner. The winning numbers were 4, 5, 28, 52 and 69 with a Powerball of 20.",
      "The jackpot now has an estimated cash value of $735.3 million, Powerball said. In addition to the fourth-largest Powerball prize, it's also the fifth-largest among U.S. lottery jackpots.",
      "Although no tickets were sold that matched all six winning numbers at Saturday night's drawing, there were eight tickets that matched five of them, Powerball said. The prize for those tickets is $1 million each, except for ones sold in California, where one of the eight tickets was purchased. Another 112 tickets purchased ahead of the drawing won $50,000 prizes, and 22 tickets won $150,000 prizes, according to the game.",
      "\"Powerball is giving players a chance to dream bigger than ever this holiday season,\" said Matt Strawn, Powerball Product Group chair and Iowa Lottery CEO.",
      "Monday's drawing will be the 46th since the last time a jackpot was won \u2013 the longest such Powerball run. A $1.787 billion jackpot was hit Sept. 6 in Missouri and Texas.",
      "To win the grand prize, a ticket must match the five white balls pulled during the drawing as well as the red Powerball. A single jackpot winner would have the choice of taking a lump sum payment estimated at $735.3 million or opting for a payout via an annuity, which would consist of one immediate payment followed by 29 annual payments that increase by 5% each year.",

    "published": "Sat, 20 Dec 2025 21:21:27 -0500",
    "summary": "German engineer Michaela Benthaus is the first person with a significant physical handicap to reach space.",
    "story": [
      "In a space-age milestone, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin launched a wheelchair-using engineer and handicap advocate to the edge of space Saturday, a 10-minute trip that allowed her to enjoy a few minutes of weightlessness more than 65 miles above Earth.",
      "Michaela Benthaus, a German aerospace engineer who suffered a spinal cord injury in a 2018 mountain biking accident, joined a retired SpaceX manager and four entrepreneurs for the up-and-down flight to a point just above the so-called \"boundary\" of space.",
      "\"It was the coolest experience!\" she said after landing, joking about turning upside down in weightlessness. \"I didn't only like the view and the microgravity, but I also liked the going up. That was so cool, every stage of going up.\"",
      "Benthaus was assisted during training and inside the Blue Origin capsule by Hans Koenigsmann, a former SpaceX manager and engineer who was instrumental in the development of that company's workhorse Falcon family of rockets.",
      "A fellow German by birth and a naturalized U.S. citizen, Koenigsmann helped arrange Benthaus' flight after meeting her last year.",
      "\"I met Hans the first time online,\" Benthaus said in a Blue Origin interview. \"I just asked him, like, you know, you worked for so long for SpaceX, do you think that people like me can be astronauts?",
      "\"Then he reached out to Blue Origin and told me oh, Blue actually is very excited about it. Okay, I have my doubts on it, but let's see. Thankfully it turned out we can do it. So Hans and me (ended) up flying as a team,\" Benthaus continued.",
      "Koenigsmann said Benthaus \"basically inspired me to do this. It's her drive that kind of convinced me I should do that, too, and to just experience something that I've seen from the outside for a long time.\"",
      "Benthaus was able to make her own way from her wheelchair into the New Shepard capsule before launch, scooting along a bench extending from the hatch that was provided by Blue Origin. Koenigsmann was strapped in nearby to offer assistance during the flight if needed.",
      "Running two days late because of last-minute technical issues, the countdown ticked smoothly to zero Saturday and the New Shepard blasted off from Blue Origin's West Texas launch pad at 9:15 a.m. EST.",
      "Accelerating straight up into a mostly clear sky, the capsule's single-stage booster reached a velocity of nearly three times the speed of sound before its hydrogen-fueled BE-3 engine shut down about two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff.",
      "At that point, the New Shepard capsule was released to continue coasting upward on its own, and the crew, now weightless, was free to briefly unstrap and float about the cabin.",
      "Benthaus' legs were strapped together to keep them in place, but she, too, was free to enjoy the thrill of weightlessness as the New Shepard coasted up to a peak altitude of slightly more than 65 miles, well above the 62-mile-high point where aerodynamic forces no longer have any effect.",
      "At that altitude, the \"sky\" is deep black and Earth's horizon is sharply curved. Passengers are able to take in the view through the largest windows ever flown in space.",
      "\"Oh, my God,\" one passenger could be heard exclaiming over the capsule's radio.",
      "\"Incredible,\" another said.",
      "Falling back into the lower atmosphere, the crew was warned to get back in their seats to strap in before the onset of atmospheric deceleration. Maximum deceleration subjects New Shepard crews to about five times the normal pull of gravity.",
      "The booster, meanwhile, followed a similar trajectory, falling tail first back toward the launch site. Nearing the ground, the BE-3 engine re-ignited, landing legs deployed and the rocket settled to an on-target touchdown on a concrete pad near the launch gantry.",
      "The New Shepard came down under three large parachutes, landing in a cloud of dust near the booster and its launch pad. Blue Origin support personnel quickly reached the spacecraft to help the crew exit.",
      "Joining Benthaus and Koenigsmann aboard the New Shepard were physicist-investor Joey Hyde, entrepreneur Neal Milch, adventurer Jason Stansell and Adonis Pouroulis, a South African entrepreneur and mining engineer.",
      "All six waved, smiling broadly as they climbed out of the capsule one at a time. Benthaus was last out, carried from the spacecraft by Koenigsmann and a member of Blue Origin's recovery team to a nearby wheelchair.",
      "\"You should never give up on your dreams, right?,\" she said after landing. \"I just feel very lucky, and I'm very grateful to Blue and Hans and everyone who said yes to this journey.\"",
      "Blue Origin does not publicly disclose the cost of a New Shepard seat, but the price is thought to be upwards of $500,000 each. How Benthaus' seat was financed was not revealed.",
      "Saturday's launch marked Blue Origin's 16th New Shepard flight with passengers aboard since Bezos, his brother and two others blasted off on the first such flight in July 2021. Including Saturday's flight, Blue Origin has now launched 92 men and women to space, including six who have flown twice.",
      "While Benthaus was the first person with a significant physical handicap to fly in space, European Space Agency astronaut John McFall, who has a prosthetic leg, has been cleared for selection to a future flight to the International Space Station.",
      "Benthaus said before launch the reaction to her flight aboard the New Shepard was mostly positive, saying she hopes more handicapped people might make their way to space.",
      "The big question for NASA and other space agencies and private companies is not so much whether handicapped astronauts can carry out their duties in the weightless environment of space. It's more about how they can handle an emergency that might require a speedy exit from their spacecraft, either on the ground or in space.",
      "In an interview with CNN, Benthaus said \"we're thinking more and more about long-duration space missions; some of us want to go to the Mars in the future.\"",
      "\"That's a very long journey. And, yes, people can get a disability on the way. People can have a stroke or break their leg or get a spinal cord injury.\"",
      "In the end, she said, \"people with disabilities actually bring value to a crew. ... You develop a very special resilience.\"",

      "Robert Seamans, a professor of management and organizations at the NYU Stern School of Business, thinks such roles are just the kind of new job that AI will create. Indeed, he expects AI to be a part of virtually every worker's future, much like the internet became an integral part of daily life decades ago.",
      "Meanwhile, the workers best positioned to benefit as generative AI tools like ChatGPT reshape the labor market will be those who understand how to use the technology to maximize their own performance, as well as how to test and train AI, Seamans said.",
      "\"AI will change the vast majority of the work we do, but it will affect each occupation in different ways,\" he said. \"A good analogy is to think about computers and the internet and how that changed jobs and the way we work.\"",
      "People who understand AI and, equally important, who are adept at explaining how it works in simple terms, will find themselves in demand, Seamans predicted. For example, he expects companies to recruit what he calls \"AI explainers\" or \"AI translators\" who can help managers better understand an organization's AI tools.",
      "\"The job is to provide a simple layperson's understanding of what's happening under the hood,\" he said.",
      "\"They don't need to be the best computer scientist at creating and running large language models, but they need to understand enough about it so it's clear they're competent in that area and be able to talk about it to a broader audience,\" Seamans added.",
      "Another common role Seamans expects to emerge in the age of artificial intelligence is the \"AI auditor\" who\u00a0checks AI for bias or factual inaccuracies.",
      "\"They would need to know enough about an AI system to run tests on it, and know what benchmarks to use to determine whether bias is there or not,\" he said. \"They could potentially have a legal background, too.\"",

    "summary": "Sports betting companies face mounting competition from rapidly growing prediction markets such as Kalshi and Polymarket.",
    "story": [
      "DraftKings is entering the red-hot prediction markets business, launching technology that lets users trade contracts linked to sporting and financial events.",
      "DraftKings said event contracts will be available for trading in 38 states and that the company will eventually expand beyond sports and finance into other markets, such as entertainment and culture. The sports betting company announced Friday it is debuting DraftKings Predictions, a mobile app and web product that will be regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.",
      "\"Along with our operational footprint, marketing and analytics infrastructure and advanced in-house technology, we believe we are uniquely positioned to lead this space over the long term,\" Corey Gottlieb, chief product officer of DraftKings, said in a statement.",
      "DraftKings said its app, which is expected to be available in major app stores within days, will connect with multiple exchanges, starting with the derivatives marketplace CME Group.",
      "Once they have a DraftKings account, users can enter the DraftKings Predictions app and start trading by clicking on the yes/no questions associated with an event, such as an NFL game, and deciding how much money they want to wager.",
      "More specifically, users originate the trades, while DraftKings acts as a broker, Jeanine Hightower-Sellitto, the general manager of DraftKings Predictions, told CBS News.",
      "\"We're handling that order and it's getting sent to an exchange for it to be executed,\" she explained.",
      "DraftKings faces growing competition from prediction markets \u2014 including Kalshi and Polymarket, now valued at $9 billion and $11 billion, respectively \u2014 that enable users to speculate on the outcome of sports and other events.",
      "In October, DraftKings\u00a0announced\u00a0the acquisition of Railbird Technologies, a federally regulated prediction market. At the time, DraftKings said the deal supports its \"broader strategy to enter prediction markets.\"",
      "Some prediction market platforms lacking a license for sports wagering have faced pushback from state regulators. Event contracts traded on markets are regulated differently from sports bets, which are illegal in certain states.",
      "Others have criticized the move by prediction markets to facilitate speculation on sports. Charlie Baker, the president of the NCAA, recently called out Kalshi on\u00a0social media\u00a0after the company filed forms to accept bets on the transfer decisions and status of student-athletes, saying it would threaten \"competition integrity and recruiting processes.\"",
      "\"We certify markets all the time that we do not end up listing,\" Kalshi said on X\u00a0on Dec. 18. \"We have no immediate plans to list these contracts.\"",
      "Headquartered in Boston, DraftKings was launched in 2012 as a sports entertainment and gaming company. Among its offerings are a fantasy sports product, which allows users to build virtual sports team lineups and compete against other users, and a mobile sports betting platform called DraftKings Sportsbook, where customers can place bets on sports, players, leagues and events.",

      "Melbourne, Australia \u2014 A man accused of killing 15 people at Sydney's Bondi Beach obtained firearms training in New South Wales state outside Sydney with his father, according to Australian police documents released on Monday.",
      "The documents, made public following Naveed Akram's video court appearance from a Sydney hospital where he has been treated for an abdominal injury, said the two men recorded footage justifying the meticulously planned attack.",
      "Officers wounded Akram at the scene of the Dec. 14 shooting and killed his father, 50-year-old Sajid Akram.",
      "The state government confirmed Naveed Akram was transferred Monday from a hospital to a prison. Authorities identified neither facility.",
      "The 24-year-old and his father began their attack by throwing four improvised explosive devices toward a crowd celebrating an annual Jewish event at Bondi Beach, but the devices failed to explode, the documents said.",
      "Police described the devices as three aluminum pipe bombs and a tennis ball bomb containing an explosive, gunpowder and steel ball bearings. None detonated, but police described them as \"viable\" IEDs.",
      "The pair had rented a room in the Sydney suburb of Campsie for three weeks before they left at 2:16 a.m. on the day of the attack. CCTV recorded them carrying what police allege were two shotguns, a rifle, five IEDs and two homemade ISIS flags wrapped in blankets.",
      "Police also released images of the gunmen shooting from a footbridge, providing them with an elevated vantage point and the protection of waist-high concrete walls.",
      "The largest IED was found after the gun battle near the footbridge in the trunk of the son's car, which had been left draped with the flags.",

      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said last week that the\u00a0attack was inspired by ISIS, and there is an ISIS-affiliated militant group operating in a remote area of the Philippines.",
      "But a receptionist at a hotel in Davao City told CBS News the attackers never left their room for more than a day.",
      "Authorities have charged Akram with 59 offenses, including 15 counts of murder, 40 counts of causing harm with intent to murder in relation to the wounded survivors and one count of committing a terrorist act.",
      "The antisemitic attack at the start of the eight-day Hanukkah celebration was Australia's worst mass shooting since a lone gunman killed 35 people in Tasmania state in 1996.",
      "The New South Wales government introduced draft laws to Parliament on Monday that Premier Chris Minns said would become the toughest in Australia.",
      "The new restrictions would include making Australian citizenship a condition of qualifying for a firearms license. That would have excluded Sajid Akram, who was an Indian citizen with a permanent resident visa.",
      "Sajid Akram also legally owned six rifles and shotguns. A new legal limit for recreational shooters would be a maximum of four guns.",
      "Police said a video found on Naveed Akram's phone shows him with his father expressing \"their political and religious views and appear to summarise their justification for the Bondi terrorist attack.\"",
      "The men are seen in the video \"condemning the acts of Zionists\" while they also \"adhere to a religiously motivated ideology linked to (ISIS),\" police said.",

      "White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly said on social media that the vessel on Saturday was \"a falsely flagged vessel operating as part of the Venezuelan shadow fleet to traffic stolen oil and fund the narcoterrorist Maduro regime.\"",
      "In a statement on Saturday, the Venezuelan government condemned the vessel's seizure, saying it was a \"serious act of piracy.\"",
      "\"The colonialist model that the U.S. government seeks to impose through such practices will fail and be defeated by the Venezuelan people,\" the statement said.",
      "It added that \"these acts will not go unpunished,\" and that Venezuela \"will exercise all corresponding actions, including the complaint to the United Nations Security Council, other multilateral agencies and the governments of the world.\"",
      "President Trump last week called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or depart Venezuela. It is part of the ongoing pressure campaign against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.",
      "Earlier this month, sources told CBS News the U.S. military had\u00a0seized a sanctioned 20-year-old oil tanker that had just left port in Venezuela.",
      "Kevin Hasset, director of the White House's National Economic Council, said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the first two oil tankers seized were operating on the black market and providing oil to countries under sanctions.",
      "\"And so I don't think that people need to be worried here in the U.S. that the prices are going to go up because of these seizures of these ships,\" he added. \"There's just a couple of them, and they were black market ships.\"",
      "The targeting of tankers comes as Mr. Trump has ordered the Defense Department to carry out a series of attacks on vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean that his administration alleges are smuggling fentanyl and other illegal drugs into the U.S. At least 104 people have been killed in 28 known strikes since early September.",

    "story": [
      "Thousands of mourners gathered under tight police security at Sydney's iconic Bondi Beach on Sunday evening to mark a week since two gunmen targeting a Jewish festival killed 15 people. Since then, Australian governments have been galvanized into action on countering antisemitism and tightening already strict national gun controls.",
      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, his predecessors John Howard and Scott Morrison, and Governor-General Sam Mostyn, who represents Australia's head of state King Charles III, were among the dignitaries at the commemoration that drew more than 10,000 people.",
      "\"This has to be the nadir of antisemitism in our country,\" New South Wales Jewish Board of Deputies President David Ossip told the crowd. \"This has to be the moment when light starts to eclipse the darkness.\"",
      "The crowd booed Albanese when Ossip acknowledged his presence. Opposition leader Sussan Ley, who had said that a conservative government led by her would reverse a decision made by Albanese's center-left Labor Party government this year to recognize a Palestinian state, was cheered.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has lashed out at Albanese over the attack on the Hannukah celebration, saying \"your call for a Palestinian state pours fuel on the antisemitic fire.\" Netanyahu has repeatedly sought to link widespread calls for a Palestinian state, and criticism of Israel's military offensive in Gaza following Hamas' 2023 attack, to growing incidents of antisemitism worldwide.",
      "A national Day of Reflection to honor the victims",
      "Images of the victims, aged 10 to 87, were projected at the commemoration. \"Waltzing Matilda\" was sung in honor of the youngest victim, whose Ukrainian parents gave their Australian-born daughter what they described as the most Australian name they knew.",
      "A widely acclaimed hero of the massacre, Ahmed al Ahmed, sent a message of support from his hospital bed. In video that has been viewed millions of times around the world, the Syrian-born immigrant was\u00a0seen tackling one of the gunmen, wrestling the man's shotgun from his grip and turning it on the attacker. On Tuesday, Albanese said \"Ahmed al Ahmed represents the best of our country.\"",
      "\"The Lord is close to the broken-hearted. Today I stand with you, my brothers and sisters,\" he wrote.",
      "His father, Mohamed Fateh al Ahmed, was invited to light a candle on the Jewish candelabrum known as a menorah on the final night of Hannukah.",
      "Beyond the famous beach, people around Australia united with Sydney's stricken Jewish community by lighting candles and observing one minute of silence at their homes at 6:47 p.m. to remember the moment the massacre unfolded. Television and radio networks across Australia also fell silent.",
      "The federal and New South Wales state governments declared Sunday a national Day of Reflection to mark Australia's worst mass shooting since 35 died in Tasmania state in 1996.",
      "Albanese had earlier announced a review of federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies following last week's attack, which was inspired by the Islamic State group.",
      "Indigenous leaders held a traditional smoking ceremony on Sunday morning at the waterfront Bondi Pavilion, where an impromptu memorial has grown as flowers and heartfelt messages have accumulated. The memorial is to be cleared on Monday.",
      "Mostyn, the governor-general, accepted an invitation from the National Council of Jewish Women for women of all faiths to lay a flower at the memorial on Sunday morning. Hundreds of women and girls dressed in white joined her in making the gesture.",
      "She later delivered a message from the British monarch saying he and Queen Camilla were \"appalled and saddened by the most dreadful antisemitic attack on Jewish people the Hannukah celebration on Bondi Beach.\"",
      "Tight security at Bondi Beach",
      "One of the suspects, Naveed Akram, 24, was shot by police. He has been charged with 15 counts of murder and 40 counts of causing harm with intent to murder in relation to those wounded. His father, Sajid Akram, 50, was shot dead by police at the scene.",
      "The Health Department said 13 of those wounded at Bondi remained in Sydney hospitals on Sunday.",
      "Police bolstered security around Bondi on Sunday, including officers armed with rifles. There was criticism that the first police responders last week were armed only with Glock pistols, which did not have the lethal range of the assailants' shotguns and rifles. Two police officers were critically wounded.",
      "Flags flew at half-staff on the Sydney Harbor Bridge and government buildings, which were lit in yellow on Sunday night in a show of solidarity with the Jewish community.",
      "Executive Council of Australian Jewry co-chief Alex Ryvchin said the victims' families felt \"tragically, unforgivably let down\" by government failures to combat a growth in antisemitism in Australia since the war between Israel and Hamas began in 2023.",
      "A day after the attack, an emergency meeting of federal and state leaders committed to tightening national gun laws with measures including limiting the number of guns an individual can own. Sajid Akram legally owned six guns, including the two shotguns and two bolt-action rifles used at Bondi.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Dec. 21, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to the Director of the White House National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, good morning to you.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT, DIRECTOR NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We took you literally. You said last Sunday you'd come back and talk to us about that household survey, the jobs picture. You said you really trust it. That report came out. It showed America added 64,000 jobs, with unemployment ticking up to 4.6%. But we've seen analysis, including from the top economist at us, navy, federal, saying the US is in a quote, hiring recession. Very few jobs being added since the spring, and wage gains are slowing. Are we in a hiring recession?",
      "HASSETT: No, I don't think so. I think that basically, the number was about what the market expected. It was a number that was less than 100 which is a little bit lower than you'd like. But then after that, we got the consumer price index numbers, which were really amazing. And so if you look at the three month moving average of core consumer prices, then they're running at an annual rate of about 1.6% way below the Fed's target. And my old friend, all the way back to grad school, Austin Goolsby, is now one of the Fed governors voting on interest rates, conceded that they should have cut rates faster and that he's going to do so in the future because of this inflation number.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He was one of the dissenters when the Fed's decision came out. But when it comes to inflation, as you just referred to, that number showed there was still a rise in inflation, it was just at a slower pace than expected. If you pull out energy and pull out food, it rose at the slowest pace since 2021 up 2.6% in November from a year ago. But then there are quirks in here, because it looks like the prices weren't gathered until Thanksgiving discounts kicked in. There was no increase reflected in terms of housing costs. Why do you trust the data now, when you haven't in the past?",
      "HASSETT: Oh, you know, I think that you're right to always be suspicious about data, and it'll look a lot cleaner when we get a full survey, which we didn't have this time. But you know, two of the three numbers, if we go back to the three month moving average, we're fine. And so I think that the error band around the 1.6% inflation, about that's the pace it's running is probably pretty tight. Surely there will be supervisions, but I think the numbers are about right, and I usually, Margaret, don't like to go to year over year when we're talking about what's going on with inflation, because that includes a lot of high inflation Biden months in the back, and fewer and fewer as we get further into the year. But I think that the trajectory right now is best seen by the three month moving average, and that's below two, below the Fed target. So it means the Fed, as Austan Goolsbee said, has plenty of room to cut rates.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the President said inflation has stopped. You'd acknowledge that's an exaggeration.",
      "HASSETT: Well, I guess the inflation being above the target has stopped, for sure, and so, but inflation is not zero Also, that's fair.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, he did not give those caveats. He just said inflation has stopped. But Kevin, Kevin Hassett, stay with us. I've got to take a quick break, and I want to talk about the rest of what we've learned. On the other side of it. We've got more questions. Stay with us.",
      "PART 1 ENDS",
      "PART 2 STARTS",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face The Nation, and we continue our conversation now with the Director of the White House National Economic Council Kevin Hassett. This past week, we saw the President announce further changes to immigration policy. He halted diversity visas. There are now 39 countries on this travel ban or restricted list. This is in addition to all the deportations and revocations of asylum. The business community has made clear that the constant changes make it hard for them to plan, particularly in the small business category. They're concerned about a labor shortage and we've seen the U.S. workforce lose more than 1 million foreign-born workers in the past year. Are you hearing those concerns from the business community?",
      "HASSETT: Actually, it's the opposite. So in the sense that native-born workers are up more than 2 million. And so what we've seen is that as foreign-born workers, and a lot of them, don't forget, were illegal immigrants that have been deported, that when foreign-born workers depart, then it creates jobs for people who are native-born. The interesting thing too, which I'd like to remind everybody, is that native-born Americans aren't necessarily racially distinct at all.\u00a0 And so the majority of the native-born jobs that have been created over the last year are Hispanic Americans. It's, you know, just basically taking folks that are legally in the country and getting the jobs to them is what we see in the data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well the Associated General Contractors of America didn't say they're replacing those workers easily. They're saying they're having a hard time doing that, and issued a statement saying it's a significant challenge, urging the administration to look at ways to expand the construction workforce and allow more people to lawfully enter the country.",
      "HASSETT: Right. Well, one of the things we're seeing, this is exactly how markets work. Right? So construction workers, their salaries this year have gone up by $3,300 on average, according to the latest report --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Because the scarcity?",
      "HASSETT: Well, but when the price goes up, then people say, oh, I should go and I used to be a construction worker, but now I'm doing something else. I should go back to construction work because the salaries are so high. And so we're seeing a lot of that go on. And so we're very bullish on construction, and really happy to see that wages are going way back up. And so instead of having, you know, basically illegal people come in and take jobs away from native-born Americans at low wages, we're seeing people reenter the labor force at high wages.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to be clear from the business community part of the question is\u00a0 what is legal? Because you're changing the definition and pulling back asylum from some groups. So there's confusion at the constant change in policy. Will there be clarity in the new year?",
      "HASSETT: Oh, there will definitely be clarity in the new year. And I think there's clarity now that what we've done is that we've made it so that people are legally residents of the country and legally allowed to work, that they're, you know, basically top of the list when you're looking for somebody to hire.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you a bit about tariffs. Since as far back as July, we have heard the president refer to this idea of $2,000 checks being given out to households. The Treasury secretary said this would go to households making less than $100,000. Should Americans plan to receive those checks in 2026?",
      "HASSETT: That's going to depend on what happens with Congress. Congress is going to have to send those money to those peoples. But the thing we can say is that since July, we've had a lot of positive news about the economy. We've had a couple of quarters of almost 4% growth. We've got a big government surplus actually running for a few months in a row. The deficit relative to last year, is down by $600 billion and so in the summer, I wasn't so sure that there was space for a check like that, but now I'm pretty sure that there is, and so I would expect that in the new year, the President will bring forth a proposal to Congress to make that happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So a new proposal for these, it's not necessarily coming from existing tariff revenue?",
      "HASSETT: Well, it could come from from tariff revenue, but in the end, you know, we get taxes, we get tariffs, we get revenue from lots of places, and then Congress decides how to spend those monies. That's an appropriation. And so this would have to be money that would be an appropriation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So don't bank on it, in other words. So are you projecting that in the new year certain tariffs will remain in place, or do you see some of them going away?",
      "HASSETT: I think that most of the tariffs that we've passed this year have proven their mettle. We've got still high growth, which people said we couldn't if we had tariffs. We have reduction in the deficit. Reduction in the trade deficit. Imports from China are the lowest they've been since China entered the WTO. So there's a lot of success to crow about in the tariff space. But there are also things that we're hearing when we talk to people like trading partners and companies that trade a lot in the U.S.. There are also things that maybe could be adjusted. You saw that we decided to exempt coffee, for example, because we don't make a lot of coffee in the U.S.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --And coffee prices are up.",
      "HASSETT: And I think that if there's something that's not made in the U.S. at all, that there's an appetite, and Jamieson Greer is leading the effort to study these matters, that there's an appetite to exempt things if they're really not meant to be made in the U.S. because of, you know, like climate or things like that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've also go got the Supreme Court decision pending in terms of the specific IEEPA, as they're called, these are tariffs where the justification was citing fentanyl, Canadian crude, some Chinese imports. If the Supreme Court doesn't find in your favor, who gets the refund? Is it the companies, or is it the consumers? How does that work?",
      "HASSETT: Yeah, we really expect the Supreme Court is going to find with us, and I also think that if they didn't find with us, that it's going to be pretty unlikely that they're going to call for widespread refunds, because it would be an administrative problem to get those refunds out to there. But basically, whoever paid the tariff, like, actually cut the check to buy the thing, would be the person who would be getting the refund, if there were one.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Doesn't the administration claim it was the country that paid that? You're saying the company.",
      "HASSETT: It would be- like, I'm not talking about the incidence, right? That like, so the incidence of the tariff. So in the end, who pays the tariff depends on elasticities of supply and demand, and we know that China cut the price a lot, so that the post tariff price from Chinese goods is about what it was before the tariff. But the people who pay the tariff, if there is a refund, the people who actually paid for the good, the importer, in most cases, they're the ones who would be the first line of defense for refunding the tariff. But I really, really don't think that's going to happen, it'd be very complicated. And then that person would be responsible for allocating the tariff refund to the appropriate folks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That sounds like a mess.",
      "HASSETT: Yes, it is a mess, and that's why I think the Supreme Court wouldn't do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll wait and see. I want to quickly ask you about the oil market. I asked you last Sunday about that decision to seize a tanker off the coast of Venezuela. We saw yet another one over the weekend. You said last Sunday, it probably won't affect oil prices to be taking this oil off the black market. Do you stand by that? And was all that oil going to China?",
      "HASSETT: Yeah, you know, I haven't been briefed on the latest. I did see that this is another ship that was basically operating in the black market. And so there have been a little bit, there's been a little bit of black market activity in the oil sector to go to sanctioned countries and to get them some oil. And they're getting that oil in order to avoid the reforms that we think would make countries a better place. And so it's not a lot of oil compared to world supply. And so I don't think that people need to be worried here in the U.S. that the prices are going to go up because of these seizures of these ships. There's just a couple of them, and they were black market ships.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Were these sanctioned ships going to China?",
      "HASSETT: I'm not sure where they were going.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Kevin Hassett, thank you for your time--",
      "HASSETT: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have a great holiday. We'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Paul S. Coakley, President of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and Oklahoma City Archbishop, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Dec. 21, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Father, I want to ask you about this role you have at the head of the conference of bishops. Last month, there was this urgent message. It was a very rare statement addressing concern for the evolving situation impacting migrants, and the language was pretty sharp in it. Quote, \"We oppose the indiscriminate mass deportation of people. We pray for an end to dehumanizing rhetoric and violence, whether directed at immigrants or at law enforcement.\" What are bishops that you talk to seeing in parishes all around the country? What triggered this?",
      "ARCHBISHOP PAUL COAKLEY: I think it varies from place to place, for sure. So in communities with a more dense migrant population, there is a great deal of fear and uncertainty, anxiety because of the level of rhetoric that is- that is often employed when addressing issues around migration and the threats of deportation. So there's a lot of anxiety, so our pastors are trying to accompany people, walk with people, reassure people, and that's the message of the Church. And that was the reason for our special message in November, that we're with you. We hear you, we're aware of your suffering or your fears, and we fully intend to accompany you during this difficult time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I know there have been bishops in places like Charlotte, in parts of California, who have formally granted permission, or dispensation is the word used, for people to skip Sunday mass if they're afraid they could be targeted by ICE. Are you actually seeing a decline in the number of people attending mass because they're afraid they'll be arrested?",
      "ARCHBISHOP PAUL COAKLEY: We're not seeing that here in in Oklahoma. And I haven't heard it reported widely from my brother bishops. So I know that that is the case in some, some places, but I don't think it's as common, at least here locally or in places that I have personal contact with. There's a- there's an anxiety, there's a fear, but I don't think it's kept people away in great numbers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, this video that you released really got a lot of attention. It certainly got ours, and it mentioned being troubled by threats against the sanctity of houses of worship as well as hospitals and schools. You know, I spoke to the Vice President JD Vance last year and asked him about this change in policy that would allow for ICE to enter churches and schools. And he really pushed back hard. He says that the Catholic Church receives funds to help resettle immigrants. Thus they are motivated by financial and not humanitarian reasons. Have you had any kind of conversation with the Trump administration, with the Vice President to explain what it is you're trying to say?",
      "ARCHBISHOP PAUL COAKLEY: I have not had any personal conversations at this point with either the president or the vice president, so I look forward to engaging with them over matters of mutual concern, and certainly, undoubtedly the question of immigration is going to come up. I think we have opportunities to work together. We have opportunities to speak frankly with one another, so I will look forward to that in the near future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well the Vice President calls himself a devout Catholic, which is also why I ask. I mean, do you- what do you say to Catholics like him who argue that these hard line immigration policies have had a result that they sought, that the end justifies the means.",
      "ARCHBISHOP PAUL COAKLEY: I don't think we can ever say that the end justifies the means. We have to treat everyone with respect, respect of the human dignity, dignity of every person. There is no conflict necessarily between advocating for safe and secure borders and treating people with respect and dignity. We always have to treat people with, with dignity, God-given dignity. The state doesn't award it, and the state can't take it away. So it's, it's from the Creator. So I think as Christians, as believers, we- that's kind of a foundational bedrock thing for us, that people are to be respected and treated with dignity, whether they are documented or undocumented, whether they are here legally or illegally, they don't forfeit their human dignity.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what is it that you think is causing that to be an issue right now? Why do you think that there is a loss of dignity? Are there specific policies that you are thinking of when you say that?",
      "ARCHBISHOP PAUL COAKLEY: Well, not necessarily. I mean, I- just to treat people with respect, to afford them due process. The deportations that are, that are happening around the country can- it's instilling, as I said, fear in a rather widespread manner. So I think that's, that's something that concerns us all, that people have a- have a right to live in, in security and without fear of random and deportations. I think we're believers, of course, in due process. We have provisions in law that award due process to, to everyone. So that's what we are wanting to emphasize.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What would you advise others, other people of faith, to do for these immigrants?",
      "ARCHBISHOP PAUL COAKLEY: Well, we are a nation of immigrants ourselves. So I think that's something that we as Americans need to always come back to. We are founded upon the immigrant experience. So I think we need to be generous in welcoming immigrants. We certainly have a right and a duty to respect borders of our nation. And I would say, remind all of us that we have a right and a duty to respect sovereign borders of a state, but, but we also have a responsibility to welcome migrants. This is kind of a fundamental principle in, in Catholic social teaching regarding immigration and migration. People have a right to to remain in their homeland, but, but they also ought to be allowed to migrate when conditions in their homeland are unsafe and necessitate moving to a place where they can find peace and security.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Archbishop Paul Coakley of Oklahoma City, thank you for your time today.",
      "ARCHBISHOP COAKLEY: Thank you. Thank you very much.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: UNICEF warns that more than 200 million children will require humanitarian assistance in the coming year. The largest crisis right now is Sudan. Catherine Russell, UNICEF's Executive Director is just back from Sudan and South Sudan. Good morning to you.",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: Good morning, Margaret, how are you?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm well, but you are- we want to draw attention here to those in need. And I know Secretary of State Marco Rubio, just on Friday, called for a cessation of hostilities. He said the U.S. is pushing for humanitarian truce to allow some of these aid organizations to operate. But aid convoys have been struck on their way in, he also acknowledged. What kind of challenges are you facing?",
      "RUSSELL: Well, Sudan is, at this moment, the largest humanitarian crisis we're facing. And there are many things happening there. One is that children, in particular, but people are on the move. Millions of people are moving around the country. We have hunger, extreme hunger, including famine designated in certain parts of the country. We're also seeing just horrific levels of violence- excuse me, including rape, including against children. UNICEF did a report about that about a year ago, even children under the age of one. Absolutely terrible stories. And a woman I met in Chad who had fled Darfur told me about the effort to sort of rape women in front of their families and their communities, really trying to terrorize them and videotaping it to humiliate them. And so the levels of violence are horrific. We have children out of school. So the bottom line here is that the needs are enormous. The challenges are just absolutely staggering. And I think the world needs to come together. You know, in the short term, for sure, we need better humanitarian access. We need to reach all of these communities, \u00a0that's hard to do right now. But the truth is Margaret that what I heard from children across Sudan was the same thing, which is, I would say to them, you know, what do you think about? What do you want? And they all said the same thing, which is, we want peace. I think they understand that the only answer here, really, is to solve the political problems so that people can get back to some sort of a decent life.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I just, I don't want to let go what you just mentioned, in terms of why something like that would be done to children and to women in front of their families. The term genocide is used in Sudan. What you are describing there in terms of treatment of gender based violence, it sounds like you are saying that is an attempt to destroy a society by carrying out rape.",
      "RUSSELL: I mean, there are definitely atrocities that are intended to terrorize communities, to force them to move, to scare them. And you know, they're effective strategies for sure. And I think you know the world needs to take a look. I mean, Sudan, I know it seems so far away, and it is in many ways, but it is also a place where children are suffering so enormously. And I think especially, you know, now we're in the holiday season, you know, you want to think about, you know, people being with their families all the rest of it. I mean, children in so many places are not- are not having those sort of luxuries. They are really suffering. And I think the world needs to pay attention to that. And I commend, you know, Senator Rubio- Secretary Rubio, now for pointing this out, because I think the key thing here is that we need attention to the problem.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the U.S. has historically been the largest donor to UNICEF, but we've seen tremendous cuts by this administration, including a $142 million claw back of congressionally approved funds. Secretary Rubio said no one died from these aid cuts, and on Friday, he said he's very proud of the changes that were made in foreign aid. Tell us what the reality is of the funding cuts.",
      "RUSSELL: The funding cuts are challenging. And I think the issue to understand is it's not just the United States. It's almost every donor to- certainly to UNICEF, but to the UN system broadly, and to the humanitarian sector. And so when you add all of those together, the impacts are really dramatic, because it means that you know what- what financial support we do get, we have to spread now over- over more places, and with less support from- from donor countries. So I think you know there are, certainly, you know, there have been and will probably always be catastrophes that we're trying to deal with, and children are suffering. The United States has always proudly led, I think, on humanitarian response and on helping children. And, you know, we're hopeful that some of the money that has been taken back will be restored to us. We continue to work with the State Department. There are efforts to fund a lot of the humanitarian and sort of life saving work that we do. But really, you know, the needs around the world are just absolutely enormous, and it's the United States and other donors who have to come in behind that, along with the private sector, I have to add that that is also important.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I should point out that the U.S. is one of the largest foreign aid donors to South Sudan, but that foreign aid is also under threat at this moment because of the government not complying with what the U.S. is demanding. Let me quickly--",
      "RUSSELL: --South Sudan is a challenge. I was just there too, and that is, you know, the government there needs to do a better job",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Quickly before I let you go. Gaza, how are things improving?",
      "RUSSELL: Well, again, I would say, thanks to the ceasefire and the administration here was critical on doing that, things have gotten a bit better. We are able to move around better. But, you know, there's tremendous misery. The challenges remain. We have a lot of work that needs to get done. I mean, you've seen all of the images, the destruction. You know, we still have serious level- levels of malnutrition. We are trying to get shelter in place. You know, there's rain and just misery for children all around. So I think, you know, I would say there definitely is progress with the ceasefire. God willing that holds, and then we can continue to get more and more aid in there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: God willing that holds, as you say. Catherine Russell, thank you for your time today. We'll be back in a moment.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Reps. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Dec. 21, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We are joined now by two House members who pushed their colleagues into passing the bill to release these documents. Republican Thomas Massie, who is in Garrison, Kentucky, and Democrat Ro Khanna, who joins us this morning from Palo Alto, California. It's good to have both of you here. I want to start with you, Congressman Massie, because in these past 48 hours, we have seen the Justice Department acknowledge it's an incomplete release, but they have put out more than 13,000 files. They say more will come. This isn't everything you asked for just yet, but would you acknowledge that they are complying with this spirit, if not the intent of your law?",
      "REP. THOMAS MASSIE: No, they're flouting the spirit and the letter of the law. It's very troubling the posture that they've taken. And I won't be satisfied until the survivors are satisfied. You know, I said in the hours leading up to this release that we will know if they are complying, if they implicate any of the other criminals that are involved and the suspects that are involved. The witnesses this- the victims themselves, have given to the FBI, and they've never been mentioned.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there are some disclosures in here that seem new. Congressman Khanna. The documents confirm that the FBI received a complaint about Jeffrey Epstein back in 1996 but the woman, whose name is Maria Farmer who made that complaint, said federal officials failed to follow up. She said the disclosure makes her feel redeemed, and that this was one of the best days of her life to see these documents made public. What action do you want taken around a case like this?",
      "REP. RO KHANNA: That was the single most important disclosure of what we got. I know Maria's sister. She sounded the alarm in 1996, she complained to the FBI. The problem is that Epstein was so connected with law enforcement and powerful politicians, the FBI did nothing for a decade. Frankly, she deserves compensation. She deserves an explanation, but the broader point is, Blanche was on this morning saying that Massie and I have a problem, that it's taking too long. That's not the problem. The problem is, this was a slap in the face of survivors. What do they want? They want to know who are the rich and powerful men who visited Epstein's rape island and covered up the abuse and the key documents that our law basically said needed to be released. The 60-count indictment that actually implicates a lot of these people and the prosecution memo were not released. It's not about the timeline, it's about the selective concealment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, yet. Right? The Deputy Attorney General said there are more disclosures that will be made. You believe that they will not release that particular part? You did give them some leeway for redactions.",
      "REP. KHANNA: Well, first of all, the redactions were excessive. And even Harvard Law professors who have looked at that have said, you can't redact internal communications, you can't redact workforce product, and the courts are going to find that these were excessive. But my point, and I'm sure Congressman Massie can elaborate, is that we want the files out. So if our sounding the alarm on what is missing is going to help them get those files out, fine. But this shouldn't be a big document dump. There's a pretty simple point, who raped these young girls who covered it up, and why are they getting away with it?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're saying specific things regarding the indictment. Congressman Massie, I saw in a video that you posted, you had a very specific benchmark of success here. You said, you know there are at least 20 men accused of sex crimes known to the FBI. How do you know that number? And do you know those names?",
      "REP. MASSIE: Yeah, the survivors' lawyers have told me those numbers, and they've described their professions and in general, but they've only given me one of those names, and I mentioned that in a congressional hearing, Jess Staley. So I searched these documents, I didn't see Jess Staley's name, nor did I see 19 other names. And here's why we shouldn't be optimistic that Blanche or Bondi are going to release these things. They sent a six page memo to Congress and said- they cited pre-existing laws as reasons that they weren't going to follow our law. For instance, our law requires them to release information regardless of embarrassment, but they are trying to say that a previous law prevails when it doesn't. Common sense says it doesn't, the Privacy Act doesn't protect them from that. And then also, as Ro said, internal communications those they're using a FOIA standard that doesn't apply because our law already says they have to give us internal communications",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of the gentleman there you referenced as accused. I mean being in the document doesn't necessarily prove criminal behavior right? In terms of the redactions, what the Deputy Attorney General said is that they were abiding by your law, and also a judge in New York had ordered them to listen to victims. So they're claiming that information that they had initially even published Friday they had to pull down because they were trying to protect victims. You aren't- you don't sound convinced that they are abiding by, you know, this intent?",
      "REP. MASSIE: No, they are not abiding. And all three judges who released the grand jury material said that our law trumps the prior law. That's just common sense. Law school 101. Yet Todd Blanche is using a different theory that wouldn't survive first contact with any court, which is he's trying to say that prior laws override our law. That's not the way this works.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN : Okay, what are you going to do about it, to force them to comply? I mean, can you do anything?",
      "REP. MASSIE: Oh, absolutely. Look, people have talked about- and by the way, Todd Blanche is the face of this, but it's really the Attorney General's Office, Pam Bondi, who is responsible. And there are several ways to get at this. Some take longer. Some are shorter. The quickest way, and I think most expeditious way, to get justice for these victims is to bring inherent contempt against Pam Bondi, and that doesn't require going through the courts and give her and, and- basically Ro Khanna and I are talking about and drafting that right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, well, I mean, on another network this morning, Democratic Senator Tim Kaine said, impeachment or contempt, it is premature, Congressman Khanna. And the Deputy Attorney General said, \"bring it on.\" They don't seem to be taking this very seriously. And if you just don't have the math in the Senate, including, at least now this Democratic senator not being convinced, doesn't that sort of show that you're at the limit of pressure?",
      "REP. KHANNA: No, we only need the House for inherent contempt, and we're building a bipartisan coalition, and it would fine Pam Bondi for every day that she's not releasing these documents. I'll tell you why, I've talked to the survivors, why this is such a slap in the face. One of the survivors said they released her name accidentally, but they still have not released the FBI file about the people who abused her at her request. And the problem here is that there are rich and powerful people. We all know this. There are 1,200 victims. They're rich and powerful people who either engaged in this abuse, covered it up or were on this island. And what the American people want to know is, who are these people? And instead of holding them accountable, Pam Bondi is breaking the law. And this is the corrupt system, the Epstein class that people are sick of. So I believe we're going to get bipartisan support in holding her accountable, and a committee of Congress should determine whether these redactions are justified or not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sometime in January, when you all come back. I assume that- that will happen. I want to ask you though Congressman Khanna, there have been images released in the past 48 hours. Some of them include former President Bill Clinton. There's at least one image of Donald Trump. I should say neither man has been accused of any wrong doing related to Epstein, though they clearly knew him. But since Friday's publication, we're showing the image here now. One of the pictures was pulled down. There were 15 images total that were then redacted from the DOJ website. And it's-\u00a0 it's kind of hard to see, but it's an open drawer with a photo of President Trump. Why do you think that was pulled down? Because the Deputy Attorney General says this was victims saying that their privacy or somehow their integrity was being compromised by having that image published.",
      "REP. KHANNA: Well, I'm less concerned about that photo. I don't know the facts. My concern is the major documents that we know are out there that haven't been released, the 60-count indictment that shows massive financial fraud and foreign interference, the prosecution memo and look--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Foreign interference?--",
      "REP. KHANNA: --They put out these Bill Clinton pictures- Well, they- there are allegations that there are foreign governments that potentially were involved. And that all needs to come out. And it needs to come out in the indictments, it needs to come out in the prosecution memos. But the reality is, they put out these pictures for Bill Clinton. Fine, put it all out. But don't distract from the fundamental issue, which is, who are these powerful people who were visited rape- the rape island? I mean, they're 1200 victims. It defies common sense that it was just Epstein and- and Maxwell, and they're hiding something. And you know why the American people are so upset? My X account had MAGA supporters supporting me for the first time, saying, you know, Pam Bondi whiffed, according to Susan Wiles, she is breaking the law. She needs to be held accountable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're referring to the Vanity Fair quote that the chief of staff gave, saying the \"whiffed,\" and she said that Pam Bondi gave them \"binders full of nothingness.\" And then when it came to the client list, she said it was on her desk. \"There is no client list,\" quote \"and it sure as hell wasn't on her desk.\" Do you see that as an acknowledgement here, though, that, that the politics have overtaken the substance?",
      "REP. KHANNA: No, for us, it's about the survivors. And if you look at Thomas Massie and my comments, the morning of the release, we were giving t- Blanche the benefit of the doubt. We said, if it's not all there, fine, just get the information out. It's when the survivors said that this is an insult, this is a slap in their face that we aren't getting the truth about who these men were on the - on rape island, that we started sounding the alarm. And this is more documents of nothingness. And I guess the question the American people have even to me, is, is the system so corrupt, is the system so corrupt that Thomas Massie and you defy the odds, pass a bill through a discharge petition, get the Senate, get the president to sign it, and still, these rich and powerful people are being protected. Who has this kind of hold on our government? What are they hiding? Why are they not releasing this?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you want what people involved in those initial investigations down in Florida, re-examined and possibly prosecuted?",
      "REP. KHANNA: I want the information out which was in that prosecution memo that Acosta disregarded, that were in those indictments, that there were 60 counts against Epstein, only two counts were prosecuted. I want to know who were these other people who were on the Epstein's rape island, who were the people who saw young girls being paraded around at parties, 13,14,15 year olds, and didn't say anything. And why- why is it so hard when there's a law requiring these names to come out? What we're seeing is survivors' names come out, but not the men who abuse them. And instead of, instead of holding elites accountable, Pam Bondi is breaking the law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will see when you gentlemen come back to work sometime in January, what your next measures are. It sounds like you've made it clear you're moving action against the Attorney General. Thank you both for your reaction today, Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",

      "Israel's Cabinet approved a proposal for 19 new settlements in the occupied West Bank, the far-right finance minister said on Sunday.",
      "The settlements include two that were previously evacuated during a 2005 disengagement plan, according to Finance Minister Betzalel Smotrich, who has pushed a settlement expansion agenda in the West Bank.",
      "It brings the total number of new settlements over the past two years to 69, Smotrich wrote on X.",
      "The approval increases the number of settlements in the West Bank by nearly 50% during the current government's tenure, from 141 in 2022 to 210 after the current approval, according to Peace Now, an anti-settlement watchdog group. Settlements are widely considered illegal under international law.",
      "The approval comes as the U.S. is pushing Israel and Hamas to move ahead with the new phase of the Gaza ceasefire, which took effect Oct. 10. The U.S.-brokered plan calls for a possible \"pathway\" to a Palestinian state \u2014 something Smotrich says the settlements are aimed at preventing.",
      "The Cabinet decision included a retroactive legalization of some previously established settlement outposts or neighborhoods of existing settlements, and the creation of settlements on land where Palestinians were evacuated, Peace Now said.",
      "Israel captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza \u2014 areas claimed by the Palestinians for a future state \u2014 in the 1967 war. It has settled more than 500,000 Jews in the West Bank, in addition to over 200,000 more in contested east Jerusalem. About 15% of settlers are Americans.",
      "The United Nations calls the settlements, which are scattered inside the West Bank and East Jerusalem, illegal.",
      "Israel's government is dominated by far-right proponents of the settler movement, including Smotrich and Cabinet Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who oversees the nation's police force.",
      "According to the U.N., settler expansion has been compounded by a surge of attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank in recent months.",
      "During October's olive harvest, settlers across the territory launched an average of eight attacks daily, according to the United Nations humanitarian office, the most since it began collecting data in 2006. The attacks, the U.N. reported, continued in November, with the agency recording at least 136 more by Nov. 24.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to \"Face the Nation.\" We're joined now by the Director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett. Good to have you back.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT, DIRECTOR NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: It's great to be back.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So people are holiday shopping. They're aware of prices. The president said this week prices are coming down tremendously. The latest data, though, from the Consumer Price Index is up 3% year over year, personal consumption index is up 2.8% year over year. What data is he looking at? What's your benchmark?",
      "HASSETT: Right. Well, one of the things that if you saw his presentation in Pennsylvania, as he put up a bunch of charts, which he loves to do, where he went through the individual items that we've already sort of made a bunch of progress on. And so, for example, under Joe Biden, prescription drugs were up 9%. So far this year, they're down six tenths of a percent. Gasoline is way down. It was like the highest ever under Biden--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Eggs, he was talking about eggs, yeah.",
      "HASSETT: Yeah, he was talking about eggs. And so I think the way to think about inflation, of course, is that there are like micro effects, like the time that we had the avian flu affecting drug prices. And then macro effects, which is runaway spending, big deficits and then an accommodative Fed policy. And I think--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But now tariffs adding to some price increases according to the Fed chair.",
      "HASSETT: Well, I- you know, I think that the tariff evidence is mixed. But the point is that we've got deficit going way, way down. So right now, it's looking like the deficit for this year will be $600 billion lower than it was last year. That really helps lower inflation. We've got the trade deficit cut in half from last year. And so all of these things are things that should continue to move us towards the Fed target of 2%.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Companies aren't necessarily going to bring items down, though, in terms of pricing, right? I mean, the- the president told the Wall Street Journal he didn't know when all of this money, quote, \"is going to kick in.\" I think he was talking to business investment and tariffs, and help voters, \"all I can do is do my job.\" When do you anticipate voters will feel this positive impact?",
      "HASSETT: Right. Well, it's definitely the case that, and you guys have been covered a lot, that consumer sentiment right now is lower than anyone would like. But, you know, we find that that very often happens during a government shutdown when everybody's really upset--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the last administration called that the \"vibecession,\" right?",
      "HASSETT: No, but--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --the data is good, but people feel bad.",
      "HASSETT: --Yeah, but what's going to happen is--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Same thing, you're saying.",
      "HASSETT: No what's- I'm not saying that. What- what I'm saying is that people are going to see the high growth. Growth is 4%. Income growth is up about $1,200 this year. People look at their wallets and see they're doing better, which is why we had the biggest Black Friday ever and so on and so--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's more higher income se--",
      "HASSETT: --The sentiment will catch up with the reality. Under Joe Biden, the fact is that real purchasing power dropped by about $3,000. So far this year, it's up by about $1,200 per family. And the money that we're talking about is like real money. So for groceries, it went from $400 a month to $525 a month under Biden. So that's like an extra more than $1,000 a year. You have to spend on groceries. It's down this year for us, for the grocery package, but it's still got a lot of room to grow- to go.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A lot more to go--",
      "HASSETT: Yeah.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the president reduced some tariffs on some of those grocery items--",
      "HASSETT: --On the food stuff--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --with an eye towards that.",
      "HASSETT: Yeah, if we don't make it here, then pretty much we don't tariff it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you, you mentioned gas. Oil prices globally are relatively low. We saw this Coast Guard interdiction with military forces boarding and seizing this vessel off the coast of Venezuela. Do you feel you have the leeway there, pricing-wise, to conduct more seizures or even a blockade of oil from Venezuela, without it hurting?",
      "HASSETT: Well, I'm not a foreign policy guy, so what we do with Venezuela and whether we blockade is up to the president and Marco Rubio. But I could say that--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But you've got the leeway, right--",
      "HASSETT: --that- that what's been going on is there's been kind of a black market for oil amongst sort of this sanctioned countries. And what we're doing is we're shutting that black market down. Whether that affects prices outside of the sanctioned countries is kind of an open question. Probably not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think it will?",
      "HASSETT: No, because they're already kind of on the ropes, these countries. They're only getting oil when they get like sort of black fleets to sneak in and give them the oil. And that's what we're trying to slow down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, I want to ask you about the Fed decision. The Federal Open Market Committee said job gains have slowed this year. We also saw the survey from the Business Roundtable. I'm sure you saw it. They asked CEOs what they expect to happen, and they anticipate employment will decrease in 2026 rather than increase. Are you concerned about a hiring slowdown?",
      "HASSETT: The same Fed said that they were more bullish on growth for next year, right? And so I think that we're at a certain--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But on the jobs picture.",
      "HASSETT: But on the jobs picture, you know, we're going to get the data next week. And so maybe next Sunday I'll come back and we'll talk about it, because we've got two months of data coming out on Tuesday. And we'll get a clearer picture because right now we just have some very difficult to pin down surveys like the gold standard for this will be really the household survey, which we don't even get for October.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But these are CEOs. They're the people who would be doing the hiring, right? And they're saying, we're not doing it.",
      "HASSETT: But, but they don't have the broad perspective that we'll get when we get the big data released next week.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you trust that big data?",
      "HASSETT: I trust the household survey, especially. And sadly, we won't have one for October. But we're going to get one for November. And that's going to be really important for thinking about where the job market is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Employment is one of the things that the Fed watches closely. And we heard again from the president that you were on this short list to be potentially the next Fed chair, although he was conducting interviews this week. He said you and Hoover's Kevin Warsh are at the top of the list. On Friday, the president was asked how big of a role he wants to personally play in future Fed interest rate decisions. Take a listen.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE BEGINS]",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think I certainly should have a role in talking to whoever the head of the Fed is, or the Fed. I don't think- you know the old days that used to happen. Nowadays, it's sort of, they think it shouldn't happen. But I've done great. I've made a lot of money, I'm very successful. I think my voice should be heard.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 As Fed chair, how frequently would you consult with the president when he says he wants his voice heard?",
      "HASSETT: Well, I'm right now the top economic advisor for the president, and I talk about almost everything with him almost every day. I've certainly talked about monetary policy. I think he has very strong and well-founded views about what we ought to do. But in the end, the job of the Fed is to be independent and to work with the group of people that are on the Board of Governors, at the FOMC, to drive a group consensus on where interest rates should be and to do so, you know, basically with the guidance of the Fed chair. But in the end, it's a committee that votes. And I'd be happy to talk to the president every day, you know, until both of us are dead because it's so much fun to talk--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even if you were Fed Chair.",

      "HASSETT: Excuse me?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Would the president's voice have equal weighting to the voting members?",
      "HASSETT: No, no, he would have no weight. It's just his opinion matters if it's good, you know, if it's based on data. And then if you go to the committee and you say, well, the president made this argument and that's a really sound argument, I think, what do you think? If they reject it, then they'll vote in a different way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. Well, we'll be watching to see what happens. Kevin Hassett.",

      "The discussions are part of the Trump administration's monthslong push for peace that also included meetings with Ukrainian and European officials in Berlin earlier this week. Ukraine's chief negotiator said late Friday that his delegation had completed separate meetings in the U.S. with American and European partners.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said much will depend on the U.S. posture after discussions with the Russians.",
      "Speaking at a news conference in Kyiv with Portuguese Prime Minister Lu\u00eds Montenegro, Zelenskyy said that \"the key question remains how the United States responds after consultations with the Russians. At this point, I honestly don't know, but I will know later today.\"",
      "Ukraine and Portugal signed an agreement to establish joint production of maritime drones, Zelenskyy said. \"This is one of the most promising areas of defense cooperation. What matters now is delivering results, and all parts of Europe must have sufficient capabilities to counter any threats,\" he said.",
      "Ukraine targets a Russian oil rig and a patrol ship",
      "Some of those wounded in Odesa were on a bus at the center of the strike late Friday, the emergency service said in a Telegram post. Trucks caught fire in the parking lot and cars were also damaged.",
      "The port was struck with ballistic missiles, said Oleh Kiper, the head of the Odesa region.",
      "Moscow did not immediately acknowledge reports of the attack. The Russian Defense Ministry said Saturday that over the previous day, it had struck unspecified \"transport and storage infrastructure used by the Ukrainian armed forces,\" along with energy facilities and those supplying Kyiv's war effort.",
      "Elsewhere, Ukrainian drones hit a Russian oil rig, the military patrol ship Okhotnik and other facilities, Ukraine's General Staff said in a statement Saturday. It said the ship was patrolling in the Caspian Sea near an oil and gas production platform. The extent of the damage was still being clarified, it said.",
      "The drilling platform at the Filanovsky oil and gas field as also hit. The facility is operated by Russian oil giant Lukoil. Ukrainian drones also struck a radar system in the Krasnosilske area of Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed from Ukraine in 2014.",
      "There was no immediate comment from the Russian government or Lukoil. The company is one of two Russian oil majors \u2014 alongside state-owned Gazprom \u2014\u00a0recent U.S. sanctions\u00a0that aim to deprive Moscow of oil export revenue that helps it sustain the war.",

      "U.S. President Donald Trump has unleashed an extensive diplomatic push to end the war, but his efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands by Moscow and Kyiv.",

      "On Friday, Putin voiced confidence that the Kremlin would achieve its goals militarily if Kyiv doesn't agree to Russia's conditions in peace talks.",
      "European Union leaders on Friday agreed to provide $106 billion to Ukraine to meet its military and economic needs for the next two years, although they failed to bridge differences with Belgium that would have allowed them to use frozen Russian assets to raise the funds. Instead, they were borrowed on capital markets.",
      "After almost four years of war, the International Monetary Fund estimates that Ukraine will need $161 billion in 2026 and 2027. The government in Kyiv is on the verge of bankruptcy, and desperately needs the money by spring.",

    "published": "Sat, 20 Dec 2025 11:16:00 -0500",
    "summary": "To what does LEGO owe its remarkable half-century success story? CBS News visits the toy giant's Denmark headquarters to find out.",
    "story": [
      "Billund, Denmark - Millions of people around the world instantly recognize the look, the feel \u2014 especially under foot \u2014 and even the sound of LEGO. The plastic blocks have shaped childhood memories for generations.",
      "At the company's home in Denmark, decades of those experiences are captured inside a secret museum that only LEGO employees can access. CBS News, however, got a rare look inside that little-known museum, where it was possible to trace the evolution of one of the world's most recognizable and beloved toys.",
      "The museum sits next to the original home of LEGO's founder, Ole Kirk Kristiansen \u2014 a reminder of the toy giant's humble beginnings. The brand's name reflects its philosophy: \"LEGO\" comes from the Danish phrase \"leg godt,\" or \"play well.\"",
      "Inside the museum are some of the very first LEGO bricks, including pieces that date back to the 1950s. Among the earliest creations housed there is the first LEGO \"system\" that was ever assembled \u2014 a small town that laid the foundation for everything the company would go on to build.",
      "That system \u2014 the idea that every LEGO brick, regardless of when it was made, can connect \u2014 dates back to 1955, when the company assembled that first play town. Over the decades, LEGO creations have evolved from medieval villages to mind-blowing architectural feats.",
      "The collection features vintage sets that continue functioning as they were designed to, many decades later, including a working drawbridge castle from the 1970s. But there's been no shortage of evolution, either. From the early designs, LEGO's builds have grown increasingly ambitious and sophisticated.",
      "Along with the classics, the museum showcases intricate creations ranging from miniatures of iconic landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower to LEGO flower bouquets. Other pieces have evolved from LEGO's own sub-brands. Many of today's parents will be familiar, for instance, with armies of tiny characters from the modern kids' TV fantasy superhero show Ninjago.",
      "Inside Lego House",
      "CBS News also got a glimpse inside LEGO House, a nearly 130,000-square-foot monument to the toy, filled with some 25 million LEGO bricks, including those of the 6 million-plus that make up the striking \"Tree of Creativity.\"",
      "Standing nearly 50 feet high, it's the largest known LEGO build in the world. Each branch is packed with detail, a feast for the eyes.",
      "Behind all the creations is LEGO's own in-house army of creatives.",
      "\"There are about 700 designers here,\" Andr\u00e9 Doxey, the LEGO Group's first American Head of Design, told CBS News.",
      "Doxey said creativity, not technical skill, has been key to LEGO's enduring appeal.",
      "\"You don't have to be a designer,\" he said. \"You just have to be brave, creative and curious, and give it a try.\"",
      "Doxey believes LEGO's remarkable enduring popularity is owed largely to the freedom it offers.",
      "\"We know people love to create, kids love to create,\" he said. \"Our system is a creative medium. It enables them to imagine anything they want to imagine.\"",
      "LEGO: Not just for the kids \u2014 but mainly for the kids",
      "And LEGO has found that the appeal extends well beyond childhood. Nostalgia plays a powerful role at the company, and so-called AFOLs \u2014 Adult Fans of LEGO \u2014 represent a significant and growing market.",
      "But Design Master Milan Madge knows the audience well, and while not denying the rising popularity of more complex, grown-up builds, he said children remain the company's priority.",
      "\"They're our first inspiration,\" he said. \"We try to act like children and see the world through their eyes.\"",
      "While modern designs are often created digitally to streamline production, Madge said he still prefers working with physical bricks.",
      "\"There's a real connection between the mind and the creative process when you're doing hands-on work,\" he said.",
      "That simple tactile connection \u2014 brick by brick \u2014 has helped make LEGO the top-grossing toy company in the world. Families build together. Friends gather around shared creations. Communities form, united by the sound of bricks rattling in a box.",
      "\"Everyone knows that sound,\" Doxey told CBS News. \"You shake it, and you know exactly what it is.\"",
      "A beloved toy, with a plastic problem",
      "Beyond all the creativity and the nostalgia, however, the LEGO Group is also grappling with a fundamental issue in a world facing what a majority of scientists say is a climate crisis: The company's empire is still built almost entirely on plastic, and one of the key components in most plastic is fossil fuel.",
      "Every ton of LEGO produced requires about two tons of petrochemicals in the manufacturing process, according to the global sustainability information and data platform, illuminem. LEGO makes approximately 60 billion bricks per year, and based on illuminem's data, some of the company's largest sets would require the equivalent of over 60 pounds of petrochemical equivalent to produce.",
      "Despite ambitious climate pledges, the company has so far failed to find a sustainable path for its toys.",
      "LEGO abandoned a \"bottles to bricks\" initiative in 2023 after finding the proposed recyclable material it hoped to use would, in fact, increase emissions compared to its current materials.",
      "\"LEGO bricks are made for children, so they must meet extremely high quality and safety standards,\" the company told CBS News in a statement. \"They must also be durable, and are precision-engineered to accuracy of less than a hair's width so that a brick made today still fits one made 60 years ago.\"",
      "The company said it has tested more than 600 different materials for its LEGO bricks, including some derived from \"sustainable-sourced sugarcane\" and recycled materials from artificial marble kitchen countertops.",

    "summary": "TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance must sever ties with TikTok or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 TikTok has signed a deal to sell its U.S. operations to a consortium of American investors, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News.",
      "Axios was first to report the deal.",
      "Under a law passed last year, TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, must either sever ties with the social media platform's American operations or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services. The law set a January 2025 deadline, but President Trump has extended it several times, most recently until Jan. 23, 2026.",
      "In September, Mr. Trump signed an executive order paving the way for a deal brokered by his administration to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. under a new corporate structure with American investors.",
      "At the time, a senior White House official said that under the proposed deal, ByteDance's content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok will be copied and retrained to run solely on the data of its U.S. user base. Cloud-computing firm Oracle will provide \"top to bottom security\" by hosting Americans' user data and reviewing the app's code to ensure \"the algorithm is behaving appropriately and it's secure,\" the official said.",
      "The deal will establish a \"joint venture\" based in the U.S., with a majority of U.S. investors and owners and a majority of Americans on its board of directors, the White House said in September. Mr. Trump's executive order says ByteDance and its affiliates will own less than 20% of the new entity, keeping it below the limit on foreign ownership set by last year's divest-or-ban law.",
      "A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, are expected to have a stake in the new TikTok, the White House previously said. (Oracle was cofounded by Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "Axios reported Thursday that Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX will collectively own 45% of the U.S. entity. Almost one-third of the new entity will be owned by current ByteDance investors, according to Axios.",
      "When reached by CBS News Thursday, an Oracle spokesperson declined to comment on the deal.",
      "\"We feel 100% confident that this proposal, if it's completed, complies with the law,\" the senior White House official said in September, adding that the White House believes it \"complies with all the relevant laws and policies on both sides.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters that Chinese President Xi Jinping signed off on the deal during a call in September. \"He gave us the go-ahead,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "China's comments about what has been agreed to have been more vague.",
      "\"China's position on the TikTok issue is clear: The Chinese government respects\u2002the wishes of the company in question, and would be happy to see productive commercial negotiations in keeping with market rules lead to\u2002a solution that complies with China's laws and regulations and takes into account the interests of both sides. The U.S. side needs to\u2002provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese investors,\" the Chinese government's summary of the September call between Xi and Mr. Trump said.",
      "The sale-or-ban law, which was\u00a0upheld by the Supreme Court, took effect a day before Mr. Trump's inauguration last January. Mr. Trump, however, has issued\u00a0new orders\u00a0every few months directing the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failing to remove the widely popular app from their platforms.",
      "There's been little pushback from lawmakers, who for years raised concerns about TikTok's potential risks to national security if the Chinese government was able to access the vast amount of Americans' data collected by the app or carry out influence operations through it.",
      "But some are likely to see the deal as not going far enough when it comes to TikTok's algorithm. After the White House announced the deal in September, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the chairman of the House China committee, expressed concern.",
      "\"Transitioning to a majority American-owned entity would mark an important step in that process that could mitigate some of the ByteDance threat depending on the details, but divestment was not the law's only requirement,\" Moolenaar said in a statement. \"The law also set firm guardrails that prohibit cooperation between ByteDance and any prospective TikTok successor on the all-important recommendation algorithm, as well as preclude operational ties between the new entity and ByteDance.\"",

    "summary": "Temperatures in the Arctic continue to follow a long-term warming trend, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
    "story": [
      "The Arctic just experienced its hottest year since record-keeping began more than a century ago, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced Wednesday. Rising temperatures in the polar region show no signs of leveling off, either, according to the agency, which said they are rising twice as fast as overall global temperatures.",
      "NOAA reviewed how the Arctic is faring in a warming world in the latest iteration of its annual Arctic Report Card.",
      "\"To observe the Arctic is to take the pulse of the planet,\" reads the report's executive summary. \"The Arctic is warming several times faster than Earth as a whole, reshaping the northern landscapes, ecosystems, and livelihoods of Arctic peoples. Also transforming are the roles the Arctic plays in the global climate, economic, and societal systems.\"",
      "Since the previous year's report card, climate change has continued to impact the Earth's northernmost area even more than the rest of the planet, NOAA said. The latest report details some of the most concerning developments observed over the last year, with scientists noting \"a clear pattern of Arctic warming.\"",
      "During the observational period, from October 2024 to September 2025, average sea surface temperatures measured in the Arctic were higher than the 1991-2020 average by as much as 13 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the report. Those were the warmest sea surface temperatures observed in the Arctic since at least 1900, signaling an intensifying climate pattern for the region.",
      "In March, Arctic winter sea ice hit its lowest annual maximum extent in the 47 years of satellite data collection, and six months later, the ice reached its 10th lowest annual minimum. \"All of the 19 lowest September minimum ice extents have occurred in the last 19 years,\" the report noted.",
      "Air temperatures increased, too. The autumn season of 2024 was the warmest on record, and the winter of 2025 ranked as the second-warmest, the report card said. Scientists also determined that Arctic temperatures since 2006 have increased at more than double the rate of global temperature changes. They have been warning for years that climate change is heating up the northern polar region more dramatically than anywhere else.",
      "Vital ecosystems are being transformed as a result of the Arctic's persistent warmth, according to the report card. The heat is accelerating sea ice loss and glacier melt while transforming the region's landscapes. Its tundra, for example, has been turning green as thawed permafrost and longer summers give foliage more opportunities to grow.",
      "Scientists emphasize that what happens to the Arctic directly affects the rest of the world, especially as sea ice minimums have continued to drop. Glaciers in Scandinavia saw their largest annual loss of ice on record between 2023 and 2024, and the Greenland Ice Sheet lost an estimated 129 billion tons of ice in 2025, according to NOAA, continuing an ongoing trend.",
      "\"Ongoing glacier loss contributes to steadily rising global sea levels, threatening Arctic communities' water supplies, driving destructive floods and increasing landslide and tsunami hazards that endanger people, infrastructure, and coastline,\" NOAA's report said.",

      "\"This set of dinosaur footprints is one of the largest collections in all of Europe, in the whole world,\" Attilio Fontana, head of the Lombardy region in northern Italy, said during a news conference.",
      "The tracks, which are over 200 million years old, were discovered in the Stelvio National Park, in an area between the towns of Bormio and Livigno, which host part of the Games.",
      "Nature photographer Elio Della Ferrera first spotted the imprints in September in an almost vertical rocky slope.",
      "Some measured up to 16 inches in diameter.",
      "The collection \"extends for hundreds of meters and also represents a series of animal behaviors, because in addition to seeing animals walking together, there are also places where these animals meet,\" Fontana said.",
      "Della Ferrera called in paleontologist Cristiano Dal Sasso from Milan's Natural History Museum, who assembled a team of Italian experts to study the site.",
      "The museum released multiple images of the footprints uncovered in the so-called valley of dinosaurs\u00a0on social media.",
      "\"It's an immense scientific heritage,\" Dal Sasso said in the region's press release.",
      "\"The parallel walks are clear evidence of herds moving in synchrony, and there are also traces of more complex behaviors, such as groups of animals gathered in a circle, perhaps for defense.\"",
      "\"Impressions of the toes and even the claws\"",
      "The tracks, currently covered by snow and off the beaten track, are preserved in Upper Triassic dolomitic rocks, dating back approximately 210 million years.",
      "Most of the footprints are elongated and made by bipeds. The best-preserved ones bear traces of at least four toes.",
      "That suggests they belong to prosauropods, herbivorous dinosaurs with long necks and small heads, which are considered the ancestors of the large sauropods of the Jurassic period like the Brontosaurus, the experts said.",
      "Prosauropods had sharp claws, and adults could reach up to 33 feet in length.",
      "There may also be tracks of predatory dinosaurs and archosaurs, the ancestors of crocodiles, the press release said.",
      "The prints are on an almost-vertical slope due to the formation of the Alpine chain.",
      "But when the dinosaurs walked through the area, it was formed of tidal flats that stretched for hundreds of miles, and the environment was tropical.",
      "\"The tracks were made when the sediments were still soft and saturated with water, on the broad tidal flats surrounding the Tethys Ocean,\" ichnologist Fabio Massimo Petti said, referring to a prehistoric ocean.",
      "\"The plasticity of those very fine calcareous muds, now transformed into rock, has in areas preserved truly remarkable anatomical details, such as impressions of the toes and even the claws,\" he said.",
      "The footprints were then covered by sediments which protected them, but with the uplift of the Alps and the erosion of the mountainside, they have been brought back into view.",
      "\"As the layers containing the tracks are diverse and overlapping, we have a unique opportunity to study the evolution of animals and their environment over time,\" geologist Fabrizio Berra said. \"Like reading the pages of a stone book.\"",
      "Other recent dinosaur track discoveries",
      "Researchers have unearthed other dinosaur footprints recently.",
      "Earlier this month, paleontologists in Bolivia said they found and meticulously documented 16,600 footprints left by theropods, the dinosaur group that includes the Tyrannosaurus rex.",
      "In March,\u00a0scientists in England\u00a0discovered a 650-foot trail of dinosaur footprints made 160 million years ago by massive sauropod dinosaurs.",
      "In January, British researchers unearthed some\u00a0200 dinosaur footprints\u00a0dating back 166 million years in a find believed to be the biggest in the United Kingdom.",
      "That discovery was announced just a few months after a team of paleontologists found\u00a0matching dinosaur footprints\u00a0on what are now two different continents, separated by thousands of miles of ocean.",
      "In October 2023, engineers in the U.K. made a\u00a0\"dramatic discovery\"\u00a0of dinosaur footprints that experts believe could be from a mantellisaurus, a type of dinosaur that had just three toes on each foot and traveled on its hind legs.",

      "When speaking with Peter Lassally, Carson's producer for 22 years, Malkhoff confirmed the infamous \"Tonight Show\" ban list existed.

      "The book says Leno was banned after \"the audience laughs were so light\" during one of his appearances. (Weiss Eubanks/NBCUniversal)",
      "Jay Leno made his \"Tonight Show\" debut in March 1977 and was a smash hit, so much so that he soon became a regular on the show.",
      "Things went wrong, however, after his fifth appearance in February 1978, when \"the audience laughs were so light that Johnny decided never to invite him back,\" according to the book.",
      "\"Tonight Show\" stand-up talent scout Jim McCawley wrote in his unpublished book that producers were told by Carson not to invite Leno back. Malkoff wrote that McCawley tried to fight for Leno, but producer Peter Lassally shut him down.",
      "\"'Johnny just doesn\u2019t like him. He doesn\u2019t like his jokes,' said Peter,\" Malkoff wrote. \"'That\u2019s not going to change\u2026 Once he doesn\u2019t like someone, he doesn\u2019t start liking them later.\"",
      "Leno eventually returned to the show, later going on to host \"The Tonight Show\" for a combined 22 years, first from 1992 to 2009 and then from 2010 to 2014.",
      "Ellen DeGeneres",
      "DeGeneres was reportedly banned for making a joke she was told not to make. (Randy Holmes/Walt Disney Television via Getty Images)",
      "Ellen DeGeneres made history as the first-ever female comedian to be called over to the couch by Carson when she made her first appearance on the show in November 1986.",
      "She returned to the show two more times before upsetting Carson and effectively getting banned for the rest of his tenure as host. According to the show's publicist, Charlie Barrett, Carson told DeGeneres not to make a certain joke during her third appearance in May 1987, but the comedian chose to do so anyway.",
      "\"Barrett was there in the green room after the show when Jim [McCawley] chastised Ellen in front of everyone,\" Malkoff wrote. \"Pointing at her, he said, 'I told you not to do that material.' Barrett recalled Ellen looking embarrassed. Jim made Ellen and her guest leave, saying, 'You won\u2019t be back again too soon.'\"",
      "DeGeneres was effectively banned from the show, as she didn't return until 1989, when Jay Leno was guest hosting.",

      "William Shatner was not asked back after he broke three \"Tonight Show\" rules during his 1983 appearance, becoming \"persona non grata.\"",
      "The \"Star Trek\" actor was unaware of the unwritten rules for guests appearing on the talk show and accidentally broke three. According to the book, Shatner made the mistake of speaking \"monotonously for four minutes straight,\" without letting Carson interject.",
      "\"Second, he turned his back on his host to talk to Buddy Hackett,\" the book states. \"Third, he disregarded the Tonight rule that it was okay to mention your non-NBC TV series but not the network it aired on. Shatner mentioned the show, his series T. J. Hooker, and then also mentioned that it was on ABC. (The word was muted for air.)\"",
      "While Shatner would come back to the show as a guest, it was only with guest hosts, including Jay Leno and Patrick Duffy. Shatner evidently didn't understand why he wasn't asked back, as, according to the book, he later told USA Today that Carson \"would get a hate-on for people\" and decide they would not come back to the show.",

      "That all changed in January 1986, when Sagan corrected Carson twice as the two were discussing Halley's comet.",
      "\"Carson made light of his mistakes. He hid his embarrassment with his affable smile,\" Malkoff wrote. \"Inside, though, he felt slighted. Strange that such a brief exchange carried such a sting, but despite his abiding respect for Sagan, Carson made sure the astrophysicist was not invited back to the talk show that had brought him enviable celebrity status.\"",

      "Dana Carvey was \"permanently banned\" from appearing as a guest on the \"Tonight Show\" in 1990 for pushing the envelope a little too far in a \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch parodying the talk show.",
      "The comedian had been playing Carson in similar sketches since the late 1980s. Jeff Sotzing, a producer on the \"Tonight Show,\" told Malkoff in the book that Carson wasn't a fan, saying, \"I don\u2019t talk like that. I don\u2019t use those expressions,\" with Sotzing adding he thought they made him \"seem like he was old and confused.\"",
      "Despite his dislike of the sketches, Carson continued to have Carvey on the show until a 1990 sketch that portrayed Carson as \"out of touch, unhip and clueless\" while chatting with his guest and competitor Arsenio Hall.",
      "\"After that, Carvey was permanently banned from Tonight,\" the book says. \"Days after the airing of the offending sketch about him and Ed, during his monologue, Johnny referenced it without mentioning the show.

      "Things changed when Welles told Carson that he would be doing a mentalist routine while guest-hosting the show for the fifth time. While Carson was skeptical, he watched as Welles' trick failed, later finding out that the director had hired two men to sit in the audience to help him. The two messed up, leading to Welles' failure.",
      "\"He wasn\u2019t irate because the trick flopped; he was furious that Orson was dishonest,\" Malkoff wrote. \"A magician using audience plants was inexcusable. The towering figure of world cinema and part-time magician never again appeared as a guest with Carson hosting.\"",

      "After Lewis guest hosted for a week, Malkoff writes that the show's cue card guy, Don Schiff, told Carson he would never be in charge of cards when Lewis was guest hosting. When pressed for a reason, Schiff told Carson, Lewis \"got hysterical [and] verbally abusive\" when Schiff told him he couldn't fulfill his request in time.",
      "\"After hearing the story, Johnny made a quick decision,\" the book says. \"Despite Lewis\u2019s being a giant of American entertainment, Johnny was clear: Lewis would never guest-host or appear on the show again. And other than one brief exception, he never did.\"",

      "Things soured between the two of them in October 1982, the final time Allen guest hosted. Malkoff writes that one of the reasons Allen was banned was because he mocked a previous injury suffered by Carson. In addition, word got back to Carson that Allen was rude to crew members for making changes his associates requested.",
      "Infuriated at the changes his own people had requested, Steve phoned the crew member the next day, yelling at them. Word got back to Johnny. The crew member asked never to work with Allen again. Johnny assured him that he wouldn\u2019t have to, because Allen had been banned.",

    "summary": "Legal expert breaks down Nick Reiner&apos;s challenging road ahead in the murder case, from competency evaluations to potential death penalty decisions.",
    "story": [
      "Murphy told Fox News Digital that the case against Nick Reiner is still in the discovery phase.",
      "Attorney Matt Murphy\u00a0is sharing insight into what the road ahead looks like for Nick Reiner after he was taken into custody for allegedly murdering his parents, beloved Hollywood actor and director Rob Reiner, and his wife, Michele Reiner.",
      "When speaking with Fox News Digital, Murphy explained that discovery is still ongoing in this case, saying Nick's lawyer, Alan Jackson, \"needs to carefully review as much discoveries as he can get,\" so that he can \"confidently decide\" if his client should \"just plead not guilty\" or to submit a \"guilty by reason of insanity plea.\"",
      "\"So continuing an arraignment, there's nothing unusual about that. And it's also important to remember that Nick Reiner not being transported \u2013 there's no verdict on that. There's no mental health professional that is making that call. The defense has the unilateral ability to, like I said, declare a doubt. And they can say, 'My client isn't ready to do this yet,' and at this stage, the court basically has to take them at their word.\"",
      "Murphy says Jackson now has to \"get his clients stabilized [and] communicative,\" adding that the next step in the process is to \"hurry up and wait.\" He added that he \"wouldn't be surprised to see this arraignment continued\" a few times, until Jackson \"decides whether or not he's going to enter a plea.\"",
      "Murphy says the case is still in the discovery phase. (Laura Cavanaugh/FilmMagic)",
      "ROB REINER AND WIFE MURDERED: TIMELINE SHOWS ARGUMENT WITH SON NIGHT BEFORE DEATHS",
      "He explained that the defense will likely ask the court for time to evaluate everything, and knowing that this case has the potential for the death penalty, Murphy emphasized that he wouldn't \"want the public's desire for an outcome ever to influence the constitutional rights of a criminal defendant\" and therefore would support that.",
      "\"The defense will then prepare what's known as a live-z packet, or in Los Angeles County, they call it a live z hearing. He's gonna accumulate as much information as he can regarding factors in mitigation,\" he explained. \"In the death penalty analysis, it's about factors in aggravation versus factors in mitigation. And some big factors in mitigation Alan Jackson's gonna argue are, the history of substance abuse, the family dynamics, the fact that these weren't strangers, these were his parents that knew him, et cetera, et cetera et cetera.\"",

      "Jackson will then present the packet to Los Angeles County District Attorney, Nathan Hochman, and his staff.",
      "LEGENDARY DELI MADE FAMOUS BY ROB REINER'S MOST ICONIC MOVIE SCENE",
      "\"Nathan Hockman will then make a decision regarding whether they're gonna seek the death penalty or whether they are simply gonna seek life without possibility of parole,\" Murphy said. \"And again, my prediction is they're going to seek LWOP. They're gonna to seek life without possibility parole. But I could be surprised. I've been wrong before.\"",
      "Murphy predicts Nick will receive a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. (\u00a0Rommel Demano/Getty Images)",
      "After Nick was detained under suspicion of murdering his parents, his history with addiction and mental health struggles have resurfaced.",
      "Murphy predicts Jackson will come in with \"some sort of mental health defense based on the addiction,\" and his struggles with mental health issues, but said there is a difference as far as \"organic mental illness\" goes. Organic mental illness encompasses illnesses such as \"schizophrenia that develops, that is no fault of the defendant.\"",
      "NICK REINER WILL BE CHARGED IN ROB REINER, MICHELE REINER'S DEATHS",
      "\"In other words, they get sick, they get mentally ill, and then they try to self-medicate, or they get into drugs as a result of that,\" Murphy said. \"I haven't heard any of that yet on Nick Reiner.\"",
      "He went on to compare Nick's case to another he worked in Orange County, California, which involved a young man with documented organic mental illness, who murdered his parents and was deemed legally sane and found guilty.",
      "Murphy compared Nick's case to a similar case he worked in Orange County. (Mona Edwards)",
      "\"California uses what's known as The McNaughton Rule,\" Murphy said. \"The McNaughton Rule is about 150 years old, and it basically stands for the proposition that if the criminal defendant understands the nature and quality of their acts, the nature and the quality of the acts at the time they commit the murder, then they are legally responsible even if they're high, even if their drunk, even they're suffering from mental illness.\"",

      "ROB REINER AND WIFE MICHELE WERE FOUND DEAD IN THEIR BEDROOM: LAPD",
      "\"So the way we would explain it to our juries is if the devil pops up on the guy's shoulder and says 'hey go over there and stab that banana,' the person does not understand that they're killing a human being,\" he continued. \"In other words, they don't understand the nature and quality of their acts. However, if it's the devil pops up on your shoulder and says, go kill those people or I'm going to turn you into a frog, you still under the law have a moral and legal responsibility to tell the devil no.\"",
      "WATCH: ATTORNEY MATT MURPHY SAYS IT WOULDN'T SHOCK HIM TO SEE \u2018A BATTLE OF THE EXPERTS\u2019 DURING THE NICK REINER TRIAL",
      "Due to these factors, Murphy said that \"as good as Alan Jackson is, he's up against a tough one,\" adding that being intoxicated is not a \"true defense to murder,\" because if it was, \"nobody would ever be held accountable for murder.\"",
      "In terms of the actual trial, Murphy says that it's possible that the defense will \"declare a doubt regarding the mental competency\" of their client, after which \"the court will appoint two experts to do an evaluation,\" and then \"you wind up with this very long procedural process.\"",

      "Murphy predicts the defense will \"declare a doubt\" about Nick's mental competency. (Michael Buckner/Getty Images for Teen Vogue)",
      "\"Doctors will evaluate Nick Reiner and render their opinions,\" he said. \"And then if he's found to be incompetent, then he goes to a mental health facility. It's locked down for treatment and medication so that he will come back. And sometimes you see, it's almost like a game, a ping pong, where the mental health professionals will certify somebody for competency, send them back to court, and then the defense lawyer will declare a doubt again.\"",
      "Murphy made it clear that the investigation doesn't stop when charges are filed and that both the defense and the prosecution will conduct \"a very dedicated [and a] very professional investigation.\"",
      "WATCH: ATTORNEY MATT MURPHY PREDICTS NICK REINER'S TRIAL \u2018IS GOING TO BE A VERY LONG PROCESS\u2019",
      "A video of Nick walking into a gas station and buying a drink following the murder has since surfaced online, and he allegedly was \"acting bizarrely\" prior to the murders while at Conan O'Brien's holiday party, two things Murphy says \"can cut both ways.\"",
      "\"With a very skilled trial lawyer like Alan Jackson, he's going to argue, 'Look, that means he doesn't know that he did anything wrong,'\" Murphy explained. \"And what the prosecution is going to say is. 'Look, that guy, clearly, he's not howling at the moon. He knows how to use a credit card. He knows that he's dealing with a person behind the register.' And truly, under the law, it's a very, very strict standard under the McNaughton rule.\"",

      "Murphy ended by acknowledging that \"addiction hits almost every family in America,\" and that so many people know someone like Nick, adding about Nick that \"I think it's very clear that he was loved by his parents.\"",
      "\"The number we keep seeing is 17 stints in rehab. I mean, that's two parents that really love their son,\" Murphy said. \"Even to the point that he's 32 years old and they're bringing him to Conan O'Brien's party. So he had a lot of advantages in life, and he's previously described himself as being a spoiled rich kid. So we'll see where this goes. This is gonna be a very, very interesting case to watch.\"",

      "About 10% of people with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) will develop Barrett\u2019s esophagus, a condition where the lining of the lower esophagus is replaced with abnormal cells that are more prone to cancer, according to medical experts.",
      "Some studies have shown that among those with Barrett\u2019s esophagus, between 3% and 13% will go on to develop cancer, but most will not.",
      "POPULAR SLEEP POSITIONS COULD BE DAMAGING YOUR NERVES, ACCORDING TO EXPERTS",
      "When acid reflux becomes dangerous",
      "\"Your stomach is designed to handle acid. Your esophagus is not,\" Dr. Daryl Gioffre, a Florida-based gut health specialist and certified nutritionist, told Fox News Digital.",
      "About 10% of people with chronic acid reflux will develop Barrett\u2019s esophagus, a condition where the lining of the lower esophagus is replaced with abnormal cells that are more prone to cancer. (iStock)",
      "\"With reflux, the danger is not the burn in the chest or throat \u2014 the real danger is the constant backflow of acid traveling the wrong way.\"",
      "In most people, the lower esophageal sphincter \u2014 which Gioffre refers to as the \"acid gate\" \u2014 keeps acid in the stomach, which is lined with thick mucus and specialized cells designed to protect it.",
      "\"With reflux, the danger is not the burn in the chest or throat \u2014 the real danger is the constant backflow of acid traveling the wrong way.\"",
      "\"But when the gate gets weak, it relaxes or stays slightly open, and acid slips back up the wrong way,\" he said. This \"gate\" can weaken with magnesium deficiency, high stress, alcohol, poor sleep, dehydration and late-night snacking, all of which can disrupt healthy digestion.",
      "When acid hits the esophagus, it irritates tissue that was never designed to withstand it, according to the doctor.",
      "\"Every time acid comes back up the wrong way, it injures the lining like a slow chemical burn,\" said Gioffre, who is also the author of \"Get Off Your Acid\" and \"Get Off Your Sugar.\" Over time, that irritation erodes the lining, drives inflammation and can change the cells.",
      "NOT ALL FIBER IS CREATED EQUAL \u2014 DOCTORS SHARE WHICH KINDS TRULY SUPPORT LONGEVITY",
      "\"These new cells are no longer normal esophageal cells \u2014 they begin to shift into cells that look more like stomach lining, because those cells can tolerate the acid,\" the doctor said. \"That change is called metaplasia, or Barrett\u2019s esophagus.\"",
      "Once the cells start changing, the risk of further mutation goes up. If that process continues, Gioffre warned, it can progress to dysplasia, which is the stage right before esophageal cancer.",
      "Some studies have shown that among those with Barrett\u2019s esophagus, between 3% and 13% will go on to develop cancer. (iStock)",
      "\"So the real danger is not the heartburn you feel,\" he summarized. \"It is the repeated acid exposure forcing the esophagus to adapt in ways it was never designed to. Fixing reflux at the root stops this entire cascade before those cellular changes begin.\"",
      "Men at higher risk",
      "Men generally have a higher risk because they burn through magnesium faster, tend to carry more visceral fat pushing upward on the stomach, eat heavier meals and snack late at night, Gioffre cautioned. These activities all weaken the acid gate and shut down healthy digestion.",
      "THE BREAD THAT KEEPS THINGS MOVING IN THE BATHROOM \u2014 AND DOCTORS SAY IT REALLY WORKS",
      "\"Eating within three hours of lying down almost guarantees the stomach does not empty, and that is one of the biggest drivers of nighttime reflux,\" he said. \"On top of that, men often ignore symptoms, or mask them with PPIs and antacids instead of fixing the root cause.\"",
      "All of these factors contribute to a \"perfect storm\" for chronic inflammation and long-term damage, according to Gioffre.",
      "Warning signs",
      "There are certain red flags that indicate when acid reflux has gone beyond an occasional annoyance and has progressed to constant and chronic.",
      "\"If that burn becomes more frequent or more intense, or starts showing up even when you have not eaten, your body is waving a giant warning flag,\" Gioffre said.",
      "Difficulty swallowing, a feeling that food is \"stuck,\" chronic hoarseness, a constant cough, throat clearing or the feeling of a lump in the throat are all indicators that the acid is moving upward into areas it should never reach. (iStock)",
      "Difficulty swallowing, a feeling that food is \"stuck,\" chronic hoarseness, a constant cough, throat clearing or the feeling of a lump in the throat are all indicators that the acid is moving upward into areas it should never reach, according to the doctor.",
      "EXPERT WARNS OF 'SILENT EPIDEMIC' THAT PUTS MEN\u2019S HEALTH AT SERIOUS RISK",
      "\"Ulcers in your throat, or even in your mouth, are another sign that the acid is doing real damage,\" he warned.",
      "\"Another major warning sign is when reflux goes from something you notice occasionally to something you feel every day or every night, or when PPIs and antacids stop helping,\" Gioffre said. \"That usually means the lining is irritated and eroded, and may already be changing on a cellular level.\"",
      "Nighttime reflux is the most dangerous because the acid sits on the esophagus for hours, causing deep inflammation and long-term cellular changes, the doctor said. (iStock)",
      "Unexplained weight loss, vomiting blood and black stools are all serious symptoms that demand immediate attention, the doctor added.",
      "\"The bottom line: When reflux becomes consistent, chronic and starts impacting swallowing, your voice, or the tissues in your mouth or throat, it is no longer just a nuisance,\" Gioffre told Fox News Digital. \"That is the point where the esophagus may be moving toward a precancerous state, and men especially cannot afford to wait on it.\"",

      "Gioffre shared the following essential steps to preventing acid reflux and improving digestive health.",

      "CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"The fastest way to tighten that gate is to build your mineral reserves, especially magnesium,\" he said.",
      "The best way to do this is to load up on magnesium-rich foods like avocado, spinach, pumpkin seeds, chia seeds, quinoa and almonds, and consider adding a clean magnesium supplement.",
      "The fastest way to protect your esophagus, according to Gioffre, is to eliminate or neutralize the foods and habits that weaken the acid gate and push acid the wrong way.",
      "For people who can\u2019t fully eliminate these triggers, certain habits can help neutralize their impact by reducing acid strength and pressure before it reaches the esophagus.",
      "The doctor recommends cutting back on alcohol and caffeine, both of which relax the acid gate and increase the risk of acid reflux. (iStock)",
      "\"Drinking most of your water earlier in the day helps, because pounding water at night stretches the stomach and relaxes the acid gate, making it much easier for acid to flow the wrong way once you lie down,\" he said.",
      "He also recommends cutting back on alcohol and caffeine, both of which relax the acid gate instantly.",
      "TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ",
      "Some other major triggers that fuel the reflux cycle include chocolate, spicy foods, garlic, onions, sugar, ultraprocessed foods and heavy nighttime meals, according to the doctor.",
      "\"These foods and habits weaken the lower esophageal sphincter, drive up inflammation and push pressure upward,\" he said. \"That\u2019s exactly how a little heartburn turns into chronic reflux, and slowly causes the kind of damage that puts the esophagus at risk for cancer.\"",

    "summary": "From a diaper bank in South Carolina to a community clinic in Florida and a village in India, pregnant women are getting a healthier start thanks to free prenatal multivitamins from Vitamin Angels and its partners. Their stories reveal how targeted nutrition support can help moms carry to term and give babies a stronger beginning.",
    "story": [
      "VitaminAngels.org",
      "When Stephanie got pregnant with her first child at age 32, she channeled her limited energy and finances towards things like preparing space in her home and gathering supplies. The task, and cost, of securing and taking prenatal vitamins fell by the wayside.",
      "As an unemployed mom in Columbia, South Carolina, she\u2019s not alone. The state is home to a high number of women of reproductive age who lack health insurance \u2014\u00a0one in eight to be exact \u2014 and even more who don\u2019t have access to proper prenatal care. The effects can be dire, contributing to birth defects, preterm birth, and even infant and maternal death.",
      "But when Stephanie conceived her second child years later at age 41, she had a leg up: Through a local diaper bank called Power in Changing, she received not just diapers, information, support, and other supplies, but also free prenatal vitamins from the global health nonprofit\u00a0Vitamin Angels. Had the supplements not been free, Stephanie said, she likely would have prioritized something else and skipped them once again. That, fortunately, wasn\u2019t the case.",
      "\"With this pregnancy, I took the prenatal and I felt good throughout the whole pregnancy with him\u2026I just overall generally feel healthier,\" Stephanie said. Despite being significantly older, she recovered faster from childbirth too. Stephanie\u2019s second child, she added, \"definitely benefited from having a healthy mom and a healthy start. He\u2019s brought a lot of joy to my life.\"",
      "Prenatal vitamins like those provided by Vitamin Angels are more than nice to have:\u00a0Research shows that pregnant women with inadequate nutrition are more likely to experience complications including post-partum hemorrhage and preterm delivery, and their babies are at higher risk of poor cognitive and physical development.",
      "VitaminAngels.org",
      "\"During pregnancy, a woman\u2019s body works overtime to nourish her baby,\" said\u00a0Colleen\u00a0Delaney, PhD, RDN, a researcher and registered dietitian nutritionist who serves as a technical advisor for Vitamin Angels. Simply eating more doesn\u2019t cut it. Moms with so-called \"hidden hunger\" may not lack calories, \"but they are short on the essential vitamins and minerals needed to support their health and their baby\u2019s development,\" Delaney added. \"Prenatal multivitamins are a simple, proven way to meet that need.\"",
      "But social and economic barriers like unemployment and unstable housing can prevent moms-to-be like Stephanie from taking the vitamins regularly. In fact, more than 1 million underserved pregnant women in the US miss out on important prenatal services, including multivitamins and nutrition support.",
      "That\u2019s where Vitamin Angels comes in. Thanks to donations from individuals and corporate partners like the brain supplement brand\u00a0Prevagen (which acts as a philanthropic collaborator and not a prenatal vitamin maker), pregnant women across the country can receive the supplements free of charge. And importantly, the women access them from local providers they already use and trust.",
      "\"Partners like Power in Changing know their community, they know the mothers they serve by name, and they know the support their clients need,\"\u00a0Ana C\u00e9spedes, Vitamin Angels CEO, said. \"We further support their work by giving them more tools \u2014 a proven prenatal multivitamin and nutrition education \u2014 to put into women\u2019s hands when they need it most.\"",
      "From South Carolina to East India",
      "A few states away from Stephanie, a Florida woman named Ty\u2019hara had trouble finding prenatal care options that accepted her Medicaid coverage. But when she discovered Bond Community Health Center, which provides a wide range of health services, she was able to access and take prenatal vitamins from Vitamin Angels diligently.",
      "VitaminAngels.org",
      "While everyone\u2019s experiences and needs are different, and prenatals should be taken as a part of a healthcare provider\u2019s recommended prenatal care plan, Ty\u2019hara valued the healthy foundation they delivered during her pregnancy. The vitamins help the baby\u2019s organs \"function and form correctly,\" she said, \"as well as\u2026helping me with my iron and minerals and all the things that I need to support successful growth for her.\"",
      "Across the globe in India, a mom-to-be named Santoshini took Vitamin Angels supplements to round out her healthy routine. Like many of her neighbors, she got the vitamins free of charge from a program partner that collaborates with the Indian government to offer health education, childcare, immunizations, and more. \"I feel like these supplements help me get through the day without feeling tired,\" Santoshini said. That\u2019s important because, while she was pregnant, she also cared for her active\u00a0two-year-old son.",
      "Indeed, Vitamin Angels\u2019 impact goes far beyond underserved communities in the US to reach more than 74 million women and children annually in 65 countries worldwide. In low-resource areas, problems from insufficient nutrition from pregnancy until a child\u2019s fifth birthday can include additional and irreversible complications like blindness.",
      "But both at home and away, it doesn\u2019t take much to make a big difference. Case in point: A single dollar donation can impact four children;\u00a0$5 dollars reaches 20.",
      "\"Supporting moms during pregnancy is one of the smartest investments you can make,\"\u00a0Scott Minger, Vitamin Angels Chief Development Officer, said. \"For the cost of a few cups of coffee, we can provide a woman with a full course of prenatal multivitamins that help her stay healthy, carry to term, and welcome a stronger, healthier baby.\"",
      "Prevagen\u2019s leadership agrees the investment is well worth it, said Tom Dvorak, Vice President of Sales and Marketing at Quincy Bioscience. \"At Prevagen, we believe that everyone deserves the opportunity to live a healthy life,\" he said. \"Our partnership with Vitamin Angels allows us to transform that belief into meaningful action by supporting mothers and children with the essential nutrition they need to thrive.\"",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says the Ability Hand brings real touch, natural movement and unmatched durability.",
      "At 18, Jamie Grohsong was living a dream many young athletes chase for years. He was a three-time all-conference shortstop, a Division I college prospect and a player who lived for the game. Then one Fourth of July night in 2023, everything changed. A firework exploded in his hand. In seconds, Jamie lost his pitching hand, his season and what felt like his entire baseball future. The path he had worked toward since childhood disappeared. For a while, Jamie accepted that reality. Baseball, the sport that shaped his identity, was over.",

      "Jamie Grohsong throws a baseball using a bionic prosthetic hand after losing his pitching hand in a fireworks accident. His return shows how technology can help athletes reclaim what they love. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "When technology reopens a closed door",
      "Two years later, Jamie stepped back onto a baseball field wearing something he never imagined using. A bionic prosthetic known as the Ability Hand.",
      "\"The fact that I can feel and sense everything to the finest details opened my mind to the possibility of everything that could actually be done,\" he told CyberGuy.",
      "The goal was not to recreate the past. It was to find out what might still be possible.",
      "Engineers who build advanced prosthetic hands saw Jamie's story and reached out with a simple question. What if he did not have to give up the game entirely? That question started an extraordinary journey that blended grit, patience and cutting-edge engineering.",
      "\"When building the Ability Hand, we prioritized real-life usage,\" Dr. Aadeel Akhtar, founder and CEO of PSYONIC, told CyberGuy. \"While we already put the hand through its fair share of stress tests, baseball is a whole different ball game.\"",
      "Baseball is definitely a brutal test for any piece of equipment. Throwing requires precise release timing. Hitting demands force, stability and follow-through. At first, nothing came easily.",
      "Learning how to throw again",
      "Throwing a baseball with a bionic hand is not about raw strength. It is about timing and grip. The Ability Hand uses muscle sensors that detect subtle movements in the arm. During a throw, many muscles activate at once, which can cause the hand to open too early. Early throws slipped away. Some felt right. Others did not.",
      "Instead of forcing the hand to grip harder, the PSYONIC team adjusted the technique. Jamie learned to hold the ball lightly and let momentum release it naturally. Small grip changes made a real difference. Slowly, throws began to land. Then they became repeatable. For Jamie, each clean throw rebuilt confidence that had been missing for two years.",

      "Just as Jamie started throwing again, another door opened. He received an invitation to throw the ceremonial first pitch at the San Francisco Giants' Oracle Park. It was the team he grew up watching. The timeline was tight. He had barely over a week to prepare.",
      "The pitch was not perfect. That never mattered. Standing on a Major League Baseball field with a bionic hand, Jamie proved something bigger than accuracy. He showed that the game was still part of him. Later, he said the experience taught him that life does not require perfection to be meaningful.",

      "Throwing was only part of the challenge.\u00a0Hitting posed an even bigger question.",
      "\"Swinging a bat was a feeling I didn't think I'd feel again,\" Jamie said.",
      "Engineers discovered that bat placement matters more with prosthetics than with natural hands. When the bionic hand serves as the bottom hand on the bat, impact spreads across the fingers. When it sits on top, stress concentrates on the thumb. Jamie bats left-handed, which placed the prosthetic in a safer position. He told CyberGuy,\u00a0\"I can hit with this thing for sure.\"",
      "Then came the first swings. The sensation was unfamiliar. The contact felt strange. Still, the bat met the ball. One swing turned into another. Soon, balls started flying deep into the field. Then it happened. Jamie sent one over the fence.",
      "A world-first moment",
      "Those swings marked what many believe to be the first documented home runs hit using a multi-articulating bionic hand. For Jamie, it was more than a technical milestone. It was emotional closure and a new beginning at the same time. He was not trying to prove that prosthetics make athletes better. He was proving that they can help people reconnect with what they love. The bionic hand did not replace his identity. It gave him a new way to express it.",

Even so, advanced prosthetics remain expensive and imperfect, and they can break under stress. Because of that, users need time, training and patience to adapt.

      "The FBI is warning about a disturbing scam that turns family photos into powerful weapons. Cybercriminals are stealing images from social media accounts, altering them and using them as fake proof of life in virtual kidnapping scams.",
      "These scams do not involve real abductions. Instead, criminals rely on fear, speed and believable images to pressure victims into paying ransom before they can think clearly.",

      "FACEBOOK SETTLEMENT SCAM EMAILS TO AVOID NOW",
      "Scammers steal photos from public social media accounts and manipulate them to create fake proof of life images that fuel fear and urgency. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the fake kidnapping scam works",
      "According to the FBI, scammers usually start with a text message. They claim they have kidnapped a loved one and demand immediate payment for their release. To make the threat feel real, the criminals send an altered photo pulled from social media. The FBI says these images may be sent using timed messages to limit how long victims can examine them. The agency warns that scammers often threaten extreme violence if the ransom is not paid right away. This urgency is designed to shut down rational thinking.",
      "Signs the photo may be fake",
      "When victims slow down and look closely, the altered images often fall apart. The FBI says warning signs may include missing scars or tattoos, strange body proportions or details that do not match reality. Scammers may also spoof a loved one's phone number, which makes the message feel even more convincing. Reports on sites like Reddit show this tactic is already being used in the real world.",
      "Why this fake kidnapping scam is so effective",
      "Virtual kidnapping scams work because they exploit emotion. Fear pushes people to act fast, especially when the message appears to come from someone they trust. The FBI notes that criminals use publicly available information to personalize their threats. Even posts meant to help others, such as missing person searches, can provide useful details for scammers.",

      "Review the privacy settings on every social platform you use. Set profiles to private so only trusted friends and family can see your photos, posts and personal updates. Virtual kidnapping scams rely heavily on publicly visible images. Limiting access makes it harder for criminals to steal photos and create fake proof-of-life images.",

      "Avoid posting real-time travel updates, daily routines or detailed family information. Even close-up photos that show tattoos, scars or locations can give scammers useful material. The less context criminals have, the harder it is for them to make a threat feel real and urgent.",

Keeping your operating system and security tools updated also closes security gaps that criminals exploit to gather personal data.",

Reducing what is available online makes it harder for scammers to impersonate loved ones or personalize fake kidnapping threats.",

These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "Review older public photo albums and remove images that clearly show faces from multiple angles. Avoid posting large collections of high-resolution facial photos publicly. Scammers often need multiple images to convincingly alter photos. Reducing facial data weakens their ability to manipulate images.",
      "Create a simple verification plan with loved ones before an emergency happens. This may include a shared code word, a call back rule or a second trusted contact. Scammers depend on panic. Having a preset way to verify safety gives you something steady to rely on when emotions run high.",
      "Contact your mobile carrier and ask about SIM protection or a port-out PIN. This helps prevent criminals from hijacking phone numbers or spoofing calls and texts. Since many fake kidnapping scams begin with messages that appear to come from a loved one, securing phone accounts adds an important layer of protection.",
      "The FBI warns that these virtual kidnapping scams often begin with a text message that pressures victims to pay a ransom immediately. (Getty Images)",
      "If you receive a threat, save screenshots, phone numbers, images and message details. Do not continue engaging with the sender. Report the incident to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center. Even if no money is lost, reports help investigators track patterns and warn others.",

      "A major data breach tied to fintech firm Marquis exposed sensitive banking and identity data for hundreds of thousands of people. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What information was stolen in the Marquis cyberattack",
      "According to legally required disclosures filed in Texas, Maine, Iowa, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, hackers accessed a wide range of personal and financial data. Stolen information includes customer names, dates of birth, postal addresses, Social Security numbers and bank account, debit and credit card numbers. The breach dates back to Aug. 14, when attackers gained access through the SonicWall firewall vulnerability. Marquis later confirmed the incident was a ransomware attack.",
      "While Marquis did not publicly name the attackers, the campaign has been widely linked to the Akira ransomware gang. Akira has previously targeted organizations running SonicWall appliances during large-scale exploitation waves. This was not a routine credential leak.",
      "We reached out to Marquis for comment, and a company spokesperson provided CyberGuy with the following statement:",
      "\"In August, Marquis Marketing Services experienced a data security incident. Upon discovery, we immediately enacted our response protocols and proactively took the affected systems offline to protect our data and our customers\u2019 information. We engaged leading third-party cybersecurity experts to conduct a comprehensive investigation and notified law enforcement.",
      "\"The incident was quickly contained, and our investigation was recently completed. It was determined that an unauthorized third party accessed certain non-public information within our network. However, there is no evidence indicating that any personal information has been used for identity theft or financial fraud. We have notified potentially affected individuals.",
      "\"We know our customers place great trust in us, and at Marquis, we take that responsibility seriously by making the protection of their information our highest priority. We are extremely appreciative of the cooperation, understanding, and support of our employees and customers during this time.\"",
      "HOW TO STOP IMPOSTOR BANK SCAMS BEFORE THEY DRAIN YOUR WALLET",
      "Why the Marquis data breach creates long-term identity risk",
      "When a data breach exposes your full identity, the danger does not disappear after the news cycle ends. Unlike a stolen password, this kind of information cannot be changed, which means the risk can stick around for a long time.",
      "\"With a typical credential leak, you reset passwords, rotate tokens and move on,\" Ricardo Amper, CEO and Founder of Incode Technologies, a digital identity verification company, tells CyberGuy. \"But core identity data is static. You cannot meaningfully change your date of birth or SSN, and once those are exposed, they can circulate on criminal markets for years. The breach is a moment in time, but the exposure it creates can follow people for the rest of their financial lives.\"",
      "That is why identity breaches are so dangerous. Criminals can reuse the same stolen data years later to open new accounts, build fake identities or run highly targeted scams that feel personal and convincing. Many attackers now combine this data with AI tools to scale their efforts. As a result, phishing emails, phone calls and even voice impersonations are harder to spot when they reference real details about your bank or account history.",
      "The most likely scams after identity data is stolen",
      "When criminals obtain verified identity data, fraud becomes targeted rather than opportunistic.",
      "\"Once criminals get their hands on rich, verified identity data, fraud stops being a guessing game and becomes a targeted execution,\" Amper said.",
      "The first major threat is account takeover. With enough personal details, attackers can bypass knowledge-based checks, reset passwords, change contact information and abuse accounts in ways that often look legitimate. The second risk is new account fraud. This includes credit cards, loans, buy now pay later services and even new bank accounts. High-quality data helps these applications pass automated systems and manual reviews.",
      "The fastest-growing threat is synthetic identity fraud. Real data, like a Social Security number, is blended with fabricated details to create a new identity that matures over time before a large financial bust.",
      "\"These attacks are hard to catch early because the data being presented is accurate and often reused across multiple institutions,\" Amper noted. \"If your defenses can't reliably tell a real human from an AI-generated impersonation, you are starting every decision from a position of disadvantage,\" he added.",
      "Why unpatched firewall flaws pose such a serious threat",
      "Ransomware groups like Akira increasingly focus on widely deployed infrastructure to maximize impact. Firewalls sit at the boundary of trusted networks. When one is compromised, everything behind it becomes reachable.",
      "\"What we're seeing with groups like Akira is a focus on maximizing impact by targeting widely used infrastructure. The strategy remains the same: Find a single weak point that gives access to many downstream victims at once,\" Amper said.",
      "This approach exposes a persistent blind spot in traditional cybersecurity thinking. Many organizations still assume traffic passing through a firewall is safe.",
      "\"When the perimeter device itself is the entry point, static defenses and outdated controls simply can't keep up,\" Amper explained.",
      "Hackers accessed names, Social Security numbers and bank details by exploiting an unpatched firewall vulnerability.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How long affected consumers should assume risk remains high",
      "Identity data does not expire. Social Security numbers and birth dates stay the same for life.",
      "\"When core identity data reaches criminal markets, the risk does not fade quickly,\" Amper emphasized. \"Fraud rings treat stolen identity data like inventory. They hold it, bundle it, resell it and combine it with information from new breaches.\"",
      "Warning signs of misuse can be subtle. These include credit inquiries you did not authorize, account recovery alerts from unfamiliar services or phone calls that convincingly mimic a bank's verification process using deepfake voice tools.",
      "\"The most damaging fraud often starts long after the breach is no longer in the news,\" Amper added.",
      "The overlooked impact of identity theft",
      "Financial losses are only part of the damage. Victims often experience a lasting erosion of trust.",
      "Amper says, \"The most overlooked consequence is the psychological toll of knowing that you can no longer trust who is contacting you. Deepfake impersonation turns every phone call, video message or urgent request into a potential attack.\"",
      "Ways to stay safe after the Marquis data breach",
      "When a breach exposes Social Security numbers, bank details and birth dates, the risk does not end with a password reset. These steps focus on protections that reduce long-term identity misuse and help you detect fraud early.",
      "A credit freeze prevents criminals from opening new accounts in your name using stolen identity data. This is critical after the Marquis breach, where full identity profiles were exposed. Freezing credit does not affect your score and can be lifted temporarily when needed. Place a free credit freeze with Equifax, Experian and TransUnion online or by phone. Each bureau must be contacted separately. Once frozen, new credit cannot be opened unless you temporarily lift or remove the freeze using a PIN or account login.",
      "A fraud alert tells lenders to take extra steps to verify your identity before approving credit. It adds protection if you are not ready to freeze credit everywhere or want an extra layer on top of a freeze. Fraud alerts last for one year and can be renewed. You only need to contact one credit bureau to place a fraud alert. Equifax, Experian or TransUnion will notify the others for you. Fraud alerts are free and last for one year.",
      "Turn on alerts for withdrawal, purchase, login attempts and password changes across all financial accounts. Real-time alerts can help you catch account takeovers or unauthorized activity before serious damage occurs.",
      "Check statements and credit reports often, even months or years after the breach. Identity data from incidents like this is frequently reused later for delayed fraud. Watch for unfamiliar accounts, hard inquiries or small test charges.",
      "Text message codes can be intercepted or socially engineered. Where possible, switch to app-based or hardware-backed two-factor authentication. These options are harder for attackers to bypass, even when they know your personal details.",
      "Biometrics tied to your physical device add a layer that criminals cannot easily replicate. Face and fingerprint authentication help block account takeovers driven by stolen identity data or AI-powered impersonation.",
      "Reputable antivirus software helps detect malicious links, fake login pages and follow-up attacks that target breach victims. This adds protection against phishing and ransomware tied to identity-based scams.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Data brokers collect and resell personal information that can be combined with breach data to fuel targeted fraud. A data removal service reduces how much of your personal information is publicly available and lowers your exposure over time.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",
      "Experts warn this type of identity exposure can fuel fraud and scams for years after the breach is discovered. (Kurt \u2018CyberGuy\u2019 Knutsson)",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web: Cyberguy.com.",
      "Identity theft services monitor credit files, dark web markets and account activity for signs that your stolen data is being misused. Many also offer recovery assistance in the event of fraud, which can save time and stress when dealing with banks, credit bureaus and government agencies. This monitoring is especially useful after breaches like Marquis, where identity data can resurface long after the initial incident.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Be cautious of urgent calls, emails or texts that reference real banking or personal details. Scammers now use accurate breach data to sound legitimate. Hang up and contact your bank directly using the number on your card or official website.",
      "Create or secure online accounts with the IRS, Social Security Administration and your state tax agency. Enable strong authentication and monitor for unexpected notices. Stolen identity data is often used for tax refund fraud or benefit scams long after a breach.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The Marquis data breach highlights how dangerous unpatched infrastructure vulnerabilities have become for the financial sector. When a single vendor holds data for hundreds of institutions, the fallout spreads quickly. For you, identity protection is no longer a one-time response. It is an ongoing necessity that can last years beyond the initial breach.",

      "How AI photo matching kept the search going",
      "Pam's 11-year-old indoor cat, Grayson, had never been outside alone. She believes he slipped out while she unloaded groceries at their home in Plano, Texas. The moment she realized he was gone, she acted fast.",
      "She said, \"We went up and down the streets day and night. We went online in the neighborhood and on Love Lost. We put up flyers all over the neighborhood. Friends and neighbors were looking for him. I went to the animal shelter, posted him there, and went every day for over a month, hoping to find him.\"",
      "Pam uploaded Grayson's photo to Petco Love Lost right away. She checked her daily match alerts and hoped she would see his familiar face pop up. She told CyberGuy, \"I received match alerts almost every day from Lost Love, but never saw Grayson. His profile had been on their site for over 90 days.\"",
      "The moment everything changed",
      "Missy, a nearby resident, spotted a thin cat in an alley near her home. She brought him inside, took a picture of him and then turned to Love Lost to see if anyone had reported a missing cat like him.",
      "Missy explained how simple the process felt. \"I used Lost Love to reunite them,\" she said. \"I uploaded a photo of the cat that we found, and it was matched through AI with the photo that the owner uploaded.\"",
      "She soon received an AI match alert and learned that the cross street Grayson's owner, Pam, had listed in her lost post was only a mile from her home. Missy contacted Pam right away.",
      "That message changed everything. \"I am sure that if we had not posted his picture and enabled the ability to match the images, we would never have known what happened to Grayson,\" Pam said. \"And we would not have connected with Missy.\"",

      "A long road for an aging cat",
      "Grayson is almost 12 and has never lived outdoors. That made this reunion feel even more emotional, Pam said.",
      "\"I am still amazed at Grayson's journey,\" she added. \"I look at him and cannot believe he made it through those 103 days. He is almost 12 years old, so he is not a young kitty.\"",
      "Pam said she still thinks about what those months were like for him. \"[I] guess I will always wonder where he was and how many stops he made before he reached Missy's loving home,\" she said. \"He must have known she would take care of him. It takes a special person to take the time to reunite a beloved pet with their family. Missy and her family went above and beyond to reunite us with Grayson.\"",
      "Why pet tech matters during the holidays",
      "This season brings joy but also risks for pets. Visitors, travel and loud celebrations create more chances for animals to slip out or feel spooked. Tools like AI photo matching help families act fast when a pet goes missing. Love Lost connects shelters and neighbors in one place so that people like Pam and Missy can find each other.",
      "What to do if your pet goes missing",
      "Losing a pet can feel overwhelming, but taking fast action helps. These steps guide you through what to do right away.",
      "Look in closets, garages and under furniture. Walk your street and ask neighbors to check yards and sheds.",
      "Take a clear photo and post it on the site. AI photo matching alerts you when a possible match appears. It also helps others contact you fast.",
      "Shelters update kennels throughout the day. Staff can guide you and help flag your pet's profile. Go often until you get updates.",
      "Use neighborhood apps, local Facebook groups and community forums. Include your pet's photo, last known location and your contact info.",
      "Use a large photo and simple details. Place flyers at busy intersections and near schools, parks and businesses.",
      "If your pet is microchipped, call the registry or log in to your account. Make sure the chip is registered to you, update your contact info and mark your pet as missing so shelters and vets can reach you fast.",
      "Check Love Lost alerts often. Visit shelters and follow up on every lead. Persistence made the difference for Pam and Grayson.",

      "How AirTags can help you find a lost pet faster",
      "While tools like AI photo matching are invaluable after a pet goes missing, prevention and real-time tracking can make an enormous difference during the first critical hours. That's where Apple AirTags come in. An AirTag isn't a GPS tracker, but it can still be a powerful recovery tool when used correctly. When attached securely to your pet's collar, an AirTag uses Apple's vast Find My network. That network consists of hundreds of millions of nearby iPhones, iPads and Macs that can anonymously and securely relay the AirTag's location back to you.",
      "If your pet wanders into a neighborhood, apartment complex or busy area, the chances are high that another Apple device will pass nearby and update the location automatically. You won't know who helped, and they won't know it was them, but the location can show up on your map within minutes. For indoor cats or dogs that don't usually roam far, this can be especially helpful. Even a rough location can narrow your search area and save precious time.",
      "Important limits to know: AirTags work best in populated areas. They rely on nearby Apple devices, so coverage may be limited in rural or remote locations. They also don't update continuously like true GPS pet trackers. That's why AirTags should be seen as a backup layer, not a replacement for microchipping or dedicated pet trackers.",
      "How to use an AirTag safely with pets",
      "Use a\u00a0secure, pet-specific AirTag holder that won't break easily.Attach it to a\u00a0breakaway collar\u00a0for cats and dogs to reduce injury risk.Make sure\u00a0Find My notifications are turned on so you get alerts quickly.Combine it with\u00a0microchipping and ID tags for the best protection.",

This next-generation wearable blends artificial intelligence (AI), a forward-facing camera, LADAR sensors and lightweight robotics to give your legs a serious boost on trails and city streets.",
      "It scans the terrain ahead and predicts how much assistance you will need before your foot lands, rather than waiting to react after impact. The result feels smoother and easier than many older systems that rely mainly on reactive support.",
      "IRMO spun out of research from Beihang University in Beijing. Its team built the M1 to act like an all-terrain, adaptive suspension system for your legs, tuned for real-world walking and hiking conditions.

IRMO says the system can take as much as 50 pounds of stress off your knees, which can help reduce fatigue on long days outside.",
      "Inside the frame sits a nine-axis IMU paired with an AI engine that studies your gait in real time. This lets the M1 fine-tune each push as it learns how you move. That alone puts it in line with top performance exoskeletons, but IRMO adds something new that it says shifts the entire experience.",
      "Terrain-aware AI that looks ahead while you move",
      "The M1 scans a four-foot radius around you with camera and laser-rangefinder sensors. This lets it read the terrain before you reach it. The system adjusts power output based on what is coming up next. If the M1 detects stairs, grass, sand or slopes, it prepares your legs with added support or added control.",
      "It can help you climb with more power, absorb impact on jumps and steady your pace on steep declines. IRMO says this predictive shift can reduce knee impact by up to 60%. You can use the M1 for hiking, running, jumping, cycling and even sports like basketball or tennis. If you want to build strength, you can switch from assist to resistance mode.",

      "You can buy the IRMO M1 through its Kickstarter campaign, which runs until early January 2026. Prices start at $399 for the M1 Neo tier and rise through several launch specials that offer different levels of power, weight and features. Higher tiers include models like the M1 Pro and M1 Ultra, which add stronger motors, lighter frames and longer battery performance. Each pledge level lists what comes in the box, including the main units, straps, charger, battery pack, user manual and packaging. Shipping is global with an estimated delivery window of May 2026.",

      "Any data breach affecting 1.6 million people is serious. It draws even more attention when it involves a company trusted to guard passwords. That is exactly what happened to LastPass.",
      "The U.K. Information Commissioner's Office has fined LastPass about $1.6 million for security failures tied to its 2022 breach. Regulators say those failures allowed a hacker to access a backup database and put users at risk.",

      "CHECK IF YOUR PASSWORDS WERE STOLEN IN HUGE LEAK",
      "Why the LastPass breach still matters",
      "LastPass is one of the most widely used password managers in the world. It serves more than 20 million individual users and around 100,000 businesses. That popularity also makes it an attractive target for cybercriminals.",
      "The U.K. Information Commissioner's Office fined LastPass for security failures tied to its 2022 breach. (LaylaBird/Getty Images)",
      "In 2022, LastPass confirmed that an unauthorized party accessed parts of its customer information through a third-party cloud storage service. While the incident initially raised alarms, the long-term impact has taken time to fully surface.",
      "The ICO now says the breach affected about 1.6 million U.K. users alone. That scope played a major role in the size of the fine.",
      "What regulators say went wrong",
      "According to the ICO, LastPass failed to put strong enough technical and security controls in place. Those gaps made it possible for attackers to reach a backup database that should have been better protected.",
      "The regulator added that LastPass promises to help people improve security, but failed to meet that expectation. As a result, users were left exposed even if their passwords were not directly cracked.",
      "Were passwords exposed or decrypted?",
      "There is still no evidence that attackers decrypted customer passwords. That point matters.",
      "Despite the breach, security experts continue to recommend password managers for most people. Storing unique, strong passwords in an encrypted vault is still far safer than reusing weak passwords across accounts.",
      "As one expert noted, modern breaches often succeed after identity access rather than password cracking alone. Once attackers get a foothold, the damage can spread quickly.",
      "Although attackers accessed a backup database, there is no evidence that customer passwords were decrypted. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why the LastPass fine is a wake-up call for cybersecurity",
      "The ICO called the LastPass fine a turning point. It reinforces the idea that security is about governance, staff training and supplier risk as much as software.",
      "Users have a right to expect that companies handling sensitive data take every reasonable step to protect it.",

While we are disappointed with the outcome, we are pleased to see that the ICO\u2019s decision has recognized many of the efforts we have already taken to further strengthen our platform and enhance our data security measures.

Still, this case shows why you should stay alert even when using trusted brands. Strong settings, regular reviews and layered protection matter more than ever.

The move overrides a formal recommendation from the city\u2019s appointments committee to leave the seat vacant and has reignited criticism from law enforcement officials who condemned his early release as \"shocking and irresponsible.\"",

Committee members Mayor Julie Hoy and Councilors Shane Matthews and Deanna Gwyn argued that bypassing those standards risks creating a precedent for future board selections.

    "story": [
      "Fox News Digital spoke with attorney Wendy Murphy about a recently released independent report on the decades of sexual abuse allegations at Miss Hall's School in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.",
      "A prestigious all-girls boarding school in Massachusetts, where students pay up to $79,000 a year for tuition and room and board, is facing a sweeping sexual-abuse scandal after a newly released independent investigation found decades of misconduct by multiple employees and years of institutional failures that allowed alleged predators to remain in the classroom.",
      "The investigation centers on former Miss Hall\u2019s School history teacher Matthew Rutledge, who taught at the elite Pittsfield, Massachusetts, campus for more than 30 years. According to the Aleta Law investigative report, Rutledge engaged in a long pattern of grooming, sexualized behavior and sexual assault of students beginning in the 1990s. Five former students came forward with firsthand accounts.",
      "The findings go far beyond Rutledge, with the 60-page report outlining eight substantiated cases of sexual misconduct by former Miss Hall\u2019s employees from the 1940s through the 2010s, including teachers who allegedly exploited students emotionally, crossed physical boundaries, engaged in sexualized conduct or committed sexual assault.",

      "Two former Miss Hall\u2019s students, Hilary Simon and Melissa Fares, have sued the school, alleging negligence and emotional and physical harm. Both women testified before the Massachusetts Joint Committee on the Judiciary in June, urging lawmakers to strengthen protections for students.",
      "\"What began as compliments and extra attention turned into forcible touching and sexual intercourse with this man who is 25 years older than me,\" Simon testified. \"He isolated me physically and emotionally.\"",
      "Rutledge has never been criminally charged.",
      "\"This is where Massachusetts is way behind,\" Wendy Murphy, a Massachusetts-based attorney and national advocate for sexual-assault survivors, told Fox News Digital. \"The law treats these students as if they\u2019re capable of consenting, but consent isn\u2019t real when the perpetrator is in a position of authority over you.\"",
      "The Berkshire District Attorney's Office concluded in October 2024 that under Massachusetts\u2019s General Law, no criminal conduct occurred.",
      "\"Massachusetts law\u00a0defines\u00a0the age of consent\u00a0as\u00a016. While the alleged behavior is profoundly troubling,\u00a0it is not illegal,\" District Attorney Timothy Shugrue said.",

The report concluded that the school's leadership \"failed to adequately investigate and respond.\"",
      "A recent Vanity Fair investigation likewise reported that school officials were alerted to Rutledge\u2019s concerning behavior as early as 2005, and that administrators at one point instructed him to cease contact with a former student, but allowed him to remain in the classroom.",
      "\"The investigation revealed horrible truths about a community we hold dear,\" Head of School Julia Heaton wrote in a letter to the Miss Hall\u2019s community.",
      "The Aleta Law report describes a school environment in the 1990s and 2000s where teachers regularly spent time alone with students, invited them into faculty apartments, gave personal gifts and blurred emotional and physical boundaries.",
      "Several employees admitted they suspected inappropriate relationships involving Rutledge but feared retaliation or believed leadership \"would not listen.\" Students who raised concerns about other teachers in past decades reported being ignored, discouraged or even punished.",
      "\"It\u2019s very common for schools to get rid of the noisemaker\u2014the victim who won\u2019t shut up,\" Murphy said. \"The message becomes: if you complain, you\u2019ll be punished.\"",
      "\"If a teacher hurt a Jewish or Asian student, they\u2019d be fired instantly. But when the victim is a girl, schools often treat the abuse as less serious. Girls keep getting second-class treatment,\" she said. \"Victims have a long, long time to file lawsuits.\"",

      "Murdaugh defense lawyer Dick Harpootlian recently released a true-crime book about notorious 1970s serial killer Donald \"Pee Wee\" Gaskins. (Fox News Digital)",
      "Alex Murdaugh\u2019s defense team is \"cautiously optimistic\" that the disgraced former South Carolina attorney could win a new trial when the state Supreme Court hears arguments in February, his lawyer Dick Harpootlian said.",
      "Harpootlian, who represents Murdaugh alongside attorney Jim Griffin, said the court will consider two consolidated appeals when it hears oral arguments Feb. 11, one challenging a legal ruling made during the 2023 murder trial and another on Court Clerk Rebecca \"Becky\" Hill\u2019s alleged jury tampering.",
      "\"There\u2019s two basic appeals that have been consolidated,\" Harpootlian said in an interview with Fox News Digital. \"One is the underlying trial \u2013 the legal technical issues that you see in every appeal. And there\u2019s an additional appeal that\u2019s very unusual: did the clerk of court say things or do things in an effort to have the jury vote guilty?\"",

      "The second appeal centers on Hill, who was accused of making comments to jurors during the trial that defense attorneys say were intended to influence a guilty verdict.",
      "Hill pleaded guilty in Colleton County Circuit Court to four charges \u2014 obstruction of justice and perjury for showing a reporter photographs that were sealed court exhibits and then lying about it \u2014 as well as two counts of misconduct in office for taking bonuses and promoting through her public office a book she wrote about the trial.",
      "WATCH: Buster Murdaugh says he does not believe the trial was fair",
      "Judge Heath Taylor sentenced Hill to a year of probation. He told Hill her sentence would have been much harsher had prosecutors found that she had tampered with the Murdaugh jury. Harpootlian said Hill\u2019s guilty plea bolsters the defense\u2019s argument that her credibility is irreparably damaged.",
      "\"She pled guilty to perjuring herself, to lying under oath during that hearing,\" he said. \"I think that goes a long way to showing in appellate court that whatever she said shouldn\u2019t be believed.\"",

      "During the evidentiary hearing, multiple witnesses testified that Hill made comments to jurors about Murdaugh\u2019s demeanor and testimony, including statements that defense attorneys argue crossed the line from administration into influence.",
      "Hill has denied trying to sway jurors, but Judge Jean Toal ruled last year that the defense failed to prove the comments affected the verdict. Harpootlian said the defense disagrees with that standard.",
      "\"The United States Supreme Court and the Fourth Circuit have indicated we don\u2019t have to show that it actually influenced somebody,\" he said. \"We just need to show that she said things that reasonably, objectively could have influenced a juror.\"",

      "\"There are a couple dozen different issues that have to be addressed,\" he said. \"Any one of which could give us a new trial. We\u2019re cautiously optimistic, but you don\u2019t know until you get there and hear their questions.\"",

      "While cruise ships have long served as a favorite of Americans looking for a vacation, headlines highlighting violent crimes have marred the industry for decades.",
      "Over the years, stories of lawlessness on cruises have both captivated and horrified travelers, with experts often pointing out how the unique environment often serves as a hotbed for bad actors and troublesome events.",
      "\"Just like subways invite crime because criminals have a \u2018captive audience,\u2019 cruise passengers are \u2018captive\u2019 for an even longer time, as jumping off into the ocean is not really an option,\" Dr. Carole Lieberman, a forensic psychiatrist, told Fox News Digital. \"A cruise ship feels like a world unto its own. It feels like you\u2019re on another planet or at least another country, so it seems like there are fewer consequences.\"",
      "The sense of fewer consequences is echoed by Chicago-based attorney Andrew Stoltmann, who added that cruise ship passengers are subjected to the local laws wherever the ship is docked.",

      "\"Maritime law is extremely complex, and it shifts depending on location,\" Stoltmann said. \"Whatever flag the ship flies, that law is what is applicable while the ship is sailing. But while the ship is docked, it is that country's law that applies. This makes it extremely complex, and many times it\u2019s hard to figure out.\"",
      "Ultimately, experts point to a mixture of relaxed inhibitions and inconsistent methods of reporting crimes as some of the major catalysts for headlines involving murders, rapes and vacationers going missing on the high seas.",
      "\"There\u2019s obviously a perception by the public that these cruise ships are very safe, and they have their own police force or security force,\" Stoltmann said. \"Unfortunately, this usually simply isn\u2019t true. And because these ships are often in international waters, many of the same legal protections we enjoy here in the United States simply aren\u2019t applicable on the high seas.\"",
      "In recent months, headlines about cruise trouble have included the mysterious death of Florida teen Anna Kepner and a lawsuit filed by the family of a man who says their loved one was killed after Royal Caribbean served him nearly three dozen alcoholic drinks.

Australian officials have said the shooters were inspired by Islamic State ideology, and homemade ISIS banners were found inside their vehicle.",

Andy Barr, R-Ky., told Fox News Digital, \"We must stay on offense and never return to the weak policies. Under President Trump, American strength is back, and terrorists know it. Iran\u2019s nuclear program was crippled, ISIS\u2019s leadership was crushed, and a clear message was sent: If you threaten Americans, you will be eliminated.\"",

      "Barnea also warned that Iran\u2019s use of terrorism is inseparable from its broader strategic ambitions, including its nuclear program.

      "\"Margarita Island might be of significance to the U.S. because of its location and the security dynamics around it,\" Melissa Ford Maldonado, director of the Western Hemisphere Initiative at the America First Policy Institute, told Fox News Digital. \"It is close to Trinidad and Tobago and Grenada, in an oil-rich part of the Caribbean along key maritime routes, and it has long had a reputation for being a major drug-trafficking hub, possibly because it\u2019s off the mainland, and there\u2019s not a lot of law enforcement there.\"",

He said the group operates a wide range of companies on the island and also maintains several training camps there.",

    "summary": "How the divide between Rubio and Witkoff plays out could determine how the war in Ukraine ends and how the U.S. is perceived by its allies and adversaries.",
    "story": [
      "The wedding ceremony was scheduled to kick off at 3 p.m. at a lavish 56-acre estate in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Seated in the audience on that November afternoon was a high-profile guest, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who may have had other things on his mind.",
      "Over the past 48 hours, Rubio had been grappling with a snowballing diplomatic crisis after the leak of a U.S.-backed peace plan spearheaded by President Donald Trump\u2019s envoy, Steve Witkoff, that was seen as tilting heavily in favor of Russia over Ukraine.",
      "Now Rubio, among the crowd at the black-tie affair where his two daughters were bridesmaids, was dealing with a different headache caused by the same man, according to a U.S. official.",
      "Rubio was scheduled to attend peace talks with Ukrainian officials in Switzerland, but Witkoff had set off early in what some officials saw as a bid to beat him to the punch, according to two U.S. officials and a person familiar with the episode. Witkoff did not communicate his travel plans to Rubio and other State Department officials, the three sources said, in what they perceived as a move to allow Witkoff to negotiate with Ukraine in a way he saw fit.",
      "Rubio ultimately made it to Geneva, ensuring that Witkoff would not be meeting the Ukrainian officials without him, according to the three sources.",
      "It was not the first time U.S. officials had seen Witkoff\u2019s actions as an attempt to make an end-run around Rubio. The episode, which has not been previously reported, was the latest example of a long-running rift between the two senior figures in the Trump administration with sharply different views about how to end the war in Ukraine and how much the U.S. should trust Russia\u2019s promises.",
      "\u201cThey seem to be singing off of a different sheet of music,\u201d said Alexander Vershbow, a former career diplomat who was ambassador to NATO. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t have a common understanding of the problems and of your adversary in a negotiation, it can\u2019t be good.\u201d",
      "Eager to strike a quick deal as ordered by Trump, Witkoff has pushed for proposals that put the onus on Ukraine to make concessions, give up territory and accept risks to its future security. Rubio and some other officials in the administration favor imposing more economic and military pressure on Russia to force Russian President Vladimir Putin to make concessions and allow a secure future for Ukraine, a view shared by America\u2019s European allies.",
      "This account is based on interviews with more than a dozen current and former U.S. and European officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive events.",
      "State Department spokesman Tommy Pigott pushed back on the suggestion that Rubio and Witkoff were not in tune.",
      "\u201cThere is no rift between the two and has never been,\u201d Pigott said in a statement. \u201cSecretary Rubio and Special Envoy Witkoff have a close working relationship and are personal friends. They are both fully aligned on the president\u2019s goals and each is carrying out President Trump\u2019s vision on how to end the war and achieving peace in complete cooperation.\u201d",
      "Rubio himself offered a similar assessment at a news conference Friday.",
      "\u201cNo one is out there doing independent action,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of it is strongly coordinated.\u201d",
      "He described Witkoff as a \u201cphenomenal person, very smart, very talented,\u201d who \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid to do this job.\u201d",
      "But some current and former U.S. officials have concerns about Witkoff that go beyond his handling of negotiations to end the war. He is seen as having a lax approach to security, according to five current and former U.S. officials, raising fears that he may be using insecure communications that could make him vulnerable to a foreign actor eavesdropping on his conversations.",
      "Witkoff referred questions from NBC News to the White House.",
      "\u201cSpecial Envoy Witkoff takes multiple secure calls throughout the week in coordination with the National Security Council and the White House,\" spokeswoman Anna Kelly said. His phone, residence, and vehicles are regularly swept\u201d by diplomatic security.",
      "How the divide between Rubio and Witkoff plays out could determine how the war in Ukraine ends and how America is perceived by its allies and adversaries.",
      "Witkoff, 69, a billionaire real estate mogul, has broken with convention in his role as freewheeling diplomat and fixer, jetting to Russia to meet with Putin and senior Arab figures in the Middle East aboard his own plane.",
      "Witkoff now has another key player on his side \u2014 Trump\u2019s influential son-in-law Jared Kushner, who accompanied him on a recent trip to Moscow. Although he holds no official government position, Kushner carries weight with Trump and had a significant role in clinching a ceasefire agreement in Gaza between Israel and Hamas, according to current and former officials.",
      "For Trump, Witkoff is a personal friend and a skilled negotiator with a \u201cgreat personality\u201d who can tackle any dispute. In remarks Tuesday, Trump praised Witkoff\u2019s role in helping secure the ceasefire deal in Gaza.",
      "\u201cSteve\u2019s a great dealmaker,\u201d he said.",
      "But for critics in Congress and in Europe, as well as skeptics inside the administration, Witkoff is an amateur in the diplomatic arena too willing to accept Russia\u2019s assertions at face value.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a gift to the Russians,\u201d said a congressional official.",
      "Meeting with Macron",
      "Competing factions and power plays are common in presidential administrations. But the extent to which the secretary of state is taking a back seat to a diplomatic neophyte on what is one of the most complicated and vexing foreign policy challenges facing the U.S. is highly unusual and concerning, current and former officials say.",
      "An episode in France is illustrative.",
      "In April, Rubio was scheduled to fly to Paris for Ukraine talks. But before he left, his team learned that Witkoff had arranged a one-on-one meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, according to a senior administration official, a U.S. official and a former French official.",
      "Rubio asked to join the meeting, but the French foreign ministry said Witkoff needed to sign off on the change. It was a humiliating turn of events for Rubio, whose aides struggled to reach Witkoff for some time. In the end, Rubio finally tracked down Witkoff, who agreed to allow Rubio to join him in the meeting, according to the U.S. official and the senior administration official.",
      "Rubio did ultimately meet one-on-one with Macron on the trip, according to his public schedule.",
      "Pigott, the State Department spokesman, said \u201cany insinuation that Special Envoy Witkoff was blocking the Secretary from attending a meeting in Paris is absurd.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Secretary\u2019s multiple meetings in Paris, both with and without the Special Envoy, and their close cooperation before, during, and since then, speak for themselves,\u201d Pigott added.",
      "Late last month, days after the Geneva talks, Witkoff arranged a meeting with Ukrainian officials in Florida. Rubio became aware of the planned session only when the Ukrainians asked his team about it, according to a U.S. official and a person familiar with the incident.",
      "A senior administration official said: \u201cIt is so clear that Rubio has been cut out of this. He should be the guy leading all of this.\u201d",
      "John Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, said, \u201cWitkoff understands that Rubio\u2019s understanding of Russia is very different from his own, and since he\u2019s a competitive guy who\u2019s always been close to Trump, he figures he can have his way.\u201d",
      "Security concerns",
      "Apart from disagreements about peace efforts in Ukraine, Witkoff has been at loggerheads with Rubio and State Department officials about the way he handles security \u2014 especially on his trips to Russia.",
      "From the beginning of the administration, Witkoff and State Department officials have clashed over how to ensure secure communications on his private plane and security guards for the aircraft, according to two U.S. officials and a senior administration official.",
      "Some administration officials have privately questioned the wisdom of Witkoff\u2019s using his own jet when there is a government fleet available for diplomats traveling on foreign assignments, according to three U.S. officials.",
      "Witkoff\u2019s lack of secure communications aboard his plane prompted alarm at the State Department that culminated in a high-level review in May, leading to a concerted effort to provide Witkoff with additional security, according to a senior administration official, a U.S. official and two former senior administration officials.",
      "As a result, those sources say, the State Department provided a secure mobile communications system for Witkoff to be used on his plane.",
      "But there are still concerns that Witkoff is not consistently using the secure government communications system, according to a U.S. official and a source with knowledge.",
      "Scott Stewart, who was a special agent with the State Department for 10 years and is now vice president of intelligence of the security firm TorchStone Global, said a host of foreign actors would be interested in gaining access to Witkoff\u2019s communications.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a huge target for the Russians specifically, but certainly almost anyone else in the world that\u2019s interested in finding out what\u2019s going on with this negotiation, and there are a lot of people that are interested,\u201d Stewart said.",
      "Kelly, the White House spokesperson, said Witkoff \u201cfollows all guidelines provided by Diplomatic Security and White House Information Technology.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe has had secure communications on his plane since the beginning,\u201d she added.",
      "Peace plan fallout",
      "Questions about the security of Witkoff\u2019s electronic communications were reinforced by the recent leak of a transcript of a phone call between him and Putin\u2019s foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov.",
      "In the October phone conversation, reported by Bloomberg, Witkoff offers advice about how to choreograph a conversation between Trump and Putin, suggesting they speak just before a scheduled visit to the White House by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "It\u2019s not clear who was behind the leak or how they got access to a phone call between Witkoff and Russian officials.",
      "In an interview with Russia\u2019s Kommersant newspaper late last month, Putin\u2019s aide, Ushakov, said that he regularly contacted Witkoff \u201cvia secure communication\u201d and via WhatsApp, a commercial application that experts say is vulnerable to hacking.",
      "The U.S. peace plan originally drawn up by Witkoff has been heavily revised after Rubio\u2019s intervention and a series of discussions with the Ukrainians. The most alarming provisions for Ukraine and European governments have been removed or altered, including prohibiting U.S. fighter jets from deploying to Poland or forcing a major reduction in the size of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces.",
      "Three weeks since Rubio and Witkoff flew to Geneva, the peace proposal remains under discussion, though Russia has sharply criticized the changes and demanded that negotiations return to the original plan shaped by Witkoff.",
      "Over the weekend, a U.S. delegation met with Ukrainian officials in Miami. \u201cThe American delegation included Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner, and White House staff member Josh Gruenbaum,\u201d Witkoff posted on social media Sunday.",
      "There was no mention of Rubio."

      "Beauty and fashion influencer Jaclyn Hill posed a question this month to her 1.2 million TikTok followers about something she said may be \u201ca little controversial\u201d: Why was she getting fewer views on her videos?",
      "\u201cWe are in such a weird place on social media as content creators where I am, like, fighting ... to connect with my followers,\u201d Hill said in the Dec. 3 video. \u201cWhen you have a million followers but you\u2019re getting 30,000 views, this is just not the way it used to be.\u201d",
      "Hill, 35 \u2014 whose luxury hauls and makeup tutorials on YouTube, Instagram and TikTok over the past 14 years have helped define influencer commerce culture \u2014 candidly asked her \u201cgirls\u201d for feedback, all while suggesting she was being \u201cpunished and penalized\u201d by the app for not posting constantly.",
      "Instead of support, followers slammed Hill for being \u201cout of touch.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re tired of watching influencers rub their wealth in our faces,\u201d a user commented. \u201cThe disconnect is crazy,\u201d another wrote.",
      "While Hill\u2019s video, which has amassed over 3 million views, took issue with fickle algorithms and shadow banning, it inadvertently sparked a broader conversation about whether the type of influencer content that cemented her career no longer resonates with Americans struggling with an unstable economy and rising grocery and housing costs.",
      "\u201cPeople are over the overconsumption,\u201d said Jessica Maddox, associate professor of media studies at the University of Georgia.",
      "Hill did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Product \u2018fatigue\u2019 and economic strains",
      "The conversation around influencer fatigue has been bubbling online for years as users pivot away from \u201cGet Ready With Me\u201d videos and lavish brand-trip vlogs and even away from \u201cde-influencing,\u201d a trend focused on not buying products or offering cheaper \u201cdupes\u201d to luxury items.",
      "\u201cDe-influencing\u201d became popular as a way to promote a more affordable way to stay on trend with influencers, but, Maddox said she\u2019s seeing a further fatigue with even the \u201cdupe\u201d route \u2014 people online just don\u2019t want to consume anymore.",
      "Maddox said brands have perfected the road map to commodify influencers, prompting haul videos and promotional content to become more polished and less like the \u201cgirl next door\u201d influencer videos that drew many users in.",
      "\u201cI think people miss the silliness,\u201d she said. \u201cI think people are over this need for perfection and constantly peddling products and luxury.\u201d",
      "One reason? Nostalgia for an older iteration of the internet.",
      "But the larger issue centers on the economy, particularly its negative state in 2025. While influencing has \u201cbecome a career with skill and with major economic impact,\u201d Maddox said, it\u2019s turning increasingly less relatable to those who consume the content, as evidenced by the dialogue between Hill and her viewers, as people struggle to make ends meet.",
      "\u201cThis has moved from \u2018Oh, I used to be able to relate to these influencers and creators because I thought they were authentic and I thought they were like me,\u2019 but now they\u2019re living these glamorous lifestyles that I personally can\u2019t afford, and everything feels so corporate and professional and almost, like, cold now as opposed to the warmth we used to see among creators and influencers,\u201d Maddox said.",
      "Hill\u2019s Dec. 3 video has amassed nearly 70,000 likes and 11,400 comments within weeks as users suggested it might be time for her to shift content gears and \u201cadjust to the current climate.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople aren\u2019t interested in watching someone spend thousands on a haul or decorate a million-dollar home for Thanksgiving,\u201d a user wrote.",
      "Another TikTok user even went so far as to make a reply video, pointing out that Hill\u2019s content showcasing her wealth is why her followers are no longer connecting with her videos.",
      "\u201cLook, Jaclyn, you\u2019re rich and you won, but I\u2019m sorry if people don\u2019t want to be drowned in overconsumption by influencers when they can\u2019t afford groceries or housing,\u201d TikTok user Daadi said in a video that has gotten 2.8 million views.",
      "And it\u2019s that stark juxtaposition between the haves and the have-nots in 2025 that aggravates the situation \u2014 and dictates online trends.",
      "\u201cWhen people are happy, when the economy is doing well, we like to \u2018elevate our stature\u2019 [by] hanging out with influencers, being a part of that culture,\u201d said Peter Shankman, social media and marketing expert, author and entrepreneur.",
      "\u201cBut when stuff starts to go down,\u201d he said, \u201cthe influencers are begging for the same thing as us, but it\u2019s not the same thing as us,\u201d because your average viewer is just trying to find the money to buy dinner.",
      "Looming consumer-driven social media shift",
      "For Maddox, the controversy surrounding Hill is a harbinger for social media content.",
      "\u201cI actually don\u2019t think at the end of the day any of this is about Jaclyn,\u201d Maddox said. \u201cPeople online do become these punching bags where it\u2019s almost not even about the content they\u2019re saying, but people kind of see the issues associated with the content\u201d \u2014 in this case, issues with influencer culture, finances and the economy.",
      "Hill took the comments in stride and the next day posted a follow-up video telling her followers that she had heard them: \u201cYou\u2019re sick of the \u2018influencer-era\u2019... sick of the luxury,\u201d she said.",
      "She then asked her followers what it is they want to see from her content.",
      "\u201cI started this 14 years ago when I was literally on food stamps, broke as hell. I had no clue that you could make a dime doing social media. I genuinely started it for the love of it,\u201d Hill said.",
      "\u201cThe only reason I\u2019m still here is for you guys, for the community. If you\u2019re not enjoying what you\u2019re seeing, I 100% want to know. I want to shift gears,\u201d she added.",
      "Maddox said she sees a shift in social media based on what consumers want to see, which she said includes relatability and ordinary people but also information and opportunities to learn something new. People miss the \u201cgirl next door\u201d influencer, she added.",
      "\u201cIt was not as perfect [or] commodified or TikTok wasn\u2019t constantly trying to sell you something,\u201d she said.",
      "Such is the plague of being a content creator in 2025: The bigger and more successful creators become, the more polished their content gets with the introduction of brand deals \u2014 even when audiences want something else.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like they want the next crop, the next class of influencers,\u201d so viewers can \u201cgo back to finding somebody with a smaller following, the relatable friend next door that they can plug into,\u201d Maddox said.",
      "She added: \u201cBut then the cycle is just going to repeat.\u201d"

      "\u201cA small-market team like us can come into Mile High and get it done,\u201d Jacksonville head coach Liam Coen said in his postgame news conference, referring to a perceived dig by Denver head coach Sean Payton in the lead-up to the game.",

During Jacksonville\u2019s six-game winning streak, Lawrence has accounted for 21 touchdowns (18 passing, three rushing) while throwing only four interceptions.",
      "In his last four games, Lawrence has a passer rating over 100 in each contest after having never reached that mark once in the first 11 games of the season.",
      "Against Denver, which entered the game fourth in yards allowed per game and third in points allowed, Lawrence completed 23 of 36 passes for 279 yards and three touchdowns. He also ran six times for 20 yards and another score.",
      "\u201cI feel great with our offense right now, what we\u2019re able to do, the passing game, guys are making plays, giving them opportunities down the field, and we\u2019re protecting well,\u201d Lawrence said after Sunday\u2019s win. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a lot of things well.

      "Lawrence and Coen have seemingly come a long way since early in the season, when they were seen arguing on the sidelines during a game in September after Coen was upset about a missed throw. Through 16 weeks, not only does Lawrence already have his most wins in a single season, but he\u2019s on pace for his most touchdowns in a year, as well.",
      "While the Jaguars will need some help to capture the top seed in the AFC, they do have a favorable schedule over the last two weeks of the season. Jacksonville will face the Philip Rivers-led Indianapolis Colts in Week 17 before they end the season at home against the 3-12 Tennessee Titans."

      "\u201cThat\u2019s just part of being a child life specialist, trying to celebrate our kids during really hard times and bringing these personalized moments to them,\u201d she says.",
      "Hospital staffers threw an all-day party for Henry, with Hinson's help \u2014 she bought cupcakes, special decorations and giant friendship bracelets to share with other young Swifties in the hospital.",
      "Swift's music played in his room throughout the day, and Henry called in staff members when their favorite songs came on. His doctors joined in, too, wearing their heart-shaped glasses and dancing. \u201cHe just had a really great day,\u201d Hinson says.",
      "It culminated in a performance of \u201cThe Life of Henry.\u201d Set to the backing track of the album\u2019s titular song, the team launched into their personalized lyrics celebrating everything that makes Henry special.",
      "\u201cWorking with him these last three weeks and getting to know who he is as Henry first, because he is Henry before a patient,\u201d Rodriguez explains. \u201cI just thought of all of his favorite things.\u201d",
      "Henry\u2019s reaction? \u201cI was in shock, like I cried and laughed,\u201d he tells TODAY.com. His favorite part of the song was \u201cwhen they talked about me liking Swig and 67.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know that they will ever understand the impact that that had on Henry, and on me,\u201d Hinson says. \u201cBecause they didn\u2019t just offer medical care that day. It wasn\u2019t just them doing their jobs. They saw Henry.\u201d",
      "The viral performance came during a particularly challenging time for Henry, who has undergone 25 surgeries related to his condition. The week before Thanksgiving, Henry was hospitalized after going into septic shock and required surgery and time on a ventilator as his body fought infection.",
      "\u201cHis bravery, in my opinion, is unmatched,\u201d Hinson says, her voice catching with emotion. \u201cHe faces a lot of really big, scary things.\u201d",
      "For Henry, Swift\u2019s music serves as more than entertainment, it\u2019s a lifeline during scary moments.",
      "\u201cWhen he is scared, when he has to go to the CT machine or he\u2019s going back into surgery, all somebody has to do is say, \u2018Well, tell me about the time you went to the Eras Tour,' and he\u2019s instantly transported into this place that\u2019s safe and secure and that he understands. It just makes his days inside of this hospital a little bit easier,\" she says.",
      "Henry now watches the video of the performance regularly, and his mom catches him humming his own personalized version of the song.",
      "She tells both her sons \u2014 Henry and his 15-year-old brother, Oliver\u2014 that \u201cjoy is a choice we make every day.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the hard times, it\u2019s especially important that we choose joy, that we look for joy, because it is what sustains us. And so for Henry, he oozes it. He literally oozes joy,\u201d she says.",
      "The viral attention has inspired Henry and his family to give back. When Hinson told Henry that the TikTok video was starting to earn money through the creator fund, \u201che didn\u2019t miss a beat and he said, \u2018Mom, I think we should donate it back to the hospital. You know, they\u2019re the reason we\u2019re getting it,\u2019\u201d she recalls.",
      "Both Henry and his brother Oliver asked their mom to create an Amazon wish list for the child life team at Riley instead of receiving gifts for themselves for the holidays this year.",
      "\u201cThey both were like, \u2018Mom, we have enough stuff,\u2019\u201d Hinson says. The public wish list includes items like Lip Smackers chapstick, which child life specialists use to coat the inside of anesthesia masks so kids smell strawberry or chocolate instead of a sterile operating room.",
      "\u201cChild life specialists often work with a very limited budget, but the work they do is so incredibly important,\u201d Hinson explains. \u201cI\u2019m just incredibly grateful that the internet gets to see the work that really goes into loving children through critical illness.\u201d"

      "Director James Cameron has in the past promised two more \u201cAvatar\u201d movies are yet to come.",
      "But in a new interview with The Hollywood Reporter published Dec. 17, Cameron said moving forward with the final two films, whose budgets would be as enormous as the first three movies, depends on the box-office success of \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis can be the last one. There\u2019s only one (unanswered question) in the story. We may find that the release of \u2018Avatar 3\u2019 proves how diminished the cinematic experience is these days, or we may find it proves the case that it\u2019s as strong as it ever was \u2014 but only for certain types of films,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a coin toss right now,\u201d added Cameron. \u201cWe won\u2019t know until the middle of January.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s what we know about the possible final two installments in the \u201cAvatar\u201d franchise.",
      "What Is the 'Avatar' Franchise About?",
      "The sci-fi franchise, created by Cameron, tells the story of a group of humans in the antagonistic Resources Development Administration (RDA) who clash with indigenous humanoid called the Na\u2019vi after greedily colonizing their moon Pandora to mine a valuable mineral.",
      "The franchise\u2019s long arc also features an unlikely love story between a human, Jake Sully, played by Worthington, and the Na\u2019vi warrior Neytiri, played by Salda\u00f1a.",
      "\u201cAvatar: The Way of Water\u201d introduces a new oceanic Na\u2019vi tribe, the Metkayina clan, who live on Pandora\u2019s reefs, as well as new sea creatures like the whale-like Tulkuns. In \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash,\u201d viewers get to meet the Mangkwan clan, also known as the Ash People, who are led by their wicked leader Varang, played by Oona Chaplin.",
      "When Will \u2018Avatar 4\u2019 Be Released?",
      "The year delay in the release of \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d pushed back the release dates of the franchise\u2019s final two movies, Deadline reported in June 2023.",
      "\u201cAvatar 4,\u201d which was originally scheduled for a December 2026 release, will now arrive in theaters in December 2029, according to Deadline.",
      "But, as Cameron told The Hollywood Reporter in an interview published this week, he hopes the just-released \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d is another box-office smash in order for him to continue with the franchise.",
      "Still, Cameron shared tidbits about the script of \u201cAvatar 4\u201d with Entertainment Weekly way back in 2022, revealing that the movie would feature \u201ca big time jump\u201d to accommodate how much the franchise\u2019s younger actors have aged in real life.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re young men, young women at that point, when we get to the B side of that time jump,\u201d he said.",
      "During a 2023 appearance on \u201cWho\u2019s Talking to Chris Wallace,\u201d Cameron confirmed he\u2019d already begun working on both final films.",
      "\u201c\u2018Avatar 4\u2019 and \u20185\u2019 are both written. We even have some of \u20184\u2019 in the can,\u201d said Cameron.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve begun a franchise at this point,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe can safely say we\u2019ve begun a saga that can now play out over multiple films, which was our original goal.\u201d",
      "When Wallace asked if Cameron already knew the final scene of the entire franchise, Cameron responded, \u201cOh yeah. It\u2019s all been written. The scripts for 2, 3, 4 and 5 were all finished over five years ago. It\u2019s all mapped out.\u201d",
      "When Will \u2018Avatar 5\u2019 Be Released?",
      "\u201cAvatar 5,\u201d which was originally intended to arrive in theaters in December 2028, is now set for a December 2031 release, reported Deadline.",
      "How Will the 'Avatar' Story End?",
      "As far as how the franchise\u2019s story will wrap up, producer Jon Landau dropped a bombshell about the plot of \u201cAvatar 5,\u201d during a 2022 conversation with Gizmodo\u2019s io9 blog.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to talk about it, but I\u2019ve now subsequently heard that Jim (Cameron) has talked about it a little bit,\u201d Landau said. \u201cIn movie five there is a section of the story where we go to Earth. And we go to it to open people\u2019s eyes, open Neytiri\u2019s eyes, to what exists on Earth.\u201d",
      "The journey, said Landau, will illustrate to the Na\u2019vi that the colonizing humans in the Resources Development Administration don\u2019t represent all humans.",
      "\u201cEarth is not just represented by the RDA,\u201d he said. \u201cJust like you\u2019re defined by the choices you make in life, not all humans are bad. Not all Na\u2019vi are good. And that\u2019s the case here on Earth. And we want to expose Neytiri to that.\u201d"

Alas, he learned that she wasn\u2019t meeting with anyone before or after the show in an effort to conserve her voice for the concert, which lasted over three hours.",

The Ash People come in handy when the big war rages.",

At one point, Spider is thrown into the middle of their fight. He slips and is at risk of falling to his death. Quaritch attempts to save him but also puts himself in danger \u2014 and Jake helps save them both. The encounter seems to draw them all to a truce.",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Tennessee's governor pardoned country star Jelly Roll on Thursday for his criminal past in the state, acknowledging the Nashville native's long road back from drugs and prison through soul-searching, songwriting and advocacy for second chances.",
      "The rapper-turned-singer whose legal name is Jason Deford has spoken for years about his redemption arc before diverse audiences, from people serving time in correctional centers to concert crowds and even in testimony before Congress.",
      "Republican Gov. Bill Lee issued the pardon after friends and civic leaders of the Grammy-nominated musician joined in an outpouring of support.",
      "Jelly Roll's convictions include robbery and drug felonies. He has said a pardon would make it easier for him to travel internationally for concert tours and to perform Christian missionary work without filling out burdensome paperwork.",
      "He was one of 33 people to receive pardons Thursday from Lee, who for years has issued clemency decisions around the Christmas season. Lee said Jelly Roll's application underwent the same monthslong thorough review as other applicants. The state parole board gave a nonbinding, unanimous recommendation for Jelly Roll's pardon in April.",
      "\"His story is remarkable, and it's a redemptive, powerful story, which is what you look for and what you hope for,\" Lee told reporters.",
      "Jelly Roll and Lee meet at the governor's mansion",
      "Lee said he never met Jelly Roll until Thursday, when the musician visited the governor's mansion over the pardon news. The two hugged in front of a lit Christmas tree and a fireplace decorated with holiday garlands.",
      "Unlike recent high-profile federal pardons, which let people off the hook for prison, a Tennessee pardon serves as a statement of forgiveness for someone who has already completed a prison sentence. Pardons offer a path to restoring certain civil rights such as the right to vote, although there are some legal limitations, and the governor can specify the terms.",
      "Jelly Roll broke into country music with the 2023 album \"Whitsitt Chapel\" and crossover songs like \"Need a Favor.\" He has won multiple CMT Awards, a CMA Award and also picked up seven career Grammy nominations.",
      "Much of his music deals with overcoming adversity, like the song \"Winning Streak\" about someone's first day sober. Or the direct-and-to-the-point, \"I Am Not Okay.\"",
      "\"When I first started doing this, I was just telling my story of my broken self,\" he told The Associated Press in an interview. \"By the time I got through it, I realized that my story was the story of many. So now I'm not telling my story anymore. I'm getting to pull it right from the crevices of the people whose story's never been told.\"",
      "Jelly Roll: 'I was a part of the problem'",
      "Before the parole board, Jelly Roll said he first fell in love with songwriting while in custody, calling music a therapeutic passion project that \"would end up changing my life in ways that I never dreamed imaginable.\"",
      "Outside of sold-out shows, he's testified before the U.S. Senate about the dangers of fentanyl, describing his drug-dealing younger self as \"the uneducated man in the kitchen playing chemist with drugs I knew absolutely nothing about.\"",
      "\"I was a part of the problem,\" he told lawmakers at the time. \"I am here now standing as a man that wants to be a part of the solution.\"",
      "Jelly Roll's most serious convictions include a robbery at 17 and drug charges at 23. In the first case, a female acquaintance helped Jelly Roll and two armed accomplices steal $350 from people in a home in 2002. Because the victims knew the female acquaintance, she and Jelly Roll were quickly arrested. Jelly Roll was unarmed, and was sentenced to one year in prison plus probation.",
      "In another run-in 2008, police found marijuana and crack cocaine in his car, leading to eight years of court-ordered supervision.",
      "Sheriff whose jail held Jelly Roll urged a pardon",
      "Friends and civic leaders cited his transformation in backing a pardon.",
      "Davidson County Sheriff Daron Hall, who runs Nashville's jail, wrote that Jelly Roll had an awakening in one of the jails he managed. Live Nation Entertainment CEO and President Michael Rapino cited Jelly Roll's donations from his performances to charities for at-risk youth.",
      "\"I think he has a chance and is in the process of rehabilitating a generation, and that's not just words,\" Hall said in a phone interview Thursday. \"I'm talking about what I see we need in our country, is people who accept responsibility, accept the fact that they make mistakes and accept the fact that they need help.\"",
      "The parole board began considering Jelly Roll's pardon application in October 2024, which marks the state's five-year timeline for eligibility after his sentence expired. Prominent Nashville attorney David Raybin represented Jelly Roll in the pardon case.",
      "Lee's office said no one was pardoned Thursday who had a homicide or a sex-related conviction, or for any crime committed as an adult against a minor."

      "Warning; Major spoilers ahead for the \u201cSurvivor\u201d Season 49 finale\u2026",
      "In a teaser for the \u201cSurvivor\u201d Season 49 finale, host Jeff Probst said, \u201cThis has been one of the most unpredictable games we have ever seen.\u201d But did the five remaining castaways deliver an epic ending to the season?",
      "When the three-hour Season 49 finale began on Wednesday, Dec. 17, there were five contestants hoping to win the title of \u201csole \u2018Survivor\u2019\u201d and the $1 million prize: Kristina Mills, Rizo Velovic, Sage Ahrens-Nichols, Savannah Louie and Sophi \"Soph\" Balerdi.",
      "The final five still had a couple Immunity Challenges, the controversial Fire-Making Challenge and Final Tribal Council to get through before the jury voted for a winner. Plus, the after show revealed which two castaways will return for the historic Season 50, arriving Wednesday, Feb. 25,  2026.",
      "Read on to find out everything that happened in the Season 49 finale, including who was crowned the winner, below.",
      "1st  Immunity Challenge",
      "After Soph found an advantage in the jungle to help her in the Immunity Challenge, she learned from Probst at the challenge that half of her puzzle pieces were already placed in the correct spots. But Soph instantly fell behind during the first portion of the challenge and struggled to crawl through the mud.",
      "Meanwhile, Savannah sped through nearly every portion and quickly completed the puzzle, giving her a record-tying fourth Immunity Challenge win and guaranteeing her a spot in the final four.  She also won the reward and chose to take Sage to the Sanctuary to enjoy steak and potatoes.",
      "In her confessional, Savannah smiled wide as she celebrated her win and pointed out how she has been able to outlast her foes all season long.",
      "1st Tribal Council",
      "Back at camp, Kristina \u2014 who assumed Savannah, Soph and Rizo would vote together given that they've been a strong trio for most of the game \u2014 pitched voting out Sage to Soph and Rizo. During the reward meal, Sage suggested to Savannah that the better move was to vote out Kristina since she could beat anyone in the Fire-Making Challenge. Thus, the Tres Leches alliance was at a stalemate going into Tribal Council.",
      "After a back-and-forth between Kristina and Sage at Tribal Council where they both explained why the other was a threat, it was time to vote. Rizo \u2014 who had been holding onto his Hidden Immunity Idol for a record nine Tribal Councils \u2014 finally played his idol for himself before the votes were read.",
      "Probst read the votes and revealed Kristina as the 14th person voted out and seventh member of the jury.",
      "2nd Immunity Challenge",
      "Following an interruption due to an address from President Trump, the show picked up at the second and final Immunity Challenge of the night.",
      "The final four were neck and neck as they reached the final portion of the challenge. Soph pulled out a comeback victory and received her first Immunity Challenge win of the season.",
      "\"Oh my God, this is a dream!\" she said when Probst placed the necklace around her neck.",
      "Fire-Making Challenge",
      "As the winner, Soph had to choose which person to take to the end with her and which two castaways had to face off in the Fire-Making Challenge. She told the other three that they should practice while she contemplated her decision, adding that she didn't want them to plead their cases.",
      "In a confessional, Savannah said she felt betrayed by her \"best friend\" Soph for not instantly wanting to save her. Rizo tried to remain optimistic and said he had more experience making fire compared to Savannah and Sage. Sage also had a positive mentality as she prepared, telling herself that whatever was meant to happen would happen.",
      "At Tribal Council, Probst said Soph's choice could be a $1 million decision. She announced that she wanted to take Sage to the final three and have her two allies, Savannah and Rizo, make fire to earn the last spot.",
      "While Rizo struggled and repeatedly smothered his fire, Savannah nurtured a strong fire that continued to grow until it burned through the rope, making her the winner.",
      "Rizo became the eighth and final member of the jury. Before leaving, Rizo shared some emotional departing words. \"For a little Albanian boy from New York City... to say I have no regrets, to say I made my family proud, to say I made a whole country proud, I truly feel like I left an impact on this game.\"",
      "He asked to be called by his nickname, \"Riz God,\" as Probst snuffed his torch.",
      "Final Tribal Council",
      "As their final breakfast arrived at camp, Savannah, Sage and Soph reflected on being the first all-female final three in 20 seasons. They also shared some of their favorite moments with each member of the jury.",
      "Next, it was time for Final Tribal Council to begin. Rizo kicked things off by sharing kind words for the three ladies. The remaining members of the jury then posed questions that allowed each finalist to elaborate on their strategies and how they outwitted, outlasted and outplayed everyone else.",
      "When asked to name her most strategic move, Soph said she built strong connections outside of her trio that helped her social game. Savannah recalled a conversation with jury member Sophie Segreti where she pitched working together. Sage mentioned her move to vote out Sophie over Savannah.",
      "For their final pitches, Soph noted that she had been to 12 Tribal Councils and voted out more people than anyone else. Savannah said she successfully dodged the most bullets because she was adaptable, prioritized key relationships and dominated in Immunity Challenges. Sage said she had an important social component to her game that worked hand in hand with her strategic game, allowing her to build close friendships.",
      "And the Winner Is\u2026",
      "\"The jury has made their decision. I'll read the votes,\" Probst said. After three votes were revealed, each woman had a vote each. But as he continued to read the votes, Savannah's name appeared again and again. Savannah was crowned the winner of Season 49.",
      "The cast all toasted with champagne as Probst kicked off the after show.",
      "After Show and Final \u2018Survivor\u2019 Season 50 Contestants Revealed",
      "During the after show, Savannah said she felt \"imposter syndrome\" the whole season and it was a \"larger than life feeling\" to win the game. \"I don't even know what to say because I've never experienced anything like this before. It's a crazy feeling,\" she added.",
      "In the final moments of the episode, Probst introduced the first trailer for \"Survivor\" Season 50. At the start of the clip, the host is shown speaking to all the returning players. He tells them he expects them all to give \"everything\" they have to win.",
      "The chaotic trailer also mentioned that Zac Brown, Billie Eilish, Jimmy Fallon and MrBeast will impact the game in some way.",
      "And with that, Season 49 is over and Season 50 is just a couple months away. See the complete Season 50 cast, below.",

      "A pair of deadly attacks this month, in Syria and Australia, has shone a fresh spotlight on the Islamic State, the militant group whose sudden rise to power in the Middle East and reign of terror throughout the world had appeared to crest, and then fall, during the 2010s.",
      "But for experts who study ISIS, law enforcement and intelligence officials who fight it and the growing number of victims who have been attacked or intimidated, the group has long been more down than out \u2013 a diminished threat, but a threat nonetheless.",
      "\u201cThey never went away,\u201d said Aaron Zelin, an expert on the group and a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cThe nature of the threat just changed and the nature of the way they organized themselves changed. But what\u2019s animated the Islamic State has never changed.\u201d",
      "Last weekend, a member of Syria\u2019s security forces shot dead three Americans -- two soldiers and an interpreter -- near the city of Palmyra. The Islamic State didn\u2019t claim responsibility for the attack, but the U.S. and Syrian governments both blamed the terrorist group.",

      "\u201cWe are striking very strongly against ISIS strongholds in Syria, a place soaked in blood which has many problems, but one that has a bright future if ISIS can be eradicated,\u201d President Donald Trump  said Friday in a post on Truth Social.",
      "In Sydney, two men opened fire on a Hanukkah gathering at  Bondi Beach on Sunday, killing at least 15 people. Both men were shot by police. One man died; the other, the man\u2019s son, survived and has been charged in the attack. Islamic State social media accounts traditionally linked to the group praised the attack but did not officially claim responsibility, referring to it  in an official publication as \"Sydney's pride.\" The two suspects were found with Islamic State flags and literature.",
      "While the two incidents were notable for their geographic spread, the identities of those killed and a perception that the Islamic State had faded from global headlines, experts say they were exceptions that belie a measurable metric: ISIS is getting weaker, and arrests and attacks have been declining globally.",
      "\u201cThere will always be some space for attacks here and there. But the trajectory is that ISIS is still on the decline,\u201d said Renad Mansour, a research fellow at Chatham House, a London-based foreign policy think tank. \u201cAnyone who has a grievance and finds a network can basically attack, and in many cases the central ISIS leaders don\u2019t know it happens until it happens, and then they claim it.\u201d",
      "The group has claimed 1,100 attacks so far in 2025, he said, down from a high of 3,460 in 2019.",
      "There have been 383 ISIS-related arrests worldwide so far in 2025, Zelin said, citing the Washington Institute\u2019s Islamic State Select Worldwide Activity Map, an initiative he leads. Reporting from police sources found 531 such arrests last year, Zelin said, the vast majority of which occurred in active war zones such as Iraq and Syria.",
      "One thing the recent attacks showcase is a strategy that has made the Islamic State effective in the past: its big-tent approach to operations and ideology that allow \u201clone-wolf\u201d actors to affiliate themselves with ISIS with almost no vetting or coordination.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re seeing more of and more of the hallmarks of ISIS-related activity that date back 10 years ago,\u201d Rebecca Weiner, Deputy Commissioner Intelligence and Counterterrorism at the New York Police Department, told NBC News. \u201cThe do-it-yourself model was professionalized and has been really deployed around the world by ISIS, inspiring dozens of people to carry out attacks in their name.\u201d",
      "The Islamic State emerged from the ferment of Syria\u2019s civil war in the early 2010s, when Syria\u2019s porous borders and surfeit of Islamist fighters offered fertile recruiting ground for all manner of jihadi groups. But ISIS  distinguished itself by forming a self-governing state encompassing parts of Syria and Iraq that promised a return to the political expansionism of early Islam.",
      "Though defeated, that \u201ccaliphate\u201d has remained a central part of the Islamic State\u2019s message, even as the group has shifted its focus more toward terrorism than nation-building.",
      "The two suspects in the Bondi Beach shooting are known to have visited the Philippines before the attack. If investigators find that the two men underwent ISIS commando training in southern Mindanao island, that could point to a level of centralized coordination that investigators haven\u2019t seen from ISIS in years.",
      "The group\u2019s activities over the past year have also shown an enduring, if dampened, public appeal.",
      "On Tuesday, Polish authorities said they had arrested a teenager who they said had sought contact with the group and whom they suspected of planning an attack on a Christmas market.",
      "In Michigan in October, two men were charged with plotting a mass shooting over Halloween weekend.",
      "And almost a year ago, an ISIS-inspired American Muslim killed 14 people by driving a truck into New Year\u2019s revelers in New Orleans.",
      "The Islamic State has still been unable to reconstitute its so-called caliphate, a vast Islamist emirate the group ruled across parts of Iraq and Syria until it was finally destroyed in 2019. In both countries, Islamic State attacks reached historic lows in the past year.",
      "Where the group has made strides and managed to constitute some territory is in the Sahel region of northwest sub-Saharan Africa \u2014 countries like Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger.",
      "The Islamic State\u2019s presence in the remote, arid and sparsely populated parts of Africa may still feel more like merely surviving than thriving to the group\u2019s members and potential recruits.",
      "\u201cEven though they\u2019re active in several African countries, it doesn\u2019t have the same kind of ideological reverence because there is so much history in the Arab world related to Islam,\u201d said Zelin.",
      "And while the Sydney terror attack was lethally successful, many of the Islamic State\u2019s attacks have been thwarted by law enforcement as multinational counterterrorism sharing has grown far stronger.",
      "While observers have said it\u2019s too early to say the recent attacks amount to a resurgence of the group, two relatively recent changes could help revive its fortunes. The fall of Bashar al Assad\u2019s regime in Syria a year ago revived the country\u2019s chaos, offering a wider opening for Islamic State.",
      "When Syrian President Ahmed Al Sharaa \u2014 himself a former Islamist militant who once led a like-minded Al Qaeda offshoot group \u2014 joined the U.S.-led Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS last month, it painted a target on the Syrian government\u2019s back.",
      "Even before that, an Islamic State-claimed attack on a church in Damascus that killed at least 25 people in June once again jolted Syrian authorities\u2019 attention to Islamic State\u2019s threat.",
      "Meanwhile, the group\u2019s messaging has exploited Israel\u2019s highly lethal war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip as a rallying cry for attacks against the West. Palestinian health officials say over 70,000 people have been killed in the war.",
      "\u201cI think the temperature has been turned up by the conflict in Gaza over the past two years,\u201d said Colin P. Clarke, the executive director of the Soufan Center, a New York-based security think tank. \u201cIt\u2019s brought in a larger swath of people who are now kind of consuming information that leads them pretty quickly through social media algorithms to extreme content.\u201d",
      "As much of the world gathers for the end-of-year religious holidays,  Islamic State commandos \u2014 whether self-annointed or directed by its leadership \u2014 are taking notice as well.",
      "The group has targeted religious festivities in the past, and analysts warned that another spectacular assault against Christian, Jewish or Muslim targets could give the Islamic State the publicity boost it needs for a more deadly and influential 2026.",
      "\u201cThese are big times when they might try to do stuff,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cIf they can do stuff again quickly, that would be monumental for them, because they haven\u2019t been able to do stuff like that in years.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Decades before this week\u2019s manhunt through New England ended with the discovery of his body in a storage facility, Claudio Manuel Neves Valente had been an academic powerhouse in his home country of Portugal. Enrolled at one of the country\u2019s most prestigious engineering schools, Neves Valente graduated at the top of his class, seemingly poised for a bright future.",
      "Now, Neves Valente is dead at age 48, suspected of committing two shocking acts of violence \u2014 and authorities in both the United States and Portugal are looking for a motive that could explain his actions.",
      "Officials believe Neves Valente was behind a mass shooting that killed two students and injured nine other people on Saturday at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. He is also suspected of fatally shooting 47-year-old Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Nuno Loureiro at Loureiro\u2019s home in the Boston suburb of Brookline on Monday.",
      "The shootings gripped residents of Rhode Island and Massachusetts as days passed without anyone in custody. Then on Thursday, authorities announced they had closed in on a storage unit in Salem, New Hampshire, where they found Neves Valente\u2019s body, who appeared to have died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.",
      "Little is known about how he chose his targets, though Neves Valente has past connections to Brown and to Loureiro.",
      "A Providence police affidavit says that Neves Valente came to the U.S. to attend Brown University from August 2000 to spring 2001 on a student visa in the physics Ph.D. program. He requested a leave of absence from the school in 2001, and ultimately withdrew in 2003, the affidavit said.",
      "Neves Valente did not obtain a degree during his time there, Brown\u2019s president said in an email, and he did not have a current affiliation with the university. The email said that during his three semesters at Brown, Neves Valente most likely would have spent time in Barus & Holley, the building where Saturday\u2019s massacre occurred.",
      "Scott Watson told NBC News that he attended Brown with Neves Valente and had been his only friend there. He said Neves Valente was socially awkward and would often complain about Brown.",
      "\u201cHe would say the classes were too easy \u2014 honestly, for him they were,\u201d Watson wrote in an email. \u201cHe already knew most of the material and was genuinely impressive.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe could be kind and gentle, though he often became frustrated \u2014 sometimes angry \u2014 about courses, professors, and living conditions,\u201d Watson wrote.",
      "Watson recalled a conflict that Neves Valente had with another student whom he said Neves Valente would refer to as a \"slave\" because the student was from Brazil.",
      "\"I had to break up a fight once,\" he wrote.",
      "Prior to that time, both Neves Valente and Loureiro, the MIT professor, attended the Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico in Lisbon, according to the school, which said that they were enrolled from 1995 to 2000 in the undergraduate program in technological physics engineering. Rog\u00e9rio Cola\u00e7o, the president of Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, told the Portuguese newspaper Expresso that Neves Valente graduated with a final average grade of 19 out of 20 \u2014 an exceptionally high score, particularly given how rigorous the university is.",
      "Even before starting college, Neves Valente had made a strong impression academically. He represented Portugal at the 1995 International Physics Olympiad for secondary school students, in Canberra, Australia, a news clip from the science publication Gazeta da F\u00edsica shows.",
      "Yet Neves Valente seemed to have left little imprint on those he studied with.",
      "\u201cMost classmates have no memory of Cl\u00e1udio Valente, other than the fact that he was the top student in the program that year,\u201d Cola\u00e7o told Expresso.",
      "Loureiro, meanwhile, was a researcher at the Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico's plasmas and nuclear fusion unit and was described in a statement from the school as a \"brilliant colleague.\"",
      "\"His friends and colleagues at IPFN and at T\u00e9cnico, some of whom continued to collaborate with Nuno to this day, are deeply distressed by his premature passing,\" the statement said. \"We remember a brilliant colleague, with whom it was a scientific and personal pleasure to collaborate.\"",
      "Alex Schekochihin, a longtime friend and colleague of Loureiro's, said in an email that it was difficult to find anyone who did not like Loureiro.",
      "\"He was a fantastic physicist, a very effective leader with a clear vision and sophisticated sense of strategy, and an amazing human being,\" he wrote.",
      "What Neves Valente accomplished personally or professionally after graduation is not as clear.",
      "Loureiro was a widely known figure \"to anyone who follows the field,\u201d said Carlos Fiolhais, a professor emeritus of physics at the University of Coimbra. \"Valente was a physicist by training, not a researcher, with no known published articles. ... This is aberrant. It is deeply disturbing for the scientific community.\u201d",
      "The Providence police affidavit said that Neves Valente obtained legal permanent resident status in 2017. Public records show he lived in Las Vegas that year and, more recently, appeared to reside in Miami. He had rented a hotel room in Boston twice in late November, an FBI agent wrote in a separate affidavit.",
      "A tipster on the chat forum Reddit led authorities to track down Neves Valente after the shootings. The Portuguese Criminal Police, Portugal\u2019s investigative force, said it was cooperating with U.S. authorities in the investigation.",
      "The Brown University students killed in Saturday\u2019s attack were identified as Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov and Ella Cook. Umurzokov, from Uzbekistan, was remembered by his aunt as kind and smart; Cook, from Birmingham, Alabama, had been the vice president of Brown\u2019s college Republicans group and was described by her church as an \u201cincredible, grounded, faithful, bright light.\u201d",
      "Loureiro had been a world-renowned plasma physicist and fusion scientist who joined MIT in 2016. In a video posted to YouTube earlier this year, Loureiro spoke about his work and offered advice to students in his field.",
      "\u201cI think on any given day, it\u2019s tempting to go for the low-hanging fruit,\u201d he said. \u201cBe a little more ambitious and tackle the really hard problems.\u201d"

      "The attack \u2014 Australia\u2019s worst mass shooting in nearly three decades \u2014 killed 15 people during a seaside Hanukkah celebration and was designated a terrorist attack targeting the Jewish community. One suspect was killed during the attack, while the other was injured and charged with terrorism and murder after he awoke from a coma, as Australian investigators probe their alleged connection to the Islamic State terrorist group.",
      "A minute of silence was observed at 6:47 p.m. local time (2:47 a.m. E.T.) Sunday, exactly seven days since the attack began. A candle projection lit up Sydney Opera House, while crowds of mourners attended an evening memorial at Bondi, guarded by a heavy police presence, including snipers on rooftops and police boats in the waters.",
      "David Ossip, the president of the New South Wales Jewish Board of Deputies, told the crowd: \"Like the grass here at Bondi was stained with blood, so, too, has our nation been stained. We have landed up in a dark place.\"",

      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was at the memorial, as was Governor-General Sam Mostyn, King Charles' representative in Australia. Former Australian Prime Minister John Howard was photographed embracing mourners in the crowd.",
      "The shooting has left Australians across the country reeling, with tributes accompanied by a reckoning over the government\u2019s response to growing antisemitism and the availability of guns in the country.",
      "Albanese was booed as he arrived Sunday night. Leaders in Australia\u2019s Jewish community and some of the victims\u2019 families have blamed the Australian government for missing the signs of growing antisemitism in the wake of the war between Hamas and Israel that erupted in the aftermath of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on an Israeli music festival and accused it of not doing enough to protect the country\u2019s Jewish community.",

      "Naveed Akram, 24, the surviving suspect, was charged with 59 offenses Wednesday, including terrorism and 15 counts of murder, after he awoke from a coma in a Sydney hospital, having been shot by police. He is alleged to have carried out the attack alongside his father, Sajid Akram, 50.",

      "LONDON \u2014 Authorities in Britain and Australia are tightening restrictions on pro-Palestinians protests in response to the Islamic State-inspired Bondi Beach massacre targeting a Jewish gathering that killed 15 people.",
      "In New South Wales, the Australian state where the deadly attack on a Hanukkah celebration took place, police will be granted expanded powers to shut down unauthorized protests, while tougher hate speech laws will be introduced, including a proposed ban on the slogan \u201cglobalize the intifada.\u201d",
      "The move comes shortly after U.K. police arrested two people in London on racially aggravated public order charges for allegedly shouting slogans invoking \u201cintifada\u201d at a pro-Palestinian demonstration. The new restrictions are part of a nationwide policing shift in response to the attack, which has drawn concern from some civil liberties and free-speech advocates.",
      "The Arabic word \"intifada\" is generally translated as \"uprising\" and is used to describe two major Palestinian uprisings in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip against Israeli occupation, the first beginning in 1987 and the second in 2000, both characterized by periods of violence as well as nonviolent mass protests.",
      "Supporters say the term \u201cglobalize the intifada,\u201d which has been used for years at pro-Palestinian protests worldwide, refers to international solidarity against Israeli occupation.",
      "Israeli officials and some Jewish organizations, however, argue the term carries an inherent call to violence against Israel and that it functions as antisemitic incitement, a dispute that has increasingly led to policing decisions.",
      "NSW Premier Chris Minns said Thursday that the \u201cimplications\u201d of pro-Palestinian rallies could be seen in the Bondi attack and, after authorities designated the shooting a terrorist event, he has introduced reforms that would give his government powers to shut down unauthorized protests for three months.",
      "\u201cWhen you see people marching and showing violent bloody images, images of death and destruction, it\u2019s unleashing something in our community that the organizers of the protest can\u2019t contain,\u201d he said.",
      "Minns on Saturday announced further reforms to hate speech laws that would ban the \"globalize the intifada\" chant alongside other \u201chateful comments and statements,\u201d as well as \u201cterrorist symbols such as the ISIS flags.\u201d",
      "In the United Kingdom, London Metropolitan Police and Greater Manchester Police said Wednesday officers would arrest people holding placards and chanting the phrase \u201cglobalize the intifada,\u201d directly citing the context of the attack. A rabbi and a Holocaust survivor were among those killed in the Sydney terror attack, which officials said was intended to directly target the Jewish community.",
      "In a joint statement after the attack, London and Manchester's law enforcement agencies said: \u201cViolent acts have taken place, the context has changed \u2014 words have meaning and consequence. We will act decisively and make arrests.\u201d",
      "The British police forces also referenced an attack at a synagogue in Manchester earlier this year, where two people were killed on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar.",
      "Hundreds of people, many of them elderly, according to British Home Office data, have already been arrested at protests in recent months across the U.K. for showing support for Palestine Action, a group that was banned under British terrorism laws after staging actions targeting military facilities and defense firms. The British government said, without providing evidence, that the group had shown willingness \"to use violence in pursuit of its cause.\"",
      "While major Jewish groups have welcomed last week's changes and proposals in the U.K. and Australia, some analysts and opponents of the new measures warn that governments are responding to security fears by collapsing political speech into criminal conduct.",
      "Index on Censorship, a U.K.-based organization advocating for free expression, said police and prosecutors will need to demonstrate that the words \u201cglobalize the intifada\u201d are \u201charmful in and of themselves.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhere meaning is genuinely ambiguous, we always argue that the criminal law should tread carefully,\u201d it said in a statement Friday.",
      "Marji Mansfield, 69, a retired financial consultant and grandmother of seven, was carried away in handcuffs by police officers at demonstrations in July and November in London, and faces terrorism charges for expressing support for Palestine Action.",
      "She said she hasn't heard 'globalize the intifada' chanted at rallies, but denied the slogan was an incitement to violence, calling it \"a call for liberation\" amid Israel's ongoing occupation of Gaza.",
      "\"It seems bizarre that our government and the government in Australia are seeking to criminalize words that are saying, 'stop these illegal international crimes against humanity',\" she told NBC News.",
      "The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker T\u00fcrk, warned in July that some measures in the U.K. limiting pro-Palestinian protests appear \"at odds with the U.K.\u2019s obligations under international human rights law.\"",
      "Freedom of expression \u201chas always been vital, but it\u2019s never been absolute,\" said Mark Stephens, co-chair of the International Bar Association\u2019s Human Rights Institute. \"We've always drawn a line at incitement to violence, and so that principle has to adapt in more volatile climates.\"",
      "The difficulty authorities face, Stephens told NBC News, is that they are taking slogans and criminalizing them \"on the grounds that it threatens public safety and the state has a duty to act, but that is an area where reasonable people can and do differ.\"",
      "From a police perspective \"it's becoming a bit of a game of Whac-A-Mole,\" he added. \"If you can't say 'globalize the intifada,' someone will come up with something else which isn't illegal, and that becomes the new phrase du jour.\"",
      "In Australia, the additional legislation on protests has also sparked debate over how far authorities should go in policing political expression.",
      "\u201cFor two years, people have paraded in our streets and universities calling for the intifada to be globalized, a catchphrase which means kill Jews wherever you find them,\" David Ossip, the president of the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies, said last week.",
      "Some Jewish groups have opposed the move. The Jewish Council of Australia, a progressive group that advocates for \"Palestinian freedom,\" said Thursday in a statement that \"policy which points towards universities, the protest movement and migration as the problem will only lead to more demonization.\"",
      "Australian authorities charged the surviving suspect in the Bondi Beach shooting with 59 offenses on Wednesday, including terrorism and 15 counts of murder.",
      "Naveed Akram, 24, was charged after he awoke from a coma in a Sydney hospital, having been shot by police. He is alleged to have carried out the attack alongside his father, Sajid Akram, 50."

Both were members of the Iowa National Guard. Ayad Mansoor Sakat, of Macomb, Michigan, a U.S. civilian working as an interpreter, was also killed.",
      "The shooting that took place near the historic city of Palmyra also wounded three U.S. personnel and members of Syria\u2019s security forces, before the gunman was killed. The assailant had joined Syria\u2019s internal security forces as a base security guard two months ago and recently was reassigned because of suspicions that he might be affiliated with ISIS, Interior Ministry spokesperson Nour al-Din al-Baba has said."

      "President Donald Trump said Thursday that he is leaving the possibility of a war with Venezuela on the table.",
      "\"I don\u2019t rule it out, no,\" he told NBC News in a phone interview.",
      "Trump on Tuesday ordered a \"blockade\" of sanctioned oil tankers coming and going from Venezuela, increasing pressure on the country's president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. The U.S. recently seized an oil tanker captured near Venezuela, as well.",
      "The administration\u2019s campaign has already resulted in 28 boat strikes that have killed more than 100 people, including a \u201cdouble tap\u201d strike facing congressional scrutiny.",
      "In his phone interview, Trump said \"I don't discuss it\" when he is asked whether he rules out the possibility that such actions could lead to war.",
      "But when he was pressed, he confirmed it was a possibility and said there will be additional seizures of oil tankers. Asked for a timeline, Trump replied: \"It depends. If they\u2019re foolish enough to be sailing along, they\u2019ll be sailing along back into one of our harbors.\"",
      "Trump also declined to say whether ousting Maduro was his ultimate goal.",
      "\"He knows exactly what I want,\" Trump replied. \"He knows better than anybody.\"",
      "Trump's admission that he's not ruling out a war with Venezuela is significant. He has long tried to distinguish himself from the hawkish wing of the Republican Party, and in 2024, he campaigned on being able to keep the U.S. out of foreign conflicts.",
      "In his speech after he won the election, Trump said he was \"not going to start a war; I\u2019m going to stop wars.\"",
      "The administration has claimed that the strikes have been on alleged drug boats and that Venezuela is using oil revenue to finance \"drug terrorism.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Trump sought to defend his economic policies in a national prime-time address as voters continue to indicate that they're struggling with the cost of living.",
      "In the speech, Trump announced a $1,776 \u201cwarrior dividend\u201d that will go to nearly 1.5 million members of the military in honor of the nation\u2019s founding almost 250 years ago.",

      "A senior administration official said the one-time bonus for troops will cost about $2.6 billion and be paid drawing from military housing funds from the One Big Beautiful Bill. The legislation, which Trump signed in July, allocated $2.9 billion to reduce the out-of-pocket cost for service members for two years.",
      "A Senate appropriations source also said that the money will come from there, not tariffs, and that the Defense Department decided instead to give the money as a one-time payment instead of creating a precedent for housing costs down the line.",
      "Trump also touched on health care in his remarks Wednesday night, blasting \"gigantic health insurance companies that have gotten rich on billions of dollars of money that should go directly to the people.\"",
      "He said people should be able to \"buy their own health insurance, which will give far better benefits at much lower cost. It will be far better health insurance.\"",
      "Millions of people who get coverage through the Affordable Care Act are set to see their health insurance premiums skyrocket next year, after House Republicans refused to call a vote this week to extend the subsidies.",
      "Trump said he doesn't believe it's necessary to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.",
      "\"I don\u2019t have to do anything, because Obamacare would just repeal itself automatically because nobody\u2019s going to want to use it. Too expensive,\" he told NBC News.",
      "He also said he has no plans to announce a broader health care plan.",
      "\"As far as I\u2019m concerned, I rolled it out last night,\" he said. \"It\u2019s very simple. It\u2019s a very simple plan. The insurance companies have become totally rich and beyond any comprehension. They get billions and billions of dollars a year, and we\u2019re not going to let that happen.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to pay the money directly to the people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can use health care accounts. They can use \u2014 you know, there are many ways of doing it, but we\u2019re going to let them buy their own health care. They\u2019ll get much better health care at a much lower price.\"",
      "A central focus for both parties next year will be November's midterm elections, with the Republicans cognizant that losing control of either chamber of Congress could lead to investigations and headaches for the White House.",

      "For the second year in a row, North Korea\u2019s vast cryptocurrency hacking operation has broken its own record, stealing $2.02 billion in 2025, new research says.",
      "A report published Thursday by the blockchain watchdog company Chainalysis found that North Korea broke its own record of $1.3 billion in hacked and stolen crypto like bitcoin and ethereum. That brings the country\u2019s total stolen crypto to around $6.75 billion, the report said. The total amount of stolen crypto around the globe rose to $3.4 billion.",
      "A significant chunk of that comes from the hack of the Dubai-based cryptocurrency exchange Bybit this year. The hackers \u2014 who worked for North Korea\u2019s elite government hacking squad, according to the U.S. Secret Service \u2014 stole around $1.5 billion, mostly in ethereum, in February, Bybit\u2019s CEO said.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to stop, because there\u2019s an asymmetry where they\u2019re in general so cut off from the world and such a rogue state,\u201d said Matt Pearl, the director of the Strategic Technologies Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a national security think tank.",
      "Part of the theft is most likely due to the increasingly common phenomenon of North Korean hackers\u2019 fraudulently obtaining remote technical jobs with international companies, the report said. That access can put them in positions to give their hacker colleagues a foothold to steal cryptocurrency keys and wire crypto to Pyongyang.",
      "There are scattered incidents of other countries\u2019 professional hackers\u2019 stealing large amounts of money. The Secret Service previously linked Chinese government hackers to an operation that stole U.S. Covid relief benefits, and the U.S. and U.K. governments have accused some financially motivated Russian cybercriminals of ties to the Kremlin.",
      "But no country has an alleged operation like North Korea\u2019s, whose hackers working directly for the government routinely steal such large sums from companies around the world.",
      "Leaked documents have previously shown that North Korea has deployed some of the most sophisticated international money laundering operations on the planet.",
      "Crypto is also generally much easier to launder at a large scale than traditional currency. Exchanges often hold it in vast sums, making them extremely ripe targets for North Korea.",
      "Cryptocurrencies are stored in wallets, or accounts that can be accessed with private keys, and it remains the case that if hackers gain control of an account, they can quickly wire it to a different wallet that they own. Unlike with traditional finance, there are few ways to reverse a fraudulent transaction.",
      "\u201cDespite their institutional resources and professional security teams, these platforms remain vulnerable because of this fundamental security challenge,\u201d the Chainalysis report found.",

      "New satellite imagery shows damage to a Russian naval base after Kyiv said it had taken out a submarine with an underwater drone, in what it celebrated as a historic first.",
      "Moscow denied any damage from the strike, which could mark a significant new development in Ukraine\u2019s prolific drone program \u2014 and its campaign to show it can still inflict serious pain on the Kremlin\u2019s war effort.",
      "Colorado-based firm Vantor, which released the satellite images Tuesday, said they revealed damage to the port of Novorossiysk on the Black Sea coast.",
      "Russia moved much of its Black Sea fleet to the port to try and shield it from Ukrainian attacks, which had frequently hit its primary base in Sevastopol, on the annexed Crimean Peninsula.",
      "\"A section of a quay in the port has been damaged by the attack and one Kilo-class submarine is positioned nearby. It is unclear if that specific submarine was damaged in the attack; moreover, three additional Kilo submarines are also observed in the port. A series of floating barriers remain positioned at the entrance to the naval base,\" Vantor said."

      "Australian authorities charged the surviving suspect in the Bondi Beach shooting with 59 offenses Wednesday, including terrorism and 15 counts of murder.",
      "Naveed Akram, 24, was charged after he awoke from a coma in a Sydney hospital, having been shot by police. He is alleged to have carried out an Islamic State-inspired attack on the Hanukkah celebration alongside his father, Sajid Akram, 50.",
      "The charges came as the first funerals for the victims were held under tight security, not far from the scene of the massacre. Investigators were, meanwhile, turning their attention to the suspects' alleged ISIS connection, including a trip to a southern island of the Philippines \u2014 seen in the past as a hot spot for extremism.",
      "Akram was also charged with 40 counts of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to murder and one count each of committing a terrorist act, discharging firearms, placing explosives and publicly displaying a terrorist organization symbol, New South Wales police said."
