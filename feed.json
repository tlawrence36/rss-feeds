    "published": "Sun, 05 Jan 2025 00:26:25 -0500",

      "After a rocky few years and the disbanding of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the Golden Globes have seemingly stabilized",
      "After a rocky few years and the disbanding of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the Golden Globes have seemingly stabilized. Now the question is: Can they still put on a good show?",
      "The 82nd Golden Globes, beginning Sunday night at 8 p.m. EST, will hope to rekindle some of the frothy comic energy of the days when Ricky Gervais or Tina Fey and Amy Poehler hosted. Last year's comeback edition, hosted by Jo Koy, was widely panned, but it delivered where it counted: Ratings rebounded to about 10 million viewers, according to Nielsen. CBS signed up for five more years.",
      "This time, comedian Nikki Glaser will be emceeing the ceremony from the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California. The Globes, now owned by Todd Boehly's Eldridge Industries and Dick Clark Productions, will be broadcast live by CBS and available to stream live for subscribers to Paramount+ with Showtime beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern.",
      "While Glaser doesn't have as widely seen contenders as last year, when \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and \u201cBarbie\u201d were the headliners, the show does promise about as much star power as Hollywood can muster. Nominees including Zendaya, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Angelina Jolie, Daniel Craig, Denzel Washington, Ariana Grande, Cynthia Erivo and Selena Gomez.",
      "Jacques Audiard's Netflix musical \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d comes in as the lead nominee, with 10 nods, followed by Brady Corbet's postwar epic \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d with seven, and Edward Berger's papal thriller \u201cConclave,\u201d with six. Among the top-nominated series are \u201cThe Bear,\u201d \u201cShogun\" and \u201cOnly Murders in the Building.\u201d",
      "Here are a few things to look for heading into Sunday's Globes:",
      "The best actor in a drama category is a bruiser, with a field of Ralph Fiennes (\"Conclave\"), Adrien Brody (\"The Brutalist\"), Daniel Craig (\"Queer\"), Colman Domingo (\"Sing Sing\"), Sebastian Stan (\"The Apprentice\") and Chalamet, for the Bob Dylan film \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d While Fiennes or Brody might take it, a win for Chalamet would be the first major award for the 29-year-old star \u2014 and surely would get the Oscar talk going.",
      "Just days before the Globes, Blake Lively sued \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d director Justin Baldoni and several others tied to the romantic drama, alleging harassment and a coordinated campaign to attack her reputation for coming forward about her treatment on the set. Baldoni, who has denied it, joined in a suit accusing The New York Times for libel in its story on her allegations.",
      "Whether or not any of this gets mentioned on the Beverly Hilton Ballroom stage, it will surely be on the minds of many attendees. Among the nominees for box-office achievement is \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d which star and was co-produced by Ryan Reynolds, Lively's husband. Glaser, whose sharply barbed jokes at a roast of Tom Brady helped catapult her to this moment, isn't known for biting her tongue.",
      "\u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d may have be favored over \u201cWicked\u201d for the best comedy or musical award, but Jon M. Chu\u2019s theatrical hit is also in the mix for the Globes\u2019 nascent cinematic box office achievement award. Either, or both, of the leading ladies of \u201dWicked\u201d could also win: Erivo in the leading actress category, and Grande in supporting.",
      "The Globes, taking place about two weeks before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, could get very political if presenters and winners are so inclined to continue what's been a mutually antagonistic relationship between Hollywood and Trump. That may be unlikely, though; so far in Hollywood's awards season, most nominees have tried to stay out of the fray.",
      "That's with a major exception, though, in \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d the young Trump drama starring Sebastian Stan and Jeremy Strong. Both were nominated by the Globes. Stan was also nominated a second time for his performance in \u201cA Different Man.\u201d",
      "It's been an unusually uncertain awards season so far in many respects. No one movie has really stepped forward as the leading best picture contender, though several films \u2014 including \u201cConclave,\u201d \u201cAnora,\u201d \u201cWicked,\" \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d and \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d \u2014 can all make a decent case. The Globes don't typically do much to sort out the field, but a strong showing from any of the above could add fuel to their Oscar campaign.",

      "\u201cI was always drawn to left-of-center things,\u201d he told Jim Alexander two years ago in an interview for the Reel Talker YouTube channel.",
      "Baena said in the same interview that it was \u201camazing\u201d to work with Plaza, who appeared in four of his five films. The 40-year-old actor and producer rose to fame playing April Ludgate on the television series \u201cParks and Recreation\u201d and was nominated for an Emmy for her role on \u201cThe White Lotus.\u201d The couple married in 2021.",
      "\u201cThe opportunities to create together, to do something creative where we're both fulfilled, it's like how rare is that? She's down and she's so talented, so I'm really lucky,\" Baena said.",
      "A representative for Plaza said that in addition to Plaza, Baena is survived by his mother, Barbara Stern, stepfather Roger Stern, father Scott Baena, stepmother Michele Baena, brother Brad Baena and stepsiblings Bianca Gabay and Jed Fluxman."

Past recipients include Norman Lear, Ryan Murphy and Ellen DeGeneres. The first was Burnett herself.",

      "The show\u2019s title is a homage to \u201cThey Call It Pro Football,\u201d which was NFL Films\u2019 first full-length film in 1967. NFL Films originated in Philadelphia and founders Ed and Steve Sabol are in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. It also featured the voice of John Facenda, whose tone was imitated on the show by Kelce and his panel as they narrated modern NFL highlights.",
      "\u201cI knew I wanted NFL Films because I felt like we wanted to make a show that celebrated the NFL landscape,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cNot just from current players and current games, but of past games and past players. Past announcers. NFL fans and the subculture of the NFL. We wanted to create a show that really embraced all of that.\u201d",
      "The Philadelphia-based band Snacktime provided the music. Kylie Kelce, fresh off dethroning Joe Rogan as the No. 1 podcast on the Spotify charts, served as the foul-mouthed sidekick from her perch in \u201cKylie\u2019s Korner.\u201d",
      "Kelce's expletives in the monologue were no momentary brain cramp as he transitioned from locker room talk to cable television. Kelce and his wife peppered their conversations with profanity \u2014 this is late night, after all \u2014 and tried to make the relationship seem as real in the studio as it is at home, where the couple raise three daughters, with a fourth expected this year.",
      "\u201cWe really wanted the language to be real and authentic to me,\u201d Kelce said after the show. \u201cWe overdid it a little bit today to kind of prep the audience on what to expect. I think the F-bombs was the one thing where I was told, we might want to be a little bit cautious there but, listen, we want to give you range to be who you are.\"",
      "The debut one-hour \u201cLate Night\u201d episode was taped Friday in front of a live audience from Philly concert venue Union Transfer. The show aired at 1 a.m. EST on ESPN and will tape the next four Friday nights. The schedule coincides with the last week of the NFL\u2019s regular season and the playoffs.",
      "Comedian Seth Herzog warmed up the crowd and joked the event had a no-phones policy so Kelce wouldn\u2019t smash them like he did in a viral moment at Penn State.",
      "The Philly slant couldn\u2019t be missed \u2014 they filmed a bit where a female fan spewed bites of a hoagie into the mouth of, well, Jason Kelce from the future, and Barkley played to the crowd when he picked the Eagles to win the Super Bowl \u2014 but the real Kelce said he wanted a show that would appeal to fans nationwide.",
      "Smash hit or not, there are no promises from ESPN of anything beyond the limited run.",
      "\u201cWe really just wanted to try something fun to do and I think everybody was on board to experiment and see what happens,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cI do think there's room for this, especially within the football season.\u201d",
      "After Kelce participated in a skit with parents Ed and Donna, celebrated with a fastest beer-chugging winner and shared a cold one at the bar with Eagles great Harold Carmichael, he broke down the show the same way he would as an Eagles player in the postgame locker room.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s game day,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cPlenty of errors, just like a game. Plenty of things to clean up. But just so happy with how it went.\u201d",

      "It\u2019s vastly different to work as an Asian actor in North American hubs such as Toronto, Los Angeles and New York \u2014 than in those in Asia, including Hong Kong and Taipei",
      "Twenty years after he was a young, struggling actor in Toronto, Thomas Lo is now the one giving young Asian actors their big breaks. He just had to go to Hong Kong to do it.",
      "The Chinese Canadian has been the creative director of one of the island city's biggest TV broadcasting companies for only a few years, but is already making original English-language content to reach viewers around the world.",
      "\u201cIt was a bit of a full-circle moment for me,\u201d Lo told The Associated Press. \u201cYou see more Asians but you\u2019re still seeing the same Asians on screen, right? We\u2019re looking for more opportunities on a grander scale and it\u2019s not just in front of the camera. It\u2019s behind the camera as well.\u201d",
      "It's vastly different to work as an Asian actor in North American hubs \u2014 Toronto, Los Angeles, New York \u2014 than in those in Asia \u2014 such as Hong Kong or Taipei. Actors in Asia don't as often have to deal with auditioning for stereotypical characters, being the only Asian on a set or getting tokenized. Historically, many Asian American and Canadian actors have even relocated from the West to countries in Asia to find better opportunities in entertainment.",
      "A few film and TV producers on both sides of the Pacific, however, are looking to shake up those dynamics by crisscrossing their show biz ecosystems. The hope is a win-win with fledgling talent in the Asian diaspora gaining global exposure \u2014 and Asia-based productions getting wider audiences. For example the Hulu series \u201cShogun,\u201d which won 18 Emmys, demonstrated a successful collaboration between Japanese and Western cast and crew \u2014 which included Japanese Americans.",
      "At the helm of Hong Kong's Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB), Lo led its first collaboration with an American company \u2014 on an original TV drama with scenes in both English and Cantonese. Two crews on two different continents filmed \u201cCross My Mind,\u201d a series about a Chinese American aspiring music producer in Los Angeles (Nathan Ing) who becomes telepathically connected to a Hong Kong advertising executive (Cantopop singer Jocelyn Chan).",
      "Chan, 30, was born in Hong Kong but spent ages 3-11 in Vancouver, British Columbia. She returned to Hong Kong for her music career partly because of concern about succeeding in North America.",
      "\u201cA lot of people probably had similar sentiments to me where it's more possible if we came back to this home,\u201d Chan said of finding success in the entertainment industry in Asia. \u201cWe all feel like we have two homes.\u201d",
      "Her role in \u201cCross My Mind\u201d is powerful, assertive and far from Western stereotypes of Asian women as meek.",
      "The partnership between Los Angeles-based Wong Fu Productions and TVB started with one side sliding into the other's DMs on Instagram.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019d be cool if we can kind of tap into their audience of what they built because that\u2019s who we\u2019re trying to speak with,\u201d Lo said, about reaching Asian American viewers.",
      "Wong Fu, which started in 2003, is now a thriving YouTube channel of Asian American-centered skits and other content. Simu Liu was among its then-emerging actors.",
      "\u201cNow we have actors that want to work with us for free and are just like \u2018Put us in whatever,\u2019 knowing that it\u2019s a way to connect with Asian Americans first,\u201d said Wesley Chan, Wong Fu co-founder and creative director. \u201cThen that can also be a way to propel them.\u201d",
      "Wesley Chan, no relation to Jocelyn, was intrigued by the challenge of shepherding a story that incorporates Asian and Asian American protagonists. He and his team wrote six episodes of \u201cCross My Mind\u201d in six months to film in 2022.",
      "\u201cWe knew that they wanted to make a story that could kind of show the cultural differences between an American and someone in Hong Kong,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought that was really cool because to even know that there is a difference \u2014 or to share that there\u2019s a difference \u2014 I think is a nuance that is not seen very often.\u201d",
      "Meshing work styles was no small feat. Wesley Chan noticed crews in Los Angeles and Hong Kong \u2014 where there are no unions \u2014 worked differently. It in some ways paralleled the bicultural nature of the show itself.",
      "The show premiered in April 2023 on myTV Super, TVB's streaming platform that has 9 million subscribers. It debuted the following December in the U.S. on two new streaming platforms that have since merged into GoldenTV, which focuses on English language content for Asian American viewers.",
      "\u201cThere's two different audiences on both sides of the world, but it\u2019s still content that I think has eyeballs,\u201d said Takashi Cheng, GoldenTV's founder. \u201cThe fact that they need English-language programming tells you that American or English content is not dead. It\u2019s in fact very much attractive in foreign countries.\u201d",
      "GoldenTV has gained thousands of subscribers since launching nearly two years ago, Cheng said. The platform plans to grow with unscripted shows. In September, it premiered entertainment news show \"The Takeaway,\u201d hosted by influencer Michelle Park. Actor Daniel Wu (\"American Born Chinese\") is developing a docuseries on his love of racing.",
      "Wu, 50, rose to fame after moving to Hong Kong. Someone like Wu \u2014 who was born in the San Francisco Bay Area, became a Hong Kong cinema star and then pivoted to Hollywood \u2014 is a \u201crarity,\" Lo said. Before digital audiences, it was difficult to alternate between Asian and American screens, he continued.",
      "\u201cI think we were a breath of fresh air for those actors and talents and artists, when we said that we\u2019re going to be producing English content,\u201d Lo said. \u201cThere is an audience that\u2019s untapped here.\u201d",
      "Wesley Chan said Wong Fu is not ruling out being \u201ca conduit\u201d for more crossover collaborations.",
      "Jocelyn Chan is still maintaining her singing career with hit singles and a solo Hong Kong concert this year. But she says the success of \u201cCross My Mind,\u201d has given her the courage to think about acting beyond Hong Kong. She\u2019s now looking for an agent in Canada.",
      "\u201cIt kind of pushed me to not wait,\u201d said Chan, who is also a sound healer and practitioner. She also thinks there's more space for talent who grew up bicultural. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like an even more niche representation within the wider Asian representation.\u201d"

      "Movie ticket sales are taking a bit of a hit in 2024",
      "Movie ticket sales took a bit of a hit in 2024. The annual domestic box office is expected to end up at around $8.75 billion, down more than 3% from 2023, according to estimates from Comscore.",
      "It\u2019s not as dire as it was in the pandemic years, but it\u2019s also not even close to the pre-pandemic norm when the annual box office regularly surpassed $11 billion.",
      "This is the year the business felt the effects of the Hollywood strikes of 2023, the labor standoff that delayed productions and releases and led to a depleted calendar for exhibitors and moviegoers. And yet it\u2019s not as bad as it could have been, or at least as bad as analysts projected at the start of the year.",
      "\u201cThis has been a really incredible comeback story for the industry,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cJust a couple of months ago it was a question of whether we would even hit $8 billion for the year.\u201d",
      "Hollywood continues to learn lessons about what moviegoers really want, what works and what doesn\u2019t. Here are the biggest takeaways from 2024.",
      "The Hollywood strikes might have ended in 2023, putting productions back into full swing and sending stars out on the promotional circuit again \u2014 but the ripple effect of the work stoppages and contract standoffs showed their real effects on the 2024 release calendar.",
      "The first two quarters were hit hardest, with tentpoles pushed later in the year (\u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d for one) or even into 2025 (like \u201cMission: Impossible 8\u201d). With no Marvel movie kicking off the summer moviegoing season, the box office was down a devastating 27.5% from 2023 right before \u201cInside Out 2\u201d opened in June.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an unpredictable business but it thrives on stability,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cWhen the release calendar is thrown off, the momentum stops.\u201d",
      "Sequels and franchises dominated the top 10 movies of the year, as has often been the case in the past 15 years. But this year, films carrying a PG rating did especially well, starting with the biggest movie of 2024: \u201cInside Out 2,\" which also became the biggest animated movie of all time, not accounting for inflation.",
      "Family films with a PG rating \u2014 including \u201cDespicable Me 4,\u201d\u201cMoana 2,\u201d\u201cWicked,\u201d \u201cKung Fu Panda 4,\u201d \u201cSonic the Hedgehog 3,\u201d \u201cMufasa\u201d and \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d \u2014 grossed over $2.9 billion this year, accounting for around 33% of the annual box office, according to Comscore. Movies rated PG-13, by contrast, made up about 30% of ticket sales.",
      "After a quieter 2023 and several years without a film at the very top of the charts, the Walt Disney Co. came back roaring in 2024 with three of the top five movies of the year: \"Inside Out 2,\u201d \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d and \u201cMoana 2.\u201d In mid-December, it crossed the $2 billion domestic mark, the second time any studio has done so since 2019 (that was also Disney, in 2022). Its 20th Century division also played an important part with \u201cAlien: Romulus\u201d and \u201cKingdom of the Planet of the Apes.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a different industry when Disney commits to theatrical releases,\u201d said Daniel Loria, an executive at the movie data and analytics trade The Boxoffice Company.",
      "Every year has high-profile flops and disappointments, and this was no exception. Sony had a rough go with its \u201cSpider-Man\u201d adjacent titles like \u201cMadame Web\u201d and \u201cKraven the Hunter\u201d (but this also seems to be the fate lately for anyone not named \u201cDeadpool\u201d). Universal had higher hopes for \u201cThe Fall Guy,\u201d as did Warner Bros. for \u201cFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga\u201d and \u201cJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux.\u201d",
      "Then there were the filmmaker-driven (and financed) passion projects that failed to take off like Kevin Costner\u2019s \u201cHorizon: An American Saga \u2014 Chapter 1\u201d and Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s \u201cMegalopolis.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a reductive way of thinking about those passion projects,\u201d Loria said. \u201cThose movies didn\u2019t come out with huge expectations, meaning theaters didn\u2019t clear out the house and give them three auditoriums per site in hopes for money to come in.\u201d",
      "This was, however, part of the problem with \u201cJoker 2,\u201d which was expected to be more in line with the first which made over $1 billion. But even that has a caveat, Loria thinks.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just that \u2018Joker\u2019 didn\u2019t perform, it\u2019s that there was nothing coming in behind it to make up that momentum,\u201d Loria said. \u201cThat\u2019s more the fault of a release schedule where one movie is supposed to carry a month. That model doesn\u2019t work anymore.\u201d",
      "What does work, Loria said, is a diverse lineup, with the Thanksgiving and Christmas successes being the perfect example. At Thanksgiving, there was \u201cWicked,\u201d \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cMoana 2.\u201d Christmas had \u201cMufasa,\u201d \u201cSonic 3,\u201d and a lot of adult offerings too, including \u201cNosferatu,\u201d \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d and \u201cBabygirl.\u201d",
      "Horror is often the safest bet for theatrical, but this year had even veterans pleasantly surprised by just how enthusiastic that audience can be, with hits like \u201cLonglegs,\u201d \u201cNosferatu,\u201d \u201cTerrifier 3\u201d and \u201cSmile 2\u201d getting people out of the house.",
      "The Blake Lively drama \u201cIt Ends With Us,\" which had its share of ongoing off-screen drama as well, also became an event. Audiences turned out for smart thrillers, like \u201cConclave\u201d as well as unexpected originals including \u201cAnora,\" \u201cThe Substance\u201d and \u201cThe Brutalist.\u201d",
      "Re-releases of movies in theaters that are also widely available in the home thrived this year. Some of the biggest successes included Christopher Nolan's \u201cInterstellar,\"\u201cCoraline\u201d and \u201cThe Phantom Menace.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt just shows our industry once again that audiences truly understand the difference between a communal, big screen theatrical experience that they crave even on films that they\u2019ve had the opportunities to see in the home,\u201d Nolan said in December. \u201cThat theatrical experience that we all know and love is so powerful and so exciting. It\u2019s a very clear demonstration of it.\"",
      "As silly as it sounds, this is the year the novelty popcorn bucket became a star. It started with the accidentally suggestive \u201cDune: Part 2\u201d creation, which \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d latched onto in a less accidental way. More recently, the \u201cNosferatu\u201d coffin buckets have been fetching high resale prices.",
      "For Loria, it\u2019s all part of a trend that theaters have been noticing since reopening during the pandemic: Moviegoers aren\u2019t back in pre-pandemic numbers, but those who did come back were spending more on concessions and premium tickets (like IMAX and other large format screens) than ever before.",
      "Everyone is optimistic for the film business in 2025, and the offerings for moviegoers \u2014 which include at least 110 films projected to open on over 2,000 screens \u2014 according to the National Association of Theatre Owners. And the momentum is there.",
      "\u201cThere's been a huge amount of box office generated in the last six weeks of the year,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cThis is the best opening act 2025 could have.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Actor Blake Lively has sued the director of the film \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d alleging harassment on the set and a coordinated campaign to smear her reputation",
      "Actor Blake Lively sued \"It Ends With Us\u201d director Justin Baldoni and several others tied to the romantic drama on Tuesday, alleging harassment and a coordinated campaign to attack her reputation for coming forward about her treatment on the set.",
      "The federal lawsuit was filed in New York just hours after Baldoni and many of the other defendants in Lively's suit sued The New York Times for libel for its story on her allegations, saying the newspaper and the star were the ones conducting a coordinated smear campaign.",
      "The lawsuits are major developments in a story emerging from the surprise hit film that has already made major waves in Hollywood and led to discussions of the treatment of female actors both on sets and in media.",
      "Lively's suit said that Baldoni, the film's production company Wayfarer Studios and others engaged in \u201ca carefully crafted, coordinated, and resourced retaliatory scheme to silence her, and others, from speaking out.\u201d",
      "She accuses Baldoni and the studio of embarking on a \u201cmulti-tiered plan\u201d to damage her reputation following a meeting in which she and her husband, actor Ryan Reynolds, addressed \u201crepeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior\u201d by Baldoni and a producer Jamey Heath, who is also named in both lawsuits.",
      "The plan, the suit said, included a proposal to plant theories on online message boards, engineer a social media campaign and place news stories critical of Lively.",
      "The alleged mistreatment on set included comments from Baldoni on the bodies of Lively and other women on the set. And the suit says Baldoni and Heath \u201cdiscussed their personal sexual experiences and previous porn addiction, and tried to pressure Ms. Lively to reveal details about her intimate life.\u201d",
      "Baldoni's attorney Bryan Freedman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Lively's lawsuit. But he previously called the same allegations \u201ccompletely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious.\u201d",
      "Lively's lawsuit comes the same day as the libel lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by Baldoni and others against the Times seeking at least $250 million. The Times stood by its reporting and said it plans to \u201cvigorously defend\u201d against the lawsuit.",
      "Others who are defendants in Lively's suit and plaintiffs in the libel suit include Wayfarer and crisis communications expert Melissa Nathan, whose text message was quoted in the headline of the Dec. 21 Times story: \u201c\u2018We Can Bury Anyone\u2019: Inside a Hollywood Smear Machine.\u201d",
      "Written by Megan Twohey, Mike McIntire and Julie Tate, the story was published just after Lively filed a legal complaint with the California Civil Rights Department, a predecessor to her new lawsuit.",
      "The libel lawsuit says the newspaper \u201crelied almost entirely on Lively\u2019s unverified and self-serving narrative, lifting it nearly verbatim while disregarding an abundance of evidence that contradicted her claims and exposed her true motives. But the Times did not care.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Times, Danielle Rhoades, said in a statement that \u201cour story was meticulously and responsibly reported.\"",
      "\u201cIt was based on a review of thousands of pages of original documents, including the text messages and emails that we quote accurately and at length in the article. To date, Wayfarer Studios, Mr. Baldoni, the other subjects of the article and their representatives have not pointed to a single error,\" the statement said.",
      "But Baldoni's lawsuit says that \u201cIf the Times truly reviewed the thousands of private communications it claimed to have obtained, its reporters would have seen incontrovertible evidence that it was Lively, not Plaintiffs, who engaged in a calculated smear campaign.\u201d",
      "Lively is not a defendant in the libel lawsuit. Her lawyers said in a statement that \u201cNothing in this lawsuit changes anything about the claims advanced in Ms. Lively\u2019s California Civil Rights Department Complaint, nor her federal complaint, filed earlier today.\"",
      "The romantic drama \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d an adaptation of Colleen Hoover\u2019s bestselling 2016 novel, was released in August, exceeding box office expectations with a $50 million debut. But the movie\u2019s release was shrouded by speculation over discord between Lively and Baldoni. Baldoni took a backseat in promoting the film while Lively took centerstage along with Reynolds, who was on the press circuit for \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d at the same time.",
      "Lively came to fame through the 2005 film \u201cThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,\u201d and bolstered her stardom on the TV series \u201cGossip Girl\u201d from 2007 to 2012. She has since starred in films including \u201cThe Town\u201d and \u201cThe Shallows.\u201d",
      "Baldoni starred in the TV comedy \u201cJane the Virgin,\u201d directed the 2019 film \u201cFive Feet Apart\u201d and wrote \u201cMan Enough,\u201d a book pushing back against traditional notions of masculinity. He responded to concerns that \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d romanticized domestic violence, telling the AP at the time that critics were \u201cabsolutely entitled to that opinion.\u201d",
      "He was dropped by his agency, WME, immediately after Lively filed her complaint and the Times published its story. The agency represents both Lively and Reynolds.",
      "Baldoni's attorney, Freedman, said in a statement on the libel suit that \u201cthe New York Times cowered to the wants and whims of two powerful \u2018untouchable\u2019 Hollywood elites.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn doing so, they pre-determined the outcome of their story, and aided and abetted their own devastating PR smear campaign designed to revitalize Lively\u2019s self-induced floundering public image and counter the organic groundswell of criticism amongst the online public,\" he added. \"The irony is rich.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The cheese-loving English inventor Wallace and his loyal dog Gromit are coming back to the small screen",
      "The cheese-loving English inventor Wallace and his loyal dog Gromit have been stars since the beginning.",
      "In the 35 years since Nick Park introduced the world to his stop-motion creations and their eccentric, unapologetically British existence, they\u2019ve won Oscars, appeared in commercials, video games, animated series and even the occasional bit of (unofficial) protest art. Feature films, however, have been few and far between. Part of the reason is the difficulty: Even a 30-minute short can take upward of two years. Besides, why mess with a formula that\u2019s produced only classics?",
      "After working on the pair\u2019s first feature, \u201cWallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,\u201d which was released in 2005 and won an Oscar, and \u201cEarly Man,\u201d Park even doubted that he\u2019d dabble in the form again. But sometimes inspiration requires a little more breathing room: That's how the second \u201cWallace & Gromit\u201d feature film, \u201cVengeance Most Fowl,\u201d came to be. It debuts on Netflix worldwide, except in the U.K., on Friday.",
      "Gnomes have always been part of Wallace and Gromit\u2019s world. After \u201cThe Curse of the Were-Rabbit,\u201d Park started kicking around an idea about a smart gnome, Norbot, built to help Gromit in the garden.",
      "\u201cThere was something a bit missing,\u201d Park said. \u201cWe tinkered around with the story on and off for years and it seemed to be lacking the more sinister element that\u2019s often in \u2018Wallace & Gromit.\u2019 Why do the gnomes go wrong? Who was the motivated villain?\u201d",
      "Five years ago, the solution came to them: Feathers McGraw, the conniving penguin with a penchant for heists and simple disguises, who turned their lives to chaos in \u201cThe Wrong Trousers.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was the answer to everything,\u201d Park said. \u201cThe story got bigger and more exciting. Suddenly it became a feature-length film.\u201d",
      "Over the years, Park and his co-director Merlin Crossingham often heard fan requests to bring Feathers back.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019d been very noncommittal about it because characters haven\u2019t in the past come back,\u201d Crossingham said. \u201cBut when we did drop a little teaser trailer, we were completely bowled over by the response. At that point, we were still making the film and it kind of gave us a boost and that confidence that it was the right thing to do.\u201d",
      "They needed it too since Feathers McGraw, like a true diva, was by far the most difficult puppet to animate, direct and light \u2014 this in a movie that has chase sequences, special effects and an army of evil gnomes. The simplicity of his design, and the fact that he doesn\u2019t speak, gave them no room to hide. In fact, in their world-class group of animators at Aardman, Park said only five volunteered to work on Feathers.",
      "\u201cAll the filmmaking tricks have to come together very well to make Feathers have that screen presence that we needed from him,\u201d Crossingham said.",
      "Part of the charm of the \u201cWallace & Gromit\u201d films is their unabashed Britishness, which the filmmakers have had to fight (politely) to preserve as their audience has become more and more global. While Netflix was largely supportive, they did have a bit of a back and forth over the turn of phrase \u201cFlippin\u2019 Nora!\u201d (They ultimately kept it.)",
      "\u201cA lot of the stuff in the films is inspired by stuff we grew up with, the design of things, little products,\u201d Park said.",
      "He was particularly happy to include a \u201chigh-speed\u201d barge chase on the canals and a joke about police at the Yorkshire border \u2014 melding uniquely British references with big Hollywood movie tropes.",
      "\u201cI think all of it is a sort of a lovely homage to Britishness and not in a patriotic way, just kind of laughing at ourselves culturally,\u201d Crossingham said.",
      "The starting point for all scenes was always the traditional: In camera, stop-motion animation like they\u2019ve been using since 1989. It is, Crossingham said, fundamentally vital to the films to see the thumbprints on the characters and know that they're handmade.",
      "There have always been limitations, and the option to use more digital assistance, but it\u2019s only been in recent years that computer graphics have caught up enough to blend in. Effects like fog and steam are possible in stop-motion, but, they explained, they never look quite right.",
      "\u201cThe main thing we required was that if we were going to use a digital technique, could we force it to look right for our film rather than it just being bolted on and feeling like an accessory that was a bit of an unwelcome guest,\u201d Crossingham said. \u201cThe visual effects department at Aardman worked very hard to get that stylizing so that it felt right in \u2018Wallace and Gromit,\u2019 in which and the sets and the props are characters in themselves.\u201d",
      "The tension between embracing technological innovation like artificial intelligence and preserving the old ways that still work was not just something they were thinking about off-camera. It\u2019s at the heart of the film too, as Wallace\u2019s well-intentioned invention turns against him (and wreaks havoc on the town).",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a bit meta,\u201d Crossingham said. \u201cI think there\u2019s something that resonates with audiences with stop-motion that they can tell it\u2019s handcrafted, they can tell that\u2019s the human touch.\u201d",
      "Park said he used to worry about the future of stop-motion, wondering how much time they had left. Recently, though, he\u2019s seen a resurgence.",
      "\u201cAs long as we\u2019re telling good stories, entertaining and compelling stories with compelling characters, we\u2019ll keep going,\u201d he said.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have reached a divorce settlement, her lawyer said Monday, bringing an apparent end to one of the longest and most contentious divorces in Hollywood history.",
      "Jolie's attorney James Simon confirmed to The Associated Press that the couple had come to a deal. News of the settlement was first reported by People magazine.",
      "\u201cMore than eight years ago, Angelina filed for divorce from Mr. Pitt,\u201d Simon said in a statement. \u201cShe and the children left all of the properties they had shared with Mr. Pitt, and since that time she has focused on finding peace and healing for their family. This is just one part of a long ongoing process that started eight years ago. Frankly, Angelina is exhausted, but she is relieved this one part is over.\u201d",
      "No court documents have been filed yet, and a judge will need to sign off on the agreement. An email late Monday night to Pitt's attorney seeking comment was not immediately answered.",
      "Jolie, 49, and Pitt, 61, were among Hollywood\u2019s most prominent couples for 12 years. The two Oscar winners have six children together.",
      "Jolie filed for divorce in 2016, after a private jet flight from Europe during which she said Pitt was abusive toward her and their children. A judge in 2019 declared them divorced and single, but the splitting of assets and child custody needed to be separately settled.",
      "A private judge that the two had hired to handle the case reached a decision soon after that included equal custody of their children, but Jolie filed to have him removed from the case over an unreported conflict of interest. An appeals court agreed, the judge was removed, and the couple had to start over.",
      "No details of the agreement were immediately revealed, and the couple's use of the private judge \u2014 an increasingly common move among splitting celebrities in recent years \u2014 has kept the proceedings largely under wraps. Some details, however, have been revealed through a separate lawsuit filed by Pitt, in which he alleged Jolie reneged on an agreement that she would sell him her half of a French winery the two owned together. It's not clear how the divorce agreement will affect that lawsuit."

      "Brazilian-made dramas rarely last long in local cinemas",
      "SAO PAULO -- Brazilian-made dramas rarely last long in local cinemas. But, nearly two months after its release, \u201cI\u2019m Still Here,\u201d a film about a family torn apart by the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for more than two decades, has drawn millions of moviegoers across the South American country.",
      "The film's domestic box office success \u2014 with nearly 3 million tickets sold, it secured the fifth spot at the 2024 box office by mid December \u2014 is rooted in its exploration of a long-neglected national trauma, but it is particularly timely, especially as Brazil confronts a recent near-miss with democratic rupture.",
      "Set in the 1970s and based on true events, \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d tells the story of the Paivas, an upper-class family in Rio de Janeiro shattered by the dictatorship. Rubens Paiva, a former leftist congressman, was taken into custody by the military in 1971 and was never seen again. The narrative centers on his wife, Eunice Paiva, and her lifelong pursuit of justice.",
      "The film was nominated for a Golden Globe for best foreign language film and shortlisted for the Oscars in the same category.",
      "\u201cComedies and other topics are more likely to become mega-successes, but this (the dictatorship) is a very taboo subject for us,\u201d said Brazilian psychoanalyst and writer Vera Iaconelli, adding that she felt a \u201csense of urgency\u201d after watching the movie last month, even though the dictatorship ended almost four decades ago.",
      "As the movie was being shown across Brazil, the Federal Police unsealed a report detailing a 2022 plot by military officers to stage a coup to prevent President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva from taking office, and to keep far-right former army captain Jair Bolsonaro in power. Bolsonaro and his allies have denied any involvement in participating or inciting a coup.",
      "\u201cEven if (director) Walter Salles wanted to plan the timing of the release this precisely, he wouldn\u2019t have gotten it so right,\u201d said Lucas Pedretti, a historian and sociologist whose works address memory and reparations after the military dictatorship.",
      "\u201cThe film plays a very important role in telling us: \u2018Look, this is what would happen if the coup that was planned by Bolsonaro and his military officers had succeeded.\u2019\u201d",
      "Unlike countries like Argentina and Chile, which established truth commissions and prosecuted former dictators and their henchmen, Brazil's transition back to democracy was marked by a sweeping amnesty to military officials.",
      "For years, said Pedretti, Brazil\u2019s military promoted the notion that government silence was the best way to bury the past.",
      "It was not until 2011 that Brazil\u2019s then- President Dilma Rousseff \u2014 a former guerrilla who was tortured during the dictatorship \u2014 established a national truth commission to investigate its abuses.",
      "The commission's 2014 report detailed harrowing accounts of torture and named perpetrators of human rights violations \u2014 none were ever imprisoned. But just as a reckoning of the dictatorship began, calls for a return to military rule emerged in street protests against corruption revelations.",
      "It was then that Marcelo Rubens Paiva, one of Rubens' sons, decided to share his family's story in his 2015 book \u201cI'm Still Here.\" The book introduced Eunice Paiva to a larger audience, chronicling her journey from a housewife to a relentless advocate for her disappeared husband, and how she raised five children by herself, while also pursuing a law degree.",
      "In the years that followed, far-right, anti-establishment forces increasingly gained traction. Bolsonaro \u2014 who has long celebrated the coup and praised dictatorship-era torturers \u2014 would go on to ride that wave to a presidential victory in 2018.",
      "Observing the surge of the far-right in Brazil, filmmaker Salles realized the country's memory of its dictatorship was very fragile. He said he saw a need for his country to confront its trauma in order to prevent history from repeating itself.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d isn\u2019t the first Brazilian movie to explore the memory of the dictatorship, but it is the most popular. Unlike other films on the subject that tend to focus on dissidents and armed resistance, Salles chose to frame his as a family drama and how the disappearance of the family patriarch upended their day-to-day lives.",
      "Its climax \u2014 spoiler alert! \u2014 arrives 25 years after Rubens\u2019 disappearance, when Eunice finally receives his death certificate.",
      "In December, a month after the film\u2019s premiere, the Brazilian government allowed families of dictatorship-era victims to obtain reissued death certificates acknowledging state-sponsored killings.",
      "\"It is very symbolic that this is happening amid the international repercussion of \u2018I\u2019m Still Here\u2019 ... so younger people can understand a bit of what that period was like,\u201d Brazil's Human Rights Minister Maca\u00e9 Evaristo said during the announcement, calling it an important step in the \u201chealing process for Brazilian society.\u201d",
      "The healing process remains incomplete, as some forces \u2014 once again \u2014 seek to prevent those who allegedly sought to sabotage democracy from being held to account.",
      "On Nov. 29, Bolsonaro urged Lula and the Supreme Court to grant amnesty for those involved in the 2022 alleged coup plot and, alongside his allies, pushed for legislation to pardon participants in the 2023 anti-democratic riot that aimed to oust Lula and marked an echo of the Capitol insurrection in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe coup is still here. It\u2019s still in people\u2019s minds, it\u2019s still in the minds of the military,\u201d said Paulo Sergio Almeida, a filmmaker and founder of Filme B, a company that tracks Brazil's national cinema. \u201cWe thought this was a thing of the past, but it\u2019s not. The past is still present in Brazil.\u201d",
      "This time around, many Brazilians are calling for the prosecution of those responsible for the attempted coup, believing that justice is essential for national reconciliation and future progress.",
      "On Dec. 14, police arrested Bolsonaro's 2022 running mate and former defense minister in connection with investigations into the alleged coup plot, becoming the first four-star general arrested by civilians since the end of the dictatorship in 1985.",
      "\u201cIt's a sign that we are making progress as a constitutional democracy,\u201d leftist Sen. Randolfe Rodrigues wrote on X that day. \u201cBrazil still has a long way to go as a Republic, but today is a HISTORIC day on this journey.\u201d",
      "Brazilians have also embraced the \u201cNo amnesty!\" rallying cry, which originated at street protests in the aftermath of the capital's 2023 riot and can still be heard.",
      "Earlier this month, a Supreme Court justice cited \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d while arguing that the 1979 amnesty law shouldn\u2019t apply to the crime of concealing bodies.",
      "\u201cThe disappearance of Rubens Paiva, whose body was never found or buried, highlights the enduring pain of thousands of families,\u201d Justice Fl\u00e1vio Dino said.",
      "Striking a chord in Brazil was precisely Marcelo Rubens Paiva's intent when adapting his book into a film.",
      "\u201cThe movie is sparking this debate, and it arrived at the right moment for people to recognize that living under a dictatorship is no longer acceptable,\u201d he said.",
      "On a recent evening in Sao Paulo, 46-year-old Juliana Patr\u00edcia and her 16-year-old daughter, Ana J\u00falia, left a movie theater in tears, touched by \u201cI\u2019m Still Here.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe saw all the suffering that Eunice endured, with Rubens being killed and taken from his family in such a brutal way,\u201d Patr\u00edcia said. \u201cIt made us even more certain that democracy needs to be respected and that, as Brazilians, we must fight harder to ensure that this never happens in our country again.\u201d",

      "Winter weather brings various hazards that people have to contend with to keep warm and safe",
      "HOUSTON -- HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 Winter weather brings various hazards that people have to contend with to keep warm and safe.",
      "These dangers can include carbon monoxide poisoning, hypothermia and frozen pipes that can burst and make homes unlivable.",
      "Public safety officials and experts say there are multiple ways people can prepare themselves to avoid these winter weather hazards and keep themselves safe.",
      "The hazards are on the radar this week because millions of people in the United States are set to be hit with moderate to heavy snow from Kansas City to Washington. Cold conditions are also gripping the East Coast.",
      "Officials say that during a winter storm, people should stay indoors. But home heating systems running for hours can increase the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning as the deadly fumes can be produced by furnaces, stoves and heaters, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Carbon monoxide can also be created when people use portable generators or run cars in their garages to stay warm or charge their phones.",
      "Dr. Alex Harding, assistant professor of emergency medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said that because carbon monoxide is odorless and colorless, people won\u2019t necessarily be aware of it.",
      "\u201cThe symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning can be really insidious. They can sneak up on patients and can range from just developing a headache or maybe a little bit of nausea to all the way to losing consciousness and seizures,\u201d he said.",
      "The cold weather hitting much of the East Coast has the ability to be dangerous or deadly because of unsafe exposure to elements. This week's winter storms are tracking to the south, and cold air will likely be present as far south as Georgia, said Jon Palmer, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Gray, Maine.",
      "The cold temperatures could sneak up on people in parts of the country that have largely experienced a mild winter so far.",
      "\u201cReally cold temperatures and winds can make temperatures feel a lot colder, and the result of that could be cold air that could eventually lead to frostbite at a much faster rate or hypothermia at a much faster rate than normal,\u201d Palmer said.",
      "Prolonged exposure to frigid temperatures can put people at risk to hypothermia, a condition that happens when one\u2019s body loses heat faster than it can produce it.",
      "\u201cHypothermia is definitely one of the bigger concerns, especially if we do have any kind of certainty in like power grids or electricity failing,\u201d Harding said.",
      "The danger of hypothermia is greater for someone who is outside, exposed to wind gusts and isn\u2019t wearing appropriate clothing or has clothing that gets wet.",
      "\u201cIf they have a safe place that\u2019s warm, where they can hunker down, where they have water and food and all those kind of necessities \u2026 then that\u2019s going to limit their exposure to those risks,\u201d Harding said.",
      "But vulnerable populations like people with disabilities or homeless individuals can have problems finding a warm and safe place to stay.",
      "Frozen pipes in a home during severe winter weather is a particular problem in parts of the South because such equipment is often located outside structures. But other parts of the country also have to deal with this problem.",
      "Jose Parra, a master plumber with Abacus Plumbing, Air Conditioning & Electrical in Houston, advises people to insulate any pipes that are exposed to the outside, turn off and drain sprinkler systems and let faucets inside a home drip during freezing temperatures so water can run through the pipes and protect them.",
      "\u201cA lot of what we\u2019re fixing, I would say 80% to 90%, could have been prevented with just a little bit of work ahead of time,\u201d Parra said.",
      "Experts acknowledge that cold weather can be hard for electric vehicles, but they say with some planning and a little adjustment, owners should be able to travel pretty much as normal.",
      "Inside EV batteries, lithium ions flow through a liquid electrolyte, producing electricity. But they travel more slowly through the electrolyte when it gets cold and don\u2019t release as much energy. That cuts into the range and can deplete a battery faster.",
      "In the short run, automakers are likely to come up with better ways to protect battery life and warm them for charging, Neil Dasgupta, associate professor of mechanical and materials science engineering at the University of Michigan, told The Associated Press earlier this year. And there are new battery chemistries in development that are more resilient in cold weather.",

      "For McCoy and others, figuring out how to obtain adequate care to safely have a baby in Baker City has quickly eclipsed concerns about another medical service lacking in the area: abortion. But in Oregon and elsewhere in the country, progressive lawmakers' attempts to expand abortion access sometimes clash with rural constituencies.",
      "",
      "Oregon is considered one of the most protective states in the country when it comes to abortion. There are no legal limits on when someone can receive an abortion in the state, and the service is covered by its Medicaid system. Still, efforts to expand access in the rural, largely conservative areas that cover most of the state have encountered resistance and incredulity.",
      "",
      "It's a divide that has played out in elections in such states as Nevada, where voters passed a ballot measure in November that seeks to codify abortion protections in the state constitution. Residents in several rural counties opposed the measure.",
      "",
      "In Oregon, during the months just before the Baker City closure was announced, Democratic state lawmakers were focused on a proposed pilot program that would launch two mobile reproductive healthcare clinics in rural areas. The bill specified that the van-based clinics would include abortion services.",
      "",
      "State Rep. Christine Goodwin, a Republican from a southwestern Oregon district, called the proposal the \"latest example\" of urban legislators telling rural leaders what their communities need.",
      "",
      "The mobile health clinic pilot was eventually removed from the bill that was under discussion. That means no new abortion options in Oregon's Baker County  --  and no new state-funded maternity care either.",
      "",
      "\"I think if you expanded rural access in this community to abortions before you extended access to maternal healthcare, you would have an uprising on your hands,\" said Paige Witham, 27, a member of the Baker County healthcare steering committee and the mother of two children, including an infant born in October.",
      "",
      "A study published in JAMA in early December that examined nearly 5,000 acute care hospitals found that by 2022, 52% of rural hospitals lacked obstetrics care after more than a decade of unit closures. The health implications of those closures for young women, the population most likely to need pregnancy care, and their babies can be significant. Research has shown that added distance between a patient and obstetric care increases the likelihood the baby will be admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit, or NICU.",
      "",
      "Witham said that while she does not support abortion, she believes the government should not \"legislate it away completely.\" She said that unless the government provides far more support for young families, like free child care and better mental healthcare, abortion should remain legal.",
      "",
      "Conversations with a liberal school board member, a moderate owner of a timber company, members of Baker City's Republican Party chapter, a local doula, several pregnant women, and the director of the Baker County Health Department  --  many of whom were not rigidly opposed to abortion  --  all turned up the same answer: No mobile clinics offering abortions here, please.",
      "",
      "Kelle Osborn, RN, a nurse supervisor for the Baker County Health Department, loved the idea of a mobile clinic that would provide education and birth control services to people in outlying areas. She was less thrilled about including abortion services in a clinic on wheels.",
      "",
      "\"It's not something that should just be handed out from a mobile van,\" she said of abortion services. She said people in her conservative rural county would probably avoid using the clinics for anything if they were understood to provide abortion services.",
      "",
      "Both Osborn and Meghan Chancey, MPH, the health department's director, said they would rank many healthcare priorities higher, including the need for a general surgeon, an ICU, and a dialysis clinic.",
      "",
      "Nationally, reproductive healthcare services of all types tend to be limited for people in rural areas, even within states that protect abortion access. More than two-thirds of people in \"maternity care deserts\"  --  all of which are in rural counties  --  must drive more than a half-hour to get obstetric care, according to a 2024 March of Dimes report. For people in the Southern states where lawmakers installed abortion bans, abortion care can be up to 700 miles away, according to a data analysis by Axios.",
      "",
      "Nathan Defrees, MD, grew up in Baker City and has practiced medicine here since 2017. He works for a family medicine clinic. If a patient asks about abortion, he provides information about where and how one can be obtained, but he doesn't offer abortions himself.",

      "\"There's not a lot of anonymity in small towns for physicians who provide that care,\" he said. \"Many of us aren't willing to sacrifice the rest of our career for that.\"",
      "",
      "He also pointed to the small number of patients requesting the service locally. Just six people living in Baker County had an abortion in 2023, according to data from the Oregon Department of Public Health. Meanwhile, 125 residents had a baby that year.",
      "",
      "A doctor with obstetric training living in another rural part of the state has chosen to quietly provide early-stage abortions when asked. The doctor, concerned for their family's safety in the small, conservative town where they live, asked not to be identified.",
      "",
      "The idea that better access to abortion is not needed in rural areas seems naive, the doctor said. People most in need of abortion often don't have access to any medical service not already available in town, the doctor pointed out. The first patient the doctor provided an abortion for at the clinic was a meth user with no resources to travel or to manage an at-home medication abortion.",
      "",
      "\"It seemed entirely inappropriate for me to turn her away for care I had the training and the tools to do,\" the doctor said.",
      "",

      "",
      "A new Planned Parenthood clinic in Ontario, Oregon, 70 miles away in neighboring Malheur County, was built primarily to provide services to people from the Boise metro area, but it also created an option for many living in rural eastern Oregon.",

      "Flu is taking off in the U.S., with 40 states reporting high or very high levels of flu-like illness last week",
      "The holidays came with a side of flu for many Americans, with 40 states reporting high or very high levels of illness last week, according to the latest government health data.",
      "\u201cA lot of flu out there,\u201d said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Carrie Reed.",
      "Of course, there are a number of bugs that cause fever, cough, sore throat and other flu-like symptoms. One is COVID-19. Another is RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, which is a common cause of cold-like symptoms but can be dangerous for infants and the elderly.",
      "The most recent CDC hospitalization data and other indicators show that the flu virus is trending higher than the other germs, Reed said. Several seasonal flu strains are driving cases, with no dominant one, she added.",
      "Pediatric hospitals have been busy since November with RSV, but \u201cinfluenza has now joined the party,\u201d said Dr. Jason Newland, an infectious diseases specialist at Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.",
      "\u201cNow we\u2019re really starting to roll,\u201d he added. \u201dOur hospitals are busy.\u201d",
      "One indicator of flu activity is the percentage of doctor\u2019s office visits driven by flu-like symptoms. That level last week was about equal to the peak of last winter\u2019s respiratory virus season \u2014 which occurred at the same time of year. Reed noted that most people avoid medical appointments over the holidays if they can help it, so the data in late December might be skewed by people who came down with sudden illnesses.",
      "Last week's flu activity was particularly intense in the South, Southwest and western U.S. The states reporting lesser amounts of suffering were mostly in the northern Great Plains and in New England.",
      "So far this season, the CDC estimates, there have been at least 5.3 million flu illnesses, 63,000 hospitalizations, and 2,700 deaths \u2014 including at least 11 children.",
      "It\u2019s not clear if this winter respiratory virus season will be any worse than others. So far it seems relatively typical, at least for kids, Newland said.",
      "U.S. health officials recommends that everyone 6 months and older get an annual flu vaccination, and they say it\u2019s not too late to get a shot.",
      "You should also avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth because germs can spread that way, health officials say. You should also wash your hands with soap and water, clean frequently touched surfaces and avoid close contact with people who are sick.",
      "The CDC also has been keeping its eye on a rise of illnesses from norovirus, a nasty stomach bug, with 91 outbreaks reported early in December.",
      "Investigators also have been closely watching another kind of influenza virus, the Type A H5N1 version of bird flu. The CDC says 66 human U.S. cases of that were reported last year, but none of them in the last week.",
      "The cases are \u201cfairly sporadic\u201d and the overall risk to the public remains low, Reed said. Almost all have been traced to direct contact with infected animals, with no proof of spread between people.",

    "summary": "Five years after the virus that causes COVID emerged in China it still holds some mysteries",
    "story": [
      "Five years after the virus that causes COVID emerged in China it still holds some mysteries",
      "Five years ago, a cluster of people in Wuhan, China, fell sick with a virus never before seen in the world.",
      "The germ didn't have a name, nor did the illness it would cause. It wound up setting off a pandemic that exposed deep inequities in the global health system and reshaped public opinion about how to control deadly emerging viruses.",
      "The virus is still with us, though humanity has built up immunity through vaccinations and infections. It's less deadly than it was in the pandemic's early days and it no longer tops the list of leading causes of death. But the virus is evolving, meaning scientists must track it closely.",
      "We don\u2019t know. Scientists think the most likely scenario is that it circulated in bats, like many coronaviruses. They think it then infected another species, probably racoon dogs, civet cats or bamboo rats, which in turn infected humans handling or butchering those animals at a market in Wuhan, where the first human cases appeared in late November 2019.",
      "That's a known pathway for disease transmission and likely triggered the first epidemic of a similar virus, known as SARS. But this theory has not been proven for the virus that causes COVID-19. Wuhan is home to several research labs involved in collecting and studying coronaviruses, fueling debate over whether the virus instead may have leaked from one.",
      "It's a difficult scientific puzzle to crack in the best of circumstances. The effort has been made even more challenging by political sniping around the virus' origins and by what international researchers say are moves by China to withhold evidence that could help.",
      "The true origin of the pandemic may not be known for many years \u2014 if ever.",
      "Probably more than 20 million. The World Health Organization has said member countries reported more than 7 million deaths from COVID-19 but the true death toll is estimated to be at least three times higher.",
      "In the U.S., an average of about 900 people a week have died of COVID-19 over the past year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The coronavirus continues to affect older adults the most. Last winter in the U.S., people age 75 and older accounted for about half the nation\u2019s COVID-19 hospitalizations and in-hospital deaths, according to the CDC.",
      "\u201cWe cannot talk about COVID in the past, since it\u2019s still with us,\u201d WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.",
      "Scientists and vaccine-makers broke speed records developing COVID-19 vaccines that have saved tens of millions of lives worldwide \u2013 and were the critical step to getting life back to normal.",
      "Less than a year after China identified the virus, health authorities in the U.S. and Britain cleared vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna. Years of earlier research \u2014 including Nobel-winning discoveries that were key to making the new technology work \u2014 gave a head start for so-called mRNA vaccines.",
      "Today, there\u2019s also a more traditional vaccine made by Novavax, and some countries have tried additional options. Rollout to poorer countries was slow but the WHO estimates more than 13 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered globally since 2021.",
      "The vaccines aren't perfect. They do a good job of preventing severe disease, hospitalization and death, and have proven very safe, with only rare serious side effects. But protection against milder infection begins to wane after a few months.",
      "Like flu vaccines, COVID-19 shots must be updated regularly to match the ever-evolving virus \u2014 contributing to public frustration at the need for repeated vaccinations. Efforts to develop next-generation vaccines are underway, such as nasal vaccines that researchers hope might do a better job of blocking infection.",
      "Genetic changes called mutations happen as viruses make copies of themselves. And this virus has proven to be no different.",
      "Scientists named these variants after Greek letters: alpha, beta, gamma, delta and omicron. Delta, which became dominant in the U.S. in June 2021, raised a lot of concerns because it was twice as likely to lead to hospitalization as the first version of the virus.",
      "Then in late November 2021, a new variant came on the scene: omicron.",
      "\u201cIt spread very rapidly,\" dominating within weeks, said Dr. Wesley Long, a pathologist at Houston Methodist in Texas. \u201cIt drove a huge spike in cases compared to anything we had seen previously.\u201d",
      "But on average, the WHO said, it caused less severe disease than delta. Scientists believe that may be partly because immunity had been building due to vaccination and infections.",
      "\u201cEver since then, we just sort of keep seeing these different subvariants of omicron accumulating more different mutations,\u201d Long said. \u201cRight now, everything seems to locked on this omicron branch of the tree.\u201d",
      "The omicron relative now dominant in the U.S. is called XEC, which accounted for 45% of variants circulating nationally in the two-week period ending Dec. 21, the CDC said. Existing COVID-19 medications and the latest vaccine booster should be effective against it, Long said, since \u201cit\u2019s really sort of a remixing of variants already circulating.\u201d",
      "Millions of people remain in limbo with a sometimes disabling, often invisible, legacy of the pandemic called long COVID.",
      "It can take several weeks bounce back after a bout of COVID-19, but some people develop more persistent problems. The symptoms that last at least three months, sometimes for years, include fatigue, cognitive trouble known as \u201cbrain fog,\u201d pain and cardiovascular problems, among others.",
      "Doctors don\u2019t know why only some people get long COVID. It can happen even after a mild case and at any age, although rates have declined since the pandemic's early years. Studies show vaccination can lower the risk.",
      "It also isn't clear what causes long COVID, which complicates the search for treatments. One important clue: Increasingly researchers are discovering that remnants of the coronavirus can persist in some patients\u2019 bodies long after their initial infection, although that can\u2019t explain all cases.",

      "This week, companies and people will be able to apply for licenses to administer the mind-altering drug, though treatment will likely not be available for some months as applications are processed.",
      "Colorado joined Oregon in legalizing psilocybin therapy, though the drug remains illegal in most other states and federally. Over the last year, a growing number of Oregon cities have voted to ban psilocybin. While Colorado metros cannot ban the treatment under state law, several conservative cities have worked to preemptively restrict what are known as \u201chealing centers.\u201d",
      "At a City Council meeting in Colorado Springs this month, members were set to vote on extending the state prohibition on healing centers from 1,000 feet (305 meters) to 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) from certain locations, such as schools. From the lectern, veterans implored them not to.",
      "\u201cWe have an opportunity to support veterans, and it\u2019s a really easy one to say \u2018Yes\u2019 to,\u201d said Lane Belone, a special forces veteran who said he's benefited from his own psychedelic experiences. Belone argued that the restrictions effectively limit the number of centers and would mean longer waiting lists for the treatment.",
      "Veterans have pulled in some conservative support for psychedelic therapy \u2014 managing to set it apart from other politically charged drug policies such as legalizing marijuana.",
      "That distinction was made clear by Councilmember David Leinweber, who said at the council meeting both that marijuana is \u201cliterally killing our kids\u201d and that he supported greater access to psilocybin therapy.",
      "Psilocybin is far more restricted in Colorado than marijuana, which the state legalized in 2014. Psilocybin is decriminalized but there won\u2019t be recreational dispensaries for the substance, which will be largely confined to licensed businesses and therapy sessions with licensed facilitators.",
      "Patients will have to go through a risk assessment, preliminary meetings, then follow-up sessions and remain with a facilitator while under the drug's influence. The psilocybin will also be tested, and the companies that grow them regulated by a state agency.",
      "Still, allowing broader access to the treatment hasn't been easy for most of the city councilmembers, including three who are veterans. Colorado Springs is home to two Air Force bases and the U.S. Air Force Academy, and local leaders frequently tout it as an ideal community for retired service members.",
      "\u201cI will never sit up here and criticize a veteran for wanting to find a medical treatment to fix or to help with the issues that they carry,\u201d said Council President Randy Helms, a veteran himself.",
      "Still, he continued, \u201cDo I think that it\u2019s helpful to not just veterans but to individuals? Probably so. Do I think it still needs to be tested under strict requirements? Yes.\u201d",
      "The Colorado Springs City Council passed the proposed restrictions.",
      "While research has shown promise for psychedelic drugs such as psilocybin and MDMA, also known as molly, in helping people with conditions such as alcoholism, depression and PTSD, the scientific field remains in its relatively early stages.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very positive about the potential value, but I\u2019m very concerned that we\u2019ve gotten too far ahead of our skis,\u201d said Jeffrey Lieberman, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University, who's been involved in studies of psychedelic drugs' therapeutic efficacy.",
      "The risks, said Lieberman, include customers being misled and paying out of pocket for expensive treatments. He also said there are cases where the drugs can exacerbate some extreme mental health conditions, such as schizophrenia.",
      "In Oregon, where the treatments started in June 2023, costs can reach $2,000 for one session. Of the over 16,000 doses administered in the state, staff have only called 911 or taken a patient to the hospital five times.",
      "Other Colorado Springs city councilmembers raised concerns that the Food and Drug Administration has not approved psilocybin to treat mental health conditions and, in August, rejected the psychedelic MDMA to treat PTSD. A number of clinical trials are still underway for both drugs.",
      "Some researchers, advocacy groups and veterans worry that waiting on slow-moving bureaucracy \u2014 namely the FDA \u2014 carries its own risks as people continue to struggle with mental illnesses. Advocates argue that psychedelic therapy offers an option to those for whom talk therapy alone and antidepressants have not helped.",
      "\u201cThis is a crisis that we are in, and this is a tool that we can add to our toolbox,\u201d said Taylor West, executive director of the Healing Advocacy Fund, which advocates for psychedelic therapy.",
      "Belone said he's carried his military experience long after leaving the special forces. It started when he first heard artillery sirens wailing in a U.S. base in Iraq, his breath catching with fear for a few thudding moments.",
      "That fear kept him on edge when he returned stateside and found himself always keeping his back to the wall, looking for exits to the room he was in, never quite able to give himself fully to the music at a concert.",
      "A psychedelic experience with psilocybin, said Belone, helped him connect the fear that attached to him in the war zone to the ceaseless anxiety at home. It didn\u2019t solve everything overnight, he said, but it allowed him to better identify when that humming fear was getting in the way of a joyful life.",

      "A new year brings new goals",
      "New York -- A new year is the time to set new goals. Yet studies have shown that most people don\u2019t tend to uphold their New Year\u2019s resolutions much past the first month.",
      "In an attempt to reframe the thinking around new year goal-setting, a new wellness trend has popped up online. It\u2019s called the \u2019Winter Arc.\u2019",
      "Here\u2019s what to know.",
      "The goal-setting challenge was created online by fitness and wellness influencers, so there isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all approach or standard definition. There are over 400,000 posts on Instagram with the caption #winterarc, and almost 600,000 on TikTok.",
      "For many of those trying the trend, the Winter Arc involves utilizing the cold, dark earlier months of winter to turn inward and get a jump start on their goals, with the intent of having them in place by the time Jan. 1 rolls around.",
      "It\u2019s also meant to encourage participants to be extremely disciplined and rigid with their goals since it\u2019s a shorter period to get them done rather than an entire year, or indefinitely.",
      "Laura Galebe, an influencer and the self-proclaimed \u201cCEO of Glowup Series,\u201d posts videos to her social media accounts talking about her Winter Arc experience. She used the time to commit to \u201cwalking every day, journaling, and sticking to (her) skincare and wellness routines.\u201d",
      "\u201cI found it very transformative both mentally and physically,\u201d Galebe says. \u201cThe consistent movement helped me stay energized and the structure made the season feel a lot less heavy.\u201d",
      "Although some say the Winter Arc challenge can begin in October, it\u2019s never too late to start. According to Alex Rothstein, an exercise psychologist with the New York Institute of Technology, the best way to dive in is to carve out time each day to work on your goals.",
      "\u201cIf you make sure to actively plan and schedule each commitment,\" Rothstein says, \u201cyou will have an easier time adhering to the program.\u201d",
      "He also recommends setting reasonable, realistic goals that are achievable from day to day. \u201cRecognize that if unforeseen circumstances cause you to miss a day or miss a specific goal in a day, it does not mean you failed the entire process,\u201d he says. \u201cYou should be willing to pick up where you started the next day.\u201d",
      "Galebe recommends finding ways to make fitness \u201ccozy and convenient\u201d in the cold winter months.",
      "\u201cIf the thought of heading to the gym in freezing weather is demotivating, consider at-home workouts or joining a heated indoor Pilates or yoga studio,\u201d she says. \u201cAnother tip is to reframe movement as self-care. Winter is tough on your body and mind so I treat my walks or workouts as part of keeping my overall mental and physical health in check.\u201d",
      "To recap:",
      "\u2014Set realistic, attainable goals.",
      "\u2014Plan out your routine and find the time in your schedule in advance.",
      "\u2014Be okay with missing a day, giving yourself the space to pick up where you left off.",
      "\u2014Find cozy and convenient ways to stay active in the colder months.",
      "Elliot Berkman, a professor of psychology at the University of Oregon, says that goal progress, rather than simply goal attainment, is psychologically beneficial. He says it can provide \u201cpositive emotion, a sense of purpose and meaning as well as agency and autonomy.\u201d",
      "When it comes to goal-setting in a short, specific period of time, like the Winter Arc, he says those parameters can be helpful. \u201cPutting a time bound on a goal can improve the chances the goal is achieved. It\u2019s easier to maintain motivation if you know that you get to stop at some point as opposed to feeling like you need to keep up the hard work indefinitely, which can be demotivating.\u201d",
      "Some on social media have made comparisons between short-term fitness challenges and crash diets, with the idea being that once the challenge stops, one could return to unhealthy habits. But experts say that\u2019s not necessarily true.",
      "\u201cIf the challenge is used to help establish new and healthier habits for long term health and wellness, than the challenges are exceptionally useful to help guide and motivate to create these changes,\u201d Rothstein says. He recommends making a plan toward the end of the challenge to continue keeping up with your goals in an attainable and realistic way."

      "Baxter's North Cove, North Carolina, facility provided about 60% of the IV solutions used across the U.S. as well as several other fluids vital to patient care, noted Nancy Foster, vice president of quality and safety policy at the American Hospital Association (AHA). \"While remarkable progress has been made in reactivating Baxter's plant operations, hospitals are still receiving less than their normal required amounts of these fluids.\"",
      "",
      "While the impact of the supply shortage varies across the country, \"and the significance of the impact on a particular hospital depends on the methods they have been using to conserve fluids, whether Baxter was their sole supplier, the patient population they serve, and other factors,\" Foster said, \"we know some hospitals are still restricting access to elective surgeries, and most are using alternative strategies for hydrating patients when possible and utilizing smaller bags of fluids when appropriate.\"",
      "",
      "Though hospitals have long endured shortages of a variety of medical supplies and drugs, the shortage of IV fluids has been different, Foster told MedPage Today.",
      "",
      "\"These fluids are widely used as part of treatment for a multitude of illnesses or injuries,\" Foster said in an email. \"A majority of hospitalized patients receive drugs through IV infusions at least at some point during their hospital stay.\"",
      "",
      "The shortage was also unique because both the FDA and the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response \"acted almost immediately after the hurricane damage to help expedite Baxter's ability to get its plant operational again,\" she said. \"Restoration of the flow of these fluids is faster than it would have been, even if it is not as fast as we would like given that hospitals are adamant about providing the best possible care for patients, and that requires that we have the fluids our patients need.\"",
      "",
      "Baxter pointed MedPage Today to updates it has continued to issue on its progress at the North Cove manufacturing site.",
      "",
      "In a Dec. 19 update, the company noted that it has restarted eight of the 10 manufacturing lines at the site, representing approximately 85% of total pre-hurricane capacity.",
      "",
      "\"While the recently restarted lines will require time to ramp up, some of the earlier lines to restart are operating near pre-hurricane levels,\" the company noted. \"We currently expect to be producing at pre-hurricane levels across the plant early in the first quarter of 2025.\"",
      "",
      "While it will \"take some time for product to flow through the distribution channels,\" Baxter said that \"we currently expect that North Cove's recovery to full production will translate to removal of allocations for the related product groups during the first quarter of 2025.\"",
      "",
      "Previously, in a Dec. 5 update, the company noted initial resumption of all of its 3L irrigation manufacturing lines and peritoneal dialysis solutions manufacturing lines. Baxter also previously detailed that the IV solutions manufacturing lines restarted in November produce much of the site's pre-hurricane capacity of 1-liter IV solutions, \"the most commonly used size by hospitals and clinics.\"",
      "",
      "\"We anticipate [the shortage] will continue well into January,\" Foster added, \"but are hopeful that we will continue to see improvement along the way such that the magnitude of the problem will diminish week by week as more of Baxter's production lines are operational and the FDA verifies that the fluids they produce are safe for use.\""

      "A series of Israeli airstrikes flattened several buildings in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs on Sept. 27, 2023, killing Nasrallah. The Lebanese Health Ministry said six people died. According to news reports, Nasrallah and other senior officials were meeting underground.",
      "The assassination of Nasrallah, who had led Hezbollah for 32 years, turned months of low-level strikes between Israel and the militants into all-out war that battered much of southern and eastern Lebanon for two months until a U.S.-brokered ceasefire took effect Nov. 27.",

      "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he will again call on allies to boost its air defenses at this week\u2019s meeting in Germany",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he will again call on allies to boost its air defenses at this week's meeting in Germany, as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes over later this month with a vow to end the almost three-year war quickly.",
      "Zelenskyy said that dozens of partner countries will participate in the meeting of the Ramstein group at Ramstein Air Base in Germany on Thursday, \u201cincluding those who can help boost our capabilities not only to defend against missiles but also against guided bombs and Russian aviation.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will discuss this with them and continue to persuade them,\u201d Zelenskyy said in his nightly address on Saturday. \u201cThe task remains unchanged: strengthening our air defense.\u201d",
      "U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin will attend the meeting. Biden was originally scheduled to attend the October summit in Ramstein but it was postponed because of response to Hurricane Milton that battered the U.S.",
      "In its last few weeks in office, the Biden administration was pressing to send as much military aid as possible to Ukraine before Trump is sworn in Jan. 20.",
      "Trump claimed during his election campaign that he could end the war in one day and his comments have put a question mark over whether the United States will continue to be Ukraine\u2019s biggest \u2014 and most important \u2014 military backer.",
      "Zelenskyy said last week that Trump is \"strong and unpredictable,\u201d and those qualities can be a decisive factor in his policy approach to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Russia controls about one-fifth of Ukraine, and capitalized last year on weaknesses in Ukraine\u2019s defenses to slowly advance in eastern areas despite high losses of troops and equipment. The war\u2019s trajectory isn\u2019t in Ukraine\u2019s favor. The country is shorthanded on the front line and needs continued support from its Western partners.",
      "Zelenskyy said Saturday that Russian and North Korean troops had suffered heavy losses in the fighting in Russia\u2019s Kursk region.",
      "\u201cIn battles yesterday and today near just one village, Makhnovka, in the Kursk region, the Russian army lost up to a battalion of North Korean infantry soldiers and Russian paratroopers,\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cThis is significant.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy said last month that 3,000 North Korean troops had been killed and wounded in Kursk, where Ukrainian forces launched an incursion in August, dealing a blow to Russia\u2019s prestige and forcing it to deploy some of its troops from a slow-moving offensive in eastern Ukraine.",
      "The incursion didn\u2019t significantly change the dynamic of the war, and military analysts say Ukraine has lost around 40% of the land it initially captured.",
      "In other developments, nine people were wounded in a Russian guided bomb attack on the border town of Semenivka in Ukraine\u2019s northern Chernihiv region on Saturday evening, local officials said.",
      "Moscow sent 103 drones into Ukraine overnight into Sunday, Ukrainian officials said. According to Ukraine\u2019s air force, 61 drones were destroyed and 42 were lost likely due to electronic jamming.",
      "Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said that 61 Ukrainian drones were shot down overnight into Sunday in five regions of western Russia. No casualties were reported but Rostov regional Gov. Yuri Slyusar said residential buildings and cars had been damaged by falling drone debris.",

      "Costas Simitis, former prime minister of Greece and the architect of the country\u2019s joining the common European currency, the euro, has died at 88, state TV ERT reports",
      "ATHENS, Greece -- Costas Simitis, former prime minister of Greece and the architect of the country\u2019s joining the common European currency, the euro, has died at age 88, state TV ERT reported.",
      "Simitis was taken to a hospital in the city of Corinth early Sunday morning from his holiday home west of Athens, unconscious and without a pulse, the hospital\u2019s director was quoted as saying by Greek media. An autopsy will be performed to determine the cause of death.",
      "The government decreed a four-day period of official mourning. Simitis will receive a state funeral.",
      "Warm tributes appeared, and not just from political allies.",
      "\u201cI bid farewell to Costas Simitis with sadness and respect. A worthy and noble political opponent,\u201d Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said in a Facebook post, also saluting the \u201cgood professor and moderate parliamentarian.\u201d",
      "Another conservative politician, former European Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos, recalled how he, as mayor of Athens, had cooperated \u201cseamlessly and warmly\u201d with Simitis in organizing the Olympic Games.",
      "\u201cHe served the country with devotion and a sense of duty. ... He was steadfast in facing difficult challenges and promoted policies that changed the lives of (many) citizens,\u201d Avramopoulos added.",
      "Simitis, a co-founder of the Socialist PASOK party in 1974, eventually became the successor to the party\u2019s founding leader, Andreas Papandreou, with whom he had an often contentious relationship that shaped the party\u2019s nature. Simitis was a low-key pragmatist where Papandreou was a charismatic, fiery populist. He was also a committed pro-European, while Papandreou banked on strong opposition to Greece\u2019s joining what was then the European Economic Community in the 1970s, before changing tack once he became prime minister.",
      "When the profligate first four years of socialist rule, from 1981 to 1985, resulted in a rapidly deteriorating economy, Papandreou elevated Simitis to be finance minister and oversee a tight austerity program. Finances improved, inflation was partly tamed, but Simitis was pushed to resign in 1987 when Papandreou, eyeing an upcoming election, announced a generous wages policy, undermining the goals of the austerity program.",
      "The socialists returned to power with Papandreou still at the helm in 1993, but he was ailing and finally resigned the premiership in January 1996. A tight two rounds of voting among the socialist lawmakers unexpectedly elevated Simitis to the post of prime minister, a post he held until 2004.",
      "Simitis considered Greece\u2019s entry into the eurozone, in January 2001, as the signature achievement of his premiership. But he also helped secure the 2004 Olympic Games for Athens and presided over a vast program of infrastructure building, including a brand new airport and two subway lines, to help host the games. He also helped Cyprus join the European Union in 2004.",
      "His critics on the right and left did their best to denigrate his legacy, highlighting a dubious debt swap concluded after the country had joined the eurozone as an attempt to massage the debt numbers.",
      "In the end, it was determined opposition from his own party, including trade union leaders, to pension reform in 2001 that fatally weakened Simitis\u2019 administration. He decided to resign his party post and not contest the 2004 election, five months before the Olympics, rather than face certain defeat to the conservatives.",
      "George Papandreou, son of the socialist party\u2019s founder, succeeded him as party leader, and in 2008 expelled Simitis from the PASOK parliamentary group after the two men clashed over policies, including Papandreou\u2019s proposal to hold a referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon. Simitis left parliament in 2009, but not before issuing a prescient warning that financial mismanagement would bring the country under the tutelage of the International Monetary Fund, which would impose harsh austerity. In the end, it was the IMF, jointly with the EU, that imposed a harsh regime on a bankrupt country in 2010.",
      "Costas Simitis was born on June 23, 1936, the younger son of two politically active parents. His lawyer father Georgios was a member of the left-leaning resistance \u201cgovernment\u201d during the German occupation and his mother, Fani, was an active feminist.",
      "Simitis studied law at the University of Marburg, in Germany, in the 1950s, and economics and politics at the London School of Economics in the early 1960s. He later taught law at the University of Athens. His elder brother Spiros, who died in 2023, was a noted legal scholar in Germany, specializing in data protection.",
      "Simitis is survived by his wife of 60 years, Daphne, two daughters and a granddaughter.",

    "story": [
      "Jimmy Carter was the first U_S_ president to make a state visit to sub-Saharan Africa, declaring \u201cthe day of the so-called ugly American is over.\u201d",
      "NAIROBI, Kenya -- NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) \u2014 Jimmy Carter was the first U.S. president to make a state visit to sub-Saharan Africa. He once called helping with Zimbabwe\u2019s transition from white rule to independence \u201cour greatest single success.\u201d And when he died at 100, his foundation\u2019s work in rural Africa had nearly fulfilled his quest to eliminate a disease that afflicted millions, for the first time since the eradication of smallpox.",
      "The African continent, a booming region with a population rivaling China\u2019s that is set to double by 2050, is where Carter's legacy remains most evident. Until his presidency, U.S. leaders had shown little interest in Africa, even as independence movements swept the region in the 1960s and '70s.",
      "\u201cI think the day of the so-called ugly American is over,\u201d Carter said during his warm 1978 reception in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country. He said the official state visit swept aside \u201cpast aloofness by the United States,\u201d and he joked that he and Nigerian President Olesegun Obasanjo would go into peanut farming together.",
      "Cold War tensions drew Carter's attention to the continent as the U.S. and Soviet Union competed for influence. But Carter also drew on the missionary traditions of his Baptist faith and the racial injustice he witnessed in his homeland in the U.S. South.",
      "\u201cFor too long our country ignored Africa,\u201d Carter told the Democratic National Committee in his first year as president.",
      "African leaders soon received invitations to the White House, intrigued by the abrupt interest from the world\u2019s most powerful nation and what it could mean for them.",
      "\u201cThere is an air of freshness which is invigorating,\" visiting Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda said.",
      "Carter observed after his first Africa trip, \u201cThere is a common theme that runs through the advice to me of leaders of African nations: \u2018We want to manage our own affairs. We want to be friends with both of the great superpowers and also with the nations of Europe. We don\u2019t want to choose up sides.\u2019\u201d",
      "The theme echoes today as China also jostles with Russia and the U.S. for influence, and access to Africa's raw materials. But neither superpower has had an emissary like Carter, who made human rights central to U.S. foreign policy and made 43 more trips to the continent after his presidency, promoting Carter Center projects that sought to empower Africans to determine their own futures.",
      "As president, Carter focused on civil and political rights. He later broadened his efforts to include social and economic rights as the key to public health.",
      "\u201cThey are the rights of the human by virtue of their humanity. And Carter is the single person in the world that has done the most for advancing this idea,\u201d said Abdullahi Ahmed An-Naim, a Sudanese legal scholar.",
      "Even as a candidate, Carter mused about what he might accomplish, telling Playboy magazine, \u201cit might be that now I should drop my campaign for president and start a crusade for black-majority rule in South Africa or Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). It might be that later on, we\u2019ll discover there were opportunities in our lives to do wonderful things and we didn\u2019t take advantage of them.\u201d",
      "Carter welcomed Zimbabwe\u2019s independence just four years later, hosting new Prime Minister Robert Mugabe at the White House and quoting the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.: \u201cInjustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\u201d",
      "\u201cCarter told me that he spent more time on Rhodesia than he did on the entire Middle East. And when you go into the archives and look at the administration, there is indeed more on southern Africa than the Middle East,\u201d historian and author Nancy Mitchell said.",
      "Relations with Mugabe\u2019s government soon soured amid deadly repression and by 1986 Carter led a walkout of diplomats in the capital. In 2008, Carter was barred from Zimbabwe, a first in his travels. He called the country \u201ca basket case, an embarrassment to the region.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhatever the Zimbabwean leadership may think of him now, Zimbabweans, at least those who were around in the 1970s and \u201980s, will always regard him as an icon and a tenacious promoter of democracy,\u201d said Eldred Masunungure, a Harare-based political analyst.",
      "Carter also criticized South Africa\u2019s government for its treatment of Black citizens under apartheid, at a time when South Africa was \u201ctrying to ingratiate itself with influential economies around the world,\u201d current President Cyril Ramaphosa said on X after Carter\u2019s death.",
      "The think tank Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter founded in 1982 played a key role in monitoring African elections and brokering cease-fires between warring forces, but fighting disease was the third pillar of The Carter Center's work.",
      "\u201cThe first time I came here to Cape Town, I almost got in a fight with the president of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki, because he was refusing to let AIDS be treated,\u201d Carter told a local newspaper. \u201cThat\u2019s the closest I\u2019ve come to getting into a fist fight with a head of state.\u201d",
      "Carter often said he was determined to outlive the last guinea worm infecting the human race. Once affecting millions of people, the parasitic disease has nearly been eliminated, with just 14 cases documented in 2023 in a handful of African countries.",
      "Carter's quest included arranging a four-month \u201cguinea worm cease-fire\u201d in Sudan in 1995 so that The Carter Center could reach almost 2,000 endemic villages.",
      "\u201cHe taught us a lot about having faith,\u201d said Makoy Samuel Yibi, who leads the guinea worm eradication program for South Sudan's health ministry and grew up with people who believed the disease was simply their fate. \u201cEven the poor people call these people poor, you see. To have the leader of the free world pay attention and try to uplift them is a touching virtue.\u201d",
      "Such dedication impressed health officials in Africa over the years.",
      "\u201cPresident Carter worked for all humankind irrespective of race, religion, or status,\u201d Ethiopia\u2019s former health minister, Lia Tadesse, said in a statement shared with the AP. Ethiopia, the continent\u2019s second most populous country with over 110 million people, had zero guinea worm cases in 2023.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Hundreds of South Koreans, bundled up against freezing temperatures and snow, rallied overnight into Sunday near the residence of impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol, calling for his ouster and arrest, as authorities prepared to renew their efforts to detain him over his short-lived martial law decree.",
      "Dozens of anti-corruption agency investigators and police attempted to execute a detainment warrant against Yoon on Friday but retreated from his residence in Seoul after a tense standoff with the presidential security service that lasted more than five hours.",
      "The one-week warrant for his detention is valid through Monday. There were no immediate indications that anti-corruption authorities were ready to send investigators back to the residence as of Sunday afternoon. Staff from the presidential security service were seen installing barbed wire near the gate and along the hills leading up to Yoon\u2019s residence over the weekend, possibly in preparation for another detention attempt.",
      "A Seoul court last Tuesday issued a warrant to detain Yoon and a separate warrant to search his residence after the embattled president repeatedly defied authorities by refusing to appear for questioning and obstructing searches of his office. But enforcing them is complicated as long as Yoon remains in his official residence.",
      "Investigators from the country\u2019s anti-corruption agency are weighing charges of rebellion after the conservative president, apparently frustrated that his policies were blocked by a legislature dominated by the liberal opposition, declared martial law on Dec. 3 and dispatched troops to surround the National Assembly.",
      "The Assembly overturned the declaration within hours in a unanimous vote and impeached Yoon on Dec. 14, accusing him of rebellion, while South Korean anti-corruption authorities and public prosecutors opened separate investigations into the events.",
      "If the anti-corruption agency manages to detain Yoon, it will likely ask a court for permission to make a formal arrest. Otherwise, Yoon will be released after 48 hours.",
      "The Corruption Investigation for High-Ranking Officials, which is leading a joint investigation with police and military investigators, says detaining Yoon would be \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d as long as he is protected by the presidential security service. The agency has urged the country\u2019s acting leader, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, to instruct the service to comply with their execution of the detainment warrant, but Choi has yet to publicly comment on the issue.",
      "The chiefs and deputy chiefs of the presidential security service defied summonses on Saturday from police, who planned to question them over the suspected obstruction of official duty following Friday's events.",
      "Hundreds of anti-Yoon protesters rallied for hours near the gates of the presidential residence from Saturday evening to Sunday, voicing frustration over the failed detention attempt and demanding stronger efforts to bring Yoon into custody. Separated by police barricades and buses, pro-Yoon protesters were gathering in nearby streets, denouncing his impeachment and vowing to block any efforts to detain him.",
      "Yoon\u2019s lawyers have challenged the detention and search warrants against the president, saying they cannot be enforced at his residence due to a law that protects locations potentially linked to military secrets from search without the consent of the person in charge \u2014 which would be Yoon. They also argue the anti-corruption office lacks the legal authority to investigate rebellion charges and that police officers don\u2019t have the legal authority to assist in detaining Yoon.",
      "While the presidential security act mandates protection for Yoon, it does not authorize the presidential security service to block court-ordered detainments. The service\u2019s attempts to block the execution of the warrant may amount to an obstruction of official duty, according to Park Sung-bae, an attorney specializing in criminal law. While the president mostly has immunity from prosecution while in office, the protection does not extend to allegations of rebellion or treason.",
      "The agency said its outnumbered investigators had several scuffles with presidential security forces that threatened their safety and expressed \u201cserious regret\u201d that Yoon was not complying with the legal process.",
      "After getting around a military unit guarding the residence\u2019s grounds, the agency's investigators and police were able to approach within 200 meters (yards) of Yoon\u2019s residential building but were stopped by a barricade comprising around 10 vehicles and approximately 200 members of the presidential security forces and troops. The agency said it wasn\u2019t able to visually confirm whether Yoon was inside the residence.",
      "The Defense Ministry says the troops at Yoon\u2019s official residence are under the control of the presidential security service. Kim Seon-ho, the acting defense minister, conveyed his concern to the presidential security service, saying that deploying military personnel to block the execution of the detention warrant would be \u201cinappropriate\u201d and requesting that the troops aren't placed in a position where they might confront police, according to the ministry.",
      "Yoon\u2019s defense minister, police chief and several top military commanders have already been arrested over their roles in the period of martial law.",
      "Yoon\u2019s presidential powers have been suspended since the National Assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14. Yoon\u2019s fate now lies with the Constitutional Court, which has begun deliberations on whether to uphold the impeachment and formally remove Yoon from office or reinstate him.",

      "Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer says he will resign in the coming days after talks on forming a new government failed a second time",
      "VIENNA -- Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said Saturday he will resign in the coming days after talks on forming a new government failed a second time.",
      "The announcement came after the People\u2019s Party and the Social Democrats on Saturday continued coalition talks a day after the liberal Neos party\u2019s surprise withdrawal from discussions.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately I have to tell you today that the negotiations have ended and will not be continued by the People\u2019s Party,\u201d said Nehammer, the conservative party's leader, in a statement on social media.",
      "He said that \u201cdestructive forces\u201d in the Social Democratic Party have \u201cgained the upper hand\u201d and that the People\u2019s Party will not sign on to a program that it considers to be against economic competitiveness.",
      "Social democratic leader Andreas Babler said he regretted the People\u2019s Party decision to end the talks. \u201cThis is not a good decision for our country,\u201d he said.",
      "Babler said that one of the main stumbling blocks had to do with how to repair the \u201crecord deficit\u201d left by the previous government.",
      "\u201cI have offered to Karl Nehammer and the People\u2019s Party to continue negotiating and called on them not to give up,\" he told reporters Saturday evening.",
      "The next government in Austria faces the challenge of having to save between 18 to 24 billion euros, according to the EU Commission. In addition, Austria has been in a recession for the past two years, is experiencing rising unemployment, and its budget deficit is currently at 3.7% of Gross Domestic Product \u2014 above the EU\u2019s limit of 3%.",
      "Babler blamed the collapse of the negotiations on \u201cforces within the People\u2019s Party\u201d that were against a coalition with the Social Democrats, while praising Nehammer for his readiness to compromise.",
      "A coalition between the People\u2019s Party and the Social Democrats was considered shaky from the beginning since the two parties together only have a razor-thin one-seat majority in the Austrian parliament.",
      "It was not immediately clear what would happen next.",
      "The People\u2019s Party will have to search for a replacement for Nehammer, who has always ruled out the possibility of a coalition with far-right leader Herbert Kickl. But Nehammer\u2019s expected resignation could now prompt the party to rethink its options under new leadership.",
      "People's Party officials planned to meet Sunday to discuss choosing a new leader.",
      "The People\u2019s Party and the far-right Freedom Party are close on economic policies as well as other issues such as migration and are already working together in five coalitions on the local level.",
      "An early election would be another option. But given Austrian election laws, such an election would unlikely take place before May.",
      "Coalition talks had dragged on after Austria\u2019s president tasked the conservative chancellor in October with putting together a new government. The request came after all other parties refused to work with the leader of the far-right Freedom Party, which in September won a national election for the first time with 29.2% of the vote.",
      "According to the latest opinion polls published in December, the Freedom Party increased its support to between 35% and 37%.",
      "Party leader Herbert Kickl criticized Nehammer, Babler and Austria\u2019s President Alexander Van der Bellen in a written statement on Saturday evening for having created \u201cchaos instead of stability\u201d and said the ball is now in Van der Bellen\u2019s court.",

      "Prince William has expressed his shock and sadness at the news of the death of his former nanny\u2019s stepson in the New Year\u2019s truck attack in New Orleans that killed 14 people",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Prince William expressed his shock and sadness Saturday at the news of the death of his former nanny\u2019s stepson in the New Year's truck attack in New Orleans that killed 14 people.",
      "London\u2019s Metropolitan Police confirmed Saturday that they are supporting the family of 31-year-old Edward Pettifer, including helping them through the process of returning his body to the U.K. Pettifer, who is from west London, is the final victim to be identified.",
      "In a statement on social media, the Prince of Wales said he and his wife, Catherine, were \u201cshocked and saddened by the tragic death of Ed Pettifer. Our thoughts and prayers remain with the Pettifer family and all those innocent people who have been tragically impacted by this horrific attack.\"",
      "Pettifer was the stepson of Tiggy Legge-Bourke, who was the nanny for both William and his brother, Prince Harry, between 1993 and 1999, which included the time after the death of their mother Princess Diana.

      "Authorities say 14 people were killed and about 30 were injured in the attack early Wednesday by Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a former Army soldier who posted several videos on his Facebook hours before the attack previewing the violence he would unleash and proclaiming his support for the Islamic State militant group. The coroner\u2019s office listed the cause of death for all 14 victims as \u201cblunt force injuries.\u201d",

      "Hospital staff in Gaza say the latest Israeli airstrikes have killed at least 21 people including at least two children",
      "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- Israeli airstrikes killed at least 21 people, including at least two children, on Saturday in Gaza, hospital staff said, while a new effort at ceasefire talks was underway in Qatar after nearly 15 months of war.",
      "Thousands rallied again in Israel to press for a ceasefire deal, hours after Hamas released a video showing one of the hostages still held in Gaza. Such videos, like an uptick in airstrikes, have been seen as attempts to assert pressure during talks.",
      "A small boy cried over his father in southern Gaza's Khan Younis, and a woman draped herself over one of the bodies wrapped in white plastic. Three airstrikes in the city hit a car, a house and people on the street, according to staff at Nasser Hospital.",
      "The Civil Defense, first responders affiliated with the Hamas-run government, said an airstrike destroyed a residential area behind the Saraya complex in Gaza City, killing at least five people.",
      "And Israeli strikes on Saturday evening killed three people in Bureij and three others in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, where the bodies were taken. One child was among the dead. A young man leaned against a hospital wall and wept.",
      "Israel's military said it targeted Hamas militants with a strike near Salah al-Din in southern Gaza overnight and with a strike on a vehicle in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza. It also said Hamas fired a projectile that hit near the Erez crossing into Gaza.",
      "Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry said at least 59 people had been killed and more than 270 others were wounded by strikes in the past 24 hours.",
      "There were no immediate statements on the indirect negotiations toward a ceasefire. The talks have repeatedly stalled as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vows to press on in Gaza until Hamas is destroyed. Fighters with Hamas, which wants Israeli forces out of Gaza completely, continue to regroup in areas where Israeli forces withdraw.",
      "The talks are mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the United States, which plans a $8 billion weapons sale to Israel, U.S. officials say.",
      "The war is by far the deadliest round of fighting between Israel and Hamas. It began when Hamas and other militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 hostages are still in Gaza, at least a third believed to be dead.",
      "Families of hostages and others have rallied weekly to press Netanyahu to reach a ceasefire deal that would bring loved ones home, saying time is running out. At Saturday night's rally in Tel Aviv, police carried away some protesters who staged a sit-in on a street.",
      "In a video released by Hamas before the latest rally, Israeli soldier and hostage Liri Albag, speaking under duress, expressed anguish over her situation and mentioned being held 450 days.",
      "\u201cToday is the beginning of a new year; the whole world is celebrating. Only we are entering a dark year, a year of loneliness,\u201d she said. She also said a fellow captive had been wounded by the fighting in Gaza, adding, \u201cWe are living in an extremely terrifying nightmare.\u201d She didn't name the injured person.",
      "Netanyahu's office said he spoke with Albag's parents and told them that \u201cefforts are ongoing, including at this very moment\u201d to bring hostages home. Albag's family in a statement said that \u201cIt\u2019s time to make decisions as if your own children were there!\u201d",
      "Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive has killed at least 45,717 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the territory\u2019s Health Ministry, which says women and children make up more than half the dead. The ministry doesn\u2019t distinguish between civilians and combatants in its tally. It says uncounted bodies remain beneath rubble or in areas where emergency responders can't reach.",
      "Israel\u2019s military says it only targets militants and blames Hamas for civilian deaths, because its fighters operate in dense residential areas. The army says it has killed 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.",
      "The war has caused widespread destruction and displaced about 90% of Gaza\u2019s population of 2.3 million, many of them multiple times. Winter has now arrived, and hundreds of thousands are sheltering in tents near the sea. A small number of children have died from exposure to the cold.",
      "Gaza's Health Ministry said in a statement that Indonesian Hospital was no longer operational after Israeli operations in the area, and said all public hospitals in the north, largely isolated by a monthslong Israeli offensive, were now out of service. Access to the north is heavily restricted and claims can be difficult to verify.",
      "Meanwhile, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, relatives mourned an 18-year-old Palestinian who the Palestinian Health Ministry said was killed Friday during clashes with Israel\u2019s army in the Balata refugee camp in Nablus. The ministry said that nine other people were wounded.",
      "Palestinian health officials have said Israeli raids throughout the West Bank since Oct. 7, 2023, have killed more than 800 Palestinians. Israel says most of these are militants, but youths throwing stones and people not involved in confrontations have also been killed.",
      "A fragile ceasefire between Israel and Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has held up for more than a month, although its terms seem unlikely to be met by the agreed-upon 60-day deadline. Israel and Hezbollah had exchanged fire almost daily since the war in Gaza began.",

      "Maritime Enforcement Agency chief Mohamad Rosli Abdullah said in a statement that assistance has been provided to the two boats, including food supplies and and drinking water, before they were escorted out of the country to continue their journey. It didn't say where the boats were heading, and no further details were given.",
      "There were also no details about where they came from, but many Rohingya living in refugee camps in Bangladesh have been lured by traffickers to leave to seek a better life elsewhere.",
      "Bangladesh hosts more than 1 million Rohingya refugees who fled ethnic and religious violence in Myanmar. Malaysia is a popular destination because of its dominant Malay Muslim population.",
      "Many Rohingya fled a brutal counterinsurgency campaign in 2017 by Myanmar\u2019s security forces, who were accused of committing mass rapes and killings.",
      "While Malaysia has accepted Rohingya in the past on humanitarian grounds, the country has tried to limit numbers because of fears of a mass influx of people arriving on boats.",
      "As of the end of November, there were around 111,410 Rohingya refugees and asylum-seekers registered with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Malaysia. This makes up about 58% of the total refugee population in Malaysia."

      "BEIRUT -- A fragile ceasefire between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has held up for over a month, even as its terms seem unlikely to be met by the agreed-upon deadline.",
      "The deal struck on Nov. 27 to halt the war required Hezbollah to immediately lay down its arms in southern Lebanon and gave Israel 60 days to withdraw its forces there and hand over control to the Lebanese army and U.N. peacekeepers.",
      "So far, Israel has withdrawn from just two of the dozens of towns it holds in southern Lebanon. And it has continued striking what it says are bases belonging to Hezbollah, which it accuses of attempting to launch rockets and move weapons before they can be confiscated and destroyed.",
      "Hezbollah, which was severely diminished during nearly 14 months of war, has threatened to resume fighting if Israel does not fully withdraw its forces by the 60-day deadline.",
      "Yet despite accusations from both sides about hundreds of ceasefire violations, the truce is likely to hold, analysts say. That is good news for thousands of Israeli and Lebanese families displaced by the war still waiting to return home.",
      "\u201cThe ceasefire agreement is rather opaque and open to interpretation,\u201d said Firas Maksad, a senior fellow with the Middle East Institute in Washington. That flexibility, he said, may give it a better chance of holding in the face of changing circumstances, including the ouster of Syria's longtime leader, Bashar Assad, just days after the ceasefire took effect.",
      "With Assad gone, Hezbollah lost a vital route for smuggling weapons from Iran. While that further weakened Hezbollah\u2019s hand, Israel had already agreed to the U.S.-brokered ceasefire.",
      "Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023 \u2014 the day after Hamas launched a deadly attack into Israel that ignited the ongoing war in Gaza. Since then, Israeli air and ground assaults have killed more than 4,000 people in Lebanon, including hundreds of civilians. At the height of the war, more than 1 million Lebanese people were displaced.",
      "Hezbollah rockets forced some 60,000 from their homes in northern Israel, and killed 76 people in Israel, including 31 soldiers. Almost 50 Israeli soldiers were killed during operations inside Lebanon.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the terms of the ceasefire and its prospects for ending hostilities over the long-term.",
      "The agreement says that both Hezbollah and Israel will halt \u201coffensive\u201d military actions, but that they can act in self-defense, although it is not entirely clear how that term may be interpreted.",
      "The Lebanese army is tasked with preventing Hezbollah and other militant groups from launching attacks into Israel. It is also required to dismantle Hezbollah facilities and weapons in southern Lebanon \u2014 activities that might eventually be expanded to the rest of Lebanon, although it is not explicit in the ceasefire agreement.",
      "The United States, France, Israel, Lebanon and the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, are responsible for overseeing implementation of the agreement.",
      "\u201cThe key question is not whether the deal will hold, but what version of it will be implemented,\u201d Maksad, the analyst, said.",
      "Hezbollah has for the most part halted its rocket and drone fire into Israel, and Israel has stopped attacking Hezbollah in most areas of Lebanon. But Israel has launched regular airstrikes on what it says are militant sites in southern Lebanon and in the Bekaa Valley.",
      "Israeli forces have so far withdrawn from two towns in southern Lebanon - Khiam and Shamaa. They remain in some 60 others, according to the International Organization for Migration, and around 160,000 Lebanese remain displaced.",
      "Lebanon has accused Israel of repeatedly violating the ceasefire agreement and last week submitted a complaint to the U.N. Security Council that says Israel launched some 816 \u201cground and air attacks\u201d between the start of the ceasefire and Dec. 22, 2023.",
      "The complaint said the attacks have hindered the Lebanese army's efforts to deploy in the south and uphold its end of the ceasefire agreement.",
      "Israel says Hezbollah has violated the ceasefire hundreds of times and has also complained to the Security Council. It accused Hezbollah militants of moving ammunition, attempting to attack Israeli soldiers, and preparing and launching rockets towards northern Israel, among other things.",
      "Until it hands over control of more towns to the Lebanese army, Israeli troops have been destroying Hezbollah infrastructure, including weapons warehouses and underground tunnels. Lebanese authorities say Israel has also destroyed civilian houses and infrastructure.",
      "Israel's withdrawal from Lebanese towns has been slower than anticipated because of a lack of Lebanese army troops ready to take over, according to Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, a military spokesman. Lebanon disputes this, and says it is waiting for Israel to withdraw before entering the towns.",
      "Shoshani said Israel is satisfied with the Lebanese army's control of the areas it has already withdrawn from, and that while it would prefer a faster transfer of power, security is its most important objective.",
      "Israel does not consider the 60-day timetable for withdrawal to be \u201csacred,\u201d said Harel Chorev, an expert on Israel-Lebanon relations at Tel Aviv University who estimates that Lebanon will need to recruit and deploy thousands more troops before Israel will be ready to hand over control.",
      "Hezbollah officials have said that if Israeli forces remain in Lebanon 60 days past the start of the ceasefire, the militant group might return to attacking them. But Hezbollah Secretary General Naim Kassem said Wednesday that, for now, the group is holding off to give the Lebanese state a chance to \"take responsibility\u201d for enforcing the agreement.",
      "Over the final two months of the war, Hezbollah suffered major blows to its leadership, weapons and forces from a barrage of Israeli airstrikes, and a ground invasion that led to fierce battles in southern Lebanon. The fall of Assad was another big setback.",
      "\u201cThe power imbalance suggests Israel may want to ensure greater freedom of action after the 60-day period,\u201d Maksad, the analyst, said. And Hezbollah, in its weakened position, now has a \u201cstrong interest\u201d in making sure the deal doesn't fall apart altogether \u201cdespite Israeli violations,\u201d he said.",
      "While Hezbollah may not be in a position to return to open war with Israel, it or other groups could mount guerilla attacks using light weaponry if Israeli troops remain in southern Lebanon, said former Lebanese army Gen. Hassan Jouni. And even if Israel does withdraw all of its ground forces, Jouni said, the Israeli military could could continue to carry out sporadic airstrikes in Lebanon, much as it has done in Syria for years."

      "BANGKOK -- Myanmar\u2019s military government will release more than 6,000 prisoners and has reduced other inmates\u2019 sentences as part of a mass amnesty on Saturday marking the 77th anniversary of independence from Britain.",
      "It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if those released would include any of the thousands of political detainees locked up for opposing army rule since the military seized power in February 2021 from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. That takeover was met with massive nonviolent resistance, which has since become a widespread armed struggle.",
      "State-run MRTV television reported that Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the head of the military government, granted amnesties covering 5,864 prisoners from Myanmar, as well as 180 foreigners who will be deported. Mass prisoner releases are common on holidays and other significant occasions in Myanmar.",
      "The foreigners to be released could include four Thai fishermen who were arrested by Myanmar\u2019s navy in late November after patrol boats opened fire on Thai fishing vessels in waters close to their maritime border in the Andaman Sea. Thailand's prime minister has said she expects the four to be released on Independence Day.",
      "The terms of release warn that if the freed detainees violate the law again, they will have to serve the remainder of their original sentences in addition to any new sentence.",
      "In a separate report, it said Min Aung Hlaing had commuted the life sentences of 144 prisoners to 15 years imprisonment. The report provided no details about them.",
      "The report also said that all other prisoners will have their sentences reduced by one sixth, except those convicted under the Explosive Substances Act, the Unlawful Associations Act, the Arms Act and the Counter-terrorism Law, all laws which are often used against opponent military rule.",
      "Myanmar did not release many details of the prisoners being freed, but many were held on charges related to protests, including Section 505(A) of Myanmar\u2019s penal code, which makes it a crime to spread comments that create public unrest or fear or spread false news.",
      "Prisoner releases began on Saturday but can take a few days to be completed. At Insein Prison in the country\u2019s biggest city of Yangon, which is notorious for decades for housing political detainees, relatives of prisoners gathered at the gates from early morning.",
      "There was no sign that the prisoner release would include Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been held virtually incommunicado by the military since its seizer of power.",
      "The 79-year-old Suu Kyi is serving a 27-year sentence after being convicted of a series of politically tinged prosecutions brought by the military.",
      "Her supporters and independent analysts say the cases against her are an attempt to discredit her and legitimize the military\u2019s seizure of power while keeping her from taking part in the military\u2019s promised election, for which no date has yet been set.",
      "According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a rights monitoring organization, 28,096 people have been arrested on political charges since the army takeover.",
      "Of those arrested, 21,499 people were still in detention as of Friday, the AAPP reported. At least 6,106 civilians have been killed by security forces in the same period, the group says. Its tally does not include all casualties from combat.",
      "Myanmar became a British colony in the late 19th century and regained its independence on Jan. 4, 1948.",
      "In the capital Naypyitaw, Myanmar\u2019s military government celebrated the anniversary with a flag-raising ceremony at City Hall."

      "The fate of an Italian journalist detained in Tehran and an Iranian engineer imprisoned in Italy on a U.S. warrant have grown even more intertwined",
      "ROME -- Iran warned Italy on Friday that it risked harming good bilateral relations if it bows to the \u201cpolitical and hostile goals\u201d of the United States by detaining an Iranian engineer on a U.S. warrant in connection with a drone attack in Jordan last year that killed three American troops.",
      "Tehran issued the warning to the Italian ambassador to Iran, Paola Amadei, who was summoned to the foreign ministry, the official IRNA news agency reported. The meeting took place a day after Italy summoned the Iranian ambassador over the detention of an Italian journalist in Tehran.",
      "The back-to-back diplomatic summonses underscored how a three-nation tangle over the fates of the two prisoners was getting ever more complicated for Italy, which is a historic ally of Washington but maintains traditionally good relations with Tehran.",
      "Mohammad Abedini was arrested by Italian authorities at Milan\u2019s Malpensa airport on Dec. 16 on a U.S. warrant. The U.S. Justice Department accused him and another Iranian of supplying the drone technology to Iran that was used in a January 2024 attack on a U.S. outpost in Jordan that killed three American troops.",
      "Three days later, an Italian reporter for the Il Foglio daily, Cecilia Sala, was detained in Tehran. She had arrived in the country on Dec. 13 on a journalist visa and was arrested on charges of violating the laws of the Islamic Republic, IRNA said.",
      "Italian commentators have speculated that Iran is holding Sala as a bargaining chip to ensure Abedini\u2019s release, and both governments have linked their fates to one another in public statements.",
      "According to IRNA, a foreign ministry official, Majid Nili Ahmadabadi, told Amadei that Rome's continued detention of Abedini was an \u201cillegal act that is done based on the U.S. demand and in line with the political and hostile goals of the country to hold Iranian nationals hostage in various points in the world.\"",
      "Nili demanded the release of Abedini as soon as possible to \u201cprevent damage to the Tehran-Rome bilateral relations by the U.S.\u201d",
      "As a result, all eyes will be on the Milan court of appeals, which scheduled a hearing for Jan. 15 to decide whether to keep Abedini at Milan\u2019s Opera prison or grant him house arrest pending the start of the lengthy extradition process to the U.S.",
      "The U.S. government hasn't commented publicly on Abedini's petition, but in the past it has complained to Italy's justice ministry about a half-dozen cases of suspects wanted by the U.S. who escaped from the Italian justice system before they could be extradited.",
      "On Friday, Abedini's lawyer, Alfredo De Francesco visited his client in prison and said he had asked him about Sala. He said Abedini had heard about Sala\u2019s case inside the prison and didn\u2019t understand any connection to him.",
      "\u201cHe asked me if she had been arrested and how she had been arrested, and why in some way they wanted to connect her to him,\u201d the lawyer said. \u201cI explained the situation to him, even what is said on television, because it is useless to deny it, but I explained to him.\u201d",
      "The lawyer stressed that on the surface the two cases are separate but said Abedini was emotional in hearing about her plight.",
      "\u201cHe asked me to write the name of Cecilia Sala on a piece of paper we had with pen, so that he could correctly pronounce her name,\u201d De Francesco told reporters outside the prison. \u201cHe was very moved by this thing, to know that she is a woman in prison right now, and so he prays for her, for him.\u201d",
      "U.S. federal prosecutors charged Abedini and his co-defendant with export control violations after FBI specialists analyzed the drone navigation system used in the Jordan attack and traced it to them. U.S. prosecutors said Abedini\u2019s Tehran-based company manufactures navigation systems for the military drone program of Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.",
      "Iran\u2019s embassy to Italy has connected Sala\u2019s fate to that of Abedini, saying in a statement posted to X that it will respect Sala\u2019s rights and expects Italy to do the same for Abedini.",
      "The delicate diplomatic triangle poses something of a headache for the government of Premier Giorgia Meloni, which is still stinging from the embarrassment of having lost track of another high-profile target wanted by the U.S.",
      "Russian businessman Artyom Uss, wanted by the U.S. on alleged sanctions violations, escaped from Italy in 2022 after he was granted house arrest, despite warnings from the U.S. that he was a flight risk.",
      "Uss, the son of a Russian regional governor, later resurfaced in Russia. Meloni acknowledged at the time that there were grave \u201canomalies\u201d in the handling of his case and ordered an investigation.",
      "Milan\u2019s general prosecutor, Francesca Nanni, has opposed Abedini\u2019s motion for house arrest, saying he\u2019s a flight risk and that not even guarantees from Iran\u2019s consulate in Milan were sufficient to ensure he wouldn\u2019t disappear.",
      "The issue could come up next week when Meloni hosts President Joe Biden on his final foreign trip before leaving office.",
      "Traditionally, Iran has enjoyed calm diplomatic relations with Italy compared to other European nations such as Britain, France and Germany. Those countries routinely accuse Tehran of supplying short-range ballistic missiles to Russia and producing weapon-grade uranium, charges Iran denies.",

      "LONDON -- A senior British politician pushed back Friday on Elon Musk's criticism of the government's handling of a historic child grooming scandal.",
      "In recent days, Musk has shared and reacted to posts on his X platform that have been critical of the British government after it rejected a call for a public inquiry into the grooming scandal in the north of England town of Oldham.",
      "Though Health Secretary Wes Streeting said Musk's views were was \"misjudged and certainly misinformed,\u201d he urged the world's richest man and close confidant of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to work with the government on tackling the issue of child sexual exploitation.",

      "Musk has also targeted British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who he claimed had failed to bring what many term \u201crape gangs\u201d to justice when he was the director of public prosecutions between 2008 and 2013. The scandals, Musk said Friday, represent a \u201cmassive crime against humanity.\u201d",

      "\u201cSome of the criticisms that Elon Musk has made, I think are misjudged and certainly misinformed, but we\u2019re willing to work with Elon Musk, who I think has got a big role to play with his social media platform to help us and other countries to tackle this serious issue,\" Streeting said. \"So if he wants to work with us and roll his sleeves up, we\u2019d welcome that.\u201d",

      "As well as offering his thoughts, Musk is apparently interested in putting his money where his mouth is by funding Reform U.K., a right-wing party led by Nigel Farage, who is Trump\u2019s highest-profile British champion, to the tune of 100 million pounds ($124 million).",

    "story": [
      "President Joe Biden is set to sign into law a measure that boosts Social Security payments for current and former public employees",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden on Sunday plans to sign into law a measure that boosts Social Security payments for current and former public employees, affecting nearly 3 million people who receive pensions from their time as teachers, firefighters, police officers and in other public service jobs.",
      "Advocates say the Social Security Fairness Act rights a decades-old disparity, though it will also put strain on Social Security Trust Funds, which face a looming insolvency crisis.",
      "The bill rescinds two provisions \u2014 the Windfall Elimination Provision and the Government Pension Offset \u2014 that limit Social Security benefits for recipients if they get retirement payments from other sources, including public retirement programs from a state or local government.",
      "The Congressional Research Service estimated that in December 2023, there were 745,679 people, about 1% of all Social Security beneficiaries, who had their benefits reduced by the Government Pension Offset. About 2.1 million people, or about 3% of all beneficiaries, were affected by the Windfall Elimination Provision.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office estimated in September that eliminating the Windfall Elimination Provision would boost monthly payments to the affected beneficiaries by an average of $360 by December 2025. Ending the Government Pension Offset would increase monthly benefits in December 2025 by an average of $700 for 380,000 recipients getting benefits based on living spouses, according to the CBO. The increase would be an average of $1,190 for 390,000 or surviving spouses getting a widow or widower benefit.",
      "Those amounts would increase over time with Social Security\u2019s regular cost-of-living adjustments.",
      "The change is to payments from January 2024 and beyond, meaning the Social Security Administration would owe back-dated payments. The measure as passed by Congress says the Social Security commissioner \"shall adjust primary insurance amounts to the extent necessary to take into account\u201d changes in the law. It's not immediately clear how this will happen or whether people affected will have to take any action.",
      "Edward Kelly, president of the International Association of Fire Fighters, said firefighters across the country are \u201cexcited to see the change \u2014 we've righted a 40-year wrong.\u201d Kelly said the policy was \u201cfar more egregious for surviving spouses of firefighters who paid their own quotas into Social Security but were victimized by the government pension system.\u201d",
      "The IAFF has roughly 320,000 members, which does not include hundreds of thousands of retirees who will benefit from the change.",
      "\u201cNow firefighters who get paid very little can now afford to actually retire,\" Kelly said.",
      "Sherrod Brown, who as an Ohio senator pushed for the proposal for years, lost his reelection bid in November. Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees labor union, thanked Brown for his advocacy.",
      "\u201cOver two million public service workers will finally be able to access the Social Security benefits they spent their careers paying into,\" Saunders said in a statement. \"Many will finally be able to enjoy retirement after a lifetime of service.\u201d",
      "National Education Association President Becky Pringle said the law is \u201ca historic victory that will improve the lives of educators, first responders, postal workers and others who dedicate their lives to public service in their communities.\u201d",
      "And while some Republicans such as Maine Sen. Susan Collins supported the legislation, others, including Sens. John Thune of South Dakota, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, voted against it. \u201cWe caved to the pressure of the moment instead of doing this on a sustainable basis,\u201d Tillis told The Associated Press last month.",
      "Still, Republican supporters of the bill said there was a rare opportunity to address what they described as an unfair section of federal law that hurts public service retirees.",

      "The Venezuelan opposition leader who the United States recognized as the winner of last year's presidential election has kicked off a tour of Latin America",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Venezuelan opposition leader Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, who the United States recognized as the winner of last year's presidential election, kicked off a tour of Latin America on Saturday, just days before President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro is set to be sworn in for a third term in defiance of international pressure.",
      "A crowd of a few hundred Venezuelan migrants broke into shouts of \u201cEdmundo, Presidente\u201d as Gonz\u00e1lez emerged from a meeting with Argentine President Javier Milei to wave to supporters from the balcony of the iconic Casa Rosada, or Pink House, in Buenos Aires.",
      "\u201cWe are doing whatever the cause of freedom requires,\u201d Milei, an effusive far-right supporter of the Venezuelan opposition, said as he welcomed Gonz\u00e1lez to the presidential palace with honors normally reserved for a head of state.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez, a retired diplomat, fled into exile in Spain in September after a judge issued an arrest warrant following the July 28 presidential election, in which Maduro was declared the winner by the National Electoral Council, which is stacked with governing party loyalists.",
      "In recent weeks, he has been vowing to travel to Venezuela to be sworn in for the presidential term, which according to law must begin on Jan. 10. But he hasn't said how he plans to return or wrest power from Maduro, whose party controls all institutions and the military.",
      "On Thursday, Maduro\u2019s government raised the stakes even further, announcing a $100,000 reward for information on Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s whereabouts and plastering the wanted-like bulletin with the retired diplomat's photo on social media and the arrivals board at the country's main airport.",
      "Upon arrival to the Argentine capital, where he twice served as Venezuela\u2019s ambassador more than two decades ago, Gonz\u00e1lez posted on social media a short video message expressing solidarity with those imprisoned in Venezuela as part of a crackdown by Maduro.",
      "He said that he would raise with Milei concerns about the well-being of five Maduro opponents who have been sheltering in the Argentine ambassador\u2019s residence in Caracas for nearly 10 months \u2014 a diplomatic standoff that has embittered relations between Venezuela and Argentina.",
      "The Biden administration and most European governments have rejected the election's official results, pointing out that authorities didn't provide detailed results as they have in past elections. Meanwhile, copies of tally sheets collected by the opposition from 85% of the nation\u2019s electronic voting machines show that Gonz\u00e1lez prevailed by a more than two-to-one margin.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez, 75, was a previously unknown career diplomat when he was thrust into rallying the anti-Maduro coalition as a last-minute stand-in for opposition stalwart Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, whom the government banned from running for office.",
      "After speaking with Milei on Saturday, Gonz\u00e1lez is scheduled to cross the Rio de la Plata for a meeting with Uruguayan President Luis Lacalle Pou."

      "LOS ANGELES -- Nick Khan's prediction becomes a reality on Monday night.",
      "The World Wrestling Entertainment executive said during earning calls in the past that he saw a day when Netflix would continue to evolve and enter into live programming, much to the consternation of Netflix officials.",
      "However, Khan saw the hires that Netflix was making along with the streaming service's offerings that could appeal to all family members.",
      "Now, one of those offerings is the WWE.",
      "The 1,650th episode of \u201cMonday Night Raw\u201d from the Intuit Dome outside of Los Angeles officially kicks off WWE's 10-year partnership with Netflix. The agreement, reached last January, is worth in excess of $5 billion with an option for Netflix to extend for an additional 10 years or opt out after five.",
      "\u201cWe try to appeal the WWE to all 50 states and to countries globally. We think Netflix does the same thing,\" said Khan, who is WWE\u2019s president.",
      "Netflix \u2014 which has 282.3 million subscribers in more than 190 countries \u2014 becomes the exclusive home of \u201cRaw\u201d in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and Latin America, with additional countries to be added over time. The bigger component for Netflix though, is that the streaming platform will carry all of the company\u2019s shows overseas \u2014 including \u201cSmackdown\u201d and \u201cNXT\u201d \u2014 as well as premium live events like WrestleMania, SummerSlam and Royal Rumble.",
      "In the U.S., \u201cSmackdown\u201d moved to USA Network from Fox and \u201cNXT\u201d from USA to the CW three months ago. Peacock has a contract to carry WWE's premium live events through March 2026.",
      "\u201cRaw\u201d began airing on Jan. 11, 1993, and is the longest running weekly episodic series on television. Most of that time had been on USA Network with a run on Spike TV, now known as Paramount Network.",
      "\u201cIt has great storytelling, characters along with memorable and surprising stories. And the idea of combining this kind of intense fandom with these characters and our reach globally just seemed like such a great opportunity,\u201d said Bela Bajaria, Netflix\u2019s chief content officer. \u201cWhat we also love is the multigenerational fan base. At the end of the day, we have great things that our members love and this totally delivers on all of the things that we want. And to do it 52 weeks a year is super exciting.\"",
      "WWE's global reach has expanded during the past year, with nearly half of its premium live events taking place overseas. The company will also embark on an extended tour of Europe in March to build momentum for WrestleMania 41, which takes place in Las Vegas April 19 and 20.",
      "Khan said WWE first approached Netflix about its rights in 2018, but Netflix wasn't ready to begin carrying live events. The streaming service has ramped up its efforts during the past year, not only with sports events, but with Chris Rock's comedy special and the roast of Tom Brady.",
      "Brandon Riegg, Netflix\u2019s vice president of nonfiction series and sports, said the social media buzz around \u201cRaw\u201d each week as well as the stable audience WWE provides made it a natural fit this time when the company approached Netflix last year.",
      "In turn, Riegg thinks Netflix can help expand WWE's audience the way it did with Formula 1 and the \u201cDrive to Survive\u201d series.",
      "\u201cIt really was just fitting in to the whole picture of we\u2019re going to do these big events like the Tyson-Paul fight and the NFL on Christmas,\" he said. \"But then throughout the year, if we can have a steady drumbeat of those amazing live moments and live action and spectacle, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to get with WWE.\u201d",
      "According to Nielsen, \u201cRaw's\u201d final episode on USA Network averaged 1.6 million viewers despite going against the \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d matchup between the Detroit Lions and San Francisco 49ers.",
      "Khan and WWE chief content officer Paul \u201cTriple H\u201d Levesque have also stressed that the three-hour weekly show will not hurt its rating due to being on a streaming platform. \u201cRaw\u201d was known for toeing the line on risky content during the late 1990s in what WWE called the \u201cAttitude Era,\u201d but that has changed over the years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not pushing anybody away of what they want. It\u2019s a safe place for families and everybody to be able to view. That will not change, but you don\u2019t have to change that to expand and improve what you do,\u201d Levesque said.",
      "WWE's storytelling and character development continues to excel even during external challenges. Former chairman Vince McMahon resigned last January after a lawsuit claiming sexual misconduct. In 2023, WWE was bought by Endeavor and merged with Ultimate Fighting Championship to create TKO Group Holdings.",
      "According to WWE, there were 44 sellouts for TV shows and 66 overall, including house shows and premium live events, in 2024.",
      "WWE champion Cody Rhodes credited Khan and Levesque for keeping the company on track, along with scaling back on some of the non-televised live events to make sure top talent does not get burned out during the year.",
      "Levesque said Monday's show will be on the level of a premium live event. John Cena, who is retiring from WWE at the end of the year, begins his farewell tour with three main event matches on tap. It also wouldn't be a shock if Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson makes an appearance.",
      "Roman Reigns, who will take part in one of the main event matches, said he is always trying to put his best foot forward, but he also knows how big Monday night is for the company.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no hiding that this is Netflix and this is huge and this is going to be on a global platform with a lot of people watching. I\u2019m not sure exactly what that audience is going to look like. It\u2019s going to be crazy, I know that.\"",

      "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a top oil and gas industry trade group are suing Vermont over its new law requiring that fossil fuel companies pay a share of the damage caused over several decades by climate change.",
      "The federal lawsuit filed Monday asks a state court to prevent Vermont from enforcing the law, which was passed last year. Vermont became the first state in the country to enact the law after it suffered catastrophic summer flooding and damage from other extreme weather. The state is working to estimate the cost of climate change dating back to Jan. 1, 1995.",
      "The lawsuit argues the U.S. Constitution precludes the act and that the state law is preempted by the federal Clean Air Act. It also argues that the law violates domestic and foreign commerce clauses by discriminating \u201cagainst the important interest of other states by targeting large energy companies located outside of Vermont.\u201d",
      "The Chamber and the other plaintiff in the lawsuit, the American Petroleum Institute, argue that the federal government is already addressing climate change. And because greenhouse gases come from billions of individual sources, they argue it is impossible to measure \u201caccurately and fairly\u201d the impact of emissions from a particular entity in a particular location over decades.",
      "\u201cVermont wants to impose massive retroactive penalties going back 30 years for lawful, out-of-state conduct that was regulated by Congress under the Clean Air Act,\" said Tara Morrissey, senior vice president and deputy chief counsel of the Chamber\u2019s litigation center. \u201cThat is unlawful and violates the structure of the U.S. Constitution \u2014 one state can\u2019t try to regulate a global issue best left to the federal government. Vermont\u2019s penalties will ultimately raise costs for consumers in Vermont and across the country.\u201d",
      "A spokesman for the state's Agency of Natural Resources said it had not been formally served with this lawsuit.",
      "Anthony Iarrapino, a Vermont-based lobbyist with the Conservation Law Foundation, said the lawsuit was the fossil fuel industry's way of \u201ctrying to avoid accountability for the damage their products have caused in Vermont and beyond.\u201d",
      "\u201cMore states are following Vermont\u2019s lead holding Big Oil accountable for the disaster recovery and cleanup costs from severe storms fueled by climate change, ensuring that families and businesses no longer have to foot the entire bill time and time again,\" Iarrapino added.",
      "Under the law, the Vermont state treasurer, in consultation with the Agency of Natural Resources, is to issue a report by Jan. 15, 2026, on the total cost to Vermonters and the state from the emission of greenhouse gases from Jan. 1, 1995, to Dec. 31, 2024. The assessment would look at the effects on public health, natural resources, agriculture, economic development, housing and other areas. The state would use federal data to determine the amount of covered greenhouse gas emissions attributed to a fossil fuel company.",
      "It\u2019s a polluter-pays model affecting companies engaged in the trade or business of extracting fossil fuel or refining crude oil attributable to more than 1 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions during the time period. The funds could be used by the state for such things as improving stormwater drainage systems; upgrading roads, bridges and railroads; relocating, elevating or retrofitting sewage treatment plants; and making energy efficient weatherization upgrades to public and private buildings. It\u2019s modeled after the federal Superfund pollution cleanup program.",
      "The approach taken by Vermont has drawn interest from other states, including New York, where Gov. Kathy Hochul signed into law a similar bill in December.",
      "The New York law requires companies responsible for substantial greenhouse gas emissions to pay into a state fund for infrastructure projects meant to repair or avoid future damage from climate change. The biggest emitters of greenhouse gases between 2000 and 2018 would be subjected to the fines."

That decision was confirmed by New York Supreme Court Justice Andrew Borrok the following month.",

      "The agency said it\u2019s the first time it has fined an airline for chronic delays on specific routes, which it blamed on \u201cunrealistic scheduling\u201d by JetBlue.",
      "\u201cIllegal chronic flight delays make flying unreliable for travelers. Today\u2019s action puts the entire airline industry on notice that we expect their flight schedules to reflect reality,\u201d Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said.

      "ASHEVILLE, N.C. -- New North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein took several actions on Thursday to help the short- and long-term recovery from Hurricane Helene, with an immediate focus on more temporary housing and repairs to private bridges and roads.",
      "Stein, who took his oath of office on Wednesday to succeed fellow Democrat Roy Cooper, traveled to Asheville and \u2014 with legislators and officials from both parties behind him \u2014 announced he had signed five executive orders related to the historic flooding in late September in western North Carolina.",

      "Over 100 people died in North Carolina because of Helene, which state officials estimate caused a record $59.6 billion in damages and recovery needs. Billions of dollars from the federal and state government already have been spent or earmarked for the recovery, and Congress last month committed at least another $9 billion in aid. But more must be done this winter to put more people in warm and safe housing on their own property, and to restore vital transportation links between small communities as well as first responders and school buses, Stein said.",
      "One executive order allows the state Department of Public Safety to purchase up to 1,000 temporary housing units through the end of next month without going through the usual state procurement and bidding processes. Stein said the Federal Emergency Management Agency is covering the costs of these units. FEMA is already following another regulatory process as it installs similar trailers on its own, he added.",
      "Stein also delegated to the Division of Emergency Management the ability to hire repair contractors for private bridges and roads without procurement requirements. It also lets environmental regulators waive rules to speed up permitting and inspections.",

      "Another Stein order creates a new Governor\u2019s Recovery Office for Western North Carolina and establishes within the Commerce Department a Division of Community Revitalization that in part will oversee the rebuilding of homes destroyed or damaged by Helene.",
      "The North Carolina Office of Recovery and Resiliency, which was created during Cooper's administration, will stick to rebuilding homes in eastern North Carolina harmed by Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Florence in 2018, Stein said. Republicans in charge of the General Assembly have been angry with the pace of the agency's work and a fiscal shortfall for ongoing housing projects.",
      "Stein also issued an order giving many state employees more paid leave this year to volunteer for Helene-related recovery efforts, and he agreed to continue a Helene recovery advisory committee that he created after his November election victory. GOP state Sen. Kevin Corbin, who has co-chaired the panel with Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer, said Thursday that Stein's actions were \u201cbipartisan commonsense solutions.\"",
      "New State Auditor Dave Boliek, also a Republican, released a statement later Thursday telling Stein that his department would hold Stein's office accountable on how money stemming from the orders gets spent.",
      "\u201cGiven past failures to effectively provide hurricane relief to Eastern North Carolina, it is in the best interest of Hurricane Helene victims that our office takes such action,\" Boliek said."

      "\u201cThe stability of the system is fragile,\u201d Luma said late Wednesday as it warned of more outages on Thursday given an ongoing lack of generation. \u201cWe know and understand how frustrating it is for our clients to be without service for long periods of time.\u201d",
      "Backup generators were put in place to ensure a smooth swearing-in ceremony on Thursday given that renowned musicians were scheduled to perform.",
      "The anticipated revelry was characteristic of Gonz\u00e1lez, a 48-year-old attorney and recent mother of twins who prior to the election showed up at her party\u2019s assembly wearing a Wonder Woman tiara and cuffs. She also made the news after peeling out of one of her party\u2019s conventions in an off-road vehicle earlier this year.",
      "Supporters and critics gathered for the ceremony, some clutching umbrellas to shield themselves from the blistering sun.",
      "\u201cBecause she\u2019s a woman, she\u2019s going to be a great governor,\u201d said Amanda S\u00e1nchez Le\u00f3n, a retired government employee, who arrived two hours early to secure a spot outside an area reserved for guests. She said she was hopeful that Gonz\u00e1lez would reduce violent crimes and improve education and health, \u201cespecially for us older people.\u201d She also believed the power crisis would improve and that Gonz\u00e1lez would see her promises through.",

      "Gonz\u00e1lez, of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party, had beat former Gov. Pedro Pierluisi during their party\u2019s primary in June.",
      "At the time, she was Puerto Rico\u2019s representative in Congress and had run on Pierluisi\u2019s ticket four years ago.",
      "After beating him, she won the Nov. 5 general election with more than 526,000 votes, or 41%. Trailing her was Juan Dalmau, who represented Puerto Rico\u2019s Independence Party and the Citizen Victory Movement.",
      "It was the first time that the Popular Democratic Party, which supports the island\u2019s territorial status quo and is one of Puerto Rico\u2019s two main parties, came in third in a gubernatorial race.",
      "While Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s immediate challenge is Puerto Rico\u2019s fragile power grid, she also inherits a feeble economy that has slowly been strengthening since the U.S. territory\u2019s government declared in 2015 that it was unable to pay its more than $70 billion public debt load.",
      "In 2017, it filed for the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy in history.",
      "All but one government agency has since restructured its debt, with Puerto Rico\u2019s Electric Power Authority still struggling to do so. It holds more than $9 billion in debt, the largest of any government agency.",
      "Experts warn the island will keep struggling to attract investors until the debt is restructured and the power grid strengthened.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez also will have to work alongside a federal control board that U.S. Congress created in 2016 to oversee Puerto Rico\u2019s finances and supervise the ongoing reconstruction after Hurricane Mar\u00eda slammed into the island in September 2017 as a powerful Category 4 storm, razing the electrical grid.",
      "She also faces pressure to create affordable housing, lower power bills and the general cost of living, reduce violent crime, boost Puerto Rico\u2019s economy, with the island locked out of capital markets since 2015, and improve a limping health care system as thousands of doctors flock to the U.S. mainland.",
      "Like other governors of the pro-statehood party, Gonz\u00e1lez has said she would push for Puerto Rico to become the 51st state, but such a change would require approval from U.S. Congress and the U.S. president.",
      "A nonbinding referendum held during the Nov. 5 election, the seventh of its kind, asked voters to choose one of three options: statehood, independence and independence with free association, under which issues like foreign affairs, U.S. citizenship and use of the U.S. dollar would be negotiated.",
      "With 63% of voters participating, statehood earned more than 615,000 votes, or 59%, with independence coming in second for the first time with more than 309,000 votes, or 29%. Independence with free association garnered more than 128,000 votes, or 12%.",
      "While Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, they are not allowed to vote in presidential elections, and officials with the New Progressive Party have noted the island receives unequal treatment when it comes to Medicaid, Medicare and other federal programs.",
      "\u201cStatehood means equality, and I want us to have that access to opportunities,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez said. \u201cI want to have those opportunities here so that our people can move forward.\u201d"

      "Opponents of a huge lithium mine under construction in Nevada want U.S. officials to investigate whether the project already has caused a drop in groundwater levels that could lead to extinction of a tiny snail",
      "RENO, Nev. -- Opponents of the nation's largest lithium mine under construction want U.S. officials to investigate whether the project in Nevada already has caused a drop in groundwater levels that could lead to extinction of a tiny snail being considered for endangered species protection.",
      "Environmentalists and Native American activists are demanding that the U.S. Interior Department address what they say is new evidence that bolsters their concerns about Lithium Americas\u2019 planned open pit mine at Thacker Pass. The footprint of mine operations will span about 9 square miles (23 square kilometers).",
      "The fate of the snail takes center stage after a federal judge and an appeals court dismissed a previous attempt by Native American tribes to get federal agencies to recognize the sacred nature of the area. The tribes argued that the mine would infringe on lands where U.S. troops massacred dozens of their ancestors in 1865.",
      "Now, Western Watersheds Project and the group known as People of Red Mountain argue in a notice of intent to sue that the government and Canada-based Lithium Americas are failing to live up to promises to adequately monitor groundwater impacts.",
      "They say it\u2019s alarming that an analysis of groundwater data from a nearby well that was conducted by Payton Gardner, an assistant professor of hydrogeology at the University of Montana, shows a drop in the water table of nearly 5 feet (1.5 meters) since 2018. Nevada regulators say they have no information so far that would confirm declining levels but have vowed to monitor the situation during the mine's lifespan.",
      "Not much bigger than a grain of rice, the Kings River pyrg has managed to survive in 13 isolated springs within the basin surrounding the mine site. It\u2019s the only place in the world where the snail lives.",
      "In some cases, the tiny creatures require only a few centimeters of water. But the margin for survival becomes more narrow if the groundwater system that feeds the springs begins to drop, said Paul Ruprecht, Nevada Director for Western Watersheds Project.",
      "\u201cEven slight disruptions to its habitat could cause springs to run dry, driving it to extinction,\u201d he said.",
      "Western Watersheds Project and the other opponents say the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is violating the Endangered Species Act by failing to rule in a timely fashion on a 2022 petition to list the snail as threatened or endangered. The allegations outlined in the opponents' notice follow requests for federal biologists to investigate whether groundwater drawdowns are being caused by exploratory drilling and other activities and whether there have been impacts to the springs.",
      "Without protection, Ruprecht fears the snail \u201cwill become another casualty of the lithium boom.\u201d",
      "The Fish and Wildlife Service is conducting a review of the snail's status, but the agency declined to comment on the requests for an investigation into the groundwater concerns.",
      "Efforts to mine gold and other minerals in Nevada and other parts of the West over the decades have spurred plenty of legal skirmishes over potential threats to wildlife and water supplies. Lithium is no exception, as demand for the metal critical to making batteries for electric vehicles is expected to continue to climb exponentially over the next decade.",
      "President Joe Biden made increased production of electric vehicles central to his energy agenda, and the U.S. Energy Department last year agreed to loan Lithium Americas more than $2 billion to help finance construction at Thacker Pass. On Dec. 23, Lithium Americas announced it had concluded a joint venture with General Motors Holdings LLC to develop and operate the mine.",
      "The mine 200 miles (322 kilometers) north of Reno is the biggest in the works and closest to fruition in the U.S., followed by Ioneer\u2019s Rhyolite Ridge project near the California line halfway between Reno and Las Vegas.",
      "And the Bureau of Land Management announced in late December that it was seeking comments on another proposed project in northeastern Nevada. Surge Battery Metals USA wants to explore for lithium in Elko County.",
      "Ruprecht said reports filed by Lithium Americas\u2019 environmental consultant with state regulators show the company no longer has permission to access private lands where several monitoring wells are located. That makes it harder to tell if flows have been impacted by past drilling, he said.",
      "Nevada regulators say they approved changes in 2024 to the monitoring plan to account for the loss of access to wells on private land.",
      "Prior data showed groundwater levels had remained stable from the 1960s to 2018. Construction started at the site in 2023.",
      "The Bureau of Land Management\u2019s approval of the mine acknowledged some reduction in groundwater levels were possible but not for decades, and most likely would occur only if state regulators granted the company permission to dig below the water table.",
      "Lithium Americas spokesman Tim Crowley said it appears the mine\u2019s opponents are \u201cworking to re-spin issues that have previously been addressed and resolved in court.\u201d He pointed to 10 years of data collection by the company indicating the snail would not be affected by the project."

      "Such optimism, of course, can also make contrarians feel nervous.",
      "A measure of how heavily Wall Street analysts are recommending stocks is at its highest level since early 2022, according to Bank of America strategist Savita Subramanian.

      "Even as Russian troops and tanks moved into Ukraine in February 2022, Russian natural gas kept flowing through the country\u2019s pipeline network \u2014 set up when Ukraine and Russia were both part of the Soviet Union \u2014 to Europe, under a five-year agreement.",
      "Russia's state-owned energy giant Gazprom earned money from the gas and Ukraine collected transit fees.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s energy minister, Herman Halushchenko, confirmed Kyiv had stopped the transit \u201cin the interest of national security.\"",
      "\u201cThis is a historic event. Russia is losing markets and will incur financial losses,\" Halushchenko said Wednesday on the Telegram messaging app. \"Europe has already decided to phase out Russian gas, and (this) aligns with what Ukraine has done today.\u201d",
      "At a summit in Brussels last month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed that Kyiv would not allow Moscow to use the transits to earn \u201cadditional billions ... on our blood, on the lives of our citizens.\u201d However, he briefly held open the possibility of the gas flows continuing if payments to Russia were withheld until the war ends.",
      "Gazprom said in a statement Wednesday it \u201chas no technical and legal possibility\u201d of sending gas through Ukraine, due to Kyiv's refusal to extend the deal.",
      "Before the war, Russia supplied nearly 40% of the European Union's pipeline natural gas. Gas flowed through four pipeline systems, one under the Baltic Sea, one through Belarus and Poland, one through Ukraine and one under the Black Sea through Turkey to Bulgaria.",
      "After the war started, Russia cut off most supplies through the Baltic and Belarus-Poland pipelines, citing disputes over a demand for payment in rubles. The Baltic pipeline was blown up in an act of sabotage, but details of the attack remain murky.",
      "The Russian cutoff caused an energy crisis in Europe. Germany had to shell out billions of euros to set up floating terminals to import liquefied natural gas that comes by ship, not by pipeline. Users cut back as prices soared. Norway and the United States filled the gap, becoming the two largest suppliers.",
      "Europe viewed the Russian cutoff as energy blackmail and has outlined plans to completely eliminate Russian gas imports by 2027.",
      "Zelenskyy said Wednesday that halting the transits would see Moscow lose \u201cone of the most profitable and geographically accessible markets\u201d for its gas. In a post on X, he said Russia was \u201cresorting to cynical blackmail of partners.\u201d",
      "Russia's share of the EU pipeline natural gas market dropped sharply to about 8% in 2023, according to data from the EU Commission. The Ukrainian transit route served EU members Austria and Slovakia, which long got the bulk of their natural gas from Russia but have recently scrambled to diversify supplies.",
      "Gazprom halted supplies to Austria\u2019s OMV in mid-November over a contractual dispute, but gas flows through Ukraine\u2019s pipelines continued as other customers stepped in.

      "Among the hardest-hit will be EU candidate country Moldova, which was receiving Russian gas via Ukraine and has brought in emergency measures as residents brace for a harsh winter and looming power cuts.",
      "Separately from Kyiv's decision to let the transit deal expire, Gazprom said last month it will halt gas supplies to Moldova starting on Jan. 1, citing unpaid debt. Gazprom has said Moldova owes close to $709 million for past gas supplies, a figure the country has fiercely disputed.",
      "Heating and hot water supplies were abruptly cut off Wednesday to households in Transnistria, Moldova\u2019s breakaway region that has for decades hosted Russian troops, as Russian natural gas stopped flowing to the territory, local transit operator Tiraspoltransgaz-Transnistria said.",

      "A team of U.S. investigators including representatives from Boeing have examined the site of a plane crash that killed 179 people in South Korea",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- A team of U.S. investigators including representatives from Boeing on Tuesday examined the site of a plane crash that killed 179 people in South Korea while authorities were conducting safety inspections on all Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated by the country\u2019s airlines.",
      "All but two of the 181 people aboard the Boeing 737-800 operated by South Korean budget airline Jeju Air died in Sunday's crash. Video showed the aircraft, without its landing gear deployed, crash-landed on its belly and overshoot a runaway at South Korea\u2019s southern Muan International Airport before it slammed into concrete fence and burst into a flame.",
      "The plane was seen having an engine trouble, and preliminary examinations also say the pilots received a bird strike warning from the ground control center and issued a distress signal as well. But many experts say the landing gear issue was likely the main cause of the crash.",
      "The South Korean government has launched safety inspections on all the 101 Boeing 737-800s in the country. The Transport Ministry said authorities are looking at maintenance and operation records during five days of safety checks that are to run until Friday.",
      "The ministry said that a delegation of eight U.S. investigators \u2014 one from the Federal Aviation Administration, three from National Transportation Safety Board and four from Boeing \u2014 made an on-site visit to the crash site on Tuesday. The results of their examination weren\u2019t immediately available.",
      "Kim E-bae, Jeju Air\u2019s president, told reporters Tuesday that his company will add more maintenance workers and reduce flight operations by 10-15% until March as part of efforts to enhance the safety of aircraft operations.",
      "John Hansman, an aviation expert at MIT, said the crash was most likely the result of a problem with the plane\u2019s hydraulic control systems. He said that would be consistent with the landing gear and wing flaps not being deployed \u201cand might indicate a control issue which would explain the rush to get on the ground.\u201d",
      "The Boeing 737-800 -- an earlier version of 737 than the Max -- is a widely used plane with a good safety record, according to Najmedin Meshkati, an engineering professor at the University of Southern California who has studied aviation safety.",
      "He said the failure of the plane\u2019s system for broadcasting location, operating its landing gear and extending the wing flaps to slow down indicate a widespread problem that affected electrical and hydraulic systems. He is confident that investigators will learn what went wrong by analyzing information from the flight data and cockpit voice recorders.",
      "\u201cThese are really the two pillars for accident analysis and accident reconstruction,\u201d Meshkati said. Like other aviation experts, Meshkati also questioned the location of a solid wall just a few hundred feet (meters) past the end of the runway, given that planes occasionally do overshoot runways. \u201cHaving such a big concrete barrier over there was really very bad luck for this particular airplane,\u201d he said.",
      "South Korean officials have said they will look into whether the Muan airport\u2019s localizer \u2014 a concrete fence housing a set of antennas designed to guide aircraft safely during landings \u2014 should have been made with lighter materials that would break more easily upon impact.",
      "The crash was the deadliest disaster in South Korea\u2019s aviation history in decades. A seven-day national mourning has been declared until Jan. 4.",
      "The Transport Ministry said Tuesday that authorities have identified 175 bodies and are conducting DNA tests to identify the remaining five. Bereaved families said that officials told them that the bodies were so badly damaged that officials need time before returning them to relatives.",
      "On Tuesday, Park Han Shin, a representative of the families, accused the government of failing to provide freezers on time as promised and said there are worries that the bodies could decompose. \u201cThe last dignities of the victims are seriously hurt. We strongly criticize authorities for failing to keep its promise,\u201d Park said.",

      "Moldovans are bracing for a difficult winter ahead as a looming energy shortage could leave them without enough energy",
      "CHISINAU, Moldova -- On a frigid morning in Moldova\u2019s capital, 39-year-old postal worker Petru Murzin braces for a difficult winter as he fears a looming energy shortage could leave many Moldovans with \u201cno heating, no light.\u201d",
      "His concerns aren\u2019t unfounded.",
      "On Jan. 1, Russia\u2019s state-owned energy giant Gazprom is set to halt gas supplies to the European Union candidate country over an alleged $709 million debt for past supplies, a figure fiercely disputed by Moldova\u2019s pro-Western government, that has accused Moscow of weaponizing energy as a political tool to destabilize the country.",
      "\u201cI feel that we\u2019ve entered a crisis that is quite difficult to resolve \u2026 which worries me greatly,\u201d Murzin told The Associated Press in Chisinau. \u201cPrice increases are one thing, but when there is no gas at all, that\u2019s something entirely different.\u201d",
      "The cessation will stop gas flowing to the Kuciurgan power plant, the country\u2019s largest, which is situated in the separatist pro-Russian Transnistria region. The gas-operated plant generates electricity that powers a significant portion of Moldova proper.",
      "\u201cThere will be no heating, no light,\u201d Murzin added. \u201cWe are entering a very difficult year.\"",
      "Transnistria, which broke away after a short war in 1992 and is not recognized by most countries, also declared its own state of emergency earlier this month, fearing the region will not receive gas supplies. A large majority of Transnistria\u2019s 470,000 people speak Russian as their first language and some 200,000 are Russian citizens.",
      "On Dec. 13, Moldova\u2019s parliament voted in favor of imposing a state of emergency in the energy sector, as the looming crisis threatened to leave the former Soviet republic without sufficient energy this winter, sparking fears it could trigger a humanitarian crisis in Transnistria, where the impact of the gas cutoff could be immediately felt.",
      "Many observers have predicted that the looming energy shortage could force residents in Transnistria to travel to Moldova to seek basic amenities to get through winter, a season in which temperatures throughout the country regularly drop below subzero degrees Celsius.",
      "Cristian Cantir, a Moldovan associate professor of international relations at Oakland University, says that Moscow is likely trying to exploit a \u201cpotential humanitarian crisis in Transnistria to overwhelm Moldova\u2019s already-strained resources\u201d to amplify tensions between Chisinau and the region's de facto capital, Tiraspol.",
      "\u201cIt could stoke fears among the Moldovan electorate of a violent conflict, and give fodder to pro-Russian parties who will accuse Chisinau of being responsible for increased prices for gas and electricity, which will be a major campaign issue\u201d ahead of the country's parliamentary elections in 2025, he said.",
      "The unprecedented situation prompted Chisinau last week to implement a series of energy-saving measures beginning Jan. 1, which include reducing lighting in public and commercial buildings by at least 30%, and energy-intensive businesses operating during off-peak hours.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll probably have to save power till we have a solution,\u201d said Nicoleta Neagu, who is from Moldova but works in Germany. \u201cI hope we\u2019ll look at this seriously and not waste power on not-so-useful things.\u201d",
      "After Gazprom announced it would halt gas flows, Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean accused Moscow of using energy \"as a political weapon\u201d and said his government does not recognize the debt cited by the Russian energy giant, which he said has been \u201cinvalidated by an international audit.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis decision confirms once again the intention of the Kremlin to leave the inhabitants of the Transnistrian region without light and heat in the middle of the winter,\u201d he said.",
      "For 30-year-old Chisinau resident Iuliana, who did not want to give her surname, power outages would prevent her from doing her online job, which could also be untenable if the heating goes off in the middle of winter in the country of about 2.5 million people.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re afraid, but we\u2019re happy that there\u2019s no snow and the temperatures aren\u2019t that low and we can turn on the heating maybe only in the evening if we work at an office,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I work from home and I\u2019ll be directly affected.\u201d",
      "She also noted that Moldova has faced multiple crises in recent years, \u201cBut regarding power and gas, it\u2019s the first time we face this,\u201d she said.",
      "Moldovan President Maia Sandu criticized Russia on Monday for Gazprom\u2019s decision and said that the country has gas supplies \u201cfor the heating season\u201d and measures will be taken \u201cto ensure uninterrupted electricity supply,\u201d adding that plans are also in place to provide humanitarian aid to residents in Transnistria.",
      "\u201cThe Kremlin is again using energy blackmail in an attempt to destabilize the situation, to influence the 2025 parliamentary elections and to undermine our European journey,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is important to remain united, show solidarity, and trust in Moldova and its people. And to use energy rationally.\u201d",
      "Olga Rosca, an adviser to Sandu, told the AP that most of Moldova, excluding Transnistria, \u201cshouldn\u2019t see major disruptions\u201d and that \u201ccheaper electricity previously supplied from Transnistria will be replaced by more expensive imports from the EU.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the Transnistrian region, however, the situation will be much more serious,\u201d she said, \u201cand any crisis there will inevitably affect all of Moldova.\"",
      "Moldova has repeatedly claimed Russia is conducting a vast \u201chybrid war\u201d by meddling in elections, funding anti-government protests and running vast disinformation campaigns to try to topple the government and derail the country's EU aspirations.",
      "The Kuciurgan plant was privatized in 2004 by Transnistrian officials and later sold to a Russian state-owned company, but Chisinau doesn\u2019t recognize the privatization. On Monday, Recean asked the justice minister to review nationalization legislation to potentially recover \u201cstrategic assets that were forcefully taken over,\u201d referring to Moldovagaz, Moldova\u2019s main gas operator in which Gazprom owns a majority stake.",
      "Citing findings by British and Norwegian audit firms, Moldova claims its debt stands close to $8.6 million, a fraction of that claimed by the Russian energy giant. Gazprom said in a statement Saturday that it reserved the right to take further action, including terminating its contract with Moldovagaz.",
      "In late 2022, months after Russia fully invaded neighboring Ukraine, Moldova suffered major power outages following Russian strikes on Ukraine, which is interconnected to the Kuciurgan plant.",
      "When the war next door started, Moldova was entirely dependent on Moscow for natural gas but has since pushed to diversify and expand its energy sources, and now relies on obtaining gas from other European markets.",
      "Murzin, the postal worker, is expecting to see large inflows of people from Transnistria crossing the border once the shortage hits.",
      "\u201cI think cars will line up for several kilometers at the border,\u201d he said. \u201cMany people will come here, hoping for warmth.\"",

    "story": [
      "People in Zimbabwe are shunning traditional grocery stores to do their shopping at informal and illegal markets that pop up at night to avoid police raids rampant during the day",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- Batsirai Pabwe picked detergents, toothpaste, snacks and some pasta among several grocery items spread on the tarmac of a car parking space \u2014 an unorthodox night bazaar lit by cellphone flashlights and fluorescent lamps in Zimbabwe\u2019s capital, Harare.",
      "Traditional stores are struggling to survive as the volatility of Zimbabwe's new currency pushes prices up. Many like Pabwe now shun them for much cheaper informal markets that pop up at night to avoid the glare of authorities.",
      "From dusk, sidewalks, store or office verandahs and car parking spaces burst into unorthodox open air bazaars, offering anything from groceries to fresh meat, electronics, clothes, medicines, fashion accessories and stationery.",
      "Unfettered by expenses such as rising energy costs, taxes and laws that force formal retailers to accept the local currency at artificially low official exchange rates, informal traders, including children, offer better bargains. A box of juice that sells for $3 in a supermarket costs half of that on the street.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my first time shopping here. My friend told me that it\u2019s much cheaper than the supermarkets,\u201d 30-year-old Pabwe said, visibly relieved as he filled up a plastic bag with items for just $20. \u201cI decided to give it a try and I really enjoyed it.\u201d",
      "For the same amount in a supermarket a week ago, Pabwe said he only managed to get \u201cmeat and spices and they were not even that much.\u201d",
      "The once-prosperous southern African nation of 15 million people in April introduced a new gold-backed currency called ZiG, short for Zimbabwe Gold, to replace one that had been battered by depreciation and often outright rejection by the people.",
      "It is the country\u2019s sixth attempt at a new currency since the spectacular 2009 collapse of the Zimbabwe dollar and adoption of the U.S. dollar as legal tender amid hyperinflation of 5 billion percent, one of the world\u2019s worst currency crashes to date. The U.S. dollar has since remained legal tender alongside successive local currencies.",
      "The latest currency, the world\u2019s newest, came with pomp and fanfare \u2014 promotional catchy jingles and songs played repeatedly on public radio, television and online.",
      "Seven months on, the ZiG seems to be tanking, like its predecessors. The gap between official and black market exchange rates continues to widen, with many people and informal traders who dominate the economy again preferring the more stable dollar.",
      "Traditional stores, forced by authorities to charge using the local currency, are increasing prices to make ends meet. But they have also become uncompetitive against unregulated informal markets, the Retailers Association of Zimbabwe, an industry representative group, said in September.",
      "It warned of store closures, saying the situation is \u201cclearly untenable.\u201d",
      "In October, Pick n Pay, one of Africa\u2019s biggest grocery chains that operates more than 70 stores jointly with a local partner in Zimbabwe, said that it had \u2018impaired\u201d its investment in Zimbabwe \u201cto a book value of zero\u201d because of the \u201cdeteriorating economic conditions.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn every transaction business is doing in the formal setup, it\u2019s making an exchange rate loss that cannot be compensated. The major issue here is a currency crisis,\u201d said Gift Mugano, an economics professor. Huge overheads worsen the retailers\u2019 situation.",
      "\u201cEverything is against their survival. The informal sector works at night, (if there is) no electricity they use their phones, they don\u2019t care. They are there for survival,\u201d Mugano said.",
      "The contrast is palpable in Harare\u2019s Central Business District, where only a few shoppers solemnly scanned prices in a supermarket on a recent day.",
      "Soothing music played from speakers inside but was drowned out by the buzz created outside by hordes of street vendors shouting out bargains to a sea of shoppers.",
      "\u201cBusiness is booming,\u201d said Oswald Gari, a vendor, adding that he only works at night when the police leave.",
      "Gari, 51, said he's fending for his six children and four nephews under his care from the night trade. He harbors no hope of finding formal employment in a country where once roaring industrial sites are being turned into giant warehouses for imported goods, many which end up on the streets, and rail tracks are now overgrown with weeds.",
      "More than 80% of Zimbabwe\u2019s employable population ekes out a living in the informal sector, according to official figures and the International Labor Organization.",
      "For Pabwe, shopping from the informal night markets means less headaches.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite confusing, especially for people like me who really don\u2019t understand the value of the ZiG. I always get confused when I get into supermarkets,\u201d he said.",
      "He was satisfied with his shopping at night bazaar.",
      "\u201cI got everything I was looking for and the pricing is really affordable. I actually managed to buy a handful for just $20. I even got my washing powder and dishwashing liquid,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I will do this more often.\u201d"

      "Leonard missed the Clippers' first 34 games with what the team described as right knee injury recovery. It is his first NBA game action since April 26, when he played 25 minutes and scored nine points in Game 3 of the Clippers\u2019 Western Conference first-round playoff series against Dallas. The Clippers lost that game and were eventually eliminated in six games.",

      "Leonard appeared in 68 regular-season games in 2023-24, but missed 12 of the final 14 with right knee inflammation. He then came back for two games during the playoffs. He was picked for the Olympic team but was sent home during the training camp in Las Vegas when the USA Basketball staff felt Leonard's knee was not healthy enough to play.",

      "Hideki Matsuyama and Collin Morikawa put on quite the show at Kapalua",
      "KAPALUA, Hawaii -- Collin Morikawa had to judge how his ball would come out of the first cut of rough on the 16th hole at Kapalua, and it was close to perfect, settling 20 inches away for a sure birdie in his terrific duel with Hideki Matsuyama.",
      "Matsuyama was some 20 yards closer. He sent his lob wedge over the pin and used a combination of spin and slope for the shot to roll past Morikawa's ball and stop 8 inches away.",
      "It was like that all day Saturday at The Sentry.",
      "Matsuyama had a personal best with 11 birdies in his bogey-free round of 62, setting the Plantation course record for 54 holes at 27-under 192.",
      "All that got him was a one-shot lead over Morikawa, who matched his 62 and just about everything else Matsuyama did on another day of virtually no wind and ridiculously low scoring in the PGA Tour opener.",
      "\u201cCollin played well and I just kind of followed him, so good day,\u201d said Matsuyama, a Japanese star of few words and plenty of birdies.",
      "Morikawa played so well at the start that it wasn't until the sixth hole when he hit a shot he didn't like, a wedge to 25 feet and a birdie chance that rimmed around the cup. In 54 holes, he has only missed two greens.",
      "\u201cToday was really, really good. Couple shots out there a little squirrely, but for the most part the irons were center face, knew where they were going,\u201d Morikawa said.",
      "He briefly took the lead on the front nine by starting 5 under in five holes, including a 25-foot eagle putt on the fifth hole during a display of sublime shotmaking. Matsuyama caught him on the next hole and they were tight the rest of the way.",
      "The low scoring was reminiscent of 2022, when Cameron Smith set the tournament record \u2014 and PGA Tour record to par \u2014 at 34-under 258. The conditions were abnormally calm that year, and this year hasn't been much different.",
      "There was barely any wind on the western edge of Maui, and the Plantation course was built for fierce wind out of any direction. This became target practice for the world's best players, particularly on a course with the widest fairways on the PGA Tour.",
      "Three years ago, Smith and Jon Rahm were tied for the lead five shots clear of everyone else. Matsuyama was one ahead of Morikawa. Thomas Detry was next at 22-under 197, one ahead of Sungjae Im, who also had a 62.",
      "The average score was 67.49, another record since this tournament moved to Kapalua in 1999.",
      "Detry had a 65 and wound up losing ground.",
      "\u201cI shot 8 under today, but didn\u2019t really feel like I shot 8 under,\u201d he said. \u201cOther courses when you shoot 8 under you really fell like, \u2018Oh, yeah, I played unreal golf here.\u2019 I just felt like I played some really steady golf.\u201d",
      "Matsuyama and Morikawa kept piling up birdies and pulling away. What separated them was the reachable par-4 14th, where Matsuyama chipped to 3 feet for birdie and Morikawa drove into a bunker, blasted out to 10 feet and missed the birdie putt.",
      "Such a high level of golf brought importance to every shot, and they were up to the task. Morikawa talked about being in the zone, and with another player at his side in the same place, it created quite the stripe show.",
      "\u201cIt was a lot of fun,\u201d Matsuyama said, \u201cbut I would like for him to take it easy tomorrow.\u201d",
      "Morikawa has worked on his swing during the offseason, and the bigger work might have been on his attitude. He wants to pour everything into every shot, every day, every tournament and see where it leads.",
      "That makes Sunday a big test.",
      "\u201cYou look back at the greats, they did that,\u201d Morikawa said. \u201cYou look back at Tiger, he did that every single week. I think if I asked myself, \u2018Did I do that the past six years, every time?\u2019 Probably not, you know. But it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s hard to do that, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m going into this year is saying, \u2018You know, I\u2019ve got four days, let\u2019s see what I can do.\u2019\u201d",
      "Morikawa has had his chances at Kapalua. He had a six-shot lead two years ago until closing with a 72 and finishing behind Rahm, who had a 63.",
      "He played in the final group three times at big events last year \u2014 one behind Scottie Scheffler at the Masters, tied with Xander Schauffele at the PGA Championship and four shots behind Scheffler at the Memorial.",
      "Now he's trying to track down Matsuyama, who is going for his third win in the last 10 months. That goes back to his focus, and it reminded him of when he first turned pro in 2019.",
      "\u201cI had seven opportunities for sponsor exemptions, didn\u2019t know if I was going to get my card or not, and you\u2019re going to put everything out there because you have that goal,\u201d Morikawa said. \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to put everything out there tomorrow because I have the goal to win.\u201d",

      "Having overcome all that, Lamar Jackson is looking ahead to the most important challenges of all \u2014 in the postseason.",
      "\u201cI'm focused on the wild-card game, I'm not going to lie to you,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI'm cool with what's going on today. I'm cool, don't get me wrong, but my mind's on something else.\u201d",

      "Now the Ravens (12-5) will try to reach the Super Bowl for the first time with Jackson. They open the playoffs at home against either the Los Angeles Chargers or Pittsburgh Steelers. Baltimore was two games behind the Steelers in the division before closing with four consecutive victories.",
      "Cleveland (3-14) ended a dreadful season with six straight losses. Both Bailey Zappe and Dorian Thompson-Robinson took snaps at quarterback in the finale. Neither could move the ball much, and Zappe had an interception returned 26 yards for a touchdown by rookie Nate Wiggins for the game's first points.",
      "The biggest concern coming out of this game for the Ravens was the health of Pro Bowl receiver Zay Flowers, who left in the second quarter with a right knee injury.",
      "Jackson threw TD passes to Mark Andrews in the second quarter and Rashod Bateman in the third, finishing a spectacular statistical season that might be good enough to earn him a third MVP award. Jackson finished the season with 4,172 yards passing, 41 touchdown passes and four interceptions. He became the first quarterback to reach 4,000 yards passing with 40 TD passes and four or fewer interceptions.",
      "Jackson also finished the season with 915 yards rushing, becoming the first player to throw for 4,000 yards and rush for at least 800. His passer rating of 119.6 wasn't quite high enough to break the single-season record of 122.5 held by Aaron Rodgers.",
      "Zappe threw for 170 yards with two interceptions. His 16-yard scoring pass to Jordan Akins made it 21-10 in the fourth, but the Ravens answered with 70-yard drive that ended with a 2-yard touchdown run by Derrick Henry.",
      "Henry, who turned 31 on Saturday, added a 43-yard scoring run late in the fourth. He finished the season with 1,921 yards rushing and a franchise-record 16 touchdowns on the ground.",
      "Cleveland has now gone 28 consecutive games without allowing a 300-yard passer. Jackson finished 16 of 32 for 217 yards.",
      "\u201cI respect this game, these players do. It\u2019s a privilege to play, it\u2019s a privilege to coach,\u201d said Browns coach Kevin Stefanski, whose team was a 20-point underdog shortly before kickoff according to BetMGM. \u201cIf they\u2019re keeping score, we\u2019re going to compete to the end.\u201d",
      "Cleveland's Myles Garrett entered the game tied for the NFL lead with 14 sacks, but although the Browns pressured Jackson at times, nobody could sack him. Garrett did have a tackle for loss.",
      "Cincinnati's Trey Hendrickson, who also came into the day with 14, moved ahead of Garrett with an early sack in the Bengals' game against Pittsburgh on Saturday night.",
      "\u201cLamar is a very difficult quarterback to sack, but Myles played the run and battled,\u201d Stefanski said.",
      "Ravens defensive lineman Michael Pierce, listed at a rotund 355 pounds, picked off a pass late in the fourth \u2014 his first interception in nine NFL seasons. He had some room to run but gave himself up with a fairly nimble slide before being mobbed by teammates.",
      "\u201cThe most amazing play in NFL history right there,\u201d coach John Harbaugh said.",
      "Although the Ravens finished against the last-place Browns, Harbaugh said they should be well prepared for the postseason. In fact, unless Miami snags the final wild card, Baltimore will have already faced every other team in the AFC playoff field.",
      "\u201cSame level of competition that we\u2019ve been playing against,\" Harbaugh said. \"We\u2019ve played all the teams in the playoffs.\u201d",
      "Cleveland DT Mike Hall Jr. was carted off with a knee injury in the third quarter. ... Browns CB Mike Ford Jr. injured his forearm. ... Cleveland CB Martin Emerson Jr. injured an ankle.",

      "Within hours of the New Year\u2019s Day explosion that burned the driver beyond recognition and injured seven, Tesla was able to track Matthew Livelsberger\u2019s movements in detail from Denver to Las Vegas, and also confirm that the problem was explosives in the truck, not the truck itself. Tesla used data collected from charging stations and from onboard software -- and to great acclaim.",
      "\u201cI have to thank Elon Musk, specifically,\u201d said Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Kevin McMahill to reporters. \u201cHe gave us quite a bit of additional information.\u201c",

      "Apple has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit that accused the company of turning its virtual assistant Siri into a snoop that eavesdropped on the users of iPhones and other trendy devices in a betrayal to its long-standing commitment to personal privacy.",
      "The proposed settlement filed in federal court earlier this week still needs to be approved by a judge, but here are a few things to know about the case and the privacy issues that it raised.",
      "WHAT WAS THE LAWSUIT ABOUT?",
      "The Wood Law Firm, which specializes in class-action lawsuits, filed the complaint against Apple in August 2019, shortly after The Guardian newspaper published an article alleging that Siri's microphone had been surreptitiously turned on to record conversations occurring without the users' knowledge.",
      "Apple issued a September 2014 software update that was supposed to activate the virtual assistant only with the triggering words \u201cHey, Siri,\u201d but The Guardian story alleged Siri was listening and recording conversations at other times to help improve the company\u2019s technology.",
      "The story led to the lawsuit, which later raised allegations that Apple shared some of the conversations that Siri secretly recorded with advertisers looking to connect with consumers who were more likely to buy their products and services.",
      "HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE COVERED BY THE SETTLEMENT?",
      "Tens of millions of U.S consumers who owned or purchased iPhones and other devices equipped with Siri from September 17, 2014, through the end of last year will be eligible to file claims.",
      "HOW MUCH MONEY WILL EACH ELIGIBLE CONSUMER RECEIVE?",
      "It's far too early to tell for certain, but the settlement currently envisions paying out up to $20 per Siri-enabled device, with each consumer limited to a maximum. The final amount could be affected by two factors: the number of claims and how much of the settlement fund is reduced to cover legal fees and costs.",
      "A claims administrator estimates only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers will file claims. The lawyers in the case currently are seeking nearly $30 million in fees and expenses, but that figure could still be lowered by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White, who is overseeing the case in Oakland, California. A proposed Feb. 14 court hearing has been proposed to review the settlement terms.",
      "DID APPLE BREAK ANY LAWS?",
      "If the allegations were true, Apple may have violated federal wiretapping laws and other statutes designed to protect people's privacy. But Apple adamantly denied any wrongdoing and maintained that it would have been cleared of any misconduct had the case gone to trial. Lawyers representing the consumers asserted that Apple's misbehavior was so egregious that the company could have been liable for $1.5 billion in damages if it lost the case.",
      "Although Apple hasn't explained the reasons for making the settlement, major companies often decide it makes more sense to resolve class-action cases rather than to continue to run up legal costs and risk the chance of potentially bad publicity. The lawsuit also targeted one of Apple's core values framing privacy as a \u201cfundamental human right.\u201d",
      "Although $95 million sounds like a lot of money, it's a pittance for Apple. Since September 2014, the company's total profits have exceeded $700 billion \u2014 a streak of prosperity that has helped propel the company's market value to about $3.7 trillion.",
      "DO I NEED TO BE WORRIED ABOUT THE MICROPHONES ON OTHER DEVICES SPYING ON ME?",
      "Perhaps. A case similar to the one filed against Siri is still active in a San Jose, California, federal court against Google and the virtual assistant in its Android software, which has been widely used in smartphones for years.",
      "JUST IN CASE, HOW DO I DISABLE SIRI?",
      "You can turn Apple\u2019s virtual assistant off by following these simple steps:",
      "1. Navigate to Settings Siri & Search.",
      "2. Toggle off Listen for \u2018Hey Siri\u2019 and press the Side button for Siri.",
      "3. Tap Turn Off Siri when a pop-up window appears.",
      "You can also disable individual apps' access to your iPhone's mic by doing the following: Navigate to Settings (select the app) then toggle off Microphone."

      "Apple has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit accusing the privacy-minded company of deploying its virtual assistant Siri to eavesdrop on people using its iPhone and other trendy devices.",
      "The proposed settlement filed Tuesday in an Oakland, California, federal court would resolve a 5-year-old lawsuit revolving around allegations that Apple surreptitiously activated Siri to record conversations through iPhones and other devices equipped with the virtual assistant for more than a decade.",
      "The alleged recordings occurred even when people didn't seek to activate the virtual assistant with the trigger words, \u201cHey, Siri.\" Some of the recorded conversations were then shared with advertisers in an attempt to sell their products to consumers more likely to be interested in the goods and services, the lawsuit asserted.",
      "The allegations about a snoopy Siri contradicted Apple's long-running commitment to protect the privacy of its customers \u2014 a crusade that CEO Tim Cook has often framed as a fight to preserve \u201ca fundamental human right.\u201d",
      "Apple isn't acknowledging any wrongdoing in the settlement, which still must be approved by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White. Lawyers in the case have proposed scheduling a Feb. 14 court hearing in Oakland to review the terms.",
      "If the settlement is approved, tens of millions of consumers who owned iPhones and other Apple devices from Sept. 17, 2014, through the end of last year could file claims. Each consumer could receive up to $20 per Siri-equipped device covered by the settlement, although the payment could be reduced or increased, depending on the volume of claims. Only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers are expected to file claims, according to estimates in court documents.",
      "Eligible consumers will be limited to seeking compensation on a maximum of five devices.",
      "The settlement represents a sliver of the $705 billion in profits that Apple has pocketed since September 2014. It's also a fraction of the roughly $1.5 billion that the lawyers representing consumers had estimated Apple could been required to pay if the company had been found of violating wiretapping and other privacy laws had the case gone to a trial.",
      "The attorneys who filed the lawsuit may seek up to $29.6 million from the settlement fund to cover their fees and other expenses, according to court documents.",

      "NEW YORK -- Two deadly incidents on New Year's Day \u2014 an attack being investigated as an act of terrorism in New Orleans and an explosion of a Tesla Cybertruck in Las Vegas \u2014 both involved vehicles that were rented on Turo, a peer-to-peer car sharing company.",
      "Early Wednesday, 42-year-old Army veteran Shamsud-Din Bahar Jabbar rammed a pickup truck into a crowd in New Orleans\u2019 famed French Quarter \u2014 killing 14 people who were celebrating the New Year. And police fatally shot Jabbar in a following firefight. Just hours after, outside of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s hotel in Las Vegas, a Tesla Cybertruck packed with explosives also burst into flames. The person inside, identified as active-duty U.S. Army Green Beret Matthew Livelsberger, died. Officials later said he suffered a gunshot wound to the head before the explosion.",
      "Turo said it is \u201cshocked and saddened\" Wednesday's events and that \u201cour hearts are with the victims and their families.\"",
      "The company added that is \"outraged by the misuse of our marketplace by the two individuals who perpetrated these acts.\u201d",
      "While both incidents involved vehicles rented through Turo, the FBI has said that is has found \u201cno definitive link\u201d between the New Orleans attack and the Las Vegas explosion.",
      "Still, the incidents have put a spotlight on the car-sharing platform. Here's what we know about Turo.",
      "Turo is a peer-to-peer car-sharing company. The online platform allows car owners to rent their own vehicles directly to other nearby drivers, or \u201cguests.\u201d \u201cHosts\u201d set their prices, availability and delivery options for renters to choose from and book via Turo's website or app.",
      "Billing itself as \u201cthe world\u2019s largest car sharing marketplace\" today, Turo says it operates through a network of hosts across the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia and France.",
      "The origins of the San Francisco-based company date back almost 15 years, with its first trip completed in May 2010 and nationwide launch later arriving in 2012. The platform was originally introduced as \u201cRelayRides,\u201d but rebranded to Turo in 2015.",
      "Over the last 12 years of operating history, Turo says it collected data from over 90 million booked days, 27 million trips, 8.6 billion miles (13.8 billion kilometers) driven as of Sept. 30, 2024. Less than 0.1% of those Turo trips ended with a serious incident such as a vehicle theft, the company said Thursday.",
      "Again, investigators have not found any definitive connections between Wednesday's attack in New Orleans attack and following explosion in Las Vegas. But both incidents involved vehicles rented on Turo.",
      "Authorities have said that the Cybertruck involved in the Las Vegas explosion was rented through the Turo app in Colorado. Kevin McMahill, the elected sheriff of Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, said Wednesday that authorities knew who rented this truck, but were not releasing the name until investigators determine if it is the same person who died.",
      "On Wednesday, Turo confirmed that both the Cybertruck and the pickup truck used in the New Orleans attack were rented using the platform.",
      "Turo has said it's sharing any information it has with law enforcement as investigations continue. The company has also noted that the individuals involved did not have criminal backgrounds that would have identified them as security threats. It said every Turo renter is screened through a \"multi-layer, data-science-based trust and safety process.\u201d",
      "The men involved in the incidents had valid driver\u2019s licenses, clean background checks, and were honorably discharged from the U.S. military, Turo noted Thursday.",
      "\u201cThey could have boarded any plane, checked into a hotel, or rented a car or truck from a traditional vehicle rental chain,\u201d the company said. \"We do not believe these two individuals would have been flagged by anyone \u2014 including Big Rental or law enforcement.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Five years after the virus that causes COVID emerged in China it still holds some mysteries",
      "Five years ago, a cluster of people in Wuhan, China, fell sick with a virus never before seen in the world.",
      "The germ didn't have a name, nor did the illness it would cause. It wound up setting off a pandemic that exposed deep inequities in the global health system and reshaped public opinion about how to control deadly emerging viruses.",
      "The virus is still with us, though humanity has built up immunity through vaccinations and infections. It's less deadly than it was in the pandemic's early days and it no longer tops the list of leading causes of death. But the virus is evolving, meaning scientists must track it closely.",
      "We don\u2019t know. Scientists think the most likely scenario is that it circulated in bats, like many coronaviruses. They think it then infected another species, probably racoon dogs, civet cats or bamboo rats, which in turn infected humans handling or butchering those animals at a market in Wuhan, where the first human cases appeared in late November 2019.",
      "That's a known pathway for disease transmission and likely triggered the first epidemic of a similar virus, known as SARS. But this theory has not been proven for the virus that causes COVID-19. Wuhan is home to several research labs involved in collecting and studying coronaviruses, fueling debate over whether the virus instead may have leaked from one.",
      "It's a difficult scientific puzzle to crack in the best of circumstances. The effort has been made even more challenging by political sniping around the virus' origins and by what international researchers say are moves by China to withhold evidence that could help.",
      "The true origin of the pandemic may not be known for many years \u2014 if ever.",
      "Probably more than 20 million. The World Health Organization has said member countries reported more than 7 million deaths from COVID-19 but the true death toll is estimated to be at least three times higher.",
      "In the U.S., an average of about 900 people a week have died of COVID-19 over the past year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The coronavirus continues to affect older adults the most. Last winter in the U.S., people age 75 and older accounted for about half the nation\u2019s COVID-19 hospitalizations and in-hospital deaths, according to the CDC.",
      "\u201cWe cannot talk about COVID in the past, since it\u2019s still with us,\u201d WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.",
      "Scientists and vaccine-makers broke speed records developing COVID-19 vaccines that have saved tens of millions of lives worldwide \u2013 and were the critical step to getting life back to normal.",
      "Less than a year after China identified the virus, health authorities in the U.S. and Britain cleared vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna. Years of earlier research \u2014 including Nobel-winning discoveries that were key to making the new technology work \u2014 gave a head start for so-called mRNA vaccines.",
      "Today, there\u2019s also a more traditional vaccine made by Novavax, and some countries have tried additional options. Rollout to poorer countries was slow but the WHO estimates more than 13 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered globally since 2021.",
      "The vaccines aren't perfect. They do a good job of preventing severe disease, hospitalization and death, and have proven very safe, with only rare serious side effects. But protection against milder infection begins to wane after a few months.",
      "Like flu vaccines, COVID-19 shots must be updated regularly to match the ever-evolving virus \u2014 contributing to public frustration at the need for repeated vaccinations. Efforts to develop next-generation vaccines are underway, such as nasal vaccines that researchers hope might do a better job of blocking infection.",
      "Genetic changes called mutations happen as viruses make copies of themselves. And this virus has proven to be no different.",
      "Scientists named these variants after Greek letters: alpha, beta, gamma, delta and omicron. Delta, which became dominant in the U.S. in June 2021, raised a lot of concerns because it was twice as likely to lead to hospitalization as the first version of the virus.",
      "Then in late November 2021, a new variant came on the scene: omicron.",
      "\u201cIt spread very rapidly,\" dominating within weeks, said Dr. Wesley Long, a pathologist at Houston Methodist in Texas. \u201cIt drove a huge spike in cases compared to anything we had seen previously.\u201d",
      "But on average, the WHO said, it caused less severe disease than delta. Scientists believe that may be partly because immunity had been building due to vaccination and infections.",
      "\u201cEver since then, we just sort of keep seeing these different subvariants of omicron accumulating more different mutations,\u201d Long said. \u201cRight now, everything seems to locked on this omicron branch of the tree.\u201d",
      "The omicron relative now dominant in the U.S. is called XEC, which accounted for 45% of variants circulating nationally in the two-week period ending Dec. 21, the CDC said. Existing COVID-19 medications and the latest vaccine booster should be effective against it, Long said, since \u201cit\u2019s really sort of a remixing of variants already circulating.\u201d",
      "Millions of people remain in limbo with a sometimes disabling, often invisible, legacy of the pandemic called long COVID.",
      "It can take several weeks to bounce back after a bout of COVID-19, but some people develop more persistent problems. The symptoms that last at least three months, sometimes for years, include fatigue, cognitive trouble known as \u201cbrain fog,\u201d pain and cardiovascular problems, among others.",
      "Doctors don\u2019t know why only some people get long COVID. It can happen even after a mild case and at any age, although rates have declined since the pandemic's early years. Studies show vaccination can lower the risk.",
      "It also isn't clear what causes long COVID, which complicates the search for treatments. One important clue: Increasingly researchers are discovering that remnants of the coronavirus can persist in some patients\u2019 bodies long after their initial infection, although that can\u2019t explain all cases.",

      "The Austin, Texas, company sold 495,570 vehicles from October through December, boosting deliveries to 1.79 million for the full year. That was 1.1% below 2023 sales of 1.81 million as overall demand for electric vehicles in the U.S. and elsewhere slowed.",
      "The year-over-year global sales drop is Tesla\u2019s first since 2011, according to figures from analytics firm Global Data. The company sold 1,306 vehicles in 2010, but that dropped slightly to 1,129 the following year.",

      "In 2022, Tesla predicted that its sales would grow 50% most years, but the prediction ran into an aging model lineup and increased competition in China, Europe and the U.S. In the U.S., analysts say most early adopters of technology already own electric vehicles, and more mainstream buyers have concerns about range, price and the ability to find charging stations on longer trips.",
      "The fourth-quarter deliveries fell thousands short of Wall Street expectations. Analysts polled by data provider FactSet expected sales of 498,000 vehicles.",
      "Falling sales early in the year led to once-unheard of discounts for the automaker, cutting into its industry leading profit margins.",
      "Competition from legacy and startup automakers is also growing as they try to nibble away at the company\u2019s market share.",
      "Daniel Ives, a financial analyst at Wedbush, said he thinks the stock should be valued more on its promise of creating fully self-driving, autonomous vehicles and its AI technology and is still worth buying despite the sales drop.",
      "\u201cWe have never viewed Tesla simply as a car company...instead we have always viewed Musk and Tesla as a leading disruptive technology global player,\u201d wrote Ives. \u201cAnd the first part of this grand strategic vision has taken shape.\u201d",
      "The fourth-quarter sales, while a record for Tesla, show that the company\u2019s aging model lineup is reaching saturation in the entry level luxury vehicle market, said Morningstar Analyst Seth Goldstein.",
      "Aside from the Cybertruck, which has had limited appeal, Tesla\u2019s newest consumer model is the Y small SUV which first went on sale in 2020.",
      "To meet Tesla management\u2019s guidance of 20% to 30% annual sales growth this year, the company will need to come out with a vehicle priced in the mid $30,000s to appeal to more mainstream buyers who might be considering gas, electric or hybrid vehicles, Goldstein said.",
      "Tesla has floated the possibility of a new version of the Model Y that would cost in the mid $30,000s that may be smaller inside than the current Y with fewer features, Goldstein said.",
      "\u201cAt that point you\u2019re comparable to some Hondas and Fords and GMs,\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cIt takes you out of the luxury market to the more affordable vehicle market.\u201d",
      "Jeff Schuster, vice president of automotive research Global Data, said Tesla faces intense competition worldwide from EV makers in China, the U.S. and elsewhere, many of which are selling EVs to more mainstream buyers. \u201cIf they want to continue to see the growth they had, they need to expand to other sizes and price points,\u201d he said.",
      "Also, Musk\u2019s support of Trump for U.S. president also could be turning off some buyers who may be more environmentally conscious and lean toward Democrats, Schuster said. A broader, less costly lineup would appeal to a larger group of buyers, he said. \u201cI suppose the choices that he\u2019s made on the political front don\u2019t line up with a good portion of his buyers\u2019 profile,\u201d Schuster said.",
      "Industry experts say that Tesla used to be the only automaker with credible electric vehicles, but now others such as China\u2019s BYD now have more to offer.",
      "At present, automakers have 75 electric vehicle models for sale in the U.S. Through the first nine months of last year, electric vehicle sales slowed in the U.S., but they are still growing.",
      "Through September, new EV sales rose 7.2% to about 936,000 in the U.S., according to Motorintelligence.com. That\u2019s slower growth than the 47% increase in 2023. But EV sales this year still are likely to surpass last year\u2019s record of 1.19 million. Most other automakers will report full-year sales on Friday.",
      "Nearly all of Tesla\u2019s sales last quarter came from the smaller and less-expensive Models 3 and Y, with the company selling only 23,640 of its more expensive models that include X and S, as well as the new Cybertruck.",
      "Tesla's global electric vehicle sales edged out Chinese rival BYD, which announced Thursday that total soared 41% last year including 1.77 million EVs. The company is vying with Tesla for the world\u2019s top selling EV maker.",
      "Fourth quarter production of 459,445 vehicles was below total deliveries for the quarter, and full year production of 1.77 million was less than the year\u2019s sales.",

      "Authorities investigating the suspect in the truck attack that killed 14 and injured dozens in New Orleans on New Year's Day are probing when, where and how his alleged \"radicalization\" occurred, a local official said on Friday.",
      "Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a 42-year-old Army veteran and U.S.-born citizen from Texas, posted several videos online hours before the Bourbon Street attack \"proclaiming his support for ISIS\" and mentioning he joined ISIS before this summer, according to the FBI.",
      "ABC News has learned new details about the recordings Jabbar allegedly made, which were posted to Facebook shortly after 1 a.m. on New Year's Day, apparently as Jabbar was driving to New Orleans. The videos show Jabbar recording himself, largely obscured by darkness, according to an official who has seen the first of five videos posted before the attack. GPS instructions can be heard in the background.",
      "In the video, Jabbar speaks in a measured tone, claiming he joined ISIS earlier that year, according to the official. He references New Orleans and hinting that he contemplated harming members of his own family before deciding to carry out the attack, the official said.",
      "Sources told ABC News the FBI is also reviewing a series of audio recordings allegedly made where Jabbar espouses religious views and beliefs.",
      "So far, there is no evidence that any these videos or recordings were flagged to law enforcement before the attack unfolded.",
      "Since Thursday, investigators have been focused on piecing together his path to radicalization and the events that led up to his decision to attack Bourbon Street.",
      "Two U.S. officials told ABC on Friday that, though it's still very early in the investigation, there is no evidence, so far, that Jabbar had actually been in contact with a direct ISIS representative.",
      "The officials also noted that there has been no claim of responsibility by ISIS.",
      "However, investigators are still working through his three phones and two laptops and examining his travel history.",
      "Jabbar's foreign travel is also part of the ongoing investigation, law enforcement officials told ABC News.",
      "On Friday, Jabbar's half-brother told ABC News the suspect traveled to Egypt in 2023 for around a month, telling his family he was going \"because it was cheap and beautiful.\"",
      "Investigators are working to determine what he did during his travel in Egypt, why he went and who he interacted with while there, multiple sources said. Critical to the probe is whether he had been radicalized prior to the travel or if the travel marked the start of his radicalization.",
      "\"This next most important phase of the investigation is to find out how that radicalization happened and if it happened on that trip,\" Orleans Parish District Attorney Jason Williams told ABC News.",
      "Jabbar was shot dead in the midst of Wednesday's attack in New Orleans, after driving a pickup truck onto a sidewalk and around a parked police car serving as a barricade to plow into pedestrians over a three-block stretch on Bourbon Street, police said.",
      "Jabbar then exited the damaged vehicle armed with an assault rifle and opened fire on police officers, law enforcement said. Officers returned fire, killing him.",
      "Officials said the first 24 hours after the ramming attack were occupied by a feverish effort to determine whether there were additional suspects on the loose or if Jabbar worked with accomplices.",
      "In another update Friday, authorities revealed Jabbar set a small fire in the hallway of the property in New Orleans he rented on Mandeville Street before the attack using \"strategically placed accelerants throughout the house in his effort to destroy it and other evidence of his crime,\" according to the joint update from FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.",
      "However, after Jabbar left the residence, the fire burned itself out before spreading to other rooms. When the New Orleans Fire Department arrived, the fire was smoldering, and investigators were able to recover evidence, including pre-cursors for bomb making material and a privately made device suspected of being a silencer for a rifle.\"",
      "Regarding the explosive devices, the FBI said it believes that during the Bourbon Street attack, Jabbar intended to use a transmitter that was later found in the truck to detonate the devices.",
      "The transmitter, along with two firearms connected to Jabbar, was being transported to the FBI Laboratory for additional testing, authorities said.",
      "Before the deadly ramming, surveillance footage showed Jabbar placing two improvised explosive devices in coolers in the Bourbon Street area, investigators said. He had a remote detonator in the truck to set off the two devices, but both were rendered safe, officials said.",
      "Inside one of the coolers, investigators found a device consisting of a steel pipe, nails and a relatively rare explosive chemical, a senior law enforcement official told ABC News on Friday. The remote detonation capability apparently failed to work, the official said.",
      "NBC News was the first to report on the rare chemical.",
      "A search of Jabbar's home in Houston also turned up bomb-making materials, sources confirmed to ABC News on Thursday. The items found were also referred to as \"precursor chemicals\" by agents in the field, sources said.",
      "The FBI and Department of Homeland Security issued a joint intelligence bulletin warning the nation's 18,000 law-enforcement agencies about potential copycats, ABC News learned.",
      "The bulletin was sent out of an abundance of caution to sensitize law enforcement around the country to be on the lookout for any activity pointing to the use of vehicles as a method to inflict mass casualties, sources told ABC News.",
      "\"We advise federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial government and law enforcement officials and private sector security partners to remain vigilant of potential copycat or retaliatory attacks inspired by this attack and other recent, lethal vehicle-ramming incidents across the globe,\" the bulletin said.",
      "The bulletin notes that ISIS has been promoting the use of vehicles as a terrorism weapon since around 2014.",
      "ISIS has ramped up calls for its supporters to launch low-tech, mass casualty ramming attacks in recent months, sources told ABC News, especially since the most recent Israel-Hamas conflict began in October 2023.",
      "The bulletin stated that Jabbar was inspired by ISIS but that there remains no evidence of any co-conspirators. A senior law-enforcement official told ABC News that there is so far no sign of ISIS claiming responsibility for the New Orleans attack.",
      "\"Law enforcement should be aware that in many cases attackers have conducted vehicle-ramming attacks with secondary weapons and may continue the attack with edged weapons, firearms, or IEDs after the vehicle has stopped,\" the bulletin said. The tactic could be \"attractive\" for foreign terrorist organizations and other actors due to its low complexity threshold, the warning said.",
      "An intelligence bulletin from the New York Police Department obtained by ABC News indicated that ISIS supporters did celebrate the attack online. Violent extremists, the bulletin said, \"continue to view densely populated walkways, parades, mass gatherings and other outdoor events along streets, especially during holidays, as vulnerable targets of opportunity.\"",
      "\"This enduring threat underscores the criticality of pre-staged blocker cars and the deployment of other effectively configured countermeasures including heavy block, barriers and bollards,\" it added.",
      "Law enforcement cleared and reopened Bourbon Street on Thursday as the investigation continued. New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said authorities had the \"confidence\" to reopen the area to the public ahead of the Sugar Bowl on Thursday afternoon, which was initially scheduled for Wednesday but postponed in the wake of the attack.",
      "\"I want to reassure the public that the city of New Orleans is not only ready for game day today, but we're ready to continue to host large-scale events in our city,\" she said. \"Our hearts and prayers continue to go out to the victims' families,\" Cantrell added.",
      "President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden will head to New Orleans on Monday to meet with the families and community members, the White House said. Biden said Friday that he has spoken with victims' families.",
      "There is no apparent direct connection between the New Orleans attack and Wednesday's Tesla Cybertruck explosion outside the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas, which is also being investigated as a possible act of terror, the FBI said Thursday.",

      "Newly reelected Speaker Mike Johnson told House Republicans during a closed-door policy retreat on Saturday that President-elect Donald Trump wants Congress to pass one sweeping bill full of his priorities through the budget reconciliation process, multiple sources told ABC News.",
      "Johnson said Trump wants to pass \u201cone big, beautiful bill,\u201d according to sources.",
      "House Republicans are meeting privately at Fort McNair to map their legislative strategy under Trump\u2019s presidency for taxes, the border and energy, among other policy areas.",
      "Trump\u2019s desire to have one bill instead of two is a break from what Senate Majority Leader John Thune has laid out as his plan, which includes two separate packages, multiple outlets have reported.",
      "With a trifecta in the House, the Senate and the White House, Republicans will have the ability to attempt to implement major policy changes without any Democratic support using a procedural tool called budget reconciliation, which only requires a simple majority of votes to pass the chamber. But the razor-thin GOP majority in the House means a reconciliation package will also be a major challenge to pass.",
      "The House Freedom Caucus has endorsed a two-step plan rather than Trump's single bill, and the group of hard-liners may stand in the way of Trump\u2019s desires. On Friday, several members of the House Freedom Caucus nearly stopped Johnson from getting selected as speaker on the first round, though most of them ultimately voted for Johnson to allow him to obtain the 218 votes needed to be elected. Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie was the only House Republican who didn't vote for Johnson.",
      "Legislation passed via budget reconciliation, which would allow the Senate to avert the 60-vote threshold from the filibuster, would need consensus among House Republicans with their majority of 219 Republicans to 215 Democrats. If they wish to pass legislation without any Democratic support, they can only have one GOP defection if all members of the House are present. The single bill Trump favors through reconciliation would put the GOP caucus to the test.",
      "\u201cThere are a group of us who support breaking it up into two pieces,\" House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Harris said on Saturday during a Fox News interview. \"The first piece, a very small border piece where we give the president the money that he needs to secure our southern border and start deporting illegal, criminal aliens.\"",

      "The fourth anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol has a new focus as lawmakers brace for the prospect that Donald Trump may soon pardon many of the more than 1,500 people charged with crimes for their actions related to the riot",
      "WASHINGTON -- The fourth anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol has a new focus as lawmakers brace for the prospect that President-elect Donald Trump may soon pardon many of the more than 1,500 people charged with crimes for their actions related to the riot.",
      "Trump said he would issue pardons to rioters on \u201cDay 1\u201d of his presidency, which begins Jan. 20. \u201cMost likely, I\u2019ll do it very quickly,\u201d he said recently on NBC's \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d He added that \u201cthose people have suffered long and hard. And there may be some exceptions to it. I have to look. But, you know, if somebody was radical, crazy.\u201d",
      "His promise, made throughout his campaign for the White House, is shadowing events Monday as lawmakers gather to certify a presidential election for the first time since 2021, when Trump\u2019s supporters breached the Capitol and temporarily halted the certification of an election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden.",
      "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said she has spoken at length with Trump and is lobbying him to pardon everyone who participated in the siege. Few Republicans are going that far, but many believe it\u2019s appropriate for Trump to look at pardons on a case-by-case basis.",
      "\u201cHere we are nearly four years later. Many of these people have been in prison since 2021. Even the ones that fought Capitol Police, caused damage to the Capitol, I think they\u2019ve served their time and I think they should all be pardoned and released from prison,\" Greene said. \"Some of these people have been given prison sentences: 10 years, 18 years and more. I think it\u2019s an injustice. It\u2019s a two-tiered justice system, and it\u2019s time to end it.\u201d",
      "More than 1,250 have pleaded guilty or been convicted after trials in connection with Jan. 6, with more than 650 receiving prison time ranging from a few days to 22 years.",
      "Many of those who broke into the Capitol were echoing Trump\u2019s false claims about election fraud. Some rioters menacingly called out the names of prominent politicians \u2014 particularly then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and then-Vice President Mike Pence, who refused to try to object to Biden\u2019s win. Lawmakers who had evacuated both chambers on Jan. 6 returned that night to finish their work.",
      "Police officers who defended the Capitol are particularly incensed about the possible pardons. Many officers were beaten, some with their own weapons, as they tried to hold back the mob. About 140 officers were injured on Jan. 6, making it \u201clikely the largest single day mass assault of law enforcement\u201d in American history, Matthew Graves, the outgoing U.S. attorney in the nation's capital, has said.",
      "\u201cYou cannot be pro-police officer and rule of law if you are pardoning people who betrayed that trust, injured police officers and ransacked the Capitol,\u201d said Capitol Police Sgt. Aquilino Gonell, who retired due to his injuries after fighting rioters.",
      "Some Republicans in Congress, even those closely aligned with Trump, suggested not all Jan. 6 offenders should be treated the same.",
      "Rep. Jim Jordan, a top Trump ally who leads the House Judiciary Committee, said he supported some pardons, but also made a distinction.",
      "\u201cFor people who didn\u2019t commit any violence, I think everyone supports that. I think that makes sense,\u201d said Jordan, R-Ohio.",
      "Veteran Republican Rep. Gus Bilirakis, R-Fla., also wasn't ready to go as far as Greene. \"You've got to look at it individually. Some probably deserve to be pardoned,\u201d he said.",
      "But he was more reticent when asked if those who attacked U.S. Capitol police officers should be among those pardoned.",
      "\u201cMy goodness. Again, I'd have to look at the scenario,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if they attacked the U.S. Capitol Police, it's a big problem.\u201d",
      "Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., said not every single charge is the same and that people who were trespassing are a different category from those who entered the Capitol and damaged property. He said he believes Trump will look at each individual circumstance and decide what is appropriate.",
      "\u201cPeople who attacked police officers, listen, I don't think that is something we should ever condone,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "House Democrats, who led the drive to impeach Trump over Jan. 6 and conducted a wide-ranging investigation into the attack, warned that the pardons could have far-reaching consequences, both for the rule of law and the security of the country. Members of the extremist Oath Keepers and Proud Boys, for instance, were convicted of seditious conspiracy and other crimes in relation to the insurrection.",
      "\u201cThose 140-odd law enforcement people who got hurt defending this institution, I think anyone who loves peace and security would be offended that you would pardon people who attacked those individuals for doing their jobs,\u201d said Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss.",
      "Thompson led the House committee that investigated the events surrounding Jan. 6, concluding with a report that said Trump \u201clit the fire\" for the insurrection.",
      "Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., who served as lead impeachment manager during Trump's second impeachment trial in which he was acquitted, said if pardons are going to happen, people should demand contrition and repentance from each of those pardoned and an affirmative statement they pose no further threat to public safety.",
      "\u201cBecause anything that happens by these people, in a political context or some other context, will essentially be laid at the doorstep soon-to-be President Donald Trump,\u201d Raskin said.",
      "Like police officers who protected them, lawmakers who were in the Capitol during the attack have a visceral reaction to the pardon talk, having barely escaped a mob that seemed determined to do them harm.",
      "Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., who was trapped in the House gallery as rioters tried to break in below, said it would be \u201cextraordinarily difficult\u201d for him and many others if Trump goes ahead with the pardons.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m pretty controlled and pretty disciplined, but that would be really hard,\u201d Himes said. \u201cToo many of us had very personal experiences with the people who are serving time or were convicted.\u201d",

      "Four years ago, then-President Donald Trump urged supporters to head to the Capitol to protest Congress' certification of Democrat Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 election.",
      "\u201cWill be wild!\u201d Trump promised on Twitter a few weeks before Jan. 6, 2021. And it was.",
      "Trump gave a vitriolic speech to thousands of people gathered at the Ellipse behind the White House, after which many marched to the Capitol and stormed the building in an attempt to stop the previously routine final step in formalizing the winner of the presidential election. Even after the rioters dispersed, eight Republicans in the Senate and 139 in the House voted against ratifying Biden's win in certain swing states, despite no evidence of problems or wrongdoing that could have affected the outcome.",
      "This year, the only turbulence preceding the quadrennial ratification of the presidential election resulted from House Republicans fighting among themselves over who should be speaker.",
      "\u201cThere will be no violence. There will be no attempt to mount an insurrection against the Constitution,\u201d said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md. \u201cIt will be a lot more like what we\u2019ve seen for the rest of American history.\u201d",
      "The last time, Trump urged his vice president, Mike Pence, who was presiding over the certification, to intervene to keep him in the White House. This time, Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee against Trump, has acknowledged her loss and isn't expected to try to change long-established procedures for certifying the election. No other prominent Democrat has urged the party to contest Trump's win, either.",
      "Congress also has since updated the law that governs the proceeding, clarifying the process in the states and specifying the vice president's role as merely ministerial.",
      "After the 2020 election, many Republicans contended there were signs of massive voter fraud that made it impossible to confirm Biden's victory, even though there has never been any indication of widespread fraud. After Trump won this November, many of those same Republicans had no such objections, saying they trusted the accuracy of the vote count. It was a change in sentiment shared by Republicans across the country.",
      "\u201cAs citizens, we should all be happy when it goes smoothly,\u201d said Edward Foley, a law professor at Ohio State University. \u201cIt's always better not to have major contestation over elections, especially when there isn't a reasonable position for it.\u201d",
      "Still, the calm may be illusory.",
      "Trump and Republicans had signaled that if had Harris won, they were prepared to contest her victory. Vice President-elect JD Vance, as an Ohio senator, argued that Pence should have acted to overturn Biden's election.",
      "Vance himself is set to be in the position to preside over the next significant Jan. 6 \u2014 in 2029, when Congress will be scheduled to accept the electoral votes for the winner of the 2028 presidential election.",
      "\u201cThe most dangerous January 6 event is not January 6, 2025. It\u2019s January 6, 2029, and beyond,\u201d said David Weinberg of Protect Democracy, which defends against what it terms authoritarian threats to the country. \u201cIt creates an enormous problem when only one side of the aisle stands down when it loses an election.\u201d",
      "The Constitution lays out some basic steps required to choose the next president, and congressional legislation has filled in the procedural blanks. After states choose their winning candidates on Election Day, electors who are pledged to vote for those candidates meet as the Electoral College and formally cast their votes for president.",
      "Congress then tallies the votes on Jan. 6 in a joint session presided over by the vice president to formally determine who's won a majority of the Electoral College.",
      "In 2021, Trump pushed for Pence not to read out the tallies from swing states that Biden won, thereby forcing Congress to vote to accept a list of states where Trump won the majority of the Electoral College. That ploy was something that Pence and numerous legal scholars said was an unconstitutional act.",
      "A year later, Biden signed the bipartisan bill that updated the 1887 law governing the joint session to make clear the vice president needs to read all of the state tallies. The Electoral Count Reform Act also makes it harder to object to the congressional vote.",
      "Still, many House Republicans remain opposed to that law.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., was a prime supporter of Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 loss and had not ruled out trying to change the election outcome if Trump lost in November. Republicans spent the final weeks of the election contending Democrats would do the same if Trump won, citing a push by some to disqualify the former president from the ballot under the Constitution's once-obscure \u201cinsurrection clause.\" That effort ultimately was rebuffed by the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Republicans say the size of Trump's election victory is why there is no potential unrest. He won the presidency by about 230,000 votes in the swing states and the popular vote by 1.5 percentage points after losing by about 44,000 votes in the swing states and 4.5 percentage points nationwide in 2020.",
      "\u201cThis time, I think the win was so decisive that it just \u2014 for good or ill depending on which side you\u2019re on \u2014 it\u2019s stifled most of that,\" said Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs, a Republican who led the objections on Jan. 6, 2021, over groundless allegations of voter fraud.",
      "Foley, author of the book \u201cBallot Battles\u201d about election challenges in U.S. history, advised Congress on changes to the law governing the joint session and its certification of the presidential election. He said he hoped the 2024 election marks the end of groundless challenges to congressional certification, even though the candidate who spearheaded the last challenge won.",
      "That's because Trump has said he won't run again and is constitutionally barred from seeking a third term. Foley noted that, in 2022, a number of Republicans tried to mimic Trump's distrust of election results and widely lost in swing states. Election denial, he said, may not be viable if not attached to Trump.",
      "\u201cAs Trump will never be a candidate again,\u201d Foley said, \u201cI hope this is beyond us.\u201d",

      "State Department tells Congress of a planned $8 billion weapons sale to Israel.",
      "WASHINGTON -- The State Department has informed Congress of a planned $8 billion weapons sale to Israel, U.S. officials say, as the American ally presses forward with its war against Hamas in Gaza.",
      "Some of the arms in the package could be sent through current U.S. stocks but the majority would take a year or several years to deliver, according to two U.S. officials Saturday who spoke on condition of anonymity because the notification to Congress hasn't been formally sent.",
      "The sale includes medium-range air-to-air missiles to help Israel defend against airborne threats, 155 mm projectile artillery shells for long-range targeting, Hellfire AGM-114 missiles, 500-pound bombs and more.",
      "The weapons package would add to a record of at least $17.9 billion in military aid that the U.S. has provided Israel since the Hamas attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, launched the war.",
      "The Biden administration has faced criticism over mounting deaths of Palestinian civilians. There have been demonstrations on college campuses and unsuccessful efforts in Congress by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and some Democrats to block sales of offensive weapons to Israel.",
      "The United States paused a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel in May over concerns about civilian casualties if the bombs were to be used during an assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah. The Biden administration has demanded that Israel increase humanitarian aid into the enclave. But in November, citing some limited progress, it declined to limit arms transfers as it threatened to do if the situation did not improve.",
      "In recent days, Israel has been conducting airstrikes in Gaza that have killed dozens of people, adding to the tens of thousands of deaths since the war began more than a year ago.",
      "The Israeli army said Friday that it had struck dozens of Hamas gathering points and command centers throughout Gaza. Israel\u2019s military says it only targets militants and blames Hamas for civilian deaths because its fighters operate in dense residential areas.",
      "The war has caused widespread destruction and displaced about 90% of Gaza\u2019s population of 2.3 million, many of them multiple times. Winter has now arrived, and hundreds of thousands are sheltering in tents near the sea.",
      "The informal notice to Congress isn\u2019t the final notification before a sale. Now the leaders of the House Foreign Affairs Committee or the Senate Foreign Relations Committee can review the package.",
      "News of the weapons sale was first reported by Axios.",

      "Sarah McBride will become the first transgender member of Congress.",
      "Three newly elected lawmakers representing the LGBTQ community will make history Friday when they are sworn in to the 119th Congress, marking several firsts in the House of Representatives.",
      "Sarah McBride will be the first openly transgender member of Congress. She will represent Delaware\u2019s sole congressional district in the House of Representatives after more than three years in the state Senate, which marked a historic first for trans representation at the state senate level.",
      "Julie Johnson, set to be the first LGBTQ+ member of Congress from the South, had served in the Texas state legislature since 2018. In her campaign for the congressional seat, she touted her record in fighting anti-LGBTQ bills on the state level among her passions as a legislator.",
      "Emily Randall will be the first LGBTQ Latina in Congress after serving as a Washington state senator since 2018.",
      "The 118th Congress set the record for having the most LGBTQ representation in U.S. history, with 13 legislators openly identifying as gay, lesbian or bisexual. This year's slate of members being sworn in are doing so as the country experiences growing anti-LGBTQ rhetoric and violence.",
      "In the 2024 state legislative session, the ACLU tracked more than 500 bills they say are \"anti-LGBTQ.\" Transgender people -- who make up less than 1% of Americans over the age of 13, according to UCLA's research organization, the Williams Institute -- have particularly been the subjects of such legislation, including restrictions on bathroom use for transgender residents, bans on gender-affirming care, and more.",
      "In recent years, federal and local authorities have warned about the increase in violence against the LGBTQ community.",
      "McBride has received backlash from some colleagues ahead of her swearing in. Republican Rep. Nancy Mace introduced a bill in November to restrict transgender women from using women's restrooms at the U.S. Capitol, saying the bill was \"absolutely\" in response to McBride's entering Congress. She cited concerns about her safety in restrooms, to which McBride responded by calling the bill a distraction. The bill is now dead.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson said transgender women cannot use women's restrooms, changing rooms or locker rooms in the Capitol and House office buildings. In terms of how Johnson plans to enforce this policy is not entirely clear if he's elected Speaker again, but the speaker has \"general control\" of facilities, according to House rules.",
      "McBride responded to the order by saying, \"I\u2019m not here to fight about bathrooms. I\u2019m here to fight for Delawareans and to bring down costs facing families. Like all members, I will follow the rules as outlined by Speaker Johnson, even if I disagree with them.",
      "LGBTQ groups have applauded the incoming legislators \"when the fight for equality and justice faces unprecedented opposition,\" said Human Rights Campaign President Kelley Robinson in a statement to ABC News.",
      "\u201cThe American people deserve a bold vision for our country, one led by champions who bring experiences to the table that have often gone unheard,\u201d Robinson said in the statement. \"They have proven themselves to be leaders through their lived examples and their careers in advancing equality and civil rights. It\u2019s why we were proud to mobilize our grassroots forces last year to support them in their races so that every LGBTQ+ American knows that they have a voice in Washington.\"",

    "summary": "There are no known threats to the state funeral for Carter, but it is an attractive target \"for violent extremists to attack,\" according to a new security assessment.",
    "story": [
      "There are no known threats to Carter's state funeral.",
      "The state funeral for former President Jimmy Carter is an attractive target \"for violent extremists to attack,\" especially after the vehicle ramming in New Orleans that killed 14 people, though there are no known threats to the funeral, according to a new security assessment obtained by ABC News.",
      "\"State funerals are considered no-notice events that significantly reduce planning timelines for potential hostile actors,\" the document said. \"However, state funerals still present attractive targets due to the large gathering of senior US government officials, foreign dignitaries, and heads of state, as well as the symbolic nature of the venues and media attention expected.\"",
      "Carter, who died on Dec. 29 at the age of 100, will be honored with a state funeral at Washington National Cathedral on Thursday. President Joe Biden will deliver a eulogy and President-elect Donald Trump is expected to attend.",
      "The memorials for Carter begin on Saturday when he's transferred from his hometown of Plains, Georgia, to Atlanta. A ceremony will be held at the Carter Presidential Center in Atlanta on Saturday afternoon.",
      "Carter's remains will be transferred to Washington, D.C., on Tuesday and he will lie in state at the Capitol from Tuesday to Thursday. After the service at Washington National Cathedral, Carter's remains will return to Plains.",
      "The assessment also noted other specially designated security events this month, including the certification of the Electoral College on Jan. 6 and Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. The simultaneous events \"may increase the perception of a target-rich environment for a variety of threat actors,\" the document said.",
      "\"Targets could include the planned special events and ceremonies related to the State Funeral and associated First Amendment-protected activities around these ceremonies,\" the assessment said. \"While there is no indication that the intersection of these two events will lead to an increased threat picture, the potentially large crowds for both may provide an attractive target to threat actors.\"",
      "Law enforcement officials said there are no known threats to Washington, D.C., but the city will remain on a heightened threat environment throughout the month.",
      "The D.C. National Guard said it's been activated and the Secret Service said it's deploying agents and specialists from field offices across the country to supplement staffing. The local D.C. police department has also been fully activated and will have nearly 4,000 additional officers from across the country assisting with policing for the special events.",
      "White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Friday that the Department of Homeland Security and federal law enforcement have been preparing for months to ensure the security of the events and the safety of those attending, with \"well established\" protocols in place.",
      "The document also specifically mentioned the New Year's attack in New Orleans, noting \"the use of vehicle-ramming alone or in conjunction with other tactics has become a recurring tactic employed by violent threat actors in the West.\"",
      "The document added that \"large crowds gathering in publicly accessible locations to observe or participate in State Funeral events could become targets of opportunity for a vehicle attack.\"",
      "Fourteen people were killed and dozens were hurt when a man drove a truck through crowds on Bourbon Street early on New Year's Day. The suspect, who also died in the attack, posted several videos online \"proclaiming his support for ISIS,\" and mentioning he joined ISIS before this summer, according to the FBI.",

    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 20:20:27 -0500",
    "summary": "The impact of his single-term foreign policy is still felt around the globe.",
    "story": [
      "The impact of his single-term foreign policy is still felt around the globe.",
      "A generous description of former President Jimmy Carter's foreign policy track record during his four tumultuous years in the White House would be one defined by peaks and valleys.",
      "There were highlights. Many see Carter's role in brokering the Camp David Accords, a revolutionary set of treaties between Israel and Egypt that would forever change the diplomatic landscape of the Middle East, as the foreign policy apex of his presidency.",
      "But there were also stinging failures, including the Iran hostage crisis -- a 444-day chapter of Carter's term during which 53 American diplomats and private citizens were held captive inside the U.S. embassy in Tehran.",
      "However, historians and analysts say understanding Carter's true impact requires looking far beyond the relatively short time he spent as leader of the free world, and that the former president -- once rejected as a failure -- has wielded an outsize influence on international affairs that will reverberate for years to come.",
      "When Carter left the White House in 1981, it was under a cloud of failure. In the wake of his punishing defeat by Ronald Reagan, Carter told one of his biographers that he was hopelessly distraught and wanted nothing more than to lie low in his native Georgia.",
      "That all changed, he said, when a cataclysmic event sent shockwaves through the Middle East: the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.",
      "Carter had worked alongside Sadat to broker the Camp David Accords, and in the process, the world leaders forged a deep, personal bond.",
      "While Carter was celebrated for his part in the negotiations, Sadat was lambasted by his own countrymen. Carter said he viewed the Egyptian leader's death at the hands of jihadists as Sadat paying the ultimate price for peace they had brokered in the wooded mountains of Maryland.",
      "Carter later credited that sacrifice for pulling him from his despair and eventually leading him to found The Carter Presidential Center -- a multifaceted nonprofit aimed at promoting human rights, with missions as varied as election monitoring and eradicating parasitic diseases.",
      "However, Carter's focus on easing suffering around the world was not a post-presidential pursuit so much as a return to form.",
      "On the campaign trail in the mid-1970s, Carter had vowed to make advancing human rights a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy -- a significant shift for the time.",
      "\"Because we are free, we can never be indifferent to the fate of freedom elsewhere. Our moral sense dictates a clear-cut preference for those societies which share with us an abiding respect for individual human rights,\" he declared in his inaugural address.",
      "That sentiment is what drove Carter in 1979 to conclude negotiations with Panama aimed at giving the Central American nation control of the Panama Canal, administered by the U.S since construction began in 1904 (and now something President-elect Donald Trump is threatening to reassert).",
      "The State Department credits that development for enabling \"the United States to defend itself from charges of imperialism made by Soviet-aligned states\" and boosting cooperating between the U.S. and Panama.",
      "Yet, despite Carter's intentions, he sometimes wavered, and the actions he took in pursuit of his self-described \"fairness not force\" doctrine were prone to backfire, according to Ray Takeyh, a senior fellow for Middle East studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\"Carter was a foreign policy neophyte, idealistic about efforts to achieve Middle East peace and driven by a Christian faith that informed his vocal but inconsistent focus on human rights,\" he said.",
      "Takeyh points to Carter's decision to turn a blind eye towards human rights abuses committed by the Iranian shah's government -- an influential partner in the fight against Soviet influence -- as an example of that inconsistency.",
      "Carter's critics say that blind spot also obscured the looming Iranian revolution and clouded his judgment of the newly installed regime, setting in motion a series of decisions that would foment the hostage crises and irreparably sour relations between Washington and Tehran.",
      "After Carter was once again caught off-guard by the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, he \"responded with increasingly hawkish actions,\" including \"an aggressive national security strategy focused on the Persian Gulf and the wider Middle East\" -- foreshadowing the decades of war in the region to come, according to Takeyh.",
      "However, other analysts argue that Carter's open embrace of human rights was actually a subtle success -- but one that took years to come fully into focus.",
      "Reagan, Carter's successor, is often credited with bringing about the collapse of the Soviet Union, and with it, the end of the Cold War. But Daniel Fried, a former U.S ambassador to Poland and distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council, argues that Carter's contributions are overlooked.",
      "\"Introducing human rights into U.S. bilateral relations meant that the default Cold War policy that a reliably anticommunist government could be embraced,\" Fried said, adding that it meant tolerating authoritarian rule was \"no longer automatic.\"",
      "\"By elevating human rights in the mix of U.S.-Soviet and U.S.-Soviet bloc relations, Carter put the United States on offense in the Cold War and on the side of the people of the region,\" he added.",
      "Leslie Vinjamuri, director of the U.S. and Americans program at Chatham House, describes Carter's elevation of human rights as \"visionary.\"",
      "\"It came at a time when the promotion of human rights was seen to be at odds with the more central priorities of a superpower during the Cold War,\" she said.",
      "Vinjamuri says that approach continued to serve Carter in the four decades following his time in the White House as he pushed to advance peace and democracy around the world, orchestrating missions to Bosnia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Haiti.",
      "Still Carter's willingness to put people and personal relationships at the heart of foreign diplomacy can be seen as either a bug or a feature of his approach.",
      "Both during and after his presidency, Carter's willingness to meet face-to-face with communist leaders and deepen ties with the nations they led repeatedly sparked controversy.",
      "In 1979, Carter severed formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan -- choosing to recognize Beijing as the sole legal government of China, effectively creating Washington's \"One China policy.\"",
      "Congress swiftly retaliated by passing the Taiwan Relations Act, requiring the U.S. to provide defensive arms to Taiwan -- legislation that Carter signed. The two steps, seemingly at odds, set the tone for the complicated and deeply consequential relationship between the powers that exists to this very day.",
      "More than two decades later, Carter became the first president in or out of office to visit Cuba since the country's revolution in 1959. While some heralded the 2002 trip as a groundbreaking step to promote democracy that cemented Carter's status as an accomplished statesman, others slammed the former president -- accusing him of legitimizing Cuba's President Fidel Castro and his regime.",
      "But Carter's willingness to cross boundaries in pursuit of what he saw as global good did not end with world leaders.",
      "The same year Carter traveled to Cuba, he also journeyed to Africa -- visiting several countries where the AIDS/HIV epidemic was still ravaging populations and deeply stigmatizing.",
      "There, alongside former South African President Nelson Mandela, Carter cradled babies infected with the virus, lovingly holding the infants as cameras snapped pictures.",
      "Dr. Helene Gayle, the president of Spelmen College, who accompanied Mandela and Carter on the trip, says it's a scene she will never forget.",
      "\"They wanted to show everyone that these babies were no harm to anyone, including world leaders,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Sen. John Thune used his first few minutes of floor time to make a commitment to defend the filibuster rule, which requires at least 60 votes to pass Senate legislation.",
    "story": [
      "Thune's comments came just after the Senate gaveled in to begin its new session.",
      "In his maiden floor speech as Senate majority leader, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota used his first few minutes of floor time to make a commitment to defend the filibuster rule, which requires at least 60 votes to pass legislation in the Senate.",
      "\"One of my priorities as leader will be to ensure that the Senate stays the Senate,\" Thune said. \"That means preserving the legislative filibuster, the Senate rule that today has perhaps the greatest impact on preserving the founders' visions of the United States Senate.\"",
      "Thune's comments came just after the Senate gaveled in to begin its new session.",
      "During the opening of the new Congress, Vice President Kamala Harris swore in all 32 Senators elected in November, including 12 freshman members, some of whom helped to deliver a new Republican majority in the upper chamber.",
      "In this new Senate, Republicans have 53 seats, a three-seat majority that gives them a comfortable edge in confirming President-elect Donald Trump's nominees to his Cabinet and the federal bench since these nominations only require 50 votes for confirmation.",
      "But the Senate rules currently require 60 votes to pass legislation. If Thune holds true to his commitment to uphold this rule, that means the majority of legislative matters will require the buy-in of at least seven Senate Democrats or independents who caucus with Democrats. It keeps compromise front and center in the upper chamber.",
      "Thune's speech Friday afternoon is not the first time that he has made a commitment to uphold the Senate's 60-vote threshold, which Democrats unsuccessfully attempted to sidestep to pass voting rights legislation in 2022. Thune made the protection of the filibuster part of his campaign to become majority leader and has since spoken on the floor to the same.",
      "But the fact that Thune, who will no doubt undergo scrutiny from Trump for any failure to move his legislative agenda across the finish line swiftly, chose to use his first moments on the Senate floor as Republican leader to affirm his commitment to the 60-vote threshold is notable.",
      "Trump attempted to pressure Republicans to put the legislative filibuster rule aside in 2018, when Trump was in office for the first time and Republicans controlled the Senate. It was then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell who prevented the Senate from taking that step. Democrats similarly signaled last year that they were interested in exploring a revision of the rule if they managed to keep control of the Senate, which they did not.",
      "Thune's comments on the floor today signal that he won't cave to Trump if the president-elect grows frustrated by the Senate's inability to swiftly move legislation that does not have any Democratic support and once again mounts a pressure campaign to change the rule.",
      "\"Unfortunately, today there are a lot of people out there who would like to see the Senate turn into a copy of the House of Representatives, and that is not what our founders intended or what our country needs,\" Thune said.",
      "Republicans will have the ability to attempt to implement major policy changes without any Democratic support using a procedural tool called budget reconciliation, which only requires a simple majority of votes to pass the chamber. But the razor-thin GOP majority in the House means a reconciliation package will also be a challenge to cobble together.",
      "All other legislation will require 60 votes to pass.",
      "Thune said the Senate will have a laundry list of things it hopes to accomplish during the 119th Congress, including border security, tax reform, defense spending changes and larger government funding discussions.",
      "Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer, who is now the minority leader in this new Senate, said Democrats will do their part to try to work with Republicans where possible, citing a string of bipartisan wins in previous years.",
      "\"I want to work with the new Republican leader to keep that bipartisan streak going in the new year,\" Schumer said. \"I don't expect we will agree on everything or even many things, but there will still be opportunities to improve the lives of the American people if we are willing to work together.\"",
      "Schumer, who spoke out repeatedly against Trump prior to the 2024 election, said Democrats are ready to move forward from the election.",
      "\"For first time in a long time, the next president will be someone we've seen before: President-elect Trump will return to the Oval Office,\" Schumer said. \"In the first day of the 119th Congress, I'd like to take a moment to talk about how Senate Democrats will approach the next two years. It can be summarized like this: Democrats stand united not because of who we fight against but because of who we are fighting for -- the American people.\"",
      "He also congratulated Thune on his assumption of the role as majority leader.",
      "Thune fills the role of McConnell, who stepped down from leadership after 18 years at the helm of the Senate Republican Conference. Friday was Thune's first day as party leader despite winning an election to the position in November.",
      "Thune said he will \"work every day\" to be worthy of the trust his party members have put in him as their new leader.",

      "Sixty years after Black Americans gained the right to vote in the United States through the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Sen. Tim Scott on Friday makes history, becoming the longest-serving African American in the 235-year history of the United States Senate. This historic moment will be shared alongside four other African-American senators, making this the largest group of Black senators to ever serve concurrently in the U.S. Capitol, a building constructed with the labor of enslaved Black people.",
      "The previous longest-serving Black senator was the late Republican Sen. Edward Brooke of Massachusetts, who held office from 1967 until 1979. Scott, the first elected Black senator from the South, is the first to serve in both the House of Representatives and the Senate.",
      "In his first speech as a freshman senator, Scott said, \"I believe in the greatness of America because I have experienced the goodness of our people in America. An ordinary guy like me can be blessed with an extraordinary opportunity like this.\"",
      "Born and raised in North Charleston, South Carolina, Scott was raised in a single-parent household after the divorce of his parents. He was a troubled teenager who failed English, Spanish, geography, and civics in his freshman year in High School. He often recalls his close relationship with his grandfather, who was forced to drop out of school in the third grade, picked cotton to survive, and was not allowed to vote for more than half of his life. His grandfather was also unable to learn how to read, only to witness his grandson's career rise from those humble beginnings in South Carolina to become both a member of Congress and a U.S. senator.",
      "\"Our family went from cotton to Congress in one lifetime,\" Scott said at the Republican National Convention in 2020.",
      "After serving in the House of Representatives from 2011 until 2013, Scott was appointed by then-South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley to the Senate in 2012 after former Senator Jim DeMint left to become president of the Heritage Foundation. Democratic Senator Cory Booker, who was elected in a special election did not join the Senate until months after Scott's appointment.",
      "In 2024, the Senate will see its highest-ever Black senators serving concurrently. This group includes Sens. Raphael Warnock, Booker, Scott, Angela Alsobrooks, and Lisa Blunt Rochester. Rochester and Alsobrooks will also break barriers as the first two women to serve together in the Senate concurrently.",
      "During his early days in the Senate, Scott occasionally would serve as the only Black person in the Senate. In 2016, following the controversial deaths of Eric Garner, Walter Scott, and Philando Castile he delivered a poignant speech about the deep divide between law enforcement and communities in America. He revealed that, as an elected official, he had been stopped and questioned seven times while driving. Even as a senator, Scott was questioned about his identity by Capitol Police despite wearing a pin identifying himenator.",
      "\"While I thank God I have not endured bodily harm, I have, however, felt the pressure applied by the scales of justice when they are slanted. I have felt the anger, the frustration, the sadness, and the humiliation that comes with feeling like you're being targeted for nothing more than being just yourself,\" Scott said in 2016.",
      "As his career extends into the 119th Congress, Scott will make history as the first Black chairman of a Senate standing committee. He will lead the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee and will also chair the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the only Black Republican to hold such a position.",
      "Marking the milestone achievement, Scott said in a statement, \"My goal is simple: make America work for Americans. As we get to work cleaning up the mess from the previous administration, I look forward to working with President Trump on his priorities, including paving a path for all Americans to have the necessary tools and resources to achieve their version of the American Dream.\"",

      "WASHINGTON -- The fourth anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol has a new focus as lawmakers brace for the prospect that President-elect Donald Trump may soon pardon many of the more than 1,500 people charged with crimes for their actions related to the riot.",
      "Trump said he would issue pardons to rioters on \u201cDay 1\u201d of his presidency, which begins Jan. 20. \u201cMost likely, I\u2019ll do it very quickly,\u201d he said recently on NBC's \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d He added that \u201cthose people have suffered long and hard. And there may be some exceptions to it. I have to look. But, you know, if somebody was radical, crazy.\u201d",

      "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said she has spoken at length with Trump and is lobbying him to pardon everyone who participated in the siege. Few Republicans are going that far, but many believe it\u2019s appropriate for Trump to look at pardons on a case-by-case basis.",

Even the ones that fought Capitol Police, caused damage to the Capitol, I think they\u2019ve served their time and I think they should all be pardoned and released from prison,\" Greene said. \"Some of these people have been given prison sentences: 10 years, 18 years and more. I think it\u2019s an injustice. It\u2019s a two-tiered justice system, and it\u2019s time to end it.\u201d",
      "More than 1,250 have pleaded guilty or been convicted after trials in connection with Jan. 6, with more than 650 receiving prison time ranging from a few days to 22 years.",
      "Many of those who broke into the Capitol were echoing Trump\u2019s false claims about election fraud. Some rioters menacingly called out the names of prominent politicians \u2014 particularly then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and then-Vice President Mike Pence, who refused to try to object to Biden\u2019s win. Lawmakers who had evacuated both chambers on Jan. 6 returned that night to finish their work.",
      "Police officers who defended the Capitol are particularly incensed about the possible pardons. Many officers were beaten, some with their own weapons, as they tried to hold back the mob. About 140 officers were injured on Jan. 6, making it \u201clikely the largest single day mass assault of law enforcement\u201d in American history, Matthew Graves, the outgoing U.S. attorney in the nation's capital, has said.",
      "\u201cYou cannot be pro-police officer and rule of law if you are pardoning people who betrayed that trust, injured police officers and ransacked the Capitol,\u201d said Capitol Police Sgt. Aquilino Gonell, who retired due to his injuries after fighting rioters.",
      "Some Republicans in Congress, even those closely aligned with Trump, suggested not all Jan. 6 offenders should be treated the same.",
      "Rep. Jim Jordan, a top Trump ally who leads the House Judiciary Committee, said he supported some pardons, but also made a distinction.",
      "\u201cFor people who didn\u2019t commit any violence, I think everyone supports that. I think that makes sense,\u201d said Jordan, R-Ohio.",
      "Veteran Republican Rep. Gus Bilirakis, R-Fla., also wasn't ready to go as far as Greene. \"You've got to look at it individually. Some probably deserve to be pardoned,\u201d he said.",
      "But he was more reticent when asked if those who attacked U.S. Capitol police officers should be among those pardoned.",
      "\u201cMy goodness. Again, I'd have to look at the scenario,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if they attacked the U.S. Capitol Police, it's a big problem.\u201d",
      "Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., said not every single charge is the same and that people who were trespassing are a different category from those who entered the Capitol and damaged property. He said he believes Trump will look at each individual circumstance and decide what is appropriate.",
      "\u201cPeople who attacked police officers, listen, I don't think that is something we should ever condone,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "House Democrats, who led the drive to impeach Trump over Jan. 6 and conducted a wide-ranging investigation into the attack, warned that the pardons could have far-reaching consequences, both for the rule of law and the security of the country. Members of the extremist Oath Keepers and Proud Boys, for instance, were convicted of seditious conspiracy and other crimes in relation to the insurrection.",
      "\u201cThose 140-odd law enforcement people who got hurt defending this institution, I think anyone who loves peace and security would be offended that you would pardon people who attacked those individuals for doing their jobs,\u201d said Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss.",
      "Thompson led the House committee that investigated the events surrounding Jan. 6, concluding with a report that said Trump \u201clit the fire\" for the insurrection.",
      "Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., who served as lead impeachment manager during Trump's second impeachment trial in which he was acquitted, said if pardons are going to happen, people should demand contrition and repentance from each of those pardoned and an affirmative statement they pose no further threat to public safety.",
      "\u201cBecause anything that happens by these people, in a political context or some other context, will essentially be laid at the doorstep soon-to-be President Donald Trump,\u201d Raskin said.",
      "Like police officers who protected them, lawmakers who were in the Capitol during the attack have a visceral reaction to the pardon talk, having barely escaped a mob that seemed determined to do them harm.",
      "Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., who was trapped in the House gallery as rioters tried to break in below, said it would be \u201cextraordinarily difficult\u201d for him and many others if Trump goes ahead with the pardons.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m pretty controlled and pretty disciplined, but that would be really hard,\u201d Himes said. \u201cToo many of us had very personal experiences with the people who are serving time or were convicted.\u201d",

      "This Jan. 6 won't be the same.",
      "Four years ago, then-President Donald Trump urged supporters to head to the Capitol to protest Congress' certification of Democrat Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 election.",
      "\u201cWill be wild!\u201d Trump promised on Twitter a few weeks before Jan. 6, 2021. And it was.",
      "Trump gave a vitriolic speech to thousands of people gathered at the Ellipse behind the White House, after which many marched to the Capitol and stormed the building in an attempt to stop the previously routine final step in formalizing the winner of the presidential election. Even after the rioters dispersed, eight Republicans in the Senate and 139 in the House voted against ratifying Biden's win in certain swing states, despite no evidence of problems or wrongdoing that could have affected the outcome.",
      "This year, the only turbulence preceding the quadrennial ratification of the presidential election resulted from House Republicans fighting among themselves over who should be speaker.",
      "\u201cThere will be no violence. There will be no attempt to mount an insurrection against the Constitution,\u201d said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md. \u201cIt will be a lot more like what we\u2019ve seen for the rest of American history.\u201d",
      "The last time, Trump urged his vice president, Mike Pence, who was presiding over the certification, to intervene to keep him in the White House. This time, Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee against Trump, has acknowledged her loss and isn't expected to try to change long-established procedures for certifying the election. No other prominent Democrat has urged the party to contest Trump's win, either.",
      "Congress also has since updated the law that governs the proceeding, clarifying the process in the states and specifying the vice president's role as merely ministerial.",
      "After the 2020 election, many Republicans contended there were signs of massive voter fraud that made it impossible to confirm Biden's victory, even though there has never been any indication of widespread fraud. After Trump won this November, many of those same Republicans had no such objections, saying they trusted the accuracy of the vote count. It was a change in sentiment shared by Republicans across the country.",
      "\u201cAs citizens, we should all be happy when it goes smoothly,\u201d said Edward Foley, a law professor at Ohio State University. \u201cIt's always better not to have major contestation over elections, especially when there isn't a reasonable position for it.\u201d",
      "Still, the calm may be illusory.",
      "Trump and Republicans had signaled that if had Harris won, they were prepared to contest her victory. Vice President-elect JD Vance, as an Ohio senator, argued that Pence should have acted to overturn Biden's election.",
      "Vance himself is set to be in the position to preside over the next significant Jan. 6 \u2014 in 2029, when Congress will be scheduled to accept the electoral votes for the winner of the 2028 presidential election.",
      "\u201cThe most dangerous January 6 event is not January 6, 2025. It\u2019s January 6, 2029, and beyond,\u201d said David Weinberg of Protect Democracy, which defends against what it terms authoritarian threats to the country. \u201cIt creates an enormous problem when only one side of the aisle stands down when it loses an election.\u201d",
      "The Constitution lays out some basic steps required to choose the next president, and congressional legislation has filled in the procedural blanks. After states choose their winning candidates on Election Day, electors who are pledged to vote for those candidates meet as the Electoral College and formally cast their votes for president.",
      "Congress then tallies the votes on Jan. 6 in a joint session presided over by the vice president to formally determine who's won a majority of the Electoral College.",
      "In 2021, Trump pushed for Pence not to read out the tallies from swing states that Biden won, thereby forcing Congress to vote to accept a list of states where Trump won the majority of the Electoral College. That ploy was something that Pence and numerous legal scholars said was an unconstitutional act.",
      "A year later, Biden signed the bipartisan bill that updated the 1887 law governing the joint session to make clear the vice president needs to read all of the state tallies. The Electoral Count Reform Act also makes it harder to object to the congressional vote.",
      "Still, many House Republicans remain opposed to that law.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., was a prime supporter of Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 loss and had not ruled out trying to change the election outcome if Trump lost in November. Republicans spent the final weeks of the election contending Democrats would do the same if Trump won, citing a push by some to disqualify the former president from the ballot under the Constitution's once-obscure \u201cinsurrection clause.\" That effort ultimately was rebuffed by the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Republicans say the size of Trump's election victory is why there is no potential unrest. He won the presidency by about 230,000 votes in the swing states and the popular vote by 1.5 percentage points after losing by about 44,000 votes in the swing states and 4.5 percentage points nationwide in 2020.",
      "\u201cThis time, I think the win was so decisive that it just \u2014 for good or ill depending on which side you\u2019re on \u2014 it\u2019s stifled most of that,\" said Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs, a Republican who led the objections on Jan. 6, 2021, over groundless allegations of voter fraud.",
      "Foley, author of the book \u201cBallot Battles\u201d about election challenges in U.S. history, advised Congress on changes to the law governing the joint session and its certification of the presidential election. He said he hoped the 2024 election marks the end of groundless challenges to congressional certification, even though the candidate who spearheaded the last challenge won.",
      "That's because Trump has said he won't run again and is constitutionally barred from seeking a third term. Foley noted that, in 2022, a number of Republicans tried to mimic Trump's distrust of election results and widely lost in swing states. Election denial, he said, may not be viable if not attached to Trump.",
      "\u201cAs Trump will never be a candidate again,\u201d Foley said, \u201cI hope this is beyond us.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The fate of TikTok is keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision from the Supreme Court that could upheld their livelihoods",
      "Will TikTok be banned this month?",
      "That\u2019s the pressing question keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision that could upend their livelihoods. The fate of the popular app will be decided by the Supreme Court, which will hear arguments on Jan. 10 over a law requiring TikTok to break ties with its Chinese-based parent company, ByteDance, or face a U.S. ban.",
      "At the heart of the case is whether the law violates the First Amendment with TikTok and its creator allies arguing that it does. The U.S. government, which sees the platform as a national security risk, says it does not.",
      "For creators, the TikTok doomsday scenarios are nothing new since President-elect Donald Trump first tried to ban the platform through executive order during his first term. But despite Trump's recent statements indicating he now wants TikTok to stick around, the prospect of a ban has never been as immediate as it is now with the Supreme Court serving as the final arbiter.",
      "If the government prevails as it did in a lower court, TikTok says it would shut down its U.S. platform by Jan. 19, leaving creators scrambling to redefine their futures.",
      "\u201cA lot of my other creative friends, we're all like freaking out. But I'm staying calm,\u201d said Gillian Johnson, who benefited financially from TikTok\u2019s live feature and rewards program, which helped creators generate higher revenue potential by posting high-quality original content. The 22-year-old filmmaker and recent college graduate uses her TikTok earnings to help fund her equipment for projects such as camera lens and editing software for her short films \u201cGambit\u201d and \u201cAwaken! My Neighbor.\u201d",
      "Johnson said the idea of TikTok going away is \u201chard to accept.\u201d",
      "Many creators have taken to TikTok to voice their frustrations, grappling with the possibility that the platform they\u2019ve invested so much in could soon disappear. Online communities risk being disrupted, and the economic fallout could especially be devastating for those who mainly depend on TikTok and have left full-time jobs to build careers and incomes around their content.",
      "For some, the uncertainty has led them to question whether to continue creating content at all, according to Johnson, who says she knows creators who have been thinking about quitting. But Nicla Bartoli, the vice president of sales at The Influencer Marketing Factory, said the creators she has interreacted with have not been too worried since news about a potential TikTok ban has come up repeatedly over the years, and then died down.",
      "\u201cI believe a good chunk think it is not going to happen,\" said Bartoli, whose agency works to pair influencers and brands.",
      "It's unclear how quickly the Supreme Court will issue a decision. But the court could act swiftly to block the law from going into effect if at least five of the nine justices deem it unconstitutional.",
      "Trump, for his part, has already asked the justices to put a pause on the ban so he could weigh in after he takes office. In a brief \u2014 written by his pick for solicitor general \u2014 Trump called the First Amendment implications of a TikTok ban \u201csweeping and troubling\" and said he wants a \u201cnegotiated resolution\u201d to the issue, something the Biden administration had pursued to no avail.",
      "While waiting for the dust to settle in Washington, some creators are exploring alternatives ways to promote themselves or their business, encouraging users to follow them on other social media platforms or are investing more time producing non-TikTok content.",
      "Johnson says she is already strategizing her next move and exploring alternative opportunities. While she hasn\u2019t found a place quite like TikTok, she\u2019s begun to spend more of her time on other platforms, such as Instagram and YouTube, both of whom are expected to benefit financially if TikTok vanishes.",
      "According to a report by Goldman Sachs, the so-called creator economy, which has been fueled in part by TikTok, could be worth $480 billion by 2027.",
      "Because the opportunity to monetize content exists across a range of platforms, a vast amount of creators have already diversified their social media presence. However, many TikTok creators have credited the platform \u2014 and its algorithm \u2014 with giving them a type of exposure they did not receive on other platforms. Some say it has also boosted and provided opportunities for creators of color and those from other marginalized groups.",
      "Despite fears about the fate of TikTok, industry analysts note creators are generally avoiding making any big changes, like abandoning platform, until something actually happens.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m anxious but also trying to be hopeful in a weird way,\" said Brandon Hurst, who credits TikTok with rescuing his business from obscurity and propelling it into rapid growth.",
      "A year after joining TikTok, the 30-year-old Hurst, who sells plants, said his sales doubled, outpacing the traction he\u2019d struggled to gain on Instagram. He built his clientele through the live feature on TikTok, which has helped him sell more than 77,000 plants. The business has thrived so much that he says he now employs five people, including his husband and mom.",
      "\"For me, this has been my sole way of doing business,\" Hurst said.",
      "Billion Dollar Boy, a New York-based influencer marketing agency, has advised creators to download all of their TikTok content into a personal portfolio, which is especially important for those who post primarily on the platform, said Edward East, the agency\u2019s founder and group CEO. This can help them quickly build their audiences elsewhere. Plus it can serve as a resume for brands who might want to partner with them for product advertisements, East said.",
      "But until the deadline of Jan. 19 comes around, East said creators should continue to post regularly on TikTok, which has 170 million month U.S. users and remains highly effective in reaching audiences.",
      "If the Supreme Court does not delay the ban, as Trump is asking them to do, app stores and internet service providers would be required to stop providing service to TikTok by Jan. 19. That means anyone who doesn't have TikTok on their phone would be unable to download it. TikTok users would continue to have access, but the prohibitions \u2014 which will prevent them from updating the app \u2014 will eventually make the app \"unworkable,\u201d the Justice Department has said.",
      "TikTok said in court documents that it estimates a one-month shutdown would cause the platform to lose approximately a third of its daily users in the U.S. The company argues a shutdown, even if temporary, will cause it irreparable harm, a legal bar used by judges to determine whether to put the brakes on a law facing a challenge. In under three weeks, Americans will know if the Supreme Court agrees.",

      "New York\u2019s new toll for drivers entering the center of Manhattan is starting up after it withstood years of political wrangling, a last-minute pause and a flurry of legal challenges",
      "NEW YORK -- New York's new toll for drivers entering the center of Manhattan debuted Sunday, meaning many people will pay $9 to access the busiest part of the Big Apple during peak hours.",
      "The toll, known as congestion pricing, is meant to reduce traffic gridlock in the densely packed city while also raising money to help fix its ailing public transit infrastructure.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been studying this issue for five years. And it only takes about five minutes if you\u2019re in midtown Manhattan to see that New York has a real traffic problem,\" Metropolitan Transportation Authority Chair and CEO Janno Lieber told reporters late Friday after a court hearing that cleared the way for the tolls.",
      "\"We need to make it easier for people who choose to drive, or who have to drive, to get around the city.\"",
      "The cost to drivers depends on what time of the day it is and if drivers have an E-ZPass, an electronic toll collection system that's used in many states.",
      "Most drivers with E-ZPasses will get dinged the $9 fee to enter Manhattan south of Central Park on weekdays between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m. and on weekends between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. During off hours, the toll will be $2.25.",
      "That's on top of tolls drivers pay for crossing various bridges and tunnels to get to the city in the first place, although there will be a credit of up to $3 for those who have already paid to enter Manhattan via certain tunnels during peak hours.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, a Republican, has vowed to kill the program when he takes office, but it's unclear if he will follow through. The plan had stalled during his first term while it waited on a federal environmental review.",
      "In November, Trump, whose namesake Trump Tower is in the toll zone, said congestion pricing \u201cwill put New York City at a disadvantage over competing cities and states, and businesses will flee.\u201d",
      "\u201cNot only is this a massive tax to people coming in, it is extremely inconvenient from both driving and personal booking keeping standards,\" he said in a statement. \"It will be virtually impossible for New York City to come back as long as the congestion tax is in effect.\u201d",
      "Other big cities around the world, including London and Stockholm, have similar congestion pricing schemes, but it is the first in the U.S.",
      "The toll was supposed to go into effect last year with a $15 charge, but Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul abruptly paused the program before the 2024 election, when congressional races in suburban areas around the city \u2014 the epicenter of opposition to the program \u2014 were considered to be vital to her party's effort to retake control of Congress.",
      "Not long after the election, Hochul rebooted the plan but at the lower $9 toll. She denies politics were at play and said she thought the original $15 charge was too much, though she had been a vocal supporter of the program before halting it.",
      "Congestion pricing also survived several lawsuits seeking to block the program, including a last-ditch effort from the state of New Jersey to have a judge put up a temporary roadblock against it. A spokesperson for New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, Natalie Hamilton, said in an email Saturday, that they would\" continue fighting against this unfair and unpopular scheme.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- By blocking a Japanese company\u2019s takeover of U.S. Steel, President Joe Biden said he was protecting good jobs in the American heartland. He may be putting them at risk instead.",
      "In making its nearly $15 billion bid for the storied Pittsburgh-based steelmaker, Nippon Steel had promised to invest $2.7 billion in U.S. Steel\u2019s aging blast furnace operations in Gary, Indiana, and Pennsylvania\u2019s Mon Valley. It also vowed not to reduce production capacity in the United States over the next decade without first getting U.S. government approval.",
      "\u201cThey were going to invest in the Valley,\u2019\u2019 said Jason Zugai, an operating technician and vice president of the United Steelworkers union local at a U.S. Steel plant in the Mon Valley. \u201cThey committed to 10 years of no layoffs. We won\u2019t have those commitments from anybody.\u2019\u2019",
      "Zugai and some other Mon Valley steelworkers supported the Nippon deal in defiance of the union\u2019s national leadership, which pressured the Biden administration to kill it.",
      "Losing the Nippon-U.S. Steel deal \u201cwill be a disaster for Pennsylvania,\u2019\u2019 said Gordon Johnson, who follows U.S. Steel stock on Wall Street as founder of GLJ Research. \u201cI really don\u2019t understand. This is not in the interest of the workers. It\u2019s not in the interest of the shareholders of U.S. Steel.\u2019\u2019",
      "On Friday, Biden said he was stopping the Nippon takeover \u2014 after federal regulators deadlocked on whether to approve it \u2014 because \u201ca strong domestically owned and operated steel industry represents an essential national security priority. ... Without domestic steel production and domestic steel workers, our nation is less strong and less secure.\u2019\u2019",
      "U.S. Steel stock dropped 6.5% on the news Friday.",
      "The decision, announced less than three weeks before the president leaves the White House, reflects a growing bipartisan shift away from free trade and open investment.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump had already come out against the Nippon takeover. \u201cAs President,\u201d he wrote last month on his Truth Social platform, \u201cI will block this deal from happening. Buyer Beware!!!\u201d",
      "In a joint statement, Nippon and U.S. Steel called Biden\u2019s decision \u201ca clear violation of due process and the law\u2019\u2019 and suggested they would sue to salvage their deal: \u201cWe are left with no choice but to take all appropriate action to protect our legal rights.\u2019\u2019",
      "U.S. Steel was founded in 1901 in a merger that involved American business titans J.P. Morgan and Andrew Carnegie and instantly created the largest company in the world. As the U.S. grew to world dominance in the 20th century, U.S. Steel grew with it. In 1943, at the height of the World War II manufacturing boom, U.S. Steel employed 340,000 people.",
      "But foreign competition \u2014 from Japan in the 1970s and \u201880s and later from China \u2014 gradually eroded U.S. Steel\u2019s position and forced it to close plants and lay off workers. The company now employs fewer than 22,000 in an industry dominated by the Chinese.",
      "The U.S. government has sought over the years to protect U.S. Steel and other American steelmakers by imposing taxes on imported steel. During his first term, Trump slapped 25% tariffs on foreign steel, and Biden kept them or converted them into import quotas. Either way, the trade barriers kept the price of American steel artificially high, giving U.S. Steel and others a financial boost.",
      "U.S. Steel is profitable and is sitting on $1.8 billion in cash, though that is down from $2.9 billion at the end of 2023.",
      "United Steelworkers President David McCall declared Friday that U.S. Steel had the financial resources to go it alone. \u201cIt can easily remain a strong and resilient company,\u2019\u2019 he told reporters.",
      "But U.S. Steel has said it needs the cash from Nippon Steel to keep investing in blast furnaces like the ones in Pennsylvania and Indiana.",
      "\u201cWithout the Nippon Steel transaction, U. S. Steel will largely pivot away from its blast furnace facilities, putting thousands of good-paying union jobs at risk, negatively impacting numerous communities across the locations where its facilities exist,\u2019\u2019 U.S. Steel warned in September. The company also threatened to move its headquarters out of Pittsburgh.",
      "On its own, U.S. Steel seems poised to focus on newer electric arc furnaces, such as its Big River plant in Arkansas, which can make high-quality steel products more efficiently and at lower prices compared to blast furnaces, said Josh Spoores, the Pennsylvania-based head of steel Americas analysis for commodity researcher CRU.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if they don\u2019t have the will, but they seem to have seen that it\u2019s a much better investment, a much better rate of return if they look to invest in an electric arc furnace rather than a blast furnace,\u201d Spoores said. He noted that no steelmaker has built a blast furnace in North America for decades.",
      "One possibility is that another company will step in and make a bid for U.S. Steel.",
      "In 2023, arch-rival Cleveland-Cliffs offered to buy U.S. Steel for $7 billion. U.S. Steel turned the offer down and ended up accepting the nearly $15 billion all-cash offer from Nippon Steel, which is the deal that Biden nixed Friday. Perhaps, analysts say, Cleveland-Cliffs will try again.",
      "In a statement, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro warned U.S. Steel management against \u201cthreatening the jobs and livelihoods of the Pennsylvanians who work at the Mon Valley Works and at U.S. Steel HQ and their families.\u2019\u2019",
      "Shapiro also said companies that put in bids to buy U.S. Steel in the future must make the same commitments to \u201ccapital investment and protecting and growing Pennsylvania jobs that Nippon Steel placed on the table.\u2019\u2019",

      "The night started out ripe for celebrating the new year as the party pulsing down Bourbon Street in New Orleans drew revelers from near and far",
      "The night, like countless others Bourbon Street has welcomed over the decades, started out ripe for celebration. With temperatures hovering in the 50s (10-15 Celsius) hours after the arrival of the new year, the open-air party pulsing down New Orleans\u2019 famed nocturnal artery was still hot, drawing revelers from near and far.",
      "After a 3 a.m. pizza, a Pennsylvania man whose family had driven more than 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) to check the city off their bucket list headed back into the music-filled street.",
      "A pair of former Princeton University football teammates joined the crowd so one could show the other what the city\u2019s easygoing energy was all about.",
      "With years of waiting tables in the city\u2019s restaurants behind him, a New Orleans native came down to watch Bourbon Street\u2019s nightly parade of humanity as he had done so many times before.",
      "By the wee hours Wednesday, the crowd strolling beneath the historic street\u2019s wrought-iron balconies, many with go-cups of liquor in hand, was filled with carefree promise. Then an enraged Army veteran behind the wheel of a speeding pickup turned their night of joy into a nightmare.",
      "\u201cMy brother just wanted to go show (his friend) the good spirits and the joy that New Orleans brings, especially on a day like New Year's, all the smiles and the fun,\u201d said Jack Bech, a younger sibling of one of the victims of the deadly truck attack, Tiger Bech. \u201cNobody thought it would ever end the way it did.\u201d",
      "In the days since the rampage killed 14 and injured dozens more, families and friends have questioned the fates that conspired to put loved ones in the wrong place at a singularly horrific moment. The victims, though, were just following legions who have flocked to Bourbon Street over the years with nary a care.",
      "Paralleling the Mississippi River and bisecting the original grid laid out by the city\u2019s French colonizers in 1722, the street originally known as Rue Bourbon has been a nightlife hub since shortly after the Civil War. At first mostly for men, the arrival of dinner clubs in the 1920s drew couples to Bourbon, too. Visitors returned home to recount its drinking, dining and dancing.",
      "But in the decades leading up to last week's attack, the number of night-time businesses on Bourbon swelled substantially. And the street's prime attraction became the visitors themselves.",
      "Since its bars and clubs flung open their doors and windows in the late 1960s and began selling drinks to crowds in the street, \u201cthe spectators have become the spectacle,\u201d said Richard Campanella, author of \u201cBourbon Street: A History\u201d and a professor at the city\u2019s Tulane University.",
      "\u201cEveryone realized that what Bourbon Street meant was not so much the saloons and the clubs along the street, but the street itself and the pedestrian parade,\u201d he said.",
      "To research his 2014 book, Campanella stood in the middle of Bourbon\u2019s busiest stretch, the very area where the New Year\u2019s attack unfolded, and counted late-night partiers. On ordinary weekend nights, over 100 thronged past him each minute. On the night before Mardi Gras, the number more than doubled. Quizzing visitors on four different nights, he found about 70% came from another state and another 10% from outside the U.S.",
      "That rich street life is exactly what drew so many of those killed in the attack, and likely what made Bourbon a target.",
      "\u201cBourbon is like a free party,\u201d said Monisha James, whose 63-year-old uncle, retired waiter and handyman Terrence Kennedy, was killed in the attack. She said he went to a favorite spot on the street frequently, often striking up conversations with strangers.",
      "\u201cThat was what he was doing to enjoy his retirement,\u201d James said.",
      "On New Year\u2019s Eve, Kennedy donned a pair of festive 2025 eyeglasses and set out for Bourbon Street on his bike, his sister Jacqueline Kennedy said. He joined thousands of others.",
      "Before heading out, 25-year-old Matthew Tenedorio, who worked as an audiovisual technician at the New Orleans' Superdome, gathered with his mother and brother for New Year\u2019s Eve.",
      "\u201cWe had dinner and we did fireworks outside, and just laughing and hugging each other and telling each other we loved each other,\u201d his mother Cathy told NBC News. She unsuccessfully tried to convince him not to go into the city.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t think about the risk,\u201d she said. Tenedorio was killed in the attack.",
      "Jeremi Sensky, 51, had driven with his wife, daughter, son-in-law and two friends from their home in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, to New Orleans, which they had long talked about visiting. Feeling a chill after stopping for pizza around 3 a.m., Sensky decided to turn back to their hotel, daughter Heaven Sensky-Kirsch said. That was when attacker Shamsud-Din Jabbar\u2019s rented truck roared down the street.",
      "Others were able to jump out of the way. But Sensky, who used a wheelchair, was hit, sustaining injuries that included two broken legs. He was able to breathe without a ventilator Thursday after enduring 10 hours of surgery.",
      "\u201cWe thought he was dead,\u201d Sensky-Kirsch said. \u201cWe can\u2019t believe he\u2019s alive.\u201d",
      "Tiger Bech and former Princeton teammate Ryan Quigley also were in the crowd. Bech, a 27-year-old native of Lafayette, Louisiana, who found a job in New York after graduation, had come to New Orleans to show the city to Quigley, a first-time visitor from Pennsylvania. Bech was killed in the attack, and Quigley was seriously injured.",
      "Rushed to a nearby hospital, Bech hung on long enough for his mother and father to reach his bedside and link other family members on a video call.",
      "\u201cHis eyes were closed and he was on a machine, but I know he could hear us,\u201d Bech\u2019s brother said in an interview with Sky News. \u201cGod kept his heart beating for a reason, and I truly believe it was so me and my family could tell him goodbye.\u201d",
      "Zion Parsons had arrived from Gulfport, Mississippi, to celebrate a first visit to Bourbon Street with friend Nikyra Dedaux when the truck plowed into them, killing Dedeaux. The 18-year-old had been set to start college in pursuit of a nursing career.",
      "\u201cBodies, bodies all up and down the street, everybody screaming and hollering,\u201d Parsons said. \u201cIt was just insane, like the closest thing to a war zone that I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d",
      "As word of the attack spread, Belal Badawi, of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, tried frantically to reach his two sons, who had driven down to New Orleans to celebrate the new year.",
      "The older one, staying with friends at a hotel, picked up. But the father had no luck reaching 18-year-old Kareem Badawi, a freshman at the University of Alabama who was home for the holiday break. He checked the location of the teen\u2019s phone and saw it was in the heart of the French Quarter.",
      "Racing to New Orleans, the Badawis waited for hours in a hospital before investigators confirmed what they most dreaded: their son was among the dead, on a street devoted to celebrating life.",

      "Ann Telnaes posted a message Friday on the online platform Substack saying that she drew a cartoon showing a group of media executives bowing before Trump while offering him bags of money, including Post owner and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.",
      "Telnaes wrote that the cartoon was intended to criticize \u201cbillionaire tech and media chief executives who have been doing their best to curry favor with incoming President-elect Trump.\" Several executives, Bezos among them, have been spotted at Trump\u2019s Florida club Mar-a-Lago. She accused them of having lucrative government contracts and working to eliminate regulations.",

      "He said he decided to nix the cartoon because the paper had just published a column on the same topic as the cartoon and was set to publish another.",
      "\u201cNot every editorial judgement is a reflection of a malign force. ... The only bias was against repetition,\" Shipley said."

    "summary": "Mike Johnson was reelected as House speaker on a single vote",
    "story": [
      "Mike Johnson was reelected as House speaker on a single vote",
      "WASHINGTON -- This time was supposed to be different.",
      "But while House Speaker Mike Johnson on Friday avoided the dayslong ordeal that his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, endured to become speaker, his relatively swift victory was hardly a unifying moment. The tumult of the day laid bare that Johnson retains only tenuous support from hard-line conservatives who gave him their votes for now, but stand ready to dispatch him just as they did McCarthy if their demands aren't met.",
      "\u201cIs he going to fight?\u201d said Rep. Ralph Norman, a South Carolina Republican who initially opposed Johnson but ultimate changed his vote.",
      "Republicans are relishing the moment as they take unified control of Washington and rally around President-elect Donald Trump. Yet the elements that made for a turbulent House the past two years remain stubbornly in place, except that the stakes are far higher now as Republicans try to deliver on Trump's agenda.",
      "The scale of the conflict to come was apparent as Congress began its new session Friday. House Republicans took shots at each other on TV and argued on the House floor, the freshly elected speaker looked worried, and even after Johnson's victory, some GOP lawmakers openly discussed what might trigger his removal.",
      "For a time, it seemed things might get even worse.",
      "The House chamber seemed to snap back to a familiar scene from the speakership vote two years ago as archconservatives refused to back Johnson, gesticulating while they openly negotiated on the floor. But after an hour of uncertainty and tense negotiations \u2014 as well as Trump calling in from a golf course to make clear he supported Johnson \u2014 two of the three Republicans who at first denied Johnson the speakership changed their votes to give him the majority he needed.",
      "Norman said it was not so much Trump who changed his mind, but the fact that Johnson, as he huddled with the holdouts in the back of the House chamber, vowed that he would indeed \u201cfight for everything going forward.\u201d",
      "Easier said than done.",
      "Johnson has the difficult task of leading a Republican majority that will be even slimmer than it was in the last Congress \u2014 potentially down to a single vote, once a handful of members join Trump's administration.",
      "Last year, the thin majority, as well as near-constant defiance from his right flank, forced Johnson to rely on Democratic support to pass practically any significant legislation.",
      "Johnson tried to turn the page in his first speech after winning the speaker's gavel, arguing that Republicans are now empowered by a \u201cgroundswell of Americans\u201d who want an end to the status quo in Washington.",
      "\u201cSpeaker Johnson contends that in a environment where we have the White House and the Republican Senate, that he\u2019s going to be able to go get the job done,\u201d said Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, who has been outspoken in his criticism of Johnson. \u201cSo we\u2019ll give him a chance to see. But we need to deliver. There\u2019s no room for any excuses now.\u201d",
      "Making matters more difficult, even if Johnson manages to unite his conference in the House, most legislation will still need at least some Democratic support in the Senate, where the chamber's filibuster rules prevent most bills from advancing unless they have support from at least 60 senators. Republicans will have a 53-47 majority in the Senate.",
      "\"He\u2019s got a really, really tough job,\u201d Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said in an interview with NBC's \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d",
      "Republican leadership did ease one threat to Johnson by making it more difficult to oust the speaker through a so-called motion to vacate. Any motion will now need at least nine members from the majority party rather than being triggered by a single lawmaker. Democrats protested that Republicans are shielding the speaker from bipartisan accountability.",
      "Still, within minutes of Johnson gaining the support he needed to take the speakership, the House Freedom Caucus released a letter signed by 11 members demanding that Johnson deliver ambitious policy goals, including enacting permanent border security changes, making aggressive federal spending cuts and banning members of Congress from stock trading.",
      "Caucus members said Johnson now \u201cmust prove he will not fail to enact President Trump's bold agenda.\u201d",
      "At the same time, conservatives are also agitating for guarantees to reduce the federal deficit as well as move power from the speaker's office by allowing rank-and-file members greater control over what's included in legislation. While such promises could prove hard to keep, Johnson committed to working closely with Freedom Caucus members in crafting legislation.",
      "\u201cSpeakers typically don\u2019t last very long,\u201d said Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., a caucus member. \u201cI would say this about Speaker Johnson: As long as this is a member-driven process, I think his speakership will be successful. If it\u2019s not, that's going to be tough.\u201d",
      "Nine conservatives initially withheld support for Johnson during the speakership vote by either staying silent while their names were called or voting for someone else. It was taken by many as a not-so-subtle message that the motion to vacate is still at hand, even with the rules change.",
      "The warning was even raised to Johnson during a huddle over the speaker vote, Norman said.",
      "Norman said Johnson responded: \u201cLook, if I don\u2019t perform like I say I\u2019m going to perform and push the things that you\u2019re saying, put me out. I never thought I would have this job anyway.'\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The truck attack in New Orleans by an Army veteran inspired by the Islamic State group unfolded amid months of warnings by officials about a resurgent terrorism threat",
      "WASHINGTON -- After Hamas launched the deadly assault on Israel that triggered retaliatory airstrikes on Gaza, FBI Director Christopher Wray said he feared the Middle East violence could embolden individuals or groups to carry out attacks inside the United States.",
      "Months later, after extremists with the Islamic State group's Afghanistan affiliate killed more than 140 people at a Russian concert hall, Wray sounded the alarm about the potential for a similar coordinated attack closer to home.",
      "Following these months of warnings about a resurgent terrorism threat, an Army veteran inspired by IS slammed a pickup truck into crowds celebrating New Year's in New Orleans. But the culprit did not coordinate with international operatives, nor was he part of any broader plot. Instead, he embodied a longstanding concern that snapped into focus in the years after the Sept. 11 attacks and never evaporated: the threat from homegrown extremists who radicalize on their own before committing mass violence in the name of foreign groups.",
      "\u201cI have never seen the threat landscape this worrying, not just from a counterterrorism perspective but from state-sponsored threats,\u201d said Christopher Costa, a former career intelligence officer and senior director for counterterrorism at the White House National Security Council in the first Trump administration.",
      "He said the \u201cgrab-bag of grievances\u201d that may have driven 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar to act \u2014 he had multiple divorces and financial pressures and noted in a video posted before the rampage that he thought of killing his family \u2014 was consistent with the profile of other attackers. And it coincided with a climate of global instability that has given extra incentive to troubled people prone to violence, from the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks that launched the war in Gaza to the dramatic overthrow last month of Syrian President Bashar Assad.",
      "\u201cYou pick the grievance, and then you\u2019ll find the ideology to act on it,\u201d Costa said. \u201cNow it includes Oct. 7, it includes IS \u2014 and why IS is so important right now is because it is resurging as a result of what IS could perceive as a victory in Syria.\u201d",
      "The New Orleans attack that killed 14 is thought to be the deadliest IS-inspired assault on U.S. soil since a 2016 massacre of 49 people inside a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, by a gunman who professed allegiance to the group's then-leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. That shooting occurred at a time when the FBI was racing to disrupt a surge in plots by \u201clone wolves\" who were drawn to act by Islamic State propaganda or even to travel to the group's so-called caliphate in Syria and Iraq.",
      "The threat never abated, as evidenced by the FBI's October arrest of an Afghan man in Oklahoma who authorities say was inspired by the Islamic State group to plot an Election Day attack.",
      "But more brazen and coordinated efforts originating from overseas have drawn greater public attention recently, such as Iranian assassination plots targeting public officials, including President-elect Donald Trump. Add to the mix the turmoil in the Middle East, which has prompted demonstrations in the U.S., the 2021 collapse of the Afghan government that gave rise to Taliban leadership, and concerns about those with Islamic State ties entering the U.S. through the southern border.",
      "The swirl of concerns led Wray to tell The Associated Press in August that he was \u201chard-pressed to think of a time in my career where so many different kinds of threats are all elevated at once.\u201d",
      "That such a deadly assault in New Orleans was carried out by a lone actor without any direction from overseas underscores the volatile and unpredictable nature of the terrorism threat as well as the challenges in stopping violence from such individuals.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very, very difficult law enforcement challenge, much more difficult than dealing with someone who may have had active communications with overseas actors, for example, or having a distinct online profile in which they were consuming and participating in extremist activity in the online space,\" said Nicholas Rasmussen, the counterterrorism coordinator for the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t have that,\u201d he added, \"then you are very much reliant on that bystander phenomenon.\u201d",
      "There's no indication that Jabbar, who was fatally shot in a firefight with police, was ever on law enforcement's radar prior to the attack. FBI investigators, however, have turned up significant signs of planning, including suspected bomb-making materials in his short-term New Orleans rental property and his Houston home, the FBI said in a statement Friday.",
      "Though officials say he wasn't aided by conspirators, Jabbar's method \u2014 ramming a truck into bystanders \u2014 is a favored option for Islamic State followers, and a pro-IS media unit on Dec. 30 encouraged attacks at New Year's Eve celebrations in the U.S. and other countries, according to an intelligence bulletin from the FBI and DHS seen by The Associated Press.",
      "The terrorism threat is set to be inherited in just over two weeks by Trump and an FBI that's bracing for a dramatic leadership change with the nomination of Kash Patel. Patel has long been skeptical of the FBI's use of its national security powers and has spoken of breaking off the bureau's \u201cintel shops\u201d from the rest of its crime-fighting activities. It's unclear how the New Orleans attack might affect any plans he has if confirmed to the post.",
      "There's no question that the turmoil in Syria \u2014 and what it could mean for the Islamic State group's ability to reconstitute and inspire supporters in the West \u2014 is a major national security wild card.",
      "Assad\u2019s ouster and the arrival of the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, as Syria\u2019s main power broker have been met with degrees of relief but also alarm. Apart from HTS\u2019 past affiliation with al-Qaida, the collapse of Assad\u2019s military has raised fears of a power vacuum that many believe IS will seek to exploit.",
      "Assad\u2019s departure also has opened a window for Turkey to expand operations against Kurdish fighters in northern Syria that it believes are terrorists. The Syrian Defense Forces have been key U.S. allies in the fight against IS and operate detention camps for thousands of captured foreign fighters.",
      "U.S. and European officials are concerned that intensified Turkish attacks against the SDF may contribute to a potential IS resurgence.",
      "None of that conflict made a New Year's Day attack on U.S. soil by someone claiming inspiration from IS easily predictable, especially since such violence is far rarer than in the Middle East or Europe, said Natana DeLong-Bas, a professor of theology and Islamic Studies at Boston College.",
      "Even so, she noted, \u201cany idiot\u201d can rent a vehicle.",

      "The judge in President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s hush money case has made a dramatic decision that could nevertheless bring the case to a muted end",
      "NEW YORK -- Faced with the never-before-seen dilemma of how, when or even whether to sentence a former and future U.S. president, the judge in President-elect Donald Trump 's hush money case made a dramatic decision that could nevertheless bring the case to a muted end.",
      "In a ruling Friday, Manhattan Judge Juan M. Merchan scheduled the sentencing for 10 days before Trump's inauguration \u2014 but the judge indicated that he's leaning toward a sentence that would amount to just closing the case without any real punishment. He said Trump could attend the Jan. 10 proceeding remotely because of his transition duties.",
      "Still, that would leave Trump headed back to the White House with a felony conviction.",
      "Will it come to that? Trump wants the conviction thrown out and the case dismissed, and communications director Steven Cheung said the president-elect will \u201ckeep fighting.\u201d But it's tough to predict just what will unfold in this unprecedented, unpredictable case. Here are some key questions and what we know about the answers:",
      "Trump was convicted in May of 34 felony counts of falsifying his business' records. They pertained to a $130,000 payment, made through his former personal lawyer in 2016, to keep porn actor Stormy Daniels from publicizing her story of having had sex with Trump a decade earlier. He denies her claim and says he's done nothing wrong.",
      "Trump's sentencing was initially set for July 11. But at his lawyers' request, the proceeding was postponed twice, eventually landing on a date in late November, after the presidential election. Then Trump won, and Merchan put everything on hold to consider what to do.",
      "Merchan denied Trump's request to toss out the conviction and the entire case. The judge ordered Trump to appear \u2014 virtually or in person, as he chooses \u2014 for sentencing at 9:30 a.m. Jan. 10.",
      "That won't be final until the judge pronounces it, and he noted that by law, he has to give prosecutors and Trump an opportunity to weigh in. The charges carry potential penalties ranging from a fine or probation to up to four years in prison.",
      "But the judge wrote that \u201cthe most viable option\" appears to be what's called an unconditional discharge. It wraps up a case without imprisonment, a fine or probation. But an unconditional discharge leaves a defendant's conviction on the books.",
      "And by law, every person convicted of a felony in New York must provide a DNA sample for the state\u2019s crime databank, even in cases of an unconditional discharge.",
      "It's murky. Appealing a conviction or sentence is one thing, but the ins and outs of challenging other types of decisions during a case are complicated.",
      "Former Manhattan Judge Diane Kiesel said that under New York law, Friday's ruling can't be appealed, but that \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not going to try.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s lawyers have been trying to get a federal court to take control of the case. Prosecutors are due to file a response with the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals by Jan. 13, three days after Trump now is to be sentenced.",
      "The defense also has suggested it would seek the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s intervention if Merchan didn\u2019t throw out the case. In a Nov. 25 letter to the judge, Trump\u2019s attorneys contended that the U.S. Constitution permits an appeal to the high court because the defense is making arguments about presidential immunity.",
      "Much of their argument concerns the Supreme Court's July ruling on that topic, which afforded considerable legal protections to presidents. Trump's attorneys might try to convince the Supreme Court that it needs to follow up by getting involved now in the hush money case.",
      "A Trump spokesperson said no decision had been made on whether to challenge Merchan\u2019s ruling.",
      "They declined to comment on Merchan's ruling. They had previously encouraged him to uphold the verdict and offered options such as delaying sentencing until Trump left office, promising no jail time, or closing the case by noting he was convicted but never sentenced because of presidential immunity. Merchan said he found those ideas untenable.",
      "Yes. But by law, he can't do that until he's sentenced.",
      "Not in this case. Presidential pardons apply only to federal crimes. Trump was convicted in a New York state court."

      "The biggest drop below normal is likely to be centered over the Ohio Valley, but significant and unusual cold will extend south to the Gulf Coast, said Danny Barandiaran, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service\u2019s Climate Prediction Center.",
      "A hard freeze is even expected in Florida, he added.",

      "The brutal weather may be triggered in part by a fast-warming Arctic, a reminder that climate change gooses weather extremes, said Judah Cohen, seasonal forecast director at the private firm Atmospheric and Environmental Research.",
      "The polar vortex \u2014 ultra-cold air spinning like a top \u2014 usually stays above the North Pole, but sometimes stretches down to the U.S., Europe or Asia, causing intense doses of cold.",
      "Cohen and colleagues have published several studies showing an increase in the polar vortex stretching or wandering. Cohen and others lpublished a study last month attributing the cold outbreaks partly to changes from an Arctic that is warming four times faster than the rest of the globe."

      "Here is what to know about the initial ceremonies and what happens next:",
      "The proceedings, streamed on apnews.com and the Associated Press YouTube channel, are schelued to begin at 10:15 a.m. EST Saturday with the Carter family arriving at Phoebe Sumter Medical Center in Americus.",
      "Former Secret Service agents who protected Carter will serve as pallbearers, walking alongside the hearse as it exits the campus on its way to Plains.",
      "James Earl Carter Jr. lived more than 80 of his 100 years in and around the town, which still has fewer than 700 people, not much more than when he was born on Oct. 1, 1924. Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton also grew up in rural settings, but Carter stands out for returning and remaining in his birthplace for his long post-presidency.",
      "The motorcade will move through downtown Plains, which spans just a few blocks, passing near the girlhood home of first lady Rosalynn Smith Carter, who died in November 2023 at the age of 96, and near where the couple operated the family peanut warehouses. The route also includes the old train depot that served as Jimmy Carter's 1976 presidential campaign headquarters and the gas station once run by Carter's younger brother Billy.",
      "The motorcade will then pass by the Methodist church where the Carters married in 1946, and the home where they lived and died. The former president will be buried there alongside Rosalynn.",
      "The Carters built the one-story house, now surrounded by Secret Service fencing, before his first state Senate campaign in 1962 and lived out their lives there with the exception of four years in the Governor's Mansion and four more in the White House.",
      "The military-run schedule calls for a 10:50 a.m. stop in front of Carter's family farm and boyhood home in Archery, outside Plains, after passing the cemetery where the former president's parents, James Earl Carter Sr. and Lillian Carter, are buried.",
      "The farm now is part of the Jimmy Carter National Historical Park. The National Park Service will ring the old farm bell 39 times to honor the 39th president.",
      "Carter was the first president born in a hospital. But the home had no electricity or running water when he was born, and he worked his father's land during the Great Depression. Still, the Carters had relative privilege and status. Earl employed Black tenant farming families. The elder Carter also owned a store in Plains and was a local civic and political leader. Lillian was a nurse and she delivered Rosalynn. The property still includes a tennis court Earl had built for the family.",
      "It was Earl's death in 1953 that set Jimmy on course toward the Oval Office. The younger Carters had left Plains after he graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy. But Jimmy abandoned a promising career as a submarine officer and early participant in the Pentagon's nuclear program to take over the family's peanut business after his father's death. Within a decade, he was elected to the Georgia state Senate.",
      "From Archery, the motorcade will head north to Atlanta and will stop at 3 p.m. outside at the Georgia Capitol, where he served as a state senator from 1963 to 1967 and governor from 1971 to 1975. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens will lead a moment of silence. While former governors are honored with state-run funerals, presidents \u2014 even if they served as governors \u2014 are memorialized with national rites run by the federal government.",
      "The motorcade then is scheduled to arrive at the Carter Presidential Center at 3:45 p.m., with a private service at 4 p.m. The campus includes Carter\u2019s presidential library and The Carter Center, established by the former president and first lady in 1982.",
      "From 7 p.m. Saturday through 6 a.m. Monday, Carter will lie in repose for the public to pay respects around the clock.",
      "The ceremony is expected to include some of The Carter Center's global staff of 3,000, whose work concentrating on international diplomacy and mediation, election monitoring and fighting disease in the developing world continues to set a standard for what former presidents can accomplish.",
      "Jimmy Carter, who delivered its annual reports until 2019, won the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize in part for this post-presidential work. His grandson Jason Carter now chairs the board.",
      "Carter's remains will travel next to Washington, where he will lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda until his funeral at 10 a.m. Thursday at the Washington National Cathedral. All the living presidents have been invited, and Joe Biden, a Carter ally, will deliver a eulogy.",

      "It never got old",
      "PLAINS, Ga. -- It never got old.",
      "No matter how many times one crammed into the modest sanctuary at Maranatha Baptist Church, there was always some wisdom to be gleaned from the measured, Bible-inspired words of Jimmy Carter.",
      "This was another side of the 39th president, a down-to-earth man of steadfast faith who somehow found time to teach Sunday school classes when he wasn\u2019t building homes for the needy, or advocating for fair elections, or helping eradicate awful diseases.",
      "For young and old, straight and gay, believers and nonbelievers, Black and white and brown, Maranatha was a far-off-the-beaten path destination in southwest Georgia where Carter, well into his 90s, stayed connected with his fellow citizens of the world.",
      "Anyone willing to make the trek to his hometown of Plains, with its one blinking caution light and residents numbering in the hundreds, was rewarded with access to a white-haired man who once occupied the highest office in the land.",
      "Carter taught his Sunday school class roughly twice a month to accommodate crowds that sometimes swelled to more than 500. (On the other Sundays, no more than a couple dozen regulars and a handful of visitors usually attended services).",
      "Here, the former commander-in-chief and the onetime first lady, his wife of more than seven decades, were simply Mr. Jimmy and Ms. Rosalynn. And when it came to worshipping with them, all were welcome.",
      "Before the former president entered the sanctuary, with a bomb-sniffing dog outside and Secret Service agents scattered around, a strict set of rules would be laid out by Ms. Jan \u2014 Jan Williams, a longtime church member and friend of the Carters. She would have made quite a drill sergeant.",
      "It felt like a good-cop, bad-cop routine. Ms. Jan barking out rules you knew had come straight from Mr. Jimmy, who studied nuclear physics and approached all things with an engineer\u2019s orderly mind.",
      "Most important for those wanting a photo with the Carters \u2014 and nearly everyone did \u2014 you had to stay for the main 11 a.m. church service. Picture-taking began around noon.",
      "If you left the church grounds before that, there was no coming back. If you stayed, you followed rules. No autographs. No handshakes. No attempts at conversation beyond a brief \u201cgood morning\u201d or \u201cthank you.\u201d",
      "Carter, consistently in sports jacket, slacks and bolo tie, would start his lesson by moving around the sanctuary, asking with a straight face if there were any visitors \u2014 that always got a laugh \u2014 and where they were from. In my many trips to Maranatha, I\u2019m sure I heard all 50 states, not to mention an array of far-flung countries.",
      "If anyone answered Washington, D.C., the answer was predictable. \u201cI used to live there,\u201d the one-term president would say, breaking into that toothy grin.",
      "Carter\u2019s Bible lessons focused on central themes: God gives life, loves unconditionally and provides the freedom to live a completely successful life. But the lesson usually began with an anecdote about what he\u2019d been up to or his perspective on world affairs.",
      "Carter could talk about building homes with Habitat for Humanity or bemoan U.S. conflicts since World War II. He could talk about his work with The Elders, a group of former world leaders, or a trip out West to go trout fishing with Ted Turner. He could talk about The Carter Center\u2019s successes in eliminating the guinea worm, or his long friendships with Willie Nelson and Bob Dylan.",
      "\u201cWillie Nelson is an old friend. He used to come visit me in the White House,\u201d Carter related once, touching ever so gently on Nelson\u2019s affection for weed.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what Willie and my children did after I went to bed. I\u2019ve heard rumors,\u201d the former president said, with a sly grin and a wink that suggested he believed every word.",
      "My favorite: Carter telling of his latest book project and how he had long used encyclopedias for research.",
      "Carter decided the collection was taking up too much space, so he boxed it up and headed out to local schools and libraries, figuring someone would eagerly take a donation from an ex-president. Instead, he got a standard refrain: Sorry, no one uses encyclopedias anymore.",
      "I recall the punchline. \u201cHow do I look up things now?\u201d asked the man born five years after World War I ended. Pause. Then: \u201dGoogle.\u201d",
      "During most of my visits to Maranatha, Carter spoke for 45 minutes without sitting down. His mind remained sharp, with only an occasional glance at the notes tucked inside his Bible, but his body became more and more feeble as he moved deeper into his 90s. He talked openly about the ravages of aging.",
      "He resisted church members\u2019 pleadings to take a seat while teaching. I was there the first time he tried it, in August 2018.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m uncomfortable sitting down,\u201d he said, \u201dbut I guess I\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d",
      "Not that time. Carter sat for less than 10 minutes before rising. He stood at the table for the rest of class.",
      "Returning the following year, Carter had relented to using a white, remote-controlled chair. After climbing aboard \u2014 voil\u00e0 \u2014 a flick of a switch would slowly lift him above the lectern, visible even to those sitting in the back.",
      "If there wasn\u2019t enough room in the sanctuary, rows of folding chairs were set up in the fellowship hall and a handful of tiny classrooms. Carter\u2019s lesson would be shown on TVs linked to a feed from the main room.",
      "A letdown for visitors? Perhaps. But relegation to a back room had its benefits.",
      "Carter, who usually arrived about 15 minutes before the start of his 10 a.m. lesson, would swing by these rooms before heading to the sanctuary. He would even take a few questions, which didn\u2019t happen in front of the big crowd.",
      "After a 2018 profile by The Washington Post told of the Carters having regular Saturday night dinners at friend Jill Stuckey\u2019s house, which included one glass each of \u201cbargain-brand Chardonnay,\u201d I asked Carter how many glasses of wine he\u2019d had the night before.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll say one,\u201d Carter replied with a sly grin. Stuckey, standing behind him, shook her head and held up two fingers.",
      "No matter where you sat \u2014 main sanctuary or back room \u2014 everyone got their picture taken with Mr. Jimmy and Ms. Rosalynn. For many, this seemed the biggest reward.",
      "When we first started attending, those pictures were taken under a tree just outside the church. After being diagnosed with cancer in 2015, Carter and his wife would pose with visitors inside the sanctuary. Carter liked to joke about what a burden it was to sit for all those pictures, which surely numbered in the hundreds of thousands.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll be delighted to have photographs made with all of you,\u201d he quipped after one of his final lessons. \u201cActually, since I\u2019m in church, I better say I\u2019ll be willing to have photographs made with all of you.\u201d",
      "For my family, those pictures show a son growing from boy to man with Mr. Jimmy and Ms. Rosalynn filling out the frames. What a treasure they are.",
      "Turnout for Carter\u2019s Sunday school lessons dipped during the Great Recession. But the crowds returned after his cancer announcement, with some folks lining up outside the church the night before.",
      "Carter declared himself cancer-free, but other health challenges began to catch up with him. After an October 2019 fall at his home left him with a slightly fractured pelvis, the church announced Carter would not teach his next class on Nov. 3, a lesson we had planned to attend. Disappointed, we canceled our hotel reservation.",
      "But Mr. Jimmy wasn\u2019t done just yet.",
      "The church had canceled without checking with him. He made it clear that he was NOT cancelling. We quickly rebooked. Carter\u2019s lesson that day, based on the Book of Job, was especially poignant in retrospect.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to start by asking you a very profound question,\u201d he said. \u201cHow many of you believe in life after death?\u201d",
      "Carter conceded to having doubts for most of his life, right up to being stricken by cancer, which finally erased any skepticism. When the end on this world came, he would be ready.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have anything to dread after death,\u201d Carter said with a reassuring smile.",
      "At the end of his lesson, he challenged everyone to do one good deed for a stranger. \u201cI\u2019m going to hold you to it,\u201d Carter promised.",
      "He never got the chance.",
      "His health continued to decline, sidelining him through the Christmas season. Then, the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the world in 2020.",
      "By that summer, it was clear that Mr. Jimmy\u2019s treasured role as spreader of the gospel, which he began at 18 and resumed after his presidency, was over.",
      "___",
      "Paul Newberry, an Atlanta-based national sports writer and columnist for The Associated Press, traveled to Plains, Georgia, with his family and friends about 20 times to attend Carter\u2019s Sunday school classes. He was there for Carter\u2019s final lesson."

      "The new Los Angeles County district attorney has met with the Menendez brothers\u2019 family as he continues to review the brothers' bid for freedom 35 years after they were convicted of killing their parents",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The new Los Angeles County District Attorney met with the Menendez brothers' family as he continues to review their bid for freedom 35 years after they were convicted of killing their parents.",
      "Nathan Hochman, who took office in December, said Friday that he had a \u201cproductive session\u201d with the family members, who shared their thoughts with him on whether the brothers should be released. The meeting lasted about three hours.",
      "Brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez were found guilty of murdering Jose and Kitty Menendez in 1989 and sentenced to life in prison without parole. Now in their 50s, they began their bid for freedom in recent years after new evidence of their father\u2019s sexual abuse emerged in their case. Their lawyers filed a habeas corpus petition \u2014 a request for a court to examine whether someone is being lawfully detained \u2014 in May 2023, asking a judge to consider the evidence.",
      "The brothers have the support of most of their extended family, who have said they deserve to be free after decades behind bars. Several family members have said that in today\u2019s world \u2014 which is more aware of the impact of sexual abuse \u2014 the brothers would not have been convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life.",
      "In October 2024, then-District Attorney George Gascon recommended the brothers be resentenced to 50 years to life, which would make them immediately eligible for parole. Hochman, who was running against Gascon, called it a \u201cdesperate political move.\u201d",
      "\u201cBy releasing it now, Gascon has cast a cloud over the fairness and impartiality of his decision,\u201d he said at the time.",
      "A judge delayed the brothers' resentencing hearing, originally set for early December, to the end of January. Superior Court Judge Michael Jesic said he needed time to review extensive evidence and give Hochman time to weigh in on the case.",
      "Hochman said Friday he was still reviewing thousands of pages of prison records to \u201canalyze the rehabilitation aspect of resentencing.\u201d Evidence of rehabilitation could include not engaging in illegal activity while in prison, starting organizations that helped other prisoners, and using that time to improve oneself, he said.",
      "At the brothers' original trials, their defense attorneys argued that they had been sexually abused by their father. Prosecutors denied that and accused them of killing their parents for money. In the years that followed, they repeatedly appealed their convictions without success.",
      "The brothers are being held at the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego.",

      "Nonfatal shootings, assaults, carjackings and other violent crime also continue to drop across the city.",
      "\u201cWe have numbers that are nothing short of remarkable,\" Duggan said. \"I was the (Wayne County) prosecutor in 2002 and I remember the Detroit police celebrating that we got under 400 homicides for the first time and they said, \u2018We never thought we\u2019d see that number.' And a few years back I was the mayor and we got under 300 homicides.\u201d",
      "Overall violent crime in the United States declined by an estimated 3% in 2023 from the year before, according to an FBI report released in September. Nationally, murders and non-negligent manslaughter dropped nearly 12%.",

      "Decreases have been across the board. Carjackings dipped from 167 in 2023 to 142 last year. Sexual assaults also were down and 184 fewer robberies were reported last year compared to 2023. Burglaries, larcenies and motor vehicle theft also dropped.",
      "Duggan credited the city's partnerships with other local and state law enforcement and federal agencies.",
      "He also credited programs like ShotStoppers which provides federal funds to groups in Detroit working to cut down the numbers of homicides and shootings. Reductions of 83%, 73% and 61% in some of the city\u2019s most violent areas were reported last month.",
      "ShotStoppers kicked off in 2023 and empowers activists and residents to use their own strategies to prevent violence. Those strategies include teaching young people to think critically, improving training opportunities for adults, drug prevention and blight removal.",
      "Detroit also has been hiring more police officers, putting 340 more on city streets over the past two years."

Supermarket-branded tins may be cheaper, so keep a close eye on prices. Food banks can also help if you are short of money.",
      "Take care not to overfill the kettle by measuring out what is needed to keep costs down. Batch cooking can also help. Don't forget fruit and vegetables - the latter can be cooked with a steamer on one hob, rather than using different ones.",

      "US President Joe Biden has blocked the takeover of US Steel by a bigger Japanese firm, delivering on a political promise despite fears the move could hurt Washington's relations with Tokyo and scare off other foreign investors.",
      "Biden cited threats to national security in rejecting the Nippon Steel purchase, saying US ownership was important to keeping the US steel industry and its supply chains strong.",
      "His intervention follows pressure from the United Steelworkers union, which had opposed a transaction that was a sensitive political issue in the 2024 US presidential campaign.",
      "The Japanese government has called Biden's decision \"incomprehensible\".",
      "Nippon Steel and US Steel said Biden's decision showed the review of the deal had been \"corrupted\" for political gain.",
      "The two companies, which had previously threatened to sue the government if the deal did not happen, on Friday said they would take \"appropriate action to protect their legal rights\".",
      "\"We believe that President Biden has sacrificed the future of American steelworkers for his own political agenda,\" the companies said in a statement, adding that the move sent \"a chilling message to any company based in a US allied country contemplating significant investment in the United States\".",
      "Japanese officials also said they were disappointed by the decision.",
      "\"There are strong concerns from the economic circles of both Japan and the US, and especially from Japanese industry regarding future investments between Japan and the US, and the Japanese government has no choice but to take this matter seriously,\" Japanese industry and trade minister Yoji Muto said in a statement to Reuters.",
      "Biden's decision comes a year after Nippon Steel first announced the $14.9bn (\u00a312bn) deal to buy its smaller Pennsylvania-based rival.",
      "It raises significant questions about the path forward for the company, a 124-year-old name that was once a symbol of American industrial might but is now much diminished.",
      "It spent months looking for a buyer before announcing the tie-up with Nippon Steel, the world's fourth largest steelmaker, in December 2023.",
      "US Steel has warned that it might have to close factories without the investment that would come with a new owner, concerns that had been echoed by some workers and local politicians.",
      "The two companies had pledged not to cut jobs and made other concessions in an effort to win support for the deal. Just this week, they offered to fund a workforce training centre - and reportedly give the government the right to veto potential production cuts.",
      "But the arguments failed to convince Biden, who had come out in opposition to the deal early last year, as election season heated up and with the key swing state of Pennsylvania poised to play a key role.",
      "The transaction was also criticised by President-elect Donald Trump and the incoming vice-president, JD Vance, whose appeals to union workers formed a big  part of their campaign message.",
      "The US government panel charged with reviewing the deal for national security risks failed to reach a consensus by late December, leaving the decision to Biden, who was required to act within a 15-day deadline.",
      "In his announcement on Friday he said foreign ownership presented a risk and ordered the companies to abandon the deal within 30 days.",
      "\"A strong domestically owned and operated steel industry represents an essential national security priority and is critical for resilient supply chains,\" he said.",
      "\"That is because steel powers our country: our infrastructure, our auto industry, and our defence industrial base. Without domestic steel production and domestic steel workers, our nation is less strong and less secure.\"",
      "The United Steelworkers union called the decision the \"right move for our members and our national security\", saying its opposition had been driven by concerns about the long-term viability of its industry.",
      "\"We're grateful for President Biden's willingness to take bold action to maintain a strong domestic steel industry and for his lifelong commitment to American workers,\" President David McCall said.",
      "Prof Stephen Nagy, of the Department of Politics International Studies at the International Christian University in Tokyo, called Biden's decision \"political\", noting that the administration from its start promised a foreign policy \"for the middle class\".",
      "\"This was a direct response and continuation of the Trump MAGA agenda of Making America Great Again,\" he said. \"The Biden administration couldn't appear weak on foreign businesses, whether it's an ally or adversary.\"",
      "White House spokesperson John Kirby dismissed suggestions the move could damage American relationships with allies, saying Biden had made clear the decision was not \"about Japan\",",
      "\"This is about US steel-making and keeping one of the largest steel producers in the United States an American-owned company,\" he said at a press conference.",
      "Shares in US Steel fell more than 5% on Friday.",
      "But analysts said the move might not mark the end of the deal. Biden's order says the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States can extend the 30-day deadline to scrap the transaction.",
      "Prof Nagy said he thought the companies could decide to try again under Trump, potentially offering different terms that would allow the new president to claim he had negotiated a better deal.",
      "Political analyst Terry Haines of Pangaea Policy also said Trump, despite his criticism of the deal, might have reason to revisit the decision.",
      "\"One of the things that's difficult about this decision is that Japan is a very close US ally,\" he said. \"The government's got frankly a big evidentiary burden in order to justify what they're doing today - and it hurts bilateral relations with Japan, something Trump will want to avoid.\""

    "published": "Sat, 04 Jan 2025 15:34:20 GMT",
    "summary": "Delays and cancellations related to British weather may become more common.",
    "story": [
      "Passengers at British airports have faced travel chaos on multiple occasions over the last few weeks, from heavy winds to fog.",
      "Now, the Met Office has issued an amber warning for snow and ice in the Midlands, north of England and Wales, which says that delays and cancellations to air travel are \"expected\".",
      "It can seem a mystery to many frustrated flyers that a brief spell of bad weather can upend schedules, especially since British weather isn't exactly famed for being the best.",
      "So why, with all the technological advancements of planes and airports in recent years, do flights get affected so badly?",
      "How efficiency can quickly turn to chaos",
      "While planes are designed to deal with the likes of snow and ice, fog and high winds, air traffic control often imposes strict safety limits in these situations.",
      "As a result, \"airports go into a kind of slow motion\" with the spacing between arriving and departing aircraft increased, says travel expert Simon Calder.",
      "If the conditions \"require air-traffic controllers to increase the spacing between aircraft by 50%, capacity is immediately reduced by one third \u2013 and cancellations begin,\" he adds.",
      "There's little slack in the system, as when things are running smoothly, schedules at London Heathrow - Europe's busiest airport - are based on landing aircraft as close as 80 seconds apart. And London Gatwick, the UK's second busiest airport, can facilitate a take-off or landing every 65 seconds.",
      "The spacing between arriving and departing aircraft was increased at London Gatwick last weekend during the fog, which Mr Calder estimates led to about 75,000 passengers being affected.",
      "Among them were James and Madison King, whose flight from Stockholm to London took a lengthy diversion because of the fog-related spacing limits.",
      "They were within touching distance of home when the pilot announced they did not have enough fuel for a 50-minute holding pattern at Gatwick, so the plane diverted to Dublin to refuel. Flight crew shift limits then meant all the passengers had to fly back to where they started in the Swedish capital.",
      "James says he still hasn't been reimbursed for the \u00a3200 he spent on a hotel and dinner during this impromptu additional overnight stay in Stockholm.",
      "Heathrow also saw delays and cancellations during high winds before Christmas.",
      "Despite some airports trialling artificial intelligence to help planes land in low visibility, controllers in on-the-ground towers still need to clearly see an aircraft arriving before issuing a landing clearance, aviation expert Scott Bateman MBE wrote on X.",
      "He says the majority of modern aircraft can automatically land in the worst fog, but that in practice visibility limits are imposed so pilots can see sufficiently to taxi off the runway.",
      "Elif Arjin Celik's flight from London Gatwick to Istanbul was delayed for hours because of poor visibility in the fog on 28 December 2024.",
      "She saw thousands of people waiting in the terminal with nowhere to sit, and says it was \"grim\" having to wait 20 minutes to use the toilet because of the \"extreme overcrowding\".",
      "With upcoming warnings of snow, Mr Calder advises passengers to brace for more disruption to their flights because of spacing limits and runway closures.",
      "\"The UK has seen some shocking snow closures, where big airports have simply not been able to cope,\" he says, citing an incident in 2010 where hundreds of thousands of passengers saw cancellations at Heathrow because of snow.",
      "Snow also caused Manchester Airport to close both its runways in December 2022 and again in January 2023, with flights diverted as far away as Dublin and Paris.",
      "Although the extreme cost of disruption on this scale has led to British airports investing more in hardware and training to clear snow quicker, don't expect us to cope like airports in places such as Iceland and Greenland.",
      "Mr Calder says we might never be as good as other countries at keeping an efficient schedule in unusual weather.",
      "\"Historically the UK has had a benign climate,\" he says. \"Spending millions preparing for an unlikely event has been hard to justify.\"",
      "Disruption could grow",
      "There's not great news on the horizon because in the future, we can expect more disruption from weather related to climate change, says Dr Ella Gilbert, a climate expert from the British Antarctic Survey.",
      "\"Aviation tends to be most impacted by extreme precipitation and stormy weather that makes flying unsafe - two weather types that are enhanced by higher temperatures,\" she says.",
      "She adds that climate heating increases the frequency and intensity of rain and snowfall events, making storms \"stronger and more frequent\" and increasing the frequency of aircraft turbulence.",
      "Nats, the national air traffic service, is allowed to take action to reduce the amount of planes in the sky and space them apart more during adverse weather under the Transport Act 2000.",
      "Given this is part of Nats' obligation to prioritise safety over all other factors, it doesn't have to compensate airlines for these restrictions - which in turn means airlines don't need to compensate passengers for the resulting delays either.",
      "The organisation told the BBC that it recognises there's a tough balancing act.",
      "\"Flow regulations are only ever employed when absolutely necessary and have to be expertly timed,\" a Nats spokesperson said.",
      "\"Unexpected additional or delayed air traffic can increase the pressure on controllers, particularly when the weather clears.",
      "\"If restrictions are lifted too early, they can risk an overpopulated airspace, while on the flip side, restrictions remaining in place longer than they need to can lead to unnecessary delays, which no one wants.\"",
      "This is brought into sharp focus during storms, Nats explained.",
      "\"Fundamentally, pilots don't want to fly through storms,\" it told the BBC.",
      "\"Although aircraft are robust, storms can still affect aircraft systems and excessive winds within unstable storm clouds make it much more difficult for aircraft to maintain their levels. It also increases turbulence, which negatively impacts passenger comfort.\"",
      "This leads to planes being in unexpected parts of the sky at different times, and all these new routes needing to be recalibrated to avoid any collisions.",
      "Nats says it does have measures to mitigate disruption, including specialist Met Office weather equipment which can help foresee the need for safety limits to be imposed, while pilots also have more tech on board to help them fly around bad weather patches and inform air traffic controllers of potential issues.",
      "What are your rights if a flight is cancelled due to poor weather?",

      "In September Volvo abandoned its target to only produce EVs by 2030, arguing that \"customers and markets are moving at different speeds\". Meanwhile China, the market leader in electric batteries, has been able to undercut Northvolt's prices.",
      "Missing production targets (a key factor in BMW pulling out of a \u20ac2bn deal in June), expanding too quickly, and the company's leadership have also been widely cited as factors fuelling the crisis.",
      "\"To build batteries is a very complex process. It takes a lot of capital, it takes time, and they obviously just didn't have the right personnel running the company,\" argues Andreas Cervenka, a business author and economics commentator for Swedish daily Aftonbladet.",
      "At Ume\u00e5 university, Madeleine Eriksson, a geographer researching the impact of so-called \"green industries\" says Northvolt presented a \"save the world mentality\" that impressed investors, media and local politicians.",

      "\"Sweden is still punching above its weight in this sector. And I think we could expect it to continue to do so moving forward as well,\" predicts Anderson.",
      "There are growing calls for increased state support to help Sweden maintain its position. The Swedish government refused to bail out Northvolt, suggesting all startups \u2013 sustainable or not \u2013 should be subject to market forces rather than bailed out by taxpayers. But as other parts of the world ramp up battery production and other carbon-cutting industries, the decision has faced a backlash.",
      "\"The US and China have massive support packages for green industry, and they definitely are catching up and overtaking in some sectors. And so that is definitely a threat to be reckoned with,\" argues Andersson.",

      "But while the government insists it wants Sweden to play a key role in Europe's battery industry, and the wider green transition, it has been accused of sending mixed messages. The right-wing coalition, which came into power in 2022 has cut taxes on petrol and diesel, and abolished subsidies for EVs.",
      "\"This is a very politically sensitive area,\" says journalist Cervenka. \"The Swedish government is being actually criticised internationally for not fulfilling its climate obligations. And that is a stark contrast to the image of Sweden as a pioneer.\"",
      "The BBC approached Busch's media team, but was not granted an interview.",

    "summary": "The ruling marks a significant moment in the long running battle over how to regulate internet providers.",
    "story": [
      "A US court has rejected the Biden administration's bid to restore \"net neutrality\" rules, finding that the federal government does not have the authority to regulate internet providers like utilities.",
      "It marks a major defeat for so-called open internet advocates, who have long fought for protections that would require internet providers such as AT&T to treat all legal content equally.",
      "Such rules were first introduced by the Federal Communications Commission under former Democratic president Barack Obama but later repealed during Republican Donald Trump's first term.",
      "The decision, just as Trump is poised to enter the White House for a second term, likely puts an end to the long-running legal battle over the issue.",
      "In their decision, the judges noted that different administrations have gone back and forth on the issue.",
      "But they said the court no longer had to give \"deference\" to the FCC's reading of the law, pointing to a recent Supreme Court decision that limits the authority of federal agencies to interpret laws, a decision that critics expect will be used to weaken regulation in the years ahead.",
      "\"Applying Loper Bright, means we can end the FCC's vacillations,\" the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals said.",
      "Brendan Carr, a Republican member of the FCC who Trump has tapped to lead the agency, said he was pleased the court had invalidated the Biden administration's \"Internet power grab\".",
      "The FCC's outgoing Democratic commissioner said the ruling turned the issue over to Congress.",
      "\"Consumers across the country have told us again and again that they want an internet that is fast, open, and fair,\" Jessica Rosenworcel said.",
      "\"With this decision it is clear that Congress now needs to heed their call, take up the charge for net neutrality, and put open internet principles in federal law.\"",
      "US net neutrality vote: a brief guide",
      "The fight over net neutrality was once a heated issue in the US, pitting internet providers against big tech companies such as Google and Netflix.",
      "Comedian John Oliver famously urged his audience to express support for the rules, leading to a deluge of comments that crashed the government's site.",
      "But the issue has faded in prominence since the rules were repealed in 2018.",
      "Thursday's ruling does not affect state-level net neutrality laws, which in some places offer similar protections.",
      "But advocates, like Mr Oliver, have said that national rules are important to preventing internet providers from having powers to throttle certain content or charge more for speedy delivery of their service.",
      "Public Knowledge, a progressive-leaning internet policy group, said the decision had weakened the FCC's power to shape privacy protections, implement public safety measures and take other action.",
      "It said it believed the court had erred in ruling that internet service providers were simply offering an \"information service\" rather than acting as telecommunications companies.",
      "\"The court has created a dangerous regulatory gap that leaves consumers vulnerable and gives broadband providers unchecked power over Americans' internet access,\" it said.",

      "Alison Edwards, director of policy at bus and coach industry body the Confederation of Passenger Transport, suggested that many people who use bus services would continue to pay well under \u00a33 per journey.",

    "story": [
      "An immigration row has erupted between Donald Trump's supporters over a long-standing US visa programme.",
      "The feud is about H-1B visas, which allow US-based companies to bring in skilled workers from abroad into certain industries.",
      "Critics say the scheme undercuts American workers - but proponents say the visas allow the US to attract the best expertise from around the world.",
      "The president-elect has weighed in, saying he supports the programme - despite being critical of it in the past - and tech billionaire Elon Musk has also defended it, saying it attracts the \"top ~0.1% of engineering talent\".",
      "Here's what the data tell us about who gets into the US on these visas.",
      "How many people are approved each year?",
      "The H-1B visas for skilled workers were introduced in 1990. They are typically granted for three years, but can be extended for up to six years.",
      "Since 2004, the number of new H-1B visas issued has been capped at 85,000 per year - 20,000 of which are reserved for foreign students with master's degrees or higher from US universities.",
      "However, that cap does not apply to some institutions such as universities, think tanks and other non-profit research groups, so more are often issued.",
      "People can only apply for an H-1B visa if they have a job lined up with a US-based sponsor company or institution.",
      "The US government also approves extensions for those already working in the country.",
      "Just over 386,000 H-1B applications were approved in the 2023 fiscal year (October 2022-September 2023), the latest year we have full data for, according to US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) figures.",
      "That includes almost 119,000 new H-1B visas and about 267,000 extensions to existing visas.",
      "The 2023 total is down from more than 474,000 in 2022.",
      "What happened under Trump?",
      "There have been efforts to restrict the H-1B programme further in the past.",
      "In 2017, then-president Trump signed an executive order that increased scrutiny of H-1B visa applications. The order sought to enhance fraud detection within the scheme.",
      "Rejection rates hit an all-time high under the first Trump administration, reaching 24% in the 2018 fiscal year, compared with rejection rates of between 5-8% under the Obama administration and between 2-4% under President Biden.",
      "However, the total number of approved applicants under the Biden administration has been similar to that under Trump's first.",
      "In the three years that followed President Trump's executive order (2018-2020), about 1.1 million applications were approved, with about 343,000 of those being new applicants.",
      "In the first three years of the Biden administration (2021-2023), about 1.2 million applications were approved, with almost 375,000 being new applicants.",
      "Demand often exceeds the amount of visas granted - in most years there are thousands more applications filed than approved.",
      "In cases in which more applications are received than visas are available, the USCIS effectively runs the H-1B programme as a lottery - which detractors believe highlights a fundamental flaw in the system.",
      "\"Ultimately, if you're going to have a skilled worker programme for 'skilled' workers, you don't award these visas via a lottery,\" says Eric Ruark, the director of research at NumbersUSA, an organisation that advocates for tighter immigration controls.",
      "\"Obviously, that's not how you find the best and the brightest.\"",
      "We don't have a full report on the 2024 numbers yet, but preliminary figures suggest applications have increased sharply.",
      "The number of eligible registrations published by the USCIS showed 758,994 applications in 2024, compared with 474,421 in 2023.",

      "\"But the issue for the women especially is that pregnancy is not the concern they have any more, so they're not going to take the precautions. So that's another group that needs to be educated.\"",
      "Arguably the rise in cases is a result of increased testing, as the free \"test and post\" service by Public Health Wales has made that far more accessible.",

      "Syphilis: many people won't have symptoms. But for those that do, it will start with a small, painless ulcer in the mouth or genitals, followed by a rash. If left untreated, the infection can result in visual impairment, dementia and death. In pregnancy it can also lead to miscarriages, still births and infant mortality.",
      "Herpes: again, some people have no symptoms, but they can include small blisters that burst to leave red, open sores around the genitals, rectum, thighs and buttocks. Blisters and ulcers can also be on the cervix; it can cause vaginal discharge, pain when having a wee, as well as general flu-like symptoms.",

    "story": [
      "James Hunt used to spend his days commuting to London, where he ran a successful marketing firm.",
      "But his children Jude and Tommy were diagnosed as autistic when they were toddlers, and he later decided to care for them and his parents full-time.",
      "James, from Burnham-on-Crouch in Essex, started blogging about their lives nine years ago and now has more than a million followers on social media.",
      "Here, in his own words, James speaks about his hopes for the future for his teenage sons.",
      "'It was the hardest period of my life'",
      "When my eldest son Jude was a baby, he was slow to crawl and didn't respond to his name. He used to stare out of the window, he was quite distant and almost in a different world.",
      "His mum Charlotte, my ex-wife, first raised concerns when he was eight months old but I just thought he was a bit behind because he was premature.",
      "We went back to the doctor quite a few times before we got an autism diagnosis in 2009 when he was 18 months old.",
      "At the time, the information out there was very clinical, most things we were reading were from the NHS website and medical journals. I felt like I couldn't take it in and I had so many unanswered questions.",
      "Three years later we went through the same diagnosis with Tommy at a similar age.",
      "I knew a lot more about autism than when we had Jude, but the boys have always been so different.",
      "I didn't enjoy the first year of Tommy's life as much as I could have done because I spent so much time watching him and looking for signs.",
      "He hit certain milestones much quicker than Jude but he wouldn't make eye contact and would get easily frustrated and enjoyed playing alone.",
      "Around the same time, when Jude was four, he started having huge meltdowns and was physically hurting himself.",
      "Jude is non-speaking, so it's very difficult for him to explain what's wrong. That was the hardest period of my life.",
      "He used to wake up in the night screaming and hitting himself. Thankfully as Jude has gotten older, and we've learnt more about how to meet his needs, this has got much better.",
      "'We decided to split the boys up'",
      "Unfortunately at the time Tommy was a huge trigger for him because he was loud and unpredictable. His self-harming would scare Tommy so we used to have to keep them apart a lot.",
      "In 2016, my wife Charlotte and I sadly decided to separate. We took the incredibly difficult decision to split Jude and Tommy up and we felt guilty, like we were failing.",
      "But Jude was immediately like a different child, you could sense his anxiety going, so we knew it was the right decision.",
      "I live in an annexe at my parents' house and help care for my dad who has Parkinson's and my mum, who has dementia, though she is now in a home.",
      "It's opposite my ex-wife's home and I have one of the boys for several nights a week and then we swap over, and I have the other one. They both need one-to-one care and it's impossible for them to live together.",
      "You never imagine life like that. I don't know if they will ever be able to live together but they will always be part of each other's lives.",
      "I wish I could be with both of them at the same time, and I don't get much free time, but this is the best thing for them right now. It has probably made being a single parent easier for me because I'm never alone.",
      "Their school is helping them to do more fun things together like trampolining and eating lunch together.",
      "'I've just had one of my best ever days with them'",
      "Jude is now 16 and loves music so we go on long car drives listening to the radio. It's one of the few places where he feels safe and can relax.",
      "There have been times he's been too anxious to do that and we were housebound but at the moment he's doing OK.",
      "Tommy is 13, and he is cheeky, mischievous, funny, and curious about everything around him. He loves looking at books and puzzles. He isn't fully verbal but he uses a communication device.",
      "I recently had one of the best days I've ever had with Jude and Tommy.",
      "In the past, when we have tried to do anything to celebrate Christmas, it has never gone well, it was too overwhelming for them. But we went to see Father Christmas and made such special memories.",
      "'I've connected with people from all over the world'",
      "Nine years ago I began sharing stories from our lives online, on a weekly blog. Then I started Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok accounts.",
      "It was initially a way to show friends and family what our life was really like. Jude and Tommy struggled with social occasions, so we stopped going.",
      "I could never find the words to explain, and I wanted to show how proud I was of them, so I started writing instead.",
      "I didn't realise how much our stories would resonate with others, or how much it would help me.",
      "I learned so much more about autism, connected with people all over the world and discovered a passion for helping other families.",
      "I've been lucky that I've been able to make a living through social media. I had to give up my previous job to be there for the boys.",
      "I started a clothing line last year, with positive messaging around autism, disabilities and neurodivergence. I love getting messages from people saying they have bumped into someone wearing one of the hoodies, and it started a conversation.",
      "I opened a shop in Burnham-on-Crouch where we stock the clothes and wrap and pack and send out the orders.",
      "It's somewhere for people in the community to visit, we have a sensory room in the shop and we get lots of parents coming in who want to have a chat.",
      "Everyone working in the shop is a parent, carer or is autistic, so they can share their experiences with customers.",
      "'I've learned to cherish the simple things'",
      "I always try to focus on the positives and not think too far ahead but there are days when my mind runs away with me.",
      "It will be a huge challenge when the boys leave school when they are 19.",
      "That's massively scary because suddenly you have to trust a whole new bunch of people.",
      "There is a part-time college I hope they can go to but it's a huge unknown and there will be big decisions to make.",
      "You feel like you have to live forever to look after them, and that is the biggest fear for many parents.",
      "Jude and Tommy will need life-long support, and I've started to realise I might not always be able to provide that for them.",
      "I don't know what the future will look like, but I know I need to think about how to help them live as independently as they can, and prepare for the days when I'm not here.",
      "Autism has meant we've had some of the highest highs, and experienced some lows far lower than I ever knew were imaginable.",
      "It has taught me to cherish and enjoy the simple things and I just want the boys to be happy.",
      "Looking back at how I felt when they were diagnosed, I would like to tell myself it's all going to be OK.",
      "Those first few years can be a really scary and emotional time. You feel like you have no idea what you're doing.",
      "Don't bottle everything up, find people to open up to. Your friends and family want to help, they just don't know how to yet.",
      "You will go through the most challenging and difficult days of your life but you will learn so much from your boys and your love for them will get you through.",

Selena Gomez is also up for two - for the film Emilia P\u00e9rez, about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, and TV mystery comedy Only Murders in the Building.",
      "The event marks the first major ceremony of the film awards season, which culminates with the Oscars on 2 March.",
      "The Globes will be held at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Los Angeles on Sunday evening, beginning at 01:00 GMT on Monday for UK audiences.",
      "A win at the Globes can help boost a film's profile at a crucial time, when Bafta and Oscar voters are preparing to fill in their nomination ballots.",
      "But the Globes is a much less formal event than the Academy Awards, with celebrities generally in a good mood after the Christmas break, ready to mingle over a few drinks and have fun with their acceptance speeches.",

      "Baby Reindeer, Shogun and The Bear are among the shows competing in the TV categories.",
      "In recent years, the voting body behind the Globes has expanded and diversified its membership and brought in a new code of conduct.",
      "The changes follow a scathing investigation by the LA Times in 2021 which exposed various ethical lapses, such as voters accepting \"freebies\" from studios and PR agencies lobbying for nominations.",
      "Which films are nominated at the Globes?",
      "The Golden Globes split their film categories by drama and comedy/musical, which allows them to nominate more movies and hand out more prizes than other ceremonies.",
      "The film with the most nominations is Emilia P\u00e9rez, a largely Spanish-language musical about a dangerous cartel leader who wants to quit the world of crime and live a new life as a woman.",
      "However, several of its 10 nominations are in the same categories - with two nods in best original song and two in best supporting actress.",

      "Nickel Boys, about two young men forced to attend a reform school in 1960s Florida, and September 5, which dramatises the terror attack on the 1972 Munich Olympics from the perspective of the sports journalists who covered it, are also in the running.",

      "Blockbusters including Deadpool & Wolverine, Twisters, Inside Out 2, Gladiator II and The Wild Robot will compete for the cinematic and box office achievement award, which was introduced last year to recognise more mainstream films.",
      "Dune: Part Two was not submitted in that category despite its huge financial success, reportedly because the film's producers wanted Globe voters to focus on its artistic merits.",
      "That means if members want to vote for the film, they will have to do so in the main categories.",
      "Which actors are in the running?",
      "There's a much higher chance of an actor being nominated at the Globes, where there are 36 slots available, than at the Oscars, which have 20.",
      "As a result, the Globes are able to lean in to big celebrity names, ensuring their ceremony is well attended by A-listers, not all of whom will necessarily go on to score an Oscar nomination.",
      "British acting nominees this year include Daniel Craig (Queer) Kate Winslet (Lee), Ralph Fiennes (Conclave), Cynthia Erivo (Wicked) Hugh Grant (Heretic), Tilda Swinton (The Room Next Door) and Felicity Jones (The Brutalist).",

      "Strong's co-star Sebastian Stan has two nominations - one for playing Donald Trump in The Apprentice and one for A Different Man.",
      "But some of the strongest contenders this awards season aren't necessarily Hollywood A-listers, such as relative newcomer Mikey Madison (Anora), Spanish actress Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n (Emilia P\u00e9rez), Brazil's Fernanda Torres (I'm Still Here) and Russian actor Yura Borisov (Anora).",
      "Away from the top categories, other notable nominees include singer Robbie Williams in the best original song category, for Forbidden Road, from his biopic Better Man.",
      "Two of this year's winners have already been announced: Viola Davis will take home the Cecil B DeMille Award, for outstanding contribution to film, while Ted Danson will be honoured with the Carol Burnett Award, for excellence in television.",
      "Who is hosting the Golden Globes?",
      "The Globes have traditionally had excellent taste in hosts, regularly enlisting an acerbic personality to make cutting jokes about the A-list guests.",
      "They are continuing that model this year with US comic Nikki Glaser, who gave a barnstorming performance at The Roast of Tom Brady last summer.",

    "summary": "Will swapping a southern English accent for a Welsh lilt work to gain opponents trust?",
    "story": [
      "This article includes some discussion of the first episode of The Traitors, but does not contain major spoilers such as who the new traitors are or who gets murdered or banished.",
      "Plot twists are happening already in season three of the BBC's The Traitors, as one contestant from London lifted the lid on her charming - but false - Welsh accent.",
      "Charlotte, 33, has lived in London her whole life but has decided to pretend she is from Abergavenny, in Monmouthshire, to maximise her chances of survival.",
      "\"I've been putting on a Welsh accent because my mum's from Wales, it's one of the most trustworthy accents,\" she told the camera on New Year's Day.",
      "But is a Welsh lilt really the key to gaining people's trust as a faithful in the show - and perhaps in life in general?",
      "Winkleman: 'New twists have turned The Traitors on its head'",
      "Banished Traitors star: 'I was out of my depth'",
      "Is commuting changing Welsh accents?",
      "The reality show centres around traitors selected by host Claudia Winkleman, who must deceive and gain the trust of other contestants, who are faithfuls.",
      "Dr Mercedes Durham, a sociolinguistics professor at Cardiff University, led research into the likeability of the Welsh accent and found people associate the accent with being friendly - but not necessarily clever.",
      "\"They genuinely appreciated it, they find it funny, attractive and friendly, but they didn't take it seriously or associate it with intelligence,\" said Dr Durham.",
      "But friendliness and trustworthiness are linked, says Dr Durham, so there could be a method behind the mask.",
      "Inspiration may have come from previous Welsh contestants Andrew Jenkins from Talbot Green, Rhondda Cynon Taf, and Amanda Lovett, from Swansea, who both eliminated faithfuls and narrowly missed out on The Traitors trophy in series one and two.",
      "Amanda sailed through the first series in 2023, with her opponents swearing hand on heart that the humble character could never be a traitor.",
      "\"I think the Welsh accent is very relaxing, it definitely played a role in people trusting me in being a motherly figure,\" said Amanda.",
      "\"Maybe they didn't think I would be sharp enough, or the type capable of murdering, that I was too naive maybe,\" she added.",
      "\"But I don't know if I agree with pinching our Welsh accent,\" Amanda laughed, \"we are very proud of our Welsh heritage\".",
      "Amanda said Traitors fans may even be wary of Welsh contestants this time, as both her and Andrew took their charming accents to the very end.",
      "Andrew agreed the Welsh accent is trustworthy, but said he would have spotted Charlotte's fake effort from a mile off.",
      "\"Oh, I think it's terrible, she keeps dipping in and out of her London accent,\" he said.",
      "\"I just think the Welsh are lovely, friendly, trusting people, I went in and was authentic.",
      "\"I tried to make as many friends as I could and be myself to be honest, I think that helped.\"",
      "Charlotte is not the only Welsh person in the game this year, as Cardiff-based Elen is from north Wales and Leanne is from Holywell in Flintshire.",
      "There is a lot of variation in Welsh accents, and people tend to relate more to certain regions, according to Dr Durham.",
      "\"The main association of people outside of Wales is the south Wales valleys and Barry Island in the Vale of Glamorgan, thanks to Gavin & Stacey,\" she said.",
      "\"Possibly more than the other two contestants, it's an accent outsiders will associate the most with Wales.\"",
      "The Welsh accent has enticed new contact centres to set up or expand in Wales in recent years, including Starling Bank, Capital on Tap, Veezu and TCH Group.",
      "One firm chose Newport, over Middlesbrough, Teesside, to open its funeral planning business, because of the \"consoling\" and \"empathetic\" Welsh accent.",
      "Sandra Busby, chief executive of Cnect Wales, which supports contact centres, said Wales has always been an attractive location for many reasons with accents \"playing their part\".",
      "\"Over the years the Welsh accent always comes in the top three regional accent surveys for friendliness and for being trustworthy,\" she added.",
      "What accents rival the Welsh one?",
      "The Welsh accent took top spot for the most relaxing accent across the UK in 2024, in a study by the University of Sheffield and Spa Seekers.",
      "The public have a soft spot for all Celtic accents, Irish and Scottish included, thanks to their friendly connotations, said Dr Durham.",
      "Received pronunciation, also known as Queen's English, does well to gain people's trust, but mainly because of its social prestige.",
      "But Birmingham, Liverpudlian and Cockney accents are often not favoured and can be found in the lower half of popularity polls.",
      "Trust in accents can change over time depending on our social circles and daily relationships, according to a study by Ilaria Torre from Plymouth University.",
      "Participants heard either a standard southern English accent or a \"lesser trusted\" Liverpudlian accent, and attitudes changed depending on first impressions and judgements.",
      "If a person who spoke in a \"trusted\" accent went on to behave fairly, then this first impression of trustworthiness increased.",
      "Yet if they went on to behave unfairly, they were seen as less trustworthy than those who had both a lesser trusted accent and behaviour.",
      "Participants \"were punishing them, so to speak, for not living up to the participants' expectations\", said Ms Torre.",
      "On the opposite side, those who were seen as sounding \"untrustworthy\" with a Liverpudlian accent but acted nicely were able to reverse negative preconceptions.",
      "So, while a Welsh lilt might start you off in good stead as a trusted contestant, the odds are still all to play for.",
      "With a mixture of different accents from across the UK, how will the Welsh ones do?",
      "You can find out - the first three episodes of The Traitors are now on BBC iPlayer, and the series airs on BBC One at 21:00 GMT on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.",

      "Tourism bosses hope successful productions can see Scotland follow the likes of New Zealand - where the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit films were shot - and Northern Ireland, which saw a tourism upswing from Game of Thrones fans looking to visit locations used in the fantasy series.",
      "Why does Hollywood like Scotland for filming?",
      "For some films, such as Orkney-set drama The Outrun or smash-hit TV show Outlander, filming on location in Scotland is a natural option given the stories themselves are set there.",
      "Scottish scenery and wilderness is distinctive, and can mostly be accessed relatively quickly from major cities, which helps.",
      "However, the past decade has seen cities across the country stand in for other places - something Ray Tallan, the head of film at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, suggests is down to architecture cities like Glasgow and Edinburgh.",
      "He says it \"lends itself beautifully\" to the big screen.",
      "Mr Tallan also points to the increase in studio provision in the country, with the likes of First Stage Studios in Leith and Wardpark Film and Television Studios in Cumbernauld.",
      "Mr Tallan told BBC Scotland News:  \"This gives productions the flexibility to not just use Scotland for its scenery but now also its studio facilities.",
      "\"As more of these productions shoot here successfully, this provides confidence in the sector and an increase in reputation.\"",
      "There is another reason too - money.",
      "Like the rest of the UK, Scotland is able to offer tax breaks to productions, which adds to its appeal, as well as additional funding.",
      "For example, Glasgow City Council gave Warner Bros around \u00a3150,000 to shoot DC Comics film Batgirl in the city - only for the finished movie to never see the light of day after bosses at the studio decided not to release it.",
      "What locations can Scottish cities double as?",
      "Glasgow has been particularly adaptable, with its streets doubling for London in the  Fast & Furious spin-off Hobbs & Shaw, as legendary comic book location Gotham City in the opening of comic book adventure The Flash, and as 1960s New York for a parade scene in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.",

      "She explained: \"It's not only the film being made there but whether certain conditions are met, mainly related to destination management and marketing.",
      "\"It highlights the importance of something like Visit Scotland, in having a marketing strategy implemented before and after filming.\"",
      "What is the Outlander effect on Scottish tourism?",

      "Several companies now offer Outlander tours around Scotland, visiting locations used throughout the long-running series.",

      "Later this month, two multiplex cinemas within 20 miles of each other will close down.",
      "But while one of them will get a new lease of life with a new operator, one will be demolished to be replaced by a storage site.",
      "What is happening in Northampton and Kettering is symptomatic of cinema closures across the UK, but there are also new sites and operators opening.",
      "So what is the state of play within the cinema industry?",
      "What cinemas have been closing?",
      "The Point in Milton Keynes was one of the UK's first multiplex cinemas when it opened in 1985. The site showed its last film in 2015, and last year it was saved from demolition.",
      "The city got two new multiplex cinemas, which was a pattern repeated elsewhere, where older sites have been replaced by more modern venues.",
      "But during the pandemic, cinema chains began to suffer as screens were closed for several months. When they reopened, there were drops in both the number of films and audiences.",
      "In 2023, both Empire Cinemas and Cineworld went into administration.",
      "Irish chain Omniplex bought five of the Empire Cinema sites. It then announced it would close the cinema in Ipswich, but that decision was later reversed.",

      "But the Odeon in Kettering is set to be demolished following its closure later this month after the landlord said it was no longer viable.",
      "Why have cinemas been closing?",
      "Despite some huge hits, including Inside Out 2 and Deadpool & Wolverine, 2024 was not a good year financially for films, says Charles Gant, the awards/box office editor at Screen International.",
      "\"There was a feeling that we would get back to pre-pandemic levels relatively quickly [but] it became apparent it wasn't an instant recovery,\" he says.",
      "\"The recovery has completely stalled and that is to do with the release calendar, which was impacted by the Hollywood strikes.\"",
      "In 2023, both writers and actors in the United States took industrial action, which halted the production of several major films and delayed their release.",

      "He says the November releases of Gladiator II, Wicked, and Paddington in Peru \"certainly helped every cinema around the world\".",
      "Mr Clifford, who has also worked for Cineworld and Vue, adds that audiences \"haven't seen the wider range of films\" with fewer documentaries, British films and foreign films released.",
      "Phil Clapp, chief executive of the UK Cinema Association, says: \"Some cinemas which would've been economic to run before the pandemic, before recent [financial] challenges, are no longer economic and so they're being closed in many cases.\"",
      "Some of those will be reopened by other operators, he says, \"but inevitably it will mean that some communities lose their local cinema, [which] really does have an impact\".",
      "Is smaller the future?",
      "Mr Gant says cinemas face rising costs as many industries do, in particular with energy and staffing.",
      "\"They are large buildings and some of them are probably not built in the most energy-efficient manner,\" he says.",
      "\"Some of the stuff that got built in the 1990s are these of out-of-town sheds.\"",
      "But new cinemas are opening and Mr Clapp says operators recognise they need to \"offer something more than people would get at home\".",
      "\"The general trend is to more reclining sofas [and] a more upscale experience, and part of that is a move away from the large auditoriums with hundreds of seats,\" he says.",
      "He adds that rather than looking only at capacity, cinemas want to increase occupancy or, \"put simply, bums on seats\".",
      "\"That's the general direction of travel for many in the UK cinema sector and indeed in European and global cinemas,\" he says.",
      "But he adds: \"There is an audience out there still for the big-screen experience.\"",
      "Mr Clifford says a smaller venue such as Northampton Filmhouse \u2013 which has two screens, each with a capacity of about 90 \u2013 can have \"a different kind of audience that comes on a regular basis\".",
      "\"They come here so regularly. They come and see everything we put on,\" he says.",
      "Will 2025 be better for cinemas?",

      "The Traitors has returned to our screens, with its usual combination of murders, missions and midnight meetings. The number of contestants this year has risen to 25 - ranging from a former British diplomat to even a member of the clergy.",
      "\"I just love a good murder,\" says the priest, Lisa, in the opening episode, revealing that she's \"had a chat\" with the man upstairs about the ethics of taking part. But, she concludes: \"Any self-respecting murder mystery needs to have a priest in it.\"",
      "Wednesday's launch saw her joined by a retired opera singer, beautician, landscaper, swimming teacher, window cleaner, financial investigator and British Army soldier.",
      "But although the players are different, and a few key changes have been made to the format (more on those in a sec), the show's core principles remain.",
      "\"The absolute beauty of the Traitors is the game itself,\" says presenter Claudia Winkleman. \"I get messages all the time from people playing it in theatres, on film sets, in schools, even a Traitors wedding - I agree, too much.\"",
      "The presenter says she feels \"completely terrified\" by the launch of series three - fearful both of accidentally revealing spoilers and also whether audiences will like the show as much as the previous series. \"I don't exhale until January 24th,\" she jokes.",
      "\"It is such an honour to be in that round table and to see how it unfolds, so I feel incredibly lucky and love it, and you just don't want people to be disappointed, because the people who like [the show] are so vocal.\"",
      "The Traitors is one of the BBC's biggest success stories of recent years. The first UK series was watched by a total audience of around five million, the second by more than eight million.",
      "A true watercooler hit, it is one of the few shows in the streaming age which viewers feel they are watching at the same time as everyone else.",
      "Format changes",
      "Several tweaks have been made to the central format this year, although it's not yet clear how big an impact they'll have.",
      "One early twist in this series is somewhat reminiscent of the first, as three contestants are made to leave before they've even entered Ardross Castle in Inverness.",
      "\"When they turn up, they assume they know the way the game is going to go, and it is our job to explain that it isn't,\" Winkleman says of the changes.",
      "\"There are twists throughout, but they have to be different from series one and two. They've come to hopefully walk away with up to \u00a3120,000, but also to play a game, and I like the fact that they don't know which way it's going to go.\"",
      "It remains to be seen whether there might be a way back later in the series for the contestants who sacrificed themselves, as there was in series one for Amos and Kieran, the two players who were ejected at the castle doors.",
      "Perhaps more significantly, Winkleman tells the new crop that the few contestants who make it to the final this year will no longer reveal whether they are a faithful or traitor as they are banished.",
      "Instead, the remaining players will have to rely solely on their instincts about whether or not any Traitors are left, ultimately making their decision of when to end the game harder.",
      "\"It underlines... the main body of the show, which is trust and gut instinct,\" Winkleman says. \"You're going to like the end, I hope, that's all I can say, it throws it all on its head.\"",
      "It's hard to predict how this might impact the final in practice. Had this rule been in place last year, it may actually have made it easier for Harry to win, as Andrew's last-minute attempt to bring his fellow traitor down before being banished might not have aroused as much suspicion with Jaz.",
      "\u2018Winning formula\u2019",
      "Critics were broadly positive about Wednesday\u2019s series launch, but some noted the show will have to continue innovating to keep things fresh.",
      "\u201cThe Traitors, like its players, must constantly adapt, so the brutality must be upped,\u201d said Carol Midgley of the Times.",
      "\u201cBut I think it needs to twist the screws a lot more than this if it wants to hold a candle to last year's show.\u201d",
      "The Independent\u2019s Nick Hilton noted: \u201cThis third season of The Traitors is, naturally, more self-aware. Contestants know the various gameplans employed, know that the producers keep several cards up their sleeves.",
      "\u201cThere is a sense that competitors want to guarantee more screentime by playing games within the games, presumably at the encouragement of the production team.\u201d",
      "But the Evening Standard\u2019s El Hunt said: \u201cAll of the key ingredients are already in place. Though it's initially hard to get to know 22 contestants, the leaders, court jesters, and potential threats are all beginning to emerge already. A winning formula strikes again.\u201d",
      "In the opening episode, one of the new contestants shrewdly suggests that more of the Traitors this year might be women, after those in the last series were predominantly men.",
      "\"There is a little bit of that, and you'll see how it works out for us,\" Winkleman tells journalists, giving nothing further away.",
      "But, the presenter adds, she does not choose the traitors by herself. Instead, she explains: \"We talk to all of them, and then six of us go up to a room, the brilliant casting people, and we get through seven packets of biscuits.",
      "\"I'm the smallest voice in the room, but you decide while having had those chats who it's going to be.\"",
      "There are two sisters taking part this year, although they are open from the beginning about their relation to each other - unlike some contestants in previous series.",
      "Their casting is part of the wider effort to make sure the show is always slightly different, with new people, new personality types, and new relationships.",
      "\"In any entertainment format, you can't repeat,\" Winkleman reflects. \"You want to give the people who are playing and watching, something new. So yes, two sisters, let's see how that works.\"",
      "Some of the latest crop have come up with innovative new tactics - one contestant is attempting to maintain a fake Welsh accent throughout her time in the game.",
      "\"I get it, if you're playing a game of deception, why not start at the beginning?\" Winkleman reflects.",
      "The presenter's biggest fear is accidentally giving away the traitors' identities while filming the roundtables. \"I am absolutely paranoid about ever looking at the traitors, so I sort of look just above everybody's head.\"",
      "By her own admission, Winkleman gets emotionally involved in the series and keeps in touch with contestants after they've been on the show.",
      "\"I love them, each and every one, all of them,\" she smiles. \"I was texting Maddy from series one the other day, I sent a message to Charlotte's aunt.",
      "\"Matt from series one wanted to show me his new skill - sorry, that sounds like code, it was skateboarding. Aubrey sends me pictures of his living room.",
      "\"But I stay in touch with all of them because I'm so grateful to them for playing the way they do. And these people [in the new series] are extraordinary game players.\"",
      "The first two episodes of The Traitors are now on BBC iPlayer. The rest of the series will air at 21:00 GMT on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday nights.",

    "published": "Wed, 01 Jan 2025 00:46:51 GMT",
    "summary": "Willem Dafoe reflects on the appeal of Dracula: \"It's interesting to have the undead visit the living\".",
    "story": [
      "When I meet Willem Dafoe on Zoom to discuss his latest movie Nosferatu, we get on to mortality fast.",
      "The four-time Oscar-nominated actor is talking to me for Radio 4's Today programme about Robert Eggers' remake of the 1922 silent film of the same name, which was an unauthorised adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula.",
      "Nosferatu is the tale of a terrifying vampire who is infatuated with a haunted young woman called Ellen, played by Lily-Rose Depp.",
      "The story that unfolds involves a lot of death. Where creatures that feed on human blood are concerned, that's pretty standard. But Dafoe, who plays a vampire-hunting professor of the occult in the film, tells me in real life too \"we're all somewhere considering death all the time\".",
      "For him, that's one explanation for the popularity of vampire stories.",
      "Bram Stoker's novel Dracula has been adapted numerous times, and vampires in general are never far from our screens.",
      "Dafoe rationalises the enduring appeal of the subgenre like this: \"It's a very interesting proposition to have the undead visit the living, and it becomes something of a meditation of the dark side of things versus the light\".",
      "Even if we don't know it, he muses, all of us are always addressing this type of conflict in some form.",
      "An interview with Dafoe is never dull; he's a thoughtful and intelligent actor, who, for the best part of 50 years, has combined big Hollywood successes (Spiderman movies, John Wick, Born on the Fourth of July) with the arthouse films he relishes.",
      "He dropped out of university in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to join an experimental theatre company but, since those early days, his voracious work ethic and intense appeal as perhaps the greatest living character actor have seen him in more than 130 films. His debut, Heaven's Gate, was in 1980. Seven years later, he was first nominated for an Oscar for the Vietnam war film Platoon.",
      "Dafoe was crucified as Jesus in The Last Temptation of Christ and cut off his ear as Van Gogh in At Eternity's Gate. He spent six hours a day in the prosthetics make-up chair to morph into a reclusive scientist in Poor Things, and he has even been a version of a vampire himself, in Shadow of the Vampire.",
      "While the original 1922 silent movie by F.W. Murnau pioneered some early special effects, including superimposing the image of Nosferatu on to a ship to create a frightening ghostly glow, Eggers goes for an earthy take, grounded in history and reality.",
      "There were 2,000 real live rats on set.",
      "It's perfect for Dafoe, who tells me he doesn't like to work too much with computer-generated imagery (the green screen and other visual effects that have become integral to filmmaking).",
      "\"You need to earn the authority to pretend, and through the technology, that gets lost\".",
      "Don't expect well-trodden vampire movie fare in this Nosferatu. Count Orlok doesn't have the symmetrical fanged teeth we're used to. This vampire isn't a suave seducer in a high-collared black cloak.",
      "Dafoe says Eggers wanted to get back to \"a time when people actually believed in vampires\". To do this, \"he went for a much more folk-based vampire\".",
      "The actor believes this is \"why this Orlok in the movie is so very different to anything we've ever seen before\".",
      "The film is packed with talent popular with Gen Z (Lily-Rose Depp, Nicholas Hoult, Emma Corrin). The cast - and the status of the 1922 original in the film firmament - means Eggers' movie had achieved a cult-like following even before its release.",
      "In the US, that was on Christmas Day. I asked whether Dafoe thought a movie about a bloodsucking, diseased creature and the horror he unleashes on a 19th Century German town was the perfect antidote to a day of family festivities.",
      "He pointed to \"the shadow side\" of these occasions, \"a time when some people fall into depression because they fall out of that happiness\".",
      "It's true that his film work offers up both sides - the joy and the pain of life, the extremes of being human and everything in-between.",
      "He tells me that if you don't recognise there is a shadow side to life, \"you're going to become a victim of it some day\".",
      "As I look at him on the computer screen, it's impossible not to reflect on how expressive his face is - a face that could be carved from the earth.",
      "He tells me he only realised it when he started being photographed on the red carpet.",
      "\"Man, they get some ugly pictures of me. They get some grotesque pictures and they get some nice pictures\".",
      "He puts that down to his face having \"range\".",
      "\"I never think about my face,\" he goes on. \"If I ever do, it's really just to tell it to calm down\".",
      "Nosferatu is released in the UK on 1 January 2025.",

    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 15:56:57 GMT",
    "summary": "The pair were married for two years - but it has taken four times that time to reach a divorce deal.",
    "story": [
      "Arguably the modern era's biggest A-list couple, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt were married for two years - but it has taken eight years since announcing their divorce to finally reach a deal. Why did it take four times as long as the marriage itself to settle?",
      "One part of the answer is that it's a particularly messy divorce, complicated by  bitter legal disputes involving their children and a French vineyard they bought together.",
      "Some of that still needs to be resolved in what Jolie's lawyer has called \"a long ongoing process\".",
      "Celebrity lawyer Chris Melcher told BBC News the divorce settlement had taken an unusually long time.",
      "\"This is much longer than any divorce we typically see,\" he said.",
      "\"But they initially had fights over custody and then it revolved around this winery they own together, and that's been the focus of their fight over the last few years.\"",
      "Many celebrities want to divorce quickly and move on, Melcher explained.",
      "\"A lot of times in a case of this magnitude we can settle it within six months, a year at the very most. Eight years is really a sign of something more going on.",
      "\"It's an inability to let go and a desire to really harm the other.\"",
      "Kate Daly, co-founder of online divorce company Amicable, told the BBC that such a case was very different from an average divorce.",
      "\"It's an industry... [they can afford] lots of expensive lawyers,\" she said. \"Most people couldn't afford for it to take eight years. It's an industry and it's a bad example - we have to distance [normal] people from that kind of narrative.\"",
      "Romantic beginning",
      "Jolie, 49, and Pitt, 61, got together after meeting on the set of the film Mr & Mrs Smith, which was released in 2005.",
      "\"Because of the film, we ended up being brought together to do all these crazy things, and I think we found this strange friendship and partnership that kind of just suddenly happened,\" Jolie told Vogue in 2007.",
      "Both had been married before - Pitt to Friends star Jennifer Aniston, and Jolie to actors Jonny Lee Miller (1996 to 2000) and Billy Bob Thornton (2000 to 2003).",
      "Jolie and Pitt share six children together.",
      "Jolie adopted Maddox from Cambodia in 2002 a few months after he was born. Pitt later adopted him after he and Jolie had begun their relationship.",
      "In 2005, the pair adopted daughter Zahara from Ethiopia when she was a few months old.",
      "The couple's first biological child, Shiloh, was born in Namibia in 2006. Earlier this year, it was reported that Shiloh had submitted a petition to a court to drop Pitt from her name.",
      "Their son Pax was adopted at the age of three from Vietnam in 2007, and twins Knox and Vivienne were born in 2008.",
      "Beginning of the end",
      "The couple made their final red carpet appearance together in November 2015 for a film they both starred in, By the Sea. It was about an unhappily married couple, and was written and directed by Jolie.",
      "The couple rarely discussed their relationship but when promoting the film, Jolie told The Telegraph: \"Brad and I have our issues.",
      "\"We have fights and problems like any other couple. We have days when we drive each other absolutely mad and want space, but the problems in the movie aren't our specific problems.\"",
      "The news that Jolie was filing for divorce, citing \"irreconcilable differences\", came as a shock to many in September 2016.",
      "'Vitriolic hatred'",
      "It emerged that she filed for divorce a day after an incident on board a private plane.",
      "Pitt was initially alleged to have hit son Maddox, then 15, on the flight from France to Los Angeles. The FBI and social workers examined the claims, but neither took any action. Pitt denied wrongdoing.",
      "Then in 2022, legal papers from the vineyard dispute revealed that Jolie accused Pitt of drunkenly attacking her and two children during the flight.",
      "At the time, a source close to the actor told the BBC that her claims were false.",
      "Speaking to Vogue in 2020, Jolie said she left Pitt for the \"wellbeing\" of her family.",
      "\"It was the right decision,\" she said. \"I continue to focus on their healing.\"",
      "In an interview with GQ in 2017, Pitt spoke about his decision to quit drinking and smoking marijuana, saying the split had been a \"huge generator for change\".",
      "Regarding the divorce, Pitt said he and Jolie had decided to abandon a path of \"vitriolic hatred\" and work together to sort out their issues, adding that they were committed to resolving matters amicably and privately.",
      "Custody battle",
      "Their attempts to reach agreements over the divorce and custody of their children appeared to be acrimonious and protracted.",
      "In 2019, a judge declared that the couple were officially single, but that the divorce still needed to be finalised.",
      "They reached a custody deal in 2018, but that appeared to fall apart. In 2021, Pitt was granted joint custody after a court battle, but the private judge who oversaw the case was later removed because he did not disclose his business relationships with Pitt's lawyers.",
      "That raised the prospect of a fresh custody case, but nothing has been made public.",
      "And while the divorce saga may now be drawing to a close, there is another legal battle still ongoing - to do with the vineyard.",
      "Pitt and Jolie bought Chateau Miraval together in 2008 and got married in its small chapel in 2014.",
      "But Jolie sold her share to a spirits manufacturer owned by a Russian oligarch, according to Pitt's lawsuit. He is suing his ex-wife for selling her stake in the estate, saying they agreed not to sell their shares without the permission of the other. Jolie has not publicly commented.",
      "Emotional fallout",
      "Few details of the divorce proceedings have been revealed. Private judges are often hired in the US to mediate disputes between divorcing celebrities for privacy reasons.",
      "Their children are now all aged between 16 and 23, and showbiz journalist Jeanne Wolf emphasised the emotional fallout.",
      "\"It's been a very emotional and complicated divorce settlement. It's taken a big toll on the children and the couple involved,\" she said.",
      "\"They have tried very hard not to let too many details known about what went on in that marriage.\"",
      "Jolie's lawyer highlighted the passage of time in his statement on Monday. \"This is just one part of a long ongoing process that started eight years ago,\" he said.",
      "\"Frankly, Angelina is exhausted, but she is relieved this one part is over.\"",
      "Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt reach divorce deal",
      "Brad sues Angelina over vineyard wedding venue",
      "My kids saw my pain on set, says Angelina Jolie",
      "Brad Pitt awarded joint custody of children",

    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 16:14:42 GMT",
    "summary": "He was one of radio's 60s rebels.  More than 50 years later, after many ups and downs he was still broadcasting as the BBC's 'Sounds of the 70s'.",
    "story": [
      "Johnnie Walker's long radio career was shaped by his early years as a pirate broadcaster in the 1960s, bobbing around on the ocean on Radio Caroline.",
      "Even 50 years later, his wife Tiggy would refer to him as \"the pirate\".",
      "It remained more than apt, given that his subsequent time on mainstream radio was marked by more than a few battles with the bosses.",
      "Radio 2 DJ Johnnie Walker dies at the age of 79",
      "Radio 2 DJ Johnnie Walker dies at the age of 79",
      "Rebel spirit",
      "His DJ career began at the age of 21, when he was first given a chance to play records on 'Swinging' Radio England, a boat moored four miles off the Essex coast.",
      "In return, they asked that he change his name - from Peter Dingley to the rather more rock 'n' roll-sounding Johnnie Walker.",
      "The boat was one of a number of floating stations that had taken advantage of a loophole in the law that allowed them to get round the BBC's monopoly on the UK airwaves to bring the sound of 60s pop to the nation's radios - something the BBC had up to that point largely resisted.",
      "Walker took to the rebel spirit. His years at public school had fostered a loathing of authority, and he had gone out of his way to fail his O-levels. Radio allowed him to embrace his passion - music - especially the rock, soul and underground sounds that were not making it to the top of the singles chart.",
      "Occasionally, he would row across to another boat, Radio London, to chat to a kindred spirit, a young DJ who was beginning to make a name for himself, John Peel.",
      "It wasn't tea he was talking about",
      "Walker then moved to the pirate mothership, Radio Caroline.",
      "His style was laid back, conversational and a contrast to the highly formatted slick patter of many other DJs.",
      "That attitude may have had something to do with his favoured means of relaxation on board. He even had an on-air code - he said the boat was running short of tea to signal that they were running out of his preferred type of herbal cigarette.",
      "His time on board also coincided with the government\u2019s decision to crack down on the pirates. Walker was on air at midnight of 14 August 1967, when the law making the pirates illegal came in to force.",
      "He read out a defiant speech declaring: \"We belong to you and we love you.\" His reputation as a symbol of the spirit of the pirates was assured.",
      "Undone by the Bay City Rollers",
      "However, in 1969 he switched sides and joined the establishment, BBC Radio One. It was not the easiest of relationships.",
      "He was, he said, accused of being \"too into the music\". He would pepper his shows with album tracks and songs outside the approved playlist.",
      "When he championed Walk on the Wild Side, Lou Reed\u2019s song about sex, drugs and transgender bohemia, his BBC boss had questions. It only stayed on the playlist because they had never encountered the phrase \"giving head\".",
      "Walker also loved Bruce Springsteen and the Eagles; Chirpy, Chirpy Cheep, Cheep, not so much.",
      "The cheery, cheeky sound of 70s mainstream radio was not his thing. At one Radio One event, he and Peel remembered watching, stunned, as fans of the Bay City Rollers brought chaos.",
      "\"Bay City Roller fans were jumping into the lake to be near their idols who were in a boat. John Peel turned to me and said, 'Johnnie, take note, this is one of the most bizarre sights you will ever see'.",
      "\"And then speeding into view came Tony Blackburn in another boat, being steered by a Womble.\"",
      "Cocaine, court and punk rock",
      "Not long after that, he parted company with Radio One after describing the Bay City Rollers as \"musical garbage\". He decided to leave for the freedom of US radio. It had its ups and downs.",
      "KSAN in San Francisco, with its relaxed FM rock playlist, seemed a perfect match until punk came along. It was not to the manager's taste and Walker was soon looking for work elsewhere.",
      "His sideline of sending pre-recorded shows back to Radio Luxembourg also came to an end when he played a record at the wrong speed.",
      "By the early 80s, he was back in the UK and on the dole.",
      "His return to the airwaves included a spell in independent local radio before he returned to the BBC. He again came a cropper at BBC GLR after saying there would be dancing in the streets when Margaret Thatcher resigned as prime minister in 1990.",
      "But, despite the setbacks, he eventually found a home at Radio 2.",
      "However, that almost came to an end when the News of the World's infamous fake sheikh staged a sting in 1999 and got him to reveal his drug habit. It was, he said, his lowest point. But after a trip to rehab, a \u00a32,000 fine and a promise that he had changed his ways, he was allowed back on to Radio 2.",
      "And that is where he stayed. He was even awarded an MBE.",
      "Sounds of the 70s",
      "The music that had been frowned on by the bosses in the 70s was now classic rock and he had a loyal fanbase who recognised him as one of their own.",
      "Being \"too into the music\" had paid off, he was now the authentic voice of the Sounds of the 70s.",
      "He presented the show of that name, and Radio 2's Rock Show, until health problems forced him to retire in October, after 58 years on the air.",

      "On 22 December 2023, Saltburn was released on Amazon Prime. By 5 January 2024, Murder on the Dancefloor was back in the top 10 and would spend five weeks at number two, only kept off the top spot by Noah Kahan's Stick Season.",
      "\"The year started with an old friend Murder on the Dancefloor taking me for another twirl,\" is how she sums it up.",

      "Murder on the Dancefloor was also her ticket to singing at the Bafta Film Awards, making a guest appearance during the DJ Peggy Gou's headlining set on the Park stage at Glastonbury, and even performing in front of King Charles at the Royal Variety Show.",
      "\"There is so much to reflect on. It's an extraordinary thing to get to my stage in my career and still be doing new things, new excitement. So, I really wanted to grab hold of that.\"",

      "Last year more than seven million people were watching as Rick Astley handed over to Big Ben.",
      "Ellis-Bextor says that for the last two months, and whilst on tour supporting the Human League, she has been using down time to plan extensively for the show, with her husband and musical director, Richard Jones, who is also the bass player for The Feeling.",
      "\"New Year's Eve is such a big deal, and I don't take it lightly if people are choosing to spend it with us,\" she confides.",

      "And 2025 will, of course, start with Murder on the Dancefloor, \"but after a little bit of Auld Lang Syne,\" she clarifies.",

      "They will be duetting on two of Scissor Sisters' best-known tracks, including Take Your Mama, which will feature what Ellis-Bexter describes as \"an epic guitar solo\" by Emily Roberts, from the Brit-winning group The Last Dinner Party.",

      "Indeed, indie music is where Ellis-Bexter started out. She first made the charts in 1998 as lead singer of theaudience, a band who made up for their lack of capital letters and use of the space bar with a couple of rather catchy Smiths influenced post-Britpop top 40 hits.",

      "\"That's why we're setting out the specific steps - not just the investment, but the reform to make the NHS easier and more convenient to use, to give patients more choice, to get rid of the waste and inefficiency we see in the NHS,\" Streeting said on BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg.",
      "Announcing the plan, he said the move would shift the NHS \"into the digital age\" and help cut waiting times \"from 18 months to 18 weeks\".",
      "The app would \"put patients in the driving seat and treat them on time\", and they would be \"put in control of their own healthcare\", the health secretary said.",
      "Action will also be taken to tackle missed appointments, which can be costly for the health service, including an artificial intelligence pilot to help pinpoint patients that may need extra help to attend.",
      "The Department of Health said the NHS app would allow more patients needing non-urgent treatment to view and manage appointments.",
      "The first step of the plan will come into force in March, when patients at more than 85% of acute trusts will be able to view their appointments on the NHS app.",
      "Reminders would be sent out by hospitals to reduce the number of appointments missed.",
      "\"You book a table in a restaurant these days - or even an appointment at the hairdresser - you'll get a text message 24 or 48 hours in advance to remind you. Why doesn't the NHS do this?\" Streeting said.",
      "Diagnostic tests could be booked at specialist centres with the results coming through more quickly.",
      "Patients will also be able to contact their healthcare provider and receive regular updates, including how long they are likely to wait.",
      "They already have the right to choose where they would like their treatment, including in the private sector, but are not always told that. Details of NHS and independent providers will be made clearer through the app.",
      "Some of these features are already available on the NHS app and a website Manage Your Referral. But officials say just 8% of bookings are made through these platforms.",
      "Other plans include expanding a scheme for GPs to discuss some cases with\u00a0 hospital specialists before making referrals to ensure patients are treated in the right setting.",
      "The current Advice and Guidance Scheme has resulted in 50% of cases being directed to more appropriate care rather than being put on long waiting lists and so reducing pressure on hospitals. These include some ear, nose and throat conditions.",
      "GPs will also be able to refer patients with certain conditions directly for tests or scans without the need to see a consultant first. The aim is to reduce waiting times and remove those who are given the all clear from waiting lists.",
      "Amanda Pritchard, chief executive of NHS England, said using technology would revolutionise access to healthcare and put \"patients in the driving seat of elective care\".",
      "But the chairman of the BMA council, Professor Phil Banfield, said the focus should be on patients most in need rather than a \"wasteful obsession\" with artificial targets.",
      "He said there was a danger patients without access to tablets and smartphones would be alienated.",

    "story": [
      "The number of people with flu in hospital in England has quadrupled over the past month and is rising \"at a very concerning rate\", NHS chiefs have warned.",
      "Latest data shows there were 5,000 patients with the virus being treated in hospital at the end of last week - almost 3.5 times higher than the same week in 2023, although not as high as in 2022.",
      "The head of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine told the BBC that pressure on hospitals is \"unacceptably awful\" and flu is pushing them to breaking point.",
      "It comes as health officials warn about the impact of the very cold weather expected this weekend on vulnerable patients, and the health system.",
      "Prof Julian Redhead, NHS national clinical director for urgent and emergency care, said the figures show \"the pressure from flu was nowhere near letting up before we headed into the new year, skyrocketing to over 5,000 cases a day in hospital as of the end of last week and rising at a very concerning rate\".",
      "\"With what looks like an extreme cold snap expected right across England ahead of the weekend, we know the low temperatures can be dangerous for those who are vulnerable or have respiratory conditions,\" he added.",
      "Prof Redhead says people at risk should try to keep warm and make sure they are stocked up on any regular medication.",
      "It is not unusual to see an increase in flu during winter. The UK Health Security Agency says \"this was anticipated\" and that is why it has been urging those eligible to have a free flu vaccine, particularly health and social care workers.",
      "Some 33% of pregnant women, 37% of people in an at-risk group and 73% of over-65s have had the jab, according to the latest vaccination figures.",
      "'Lack of beds'",
      "Hospitals have put extra beds in place this year to help deal with the pressure on admissions created by flu and other winter viruses, including Covid and norovirus (the winter vomiting bug).",
      "NHS chiefs say they have also added more support for people who frequently need emergency services, with more care being delivered outside hospitals.",
      "Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said the NHS had done \"all it could\" in advance to reduce risk to patients, but the service remained in a position of \"national vulnerability\" with \"intense pressures\" starting to impact local services.",
      "Figures for last week show some 12,200 patients were left waiting in ambulances for more than an hour before they could be cared for in hospital.",
      "Dr Adrian Boyle, head of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it was a very difficult time for both patients and staff.",
      "\"What we are seeing is ambulances are frequently stuck outside emergency departments, and our emergency departments are full.\"",
      "He said there was \"an enormous amount of avoidable harm - excess deaths that shouldn't be happening\".",
      "\"Flu is the straw that is breaking the camel's back - because we have this chronic lack of beds within our hospitals, and we don't use those beds properly because we haven't reformed social care,\" he added.",
      "His criticism comes on the day the health and social care secretary set out plans for reforming adult social care in England, although they are unlikely to be delivered before 2028 at the earliest.",
      "A number of hospitals across different regions in England have restricted visits and asked patients and visitors to wear face masks to prevent further spread of flu.",
      "In Scotland, there has also been a large rise in the number of people in hospital with flu. Earlier this week, First Minister John Swinney said the NHS was under \"very significant pressures\".",
      "A Welsh government spokesperson said there were continued \"high levels of demand\" on urgent and emergency care services this winter, and an increase in flu cases had added further pressure during the Christmas period.",

      "People socialising with friends and family during the Christmas festivities will likely have added to the spread of the virus.",
      "Health officials saw the flu wave coming, and have been urging people to take up the offer of a free flu vaccine for some time.",
      "However, the number of people who have been vaccinated is lower than officials had hoped - just over a third of higher-risk adults have had the jab to date.",
      "Several different strains of flu tend to circulate each winter, and the vaccine was created in advance to combat the current, predicted wave. According to health officials, the vaccine is doing its job.",

    "story": [
      "Wes Streeting has defended the timescale for reforming adult social care in England, with proposals on its long-term funding unlikely to be delivered before 2028.",
      "The health and social care secretary is promising \"to finally grasp the nettle on social care reform\", but said on Friday the process \"would take time\".",
      "The independent commission, chaired by Baroness Louise Casey, will begin work in April but is not due to publish its final report until 2028.",
      "Sarah Woolnough, chief executive of health think-tank The King's Fund, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the timescale \"feels far too long\" and urged the government to look at measures that could be implemented sooner.",
      "Other councils and care providers have said the final 2028 report is too long to wait for the long-term reform of vital services already on their knees.",
      "The commission comes alongside immediate government plans to get care workers to do more health checks, and a funding boost for services to help elderly and disabled people remain in their homes.",
      "It will be split into two phases, the first of which will report by mid-2026 and identify critical issues and recommend medium-term improvements.",
      "But phase two, which will look at how to organise care services and fund them for the future, will not report until 2028 - a year before when the next election must be held.",
      "The government's ultimate aim is \"a new National Care Service, able to meet the needs of older and disabled people into the 21st Century\", said Streeting.",
      "He rejected the suggestion the government is pushing social care reform into the long grass, saying it is \"already acting\" and had \"done a lot in the first six months\".",
      "Ms Woolnough told the Today programme the government should \"get on and do a whole range of things that [it] can now\" and then accelerate the timetable for further reform.",
      "\"Measures to help the workforce, measures to improve quality and so on, you don't need a commission to enable you to do a whole load of stuff,\" she added.",
      "Social care means help for older or disabled people with day-to-day tasks such as washing, dressing, medication and eating.",
      "Only those with the most complex health needs get social care provided free by the NHS, so most care is paid for by councils.",
      "In England, only people with high needs and savings or assets of less than \u00a323,250 are eligible for that help, leaving a growing number of people to fund themselves.",
      "Some face paying hundreds of thousands of pounds for their care and may be forced to sell their own home as a result.",
      "Streeting said he had invited opposition parties to take part in the commission \"to build a cross-party consensus to ensure the National Care Service survives governments of different shades, just as our NHS has for the past 76 years\".",
      "He told BBC Breakfast there was \"genuine desire\" from across the political spectrum \"to work together\", calling it \"a big moment for social care\".",
      "When asked if proposed funding for the sector was enough, the health secretary said public services were \"on their knees\" and \"there's so much more that needs to be done\", but the process \"would take time\".",
      "Baroness Casey - who has led several high-profile reviews, including into homelessness, the Rotherham child exploitation scandal and the Metropolitan Police - said she was pleased \"to lead this vital work\". The commission will report to the prime minister.",
      "She is viewed in government as being straight-talking, with good cross-party links, and as someone who gets things done.",
      "Even so, drawing up a plan for a National Care Service that meets the needs of an ageing population and is affordable is perhaps her biggest challenge yet.",
      "There is agreement the care system has been in crisis for years, struggling with growing demand, under-funding and staff shortages.",
      "The problem has been getting political agreement on how overdue reform will be funded.",
      "In 2010, Labour plans to fund social care were labelled a \"death tax\" in that year's election, and Conservative plans were called a \"dementia tax\" in the 2017 election.",
      "There have also been numerous commissions, reviews and inquiries over the past 25 years that have failed to bring change.",
      "The 2011 Dilnot Commission plan for a cap on individual care costs came closest, making it into legislation, but was not implemented.",
      "It was finally scrapped by the new Labour government last summer because it said the last Conservative administration had not set aside the money to fund the reform.",
      "However, providing enough support for people in their own homes, care homes and supported living remains a pressing issue.",
      "The care systems in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are slightly more generous, but all are facing the pressures of growing demand and squeezed finances.",
      "The crisis in care: Who pays?",
      "The government had promised a National Care Service in its manifesto, although provided little detail.",
      "Streeting told the Today programme that, for him, the service is \"about national standards - consistent access to higher quality care for older and disabled people everywhere in the country\".",
      "The independent commission will work with users of care services, their families, staff, politicians and the public to recommend how best to build a care service to meet current and future needs.",
      "Melanie Williams, president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, said the \"timescales are too long\".",
      "She believes many options on how to reform adult social care are already known and worries that \"continuing to tread water until a commission concludes will be at the detriment of people's health and well-being\".",
      "The Conservatives welcomed the government's commission but urged ministers to reach a quicker conclusion.",
      "Edward Argar, the shadow health secretary, told the BBC's World At One said Streeting should \"be brave, be bold, be ambitious, speed up those discussions and try to get to a conclusion and a way forward before 2028\".",
      "Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said he was \"bewildered\" by the planned length of the commission and told broadcasters his party \"had expected that it could be done and dusted within a year\".",
      "About 835,000 people received publicly funded care in 2022, according to the King's Fund. The charity Age UK estimates there are about two million people in England who have unmet care needs - and according to workforce organisation Skills for Care, while 1.59 million people work in adult social care in England, there are currently 131,000 vacancies.",
      "Helen Walker, the head of Carers UK, which represents millions of unpaid people who provide care to family members, said families were \"under intense pressure and providing more care than ever before\".",
      "The government also confirmed an extra \u00a386m would be spent before the end of the financial year in April to help thousands more elderly and disabled people to remain in their homes.",

    "story": [
      "Welsh ambulance service chiefs have urged the public to \"drink sensibly\" at new year to help reduce demand on emergency services that suffered a 340-call backlog on Monday.",
      "Jason Killens, chief executive of Welsh Ambulance Service, made the plea after the service declared a critical incident.",
      "In addition, more than half of the trust's ambulance vehicles were waiting to hand over patients outside hospitals.",
      "Mr Killens asked the public to use the service \"wisely\" and only call during a \"genuine emergency\", and said it was prepared for the additional pressure and 999 calls.",
      "Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Mr Killens said there were delays at urgent and emergency care departments which prevented ambulance staff handing over patients.",
      "He said that one of the reasons for the pressure on the health system was down to winter viruses such as flu and Covid along with other factors.",
      "\"The pressure across the urgent and emergency care in the NHS is well documented. It's a challenge here in Wales as it is in the rest of the UK,\" he said.",
      "Mr Killens said other factors had also contributed to the pressures placed on the system.",
      "\"It's caused by many factors some associated with patients that are medically fit for discharge being unable to get back in to the communities because of the pressure in adult social care,\" he said.",
      "However, he added that while the pressure had continued overnight, the number of ambulances waiting was slightly less.",
      "\"As we go through this morning and we see the numbers of calls coming into us rising throughout the day as we normally would, we will see that similar situation of pressure arise today,\" he said.",
      "He apologised to patients waiting \"far too long\" but said there were plans in place to manage the backlog of calls.",
      "\"We do have doctors, nurses and paramedics providing advice over the phone and managing less serious patients in a different way so we can respond to those much more sick patients as quickly as we can,\" he said.",
      "Mr Killens also thanked the staff and volunteers for their work during the critical incident.",
      "On Monday, the Welsh Ambulance Service described the situation as \"very rare\".",

      "South Wales Fire and Rescue Service said it would support the ambulance service, urging people to call 999 \"for serious emergencies and where life is at risk\".",
      "\"With the pressure on the NHS and the yellow weather warning for Wales over the coming days, we expect demand for emergency services to be high,\" said Christian Hadfield, assistant chief fire officer.",

      "\"The increase in flu both in the community and across our hospital sites has resulted in several ward closures with 100 beds currently closed of which 10 are empty - we expect this to increase over the next few days,\" they said.",
      "A spokesman for Aneurin Bevan University Health Board said its services were facing the same extreme pressures being reported across Wales and the UK.",

    "story": [
      "James Hunt used to spend his days commuting to London, where he ran a successful marketing firm.",
      "But his children Jude and Tommy were diagnosed as autistic when they were toddlers, and he later decided to care for them and his parents full-time.",
      "James, from Burnham-on-Crouch in Essex, started blogging about their lives nine years ago and now has more than a million followers on social media.",
      "Here, in his own words, James speaks about his hopes for the future for his teenage sons.",
      "'It was the hardest period of my life'",
      "When my eldest son Jude was a baby, he was slow to crawl and didn't respond to his name. He used to stare out of the window, he was quite distant and almost in a different world.",
      "His mum Charlotte, my ex-wife, first raised concerns when he was eight months old but I just thought he was a bit behind because he was premature.",
      "We went back to the doctor quite a few times before we got an autism diagnosis in 2009 when he was 18 months old.",
      "At the time, the information out there was very clinical, most things we were reading were from the NHS website and medical journals. I felt like I couldn't take it in and I had so many unanswered questions.",
      "Three years later we went through the same diagnosis with Tommy at a similar age.",
      "I knew a lot more about autism than when we had Jude, but the boys have always been so different.",
      "I didn't enjoy the first year of Tommy's life as much as I could have done because I spent so much time watching him and looking for signs.",
      "He hit certain milestones much quicker than Jude but he wouldn't make eye contact and would get easily frustrated and enjoyed playing alone.",
      "Around the same time, when Jude was four, he started having huge meltdowns and was physically hurting himself.",
      "Jude is non-speaking, so it's very difficult for him to explain what's wrong. That was the hardest period of my life.",
      "He used to wake up in the night screaming and hitting himself. Thankfully as Jude has gotten older, and we've learnt more about how to meet his needs, this has got much better.",
      "'We decided to split the boys up'",
      "Unfortunately at the time Tommy was a huge trigger for him because he was loud and unpredictable. His self-harming would scare Tommy so we used to have to keep them apart a lot.",
      "In 2016, my wife Charlotte and I sadly decided to separate. We took the incredibly difficult decision to split Jude and Tommy up and we felt guilty, like we were failing.",
      "But Jude was immediately like a different child, you could sense his anxiety going, so we knew it was the right decision.",
      "I live in an annexe at my parents' house and help care for my dad who has Parkinson's and my mum, who has dementia, though she is now in a home.",
      "It's opposite my ex-wife's home and I have one of the boys for several nights a week and then we swap over, and I have the other one. They both need one-to-one care and it's impossible for them to live together.",
      "You never imagine life like that. I don't know if they will ever be able to live together but they will always be part of each other's lives.",
      "I wish I could be with both of them at the same time, and I don't get much free time, but this is the best thing for them right now. It has probably made being a single parent easier for me because I'm never alone.",
      "Their school is helping them to do more fun things together like trampolining and eating lunch together.",
      "'I've just had one of my best ever days with them'",
      "Jude is now 16 and loves music so we go on long car drives listening to the radio. It's one of the few places where he feels safe and can relax.",
      "There have been times he's been too anxious to do that and we were housebound but at the moment he's doing OK.",
      "Tommy is 13, and he is cheeky, mischievous, funny, and curious about everything around him. He loves looking at books and puzzles. He isn't fully verbal but he uses a communication device.",
      "I recently had one of the best days I've ever had with Jude and Tommy.",
      "In the past, when we have tried to do anything to celebrate Christmas, it has never gone well, it was too overwhelming for them. But we went to see Father Christmas and made such special memories.",
      "'I've connected with people from all over the world'",
      "Nine years ago I began sharing stories from our lives online, on a weekly blog. Then I started Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok accounts.",
      "It was initially a way to show friends and family what our life was really like. Jude and Tommy struggled with social occasions, so we stopped going.",
      "I could never find the words to explain, and I wanted to show how proud I was of them, so I started writing instead.",
      "I didn't realise how much our stories would resonate with others, or how much it would help me.",
      "I learned so much more about autism, connected with people all over the world and discovered a passion for helping other families.",
      "I've been lucky that I've been able to make a living through social media. I had to give up my previous job to be there for the boys.",
      "I started a clothing line last year, with positive messaging around autism, disabilities and neurodivergence. I love getting messages from people saying they have bumped into someone wearing one of the hoodies, and it started a conversation.",
      "I opened a shop in Burnham-on-Crouch where we stock the clothes and wrap and pack and send out the orders.",
      "It's somewhere for people in the community to visit, we have a sensory room in the shop and we get lots of parents coming in who want to have a chat.",
      "Everyone working in the shop is a parent, carer or is autistic, so they can share their experiences with customers.",
      "'I've learned to cherish the simple things'",
      "I always try to focus on the positives and not think too far ahead but there are days when my mind runs away with me.",
      "It will be a huge challenge when the boys leave school when they are 19.",
      "That's massively scary because suddenly you have to trust a whole new bunch of people.",
      "There is a part-time college I hope they can go to but it's a huge unknown and there will be big decisions to make.",
      "You feel like you have to live forever to look after them, and that is the biggest fear for many parents.",
      "Jude and Tommy will need life-long support, and I've started to realise I might not always be able to provide that for them.",
      "I don't know what the future will look like, but I know I need to think about how to help them live as independently as they can, and prepare for the days when I'm not here.",
      "Autism has meant we've had some of the highest highs, and experienced some lows far lower than I ever knew were imaginable.",
      "It has taught me to cherish and enjoy the simple things and I just want the boys to be happy.",
      "Looking back at how I felt when they were diagnosed, I would like to tell myself it's all going to be OK.",
      "Those first few years can be a really scary and emotional time. You feel like you have no idea what you're doing.",
      "Don't bottle everything up, find people to open up to. Your friends and family want to help, they just don't know how to yet.",
      "You will go through the most challenging and difficult days of your life but you will learn so much from your boys and your love for them will get you through.",

    "story": [
      "Nigel Farage has defended Elon Musk after the billionaire attacked the UK government's response to grooming gangs on X, the social media platform he owns.",
      "In a series of posts over several days, Musk suggested Sir Keir Starmer failed to prosecute gangs and said Home Office minister Jess Phillips \"deserves to be in prison\".",
      "It came as the Home Office defended its decision to reject a request for it to lead a public inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Oldham. The Conservatives and Reform UK have called for a wider national inquiry.",
      "Asked about Musk's comments on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Farage said he had used \"very tough terms\" but that \"free speech was back\" on X under his ownership.",
      "The Reform UK leader was also pressed on his wider relationship with Musk, who is said to be considering donating money to his party.",
      "Musk's latest intervention on UK politics came after Phillips, a safeguarding minister within the Home Office, instructed Oldham Council to launch its own local inquiry into historic child sexual abuse in the town, similar to inquiries set up in Rochdale and Telford. The local authority had called for a government-led inquiry.",
      "The tech tycoon seized on the decision, which was taken in October, and began heavily criticising the British government online.",
      "He suggested Sir Keir had failed to properly prosecute rape gangs while director of public prosecutions (DPP), and has repeatedly shared posts from Reform and Conservative MPs calling for a national inquiry.",
      "Musk, who is a key adviser to incoming US President Donald Trump, called the prime minister \"two-tier Keir\" and accused Phillips of being a \"rape genocide apologist\".",
      "On Saturday, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper defended Phillips as \"fearless and formidable\" and someone who has campaigned \"tirelessly for justice for those badly let down by endemic institutional failure\" for many years.",
      "Asked about the comments, Farage said Musk had used \"very tough terms\", but that \"in public life, tough things get said. They get said by both sides of the debate.\"",
      "Farage said he believed in free speech, \"even if what people say is offensive, if you find it offensive, if most people find it offensive\".",
      "He continued: \"This man happens to be the richest man in the world, but equally, the fact that he's bought Twitter now actually gives us a place where we can have a proper open debate about many things... We may find it offensive, but it's a good thing, not a bad thing.\"",
      "Earlier this week, Farage distanced himself from Musk's support for Tommy Robinson, a far-right activist who is serving a jail term for committing contempt of court.",
      "\"The fact that he supports me politically and supports Reform doesn't mean I have to agree with every single statement he makes on X,\" Farage told the programme.",
      "\"I will, at the inauguration, have a conversation with him on a variety of things \u2013 this will no doubt be one of them.\"",
      "In the interview, broadcast on BBC One on Sunday morning, Farage said the public is \"absolutely right to be\" angry about grooming gangs.",
      "He went on: \"I just think people ask themselves, what has happened to our country? How could this possibly have happened? Why did everybody want to cover it up? Why has there been no full public inquiry?\"",
      "In a letter seen by the BBC, Phillips and Cooper wrote to the Conservatives  setting out why they had asked Oldham Council to set up its own inquiry, rather than grant its request for a government-led one. The previous Conservative government turned down a similar request in 2022.",

    "summary": "With new financial backers and a rapidly growing base, Reform UK seems to have momentum, but will it last?",
    "story": [
      "Find yourself in a marquee on a Saturday afternoon where there's a bar with wine and beer, gags being cracked, and speeches being made and you might think it's a wedding.",
      "But the marquee at Chelmsford City Racecourse on Saturday was packed with more than 1,000 people who had turned up to a Reform UK rally, where the best man's speech and jokes were provided by the MP Lee Anderson, the crowd sang 'Here We Go' as he took the stage and the star turn who arrived to his own thumping sound track was Nigel Farage.",
      "The crowd seemed to be having fun, even though it is plain some of those gathered there have been drawn in because they are deeply disgruntled with the status quo in the UK.",
      "One grandfather told me he felt \"emotionally angry even talking to you and keeping my composure\", citing illegal immigration and the grooming scandal as the reason for his unhappiness.",
      "A newly joined party member said he was there because Farage \"is a breath of fresh air\" and current politicians were failing to give younger generations a chance to get on.",
      "And a Reform councillor from Suffolk said people were cross about the idea of pylons going everywhere as the government plans more green energy. They might have listed different reasons. But that obvious unhappiness is what seems to be driving the rapid growth of Reform UK.",
      "As if by magic, when Farage was on stage the party's membership passed 170,000, and two hours later the party told me they had added another 1,000.",
      "With new financial backers and a rapidly growing base, Reform UK does, at this moment, seem to have what they brag is the big momentum. Farage claims he's putting the party on the path to win the next election.",
      "The Reform leader has never been short on ambition \u2013 it goes far beyond his obvious desire to be a political celebrity, which he achieved long ago, and beyond the UK leaving the EU, in which his decades of agitating played a huge part.",
      "The mood in a packed room in Chelmsford made it clear Farage and his growing party reckon they can shake everything up.",
      "And he's not hanging around in 2025. He has made two big speeches over the past few days, is the first UK political leader of the year to appear on a public platform \u2013 and he'll be appearing on our Sunday programme this week.",
      "But how realistic is that ambition to win power \u2013 and when will we know whether Reform's growing support is here to stay?",
      "Tactics and controversy",
      "Since the election, Labour's sagging popularity and the Tories' doldrums have made space that Farage, and his four fellow Reform MPs, have stepped into. The party has used his tried and tested techniques, talking about issues in a way that other politicians just won't. He would say those politicians are too cautious or politically correct \u2013 they'd say they have a responsibility not to stir up tensions.",
      "I'll always remember intakes of breath around Westminster when he unveiled his poster depicting refugees on the continent and claiming immigration was at \"breaking point\" during the EU referendum in 2016. Some other Leave campaigners said it made them \"shudder\" and it was even reported to the police. But did it stir up a conversation about the EU that Farage wanted? It certainly did.",
      "Years later, now with a perch in Parliament, Mr Farage was met with howls of criticism when he questioned the police's assessment of what had gone on in the Southport attacks. His willingness to jump into controversy is part of the brand - and for his backers, part of the appeal.",
      "Trump and Musk",
      "Who'd know a thing or two about that? Enter Farage's two pals across the Atlantic \u2013 one of them, Donald Trump, will in two weeks again be the most powerful man in the Western world, and the other is a tech billionaire, Elon Musk.",
      "From the outside it's hard to tell how deep these friendships are \u2013 whether the Reform gang lurk on the fringes waiting to be invited for brief chats, or whether over time Musk and Trump will donate political fire power (or even cash through Musk's UK business).",
      "But without question, these unusual bromances give more oxygen to Reform UK, and for the leader of a small UK party to have a direct line to the White House and the richest man in the world is hard to ignore. Can you imagine Ed Davey hanging out with Jeff Bezos? Or John Swinney spending time with Mark Zuckerberg?",
      "Making headlines is not, of course, the same as getting people on side, and while these high-wattage friendships are a draw for some voters, they risk hurting Reform with others.",
      "Musk, who appears to have a fixation with the UK, on Friday accused PM Sir Keir Starmer of being complicit in the \"rape of Britain\" by not going after gangs grooming and abusing vulnerable young girls \u2013 it's hard to think of a more offensive charge, and Labour's Wes Streeting branded it \"misjudged and certainly misinformed\".",
      "Musk also suggested safeguarding minister Jess Phillips \"deserves to be in prison\" after she rejected a request for the Home Office to order a public inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Oldham. Phillips had said the council should commission a local inquiry instead, as happened in Rotherham and Telford. In a further post on X on Saturday, Musk said \"what an evil human\" in response to a video showing a previous appearance by Phillips on Question Time.",
      "And in the last couple of days Musk has been tweeting support for right-wing activist Tommy Robinson, a man with criminal convictions who Nigel Farage tried incredibly hard to distance himself from. Farage described Musk as a \"hero\" for buying Twitter, but conceded he has \"a whole range of opinions, some of which I agree with very strongly, and others of which I am more reticent about\".",
      "Cash and growth",
      "So Farage has new friends and new energy \u2013 and what has also changed since the election is Reform's potentially bulging bank balance.",
      "Whether you like it or not, money matters in politics. It's needed to pay for a lot of the unglamorous but vital work, such as hiring political organisers, opening local branches, and managing Farage's burgeoning social media accounts. Since the recruitment of Nick Candy, a billionaire and former Conservative donor, as the party's new treasurer, Farage has an ally who can write big cheques to support all that \u2013 he has promised to give Reform a seven-figure sum.",
      "The latest recorded donation figures show donations of only \u00a370,000 for the third quarter of 2024, but that seems set to change. The party's website is advertising jobs, and Reform is putting on regular events and building its membership around the country, which it says is now bigger than the Conservatives' rank and file.",
      "Over the next week Farage is appearing in Leicester, Chelmsford, Esher, and Chester. The party is yet to make a huge amount of noise in the Commons with their tiny band of MPs, but their whole persona is to do politics in a new way, outside Parliament.",
      "As they grow, so too will the scrutiny they face.",
      "There is likely to be more checking back over what they branded their \"contract with the people\" in the general election. They promised to cut \u00a35 out of every \u00a3100 in government spending within a hundred days, end shortages of doctors and nurses over the same time and give tax breaks to anyone who wanted to pay to go private in the NHS. They promised a freeze on non-essential immigration, more police, big changes to education, massive changes to the benefit system, and cutting tax while increasing spending on defence.",
      "To some voters their plans might sound like an appealing pick and mix, but there are big questions over whether many of the plans are remotely workable.",
      "And it's not just their policies they need people to get behind \u2013 it's their personnel, too. In the general election, as we revealed, candidates who wanted to stand for the party had expressed offensive views Reform found hard to defend. As they seek to expand, have they come up with a cast of characters the general public could get behind?",
      "Success - a distant prospect?",
      "Voters attracted to Reform don't come from any one political tribe, but ask pollsters and they share a sentiment \u2013 they're pretty peeved with the UK in 2025.",
      "Luke Tryl from the research group More In Common says the party has prospered because of dissatisfaction with the Conservatives and disappointment with the early signs from Labour.",
      "He says their ratings have bumped up from around 15 to 20% thanks to people who previously would have said they liked Farage but were worried about him as PM, but are now saying, \"well we've tried the Tories they didn't work, Labour have taken away my mum's winter fuel allowance, so we may as well try Reform\".",
      "Their current polling suggests they could, theoretically, nab dozens of seats from Labour, although their actual backers are mainly former Conservative voters - and a general election is years away.",
      "And unlike the other main political parties the chance someone would vote Reform does not change that much on the age you are. Their average voter is a Gen X man \u2013 born between the mid-sixties and 1980. It's only among older pensioners that research suggests the level of support falls away. The pattern doesn't seem to follow the clich\u00e9 that parties on the right grab elderly traditional 'small c' conservatives.",
      "In other words, the environment is ripe for Farage to thrive. But as his own political career demonstrates very vividly, political fashions come and go.",
      "Labour hopes desperately that doing the hard yards will pay off, restore their popularity, and they will be able to improve the country in at least some of the ways they promised you back in July. The Conservatives fervently hope that before too long their new leader Badenoch can make some progress.",
      "In 2025, the public will decide whether the party continues its march - or mucks up the opportunity it has. There will be tests during important elections in Wales, and contests for local mayors and local councils in May.",
      "A senior government figure told me \"we shouldn't over think\" the threat from Reform. But not to think hard about the party could prove foolish indeed.",
      "Farage's dream of a general election victory is years away and politically distant too. But he hopes in 2025 to prove that by the end of this year, it's an ambition that will look less far-fetched.",

      "An investigation in Telford found that up to 1,000 girls had been abused over 40 years - and that some cases had not been investigated because of \"nervousness about race\".",

      "The Independent Inquiry into Child Sex Abuse (IICSA), which published its final report in 2022, knitted several of these inquiries together alongside its own investigations.",
      "Professor Alexis Jay, who led the inquiry, said in November she felt \"frustrated\" that none of its 20 recommendations to tackle abuse had been implemented more than two years later.",

      "Asked why the Tory government had not conducted a national public inquiry into such gangs, Philp pointed to IICSA but added \"I don't think it was, frankly, as comprehensive on this topic as it should have been\".",
      "Philp said: \"We need a proper national inquiry to look at all of these issues across all of the towns affected. And I'm afraid to say there are something like 15 to 25 different towns involved, covering thousands and thousands of victims.\"",
      "Questions about the conduct of local authorities, the police and social care needed answering on a national scale, he argued. Philp also did not rule out the inquiry looking at the role of Sir Keir Starmer, who was director of public prosecutions from 2008 to 2013.",
      "He said an inquiry should examine why perpetrators in \"grooming gangs and rape gangs\" appeared to be \"overwhelmingly of South Asian background\".",

      "In July, Oldham Council, which is led by a Labour minority administration, asked the Home Office to lead a fuller inquiry into historical abuse in the area.",
      "Phillips rejected the request, pointing to council-run inquiries in Rotherham and Telford, which she argued had greater legitimacy because they were locally commissioned and delivered.",
      "In a letter to the council, the safeguarding minister said she recognised the \"strength of feeling\" but believed it was \"for Oldham Council alone to decide to commission an inquiry into child sexual exploitation locally, rather than for the Government to intervene\".",

    "story": [
      "Senior ministers urged the then-Prime Minister Tony Blair to delay granting employment rights to eastern and central European workers when the EU expanded in 2004, newly released files have revealed.",
      "In February that year, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw pointed out that Britain was alone amongst the bigger EU members in offering a \"concession\".",
      "The concession meant people from Poland and other newly joined EU countries would be able to work in Britain after 1 May.",
      "Almost all the other large states would not allow this for two years: only Italy was undecided. Smaller EU countries, aside from Ireland, had work permit schemes which would limit numbers.",
      "Papers from the National Archives - which have been released now they are 20 years old - show Straw proposed a six-month delay for the UK.",
      "He said: \"I believe we could be faced with a very difficult situation in early May\".",
      "He warned the UK could \"be forced to revoke the concession in the least propitious of circumstances\".",
      "His letter was copied to other senior ministers, and the then-deputy prime minister John Prescott supported Straw.",
      "Prescott wrote that he was \"extremely concerned\" about the potential impact on social housing.",
      "He was also worried that many workers would come to London and the South East, and unable to find decent housing would \"resort to sharing overcrowded housing in poor conditions\".",
      "But David Blunkett, the then-home secretary, argued the economy needed the \"flexibility and productivity\" these new workers could provide.",
      "Eight eastern and central European countries joined the EU in 2004, including Poland. According to the government, the number of Polish nationals living in the UK increased from around 69,000 to around 853,000 over the next decade.",
      "Blair asked whether the UK could have work permits, but instead the Home Office speedily drew up a \"workers registration scheme\".",
      "That scheme required A8 workers - those from the eight new member states - to pay a fee and register their employment in a specific job. Failing to do so would incur a significant fine.",
      "From May 2004 onwards, No 10 monitored these registration numbers week by week.",
      "The government was particularly worried because it had publicly estimated that only 13,000 new workers a year would come to Britain after the EU expanded.",
      "The files show that Kate Gross, one of the private secretaries at No 10, wrote to the prime minister on 2 July 2004.",
      "She enclosed a briefing note for the press which would say \"the influx of new arrivals predicted by the media simply hasn't arrived\", even though that 13,000 had been exceeded.",
      "She explained that while 24,000 people had registered with the scheme, most had been living in the UK before 1 May.",
      "Kate Gross's memo notes that most were young, aged 18-34 - and there was no evidence of them \"exploiting the benefits system\". Blair scrawled \"that is the key\" by the side of that statement.",
      "However Kate Gross noted \"the key elephant trap is how these figures relate to previous HO [Home Office] projections\".",
      "If applications continued to increase, she wrote, the number of new arrivals would hit \"50-60,000 by May 2005\".",
      "The next set of figures for the scheme showed a drop, and a briefing paper to No 10 said: \"It looks like we are over the peak in applications.\"",
      "The Immigration and Nationality Directorate \"should be congratulated on implementing the workers registration scheme in short order\", it said.",
      "The problem was, the scheme wasn't providing an accurate record.",
      "The self-employed did not have to register, for example, which excluded many building workers like carpenters.",
      "And there was little enforcement.",
      "The shortcomings of the workers registration scheme were exposed in late 2005, when according to the WRS there were only 95 Polish plumbers in the whole of the  UK.",
      "In 24 hours the Daily Mail found 95 Polish plumbers in London alone.",
      "Over the next few years hundreds of thousands of A8 nationals, mostly Polish, moved to the UK.",

      "The names of visitors to No 10 are not made public so the books provide a valuable record of who had private conversations with prime ministers.",

      "Just a year later, Amin expelled tens of thousands of Ugandan Asians, giving them only 90 days to leave the country. Many held British passports and came to settle in the UK.",
      "Among the world leaders - including Jimmy Carter, Ferdinand Marcos and Indira Gandhi - is an anomaly, four pages packed with signatures of well-known British women of 1978 - Anna Ford, Cleo Laine, Prue Leith and Janet Street-Porter.",
      "The latter was a well-known face on TV, but Janet Street-Porter remembers being intimidated by the event, a reception to mark 50 years of equal suffrage.",

      "While there were many receptions in Downing Street, the book was brought out for very few \u2013 including to commemorate the 250th anniversary of Downing Street in 1985.",
      "The Queen and Prince Philip signed, as did six other prime ministers, including the increasingly frail Harold Macmillan, Lord Stockton.",
      "The book captures the changing times: President Mikhail Gorbachev signed in April 1989, when he came for a state visit with his wife, Raisa.",
      "Early the following year, the leaders of the newly independent Eastern European countries visited No 10 - including Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia, who added his trademark little heart.",

    "summary": "Politicians are navigating how to deal with the social media presence of Donald Trump and Elon Musk.",
    "story": [
      "In Donald Trump's first term, governments around the world braced for his morning social media posts. What policy would be reversed, what insult thrown? Four years on, diplomats are once more getting twitchy when the sun rises on America's east coast.",
      "Back then, they learned to take Trump - as the adage had it - \"seriously but not literally\". Despite many campaign promises, he did not take the US out of Nato or lock up Hilary Clinton. But can ministers stay so sanguine a second time around?",
      "Trump's latest morning salvo criticised the UK government's decision to increase taxes on oil and gas firms working in the North Sea, in part to help fund renewable energy.",
      "On his platform, Truth Social, Trump responded to a report about a US oil firm leaving the region, saying: \"The U.K. is making a very big mistake. Open up the North Sea. Get rid of Windmills!\"",
      "Was this merely a familiar defence of a US firm by Trump and a repetition of his pro-fossil fuel instincts? Or was it evidence of a greater willingness by the president-elect to intervene in an ally's own domestic policies?",
      "The main difference - four years on - is that Trump is no longer alone at the keyboard; his increasingly powerful fellow traveller, Elon Musk, is even more prolific, using his own platform, X, to attack the British government across the board. He has criticised its handling of last summer's riots, the running of the economy and now especially its attitude towards child abuse scandals.",
      "Musk has issued a torrent of tweets attacking Sir Keir Starmer personally, accusing the prime minister of not doing enough to prosecute child grooming gangs while he was the director of public prosecutions.",
      "British politicians cannot stem these posts from across the Atlantic. But they can control their reaction. During Trump's first term, governments - and news desks - learned to pause and take a moment before responding to - or reporting - the latest electronic missives from the White House.",
      "Thus far the Conservatives have chosen to engage with and echo Musk's agenda. The party leader, Kemi Badenoch, said a full national inquiry into organised grooming gangs was \"long overdue\".",
      "But the Conservatives balked at Musk's apparent support for the jailed far-right activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson.",
      "Musk has shared several posts on X calling for the release of Yaxley-Lennon, who was jailed in October after admitting contempt of court by repeating false claims against a Syrian refugee.",
      "Alicia Kearns, the Conservative shadow safeguarding minister, said it was \"frankly dangerous\" of Musk to be \"lionising people like Tommy Robinson\".",
      "As for Labour, it seems keen to avoid picking a fight with one of the world's richest men who could one day fund a rival political party. Nigel Farage's Reform Party has said Musk is among \"a number of billionaires\" interested in donating money for their campaigns.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting said Musk's comments about child grooming scandals were \"misjudged and certainly misinformed\" but asked the billionaire to work with the UK government to tackle online child abuse.",
      "UK politicians are not alone in being the target of Musk's increasingly eccentric interventions. He has described Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany as a \"fool\" and the country's head of state, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, as \"an anti-democratic tyrant\". He has also called Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada \"an insufferable tool\" who \"won't be in power for much longer\".",
      "Monitoring closely",
      "So the challenge once again for politicians in Britain and around the world is to work out which, if any, of these social media outbursts and interventions merit a response.",
      "In Whitehall, there is some hope the arrival of Lord Mandelson as the new British ambassador might help stem the flow of personal vituperation across the Atlantic.",
      "There is also weight being placed on Trump's affection for the UK and the Royal Family; he had a good meeting with the Prince of Wales in Paris in December after the opening of Notre Dame.",
      "Other officials are even musing that the relationship between Trump and Musk might prove too combustible in office.",

      "What is VAT and when was it added to private school fees?",
      "Value added tax (VAT) is one of the government's main sources of income. It is payable on top of the purchase price of many goods or services and the standard rate is 20%.",
      "Previously, private schools did not have to charge VAT on their fees because of an exemption for organisations providing education.",

      "Separate legislation will be introduced to remove this tax relief from April 2025, but plans to remove private schools' charitable status have been dropped.",
      "How will the extra money be spent?",
      "The removal of the VAT exemption is UK-wide, but each nation will decide how to spend the additional money received.",

      "Labour has repeatedly pledged to use the money to recruit 6,500 new teachers for state schools in England.",
      "Schools have been struggling to attract and retain qualified teachers for years, especially in subject areas like maths and science.",
      "In October's Budget, the government allocated different sources of funding to address other issues in schools, like crumbling buildings and a stretched system for pupils with special educational needs.",
      "How much do private schools cost?",
      "Private schools - sometimes called independent schools - charge fees for most students.",

      "Do 'many' private schools cost the same as a family holiday?",
      "Will private school fees go up for everyone?",
      "Applying VAT does not necessarily mean fees will go up by 20%. Some private schools may decide to put up their fees more than others.",
      "On average, the government expects fees to increase by around 10%.",
      "The average cost of private school fees has risen by 55% since 2003, even without VAT, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tanks says.",
      "However, the proportion of children being privately educated over the period has not fallen.",

      "The government says a grant to help cover boarding-school fees for children of military families is being increased to take account of rising charges.",
      "What could the tax change mean for state schools?",
      "The government does not expect a significant impact on the number of pupils attending private schools.",
      "It estimates that around 37,000 students will move to the state sector over the long term, but believes class sizes will not increase.",
      "It points to research by the IFS which says it would be possible for the state sector to \"easily accommodate extra pupils\" because overall student numbers are set to fall by 700,000 by 2030.",
      "That drop is larger than the total number of children currently attending private schools.",
      "However, pupil numbers are not falling by the same amount everywhere, so some individual state schools could face pressure on class sizes.",
      "The Independent Schools Council (ISC), which represents more than 1,400 private schools, says some of its members reported a 4.6% fall in Year 7 pupils in September 2024.",
      "The ISC believes the government has underestimated the level of pupil displacement that will be caused.",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 01:01:03 GMT",
    "summary": "The Northern Territory is home to over 100,000 saltwater crocodiles, but not everyone wants them there.",
    "story": [
      "It's dawn on Darwin Harbour and government ranger Kelly Ewin - whose job is to catch and remove crocodiles - is balancing precariously on a floating trap.",
      "Heavy rain clouds from the storm that has recently passed are overhead. The engine of the boat has been cut so now it's mostly silent \u2013 that is, apart from the intermittent splashing coming from inside the trap.",
      "\"You get pretty much zero chances with these guys,\" says Ewin as he attempts to loop a noose around the jaw of the agitated reptile.",
      "We're in Australia's Northern Territory (NT), home to an estimated 100,000 wild saltwater crocodiles, more than anywhere in the world.",
      "The capital, Darwin, is a small coastal city surrounded by beaches and wetlands.",
      "And, as you quickly learn here in the NT, where there is water, there usually are crocs.",
      "Saltwater crocs - or salties, as they are known to locals - were nearly hunted to extinction 50 years ago.",
      "After World War Two, the uncontrolled trade in their skins soared and numbers fell to around 3,000.",
      "But when hunting was banned in 1971, the population started rising again - and fast.",
      "They still are a protected species, but are no longer threatened.",
      "The recovery of the saltwater crocodile has been so dramatic that Australia now faces a different dilemma: managing their numbers to keep people safe and the public onside.",
      "\"The worst thing that can happen is when people turn [against crocodiles],\" explains croc expert Prof Grahame Webb.",
      "\"And then a politician will invariably come along with some knee-jerk reaction [that] they're going to 'solve' the crocodile problem.\"",
      "Living with predators",
      "The NT's hot temperatures and abundant coastal surroundings create the perfect habitat for cold-blooded crocs, who need warmth to keep their body temperature constant.",
      "There also are big saltie populations in Northern Queensland and Western Australia as well as in parts of South East Asia.",
      "While most species of crocodile are harmless, the saltie is territorial and aggressive.",
      "Fatal incidents are rare in Australia, but they do happen.",
      "Last year, a 12-year-old was taken - the first death from a crocodile in the NT since 2018.",
      "'Hero' father killed in crocodile attack",
      "Body found in search for child missing in croc attack",
      "This is busiest time of year for Ewin and his colleagues.",
      "Breeding season has just started, which means salties are on the move.",
      "His team are on the water several times a week, checking the 24 crocodile traps surrounding the city of Darwin.",
      "The area is popular for fishing, as well as for some brave swimmers.",
      "The crocodiles that are removed from the harbour are most often killed, because if they are released elsewhere, they're likely to return to the harbour.",
      "\"It's our job to try and keep people as safe as we can,\" says Ewin, who's been doing his \"dream job\" for two years. Before that, he was a policeman.",
      "\"Obviously, we're not going to capture every crocodile, but the more we take out of the harbour, the less risk there's going to be an encounter with crocodiles and people.\"",
      "Another tool helping to keep the public safe is education.",
      "The NT government goes into schools with its programme \"Be Crocwise\" - which teaches people how to behave responsibly around croc habitats.",
      "It's been such a success that Florida and the Philippines are now looking to borrow it, in order to better understand how the world's most dangerous predators can live alongside humans with minimal interactions.",
      "\"We're living in crocodile country, so it's about how we [keep ourselves] safe around the waterways - how should we be responding?\" says Natasha Hoffman, a ranger who runs the programme in the NT.",
      "\"If you're on the boats when you're fishing, you need to be aware that they're there. They're ambush hunters, they sit, watch and wait. If the opportunity is there for them to grab some food, that's what they're going to do.\"",
      "In the NT, mass culling is currently not on the table given the protected status of the species.",
      "Last year though, the government approved a new 10-year crocodile management plan to help control the numbers, which increased the quota of crocs that can be killed annually from 300 to 1,200.",
      "This is on top of the work Ewin's team is doing to remove any crocodiles that pose a direct threat to humans.",
      "Every time there's a death, it reignites the debate about crocodiles living in close proximity to people.",
      "In the days after the 12-year-old girl was taken last year, the Territory's then leader Eva Lawler made it clear she wouldn't allow the reptiles to outnumber the human population of the NT.",
      "Currently that stands at 250,000, well above the number of wild crocs.",
      "It's a conversation that goes beyond the NT.",
      "Queensland is home to about a quarter of the number of crocs that the Top End of NT has, but there are far more tourists, and more deaths, which means talk of culls sometimes feature in election debates.",
      "Big business",
      "The apex predators may court controversy, but they're also a big draw card for the NT \u2013 for tourists but also for fashion brands keen to buy their leather.",
      "Visitors can head to the Adelaide River to watch \"croc jumping\" -  which involves salties being fed bits of meat on the end of a stick if they can leap out of the water for their audience.",
      "\"I'm supposed to tell you to put your [life-jackets] on,\" jokes the head skipper at Spectacular Jumping Croc Cruises, Alex 'Wookie' Williams, as he explains the house rules of the boat.",
      "\"The bit I don't have to tell you\u2026 [is that] life jackets are pretty useless out here.\"",
      "For Williams, who's been obsessed with crocs since childhood, there's plenty of opportunity to work alongside them.",
      "\"It's boomed over the last 10 years or so,\" he says of the number of tourists coming to the region.",
      "Farming, which was brought in when hunting was banned, has also become an economic driver.",
      "It's estimated there are now about 150,000 crocodiles in captivity in the NT.",
      "Fashion labels such as Louis Vuitton and Herm\u00e8s - which sells a Birkin 35 croc handbag for as much as A$800,000 ($500,000; \u00a3398,000) - have all invested in the industry.",
      "\"The commercial incentives were effectively put in place to help people tolerate crocodiles, because we need a social licence to be able to use wildlife,\" says Mick Burns, one of the NT's most prominent farmers who works with luxury brands.",
      "His office is in downtown Darwin. Spread across the floor is a massive croc skin. Pinned to the wall of the conference room, there is another skin that spans at least four metres.",
      "Burns is also involved with a ranch in remote Arnhem Land, about 500km (310 miles) east of Darwin. There, he works with Aboriginal rangers to harvest and hatch croc eggs to sell their skins to the luxury goods industry.",
      "One of the area's Traditional Owners, Otto Bulmaniya Campion, who works alongside Burns, says more partnerships like theirs are crucial for ensuring Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities share in the financial benefits of the industry.",
      "For tens of thousands of years, crocs have played a significant role in Indigenous cultures, shaping their sacred stories, lives and livelihoods.",
      "\"My father, all the elders, used to go and harpoon crocodiles, get a skin, and go and trade it for tea, flour, and sugar. [However] there was no money at that time,\" the  Balngarra man says.",
      "\"Now, we want to see our own people handling reptiles.\"",
      "But not everyone is on board with farming as a practice - even if those involved say it helps with conservation.",
      "The concern among animal activists lies in the way the crocs are held in captivity.",
      "Despite being social animals, they are usually confined to individual pens to ensure their skins are flawless - as a scrap between two territorial crocs would almost certainly damage a valuable commodity.",
      "Everyone in Darwin has a story about these formidable creatures, regardless of whether they want to see them hunted in greater numbers or more rigorously preserved.",
      "But the threat they continue to pose is not imagined.",
      "\"If you go [swimming in] the Adelaide river next to Darwin, there's a 100% chance you'll be killed,\" says Prof Webb matter-of-factly.",
      "\"The only question is whether it's going to take five minutes or 10 minutes. I don't think you'll ever get to 15 - you'll be torn apart,\" he adds, pushing up his trouser leg to reveal a huge scar on his calf - evidence of a close encounter with one angry female nearly forty years ago as he was collecting eggs.",
      "He is unapologetic about what he calls the pragmatism of authorities to manage numbers and make money out of crocs along the way - a way of life that, in the near future at least, is here to stay.",
      "\"We've done what very few people can do, which is take a very serious predator\u2026and then manage them in such a way that the public is prepared to [tolerate] them.",
      "\"You try and get people in Sydney or London or New York to put up with a serious predator - they aren't going to do it.\"",

    "summary": "About 200 footprints made by dinosaurs 166 million years ago have been unearthed in a quarry in Oxfordshire.",
    "story": [
      "The UK's biggest ever dinosaur trackway site has been discovered in a quarry in Oxfordshire.",
      "About 200 huge footprints, which were made 166 million years ago, criss-cross the limestone floor.",
      "They reveal the comings and goings of two different types of dinosaurs that are thought to be a long-necked sauropod called Cetiosaurus and the smaller meat-eating Megalosaurus.",
      "The longest trackways are 150m in length, but they could extend much further as only part of the quarry has been excavated.",
      "\"This is one of the most impressive track sites I've ever seen, in terms of scale, in terms of the size of the tracks,\" said Prof Kirsty Edgar, a micropalaeontologist from the University of Birmingham.",
      "\"You can step back in time and get an idea of what it would have been like, these massive creatures just roaming around, going about their own business.\"",
      "The tracks were first spotted by Gary Johnson, a worker at Dewars Farm Quarry, while he was driving a digger.",
      "\"I was basically clearing the clay, and I hit a hump, and I thought it's just an abnormality in the ground,\" he said, pointing to a ridge where some mud has been pushed up as a dinosaur's foot pressed down into the earth.",
      "\"But then it got to another, 3m along, and it was a hump again. And then it went another 3m - hump again.\"",
      "Another trackway site had been found nearby in the 1990s, so he realised the regular bumps and dips could be dinosaur footprints.",
      "\"I thought I'm the first person to see them. And it was so surreal - a bit of a tingling moment, really,\" he told BBC News.",
      "This summer, more than 100 scientists, students and volunteers joined an excavation at the quarry which features on the new series of Digging for Britain.",
      "The team found five different trackways.",
      "Four of them were made by sauropods, plant-eating dinosaurs that walked on four legs. Their footprints look a bit like an elephant's - only much much bigger - these beasts reached up to 18m in length.",
      "Another track is thought to have been created by a Megalosaurus.",
      "\"It's almost like a caricature of a dinosaur footprint\", explained Dr Emma Nicholls, a vertebrate palaeontologist from the Oxford University Museum of Natural History.",
      "\"It's what we call a tridactyl print. It's got these three toes that are very, very clear in the print.\"",
      "The carnivorous creatures, which walked on two legs, were agile hunters, she said.",
      "\"The whole animal would have been 6-9m in length. They were the largest predatory dinosaurs that we know of in the Jurassic period in Britain.\"",
      "The environment they lived in was covered by a warm, shallow lagoon and the dinosaurs left their prints as they ambled across the mud.",
      "\"Something must have happened to preserve these in the fossil record,\" said Prof Richard Butler, a palaeobiologist from the University of Birmingham.",
      "\"We don't know exactly what, but it might be that there was a storm event that came in, deposited a load of sediments on top of the footprints, and meant that they were preserved rather than just being washed away.\"",
      "The team studied the trackways in detail during the dig. As well as making casts of the tracks, they took more than 20,000 photographs to create 3D models of both the complete site and individual footprints.",
      "\"The really lovely thing about a dinosaur footprint, particularly if you have a trackway, is that it is a snapshot in the life of the animal,\" Prof Butler explained.",
      "\"You can learn things about how that animal moved. You can learn exactly what the environment that it was living in was like. So tracks give us a whole different set of information that you can't get from the bone fossil record.\"",
      "One area of the site even reveals where the paths of a sauropod and megalosaurus once crossed.",
      "The prints are so beautifully preserved that the team have been able to work out which animal passed through first - they believe it was the sauropod, because the front edge of its large, round footprint is slightly squashed down by the three-toed megalosaurus walking on top of it.",
      "\"Knowing that this one individual dinosaur walked across this surface and left exactly that print is so exhilarating,\" said Dr Duncan Murdock from Oxford University.",
      "\"You can sort of imagine it making its way through, pulling its legs out of the mud as it was going.\"",
      "The future fate of the trackways hasn't yet been decided but the scientists are working with Smiths Bletchington, who operate the quarry, and Natural England on options for preserving the site for the future.",
      "They believe there could be more footprints, these echoes of our prehistoric past, just waiting to be discovered.",
      "The excavation is featured on Digging for Britain  on BBC Two at 20:00 on Wednesday 8 January. The full series will be available on BBC iPlayer on 7 January."

    "summary": "Researchers say new DNA research could shed new light on what history books say about ancient Britain.",
    "story": [
      "From the end of the Roman occupation through the Anglo-Saxon and Viking invasions - a new way of testing DNA in ancient bones could force a rethink of key moments in Britain's early history, say researchers.",
      "Scientists could already track big alterations in DNA that occur over thousands or millions of years, helping us learn, for example, how early humans evolved from ape-like creatures.",
      "Now researchers can identify subtler changes over just hundreds of years, providing clues as to how people migrated and interacted with locals.",
      "They are using the new method to analyse human remains found in Britain, including from the time when Romans were replaced by an Anglo-Saxon elite from Europe.",
      "Prof Peter Heather, from Kings College London, who is working on the project with the developers of the new DNA technique at the Francis Crick Institute in London, said the new technique could be \"revolutionary\".",
      "While the project will analyse the DNA of more than 1,000 ancient human remains of people who lived in Britain during the past 4,500 years, researchers have homed in on the time after the Romans left as a particularly interesting era to study.",
      "What happened in this period more than 1,500 years ago is unclear from written and archeological records. Historians are divided in their views about the scale and nature of the Anglo-Saxon invasion, whether it was large or small, hostile or co-operative.",
      "\"It is one of the most contested and therefore one of the most exciting things to work on in the whole of British history,\" according to Prof Heather.",
      "\"[The new method] will allow us to see the type of relations that are being found with the native population,\" he said. \"Are they co-operative, is there interbreeding, are the locals able to make their way into the elite?\"",
      "Humans may not have survived without Neanderthals",
      "They are optimistic about the success of the technique, known as Twigstats, after testing it on human remains found in mainland Europe between the years 1 and 1,000 CE.",
      "Much of what they gleaned from the DNA about the spread of the Vikings into Scandinavia tallied with historical records.",
      "This result, published in the journal Nature, confirmed the method worked while showing how powerful it could be at shedding new light on accepted facts when findings didn't match what was written in the history books.",
      "\"That was the moment we got really excited,\" said Dr Leo Speidel, who developed the technique with his group leader Dr Pontus Skoglund. \"We could see that this could really change how much we can find out about human history.\"",
      "The problem the researchers were trying to overcome is that a human's genetic code is extremely long - consisting of 3 billion separate chemical units.",
      "Spotting the small genetic changes in that code which occur over a few generations, for example, as a result of new arrivals interbreeding with the local population, is like looking for a needle in a haystack.",
      "The researchers solved the problem by, as it were, taking away the haystack and leaving the needle in plain sight - they found a way to identify the older genetic changes, disregard them and look only at the most recent alterations.",
      "They combed the genetic data of thousands of human remains from an online scientific database, then calculated how closely they were related to each other, which chunks of DNA were inherited from which groups and when.",
      "This created a family tree with older changes appearing in earlier branches, and more recent changes showing up in newer 'twigs', hence the name Twigstats.",
      "Each of the people whose remains will be studied have their own tales to tell and soon scientists and historians will be able to hear their stories, said Dr Skoglund.",
      "\"We want to understand many different epochs in European and British history, from the Roman period, when the Anglo-Saxons arrived, through the Viking period and see how this shapes the ancestry and diversity of this part of the World,\" he said.",
      "As well as showing up interbreeding with different populations, embedded in the ancient DNA are hugely important details on how people coped with key historical moments, such epidemics, shifts in diet, urbanisation, and industrialisation.",
      "The technique can potentially be applied to any part of the world for which there are a large collection of well preserved human remains.",
      "Prof Heather wants to use it to investigate what he describes as one of European history's biggest mysteries: why central and eastern Europe changed from being Germanic speaking to Slavic speaking, 1,500 years ago.",
      "\"Historical sources show what was the case before and what was the case after, but there is nothing about what happened in between,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "On Christmas Eve, an autonomous spacecraft flew past the Sun, closer than any human-made object before it. Swooping through the atmosphere, Nasa's Parker Solar Probe was on a mission to discover more about the Sun, including how it affects space weather on Earth.",
      "This was a landmark moment for humanity \u2013 but one without any human directly involved, as the spacecraft carried out its pre-programmed tasks by itself as it flew past the sun, with no communication with Earth at all.",
      "Robotic probes have been sent across the solar system for the last six decades, reaching destinations impossible for humans. During its 10-day flyby, the Parker Solar Probe experienced temperatures of 1000C.",
      "But the success of these autonomous spacecraft \u2013 coupled with the rise of new advanced artificial intelligence \u2013 raises the question of what role humans might play in future space exploration.",
      "Some scientists question whether human astronauts are going to be needed at all.",
      "\"Robots are developing fast, and the case for sending humans is getting weaker all the time,\" says Lord Martin Rees, the UK's Astronomer Royal. \"I don't think any taxpayer's money should be used to send humans into space.\"",
      "He also points to the risk to humans.",
      "\"The only case for sending humans [there] is as an adventure, an experience for wealthy people, and that should be funded privately,\" he argues.",
      "Andrew Coates, a physicist from University College London, agrees. \"For serious space exploration, I much prefer robotics,\" he says. \"[They] go much further and do more things.\"",
      "They are also cheaper than humans, he argues. \"And as AI progresses, the robots can be cleverer and cleverer.\"",
      "But what does that mean for future generations of budding astronauts \u2013 and surely there are certain functions that humans can do in space but which robots, however advanced, never could?",
      "Rovers versus mankind",
      "Robotic spacecraft have visited every planet in the solar system, as well as many asteroids and comets, but humans have only gone to two destinations: Earth's orbit and the Moon.",
      "In all, about 700 people have been to space, since the earliest in 1961, when Yuri Gagarin from the then-Soviet Union became the first cosmic explorer. Most of those have been into orbit (circling the Earth) or suborbit (short vertical hops into space lasting minutes, on vehicles like the US company Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket).",
      "\"Prestige will always be a reason that we have humans in space,\" says Dr Kelly Weinersmith, a biologist at Rice University, Texas and co-author of A City on Mars. \"It seems to have been agreed upon as a great way to show that your political system is effective and your people are brilliant.\"",
      "But aside from an innate desire to explore, or a sense of prestige, humans also carry out research and experiments in Earth's orbit, such as on the International Space Station, and use these to advance science.",
      "Robots can contribute to that scientific research, with the ability to travel to locations inhospitable to humans, where they can use instruments to study and probe the atmospheres and surfaces.",
      "\"Humans are more versatile and we get stuff done faster than a robot, but we're really hard and expensive to keep alive in space,\" says Dr Weinersmith.",
      "In her 2024 Booker Prize-winning novel Orbital, author Samantha Harvey puts it more lyrically: \"A robot has no need for hydration, nutrients, excretion, sleep\u2026 It wants and asks for nothing.\"",
      "But there are downsides. Many robots are slow and methodical \u2013 for example on Mars, the rovers (remote-controlled motor vehicles) trundle along at barely 0.1mph.",
      "\"AI can beat human beings at chess, but does that mean they'll be able to beat human beings in exploring environments?\" asks Dr Ian Crawford, a planetary scientist at the University of London. \"I just don't think we know.\"",

      "\"[AI could be used to] automate tedious tasks,\" explains Dr Kiri Wagstaff, a computer and planetary scientist in the US who previously worked at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. \"On the surface of a planet, humans get tired and lose focus, but machines won't.\"",
      "The challenge is that vast amounts of power are needed to operate systems like large language models (LLM), which can understand and generate human language by processing vast amounts of text data. \"We are not at the point of being able to run an LLM on a Mars rover,\" says Dr Wagstaff.",
      "\"The rovers' processors run at about a tenth [of the speed] that your smartphone has\" \u2013 meaning they are unable to cope with the intense demands of running an LLM.",
      "Complex humanoid machines with robotic arms and limbs are another form of technology that could take on basic tasks and functions in space, particularly as they more closely mimic the physical capabilities of humans.",
      "Nasa's Valkyrie robot was built by the Johnson Space Center to compete in a 2013 robotics challenge trial. Weighing 300lb and standing at 6ft2in, it looks not unlike a Star Wars Stormtrooper, but it is one of an increasing number of human-like machines with superhuman abilities.",
      "Long before the Valkyrie was created, Nasa's Robonaut was the first humanoid robot designed for use in space, taking on tasks that were otherwise performed by humans.",
      "Its specially designed hands meant it could use the same tools as astronauts and carry out complex, delicate tasks like grasping objects or flicking switches, that were too challenging for other robotic systems.",
      "A later model of the Robonaut was flown to the International Space Station on the space shuttle Discovery in 2011, where it helped with maintenance and assembly.",
      "\"If we need to change a component or clean a solar panel, we could do that robotically,\" says Dr Shaun Azimi, lead of the dexterous robotics team at Nasa's Johnson Space Center in Texas. \"We see robots as a way to secure these habitats when humans aren't around.\"",
      "He argues that robots could be useful, not to replace human explorers but to work alongside them.",
      "Some robots are already working on other planets without humans, sometimes even making decisions on their own. Nasa's Curiosity rover, for example, is exploring a region called Gale Crater on Mars and autonomously performs some of its science without human input.",
      "\"You can direct the rover to take pictures of a scene, look for rocks that might fit science priorities for the mission, and then autonomously fire its laser at that target,\" says Dr Wagstaff.",
      "\"It can get a reading of a particular rock and send it back to Earth while the humans are still asleep.\"",
      "But the capabilities of rovers like Curiosity are limited by their slow pace. And there is something else they cannot compete with too. That is, humans have the added bonus of inspiring people back on Earth in a way that machines cannot.",

      "On a cold February night in 1946, a 15-year-old schoolboy made a surprising discovery as he peered out of his bedroom window.",
      "Michael Woodman, a keen amateur astronomer from Newport, had stayed up late waiting for his father to come home when he noticed something strange in the night sky.",
      "\"There was the constellation of Corona Borealis, but in the ring of the Corona, the second star down was bright - very bright,\" he explains.",
      "\"And I thought 'I've never seen anything like that before.'\"",
      "The next morning he wrote to the Astronomer Royal. The now 94-year-old smiles as he recalls the memory, surprised that his teenage self would be so bold.",
      "\"And bless me if the Astronomer Royal didn't reply, with a letter I've still got.\"",
      "Michael Woodman had witnessed a rare celestial event that briefly dazzled the heavens. Not only that, the Astronomer Royal informed him that he was the first person in the country to have seen this.",
      "He'd spotted a star system, about 3,000 light years away, called T Corona Borealis - or T Cor Bor for short - exploding into brightness, becoming visible in the night sky for a few short days.",
      "\"I hit the jackpot,\" he says.",
      "How to look for T Cor Bor",
      "Now a whole new generation of stargazers are scanning the skies again because scientists believe T Cor Bor ignites about every 80 years or so.",
      "On a crystal clear night, in the Dark Skies Reserve of Bannau Brycheiniog, also known as the Brecon Beacons, astronomers are setting up their telescopes.",
      "\"T Cor Bor is dim at the minute  - it's magnitude 10, well below what you can see with the naked eye,\" explains Dr Jenifer Millard from Fifth Star Labs.",
      "To find the area of sky where it should appear, she advises to first locate the plough and follow its handle to Arcturus. To the west of this star is the curved constellation of Corona Borealis, made up of seven stars, and where T Cor Bor will at some point light up.",
      "\"It is only going to be visible to the naked eye for a couple of days,\" she says.",
      "\"Of course, if you've got a small pair of binoculars or a small telescope, you'll be able to see it for a little bit longer because you've got that magnifying tool. But I do think that it is the short stint in the sky that makes it really special.\"",
      "The astronomical phenomenon is caused by the interaction between two stars orbiting each other.",
      "A small white dwarf, which is a dead star, is locked in a cosmic dance with a much larger red giant - a star that's reaching the end of its life.",
      "The compact white dwarf has an immense gravitational pull, so great that it steals material away from its larger neighbour.",
      "\"The gravity on the surface of the white dwarf is a million times the gravity we feel on Earth, so if we stood on it, we would be crushed instantly,\" explains Dr Jane Clark, from the Cardiff Astronomical Society.",
      "Over time, the material it grabs from the other star gets crushed and compressed - until eventually it triggers a nuclear explosion, releasing a huge amount of energy - a process known as going nova.",
      "\"And when that happens, it will shine like the best Christmas tree in town,\" says Dr Clark.",
      "Astronomers think this process happens on repeat, with an outburst from T Cor Bor occurring about every 80 years.",
      "But there aren't many records of this. And there have already been a few false alarms that T Cor Bor was about to appear - followed by a disappointing no show.",
      "But Dr Chris North from Cardiff University says astronomers around the world are poised to catch the light show, which will allow them to study this star in more detail than ever before.",
      "And he's hopeful it could appear soon.",
      "\"It seems that in the past, this has dimmed a little bit before it's actually erupted, and there are signs that maybe, at the moment, it's just dipping a little bit in brightness,\" he says.",
      "\"So maybe that's a hint that it's getting close to its eruption.\"",
      "Michael Woodman certainly wants to see T Cor Bor again.",
      "\"Somebody will get me into a car and drive me out into the wild somewhere so I can have a decent look. That's what we are hoping for,\" he says.",
      "And if he catches another glimpse of the light show, he believes it will put him in a very exclusive club - of just one.",
      "\"Eighty years on, we're all looking at the skies again, not only me, but the whole world apparently,\" he says.",
      "\"If I'm alive, if I see it, I will be the only one who's seen it twice.\"",
      "Then with a big broad smile and a little chuckle, he adds: \"Got to keep breathing!\""

      "Heavy snow blends into white thick clouds in Skellefte\u00e5, a riverside city in northern Sweden that is home to 78,000 residents.",
      "It's also the location of what was supposed to become Europe's biggest and greenest electric battery factory, powered by the region's abundance of renewable energy.",
      "Swedish start-up Northvolt opened its flagship production plant here in 2022, after signing multi-billion euro contracts with carmakers including BMV, Volkswagen and Nordic truck manufacturer Scania.",
      "But it ran into major financial troubles last year, reporting debts of $5.8bn (\u00a34.6bn) in November, and filing for bankruptcy in the US, where it had been hoping to expand its operations.",

      "\"A lot of people have moved out already,\" says 43-year-old Ghanaian Justice Dey-Seshie, who relocated to Skellefte\u00e5 for a job at Northvolt, after previously studying and working in southern Sweden.",
      "\"I need to secure a job in order to extend my work permit. Otherwise, I have to exit the country, sadly.\"",
      "Many researchers and journalists tracking Northvolt's downfall share the view that it was at least partly caused by a global dip in demand for electric vehicles (EVs).",
      "In September Volvo abandoned its target to only produce EVs by 2030, arguing that \"customers and markets are moving at different speeds\". Meanwhile China, the market leader in electric batteries, has been able to undercut Northvolt's prices.",
      "Missing production targets (a key factor in BMW pulling out of a \u20ac2bn deal in June), expanding too quickly, and the company's leadership have also been widely cited as factors fuelling the crisis.",
      "\"To build batteries is a very complex process. It takes a lot of capital, it takes time, and they obviously just didn't have the right personnel running the company,\" argues Andreas Cervenka, a business author and economics commentator for Swedish daily Aftonbladet.",
      "At Ume\u00e5 university, Madeleine Eriksson, a geographer researching the impact of so-called \"green industries\" says Northvolt presented a \"save the world mentality\" that impressed investors, media and local politicians.",
      "But this \"now-or-never\" approach, she argues, glossed over the fact it was a risk-taking start-up that \"never finished attracting investment\".",
      "Northvolt did not respond to multiple requests from the BBC to respond to comments about its downfall or future plans.",
      "The firm has hired German Marcus Dangelmaier, from global electronics company TE Connectivity to run Northvolt's operations in Skellefe\u00e5, from January, as it seeks to attract fresh investment.",

      "The region is a hub for biotech and renewable energy. Alongside Northvolt, high profile companies include Stegra (formerly called H2 Green Steel) and Hybrit, which are both developing fossil-free steel using hydrogen.",
      "But Mr Cervenka, the economics commentator, argues Northvolt's downfall has damaged Sweden's \"very good brand\" when it comes to green technologies.",
      "\"There was a huge opportunity to build this champion, and to build this Swedish icon, but I think investors that lost money are going to be hesitant to invest again in a similar project in the north of Sweden,\" he says.",
      "Some local businesses say the publicity around Northvolt's crisis is already having a negative impact.",
      "\"I feel it myself when I travel now \u2013 even to the southern parts of Sweden \u2013 and abroad, that people really ask me questions,\" says Joakim Nordin, CEO of Skellefte\u00e5 Kraft, a major hydropower and wind energy provider, which was an early investor in Northvolt.",
      "Headquartered in Malm\u00f6 in southern Sweden, Cleantech for Nordics is an organisation that represents a coalition of 15 major investors in sustainability-focussed start-ups.",
      "Here, climate policy analyst Eva Andersson believes the nation's long legacy as an environmental champion will remain relevant.",
      "\"I think it would be presumptuous to say that, okay, now we are doomed here in the Nordics because one company has failed,\" she argues.",
      "Cleantech for Nordics' research suggests there were more than 200 investments in clean tech projects in Sweden in 2023.",
      "Another study by Dealroom, which gathers data on start-ups indicates 74% of all venture capital funding to Swedish start-ups went to so-called impact companies which prioritise environmental or social sustainability, compared to a European average of just 35%.",
      "\"Sweden is still punching above its weight in this sector. And I think we could expect it to continue to do so moving forward as well,\" predicts Anderson.",
      "There are growing calls for increased state support to help Sweden maintain its position. The Swedish government refused to bail out Northvolt, suggesting all startups \u2013 sustainable or not \u2013 should be subject to market forces rather than bailed out by taxpayers. But as other parts of the world ramp up battery production and other carbon-cutting industries, the decision has faced a backlash.",
      "\"The US and China have massive support packages for green industry, and they definitely are catching up and overtaking in some sectors. And so that is definitely a threat to be reckoned with,\" argues Andersson.",
      "Just 3% of global battery cell production\u202fcurrently takes place in Europe - according to research for international consultancy firm McKinsey - with Asian firms leading the market.",
      "Sweden's minister for Energy, Business and Industry Ebba Busch argues more EU support rather than funding from individual governments is the answer.",
      "Last month she told Swedish television the situation at Northvolt was \"not a Swedish crisis\", rather a reflection of a Europe-wide challenge when it comes to competitiveness in the electric battery sector.",
      "But while the government insists it wants Sweden to play a key role in Europe's battery industry, and the wider green transition, it has been accused of sending mixed messages. The right-wing coalition, which came into power in 2022 has cut taxes on petrol and diesel, and abolished subsidies for EVs.",
      "\"This is a very politically sensitive area,\" says journalist Cervenka. \"The Swedish government is being actually criticised internationally for not fulfilling its climate obligations. And that is a stark contrast to the image of Sweden as a pioneer.\"",
      "The BBC approached Busch's media team, but was not granted an interview.",
      "Back in Skellefte\u00e5, where it has been dark since just after lunch, Joachim Nordin is preparing to commute home in the snow.",
      "He says there's a strong industrial will for Sweden to remain a green tech role model, despite policymakers being \"not as ambitious\" as previous administrations.",
      "The criteria that enticed Northvolt to establish its first factory in Skellefte\u00e5 will also attract other big global players to the region, according to the energy company CEO.",
      "\"It's 100% almost renewable energy up here\u2026 and that's that's pretty unique if you compare it to the rest of Europe. But on top of that we are among the cheapest places in the world for the electricity prices. So if you combine those two things, it's a huge opportunity.\"",
      "Skellefe\u00e5 Kraft recently announced a collaboration with Dutch fuel company Sky NRG. Their ambition is to open a large factory by 2030, making fossil-free plane fuel (produced using hydrogen combined with carbon dioxide captured from biogenic sources).",
      "\"The publicity around Northvolt is not helping now, of course. But I hope that that's just something that will be remembered as a little bump in the road, when we look back at this 10 years from now,\" says Mr Nordin.",

      "A US court has rejected the Biden administration's bid to restore \"net neutrality\" rules, finding that the federal government does not have the authority to regulate internet providers like utilities.",
      "It marks a major defeat for so-called open internet advocates, who have long fought for protections that would require internet providers such as AT&T to treat all legal content equally.",
      "Such rules were first introduced by the Federal Communications Commission under former Democratic president Barack Obama but later repealed during Republican Donald Trump's first term.",
      "The decision, just as Trump is poised to enter the White House for a second term, likely puts an end to the long-running legal battle over the issue.",
      "In their decision, the judges noted that different administrations have gone back and forth on the issue.",

    "story": [
      "In 1995, the BBC's Tomorrow's World programme decided to predict what the world would look like 30 years later, in 2025.",
      "The show, which is no longer broadcast, featured one of the most famous scientists of the age, Prof Stephen Hawking, who predicted: \"By 2025 we can expect big changes.\"",

      "So, with the help of some experts - and the benefit of three decades of hindsight - let's take a look at how much of today's world that Tomorrow's World successfully anticipated.",
      "The 'Cyberspace Riots' of 2005",
      "In 1995, the world wide web was really taking off - a development Tomorrow's World thought would bring future trouble.",
      "They predicted \"business barons\" and banks would take control of the internet by 2000, establishing a \"supernet\" which they restricted access to.",
      "That, in turn, would prompt hacks, viruses and even riots.",
      "Verdict - The internet has remained - mostly - open, and there have been no riots but there is little doubt the actions of hackers have caused misery for many people.",
      "One thing the programme didn't predict was the role of the nation state hackers like North Korea, expertly told in the BBC's Lazarus Heist podcast.",
      "Cybersecurity is hugely important for governments and companies, and people who are suspicious of banks have championed cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",
      "Asteroid mining and space junk gel",
      "The programme speculated space mining would become a lucrative industry, with companies excavating asteroids near Earth for precious metals.",
      "The show also suggested space junk would become such a problem it would not be safe for astronauts. The answer - a gigantic foam gel to slow down debris.",

      "Instead, patient holograms would be sent to them and the surgeon would operate using \"spacial gloves\". At the patient's end, a robot would perfectly mimic the movements of the surgeon.",

      "Verdict - Banking has indeed become more and more automated. And though paying via microchips inside the human body is a reality, other technologies - mainly fingerprint and face scanning - are much more widely used.",
      "Memories from the presenters",
      "Gardeners' World star Monty Don was one of the presenters on that Tomorrow's World programme 30 years ago. His segment predicted a huge restoration of British woodlands thanks to genetic engineering and multi-storey agri facilities, leading to the return of animals including the brown bear.",

      "Futurist Tracey Follows thought the 1995 programme got a lot of big ideas right, but missed two of the biggest themes of the last 30 years - the spread of big tech and social media.",

      "\"Brainstorming will literally be brainstorming, where you can share ideas by thinking them.\"",
      "Tom Cheesewright thinks two of the most exciting prospects for the next 30 years will be materials science and bioengineering.",
      "In materials, the creation of devices that are even stronger, lighter and thinner could change the world, while bioengineering - married with tight regulation - has the power to transform medicine and tackle \"some of the biggest challenges humanity faces - decarbonisation, clean water, food\".",
      "So what do you think the world will look like in 30 years?",
      "Whatever your answers, it would be wise to listen to what Prof Hawking said to Tomorrow's World three decades ago.",
      "\"Some of these changes are very exciting, and some are alarming. The one thing that we can be sure of is that it will be very different, and probably not what we expect.\"",

      "In cases in which more applications are received than visas are available, the USCIS effectively runs the H-1B programme as a lottery - which detractors believe highlights a fundamental flaw in the system.",
      "\"Ultimately, if you're going to have a skilled worker programme for 'skilled' workers, you don't award these visas via a lottery,\" says Eric Ruark, the director of research at NumbersUSA, an organisation that advocates for tighter immigration controls.",
      "\"Obviously, that's not how you find the best and the brightest.\"",
      "We don't have a full report on the 2024 numbers yet, but preliminary figures suggest applications have increased sharply.",
      "The number of eligible registrations published by the USCIS showed 758,994 applications in 2024, compared with 474,421 in 2023.",
      "With Trump headed back to the White House in January, Mr Ruark says he believes that the resolution of the H-1B debate will ultimately be among the factors that defines his presidency.",
      "\"Is that second term going to be pro-American worker, or revert to the old establishment Republican position that immigration is designed to help employers - at the expense of American workers?\" he says.",
      "\"That's going to be a huge fight in the second term.\"",
      "What industries and companies do they work in?",
      "The vast majority of approved applicants work in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.",
      "Most are in computer-related occupations - 65% in the 2023 fiscal year.",
      "This was followed by architecture, engineering and surveying - about 10% of people approved in 2023 worked in those sectors.",
      "In terms of companies, Amazon was the top employer of people on H-1B visas in 2024, hiring more than 13,000 staff via the scheme.",
      "Other familiar names like Google, Meta, and Apple feature high on the employer list - ranking 4th, 6th and 8th respectively.",
      "Tesla, one of the companies owned by Elon Musk - who has backed the programme - ranked 22nd, employing more than 1,700 people on an H-1B visa.",
      "California and Texas were the states with the most people working on an H-1B visa in 2024.",
      "How much do they earn?",
      "The median yearly income of people approved to work in the US on an H-1B visa in the 2023 fiscal year was $118,000 (\u00a394,000).",
      "The median yearly income for people in computer and mathematical occupations across the US is about $113,000 (\u00a390,000) - slightly less than those in similar sectors via the H-1B programme.",
      "The median household income in the US is about $60,000 (\u00a348,000) per year.",
      "While opponents of the H-1B system often make the argument that H-1B holders undercut the salaries of American workers, some immigration lawyers and experts push back on that notion.",
      "The vast majority of H-1B holders earn more than the \"prevailing wage\" for their occupation - a Department of Labor-determined figure that calculates the average wage paid to similarly employed workers in a particular part of the country.",
      "Shev Dalal-Dheini, senior director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told the BBC that, while prevailing wages \"are not a full labour market test\", they are indicative of the fact that H-1B visa holders aren't negatively affecting the rest of the workforce.",
      "\"Let's say you're a software engineer in Washington DC. You look at the going rate for software engineers in DC, and you have to certify that you're paying at least that amount,\" says Ms Dalal-Dheini, who also worked on H-1B issues while as an official at USCIS.",
      "\"You're not really undercutting wages that way.\"",
      "Additionally, Ms Dalal-Dheini says that US firms must also pay significant fees to file H-1B petitions, often in addition to lawyer fees.",
      "\"Companies that end up sponsoring H-1B [recipients] are looking at costs of up to $5,000 to $10,000 in addition to what you would have to pay an American worker,\" she says.",
      "\"The bottom line is that if they could find an American worker that was qualified, most companies would probably choose to hire that American worker, because it would be a cost savings.\"",
      "Where are people coming from?",
      "The vast majority of those approved come from India.",
      "The latest data showed around 72% of visas were issued to Indian nationals, followed by 12% to Chinese citizens.",
      "About 1% came from the Philippines, Canada and South Korea respectively.",
      "About 70% of those who enter the US on H-1B visas are men, with the average age of those approved being around 33.",

      "There's a hope that things will bounce back - at least in part - next year.",
      "And two huge releases in particular are likely to cut through in a big way.",
      "Grand Theft Auto 6",
      "A cultural moment, a day millions of gamers have been awaiting for a very, very long time.",
      "The release of Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6).",
      "It's due to land in autumn, 12 years after predecessor GTA 5 arrived on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, breaking launch records.",
      "The sequel already broke records with its first trailer, which racked up an astonishing 90 million views in 24 hours when it debuted last December.",
      "And that probably won't be the last record that will be broken.",
      "\"The anticipation for this is impossible to measure,\" says James Batchelor, editor-in-chief of GamesIndustry.biz.",
      "\"It's undoubtedly going to be one of, if not the biggest, game launches of all time.\"",
      "Developer Rockstar hasn't revealed a huge amount about the new game beyond its dual protagonists and scenes from its fictional, Florida-inspired setting Leonida.",
      "The big question on most fans' minds is whether the release date will slip, as has happened for previous big releases from Rockstar.",
      "James says he's seen nothing to suggest that it will - yet - but if things stay quiet it's time to start worrying.",
      "\"If we still have seen absolutely nothing by summer, and certainly if we've seen nothing of it by, say, end of August, then yeah, that's going to 2026,\" he says.",
      "Why is GTA 6 so important?",
      "The release of GTA 6 is expected to have an impact on the wider games industry.",
      "\"I think it will probably be one of those moments where the rising tide is going to lift all of the boats,\" says George Osborn, consultant and author of the Video Games Industry Memo newsletter.",
      "He says a big hit - especially one with the cultural resonance of GTA - can get more people \"in the mood to buy video games\" and publishers want to capitalise on that.",
      "There are other big releases planned for this year - Assassin's Creed Shadows from French publisher Ubisoft, Ghost of Y\u014dtei from Sony and strategy game Civilization VII, to name just three.",
      "\"The challenge for the developers is how do you keep yourself out of the Grand Theft Auto window?,\" says George.",
      "Avoiding the juggernaut of GTA 6 will likely mean other publishers launch their new games early in the year or even hold them back to early 2026.",
      "One more thing we do know is that the game will release first on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles, with a PC release to follow later.",
      "Many gamers are still sticking with their previous-generation machines, and Sony and Microsoft will be hoping GTA 6 will finally inspire them to upgrade.",
      "\"If anything is going to convince people to jump to a new console if they haven't already it's going to be GTA 6,\" says James, who estimates that PlayStation 4 users still count for 50% of Sony's active players.",
      "But if we're talking hardware upgrades, there could be some competition.",

      "Despite unconfirmed leaks and rumours the machine's capabilities remain a mystery and the company's promised some sort of official announcement by the end of March.",
      "There's a feeling, though, that Nintendo won't want to change the winning formula of the original Switch, which has sold 146 million units since its 2017 launch.",
      "\"The sensible money is on just a bigger, better Switch,\" says James.",
      "Expect it to look similar with more processing power under the bonnet.",
      "\"That might sound reductive,\" he adds.",
      "\"But given the level of success this has had they would be daft to not just build on the foundation they've made here.\"",
      "James argues that confirmation of backwards compatibility - being able to play games originally made for the first Switch - strongly suggests the new machine won't be a million miles away from its younger sibling.",
      "He says there is a danger that, as has happened with previous Nintendo consoles, customers might not understand that the new machine is different to what they've already got at home.",
      "But James isn't sure it will experience the same fate.",

      "\"On the triple-A side a lot of critics and players have said 'it's such a quiet year, there's not many big releases', but for indie games, there's always so many cool things to play.\"",
      "A success like Balatro is incredibly rare, and one of the big issues for indie developers in 2024 has been discoverability - getting players to actually find your game.",
      "Rachel says the number of releases on Steam - the online store where most PC games are bought - is \"frankly bonkers\" and getting noticed is \"one of the most difficult things\".",
      "\"I just don't see that becoming any easier,\" she says.",
      "Rachel says indie developers are also struggling to find investment and the financial outlook is \"pretty bleak\" going into 2025.",
      "But she does think that more gamers are starting to recognise the creativity that exists in the sector - and more breakout hits will follow.",
      "\"The indie space is a place where I retreat to just play games that get me excited about gaming again,\" says Rachel.",

      "George says the esports Olympics will revive conversations about sportswashing - the idea that Saudi Arabia uses its vast wealth to invest in sports and entertainment to improve its international reputation - something it's denied.",

      "Sixty-year-old Chinese grandmother Su Min had no intention of becoming a feminist icon.",
      "She was only trying to escape her abusive husband when she hit the road in 2020 in her white Volkswagen hatchback with a rooftop tent and her pension.",
      "\"I felt like I could finally catch my breath,\" she says, recalling the moment she drove away from her old life. \"I felt like I could survive and find a way of life that I wanted.\"",
      "Over the next four years and 180,000 miles, the video diaries she shared of her adventures, while detailing decades of pain, earned her millions of cheerleaders online. They called her the \"road-tripping auntie\" as she inadvertently turned into a hero for women who felt trapped in their own lives.",
      "Her story is now a hit film that was released in September - Like a Rolling Stone \u2013 and she made it to the BBC's list of 100 inspiring and influential women of 2024.",
      "It was a year of big moments, but if she had to describe what 2024 meant to her in a single word, she says that word would be \"freedom\".",
      "As soon as Su Min started driving, she felt freer, she told the BBC over the phone from Shenyang \u2013 just before she headed south for winter in her new SUV with a caravan.",
      "But it wasn't until 2024, when she finally filed for divorce, that she experienced \"another kind of freedom\".",
      "It took a while to get there: it's a complicated process in China and her husband refused to divorce her until she agreed to pay him. They settled on 160,000 yuan ($21,900; \u00a317,400) but she is still waiting for the divorce certificate to come through.",
      "But she is resolute that she doesn't want to look back: \"I'm saying goodbye to him.\"",
      "The road to freedom",
      "In her new life on the road, Su Min's duty is to herself.",
      "Her videos mostly feature only her. Although she drives alone, she never seems lonely. She chats with her followers as she films her journey, sharing what she has been cooking, how she spent the previous day and where she's going next.",
      "Her audience travels with her to places they never knew they would long for \u2013 Xinjiang's snow-capped mountains, Yunnan's ancient river towns, sparkling blue lakes, vast grasslands, endless deserts.",
      "They applaud her bravery and envy the freedom she has embraced. They had rarely heard such a raw first-hand account about the reality of life as a \"Chinese auntie\".",
      "China's matchmaking mums have a powerful ally: The Party",
      "China's giant sinkholes are a tourist hit - but ancient forests inside are at risk",
      "\"You're so brave! You chose to break free,\" wrote one follower, while another urged her to \"live the rest of your life well for yourself!\". One woman sought advice because she too \"dreams of driving alone\" and an awe-struck follower said: \"Mom, look at her! When I get older, I'll live a colourful life like hers if I don't get married!\"",
      "For some, the takeaways are more pragmatic yet inspiring: \"After watching your videos, I've learned this: as women, we must own our own home, cultivate friendships far and wide, work hard to be financially independent, and invest in unemployment insurance!\"",
      "Through it all, Su Min processes her own past. A stray cat she encounters on the road reminds her of herself, both of them having \"weathered the wind and rain for years but still managing to love this world that dusts our faces\". A visit to the market, where she smells chili peppers, evokes \"the smell of freedom\" because throughout her marriage spicy food was forbidden by her husband who didn't like it.",
      "For years Su Min had been the dutiful daughter, wife and mother \u2013 even as her husband repeatedly struck her.",
      "\"I was a traditional woman and I wanted to stay in my marriage for life,\" she says. \"But eventually I saw that I got nothing in return for all my energy and effort \u2013 only beatings, violence, emotional abuse and gaslighting.\"",
      "Her husband, Du Zhoucheng, has admitted to hitting her. \"It's my mistake that I beat you,\" he said in a video she recently shared on Douyin, TikTok's China platform.",
      "A high school graduate, he had a government job in the water resources ministry for 40 years before retiring, according to local media reports. He told an outlet in 2022 that he beat his wife because she \"talked back\" and that it was \"an ordinary thing\": \"In a family, how can there not be some bangs and crashes?\"",
      "When duty called",
      "Su Min married Du Zhoucheng \"really to avoid my father's control, and to avoid the whole family\".",
      "She was born and raised in Tibet until 1982, when her family moved to Henan, a bustling province in the valley along the Yellow River. She had just finished high school and found work in a fertiliser factory, where most of her female colleagues, including those younger than 20, already had husbands.",
      "Her marriage was arranged by a matchmaker, which was common at the time. She had spent much of her life cooking for and looking after her father and three younger brothers. \"I wanted to change my life,\" she says.",
      "The couple met only twice before the wedding. She wasn't looking for love, but she hoped that love would grow once they married.",
      "Su Min did not find love. But she did have a daughter, and that is one reason she convinced herself she needed to endure the abuse.",
      "\"We are always so afraid of being ridiculed and blamed if we divorce, so we all choose to endure, but in fact, this kind of patience is not right,\" she says. \"I later learned that, in fact, it can have a considerable impact on children. The child really doesn't want you to endure, they want you to stand up bravely and give them a harmonious home.\"",
      "She thought of leaving her husband after her daughter got married, but soon she became a grandmother. Her daughter had twins \u2013 and once again duty called. She felt she needed to help care for them, although by now she had been diagnosed with depression.",
      "\"I felt that if I didn't leave, I would get sicker,\" she says. She promised her daughter she would care for the two boys until they went to kindergarten, and then she would leave.",
      "The spark of inspiration for her escape came in 2019 while flicking through social media. She found a video about someone travelling while living in their van. This was it, she thought to herself. This was her way out.",
      "Even the pandemic did not stop her. In September 2020, she drove away from her marital home in Zhengzhou and she barely looked back as she made her way through 20 Chinese provinces and more than 400 cities.",
      "It's a decision that has certainly resonated with women in China. To her millions of followers, Su Min offers comfort and hope. \"We women are not just someone's wife or mother\u2026 Let's live for ourselves!\" wrote one follower.",
      "Many of them are mothers who share their own struggles. They tell her that they too feel trapped in suffocating marriages \u2013 some say her stories have inspired them to walk out of abusive relationships.",
      "\"You are a hero to thousands of women and many now see the possibility of a better life because of you,\" reads one of the top comments on one of her most-watched videos.",
      "\"When I turn 60, I hope I can be as free as you,\" another comment says.",
      "A third woman asks: \"Auntie Su, can I travel with you? I'll cover all the expenses. I just want to take a trip with you. I feel so trapped and depressed in my current life.\"",
      "'Love yourself'",
      "\"Can you have the life of your dreams?\" Su Min pondered over the call. \"I want to tell you that no matter how old you are, as long as you work hard, you will definitely find your answer. Just like me, even though I'm 60 now, I found what I was looking for.\"",
      "She admits it wasn't easy and she had to live frugally on her pension. She thought the video blogs might help raise some money \u2013 she had no idea they would go viral.",
      "She talks about what she's learned over the years and her latest challenge \u2013 finalising the  divorce.",
      "\"I haven't got my divorce certificate yet, because the law has a cooling-off period and we are now in that period.\"",
      "One of her followers wrote that the money she paid her husband was \"worth every penny\", adding: \"Now it's your turn to see the world and live a vibrant, unrestrained life. Congratulations, Auntie - here's to a colourful and fulfilling future!\"",
      "She says it's hard to get a divorce because \"many of our laws in China are to protect the family. Women often dare not divorce because of family disharmony\".",
      "At first, she thought that Du Zhoucheng's behaviour might improve with time and distance, but she said he still threw \"pots and pans\" at her on her return.",
      "He has only called her twice in the last few years \u2013 once because her highway access card was tied to his credit card and he wanted her to return 81 yuan (\u00a38.91). She says she hasn't used that card since then.",
      "Undeterred by the delay in securing a divorce, Su Min keeps planning more trips and hopes to one day travel abroad.",
      "She's worried about overcoming language barriers, but is confident her story will  resonate around the world - as it has in China.",
      "\"Although women in every country are different, I would like to say that no matter what environment you are in, you must be good to yourself. Learn to love yourself, because only when you love yourself can the world be full of sunshine.\"",

      "The president-elect has denied all wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty, arguing the case was an attempt to harm his 2024 presidential campaign.",

      "\"President Trump must be allowed to continue the presidential transition process and to execute the vital duties of the presidency, unobstructed by the remains of this or any remnants of the witch hunts,\" Cheung said.",

      "His options included delaying the sentencing until Trump, 78, leaves the White House in 2029, or guaranteeing a sentence that would not involve prison time.",
      "Trump had initially, and unsuccessfully, argued the case against him ran afoul of a Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity.",
      "In July, the country's top court ruled that presidents have broad immunity from criminal prosecution for \"official actions\" they take while in office.",
      "However, last month Justice Merchan ruled Trump's hush money conviction was valid.",

      "While falsifying business records is punishable by up to four years in prison in the US, there is no minimum sentence and incarceration is not required.",

      "The president-elect was initially scheduled to be sentenced on 26 November, but Justice Merchan pushed the date back after Trump won the presidential election."

      "Exactly two months after her election loss to Donald Trump, Vice-President Kamala Harris will preside over the certification of her own defeat.",
      "As president of the Senate, on Monday she will stand at the House Speaker's rostrum to lead the counting of Electoral College votes, officially cementing her rival's triumph two weeks before he returns to the White House.",
      "The circumstances are painful and awkward for a candidate who decried her opponent as an urgent threat to American democracy, but Harris aides insist she will conduct her constitutional and legal duty with seriousness and grace.",
      "It is not the first time a losing candidate will lead the joint session of Congress to count their opponent's presidential electors - Al Gore endured the indignity in 2001 and Richard Nixon in 1961.",
      "But it's a fitting coda to an improbable election that saw Harris elevated from a back-up to the nation's oldest president to the Democratic standard bearer - whose fleeting campaign provided a jolt of hope to her party before a crushing loss exposed deep internal faultlines.",
      "Harris and her team are now deliberating her second act, and weighing whether it includes another run for the White House in 2028 or pursuing a bid for the governor's mansion in her home state of California.",
      "While recent Democratic candidates who lost elections - Al Gore, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton - have decided against seeking the presidency again, aides, allies and donors argue that the groundswell of support Harris captured in her unsuccessful bid and the unusual circumstances of her condensed campaign proves there's still scope for her to seek the Oval Office.",
      "They even point to Donald Trump's own circuitous political path - the former and future president's bookend wins in 2016 and 2024, despite losing as the incumbent in 2020.",
      "But while many Democrats do not blame Harris for Trump's win, some - stung by a bruising loss that has called the party's strategy into question - are deeply sceptical of giving her another shot at the White House. A host of Democratic governors who coalesced behind the vice-president in 2024 but have ambitions of their own are seen by some strategists as fresher candidates with a much better chance of winning.",
      "Harris herself is said to be in no rush to make any decisions, telling advisers and supporters she is open to all the possibilities that await her after Inauguration Day on 20 January.",
      "She is assessing the last few months, which saw her launch an entirely new White House campaign, vet a running-mate, lead a party convention and barnstorm the country in just 107 days. And aides point out that she remains the US vice-president, at least for another two weeks.",
      "\"She has a decision to make and you can't make it when you're still on the treadmill. It may have slowed down \u2013 but she's on the treadmill until 20 January,\" said Donna Brazile, a close Harris ally who advised the campaign.",
      "\"You can't put anyone in a box. We didn't put Al Gore in a box and it was obvious the country was very divided after the 2000 election,\" said Brazile, who ran Gore's campaign against George W Bush and pointed to his second life as an environmental activist. \"All options are on the table because there's an appetite for change and I do believe that she can represent that change in the future.\"",
      "But the nagging question that shadows any potential 2028 run is whether the 60-year-old can separate herself from Joe Biden - something she failed to do in the election campaign.",
      "Her allies in the party say that Biden's choice to seek re-election despite worries about his age, only then to ultimately drop out of the race with months to go, doomed her candidacy.",
      "Though Trump swept all seven battleground states and is the first Republican in 20 years to win the popular vote, his margin of victory was relatively narrow while Harris still won 75 million votes, an outcome her supporters argue can't be ignored as a currently faceless Democratic party rebuilds over the next four years.",
      "On the other side, those close to Biden remain convinced he could have defeated Trump again, despite surveys showing he had been bleeding support from key Democratic voting blocs.",
      "They point out that Harris fell short where the president didn't in 2020, underperforming with core Democratic groups like black and Latino voters. Critics continue to bring up her 2019 campaign to become the Democratic presidential nominee, which sputtered out in less than a year.",
      "\"People forget that had there been a real primary [in 2024], she never would have been the nominee. Everyone knows that,\" said one former Biden adviser.",
      "The adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, applauded Harris for reviving the Democratic base and helping key congressional races, but said Trump's campaign successfully undercut her on critical campaign issues including the economy and the border.",
      "Members of Trump's team, however, including his chief pollster, have acknowledged that Harris performed stronger as a candidate than Biden on certain issues like the economy among voters.",
      "Yet there's no escaping that any Democratic primary contest for 2028 would be a tough fight, with rising stars like Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and California Governor Gavin Newsom already weighing presidential runs.",
      "Some Democrats say that Harris would nonetheless start ahead of the pack, with national name recognition, a much-coveted mailing list and a deep bench of volunteers.",
      "\"What state party would not want her to come help them set the table for the 2026 midterm elections?\" Brazile said. \"She's going to have plenty opportunities not only to rebuild, but to strengthen the coalition that came together to support her in 2024.\"",
      "Others have suggested she could step out of the political arena entirely, running a foundation or establishing an institute of politics at her alma mater, Howard University, the Washington-based historically black college where she held her election night party.",
      "The former top state prosecutor could also be a contender for secretary of state or attorney general in a future Democratic administration. And she'll need to decide if she wants to write another book.",
      "For all of her options, Harris has told aides, she wants to remain visible and be seen as a leader in the party. One adviser suggested that she could exist outside the domestic political fray, taking on a more global role on an issue that matters to her, but that's a difficult perch without a platform as large as the vice-presidency.",
      "In the waning days of the Biden-Harris administration, she plans to embark on an international trip to multiple regions, according to a source familiar with the plans, signalling her desire to maintain a role on the world stage and build a legacy beyond being Biden's number two.",
      "For Harris and her team, the weeks since the election have been humbling, a mix of grief and resolve. Several aides described the three-month sprint that began when Biden dropped out as having begun with the campaign \"digging out of a hole\" and ending with their candidate more popular than when she began, even if she didn't win.",
      "\"There's a sense of peace knowing that given the hand we were dealt, we ran through the tape,\" said one senior aide.",
      "Following the election, Harris and her husband, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, spent a week in Hawaii with a small group of aides to relax and discuss her future.",
      "During a staff holiday party at her official residence before Christmas, Harris recounted election night and how she delivered a pep talk to her family as the results became clear.",
      "\"We are not having a pity party!\" she told the crowd of her reaction that night.",
      "Advisers and allies say she is still processing what happened, and wants to wait and see how the new administration unfolds in January before staking out any position, let alone seeking to become the face of any so-called Trump \"resistance\".",
      "Democrats have found the resistance movement that took off among liberals in the wake of his 2016 win no longer resonates in today's political climate, where the Republican has proven that his message and style appeals to a huge cross-section of Americans.",
      "They have adopted a more conciliatory approach in confronting the incoming president's agenda. As several Democrats put it: \"What resistance?\"",
      "Though she's kept a relatively low profile since her loss, Harris provided a glimpse of her mindset at an event for students at Prince George's Community College in Maryland in December.",
      "\"The movements for civil rights, women's rights, workers' rights, the United States of America itself, would never have come to be if people had given up their cause after a court case, or a battle, or an election did not go their way,\" she said.",
      "\"We must stay in the fight,\" she added, a refrain she has repeated since her 2016 Senate win. \"Everyone of us.\"",
      "What that means is less clear. For some donors and supporters, staying \"in the fight\" could translate to a run for California governor in 2026, when a term-limited Gavin Newsom will step down and potentially pursue his own White House ambitions. The job, leading the world's fifth-largest economy, would also put Harris in direct conflict with Trump, who has regularly assailed the state for its left-leaning policies.",
      "But governing a major state is no small feat, and would derail any presidential run,  as she would be sworn into office about the same time she would need to launch a national campaign.",
      "Those who have spoken to Harris said she remains undecided about the governor's race, which some allies have described as a potential \"capstone\" to her career.",
      "She has won statewide office three times as California's attorney general and later as a US senator. But a gubernatorial win would give her another historic honour - becoming the nation's first black female governor.",
      "Still, some allies acknowledge it would be difficult to transition from being inside a 20-car motorcade and having a seat across the table from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to the governor's mansion.",
      "The private sector is another option.",
      "\"For women at other levels of office, when they lose an election, sometimes options are not as available to them compared to men, who get a soft landing at a law firm or insurance business, and it gives them a place to take a beat, make some money and then make decisions about what's next,\" said Debbie Walsh, director for the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.",

    "published": "Sun, 05 Jan 2025 01:04:30 GMT",
    "summary": "The authorities want vehicles to switch to gas but the transition has been hampered by a lack of filling stations.",
    "story": [
      "A revolution in vehicle fuel is gaining momentum in Tanzania, but a lack of filling stations means it is stuck in second gear.",
      "Like Nigeria and some other countries on the continent, Tanzania is beginning to embrace compressed natural gas (CNG) as an alternative to petrol and diesel.",
      "It is seen as cleaner and better for the environment than those fossil fuels, but its relative cheapness is the biggest draw for the 5,000 or so motorists in the East African state who have embraced the change - particularly commercial drivers.",
      "This represents a small fraction of Tanzania's vehicles, but the early adopters are paving the way for a wider acceptance of CNG - the government reportedly wants near total adoption by the middle of the century.",
      "Tanzania has large reserves of gas under the sea and for those filling up, CNG can cost less than half its petrol equivalent.",
      "The potential saving was enough to persuade taxi owner Samuel Amos Irube to part with about 1.5m Tanzanian shillings ($620; \u00a3495) to convert his three-wheeled vehicle \u2013 known locally as a bajaji - to CNG.",
      "But now, having to get the gas twice a day, he often spends more time waiting at a filling station in the largest city, Dar es Salaam, than he does earning money.",
      "There are only four places in Tanzania's commercial hub where he can fill up.",
      "Quietly frustrated, he says he has to wait for at least three hours every time he wants to refuel, but the savings make it worth it, as he spends just 40% of what he would on the equivalent amount of petrol.",
      "The slow-moving queues of vehicles at the Ubungo CNG station snake down the road. Things are orderly \u2013 there are three clear lines, one for cars and two for bajajis \u2013 but the irritation is palpable.",
      "Medadi Kichungo Ngoma, in the queue for two hours already, stares at the vehicles ahead of him as he waits by his silver pick-up truck.",
      "He tells the BBC that he was among the first people in the city to convert his vehicle, which involved installing a large cylinder in the back of the pick-up, and reminisces about the short queues.",
      "\"Sometimes the attendant would have to be called to serve us,\" he says.",
      "He complains that the infrastructure has not expanded to accommodate the increasing demand.",
      "This is also the refrain heard at the largest of the city's CNG filling stations near the airport.",
      "Sadiki Christian Mkumbuka has waited here for three hours with his bajaji.",
      "\"The queue is very long,\" he says, adding that \"we should have as many stations as there are for petrol vehicles\".",
      "But the price consideration will keep people coming back.",
      "\"I pay 15,000 shillings ($6; \u00a35) to fill my 11kg gas tank, which goes for about 180km,\" says another motorist who introduces himself as Juma, adding that this is less than half the cost for petrol to cover the same distance.",
      "The push to encourage motorists to adopt CNG-powered vehicles in Tanzania was hatched over a decade ago but did not begin in earnest until 2018.",
      "Those in charge of the project acknowledge that they did not foresee the rapid rise in demand.",
      "Aristides Kato, the CNG project manager at the state-oil firm, the Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC), tells the BBC that there \"has been a very drastic increase\" recently in the use of natural gas by vehicle owners.",
      "\"We found ourselves not having enough infrastructure to support the demand for gas-using vehicles,\" he admits.",
      "The authorities, though, want more people to switch to CNG because it is a relatively clean-burning fossil fuel that results in fewer emissions of nearly all types of air pollutants, according to the UN.",
      "Plus the locally available natural gas should allow for cheaper prices than petrol. But the cost of converting a vehicle plus the lower mileage that a full tank gives a motorist compared to petrol or diesel may be putting some people off.",
      "However, the country manager of Taqa Arabia, an Egyptian company that runs the filling station near the airport, sees the growing demand as a \"positive sign that CNG use has started to develop in Tanzania\".",
      "Amr Aboushady says his firm plans to build more stations and hopes to \"replicate our success story in Egypt by helping the [Tanzanian] government best utilise natural gas as an affordable, reliable, cleaner source of energy\".",
      "Egypt has pioneered the use of CNG on the continent, with about half a million vehicles converted to a dual-fuel system since the 1990s.",
      "Other African countries that have approved CNG use for vehicles include South Africa, Kenya, Mozambique and Ethiopia.",
      "The authorities in Tanzania are committed to rolling out more infrastructure and hope to encourage more private investors to get involved.",
      "A central CNG \"mother station\" is being built in Dar es Salaam by TPDC, which will supply gas to smaller stations around the country.",
      "In addition, TPDC is acquiring five mobile CNG units that will be located in Dar es Salaam as well as the capital, Dodoma, and Morogoro.",
      "These measures should in the medium-term lead to shorter queues, but for the time being the lack of filling stations will continue to frustrate Tanzania's CNG pioneers.",

    "published": "Sat, 04 Jan 2025 01:30:16 GMT",
    "summary": "Friday's vote underscores the challenges for Trump in keeping House Republicans united to legislate his agenda.",
    "story": [
      "Shortly after Mike Johnson appeared to come up two votes shy of retaining the speakership of the House of Representatives on Friday, Marjorie Taylor Greene \u2013 the  loyal Trump ally and firebrand Republican congresswoman from Georgia \u2013 stood in the middle of the House chamber, intently speaking on her mobile phone.",
      "Although she covered the device with her hand, a sharp photographer for Reuters news agency, Evelyn Hockstein, captured the name of the person on the other end of the conversation \u2013 incoming White House chief of staff Susie Wiles.",
      "It was a tangible sign of the enormous interest President-elect Donald Trump was taking in this vote. Trump had enthusiastically endorsed Johnson to be speaker for the incoming session of Congress earlier this week, and defeat in the first round of balloting would have been an embarrassment.",
      "Behind the scenes, however, wheels were furiously turning \u2013 setting up a chaotic interlude in the House after Johnson had initially appeared headed to at least a temporary defeat.",
      "At one point, Johnson walked out of the chamber, followed by two of the men who had opposed him, Ralph Norman of North Carolina and Keith Self of Texas. Meanwhile, other members of the House and their families milled about and chatted, waiting to see what happened next.",
      "When Johnson ultimately returned, he was all smiles.",
      "Trump himself had made a direct appeal to Norman and Self to back Johnson via speakerphone conversation, Republican sources told news outlets including Politico.",
      "Because the vote had not been officially declared to be closed, Norman and Self were able to switch their votes to the Louisianian, putting him at just the 218 mark necessary to retain the speaker's gavel. Kentucky Congressman Thomas Massie was the lone Republican holdout.",
      "Both Norman and Self told reporters after the vote that they had spoken to Trump during the course of the day.",
      "Norman said he conversed with Trump twice on Friday. The first during a several-minute phone call when fellow Republican Nancy Mace handed him her phone and the president-elect was on the other line.",
      "The second time was a longer, 15-minute call that included Norman, Johnson and Self, he said, without confirming the exact timing.",
      "\"Trump was exactly right when he told me Mike is the only one who has the likeability factor,\" Norman said.",
      "He went on to describe Trump as \"enthusiastic\" about the Republican trifecta in Washington - control of the House, Senate and presidency.",
      "\"I said, 'Mr President I agree with you, I'm just hoping Mike has got the oomph to pull this off,'\" Norman said.",
      "Self also said he spoke with Trump several times on Friday.",
      "\"We had a discussion about the entire process,\" he said of his conversation with the president-elect.",
      "Ultimately, embarrassment was avoided \u2013 even if Trump publicly appeared to be more focused on other things.",
      "In the midst of the voting, as the names of House members were called in alphabetical order, the president-elect was complaining on social media about the possibility that US flags would be at half-staff during his 20 January inauguration \u2013 part of the traditional mourning process following the death of former president Jimmy Carter.",
      "Friday afternoon's proceedings underscored just how tenuous the Republican majority in the House of Representatives will be over the course of the coming months.",
      "Besides the three initial Republican votes against Johnson, another five hard-line conservatives \u2013 who have objected to the compromises Johnson has made with Democrats in the past - delayed casting their ballots during the initial roll call. While they ultimately relented, it was a very obvious shot across the speaker's bow.",
      "After the final vote, the House Freedom Caucus \u2013 some of whom were among the temporary holdouts \u2013 released a statement explaining that they ultimately backed Johnson because of their support for Trump.",
      "\"We did this despite our sincere reservations regarding the speaker's track record over the past 15 months,\" they wrote.",
      "For now, the party holds a 219 to 215 edge over Democrats - but that could shrink by two if Congresswoman Elise Stefanik of New York and  Michael Waltz of Florida fill administration jobs Trump has offered them. It will be months until special elections determine their replacements.",
      "That means Trump will have to hold his entire House Republican membership together if he wants to pass key pieces of his legislative agenda early in his presidency, including hardline immigration reforms, new tariffs, and tax and spending cuts.",
      "As Friday demonstrated, this could be a tall task.",

    "summary": "Time is running out for Nimisha Priya, who was convicted for the murder of a Yemeni man in 2017.",
    "story": [
      "Family members of an Indian nurse who is on death row in war-torn Yemen say they are pinning their hopes on a last-ditch effort to save her.",
      "Nimisha Priya, 34, was sentenced to death for the murder of a local man - her former business partner Talal Abdo Mahdi - whose chopped-up body was discovered in a water tank in 2017.",
      "Lodged in the central jail of capital Sanaa, she is set to be executed soon, with Mahdi al-Mashat, president of the rebel Houthis' Supreme Political Council, approving her punishment this week.",
      "Under the Islamic judicial system, known as Sharia, the only way to stop the execution now is securing a pardon from the victim's family. For months, Nimisha's relatives and supporters have been trying to do this by raising diyah, or blood money, to be paid to Mahdi's family, and negotiations have been going on.",
      "But with time running out, supporters say their hopes rest entirely on the family's decision.",
      "With the presidential sanction coming in, the public prosecutor's office will once again seek consent from Mahdi's family and ask if they have any objections to the execution, said Samuel Jerome, a Yemen-based social worker who holds a power of attorney on behalf of Nimisha's mother.",
      "\"If they say they do not want to or can pardon her, the sentence would be immediately stopped,\" he said.",
      "\"Forgiveness is the first step. Whether the family accepts the blood money comes only after that.\"",
      "Under Yemen's laws, Nimisha's family cannot directly contact the family of the victim and must hire negotiators.",
      "Subhash Chandran, a lawyer who has represented Nimisha's family in India in the past, told the BBC that the family had already crowdfunded $40,000 (\u00a332,268) for the victim's family. The money has been given in two tranches to the lawyers hired by the Indian government to negotiate the case (a delay in sending the second tranche affected the negotiations, Mr Jerome says).",
      "\"We now need to explore the scope for discussions with the [victim's] family, which is possible only with the Indian government's support,\" Mr Chandran said.",
      "India's foreign ministry has said they are aware of Nimisha's situation and are extending all possible help to the family.",
      "Her family is anxious but also hopeful.",
      "\"Nimisha has no knowledge of what is happening beyond the gates of prison,\" said her husband Tony Thomas, who spoke to her hours before the approval of the death sentence. \"The only thing she wants to know is if our daughter is fine.\"",
      "Nimisha's mother is currently in Sanaa, having travelled there last year after a court in India allowed her to go to the region controlled by Houthi rebels. She has met her daughter twice in prison since then.",
      "The first reunion was very emotional. \"Nimisha saw me... she said I had become weak and asked me to keep courage, and that God would save her. She asked me not to be sad,'' her mother Prema Kumari told the BBC.",
      "The second time, Ms Kumari was accompanied by two nuns who held prayers for her daughter in prison.",
      "Nimisha was barely 19 when she went to Yemen.",
      "The daughter of a poorly-paid domestic worker, she wanted to change her family's financial situation, and worked as a nurse in a government-run hospital in Sanaa for some years.",
      "In 2011, she returned home - Kochi city in southern India - and married Mr Thomas, a tuk-tuk driver.",
      "The couple moved to Yemen together shortly afterwards. But financial struggles forced Mr Thomas to return to India with their baby daughter.",
      "Tired of low-paying hospital jobs, Nimisha decided to open her own clinic in Yemen.",
      "As the law there mandated that she have a local partner, she opened the clinic jointly with Mahdi, a store owner.",
      "The two were initially on good terms - when Nimisha briefly visited India for her daughter's baptism, Mahdi accompanied her.",
      "\"He seemed like a nice man when he came to our house, \" Mr Thomas told the BBC.",
      "But Mahdi's attitude, Mr Thomas alleged, \"suddenly changed\" when the civil war broke out in Yemen in 2014.",
      "At that time, Nimisha was trying to finalise paperwork so her husband and daughter could join her again.",
      "But after the war broke out, the Indian government banned all travel to Yemen, making it impossible for them to go be with her.",
      "Over the coming days, thousands of Indians were evacuated from the country, but Nimisha chose to stay, as she had taken out huge loans to open her clinic.",
      "It was around then that Nimisha started to complain about Mahdi's behaviour, including allegations of physical torture, Mr Thomas said.",
      "A petition in court, filed by a group called Save Nimisha Priya International Action Council, alleged that Mahdi snatched all her money, seized her passport and even threatened her with a gun.",
      "After Mahdi's body was discovered in 2017, the police charged Nimisha with killing him by giving him an \"overdose of sedatives\", and allegedly chopping up his body.",
      "Nimisha denied the allegations. In court, her lawyer argued that she had tried to anaesthetise Mahdi just to retrieve her passport from him, but that the dose was accidentally increased.",
      "In 2020, a local court sentenced Nimisha to death. Three years later, in 2023, her family challenged the decision in Yemen's Supreme Court, but their appeal was rejected.",
      "Even with so many twists and turns, the family is not willing to give up hope.",
      "\"My heart says that we can arrive at a settlement and save Nimisha's life,'' Mr Thomas said.",
      "More than anything, he said he was worried about their daughter, now 13, who had \"never experienced a mother's love\".",
      "\"They speak on the phone every week and my daughter gets upset if she misses the call,\" Mr Thomas said.",

    "story": [
      "The worst way to watch \"Jaws\" is without music. A good way is to watch it with John Williams' famous score coming from your speakers. But the best way to watch \"Jaws\" might be with a live orchestra playing that iconic score.",
      "The New York Philharmonic plays for four movies a year at Lincoln Center. Almost every showing is sold out.",
      "\"A live orchestra absolutely reaches people in a way that no recorded sound can even approximate,\" said the Philharmonic's former acting CEO Deborah   Borda. \"It's like you're sitting in the middle of the orchestra.\"",
      "In the silent film days, live music always accompanied movies, and movies were events.",
      "\"Over the years, theaters got smaller,\" said Steve Linder. \"Then, people started watching it on their television. Then they watch it on their computer. Then they watch that on their phone.\"",
      "Linder is the cofounder of Film Concerts Live, one of several companies that rent out the sheet music and equipment that orchestras need to perform one of these movies. \"What we do is we bring moviegoing back to what it was originally intended to be, with live music, and in a communal experience.\"",
      "But for Borda, one of the best features of live movie scores is the way they attract new and younger audiences to the concert hall. \"Almost 50% of the people who come to our film series are first-time attendees of the New York Philharmonic, and the first time in the hall,\" she said.",
      "For the conductor, these shows are tricky. You have to keep one eye on the musicians, one eye on the score, and one eye on a special monitor running the film. But how does the conductor know exactly when to bring in the orchestra in sync with the action? That's the purpose of moving vertical bars called streamers. Those streamers and the bright dots are like countdowns to important musical moments.",
      "Anthony Parnther conducted the Philharmonic's screenings of \"Jaws.\" But his main gig is conducting the actual Hollywood recording sessions for films, such as \"Oppenheimer,\" \"Avatar: The Way of Water,\" and \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.\"",
      "Asked if there is a feeling among his fellow conductors that such concerts are more crowd-pleasers than art, Parnther replied, \"All I know is that when I turn around from my score to address the audience, every seat is filled.\"",
      "So, how flexible is conducting a score live to a film? \"I have a little bit of license to phrase the orchestra around the streamers,\" Parnther said. \"There could be a little bit of variance. And I think that's what makes these particularly appealing for the musicians to perform and for conductors to conduct.\"",
      "These days, there are over a thousand live-orchestra movie screenings a year. The classic blockbusters usually work best, from \"Jurassic Park\" and \"Superman\" to \"Harry Potter\" and \"The Lord of the Rings.\"",
      "\"It has to be great music that the audience wants to hear, of course,\" said Linder. \"But also it has to be great music that the orchestra is interested in playing.\"",
      "Ryan Roberts is the New York Philharmonic's English horn and oboe player. Unfortunately, during the projection concerts, he sits directly under the screen, so he never gets to see any of the movies, even when he's not playing.",
      "\"But we have a few sneaky ways of watching the movie in the woodwind section,\" Roberts said. His favorite? A rearview mirror he bought on Amazon. \"We tape it right on top of our stand lights.\"",
      "And management approves of this? \"I plead the fifth!\" Roberts laughed.",
      "With the New York Philharmonic performing four performances of four films a year, which all sell out, shouldn't they do 10 performances of each film? Borda said, \"This is a symphony orchestra. We play Mahler. We play Bach. We play Mozart. We have a responsibility to the canon of music. And no, we're not a movie house; we're a symphony orchestra.\"",
      "Well, OK. But even Borda acknowledges that live-orchestra movies have become a popular and important option for American orchestras. \"We should be places that are integrated into the fabric of the community,\" she said. \"And so, we want the New York Philharmonic to be as popular as the New York Yankees or the Mets. And movies can help get us there.\"",

    "title": "Adrien Brody on \"The Brutalist\"",
    "published": "Sun, 05 Jan 2025 10:05:29 -0500",
    "summary": "In the sweeping new period drama, Adrien Brody stars as L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Toth, a Jewish Hungarian architect who survives the horrors of World War II, and seeks to rebuild his career after emigrating to America.",
    "story": [
      "Last month, on a boat called the Manhattan, Adrien Brody and I sailed into New York Harbor.\u00a0 Destination: The Statue of Liberty. He'd been to the landmark before, spending time there with his mother, an immigrant who came to America in 1958.",
      "\"My mother and my grandparents fled Hungary during the revolution,\" Brody said. \"There was so much unknown, and a lot of loss. And all of those sacrifices have kind of laid the foundation for my own existence and what has been accessible to me.\"",
      "Brody's immigrant roots make his latest film, \"The Brutalist,\" a deeply personal one. It's a sweeping, decades-long tale of love, ambition, and a complicated American Dream, all centered around one man, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Toth. \"He's a Jewish Hungarian architect who survives the horrors of World War II, and is forced to toil through poverty and rebuild,\" Brody said.",
      "Toth is hired by a wealthy industrialist to build a massive community center in his \"brutalist\" style \u2013 a form of architecture that's light on decoration and heavy on concrete.",
      "To get Toth just right, Brody drew on his memories of his Hungarian grandfather. \"I remember my grandfather's accent was very, very heavy,\" he said.",
      "\"So, do you hear your grandfather's voice a little bit in this character of L\u00e1szl\u00f3?\" I asked.",
      "\"Oh definitely, yeah, I conjure it up. I also knew every bad word in Hungarian as a kid. So, I infused some of that in it that's not in the script!\"",
      "To watch a trailer for \"The Brutalist\" click on the video player below:",
      "The film's received seven Golden Globe nominations, and Oscar buzz is high. But at three-and-a-half hours, it requires a commitment.",
      "Asked if he was worried about the film's length, Broday replied, \"This is an event. Generations before us, you could expect to see something like this in a theater. But that's becoming much more rare today. I think we all need to be fed nourishing meals! And this is one of them.\"",
      "At 51, Brody's portrayal of a man rebuilding his life after a war makes for a fascinating counterpoint to a role he played more than two decades ago: his Oscar-winning performance of a man enduring the horrors of war in Roman Polanski's \"The Pianist.\"",
      "To play Wladyslaw Szpilman, the real-life pianist who survived the Nazi occupation of Poland, Brody virtually starved himself, losing 30 pounds, all while learning to play the piano.",
      "Learning to play Chopin, he said, quelled his pangs of hunger. \"'Cause it was a kind of meditative, intensely-focused activity where I was memorizing. And I became quite proficient at playing minutes of Chopin's Nocturne and a ballade. And I don't even read music.\"",
      "At 29, he was the youngest man to ever win the Oscar for best actor. The child of an immigrant was living his own American dream.",
      "Adrien Brody was raised in Queens, N.Y. His father, Elliot, is a retired teacher.\u00a0 His mother, Sylvia Plachy, is a photographer. \"As an only child and the son of a photographer, I was her favorite subject,\" he said. \"And so, I had a lens from a very nurturing and ever-present perspective on me. And I think that also helped as a film actor.\"",
      "\"You were comfortable in front of a camera thanks to Mom?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes. Thanks to Mom.\"",
      "He dabbled in magic, calling himself \"The Amazing Adrien,\" but settled on acting by middle school. At 13, he landed a leading role as a rebellious orphan in a made-for-TV movie, \"Home at Last.\" \u00a0\"I remember thinking how I never wanted it to end,\" he said. \"And that sense of joy that I get from it in that immersion, it's never gone away.\"",
      "Brody aged into a mohawked punk rocker in Spike Lee's \"Summer of Sam.\" He's carried a blockbuster like \"King Kong,\" and shown some whimsy in his five films with director Wes Anderson, including \"The Darjeeling Limited\" and \"The French Dispatch.\"",
      "Anderson, said Brody, \"has given me a lot of opportunity to do comedic work, more overtly comedic stuff, which at the time when we started working together, I think people just thought I was a serious actor.\"",
      "\"The Brutalist\" is a return to his serious side, and maybe a reminder that, as an artist, Adrien Brody is up for anything. \"It's a nice moment right now,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"When you're not working, what makes you happy?\"",
      "\"Lots of things. I need to be creatively immersed. So, that may be fulfilled through cooking, through painting, through making music. I'm a pretty good cook.\"",
      "\"What do you make?\"",
      "\"I mean, hot dogs,\" he laughed. \"What do you like? You tell me what would you like? I can whip something up. You can come over one day, come see the artwork. I'll whip up something to eat. I can make some good cocktails.\"",
      "\"You're a mixologist as well?\"",
      "\"Oh, I can hook it up.\"",
      "\"Okay. What can you not do?\"",
      "\"Keep my mouth shut!\" he laughed. \"I need to learn that one!\"",

    "story": [
      "\"I've spent quite a lot of my life over the last 15 years in the really honored, privileged position of being close to people who are reaching the end of their lives,\" said actress Tilda Swinton. \"And then to make a film about it is a blessing on a blessing, really.\"",
      "Drawing on those experiences helped Swinton earn an acting nomination for Sunday's Golden Globes. In \"The Room Next Door,\" she portrays a woman with a terminal cancer diagnosis. Her character, Martha, faces questions about how to live. \"My first 'Martha,' if you like, was Derek Jarman,\" she said. The director, artist and gay activist (who cast Swinton in her first film, \"Caravaggio\"), was diagnosed with HIV in 1986.",
      "The Oscar-winner credits Jarman with finding her a home in cinema, and showing her how collaborative filmmaking could be. They made seven feature films together before his death, in 1994.",
      "She said, \"He modeled a kind of attitude to his dismount that I drew on, like, to my core, for myself, and in fact I have reflected in the portrait of Martha.\"",
      "I asked, \"You think about specific people as you're acting?\"",
      "\"Well, an attitude, yeah, that I've seen played out, that I've witnessed \u2013 my parents, my children's beloved father, John Byrne, who died last year,\" she replied. \"It's been such a privilege to be in that hot seat beside them and seeing them face the inevitable with such dignity and humor and wit, and just power.\"",
      "\"The Room Next Door\" is the first English-language feature film by Spanish director Pedro Almod\u00f3var. Swinton's co-star, Julianne Moore, is another Academy Award-winner. \"He asked me who I wanted,\" said Swinton. \"It was her face that I saw at the end of the bed. It was her listening face that I felt was the right face.\"",
      "To watch a trailer for \"The Room Next Door\" click on the video player below:",
      "Swinton has made more than 80 films, winning an Oscar for the 2007 \"Michael Clayton.\" Still, she says the big studio productions are the exception. She veers toward independent films, thriving in the experimental.",
      "Asked about the expressiveness of her eyes, and of how much she can \"say\" without saying anything, Swinton said, \"I suppose I started in silent cinema with Derek Jarman. I actually prefer silent cinema.\"",
      "Why? \"I loved it first,\" she said. \"And then when I started working with Derek, I found my comfort zone in front of a silent camera. I think it's a very rare screenplay that is able to approach what I'm really interested in, which is inarticulacy. Even now, I sort of know what I want to say to you, but I can't pull the words out my ear, and they're coming out a little wrong.\"",
      "I asked, \"Can you say it with your eyes?\"",
      "\"That's what I'm really interested in!\" she laughed.",
      "She's played a tortured mother in \"We Need to Talk About Kevin,\" and she's not exactly cuddly in the Almod\u00f2var film. But just before our interview, joking about some fabulous boots she was wearing, we glimpsed another side of Swinton.",
      "I asked, \"You've done a lot of films, but you can seem so serious \u2026 Like this? Not at all. There is a curiosity and a warmth, and you jump out.\"",
      "\"The jumping out, I get. The seriousness, I am a little confused by.\"",
      "\"What do you mean?\"",
      "\"I am always doing comedy,\" she said. \"I feel everything I do is funny. But I think maybe because I'm a shy person and I don't tend to smile with my teeth all over the place, there's has been an assumption that there was more seriousness than nonsense, but there is a hell of a lot of nonsense.\"",
      "\"You're a shy person?\"",
      "\"Yeah.\"",
      "\"You picked a tough career for that!\"",
      "\"I know! It's strange, isn't it? But I think what makes me most shy is being singled out.\"",
      "So, when she's alone on the red carpet, she finds that ensemble approach through fashion.\u00a0 \"It's very playful. My relationship with fashion is entirely dependent on my relationship with certain individuals who are my friends, who happen to be some of the greatest designers in the world, who give me clothes. And that makes going out into a public arena when you are someone who is not an extrovert, not only much easier, but actually possible.\"",
      "When we met in Paris. Swinton had just flown in from a trip to China for Chanel. She was wearing a military coat: \"I first fell in love with my father's uniforms. My mother was always in some nice silk dress, but I was really interested in my father's uniform.\"",
      "Swinton grew up the daughter of a military officer in an aristocratic family in Scotland. When we met, Swinton was looking forward to getting home to her remote seaside town in Scotland, where she raised twins, and has an artist-partner, Sandro Kopp, and a number of springer spaniels.",
      "I asked about descriptions of her as \"an icon of androgynous beauty,\" and naturally radiating \"a certain otherworldliness.\"",
      "\"The otherworldliness does make me laugh a bit,\" she said, \"because the truth is I look like the members of my family. I think the otherworldly might have something to do with the fact that I don't wear mascara and I'm very pale. As my grandmother would say, it would be a dull world if everybody felt the same. I don't feel otherworldly. I feel very much present.\"",
      "Swinton is very much present, whether at an interview or as an actor. And in navigating Hollywood, those roots in Scotland help her find balance.",
      "\"Maybe it's made me braver,\" she said. \"Maybe I wouldn't be able to pack that small bag and engage in worlds that are very alien to where I come from, if I didn't know I was going home to something that feels absolutely real to me.\"",

      "A man accused of long hiding a stolen pair of sequined ruby slippers that Judy Garland wore in \"The Wizard of Oz\" plans to plead guilty, his attorney confirmed Friday.",
      "The slippers were stolen in 2005 from the Judy Garland Museum in her hometown of Grand Rapids, Minnesota. Their whereabouts remained a mystery for nearly 13 years until the FBI recovered them in Minneapolis in 2018.",
      "They fetched a record price for movie memorabilia when they were auctioned off for $32.5 million last month, according to Heritage Auctions, which conducted the sale. The buyer still has not been revealed.",
      "Jerry Hal Saliterman, now 77, of Crystal, Minnesota, was charged last March with theft of a major artwork and witness tampering.",
      "He's expected to plead not guilty when he's arraigned Monday before a federal magistrate judge, a formality because magistrate judges can't accept guilty pleas in felony cases in Minnesota. But the district judge overseeing the case on Friday scheduled a change of plea hearing for Jan. 10.",
      "Saliterman's attorney, John C. Brink, confirmed to The Associated Press that his client will change his plea then to guilty, but he declined to give details about any potential plea agreement. The U.S. Attorney's Office for North Dakota, which is prosecuting the case, declined to comment.",
      "The man who stole the slippers, Terry Jon Martin, now 77, pleaded guilty in 2023 to theft of a major artwork, admitting to what his attorney said was an attempt to pull off \"one last score\" after turning from a life of crime. The 76-year-old Grand Rapids man was sentenced to time served, one year of supervised release and $23,000 in restitution to the museum.",
      "The indictment against Saliterman says that from August 2005 to July 2018, he \"received, concealed, and disposed of an object of cultural heritage.\" Saliterman, according to the indictment, knew they were stolen, and that he threatened to release a sex tape of a woman and \"take her down with him\" if she did keep her mouth shut about the slippers.",
      "Saliterman is also in poor health. He was in a wheelchair and on supplemental oxygen last March during his first court appearance.",

Martin, who lives near Grand Rapids, said at his plea hearing in October 2023 that he hoped to sell what he thought were real rubies from the shoes. But a person who deals in stolen goods, known as a fence, informed him the rubies weren't real, he said. Martin said he then got rid of the slippers, but declined to say how he did so.",
      "Garland's character, Dorothy, wore several pairs while filming the classic 1939 musical, but only four pairs are known to remain. Hollywood memorabilia collector Michael Shaw had loaned his pair to the museum before Martin stole them. Shaw eventually got them back, and had them auctioned last month.",

      "What does \"public domain\" mean, exactly?",
      "When a work is in the public domain, it has no copyright protection, meaning anyone can use and build upon it at leisure.",
      "\"No fees, no licenses, no tracking down the person who owns it, no permission,\" Jennifer Jenkins, director of Duke University's Center for the Study of the Public Domain, told CBS News' Lee Cowan in 2024.",
      "How does the public domain work?",
      "Copyright protects an original work for a finite amount of time. When this protection expires, the work enters the public domain. The founding fathers wrote this concept into the U.S. Constitution under the intellectual property clause, intended \"to promote the progress of science and useful arts.\"",
      "However, the laws governing the public domain can be tricky. For example: Although Mickey Mouse returned to the people in 2024, this classification only applied to his first appearance in 1928's \"Steamboat Willie.\" It was not until 1929 that Mickey began wearing white gloves, meaning any public reinterpretation showcasing this characteristic could have been liable for copyright infringement until this year.",
      "When does intellectual property enter the public domain?",
      "In the U.S., the length of copyright protection for a certain property depends on various elements. Generally, for works published or registered before 1978, the term lasts 95 years. For works created after this date, protection typically lasts for the author's life plus 70 years.",
      "\"The public domain doesn't represent the death of copyright,\" said Jenkins. \"It's just the second part of copyright's life cycle.\"",
      "What's entering the public domain in 2026?",
      "2026 will be another exciting year for the public domain with works from 1930 losing their copyright. Protection will run out for the earliest versions of Betty Boop, Mickey Mouse's dog Pluto and his friend Clarabelle Cow, teen detective Nancy Drew, M.C. Escher's \"The Bridge,\" Agatha Christie's Miss Marple and more.",

    "story": [
      "Los Angeles \u2014\u00a0Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have reached a divorce settlement, ending one of the longest and most contentious divorces in Hollywood history but not every legal issue between them.",
      "Jolie and Pitt signed off on a default declaration filed in Los Angeles Superior Court Monday, saying they've entered into a written agreement on their marital and property rights. The filing says they give up the right to any future spousal financial support but gives no other details. A judge will need to sign off on the agreement.",
      "The settlement was first reported by People magazine.",
      "Jolie's lawyer, James Simon, told CBS News in a statement that, \"More than eight years ago, Angelina filed for divorce from Mr. Pitt. She and the children left all of the properties they had shared with Mr. Pitt, and since that time she has focused on finding peace and healing for their family. This is just one part of a long ongoing process that started eight years ago. Frankly, Angelina is exhausted, but she is relieved this one part is over.\"",
      "A representative for Pitt declined to comment to CBS News.",
      "Jolie, 49, and Pitt, 61, were among Hollywood's most prominent pairings for 12 years, two of them as a married couple. The Oscar winners have six children together.",
      "Jolie filed for divorce in 2016, after a private jet flight from Europe during which she said Pitt was abusive toward her and their children. A representative for Pitt, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly, strongly denied Jolie's allegations.",
      "During the long divorce fight, four of the couple's six children became adults, negating the need for a custody agreement for them. The only two who are still minors are 16-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne. In June, one of their daughters, then known as Shiloh Nouvel Jolie-Pitt, successfully petitioned to remove Pitt's name from hers.",
      "Their other children are 23-year-old Maddox, 21-year-old Pax and 19-year-old Zahara.",
      "There have been no official court actions in the case in nearly a year, and no indication that the two had been nearing an agreement.",
      "Some details on their disputes, however, have been revealed through a separate lawsuit filed by Pitt in which he alleged Jolie reneged on an agreement that she would sell him her half of a French winery the two owned together. Jolie instead sold her part of the winery, Chateau Miraval, to the Tenute del Mondo wine group, a subsidiary of the Stoli Group, which Pitt said was a \"vindictive\" move that ruined a private space that had been a second home.",
      "Jolie's attorneys said the winery sale agreement broke down over Pitt's demand that as part of the deal she sign a wide-ranging non-disclosure agreement about him. In court documents, she called that an attempt to cover up his physical abuse of her, which she said turned toward the children on the 2016 flight.",
      "It's not clear how the divorce agreement will affect the winery lawsuit.",
      "Publicly, both Pitt and Jolie have been extremely tight-lipped on everything surrounding their split, despite robust promotional tours and many media appearances for various projects.",
      "Pitt said in a 2017 interview with GQ that he had had a drinking problem at the time of the plane incident and the split, but had since become sober and was going to therapy. He has not defended his behavior on the family flight.",
      "Jolie has also declined to make any public statements about the family issues or the divorce, though she has sought a broader examination and airing of his behavior by the courts in both the divorce and winery cases.",
      "Both Jolie and Pitt were among the most elite stars in film when they began dating in 2004, after co-starring as hitman-and-hitwoman spouses in \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith,\" and remained atop the Hollywood A-list throughout their coupling. The daughter of Hollywood luminary Jon Voight and the star of \"Maleficent\" and \"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider,\" Jolie won an Oscar for her performance in 1999's \"Girl, Interrupted.\"",

      "This season's wave of flu cases is arriving later than it has in the past two years. After the COVID-19 pandemic, annual waves of influenza during the colder months increased weeks earlier than they had during many pre-pandemic seasons.",
      "This year, flu trends look to be closely in line with the 2019 to 2020 season, which also reached peak levels around the New Year.",
      "Some of the highest levels of influenza are now in Western states, several of which have already topped the peaks recorded during the worst of last winter's flu season.",
      "In Oregon, the CDC's data show 8.4% of emergency room visits involved flu at the end of December. This is now more than three times higher than the peak reached last season.",
      "\"You can see that in Dec. 2022, we also had a very large spike in flu cases, but this year has been significantly higher than last year,\" said Sara Hottman, a spokesperson for Oregon Health & Science University Hospital, in an email.",
      "According to figures shared by Hottman for the hospital and the other health care facilities in their system, 1,101 cases of influenza were treated in November and December of 2024, up from 251 cases during the same months in 2023.",

      "Updated CDC modeling published over Christmas estimated that this winter's COVID-19 wave is also not expected to be as large as some previous winter surges, in part given the lack so far of a \"new immune-escape variant\" of the virus.",
      "The CDC last estimated that most COVID infections are from the XEC variant, which officials have said is closely related to previous strains. The LP.8.1 strain that variant trackers have been closely monitoring still made up less than 1 in 10 cases.",
      "The latest data from CDC's wastewater surveillance suggests that COVID-19 levels have only recently crossed from \"moderate\" to \"high\" levels nationwide.",

    "story": [
      "The Biden administration's move on Friday to\u00a0block Nippon Steel's proposed purchase\u00a0of U.S. Steel raises questions about the once iconic American company's future, with industry sources saying the manufacturer could struggle to energize growth or attract rival acquisition bids.",
      "President Biden stopped the $15 billion deal over national security and supply-chain concerns.",
      "U.S. Steel CEO David B. Burritt blasted the decision, calling Mr. Biden's action \"shameful\" and \"corrupt\" in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"He gave a political payback to a union boss out of touch with his members while harming our company's future, our workers and our national security. He insulted Japan, a vital economic and national security ally, and put American competitiveness at risk,\" Burritt said.",
      "Burritt added that the proposed deal \"is what guarantees a great future for U. S. Steel, our employees, our communities and our country.\"",
      "Limited options",

      "\"With foreign ownership seemingly off the table, we see limited avenues moving forward,\" Bill Peterson, metals and mining analyst for JPMorgan said in a research note.",
      "U.S. Steel leaders had warned that without an infusion of capital from Nippon Steel, it would be forced to curtail its legacy blast furnace investments and shift to cheaper nonunion electric arc furnaces. Additionally, executives said U.S. Steel could move its headquarters out of Pittsburgh.",
      "The company could still entertain bids from domestic rivals, said Peterson, noting that U.S. Steel's mini-mill assets could be attractive to peers like steel products company Nucor Group, which considered buying parts of U.S. Steel before dropping out over price concerns.",
      "Others see rival bids as unlikely.",
      "\"No one was ready to follow Nippon Steel and Cliffs above [$50 per share] a year ago,\" BNP Paribas analysts said in a report, referring to Nippon Steel's $55 a share offer, which offered a hefty premium to U.S. Steel shareholders. \"Cliffs no longer has enough firepower while foreign interested parties are now likely to stay well put given the backlash Nippon Steel had to face.\"",
      "Should U.S. Steel choose continue to operate as an independent company, it could focus on growing its Big River steel plant in Arkansas, which it acquired in 2021 and which produces 70% to 80% fewer emissions than typical steel-making processes, according to JPMorgan analysts. In that scenario, the company could simultaneously trim its legacy blast furnace assets over time, they said.",

      "U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel are expected to challenge the Biden administration's ruling, but face an uphill battle.",
      "\"The president's statement and order do not present any credible evidence of a national security issue, making clear that this was a political decision,\" the companies\u00a0said\u00a0in a joint statement Friday. \"Following President Biden's decision, we are left with no choice but to take all appropriate action to protect our legal rights.\"",
      "The companies added that the transaction would \"revitalize communities\" that rely on the steel industry, provide steelworkers with job security and improve the American steel supply chain.",
      "Nippon Steel has proposed investing $3 billion in U.S. Steel under the deal.",
      "\"Blocking this transaction means denying billions of committed investment to extend the life of U. S. Steel's aging facilities and putting thousands of good-paying, family-sustaining union jobs at risk,\" the companies said in their statement.",
      "By contrast. the United Steelworkers, the union representing 850,000 workers, cheered the administration's move.",
      "\"It's clear from U.S. Steel's recent financial performance that it can easily remain a strong and resilient company. We now call on U.S. Steel's board of directors to take the necessary steps to allow it to further flourish and remain profitable,\" the union said in\u00a0 a statement.",
      "In December, U.S. Steel\u00a0said\u00a0it expected fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of roughly $150 million, undershooting Wall Street forecasts of nearly $262 million. The company reported third-quarter net earnings of $119 million, down from $299 million in the year-ago period. The company's annual revenues, which approached $24 billion in 2008, had slipped to $18 billion by 2023, highlighting its struggle to boost sales.",
      "U.S. Steel shares fell 6.5% on the day to $30.47 and are down 36% from the same period last year.",
      "Antitrust concerns",
      "Even if another domestic rival like Nucor Corporation or Cleveland-Cliffs expressed interest in acquiring some or all of U.S. Steel, antitrust concerns could quash possible transactions.",
      "\"I think they have Federal Trade Commission issues in terms of monopolistic practices when it comes to companies merging,\" said corporate adviser Jay McDonald.",
      "Jeremy Flack, CEO of Flack Global Metal Supply, a midsize metal supplier and a U.S. Steel client, echoed that concern.",

      "President Biden announced Friday that he is blocking the $15 billion proposal by Japan's Nippon Steel to buy U.S. Steel after a government panel recently failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of the deal.",
      "Mr. Biden said his decision is aimed at protecting the nation's security and infrastructure, as well as supply chain resiliency.

The interagency committee, chaired by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, reviews such deals with an eye toward potential national security risks, and can block sales or force changes in the terms to protect national security. CFIUS said on Dec. 23 that it was unable to reach a consensus on the deal, leaving it to Mr. Biden.",
      "\"It is my solemn responsibility as president to ensure that, now and long into the future, America has a strong domestically owned and operated steel industry that can continue to power our national sources of strength at home and abroad; and it is a fulfillment of that responsibility to block foreign ownership of this vital American company,\" the president said in a statement Friday announcing his decision to block the deal. \"U.S. Steel will remain a proud American company \u2014 one that's American-owned, American-operated, by American union steelworkers \u2014 the best in the world.\"",
      "An accompanying order prohibiting the proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel signed by Mr. Biden said there is \"credible evidence\" that Nippon Steel \"might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.\"",

Steel, which reflects a clear violation of due process and the law governing CFIUS,\" the companies said. \"Instead of abiding by the law, the process was manipulated to advance President Biden's political agenda. The president's statement and Order do not present any credible evidence of a national security issue, making clear that this was a political decision.\"",
      "They argued the record before CIFIUS shows the acquisition would strengthen national security and claimed the committee's process was infected by politics.",
      "\"It is shocking \u2014 and deeply troubling \u2014 that the U.S. government would reject a procompetitive transaction that advances U.S. interests and treat an ally like Japan in this way,\" the two companies said. \"Unfortunately, it sends a chilling message to any company based in a U.S. allied country contemplating significant investment in the United States.\"",

      "\"He gave a political payback to a union boss out of touch with his members while harming our company's future, our workers, and our national security,\" Burritt said. \"He insulted Japan, a vital economic and national security ally, and put American competitiveness at risk.\"",
      "Mr. Biden, backed by the United Steelworkers, said earlier this year that it was \"vital for (U.S. Steel) to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.\"",
      "But a U.S. official familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the private report, said some federal agencies represented on the panel were skeptical that allowing a Japanese company to buy an American-owned steelmaker would create national security risks.",

      "On Tuesday, Nippon Steel, which is headquartered in Japan, proposed giving the U.S. government direct veto authority over any changes to U.S. Steel's production capacity. The proposal represented a minor change to a recommendation from CFIUS that was intended to allay concerns that Nippon Steel's proposed purchase of U.S. Steel could lead to a decline in domestic steel output and a reduction in its U.S. workforce.",
      "Both Mr. Biden and President-elect Donald Trump courted unionized workers at U.S. Steel during the presidential campaign and vowed to block the acquisition amid concerns about foreign ownership of a flagship American company. However, the appeal of Nippon Steel's acquisition was that it has the financial resources to invest in the mills and upgrade them, possibly helping to preserve steel production within the U.S.",
      "Trump also opposed the acquisition and vowed in a Truth Social post earlier this month to \"block this deal from happening.\" Trump proposed to revive U.S. Steel's flagging fortunes \"through a series of Tax Incentives and Tariffs.\"",

      "In the face of political opposition, Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel waged a public relations campaign to win over skeptics. U.S. Steel said in a statement Monday, Dec. 23, that the deal was \"the best way, by far, to ensure that U.S. Steel, including its employees, communities, and customers, will thrive well into the future.\"",
      "A growing number of conservatives had publicly backed the deal, as Nippon Steel began to win over some steelworkers union members and local officials around its blast furnaces in Pennsylvania and Indiana.

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 14:36:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Apple will pay $95 million to settle allegations that its Siri virtual assistant violated people's privacy by eavesdropping on mobile device users.",
    "story": [
      "Apple has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit that accused the company of turning its virtual assistant Siri into a snoop that eavesdropped on the users of iPhones and other trendy devices in a betrayal to its long-standing commitment to personal privacy.",
      "The proposed settlement filed in federal court earlier this week still needs to be approved by a judge, but here are a few things to know about the case and the privacy issues that it raised.",
      "What was the lawsuit about?",
      "The Wood Law Firm, which specializes in class-action lawsuits, filed the complaint against Apple in August 2019, shortly after The Guardian newspaper published an article alleging that Siri's microphone had been surreptitiously turned on to record conversations occurring without the users' knowledge.",
      "Apple issued a September 2014 software update that was supposed to activate the virtual assistant only with the triggering words \"Hey, Siri,\" but The Guardian story alleged Siri was listening and recording conversations at other times to help improve the company's technology.",
      "The story led to the lawsuit, which later raised allegations that Apple shared some of the conversations that Siri secretly recorded with advertisers looking to connect with consumers who were more likely to buy their products and services.",
      "How many people are covered by the settlement",
      "Tens of millions of U.S consumers who owned or purchased iPhones and other devices equipped with Siri from September 17, 2014, through the end of last year will be eligible to file claims.",
      "How much money will eligible consumers get?",
      "It's far too early to tell for certain, but the settlement currently envisions paying out up to $20 per Siri-enabled device, with each consumer limited to a maximum. The final amount could be affected by two factors \u2014 the number of claims and how much of the settlement fund is reduced to cover legal fees and costs.",
      "A claims administrator estimates only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers will file claims. The lawyers in the case currently are seeking nearly $30 million in fees and expenses, but that figure could still be lowered by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White, who is overseeing the case in Oakland, California. A proposed Feb. 14 court hearing has been proposed to review the settlement terms.",
      "Did Apple break any laws?",
      "If the allegations were true, Apple may have violated federal wiretapping laws and other statutes designed to protect people's privacy. But Apple adamantly denied any wrongdoing and maintained that it would have been cleared of any misconduct had the case gone to trial.",
      "The company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.",
      "Lawyers representing the consumers asserted that Apple's misbehavior was so egregious that the company could have been liable for $1.5 billion in damages if it lost the case.",
      "Although Apple hasn't explained the reasons for making the settlement, major companies often decide it makes more sense to resolve class-action cases rather than to continue to run up legal costs and risk the chance of potentially bad publicity. The lawsuit also targeted one of Apple's core values framing privacy as a \"fundamental human right.\"",
      "Although $95 million sounds like a lot of money, it's a pittance for Apple. Since September 2014, the company's total profits have exceeded $700 billion \u2014 a streak of prosperity that has helped propel the company's market value to about $3.7 trillion.",
      "Should I be worried about microphones on other devices being used to spy on me?",
      "Perhaps. A case similar to the one filed against Siri is still active in a San Jose, California, federal court against Google and the virtual assistant in its Android software, which has been widely used in smartphones for years.",
      "How do I disable Siri?",
      "You can turn Apple's virtual assistant off by following these simple steps:",
      "1. Navigate to Settings Siri & Search.",
      "2. Toggle off Listen for 'Hey Siri' and press the Side button for Siri.",
      "3. Tap Turn Off Siri when a pop-up window appears.",
      "You can also disable individual apps' access to your iPhone's mic by doing the following: Navigate to Settings (select the app) then toggle off Microphone.",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 14:09:23 -0500",
    "summary": "JetBlue is the first carrier to be penalized by the Department of Transportation for unrealistic scheduling practice.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation on Friday announced a $2 million fine against JetBlue for \"operating multiple chronically delayed flights,\" marking the first such penalty by the federal agency.",
      "Airlines are prohibited from offering unrealistic schedules that don't reflect actual flight departure and arrival times, yet an investigation by the DOT found that JetBlue operated four chronically delayed flights at least 145 times between June 2022 through November 2023, according to the DOT.",
      "Each flight was chronically delayed for five consecutive months or more. Despite DOT warning JetBlue about inaccurate flight departure and arrival times on its flight between John F. Kennedy International Airport and Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina, the airline continued to operate three more repeatedly delayed flights between Fort Lauderdale and Orlando, Florida and JFK; and between Fort Lauderdale and Windsor Locks, Connecticut, the agency said.",
      "There were 395 delays and cancellations across these four chronically delayed flights in total, and the DOT's investigation found\u00a0 JetBlue responsible for more than 70% of its chronically delayed flights.",
      "JetBlue said it had invested tens of millions of dollars to reduce flight delays over the past two years, and had seen significant improvements in 2024.",
      "\"While we've reached a settlement to resolve this matter regarding four flights in 2022 and 2023, we believe accountability for reliable air travel equally lies with the U.S. government, which operates our nation's air traffic control system,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "Consumers advocates applauded the government's move to penalize JetBlue.",
      "\"Airlines often don't allow enough time between flights and they often allow for no margin for error,\" Teresa Murray, consumer watchdog director at U.S. Public Interest Research Group Education Fund, said in a statement. \"They often treat travelers like seat numbers, not people who have lives and commitments and plans for everything from vacations to weddings or funerals.\"",
      "What counts as a chronic delay?",
      "The agency has ongoing investigations into other airlines for unrealistic flight schedules that do not reflect actual departure and arrival times. A flight is considered chronically delayed if it is flown at least 10 times a month and arrives more than 30 minutes late more than 50% of the time, with cancellations included as delays, it stated.",
      "The penalty comes as the Biden administration winds down, leaving uncertain how the incoming Trump regime will tackle transportation issues. Under Biden, transportation regulators have taken a series of actions to safeguard airline passengers, including passing rules that now provide automatic refunds when flights are significantly delayed or canceled.",
      "\"Illegal chronic flight delays make flying unreliable for travelers. Today's action puts the entire airline industry on notice that we expect their flight schedules to reflect reality,\" U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement. \"The department will enforce the law against airlines with chronic delays or other unrealistic scheduling practices in order to protect healthy competition in commercial aviation and ensure passengers are treated fairly.\"",
      "Passengers getting money",
      "JetBlue must pay half the penalty in cash to the U.S. Treasury, with the other $1 million going to compensate JetBlue passengers harmed by the delayed flights or any future disruptions caused by JetBlue within the next year. The future compensation must be a minimum of $75 for each affected passenger.",
      "JetBlue had one of the poorest on-time performances last year among the U.S. airlines, according to a ranking by Cirium. The aviation analytics firm found that less than 75% of JetBlue's flights arrived on schedule, putting the airline behind all the major domestic carriers, including some of its low-cost rivals. Only Frontier Airlines had a worse showing in the U.S., Cirium said in a\u00a0report published Thursday.",

      "Authorities are looking into several parallels between the incidents, including that both involved trucks \u2014 a Ford pickup in New Orleans and Tesla Cybertruck in Las Vegas \u2014 were rented from Turo and occurred on New Year's Day. Both also involved U.S.-born military servicemen who served in Afghanistan around the same timeframe, but don't appear to have any known connections.",
      "But on Thursday, an FBI official, Christopher Raia, said that at this point, there's \"no definitive link\" between the two occurrences.",
      "In an email to CBS News, a Turo spokesperson said the company is \"actively partnering with law enforcement authorities as they investigate both incidents.\"",
      "Turo CEO Andre Haddad released a statement on Friday detailing the company's ongoing cooperation with authorities. \"We've spent these tense, mournful hours investigating, partnering with law enforcement, and working around the clock to figure out how our platform could be misused by the perpetrators of such atrocities,\" the CEO said.",
      "According to the 12-year-old company, out of its entire history of rentals \u2014 which includes 27 million bookings spanning 8.6 billion miles driven \u2014 less than .10% have ended in a \"serious incident, such as a vehicle theft.\"",
      "\"Despite this strong track record, and as an immediate next step while we wait for law enforcement to conclude their investigations, we're consulting with national security and counterterrorism experts to learn more about how we can get even better and play our part in helping prevent anything like this from happening ever again,\" Haddad said.",
      "They added, \"We do not believe that either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat.\"",
      "Turo operates similarly to Airbnb, but with cars instead of houses or apartments. Car owners who aren't using their vehicles can rent them out to others via the app, which handles screening, billing and other services. In some cases, individuals have become \"professional hosts\" by renting out fleets of cars via Turo, according to a company filing.",
      "In a separate email to CBS MoneyWatch, a Turo spokesperson said, \"We are outraged by the misuse of our marketplace by the two individuals who perpetrated these acts.\"",
      "Here's what to know about Turo.",
      "How many people use Turo?",
      "Turo, which started in 2009, had about 150,000 active hosts who rented out about 350,000 vehicles as of Sept. 30, according to the company's filing. About 3.5 million people rented those cars in the 12-month period through the end of September, it added.",
      "The car rental service operates in 16,000 cities in the U.S., Australia, France, the U.K. and Canada.",
      "How do you rent a car on Turo?",
      "Turo says that in order to use its service, individuals need an email address, Google account or Apple ID, and a valid driver's license. Renters must also provide a home address and payment card.",
      "Customers must be at least 18 years old to rent a car on Turo, or over 25 for more expensive vehicles. For instance, to rent a \"deluxe\" car \u2014 those valued between $45,000 to $85,000 \u2014 drivers must be older than 25. \"Super deluxe\" cars, or those valued over $85,000, are limited to people over 30.",
      "Does Turo screen people who rent cars?",
      "On its website, Turo says \"We may ask for additional photos and information and/or may check your personal and/or business credit report, auto insurance score, and criminal background to verify your account.\"",
      "The man who drove the Ford truck into a crowd on Bourbon Street in New Orleans, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, had pleaded guilty in 2015 to charges tied to driving under the influence (DUI), according to CNN.",
      "In the state of Louisiana, a DUI offense is considered a felony on third and subsequent convictions,\u00a0according to Louisiana Court Records, although first-time DUI offenders can face felony charges in instances where a death or violation of child endangerment laws is involved.",
      "Turo also says it relies on its proprietary \"risk score\" to assess potential renters, which relies on \"more than 50 data inputs,\" such as information submitted by customers as well as parameters set by the car owner.",
      "\"Every Turo renter is screened through a proprietary multilayer, data science-based trust and safety process,\" the Turo spokesperson wrote to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"These individuals in question had valid driver's licenses, clean background checks, and were honorably discharged from the U.S. military,\" the spokesperson added. \"They could have boarded any plane, checked into a hotel, or rented a car or truck from a traditional vehicle rental chain. We do not believe these two individuals would have been flagged by anyone \u2014 including Big Rental or law enforcement.\"",
      "In a separate statement Thursday, Turo CEO Haddad also said the company is consulting with national security and counterterrorism experts to \"learn more about how we can get even better and play our part in helping prevent anything like this from happening ever again.\"",
      "Who are the men who rented the cars used in the attacks?",
      "The driver in the New Orleans attack, Jabbar, a 42-year-old U.S.-born citizen from Texas, was a U.S. Army veteran who lived in Houston. The FBI said he posted several videos before the attack proclaiming his support for ISIS.",
      "Jabbar rented a Ford electric pickup truck from Turo in Houston on Dec. 30, 2024, and drove the vehicle to New Orleans on Dec. 31. On Jan. 1, he bypassed barriers put in place on Bourbon Street, which included patrol cars and law enforcement, before plowing onto the sidewalk, according to police officials. The attack killed at least 14 people and injured dozens.",
      "In the second Jan. 1 occurrence, Matthew Alan Livelsberger, an active-duty U.S. Army Special Forces intelligence sergeant who was serving in Germany but on leave in Colorado at the time of the incident, rented a Tesla Cybertruck from Turo in Denver.",
      "That Cybertruck, a 2024 model, pulled up to the Trump hotel's glass entrance doors on Wednesday morning, officials said. Smoke began emerging from the vehicle, and then a large explosion occurred. Gasoline and camp fuel canisters and large firework mortars were found in the back of the vehicle after the explosion, which occurred about 15 seconds after the vehicle pulled in front of the building.",
      "The Cybertruck explosion, which is being investigated as a possible act of terrorism, killed the driver of the car and injured seven people outside of the vehicle.",
      "The body was \"burnt beyond recognition,\" Sheriff Kevin McMahill of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said in a briefing Thursday, but the coroner's office later confirmed it was Livelsberger.

      "Mortgage rates around the U.S. have remained high despite the Fed's three rate cuts, which have lowered the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 by one percentage point.",
      "Despite that step-down, mortgage costs haven't seen a commensurate decline. The typical rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is now about 0.3 percentage points higher than it was in January 2024, when it stood at about 6.6%, according to Freddie Mac data.",
      "Mortgage rates haven't dipped along with the Fed's cuts because they're based on several factors besides the central bank's benchmark rate. Those issues include the strength of the U.S. economy and changes in the yield for the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond, and experts now say home buyers might not see significant relief in 2025.",
      "\"Continued economic growth and worries about inflation and government debt will keep mortgage rates elevated,\" McBride wrote.",
      "Mortgage rates could end 2025 at 6.5%, he predicted.",
      "That jibes with a forecast from Lawrence Yun, the chief economist of the National Association of Realtors, who told CBS MoneyWatch in November that the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is likely to hover around 6.5% for much of 2025, although rates might bounce around between 6% and 7% over the course of the year.",
      "Will credit card rates fall in 2025?",
      "Credit card rates will likely decline along with additional Fed cuts in 2025, but people with revolving balances are still going to be paying high fees. It could also take up to three months for rate cuts to result in lower card APRs, McBride noted.",
      "He expects the typical credit card to charge about 19.8% by the end of 2025. Currently, the average APR for new card offers is about 24.4%, according to LendingTree.",
      "How will rates on CDs and savings account change in 2025?",
      "One bright spot during the Fed's regime of interest-rate hikes was that it boosted returns for savers, who could earn healthy returns on their money held in savings accounts, CDs and money market accounts.",
      "Rates for these products will likely decrease if the Fed makes additional rate cuts in 2025, as they did after the central bank cut rates in late 2024. But shopping around could help savers find better deals, McBride said.",
      "For instance, he predicted the national average for savings accounts will be 0.35% at the end of 2025, but top-yielding offers could stand at 3.8% by year-end. Top-yielding 1-year CDs could pay about 3.7%, while five-year CDs may pay 3.95% by the end of 2025, McBride forecast.",

    "summary": "The explosion outside the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas on New Year's Day is being investigated as a possible act of terrorism, sources said.",
    "story": [
      "A Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas early Wednesday, killing one person, in an incident that is being investigated as a possible act of terrorism, according to law enforcement.",
      "Investigators do not believe there's \"any other danger to the community right now,\" FBI agent Jeremy Schwartz said at a news conference Wednesday evening.",
      "The sole person inside the vehicle died, and seven people suffered minor injuries, Sheriff Kevin McMahill of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said. He called the explosion \"an isolated incident\" and said there is no indication that it was linked to ISIS.",
      "Law enforcement sources told CBS News that the Cybertruck was rented to Matthew Alan Livelsberger, 37, an active duty U.S. Army Special Forces intelligence sergeant, who was serving in Germany but was on leave in Colorado at the time of the incident.",
      "Las Vegas Police said the Clark County Coroner confirmed Thursday that Livelsberger had been identified as the driver of the vehicle in the explosion. The cause of death was a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the coroner's office said.",
      "At a briefing earlier Thursday, the FBI said their investigation determined the driver had shot himself in the head before the vehicle detonated, and a gun was found at his feet.",
      "They said they considered Livelsberger the subject of the investigation, but needed a dental or DNA match for identification since the body was burned beyond recognition. They said his military ID, passport and credit cards were found in the vehicle, along with several firearms.",
      "\"I'm comfortable calling it a suicide,\" McMahill said at the briefing.",
      "CBS News spoke to two relatives of Livelsberger who were unaware of any involvement in the incident, but who confirmed he had rented a Cybertruck. One relative told CBS News that Livelsberger's wife had not heard from him in several days.",
      "Federal agents have been at his townhome in Colorado Springs since Wednesday evening and said the activity is related to the explosion in Las Vegas, CBS Colorado reported. No one has been evacuated during the investigation there.",
      "According to CBS News' conversations with his father, Livelsberger was based at Fort Carson but had been serving in Germany. His father said he works with drones. He attended Bucyrus High School in Ohio and enlisted in the Army in 2006. His father said they last spoke on Christmas Day and described everything as normal, emphasizing that Matthew was a devoted father.",
      "Law enforcement officials said Thursday there were no other subjects of the investigation at this time.",
      "Schwartz also noted, \"We do not believe that there's a bunch of folks out there supporting this or helping this.\"",
      "A short time after the Cybertruck, a 2024 model that had been rented in Colorado, pulled up to the hotel's glass entrance doors, smoke began emerging from the vehicle, and then a large explosion occurred.",
      "Several videos posted on social media showed the blast and the Cybertruck engulfed in flames.",
      "McMahill said gasoline canisters, camp fuel canisters and large firework mortars were found in the back of the vehicle after the explosion, which occurred about 15 seconds after the vehicle pulled in front of the building. It's still unclear how the explosives were ignited, he said.",
      "The sheriff said the Cybertruck arrived in Las Vegas at about 7:30 a.m. Wednesday morning and drove through the Strip before approaching the hotel.",
      "Las Vegas Mayor Shelley Berkley\u00a0said police and city marshals \"will remain on extra alert,\" and told people to expect \"a significant officer presence on the Strip, in the downtown and throughout the valley for the next 2 days.\"",
      "The explosion occurred hours after a deadly\u00a0New Orleans attack, when a man intentionally drove a pickup truck into a crowd of revelers on Bourbon Street, killing at least 14 people. The driver was killed in a shootout with police. The FBI said \"weapons and a potential IED,\" or improvised explosive device, were found in his vehicle, which was flying an ISIS flag.",
      "But on Thursday, Christopher Raia, deputy assistant director of the FBI's counterintelligence division, said, \"At this point there is no definitive link between the attack here in New Orleans and the one in Las Vegas.\"",
      "Authorities were looking into several odd similarities between the incidents in the two cities. In addition to their timing on New Year's Day, both incidents involved trucks rented from the carsharing app Turo. Both involved U.S.-born military servicemen who served in Afghanistan around the same timeframe. But two U.S. officials say the military has not yet found any overlap between them at either Fort Bragg or in Afghanistan. They both served there, these officials say, but not at the same time.",
      "President Biden said Wednesday evening that law enforcement and the intelligence community are investigating whether the Las Vegas blast has any possible connection with the New Orleans attack, but \"thus far there's nothing to report.\"",
      "In a statement, a Turo spokesperson said: \"We are actively partnering with law enforcement authorities as they investigate both incidents. We do not believe that either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat.\"",
      "In the past year, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has become a major donor and close adviser to Trump, with the billionaire\u00a0tasked to head up\u00a0Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Musk, along with his co-leader of DOGE, Vivek Ramaswamy, are aiming to cut billions in federal spending.",
      "\"[O]bviously a Cybertruck, the Trump Hotel \u2014 there's lots of questions that we have to answer as we move forward with that,\" McMahill said.",
      "Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In a post on X, Musk said \"The whole Tesla senior team is investigating this matter right now.   Will post more information as soon as we learn anything.  We've never seen anything like this.\"",
      "In another post a few hours later, he said the blast \"was caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck and is unrelated to the vehicle itself.\"",
      "Evacuation at Trump Las Vegas hotel",
      "A county spokeswoman said in a statement that the fire in the valet area of the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas was reported at 8:40 a.m. Details about the incident were initially sketchy.",
      "\"I know you have a lot of questions,\" Jeremy Schwartz, acting FBI Special Agent in Charge for the Las Vegas office, said at the news conference. \"We don't have a lot of answers.\"",
      "Eric Trump, one of the president-elect's sons, posted about the fire on X,\u00a0saying\u00a0that an \"electric vehicle fire occurred in the porte coch\u00e8re of Trump Las Vegas.\"",
      "Officials urged people to stay away from the area around the Trump Las Vegas hotel, which was evacuated. The 64-story hotel is just off the famed Las Vegas Strip and across the street from the Fashion Show Las Vegas shopping mall.",
      "Tesla introduced its steel-clad, futuristic-looking Cybertruck in 2023, with Musk at the time touting the vehicle's bullet-proof windows. The all-wheel Cybertruck ranges in price from about $80,000 to $100,000.",

    "story": [
      "China on Thursday said it was adding dozens of American companies to its export control list to \"safeguard national security and interests.\"",
      "China's Ministry of Commerce said it would impose measures on 28 U.S. entities and would also prohibit exports of dual-use items to the listed companies starting on Thursday, reported the Global Times, a Chinese daily viewed as aligned with Beijing, and the government-run Xinhua news agency. Dual-use items refers to those that can be used for either civilian or military purposes.",
      "China also sanctioned 10 defense firms on Thursday over military sales to Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims as its own, adding them to China's \"Unreliable Entities List,\" the ministry said, according to AFP.",
      "\"It really does seem to be a warning shot \u2014 that escalation in U.S. policies against China, particularly under Trump, will be met with a more aggressive response,\" Jesse Schreger, an associate professor of Macroeconomics at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"China is signaling it will not take tariffs passively.\"",
      "The threat to not sell dual-use goods to listed companies could be consequential, given China's role as the world's manufacturing powerhouse, said Schreger. Unclear is how China intends to enforce the measures and which products will be viewed as dual use and therefore have their sales restricted. Tires, for instance, could be viewed as produced for both civilian and military use, he noted.",
      "The moves come as Beijing readies for the return of President-elect Donald Trump to the White House and after the Biden administration broadened its restrictions on Chinese firms amid an escalating back-and-forth. During his presidential campaign, Trump also raised the idea of imposing a\u00a0tariff of up to 60%\u00a0on all Chinese goods.",
      "\"The desire to put high tariffs on China seems credible, if you think back to the first Trump administration and its willingness to use [tariffs] for geopolitical ends,\" offered Schreger. \"The Biden administration didn't undo that \u2014 in fact, they professionalized it. The Trump administration's rhetoric might have been stronger, but the Biden administration took this economic battle to the next level.\"",
      "China last month said it was investigating U.S. microchip maker Nvidia over potential violations of Chinese anti-monopoly laws.",
      "China's action comes less than a week after it\u00a0placed\u00a0sanctions on seven companies in responding to recently announced U.S. military sales and aid to Taiwan.",
      "Still, sanctions by Beijing targeting American defense companies tend to have a muted impact given that U.S. military firms don't sell arms or related goods to China. The tit-for-tat trade measures also could be limited, some analysts think.",
      "\"Changes to immigration, trade and fiscal policy under the second Trump administration will likely be meaningful but stop short of some of the more dramatic proposals,\" stated Goldman Sachs analysts in a recent report. \"We expect tariffs on imports from China and autos, but not a universal tariff, which would carry economic and political risks that we think the White House will prefer to avoid.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 16:48:21 -0500",
    "summary": "Luma, a private company that distributes electricity in Puerto Rico, has blamed previous \"financial mismanagement\" for problems with the island's grid.",
    "story": [
      "A massive power outage\u00a0blanketed most of Puerto Rico\u00a0early Tuesday, leaving more than 1.2 million people without electricity. Here's what to know about the blackout and Luma Energy, which handles distribution and transmission of electricity on the island.",
      "What caused the blackout?",
      "Luma Energy said in a statement that it is investigating the cause of the outage, which closed many businesses and forced government agencies to limit their hours. But Luma noted that preliminary findings point to problems with an underground power line.",
      "How soon will power be restored in Puerto Rico?",
      "Luma said in a statement early Tuesday that it would likely take 24-28 hours to restore electricity across Puerto Rico.",
      "Later the company said service had resumed in some areas, including the Municipal Hospital of San Juan, but it didn't disclose how many people still lacked power.",
      "Puerto Rico's main airport, the Aeropuerto Internacional Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn, said Tuesday on social media that it had activated backup power generators and was operating normally.",
      "What is Luma?",
      "Luma is a private Canadian-American company, based in San Juan, Puerto Rico, that operates and manages the electric power infrastructure in Puerto Rico.",
      "In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, which\u00a0devastated the U.S. territory\u00a0in September of 2017, the Puerto Rico government in 2021 hired Luma to handle the transmission and distribution of electricity on the island. Power was previously overseen by the state-owned Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), which went\u00a0bankrupt in 2017\u00a0as the government faced billions of dollars in public debt payments.",
      "Luma CEO Juan Saca, a veteran telecom industry executive who was appointed to lead the company in 2023, said in a Sept. 26 hearing before a House panel that Luma has made significant investments to improve Puerto Rico's grid. That includes installing more than 17,850 hurricane-proof utility poles, adding thousands of automation devices aimed at softening the impact of power outages, and clearing vegetation around the island that can impede maintenance.",
      "\"The impact of this has been real. Over the last year, more than 95% of customers had concurrent service more than 98% of the time when generation was available,\" he told lawmakers.",
      "But Saca also sought to deflect criticism that Puerto Rico's electricity system remains unreliable, pointing to previous \"financial mismanagement.\" PREPA's bankruptcy seven years ago has also hindered progress in strengthening and modernizing the island's grid, he said.",
      "Have Puerto Ricans faced previous power outages?",
      "Puerto Rico's electric grid was troubled even before Maria, a consequence of inadequate maintenance and years of underinvestment. But the Category 4 storm crippled the system: Seven years after Maria, chronic power outages and high electricity costs are common in Puerto Rico.",
      "In June, to cite one recent example, a power outage plunged more than 340,000 Puerto Ricans into darkness after two power plants on the island shut down.",
      "\"They're part of my everyday life,\" Enid N\u00fa\u00f1ez, 49, who said she ate breakfast before work thanks to a small gas stove she bought for such events, told the Associated Press. Ra\u00fal Pacheco, a 63-year-old diabetic struggling with an injured foot, said he planned to sleep on his balcony during the outage.",
      "Antonio Torres Miranda, associate commissioner of Puerto Rico's energy agency, said in the House hearing this fall that the island's power distribution and transmission systems have made progress but remain subpar.",
      "\"The recent outage events of June 2024, which affected over 300,000 customers, serve as a stark reminder of the fragility of our infrastructure and the urgent need for comprehensive improvements,\" he said. \"These incidents highlight the complex interplay of aging assets, deferred maintenance and the increasing impacts of climate change on our island's power grid.\"",
      "Some critics are blunter in their assessment of Luma's record in Puerto Rico.",
      "\"Almost 25 years into the 21st century, it is ridiculous that Puerto Rico's power grid has failed its people again. Puerto Ricans deserve answers and accountability from Luma for this latest fiasco,\" Camille Rivera, founder of La Brega Y Fuerza, a grassroots advocacy group, said in a statement. \"Luma has Puerto Rico in an energy stranglehold, and Puerto Ricans shouldn't have to put up with continued subpar service.\"",

      "In helping instigate a heated debate over H-1B visas, Elon Musk is speaking both from personal experience and as a business owner.

Musk also vowed to \"go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend.\"",

    "summary": "The Treasury Department says Chinese hackers accessed several department workstations and unclassified documents. China denies any involvement.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Chinese hackers remotely accessed several U.S. Treasury Department workstations and unclassified documents after compromising a third-party software service provider, the agency said Monday.",
      "The department didn't provide details on how many workstations had been accessed or what sort of documents the hackers may have obtained, but said in a letter to lawmakers revealing the breach that \"at this time there is no evidence indicating the threat actor has continued access to Treasury information.\" It said the hack was being investigated as a \"major cybersecurity incident.\"",
      "\"Treasury takes very seriously all threats against our systems, and the data it holds,\" a department spokesperson said in a separate statement. \"Over the last four years, Treasury has significantly bolstered its cyber defense, and we will continue to work with both private and public sector partners to protect our financial system from threat actors.\"",
      "China denied any involvement, Agency France-Presse reported, citing China's foreign ministry as saying Beijing \"has always opposed all forms of hacker attacks, and we are even more opposed to the spread of false information against China for political purposes.\"",
      "\"We have stated our position many times regarding such groundless accusations that lack evidence,\" foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.",
      "Chinese Embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu dismissed the allegations, calling them an effort to \"smear\" China's reputation.",
      "\"The U.S. needs to stop using cybersecurity to smear and slander China, and stop spreading all kinds of disinformation about the so-called Chinese hacking threats,\" he said in a statement, noting that China \"itself is a target of international cyberattacks, and consistently opposes and combats all forms of cyberattacks.\"",
      "The revelation comes as U.S. officials are continuing to grapple with the fallout from a massive Chinese cyberespionage campaign known as Salt Typhoon that gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans. A top White House official said Friday that the number of telecommunications companies confirmed to have been affected by the hack has now risen to nine.",
      "The Treasury Department said it learned of the problem on Dec. 8 when a third-party software service provider, BeyondTrust, flagged that hackers had stolen a key \"used by the vendor to secure a cloud-based service used to remotely provide technical support\" to workers. That key helped the hackers override the service's security and gain remote access to several employee workstations.",
      "The compromised service has since been taken offline, and there's no evidence that the hackers still have access to department information, Aditi Hardikar, an assistant Treasury secretary, said in the letter Monday to leaders of the Senate Banking Committee.",
      "The department said it was working with the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and that the hack had been attributed to Chinese culprits. It did not elaborate.",

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Reps. Mike Turner, Republican of Ohio, and Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Jan. 5, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to \"Face the Nation.\" As we begin the new year, the first few days of January are already proving and providing enormous challenges, both here in Washington and around the country, especially in terms of security. We begin today with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner and Ranking Member Jim Himes, who join us in a bipartisan fashion. Thank you for doing so and for joining us today.",
      "REP. MIKE TURNER: Thanks for having us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we have, Chairman, heightened security at U.S. airports, on trains, military bases. This bulletin that went out recently warning of perhaps retaliatory attacks, copycat attacks from that New Orleans car ramming incident. How should Americans understand the threat environment we're in?",
      "REP. TURNER: Right, right. Well, it's certainly very difficult, and our heart breaks as we think of what occurred just after New Year's Eve, on New Year's Day. The- what we know that the FBI director has said is that we- we are in a heightened, threatened environment. We see from, of course, what occurred in New Orleans. We have the threat of those who can be lone wolves, those individuals who might be, as the self-declared terrorist has indicated, inspired by ISIS, by terrorist threats. We also have those who- who are here, who have come across the border, that the director has said are affiliated with terrorist groups, organizations outside of the country who want to do Americans harm. Those individuals still pose a threat to Americans and to the United States. The director, the FBI, local law enforcement are continuing to work to try to find them and try to lessen the risk, but certainly at this time, as we go into the inauguration for Donald Trump, where we even have state actors like Iran who- where we have in-custody individuals who have come here with the stated purpose to- to assassinate as a part of a plot, to have been alleged to perpetrate a plot to assassinate Donald Trump. We have a number of actors that pose a risk and a threat to Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Himes, ISIS has not claimed responsibility for this New Orleans attacker. He did pledge allegiance in these social media videos, but Homeland Security, as far as we have heard from them, said there's no linkage to the US border. There is no linkage established to a foreign actor at this point. Is this just an example of someone with mental health issues choosing violence?",
      "REP. JIM HIMES: Well- and I'm glad you said that, because there was so much misinformation right out of the box, because these attacks happened at the same time. You know, there was all sorts of stuff on social media about how they were coordinated and together, and that the Las Vegas, with New Orleans, you know, the New Orleans- Jabbar, the attacker there, clearly had himself affiliated with ISIS. Now, what we need to know and what- to date, there is no evidence that this is the case, but we need to know whether that individual was deliberately tasked. Again, no evidence that he was. And of course, we constantly see these lone wolf attackers who get radicalized, maybe on social media, maybe in some other location. And- and you know, I would certainly agree with Mike's characterization of the danger out there. But just to add that, as Americans think about the people who are protecting them, and I think the chairman would agree with me on this, the people and assets that we put up against this threat are the best in the world. It is also true that lone wolf attackers, that is an individual who's not communicating with somebody abroad, who's not sending texts or sending emails, are extraordinarily difficult to detect. And you know, though our people are the best in the world, that is hard to find. And by the way, there's a role for people, you know. In New York City, if you go on the subway, it says, if you see something, say something. And so there's a role for everybody out there, you know, to help try to solve, to help try to stop these kinds of lone wolf attacks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But as one official said to me, this isn't a problem you solve with another aircraft carrier to the Middle East. Some of these things run deeper. In terms of the lone wolf element, that's the term you've used. How do you diagnose and deal with that, Chair Turner, if people are able to be radicalized online? And whether it's political violence or just another form of domestic violent extremism?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, on the issue of New Orleans, we- we don't know yet whether or not he- he will evolve as- as the actual lone wolf, where he operated completely alone. As Jim is saying, as the investigation unfolds, he himself indicated that he joined, as he claimed it, ISIS in the summer. We don't know what that involved. We don't know if it's going to turn out that he was tasked- excuse me. He- he went to New Orleans also in October. There may have been opportunities or times at which he could have been found and could have been prevented. We'll learn what those are, and ways in which he might have been- been found, and maybe we could have intervened. But those will give us greater opportunities at which we'll look to how we might be able to, in the future, find others.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Now, we've spoken to both of you on this program, in particular about the heightened threat environment many times. And back in June, when there was that arrest of those eight men from Tajikistan who were ISIS linked, we spoke in depth about that. Chair Turner, shortly after that, you said on this program, \"we have terrorists that are actively working inside the United States that are a threat to Americans.\" Do you know if there are active terror cells in the United States right now?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, I think- I think the issue of cells, and you are talking about that beginning of the show, are there individuals that are affiliated with ISIS and terrorist groups and organizations that have crossed the border, that are inside the United States? Director Wray, FBI director, has said so, we certainly have intelligence that says so, I agree with his assessment that- Jim has also seen it. He's testified before our committee publicly of that fact. Those individuals are working in conjunction with- with ISIS, with the intention of harming Americans. The director has said it directly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They are known to U.S. intelligence and law enforcement, is what you're telling me.",
      "REP. TURNER: And we are working diligently to try to take them down, to prevent them from doing so. And that's why the director is publicly saying such, and that's what the new administration is going to be handed the fact that these individuals are here, that we need to locate them, we need to remove them, we need to bring them to justice and prevent them from doing harm to Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When we have spoken about this issue in the past, you characterized particularly the rest of the eight as a success story, because there was no plot carried out. They were disrupted. Are the individuals that are of concern, do we know where they are? In terms of those eight they are, we know they were detained, and five of them were actually sent back to Tajikistan.",
      "REP. HIMES: You never know what you don't know. And so none of us, certainly in positions of responsibility, would ever say that there's not terrorists in the United States. Now, I'll say what I said before, which is that we have the very best people and the very best technology looking to root these people out and find them. But let's- if the question is, what should Americans be afraid of? What has killed Americans since 9/11? It hasn't been people sneaking across the border. And that's not to say that the border shouldn't be secure\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Right.",
      "REP. HIMES: The border must be secure. But what has been killing Americans? whether it was Fort Hood in 2009 I think whether it was the New York attacks that killed eight people in 2017 what we just sad- sadly saw in New Orleans. It's actually Americans who are in this country, actually, in a bizarre number of cases, service people. That was the Fort Hood attacks. That was what we saw in New Orleans. That was, though I don't- it doesn't seem to be shaping up as a terrorist attack, what we saw in Las Vegas. So again, that's hard, right? Why is that hard? Because if you're in this country, you have constitutional rights, meaning the FBI can't say without a warrant, I want your Facebook posts. I want your emails. That's what makes this very hard. And again, let's look at what has actually killed Americans in the 20 years, and sadly, it has been radicalized other Americans. So this gets to the question of, what are the mechanisms by which they are radicalized, and how can we as a community push back on that radicalism?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Which is why I asked you, that's a harder problem to solve for.",
      "REP. HIMES: Much harder. Because you have constitutional rights and because, you know, let me give you an example, if somebody is standing out on the street corner right now saying ISIS is the greatest thing in the world, and the President is a traitor. That people would say, boy, we should interview that person. That is constitutionally protected speech. And I wonder how some of my colleagues would respond to the idea, because this individual in New Orleans did post some Facebook posts saying, I pledge allegiance to ISIS. You know what if we had that debate? Should- should Facebook have instantly submitted that to the FBI? And if so, where's the line if I say I'm not a big fan of the next president, and I don't believe that he was, you know, whatever, should that go to the FBI? It's a tough conversation.",
      "REP. TURNER: Margaret, there's no question that- that- that is what we're seeing from New Orleans. But the answer to your question is, no, we don't know where they are. We don't know where the people are that Director Wray has indicated\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013the people who have exploited vulnerabilites at the southwest border.",
      "REP. TURNER: \u2013that has come across the border, that are terrorists affiliated with ISIS that intend to do American harm- Americans harm that are here in our country. We do not know where they are. And part of the work and part of the reason why he's raising the alarm is we need to find them to protect Americans. Now, what Jim's saying is absolutely correct, and that that obviously, is the part that also breaks our heart and makes what happened in New Orleans so hard is, is that we had an American who was killing Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. American born Army vet. I want to ask you both about China as well. In terms of traditional adversaries, they are looming large, here. We learned just in the past few days that China hacked the U.S. Treasury Department. This is on top of the major cyber espionage against nine telecom companies, against hacking of US infrastructure that incoming National Security Adviser Mike Waltz said was 'planting cyber time bombs' in U.S. infrastructure. How much of a trump card is this? I mean, can the U.S. expel China from these systems and get control?",
      "REP. HIMES: So, I mean, let's start with what we know. China has been absolutely predatory in just about every dimension. They've stolen our IP- our IP, our intellectual property. You know, they've manipulated the trading system to hollow out our industrial base, absolutely predatory. And by the way, I happen to believe, and It'll be interesting the chair, if the chairman agrees with me on this, they believe they can operate inside our networks without consequence, and that needs to change immediately. They need to understand that we're as good at this stuff as they are. And if they get into our networks and start planting beacons or start planting landmines or whatever, we're going to do the same to them, so that we establish deterrence. Now you also have to acknowledge that China does, and the U.S. do about $800 billion in trade back and forth, right? And if you snap your fingers and make that go away, you think COVID inflation was bad? Wait till you see that. By the way, they own a trillion dollars of our treasury. So the point I'm making here is that I think we need to be a lot tougher on them, on the areas in which they are predatory against us, even as we recognize that there are areas where we need to tread very carefully, including that economic interconnection.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know that we're going to have you both back to talk about exactly this problem. I'm out of time today, but thank you\u2013",
      "REP. TURNER: \u2013There have to be consequences.",
      "REP. HIMES: What he said.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will stay tuned. Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us."

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he's committed to helping Donald Trump \"achieve success\" when Trump returns to the White House, but Thune said he will convey to the president-elect \"what's realistic\" in the Senate.",
      "\"We want to get to the same destination, but I think at times, there will be differences in how we get there,\" Thune said in an interview with \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"And I think I have to spell out as clearly as I can to anybody who asks, what the challenges are in the Senate.\"",
      "Thune stressed that the Senate, with a new Republican majority, functions differently than the House, where members are faced with reelection every two years. Thune said that \"understanding the unique aspects of how the Senate operates is something that I'm going to have to be able to share and convey to the President and help him understand.\"",
      "With a Republican trifecta in Washington, GOP leaders have touted a mandate to deliver for the American people on Trump's agenda outlined on the campaign trail. Thune said he speaks with Trump \"fairly regularly,\" noting the two men have been in contact since before the election and especially now as they \"start charting the path forward\" on the Republican agenda.",
      "\"We're working closely with his team now as we start to take control of the Senate now,\" Thune said Friday as the new Congress convened. \"And hopefully in the next couple of weeks before he takes the oath of office, we'll have things set up for him, including the opportunity to confirm a lot of his nominees.\"",
      "For Thune, who took over Friday as majority leader following Sen. Mitch McConnell's decision to step down after nearly two decades at the helm, among his first priorities will be the confirmation of Trump's nominees to top administration and Cabinet positions. The Senate's confirmation process is expected to take center stage when Trump takes office later this month, as the chamber faces pressure to quickly confirm the picks \u2014 some of whom have sparked controversy even among the president-elect's party.",
      "With a 53-seat majority, Senate Republicans have a narrow margin for opposition when it comes to Trump's nominees. And with a razor-thin GOP majority in the House, both chambers have a precarious path to approving key legislative priorities more broadly \u2014 from border security to taxes \u2014 making coordination between the president and the two chambers a prime concern.",
      "Thune cited Vice President-elect JD Vance, who has represented Ohio in the Senate since 2023, as a bridge between the upper chamber and the Trump administration, calling him \"an incredibly talented person\" whom he said has been a \"quick study\" in the Senate.",
      "\"I think he will be somebody who can help the administration, as they work through these issues, figure out what's realistic, what's achievable, what we can accomplish here in the Senate, because he's been here,\" Thune said. \"He knows it's challenging in the Senate.\"",

      "The following is the full transcript of an interview with House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Jan. 5, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined by Speaker Emerita, Nancy Pelosi. It's so good to see you here in person.",
      "SPEAKER EMERITA NANCY PELOSI: My pleasure to be here. Thank you so much.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, tomorrow morning at the Capitol you and other members of Congress will be there to certify the election win in 2024 of Donald Trump. There's an unprecedented level of security, in part because of what happened four years ago with the violent attack by his supporters to change the outcome of the last election. Why do you think that so many members of the American public decided that was not disqualifying when it came to reelecting him president?",
      "SPEAKER EMERITA PELOSI: Well it- again, thank you for the opportunity to talk about this because the denial that they had about the election, which is what they were acting upon, and the denial they've had since then about what happened on Jan- January 6 is just appalling. They want to revise history. And they just- they just can't. But I'm so glad that they have increased security and I'm hoping that this will be very peaceful because- the public knows it. Now to your question, I think- it isn't, I- I wouldn't say that the American people disregarded this. They just had a different view as to what was in their interest, economically and the rest. So I don't- I don't call this a disregard of January 6. I just call it something that they saw in their interest economically.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even just last night at Mar-a-Lago, Donald Trump was screening a documentary about the 2020 election, claiming his win and trying to talk about the legal challenges he had. There seems to be a continued effort to claim that he won in 2020.",
      "SPEAKER EMERITA PELOSI: It's really sad. It really is sad. And I don't know about the film that he had and the rest, but it's- it's almost sick that he would be thinking that in 2020. He's won the election now, that will be clear- that will be clear, and tomorrow he will be clearly- we will be accepting the results of the Electoral College. So he should be triumphant about that. But to be still trying to fight a fight that he- he knows he lost is- is really sad.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, the President-elect has said that in the first nine minutes of his new term, he will pardon many of those who participated in January 6. He said he'll look at it on a case-by-case basis, but in looking back at what happened four years ago, there are recordings, there's video evidence of what happened. This is personal for you, some of these rioters in your office. chanting your name. One of them, one of the defendants: \"We were looking for Nancy to shoot her in the friggin brain, but we didn't find her.\" For you, this is personal. So when you hear about pardons, do you think the non-violent attackers deserve to be pardoned?",
      "SPEAKER EMERITA PELOSI: The non-violent- I think that's a violent attacker, with the intent\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 the violence itself.",
      "SPEAKER EMERITA PELOSI: Yeah\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013The violent language, you think.",
      "SPEAKER EMERITA PELOSI: The violent language- yes, the intention. And of course, the intention to attack the Vice President of the United States. Now it didn't end that day. As you know, he called out to these people to continue their violence, my husband being a victim of all of that, and it still- he still has injuries from that attack. So it just goes on and on. It isn't something that happens and then it's over. No, once you are attacked, you have consequences that continue. So I don't- it's really a strange person who's going to be President of the United States, who thinks that it's okay to pardon people who are engaged in an attack. But let's- you know, let's do this. Let's just say okay to the American people. This is what this is about. Do not be conned by the denial of the election of 2020 and- why would he be saying that? But he- but he is. And then on top of that, the denial of what happened on January 6.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But some of the 1600 defendants here were really only charged with trespassing. And when you look at the profiles, University of Chicago did a study, half of those who broke into the Capitol were white collar workers. They were small business owners. Didn't necessarily have a criminal record. When you look at that profile, you said intention. It- it was the intention itself, you think, that needs to be considered more so than the crime. You know that- that it casts the crime itself of trespassing in a different light for you.",
      "SPEAKER EMERITA PELOSI: Well the President said he would go on a case-by-case basis. So I assume that- that some of those people may not have engaged in the violent activities that some of the others did. Look at this beautiful Capitol, the dome built by Lincoln. Under Lincoln's leadership during the Civil War, they said, don't build the dome. It takes too much steel and person power, manpower, they said, from the war effort. And he said, no, I have to show the resilience of America. And then under that dome you saw, you saw flags, the flags that, you know, just horrible flags under the dome of Lincoln. And so it was a tragedy, and we cannot be in denial about what it was. If the President is going to go on a case by case basis, I hope he does, and then maybe\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Trespassers, you would be comfortable with pardoning?",
      "SPEAKER EMERITA PELOSI: Well, just depends on how they define what that is. But the- but I know that some of that encouragement and then the follow up that- that so many people were threatened, including me and- and to my home, looking for me and finding my husband, and as I say, who still suffers from head injuries from- on that day. So these things don't just happen and go away when you have a head injury. But anyway to- to- to see the threat to so many people in elective office, now going beyond me, but so many people in elective office, it shouldn't be a threat to your family that you have chosen to do public service.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You wrote in your book about that 2022 attack on your husband, and you said your daughter told you [if] she had known what you were signing up for, she would never have given you her blessing to run for office in the first place. Do you think that this threat of domestic violent extremism is having a chilling effect on new talent and- and anyone running for office?",
      "SPEAKER EMERITA PELOSI: Well, I certainly hope not. But over the years, when I was encouraging people to run for office, especially women, they would say, we could never take the abuse that you take, and that was really just abuse. It wasn't physical, it was criticism and the rest of that, and that we don't want our children subjected to that. And yes, I do think it will have a negative impact on people running for public office. Just- you know, in other words, if you're- if you're a mom, and they go after you as a- as a mom, and your child comes home crying from school because somebody said a negative thing, because they saw it on TV, that the other side said something bad about you, you might not run for office.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you think it will discourage particularly women\u2014",
      "NANCY PELOSI: Particularly women.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014from running?",
      "SPEAKER EMERITA PELOSI: Yeah, I do. I mean, I know that it has. But I hope that it will not, that we will have shine a bright light on this and just say, this is unacceptable. This is unacceptable. See, for women, they always- they always- women are known to be more, shall we say, ethical, than men. And so when they go after women candidates, they go after their ethics. And they'll say this, that and the other thing. And then the child comes home from school crying because somebody said a bad thing about mom on TV. And nobody- nobody wants that. So hopefully the bright light shining on that will reduce- reduce that. But I think that women have proven that they are- are more ethical, and that they- they are, well, maybe they're not more ethical, they're all ethical, but that they can- then withstand that criticism.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you- during the first Trump presidency, as speaker, you took very public stance to challenge Donald Trump when he was president. Democrats now are in the minority in this new congress. Tom Suozzi from New York recently said, it would be a mistake for Democrats to reflexively oppose Trump's ideas and brand themselves a \"national resistance movement.\" This is a Democrat who won in a Trump district, and he's warning fellow Democrats. Do you agree resistance is a bad strategy this time?",
      "SPEAKER EMERITA PELOSI: Well I- let me just say, historically, when I became speaker, it was when I ran with a Republican president, George Bush, and we opposed his policies. He wanted to privatize Social Security. And so we went against that, and we won. And then when I won again as speaker, George- Donald Trump was president, and we ran against him by saying, we're going to save the Affordable Care Act. This is- this is it. We were saving Social Security in the beginning. Now we're saving the Affordable Care Act. So we won the majority, yes, by disagreeing on certain points. That doesn't mean you disagree on every issue, no. But it does mean that you protect the values that bring you to Congress, the vision that you have about health care, the values that you have about health care, again, because health care is an issue that is so important because health care cost are so high that- that it affects whether you can have housing, whether you can have food on the table, and the rest. And so\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you would encourage Democrats to work with Donald Trump on an issue like health care?",
      "SPEAKER EMERITA PELOSI: I don't know that he wants to be on health care.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are there opportunities to work with him on anything?",
      "SPEAKER EMERITA PELOSI: No- on other issues. No. On health care, no. But no, just be- well, we both- with George Bush on many issues, and- several issues, let me say, and no, I don't- I don't say that we should work with him on health care. I'm saying we are out there to protect the Affordable Care Act. He said, Obamacare sucks. Now that's not something we want to work with, that Obamacare sucks. So we want to be out there to save the Affordable Care Act, and recognize that reducing the cost of health care can enable people to have housing, have food on the table and the rest. And that's- there are studies that show the relationship between ability to have housing and food when you have good, affordable care, health care.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Speaker Emerita, thank you for your time today.",
      "SPEAKER EMERITA PELOSI: Thank you. My pleasure to be with you. Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back with a lot more \"Face the Nation.\" Stay with us."

      "SEN. THUNE: Thanks, Margaret, right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So let's start big picture. Republicans have unified control here in Washington, but the House Republicans have a pretty fractured caucus, a pretty narrow majority. How do you see that complicating the work you're able to get done over here in the Senate?",
      "SEN. THUNE: Well, we need- obviously, as you said, to get anything done, we have to work as a team. And we have unified control. We have the majorities in the House, the Senate, the White House, but the majority in the House is incredibly narrow, which creates some unique management challenges. But they've worked around them, and we will work around them and work with the Trump administration, the President and his team, on an agenda that he campaigned on, and that many of our colleagues here in the Senate and the House campaigned on, and so we're excited about the opportunity. Yes, it's- these are unusual circumstances with respect to the margins, particularly in the house, but we expect to deliver on what the American people asked us to do.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Particularly among Republicans.",
      "SEN. THUNE: \u2014but what I- but I think when it comes to the big issues, securing the border, rebuilding the military, strengthening the economy, you know, generating energy dominance for this country, those are all things on which we agree. And so I think as we proceed forward, you know, with respect to even narrow margins, I think we're going to have a- hopefully a very unified effort when it comes to those core issues. We'll disagree on the margins and the process and all that sort of thing, but when it comes to the things we need to get done for the American people, that we think move the country in the right direction, those are all things I think we agree on.",

We've stayed in pretty good communication and contact, both in advance of the election and then subsequent to it, and especially now as we start charting the path forward with- with the agenda, obviously getting consultation from him, from his team. We're working closely with his team now as we start to take control of the Senate now, in the House today, and hopefully in the next couple of weeks before he takes the oath of office, we'll have things set up for him, including the opportunity to confirm a lot of his nominees.",

He's widely respected by his colleagues here in the Senate and in the House, I would add. And I think he will be somebody who can help the administration, as they work through these issues, figure out what's realistic, what's achievable, what we can accomplish here in the Senate, because he's been here. He knows it's challenging\u2014",
      "(CROSSTALK BEGINS)",

      "SEN. THUNE: \u2014but he's an incredibly talented person, as you know, very smart and a quick study. And I think there- if there's anybody who has been able to acclimate and understand the, sort of the unique aspects of how the Senate operates in a short amount of time, it's him. But he's the President of the Senate, and I would expect that he'll continue to be someone that acts as a, you know, sort of an intermediary with the- with the White House and the Senate and the House in trying to implement the President's agenda.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've had disagreements with Donald Trump in the past, as part of this Advise and Consent role, the role of the Senate. Will you tell him when you think he's wrong?",
      "SEN. THUNE: I will, and I think my job is to do everything I can to help him achieve success, be a successful president, which, in my view, means that we'll be a successful country. The things that he talked about on the campaign trail, the things that the American people voted for, are all things that I think this President wants to get done, we want to get done, and I say that our incentives are aligned. We have the same set of objectives. We want to get to the same destination, but I think at times, there will be differences in how we get there. And I think I have to spell out as clearly as I can to anybody who asks, what the challenges are in the Senate. The Senate is a very different institution. Clearly functions different than the House of Representatives. And understanding the unique aspects of how the Senate operates is something that I'm going to have to be able to share and convey to the President and help him understand, I think, what the- you know, what the contours are, what we can accomplish here in the Senate, and what's realistic",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have a 53 seat majority over here, which means you can only lose three votes if Democrats remain unified in their opposition to some of Mr. Trump's picks for his cabinet. Do you expect them all to make it through? And if so, how quickly?",
      "SEN. THUNE: I think, what I've promised is a fair process for all of them, and we'll ensure that they get a confirmation hearing, an opportunity to make their case, answer the hard questions that inevitably are going to come, and perform the role that the Senate has in terms of advice and consent. But I also believe that the President deserves- I defer to the President. I'm very- when it comes to his picks, and I would say this of any president, they deserve a lot of latitude. And I think that, you know, his picks are going to come through a process where, if they get reported out of the committee, come across the floor of the Senate, we'll make sure that they get the- the vote. And I think that- I suspect a lot of them will get through. And- and we'll see about all of them. Remains to be seen, but I think that's why we have the process, and we will adhere to that process and give all of these nominees an opportunity to make their case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've said you have to see if Democrats play ball or not, but you don't need Democrats to get these through. So does that mean you already know some of your Republican senators won't vote to confirm Kash Patel at the FBI or Pete Hegseth at the Pentagon?",
      "SEN. THUNE: We don't have, at this point, I don't think, clarity on that. I think these are nominees who are new enough, they've been going around and conducting their meetings, which I think, frankly, have gone very well, but they still have to make their case in front of the committee. And, you know, we don't know all the information about some of these nominees. I think we know a lot about them, but they deserve a fair process, and that's what we've committed to and promised and- and I expect to deliver on. And ultimately, whether or not they get through that process is- is going to be up to each individual senator and how they decide to vote. We have a three vote margin in the Senate, as you point out. But I do think that in most cases, at least, most of our Republican senators are inclined to give the President the people that he wants in these positions, given, you know, the process that they go through and whether or not they can manage the committee process and ensure that they get to the floor for vote.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does that include FBI background checks? I know often the ranking members get them on armed services, for example, but some of your colleagues, they want to see Pete Hegseth's FBI background check before they vote.",
      "SEN. THUNE: Right, and I think that's going to be determined largely by the committee chairs. I think there will be an interest, obviously\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013would you encourage them?",
      "SEN. THUNE: Well, sure. I mean, I think that you want to have as much background as possible that is available to the committees as they make their decisions. But I have a lot of confidence in our committee chairs. One of the things that I've made a focus of, at least my leadership here, is to get the committees functioning again, in a way, ensuring that the committee chairs and individual members of the committee have an opportunity to make sure their voices are heard in the process and that we take advantage of the talent that we have on those individual committees. So I have a high level of confidence in our chairs that they will ensure that as members of the committee, and of the full Senate, have an opportunity to consider these nominees that they've got all of the information available to them that they should have.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: One of your colleagues told me you are a \"count the votes guy.\" You're not a \"twist the arm guy.\" Do you think that's fair?",
      "SEN. THUNE: Well, I think that, you know, sometimes it depends a little bit on what your role is. The job that I have held now for the last six years, the whip job, differs if you're in the minority or in the majority. If you're in the majority, you need to get the votes. You're in the minority, you want to know where your vote count is, and you're playing defense as opposed to playing offense. They're very different roles. But I know, I believe how to- I understand my members have worked with them all for a really long time, and I think whether it's actually counting, and I think we're very accurate when it comes to counting. I take great pride in that, and the team- the work the team has done the last six years. But also it's important to get the votes, and I believe when necessary, we know how to do that, and I've had to do that in the role that I have now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Joe Manchin, a now former senator, told us recently on \"Face the Nation\", that if you- his dad told him, \"if you can say no with a tear in your eye, you're all good.\" Do you agree with him on that?",
      "SEN. THUNE: Well, I think that, you know I- what I've always said is, and as a whip, every member's vote is their vote. You in the end can't force somebody to vote, you know, how they- against what their- their wishes are, what their constituents want them to do. So their vote is their vote. What I've always asked is that they not surprise us, and that if they give you- tell you something, that that's that that's their word and and you expect them to adhere to that. And that's kind of always the way that I proceeded. And I think there are times in which individual senators, for state reasons, and the constituents that they represent may come to a different conclusion, and that's their right. That's their prerogative. And that's why my style, as I described, is obviously, it's persuasion. It's trying to get them to a place where, if possible, they can support the team. But I understand there are circumstances in which they're going to have to reflect the views the people that elected them, and that's- that's what this job ultimately, is about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Recess appointments. Bypassing the Senate entirely. Would you ask Mr. Trump not to do that?",
      "SEN. THUNE: Well, here's the thing, and you asked earlier about cooperation from the Democrats. I don't think the Democrats are going to give us any votes. I mean, I hope they do. And I think they will on some- some nominees. I mean, I've got enough feedback, readouts, I think, from some of these meetings, and I think that the some of our the President's nominees, will win Democrat votes, but by and large, their leadership\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Senator Rubio, for example\u2013",
      "SEN. THUNE: \u2013Sure, yeah. I mean\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013But Tulsi Gabbard?",
      "SEN. THUNE: Well, but I mean\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Pete Hegseth, Kash Patel.",
      "SEN. THUNE:\u00a0 We'll see there's a whole bunch of- of nominees, some of whom will have more Democrat support than others. But I think in the end, the Democrat leadership, in most cases, is probably not going to be largely supportive of some of the President's picks, with maybe a few exceptions. But what's more important to me is not how they ultimately vote. You're right. You pointed this out. We have a majority. If we get 51 votes, Republican votes, we can win most of these nominees, but it's how much they drag that process out. And I pointed out to people that if you go back to President Obama, he had his first 12 Cabinet nominees in 15 days. It took President Trump 42 days and President Biden 50 days. So we're moving in the wrong direction when it comes to giving a President the opportunity to get their people in place as quickly as possible. And so what I've said is we're going to keep, you know, the options at our disposal to make sure that we are moving in a way consistent with the way the Senate functions and works that gets these folks an opportunity to be voted on in the Senate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about what you need to get done policy wise as well, in terms of providing the president the funding to execute on some of his big goals.",
      "SEN. THUNE: Right",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said you're going to go out of the gate with a generation- \"a generational investment in border security and immigration enforcement.\" You're going to pass it on 51 party line votes. If you want to govern through regular order, why go through this in a party line direction?",
      "SEN. THUNE:\u00a0 Well, it's one of those issues that has become incredibly divisive for the country, and there aren't very many people left in the middle. Reconciliation enables us. It doesn't come along very often where you have unified control of the government. In a lot of cases, it doesn't last very long. It's a couple of years. The Democrats provided a template in the last couple of years for how to expand the scope of what's available to get done through the reconciliation process. It's the only process in the Senate that enables you to enact legislation with a 51 vote threshold, as opposed to 60.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SEN. THUNE: And so immigration, the border\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, it's out of the gate saying, we're not going to work with Democrats.",
      "SEN. THUNE: Well, I'm not saying what- they came out of the gate. They had their first reconciliation bill done in four weeks coming on it when they got the majority.",

      "SEN. THUNE: 11:01:11\u00a0 \u2013 and another- another trillion with the IRA.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly.",
      "SEN. THUNE: It would be ideal if we could figure out a way to do things at the 60 vote threshold and there are a number of things we will. I mean, there are a number of issues where we're going to have to get 60 votes. We have to get 60 votes on appropriation bills. We have to get 60 votes on 60 votes on a farm bill, which is expired. Those are going to be bipartisan initiatives, but there are some things that you can do. And the Democrats, again, created the template for doing this with how they did the IRA and the American Rescue Plan for doing some things at 51 and we think that a generational investment in the border is necessary, given where we are after the last four years of a what I think is a very failed Biden Harris border policy. And I think there isn't anybody who objectively wouldn't agree with that. 10 and a half million people coming across the border illegally, including a lot of very unsavory folks, members of terrorist organizations and criminal elements and cartels, etc.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Do you know they're members of terrorist organizations? Here on U.S. soil?",
      "SEN. THUNE: Sure. Yeah. Well, I'm saying they've been apprehended there. We know that there are almost 300 that have been apprehended that are on the terrorist watch list.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SEN. THUNE: And I think if they've apprehended that many, I suspect a lot of them have gotten through.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are 1.4 million people here with deportation orders, orders of removal against them. I've seen numbers that put the cost of expelling them at between $80 to $100 billion annually. Can you get that kind of money in the first 100 days?",
      "SEN. THUNE: Well, I think that what we're trying to do is get an assessment from the people who are going to be in place. They're going to be implementing a lot of the President's policies when it comes to the border determine what that- that resource allocation is going to need.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They don't know yet.",
      "SEN. THUNE: Well, I think that what we do know is we need physical barriers. We need technological barriers. We need more ICE agents. We need more Border Patrol agents. And yes, we're going to need ways of deporting people that are on that- on that list that you mentioned. And so it's going to take some resources to do that, which is why I would argue that when the President takes office and he's going to do a lot of things on the border by executive order, by executive action, that we're going to need to be able to provide the resources in order for him to do that. And that's why I've suggested that we take that border issue on right away and enable him to do the things that- that he needs to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it true you're going to put some defense spending in that as well?",
      "SEN. THUNE: Well, I think one of the things that we always argue about around here is the amount of money that we need to spend on defense. And clearly that is an issue where if you look at every Biden administration budget, there wasn't a single one of them when it came to military spending that came up- kept up even with inflation. So we have a military readiness in this country. You know, we have the defense strategy or commission, defense commission strategy group that comes out with report all the time and tells us we are dramatically underfunded relative to countries like China\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Those should be bipartisan issues, right?",
      "SEN. THUNE: And that we don't have the capacity well, and we don't have the capacity and the capability to do what needs to be done to protect the country. So, I- my argument would be, and yes, those should be bipartisan, but there- it is very difficult, in my experience around here, there's a big difference in Delta, in the two parties and how they approach the issue of defense and, you know, and military readiness. And I think we are dramatically underfunding our military today. I think the President believes that, President Trump, and I think a lot of our Republican colleagues in the House, the Senate, share that view. So can we do this through reconciliation? We're obviously looking at our options.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to make sure I ask you about the other big promise you made in terms of delivering on tax reform and reconciliation. The estimates are it could add $4 trillion over the next decade. Is that really something you think is going to pass on a party line vote and without any revenue or spending cuts? You can't be comfortable.",
      "SEN. THIUNE:",
      "Well- there- there are- its current policy. So it's- it is these are- these are tax laws that will expire at the end of this year if Congress doesn't take action to extend them, and it would represent a $4 trillion tax increase on the American people if we don't extend that policy. We're going to have a very robust conversation about tax reform. I was a big part of it back in 2017 when we did the initial Trump tax cuts. And this time around, there's a lot riding on it. There's a lot riding on it economically. I think regulatory policy, tax policy, energy policy, are going to be really essential to the strength of the- our economy, how fast we can grow and expand and create better paying jobs in this country. So I'm a big believer in pro-growth tax policy. I believe you get a lot of that back through growth and additional revenue every 1 percent\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Not tariffs as Mr. Trump has promised?",
      "SEN. THUNE: Well, that's- that's a different subject, but I would say every 1 percent increase in GDP and economic growth, we're told, generates about $3 trillion in additional tax revenue. So you're going to get some back in terms of a growth dividend, and there will be spending cuts. There's no question about it. Our members in both the House and the Senate want to ensure that when we do tax reform through reconciliation, that it also includes significant reductions in spending, particularly in certain areas. And I think that's something that as we work through this, we'll figure out a way to do this in a way that hopefully inspires 51 votes in the Senate and 218 in the House to get this across the finish line.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But going out of the gate with two big issues on party line votes \u2013 aren't you concerned that will blow up your chances at working with Democrats on some of those bigger immigration issues or bigger policies?",
      "SEN. JOHN THUNE: Well, I think we- we need to continue to work on those big policy issues, but I also think we have some immediate concerns - matters that need to be addressed - one of which is national security, given the increasingly dangerous world in which we live. And of course, I would argue that starts with the border. So border, national security. I think energy policy, energy dominance is a huge objective and goal, and I would hope that a reconciliation bill could also address that issue. If we do something on taxes, that traditionally has been- in the past, the Democrats did it twice while they had the majority in the last session of the Congress, they did two big reconciliation bills, both of which did a lot of tax policy, spending policy, etc.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Trump did that in 2017 too, with taxes.",
      "SEN JOHN THUNE: And that's - and both sides have done it. And that's- that's the unique aspect of having unified control of the government. You can do things in the Senate at 51 votes. But I think those are all important, and they are things that, as a country, if we don't get right, I fear what the results and the outcome will be. You can't have a $4 trillion increase in taxes on the American people at the end of this year if Congress doesn't act. I think that is a very compelling, you know, powerful incentive for members of Congress to come together and work constructively in a unified way as a team to get some of these things done. And yes, it'd be ideal if you could do it bipartisan. I hope that there are some Democrats who would vote for some of the tax policies that we have, but I'm not- I'm not expecting that at the moment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Leader, it is wonderful to be here with you and to have the time, and I hope we can have more conversations in the future.",
      "SEN. JOHN THUNE: Sounds good. Thanks Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's a lot more to cover.",

      "Here's what to expect this time.",
      "How does Congress count the presidential election results?",
      "Senators and members of the House will meet in a joint session, with Vice President Kamala Harris presiding, to tally the electoral votes from the 50 states and the District of Columbia.",
      "The vice president will read aloud the electoral votes, and then Congress counts each state's results to affirm Trump's victory.",
      "The process is typically a ceremonial step before a president is inaugurated on Jan. 20.",
      "Does Congress always count results on Jan. 6 following presidential elections?",
      "Congress is required by law to count the electoral votes on Jan. 6 after each presidential election. However, the date has been temporarily changed by law\u00a0when Jan. 6 fell on a weekend. In 2013, Congress affirmed that President Barack Obama won the election on Jan. 4, rather than on Jan. 6, which was a Sunday.",
      "What is the Electoral Count Reform Act, and what's different about Jan. 6 this time?",
      "After the Capitol riot in 2021, Congress moved to reform the Electoral Count Act \u2014 a 1887 law that governed the counting of electoral votes \u2014 to prevent another effort to overturn the results of a presidential election.",
      "Congress passed the Electoral Count Reform Act in 2022, which clarified that the vice president's role in presiding over the joint session of Congress is ceremonial. It also made it more difficult for members of Congress to challenge a state's electors by raising the threshold to 20% of members of each chamber. Previously, just one member of the House and one senator were needed to raise an objection.",
      "Following Trump's defeat in the 2020 election, he and his allies fueled unfounded allegations of fraud and argued that Vice President Mike Pence had the authority to accept or reject electoral votes. Pence denied he had such authority.",
      "As Congress was tallying the votes in 2021, Rep. Paul Gosar, an Arizona Republican, joined Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, to object to Mr. Biden's votes from Arizona.",
      "The joint session was then suspended and the House and Senate separately debated the objection. The process was abruptly interrupted as a violent mob of protesters made their way into the building after Trump urged them to march to the Capitol.",
      "Hours later, after rioters were cleared from the building, both chambers voted to reject the objection that would have thrown out Arizona's electoral votes for Mr. Biden. The House and Senate then reconvened in a joint session to continue the count. They later were forced to split and debate another objection to Pennsylvania's results, which was brought by Republican Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri. Both chambers also rejected the attempt to throw out the state's votes for Mr. Biden.",
      "What happens if a member of Congress objects to the electoral votes?",
      "This time, it will be nothing more than a complaint. In the last presidential election, a member from each chamber needed to object to the count to force lawmakers to debate and vote on whether to accept or reject a state's results. The Electoral Reform Act, passed by Congress in 2022, raised the threshold to one-fifth of members in each chamber.",

She now serves as director of the Carter Presidential Library and Museum in Atlanta, Georgia, where\u00a0a memorial service was held\u00a0for the late president Saturday as part of his six-day state funeral following his death last weekend at the age of 100.",
      "\"When I met President Carter for the first time, I told him about the letter, we both laughed about it,\" Evans told CBS News.",

Evans said Carter overcame the lack of name recognition to win the presidency.\"Nobody had any idea,\" Evans said of Carter in the early portion of both races. \"And some of the campaign videos talk about Carter who? Who's that? And then there's this conversation about who he is and what he stands for.\" \u00a0 Carter defeated President Gerald Ford in 1976, putting his own stamp on the inauguration when he became the first president to get out of the limo and walk at his Inaugural Parade.",
      "\"He was the first to get out of the car,\" Evans said. \"And I thought, look at this \u2014 he's a trailblazer and didn't even realize he was a trailblazer.\" \u00a0 The museum highlights the Camp David Accords in which Carter negotiated a peace agreement between the leaders of Israel and Egypt in 1978.",
      "\"I would argue, it is probably one of the greatest things he ever did,\" Evans said. \"He brought two arch enemies together and had a treaty signed. Not many presidents can say they did that.\"",
      "But Carter's presidency was mired with controversies, from record inflation to the Iran hostage crisis, ultimately sealing his defeat against President Ronald Reagan. The 39th president went on to establish the Carter Center, focusing on humanitarian work, which earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.",
      "According to Evans, Carter received the Nobel with \"joy and humility.\"",

      "\"It seems proper at this juncture to make known the court's inclination to not impose any sentence of incarceration, a sentence authorized by the conviction but one the (prosecutors) concede they no longer view as a practicable recommendation,\" Merchan wrote.",
      "Trump's lawyers claimed the constitutional demands on a president-elect \"superseded\" the jury's decision and ongoing proceedings in the case.",
      "Bragg's office argued that the judge had a range of options, including \"novel\" ones to balance the interests of justice with the unprecedented circumstance of a convicted defendant being elected to the presidency before sentencing. Their suggestions included postponing proceedings until after Trump's term in office, and even terminating the case and its proceedings with a note that the verdict had not been set aside.",
      "Merchan said Trump's own motion to dismiss acknowledged that a president-elect is not entitled to immunity from criminal proceedings.",
      "\"Undoubtedly, the transition period between election and the taking of the presidential oath is one filled with enormous responsibility,\" Merchan wrote. \"Yet, even (the) defendant in his motion refers to presidential immunity as one relating specifically to a sitting president no fewer than 33 times.\"",
      "Trump's conviction carried with it the potential for up to four years in jail, but also a wide range of alternatives to incarceration, including probation and fines.",
      "Merchan said in his ruling that after Trump's victory, his attorneys' rhetoric changed from \"spirited\" to \"dangerously close to crossing the line.\"",
      "\"Counsel has resorted to language, indeed rhetoric, that has no place in legal pleadings. For example, countless times in their motion to dismiss, counsel accuses the prosecution and this court of engaging in 'unlawful' and 'unconstitutional' conduct,\" Merchan wrote.",
      "Merchan cited a recent report by the Supreme Court's chief justice that warned about elected leaders undermining the judiciary",
      "\"Viewed in full context and mindful of the parties to this action, such arguments, in the broader picture, have the potential to create a chilling effect on the third branch of government,\" Merchan wrote.",
      "Despite Merchan's excoriation, Trump communications director Steven Cheung did not hold back in a statement on the ruling. He called the case a \"witch hunt\" and Merchan \"deeply conflicted.\"",
      "\"This lawless case should have never been brought and the Constitution demands that it be immediately dismissed,\" Cheung said.",
      "Merchan's decision is the latest in a string of historical firsts set by the case. Trump's indictment in March 2023 made him the first former president in U.S. history to be criminally charged. He was subject to a seven-week trial this spring, which took place during the Republican presidential primaries.",
      "Inside the courtroom, Trump grumbled quietly, but often leaned back in his chair with his eyes closed as prosecutors and lawyers questioned more than 20 witnesses. At times his head drooped down, as he apparently dozed off. In the hallway just outside the courtroom \u2014 surrounded by a rotating posse of Republican allies, lawyers and Secret Service agents \u2014 Trump seethed about the case while campaigning to a gaggle of press cameras.",
      "At times, his dual commitments to the court and the cameras caused trouble. Merchan held Trump in contempt 10 times for violating a gag order prohibiting public statements about potential jurors, witnesses and others.",
      "Witnesses, beginning with former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker, described two schemes at the core of the case. The first was a plan hatched by Trump, Pecker and former attorney Michael Cohen to \"catch\" stories or allegations that might hurt Trump's 2016 presidential candidacy and \"kill\" them by paying people in exchange for nondisclosure agreements. Pecker and others described three such arrangements, known as \"hush money\" payments.",
      "Days before the election, Cohen paid $130,000 to adult film star Stormy Daniels \u2014 also a witness in the trial \u2014 in exchange for her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump in 2006. He and another witness described Trump's relief that voters didn't learn of the story before the election.",
      "Cohen also described an arrangement in which he was covertly reimbursed for the payment to Daniels. The jury concluded Trump, while president in 2017, authorized a scheme to falsify business records in order to conceal Cohen's repayment. That scheme ultimately included 34 falsified records connected to monthly installments portrayed as payments for ongoing legal services, when they were in fact Cohen's reimbursements for the Daniels payoff.",
      "The jury took less than two days to reach its verdict. Trump, who had frequently stared at the jury of his peers during the trial, would not make eye contact with them as his sentence was pronounced.",
      "He looked straight ahead as the jury's foreperson pronounced Trump guilty 34 times, and as Merchan thanked the jury for their service before allowing them to file out of the room.",
      "After Merchan himself stepped out, Trump rose, frowning deeply, and briefly grasped his son Eric's hand.",
      "Trump led his entourage out of the courtroom, huddled for a moment with his lawyers, and then turned to address the cameras awaiting his reaction.",
      "He proclaimed his innocence, raged against the case and returned to his campaign for president.",

    "story": [
      "Richard Cavazos' name is already recognized across the U.S. Army. He forged a path through service in Korea and Vietnam to become the first Hispanic four-star general, leading to a legacy that included the renaming of Texas' Fort Hood for him. It's now Fort Cavazos.",
      "But on Friday, he finally received the nation's highest military award, the Medal of Honor.",
      "Cavazos, who died in 2017, earned the award for actions during the Korean War in 1953, when the young first lieutenant led his company through multiple rounds of assaults to destroy an enemy outpost \u2014 all while facing heavy fire. After his company was ordered to pull back, Cavazos returned alone several times to rescue missing soldiers, even though he had also been wounded.",
      "Cavazos, along with six other veterans, received the Medal of Honor for their actions in Korea or in Vietnam.",
      "President Biden awarded the seven medals during a ceremony at the White House Friday, noting, \"These are my final days as commander-in-chief.\"",
      "\"It's been the greatest honor of my life to be entrusted with the greatest fighting force in the history of the world, the finest military in the history of the world,\" Mr. Biden said, as he expressed gratitude for the veterans' \"integrity, their patriotism and their courage.\"",
      "\"They \"not only fought for our nation, but ... embody the very best our nation has to offer,\" the president added.",
      "One of the recipients, Kenneth W. David, who earned the honor for heroism in Vietnam, received the award in person, while the families of the other deceased recipients accepted the award in their honor.",
      "Some of the families worked for decades for the recognition. Cpl. Fred B. McGee's daughter, Victoria Secrest, had advocated for him to receive the award since the early 1990s.",
      "\"The odds are against you, and I started to look like the crazy lady with the clipboard everywhere I went. And then with the computer, the laptop everywhere I went. And then with the iPad everywhere I went. And here we are in 2024, about to step into 2025, and we've made it.\" Secrest told reporters at a media roundtable late last month.",
      "McGee received the award posthumously for commanding his squad unit in Korea after its leader and several others were wounded during an assault on an enemy post. He eventually had to order his unit to withdraw, but he voluntarily stayed behind to evacuate the wounded and dead, despite facial wounds he sustained.",
      "In the 1950s, McGee received an unusual form of recognition for his heroism. He was honored in a comic book, but there was an error.\u00a0 \"They forgot his melanin,\" Secrest said. The comic portrayed McGee as White, even though he was Black.",
      "Others have been honored in their home communities. A statue of PFC Charles Johnson at the high school he attended in Arlington County in New York depicts him saving Donald Dingee, a fellow Arlington High School classmate. Johnson was killed in action in Korea while saving the lives of as many as 10 wounded soldiers, including Dingee.",
      "Johnson posthumously received the Medal of Honor for the actions he took in June 1953.",
      "Although the honors are about 70 years in the making, it's clear these veterans had an immediate impact on their communities.",
      "Charles Allen, the nephew of Medal of Honor recipient Pvt. Bruno R. Orig, during the media roundtable told Richard E. Cavazos' son Tommy that his father \"is indeed a hero.\"",
      "\"I did get a chance to meet your father.\" Allen told Cavazos. \"He was already a retired four-star (general). He was a mentor, senior mentor, 'Gray Beard,' as we affectionately called him\u2026 And when he spoke, everyone listened, everyone listened, and he impressed me then.\"",
      "Allen's uncle received the award for actions he took near Chipyong-ni, Korea on Feb. 15, 1951, to administer first aid while under attack and firing at the enemy while Orig's platoon safely withdrew.",
      "Capt. Hugh R. Nelson Jr., who served in the Vietnam War, was the commander of a Huey helicopter conducting a search-and-destroy reconnaissance mission in June 1966 when it was struck by a large volume of enemy fire. Nelson and the pilot were able to crash land the helicopter and then Nelson helped evacuate the other wounded members of the crew from the helicopter. He used his body as a shield to cover one of his crew members from intense enemy fire, sacrificing his own life to save them.",
      "And finally, PFC Wataru Nakamura received the Medal of Honor for actions he took near P'ungch'on-ni, Korea on May 18, 1951, when he alone rushed enemy forces with a fixed bayonet and drove the enemy from several bunkers they had captured. He withdrew to restock on ammunition then continued to charge at the enemy, killing four in two bunkers. He was killed by an enemy grenade.",
      "Nakamura's nephew, Gary Takashima thinks that his uncle, if he were alive, would react to receiving the award with humility. Takashima told reporters his uncle \"would have been greatly honored to receive the Medal of Honor but would have felt all of this was too much for doing what he was supposed to do.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 16:52:00 -0500",
    "summary": "A government panel failed to reach consensus on national security risks of a proposal for Nippon Steel to purchase U.S. Steel, leaving the decision to the president.",
    "story": [
      "President Biden announced Friday that he is blocking the $15 billion proposal by Japan's Nippon Steel to buy U.S. Steel after a government panel recently failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of the deal.",
      "Mr. Biden said his decision is aimed at protecting the nation's security and infrastructure, as well as supply chain resiliency. The U.S., he said, needs domestic companies that represent the majority of the nation's steelmaking capacity to \"keep leading the fight on behalf of America's national interests.\"",
      "Mr. Biden\u00a0long opposed the deal\u00a0and was waiting for a report on the merger to be issued by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, to announce his final decision. The interagency committee, chaired by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, reviews such deals with an eye toward potential national security risks, and can block sales or force changes in the terms to protect national security. CFIUS said on Dec. 23 that it was unable to reach a consensus on the deal, leaving it to Mr. Biden.",
      "\"It is my solemn responsibility as president to ensure that, now and long into the future, America has a strong domestically owned and operated steel industry that can continue to power our national sources of strength at home and abroad; and it is a fulfillment of that responsibility to block foreign ownership of this vital American company,\" the president said in a statement Friday announcing his decision to block the deal. \"U.S. Steel will remain a proud American company \u2014 one that's American-owned, American-operated, by American union steelworkers \u2014 the best in the world.\"",
      "An accompanying order prohibiting the proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel signed by Mr. Biden said there is \"credible evidence\" that Nippon Steel \"might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.\"",
      "\"This action reflects my unflinching commitment to utilize all authorities available to me as president to defend U.S. national security, including by ensuring that American companies continue to play a central role in sectors that are critical for our national security,\" the president's statement said.",
      "Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel condemned the decision and said in a joint statement they would take \"all appropriate action\" to protect their legal rights. The companies called Mr. Biden's move \"unlawful.\"",
      "\"We are dismayed by President Biden's decision to block Nippon Steel's acquisition of U. S. Steel, which reflects a clear violation of due process and the law governing CFIUS,\" the companies said. \"Instead of abiding by the law, the process was manipulated to advance President Biden's political agenda. The president's statement and Order do not present any credible evidence of a national security issue, making clear that this was a political decision.\"",
      "They argued the record before CIFIUS shows the acquisition would strengthen national security and claimed the committee's process was infected by politics.",
      "\"It is shocking \u2014 and deeply troubling \u2014 that the U.S. government would reject a procompetitive transaction that advances U.S. interests and treat an ally like Japan in this way,\" the two companies said. \"Unfortunately, it sends a chilling message to any company based in a U.S. allied country contemplating significant investment in the United States.\"",
      "In a separate statement provided to CBS News, U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt called Mr. Biden's decision \"shameful and corrupt.\"",
      "\"He gave a political payback to a union boss out of touch with his members while harming our company's future, our workers, and our national security,\" Burritt said. \"He insulted Japan, a vital economic and national security ally, and put American competitiveness at risk.\"",
      "Mr. Biden, backed by the United Steelworkers, said earlier this year that it was \"vital for (U.S. Steel) to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.\"",
      "But a U.S. official familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the private report, said some federal agencies represented on the panel were skeptical that allowing a Japanese company to buy an American-owned steelmaker would create national security risks.",
      "Before Mr. Biden announced his decision,\u00a0U.S. Steel\u00a0had indicated it was likely to file lawsuits, including against the Biden administration, if the president blocked the acquisition, sources familiar with the process said. Cleveland-Cliffs, which lost its bid for U.S. Steel, could also be named, as well as its president Lourenco Goncalves and U.S. Steelworkers president Dave McCall.",
      "On Tuesday, Nippon Steel, which is headquartered in Japan, proposed giving the U.S. government direct veto authority over any changes to U.S. Steel's production capacity. The proposal represented a minor change to a recommendation from CFIUS that was intended to allay concerns that Nippon Steel's proposed purchase of U.S. Steel could lead to a decline in domestic steel output and a reduction in its U.S. workforce.",
      "Both Mr. Biden and President-elect Donald Trump courted unionized workers at U.S. Steel during the presidential campaign and vowed to block the acquisition amid concerns about foreign ownership of a flagship American company. However, the appeal of Nippon Steel's acquisition was that it has the financial resources to invest in the mills and upgrade them, possibly helping to preserve steel production within the U.S.",
      "Trump also opposed the acquisition and vowed in a Truth Social post earlier this month to \"block this deal from happening.\" Trump proposed to revive U.S. Steel's flagging fortunes \"through a series of Tax Incentives and Tariffs.\"",
      "The steelworkers union said it doubted Nippon Steel would keep jobs at unionized plants, make good on collectively bargained benefits or protect American steel production from cheap foreign imports.",
      "In the face of political opposition, Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel waged a public relations campaign to win over skeptics. U.S. Steel said in a statement Monday, Dec. 23, that the deal was \"the best way, by far, to ensure that U.S. Steel, including its employees, communities, and customers, will thrive well into the future.\"",
      "A growing number of conservatives had publicly backed the deal, as Nippon Steel began to win over some steelworkers union members and local officials around its blast furnaces in Pennsylvania and Indiana. Many backers said Nippon Steel has a stronger financial balance sheet than rival Cleveland-Cliffs to invest the necessary cash to upgrade aging U.S. Steel blast furnaces.",
      "Nippon Steel has manufacturing operations in the U.S., Mexico, China and Southeast Asia. It supplies the world's top automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp., and makes steel for railways, pipes, appliances and skyscrapers.",
      "In September, Mr. Biden issued an executive order expanding the factors that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States should consider when reviewing deals, such as how the deal impacts the U.S. supply chain or whether it would put Americans' sensitive personal data at risk.",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 14:59:33 -0500",
    "summary": "One of the first priorities for Senate Majority Leader John Thune is the confirmation of President-elect Donald Trump's expected nominees.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Friday that he doesn't believe there is \"clarity\" yet on whether all 53 Republican senators will support President-elect Donald Trump's picks for his second administration.",
      "In an interview with \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" Thune, who took charge of the Senate on Friday with the start of the 119th Congress, was asked whether he knows some of his GOP colleagues will vote against confirming Pete Hegseth for defense secretary or Kash Patel for director of the FBI.",
      "\"We don't have, at this point I don't think, clarity on that,\" Thune said. \"I think these are nominees who are new enough, they've been going around and conducting their meetings, which I think, frankly, have gone very well, but they still have to make their case in front of the committee. And, you know, we don't know all the information about some of these nominees. I think we know a lot about them, but they deserve a fair process, and that's what we've committed to and promised and and I expect to deliver on.\"",
      "Thune noted that Republicans have a three-vote margin in the Senate and said each individual senator will decide how to vote on Trump's picks.",
      "\"I do think that in most cases, at least most of our Republican senators are inclined to give the president the people that he wants in these positions, given, you know, the process that they go through and whether or not they can manage the committee process and ensure that they get to the floor for a vote,\" he said.",
      "Still, Thune predicted that \"a lot of them will get through, and we'll see about all of them.\"",
      "\"I think that's why we have the process, and we will adhere to that process and give all of these nominees an opportunity to make their case,\" he said.",
      "Thune is taking over as the Senate majority leader and head of the chamber's Republican conference, a position he secured in November following the general election. The South Dakota senator succeeds Sen. Mitch McConnell, the longest-serving party leader in Senate history, at the helm of the GOP.",
      "With the 119th Congress officially underway, one of Thune's first tasks as majority leader will be overseeing the confirmation process for Trump's expected nominees to key government positions. Some of the president-elect's picks, such as Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of state and Rep. Elise Stefanik as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, are expected to easily win Senate approval.",
      "But others, like Hegseth and Patel, face a less clear path. Former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who served as a Democrat in the House, is also expected to come under close scrutiny by senators as they consider whether to confirm her for director of national intelligence, as is Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who is Trump's pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "Hegseth was on Capitol Hill last month working to shore up support from Republican senators following accusations of sexual misconduct, financial mismanagement of veterans' charities and excessive drinking. Hegseth, a former Fox New host and Army veteran, has denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Patel, meanwhile, is a Trump ally whose selection to lead the FBI has raised concerns that he would weaponize the agency to target the president-elect's opponents. Gabbard does not have experience in the field of intelligence and has faced criticism for her positions on Russia's war with Ukraine and U.S. involvement in Syria's civil war.",
      "Kennedy is likely to face questions about his past claims about vaccines and statements about their proven benefits and safety.",
      "Patel, Gabbard and Kennedy were also on Capitol Hill meeting privately with senators before the holidays.",
      "Most of the Senate committees that will conduct confirmation hearings for Trump's expected nominees have not yet set dates for the proceedings. Hegseth is set to appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee for his confirmation hearing Jan. 14, chairman Roger Wicker announced last month. FBI background checks could also slow down the process.",
      "Background checks are typically only shared with committee leaders and not the full panel, but some Republicans and Democrats have been pushing for access for the FBI's report on Hegseth, according to Politico.",
      "Asked whether he would encourage access to those background checks for senators, Thune said \"sure,\" adding, \"I think that you want to have as much background as possible that is available to the committees as they make their decisions.\"",
      "But the president-elect has urged the GOP-led chamber to move swiftly, especially following the New Year's Day terrorist attack in New Orleans that left at least 14 people dead.",
      "Thune, too, said earlier this week that the rampage on Bourbon Street underscores the need for the Senate to act quickly to confirm Trump's nominees.",
      "\"The threat posed by ISIS will outlast this administration, and this is a clear example of why the Senate must get President Trump's national security team in place as quickly as possible,\" he wrote on X.",

Jabbar was a 42-year-old U.S. citizen from Texas and had served in the U.S. Army, an Army spokesperson confirmed.",
      "The FBI said Thursday that the attacker posted videos declaring support for ISIS before the massacre, and investigators do not believe Jabbar had accomplices.",
      "Christopher Raia, deputy assistant director of the FBI's counterintelligence division, said that Jabbar rented a Ford electric pickup truck through a peer-to-peer rental app called Turo and picked the vehicle up in Houston on Dec. 30. He drove to New Orleans the following day and during the drive, posted five videos to his Facebook account, Raia said.",
      "In the videos, the attacker proclaimed support for ISIS and said he had joined the terror group over the summer, according to the FBI. While the investigation into Jabbar's motive is ongoing, Raia said the driver was \"100% inspired by ISIS.\"",
      "FBI bomb technicians also recovered two improvised explosive devices in coolers, Raia said.

    "summary": "With newfound control of both chambers of Congress, Republican leaders are touting a list of priorities that they aim to quickly address, like immigration and taxes.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A new Congress is kicking off on Friday as Republicans take control of the House and Senate ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's return to the White House later this month. And with their newfound control of both chambers, Republican leaders are touting a list of priorities that they aim to quickly address, notably immigration and taxes.",
      "How exactly Republicans will proceed remains to be seen. Earlier this week, House Speaker Mike Johnson outlined plans to move the GOP agenda through the budget reconciliation process, which allows them to fast-track certain types of legislation and avoid the 60-vote threshold typically required in the Senate. But reconciliation is a complicated maneuver that comes with its own limitations on what can be included.",
      "Johnson, who faces his own dicey speaker's election on Friday, said a reconciliation package will be \"the key of the first 100 days,\" but he noted that it will require \"a lot of coordination, planning and executing those plans with precision.\"",
      "\"We are going to fix the border,\" Johnson said on Fox News on Monday. \"We are going to get the economy humming again. We are going to restore our stature on the world stage, get our energy policy fixed, make sure that we don't have the largest tax cut in U.S. history imposed upon the American people at the end of next year when the tax cuts from the Trump era expire.\"",
      "The first days of the new Congress will be marked by the speaker's election, which is required before the House moves on to other business, and the counting of the Electoral College votes on Monday, Jan. 6.",
      "Congressional Republicans have touted their alignment on the issues, saying that they have a mandate from the American people to deliver on Trump's \"America First\" agenda. Still, a unified vision of how to move forward with the priorities has appeared cloudy as the new Congress begins. And whether Republicans ultimately pursue one or two reconciliation bills remains a point of contention.",
      "\"We have a lot on our plate,\" Johnson said. \"But I'm confident we're going to be able to get it done.\"",
      "Here's where Republicans plan to start:",
      "Immigration",
      "Republicans have for months touted a plan, following Trump's lead, to pursue a radical shift on immigration policy. The pledge became a key part of the president-elect's campaign as he promised to target both unauthorized and legal immigrants with unprecedented measures, including mass deportations.",
      "Many of the immigration proposals are expected to be implemented through executive orders. But Republican leaders in Congress have outlined plans to pursue parallel legislation that would surge resources to the southern border and continue construction of Trump's border wall, while working to bolster Border Patrol and technology at the border.",
      "On the timing of the legislation, Sen. John Thune, the incoming Senate majority leader, outlined that it \"makes sense for us to move quickly\" on immigration in an initial reconciliation package, paired with defense and energy provisions. This plan would leave economic measures such as addressing Trump's expiring 2017 tax cuts for a later date.",
      "\"I think we can do both,\" Thune said last month. \"We've got an opportunity to have a couple of different chances at a reconciliation package that would achieve all of those objectives.\"",
      "In order to approve legislation using the reconciliation maneuver, lawmakers must first approve a budget resolution and direct committees to craft bills reconciling spending with the new budget goals. The final product can only include provisions dealing with taxes, spending or the debt limit, and any new spending must be paid for. The Senate parliamentarian must also sign off on the package, confirming that the provisions have direct budgetary consequences, if an item is challenged.",
      "Stephen Miller, the incoming White House deputy chief of staff, said on Fox News in December that the plan is to put both a border security and tax package on a \"fast track,\" with a border package expected to reach Trump's desk by January or early February. Miller said it would mark the \"largest investment in immigration and border security\" in history.",
      "The leaders of the House Freedom Caucus have also weighed in, pushing in December for a standalone border package. The group of House conservatives argued in a letter to Johnson that it's \"imperative that we first send \u2014 in January \u2014 a focused and quick border reconciliation package that is fully offset.\"",
      "\"President Trump's agenda will be enacted, and border security must move first,\" the group wrote, adding that a larger reconciliation package focused on \"taxes, spending, energy, bureaucracy and more\" should come second.",
      "Taxes",
      "By year's end, key portions of Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are set to expire. Republicans want to extend them, or even make them permanent.",
      "Republicans are also aiming to build upon the tax cuts by strengthening existing provisions, including research and development costs that companies spend on innovation, and others that encourage domestic ownership of intellectual property. They may also pursue a child tax credit with work requirements, while addressing disagreements on state and local tax deductions.",
      "Johnson acknowledged last month that the tax piece \"can be very complicated,\" prompting discussion about where it fits into the timeline.",
      "The plan will rely on whether leadership can keep the House and Senate Republican conferences together. With 53 seats in the Senate, Republicans have room for just two defections under the budget reconciliation process. And in the House, with a likely 219-215 party breakdown, Republicans will also have little room for error \u2014 especially during the beginning of Trump's term, when three seats will be vacated by lawmakers leaving to serve in the executive branch.",
      "Meanwhile, House Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith has advocated for one reconciliation package, arguing that pairing the tax provisions with the other policies would help it maneuver through the narrow House majority. Under either scenario, whether the party can stay together to pass the tax cut extensions, along with other key priorities, remains to be seen.",
      "Despite possessing a GOP trifecta when Trump entered office in 2017, Republicans fell short of a number of goals in the early days of the administration due to infighting and disorganization. And a more recent fight over the government funding process in December suggests the party may still struggle to remain unified going forward.",
      "Marc Short, a former legislative director under Trump, said on CNBC in December that the disagreement over government funding \"foreshadows how difficult it's going to be to pass any sort of extension of tax relief.\" And he argued that Trump made an unforced error when he brought the debt ceiling into the conversation \u2014 an issue that will be in play in the new Congress.",
      "Debt ceiling and government funding",
      "Trump called for House Republicans to increase the debt ceiling, which limits how much the government can borrow to pay its bills, during the government funding fight in December. And although lawmakers approved a stopgap measure to keep the government funded into the spring, they couldn't agree on the last-minute request to address the debt ceiling. Democratic leaders called the fight premature, and fiscal conservatives opposed raising the debt ceiling without spending reforms.",
      "Though the debt ceiling isn't among Republicans' legislative priorities, it has major implications for the GOP's ability to advance its agenda.",
      "Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a letter to congressional leaders that the government will reach its borrowing limit sometime between Jan. 14 and 23. Once the limit is reached, the Treasury Department will implement so-called \"extraordinary measures\" to stave off a default on the government's debt. The department will then estimate an \"X date,\" the point at which the government will be unable to pay its obligations.",
      "In recent years, the debt limit has been used as a negotiating point in broader spending talks, dancing with a default that would have catastrophic implications for the global economy. Trump wanted the issue addressed before he takes office, imploring Republican lawmakers to suspend the debt ceiling or eliminate it entirely to deprive Democrats of leverage in upcoming spending fights under his watch.",
      "Johnson told reporters as the spending fight came to a close last month that he planned to address the debt ceiling in January, when congressional Republicans look to clear the way for their legislative priorities.",
      "Energy",
      "Republicans are also aiming to address energy policy in their budget reconciliation plans, pledging to \"unleash\" domestic energy production by mandating lease sales, opening federal lands for drilling, easing energy permitting regulations and rolling back energy provisions of President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act. Whether lawmakers pursue other energy priorities, like clean energy tax credits, remains to be seen.",
      "The plan, billed as a way to increase the nation's energy independence, comes amid a broader campaign pitch from Republicans to cut costs, while clawing back Democrats' climate-centered policies.",
      "Approving Cabinet nominees and other top administration roles",
      "Trump has announced picks for dozens of Cabinet and top administration officials, many of whom will require Senate confirmation. While confirmation hearings can begin before Trump's inauguration, the formal voting process can't begin until Jan. 20, when the picks will become official nominations. The picks are then expected to monopolize the Senate's schedule.",
      "Thune has repeatedly pledged that Senate Republicans will work to swiftly approve Trump's nominees after he takes office. Trump has threatened to make unilateral appointments where he can if the process stalls.",
      "Still, a couple of Trump's picks, like his selection for defense secretary in Pete Hegseth, have been controversial even among some Republicans, posing questions about their speedy confirmation.",

      "Richard Butler, a paleobiologist from the University of Birmingham, said some chance weather may be the reason the tracks had been so well preserved.",
      "\"We don't know exactly... but it might be that there was a storm event that came in, deposited a load of sediments on top of the footprints, and meant that they were preserved rather than just being washed away,\" he said.",
      "Quarry worker Gary Johnson, whose watchfulness triggered the excavation, said the experience had been spellbinding.",

    "story": [
      "December is coming to an end with a \"black moon\" on Monday night, Dec. 30, but those hoping to see the phenomenon will be out of luck.",
      "That's because a black moon is the term for the second new moon to fall in a single calendar month, and new moons appear invisible to the naked eye from Earth. While new moons happen throughout the year, two new moons only fall in a single calendar month about once every 29 months, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac.",
      "The moon will gradually become more visible in the coming days, reaching its first-quarter stage by Jan. 6 and becoming a full moon by Jan. 13, according to NASA.",
      "Those hoping to catch another black moon won't have to wait too long, as there are actually several types of black moons, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. Some people use the term to refer to the third new moon in a season that has four new moons. This type of black moon is rarer than the more common definition, occurring once every 33 months. The next black moon under this definition will be on Aug. 23.",
      "The term black moon can also be used when there are no new moons in a month, which can only happen in February because of its short length. This only happens every 19 years or so, with the next one in 2033, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac.",
      "Some even use the term black moon to refer to every new moon, since at that phase, the illuminated face of the moon can't be seen from Earth.",
      "Most months have one full moon and one new moon because the lunar calendar largely lines up with a calendar year. But just as it's possible for there to be two new moons in a single month, there can also be two full moons, with the second full moon in a single month considered a blue moon. Similar to how black moon can have more than one meaning, blue moon also refers to the third full moon in a season with four full moons.",
      "There are no monthly or seasonal blue moons in 2025, according to TimeAndDate.com. The next monthly blue moon is on May 31, 2026 and the next seasonal blue moon will fall on May 20, 2027, with dates varying depending on time zone.",

    "summary": "Hundreds of new species across the globe were identified by scientists in 2024.",
    "story": [
      "A vampire hedgehog, a pygmy pipehorse and a \"blob-headed\" fish were among the hundreds of new species identified in 2024.",
      "The variety of species identified was quite eclectic and names for the new species crossed a broad spectrum of locations and formations \u2014 some even inspired by politicians or celebrities.",
      "A new plant bug species was named after Vice President Kamala Harris (P. kamalaharrisae) and another after Harrison Ford (P. harrisonfordi) for their commitments to climate and conservation science, said California Academy of Sciences researcher Brad Balukjian, who introduced 17 new species in the Pseudoloxops family from French Polynesia.",
      "Actor and environmentalist Leonardo DiCaprio had a new species of snake named after him. Researchers discovered the small copper-colored snake in the Himalayas and named the species Anguiculus dicaprioi.",
      "Locations where scientists discovered these species included Peru, the Ecuadorian Amazon and the Greater Mekong region in South Asia. The California Academy of Sciences said their scientists made findings across six continents and three oceans, which led to describing 138 new animal, plant and fungi species.",
      "\"Finding and describing new species is vital for understanding the biodiversity of our planet and protecting it from further loss,\" said virologist Shannon Bennett, chief of science for the California Academy of Sciences.",
      "The number of new species identified in 2024 cannot be tallied or determined by one list. Researchers present their findings in various papers, conferences and among the scientific community. Inclusion is made tricker because discoveries can be made by anyone, anywhere, but describing and identifying a new species requires a scientific process.",
      "That process involves study and analysis of the new specimen and similar organisms, and then assigning the species a new name. A species can be discovered, but may not necessarily be described until years later.",
      "Bennett told CBS News that when scientists describe a new species, they liken it to \"a coming out ball.\" For the first time, Bennett said, the species is correctly identified and finally has its place in the world.",
      "Regardless, Bennett said \"scientists estimate that we've identified only one-tenth of all species on Earth.\"",
      "Here are some of the 2024 highlights.",
      "Vampire hedgehog, a soft-furred hedgehog with \"fang-like teeth\"",
      "According to\u00a0a report from WWF, 234 species were identified this year in the Greater Mekong region, which includes Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam.",
      "Among them was Hylomys macarong, a vampire hedgehog. The soft-furred hedgehog with fang-like teeth inspired its scientific name. The word Ma c\u00e0 r\u1ed3ng is Vietnamese for \"vampire.\"",
      "First photographed in 2009 in the wild in Vietnam by a team from the Russian Vietnamese Research Centre, the vampire hedgehog was identified as a new species as part of an international effort to revise the taxonomy of lesser gymnures, the WWF said.",
      "Specimens that helped lead to the description of the vampire hedgehog were housed in the Smithsonian, researcher Arlo Hinckley told WWF. He stressed the importance of maintaining collected specimens from \"poorly sampled regions\" in order for \"the next generation\" of researchers to make new discoveries that may have been overlooked.",
      "Pygmy pipehorse, found off the coast of South Africa",
      "Researchers at the California Academy of Scientists knew they might discover something new after local divers in South Africa's Sodwana Bay told them about an unfamiliar species. But scientists were worried they would not be able to spot the tiny pygmy pipehorse \u2014 about the size of a golf tee.",
      "\"South African reefs present notoriously difficult diving conditions with rough weather and intense, choppy waves \u2014 we knew we only had one dive to find it,\" said scientist and study co-author Richard Smith in a news release earlier this month.",
      "But Smith and Graham Short \u2014 the scientist who originally described the pygmy pipehorse genus Cylix in 2021 \u2014 were undeterred, according to the academy. Originally the pygmy pipehorse was found in the cool temperate waters surrounding the North Island of New Zealand. Discovering a new species in subtropical waters expanded the range of the group.",
      "\"Luckily we spotted a female camouflaged against some sponges about a mile offshore on the sandy ocean floor,\" Smith said in the news release.",
      "They named the new pygmy pipehorse species C. nkosi, after the local Zulu word for \"chief,\" the academy said.",
      "\"Blob-headed\" fish baffles researchers",
      "Among eight new species of fish identified in Peru's Alto Mayor region this year, the most shocking was the \"blob-headed fish,\" according to a report published this month by the nonprofit group Conservation International.",
      "In the summer of 2022, researchers with the group's Rapid Assessment Program conducted a biological survey across a largely unstudied area in Alto May's central region and found what was later determined to be at least 27 species new to science and 49 species that are threatened with extinction, per the IUCN Red List.",
      "Among those that were new was a \"blob-headed fish\" in the Chaetostoma\u00a0genus, which includes bristlemouth armored catfish. The team's fish scientists had never seen a fish with an enlarged blob-like head, Conservation International said.",
      "\"The function of this unusual structure remains a mystery,\" researchers said in a statement.",

The update showed that Parker had executed pre-programmed commands and that its science instruments were operational during the record-breaking approach.",
      "\"While Parker Solar Probe was closer to the Sun than any other human-made object in history, it operated just as it was designed to do, and made observations that no one has been able to make before,\" Parker Solar Probe Project Manager Helene Winters said in a statement. \"From the heat shield to the solar array cooling system, there was so much enabling technology required to fly this mission, and to gather data scientists have awaited for decades. Parker Solar Probe's ability to thrive in the hostile environment around the Sun is a tribute to the team that designed and built this remarkable spacecraft.\"",
      "Parker, which launched in 2018, has flown through the sun's crownlike outer atmosphere, or corona, and the spacecraft is expected to circle the sun through at least September. The probe's next two close flybys of the sun will occur March 22 and June 19, NASA said Thursday.",
      "Parker is the fastest spacecraft built by humans, and reached a top speed of 430,000 mph at closest approach, according to the Associated Press. The probe is outfitted with a heat shield that can withstand temperatures up to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit, the AP reported.",

      "The Quadrantids have the potential of 200 meteors an hour under perfect conditions, but most astronomy fans can catch 20-30 meteors an hour under clear, dark skies during the peak, according to NASA. The moon will be a \"mere crescent\" and set early in the night, which should make for good meteor viewing conditions, according to the space agency.",
      "When and where you can see the Quadrantids",
      "The meteor shower will peak in the early morning hours on Friday, according to NASA. While meteor showers last for days, the per hour rate of meteors will be best during the peak and the highest as dawn approaches.",
      "The Quadrantids will be active until Jan. 16, according to the American Meteor Society.",
      "NASA advises viewing meteor showers in areas well away from city and street lights. The Quadrantids are best seen from the Northern Hemisphere, and observers in the Northwest and Pacific region will likely have the best viewing opportunities this year.",
      "Those heading outside to catch the celestial show should lie flat on their backs with their feet facing northeast and look up. Be prepared to wait about 30 minutes for your eyes to adjust to the dark. Viewers should also bring along a blanket or sleeping bag to help with the chilly January weather.",
      "What is a meteor shower?",
      "Meteors are space rocks that enter Earth's atmosphere. They streak through the sky every night, and when Earth encounters many meteors at once, it's called a meteor shower. The meteors heat up as they pass through the atmosphere, making them look like shooting stars.",
      "While most meteor showers originate from comets, the Quadrantids come from asteroid 2003 EH1 \u2014 a small asteroid that was discovered on March 6, 2003.",

      "Next year's first astral spectacle comes early, on Jan. 3, when the Quadrantid meteor shower peaks. Considered one of the most impressive annual meteor showers to witness, the event can produce between 60 and 200 visible meteors under perfect weather conditions, according to NASA.",

People across the United States should be able to see the moon covering Mars before the red planet eventually shows itself again.",
      "March 14: Total lunar eclipse and Blood Moon",
      "A total lunar eclipse will occur March 14, the first of two in 2025 but the only one that will be visible in North America. During a total lunar eclipse, Earth passes between the moon and the sun, and for a time all three are perfectly aligned. The planet casts a shadow onto the moon and prevents most sunlight from reaching it.",
      "This eclipse coincides with the Blood Moon, where the moon bears a reddish hue. The phenomenon happens because some sunlight does filter through Earth's atmosphere and reach the moon during a total lunar eclipse, but in the case of a Blood Moon, only colors with longer wavelengths, like red and orange, actually make it there.",

During a total solar eclipse, like the one seen across the U.S. and Mexico last April, the moon completely blocks the sun's rays. A partial eclipse does not have the same effect, but people in some areas will be able to see the moon positioned in front of a portion of the sun.",
      "April 21: Lyrid meteor shower",

      "Unfortunately, the American Meteorological Society notes the Perseids may not be as striking in 2025 because the shower is due to happen at the same time as a waning gibbous moon, and strong moonlight could hide as much as 75% of the meteors.",
      "Aug. 12: Venus-Jupiter conjunction",
      "The conjunction of Venus and Jupiter will fall into place around the time of the Perseids peak, Space.com reports. This alignment of two of the brightest planets in the solar system will bring Venus and Jupiter much closer to each other in the sky than they usually appear.",
      "Sept. 7: Total lunar eclipse",
      "The second total lunar eclipse of 2025 will fall on Sept. 7, according to NASA. People will be able to see it in parts of Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia.",
      "Sept. 21: Partial solar eclipse",

      "Oct. 7, Nov. 5 and Dec. 4: Supermoons",
      "There will be three supermoons next fall, on Oct. 8, Nov. 5 and Dec. 4. A supermoon happens when the full moon phase of the lunar cycle occurs while the moon is located at one of the closest points to Earth in its orbit. Because of the full moon's proximity to the planet, skywatchers tend to see a brighter and larger moon than they normally do. In 2025, the supermoon on Nov. 5 will appear particularly bright, since the moon will be nearest Earth at that time.",

    "summary": "Apple will pay $95 million to settle allegations that its Siri virtual assistant violated people's privacy by eavesdropping on mobile device users.",
    "story": [
      "Apple has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit that accused the company of turning its virtual assistant Siri into a snoop that eavesdropped on the users of iPhones and other trendy devices in a betrayal to its long-standing commitment to personal privacy.",
      "The proposed settlement filed in federal court earlier this week still needs to be approved by a judge, but here are a few things to know about the case and the privacy issues that it raised.",
      "What was the lawsuit about?",
      "The Wood Law Firm, which specializes in class-action lawsuits, filed the complaint against Apple in August 2019, shortly after The Guardian newspaper published an article alleging that Siri's microphone had been surreptitiously turned on to record conversations occurring without the users' knowledge.",
      "Apple issued a September 2014 software update that was supposed to activate the virtual assistant only with the triggering words \"Hey, Siri,\" but The Guardian story alleged Siri was listening and recording conversations at other times to help improve the company's technology.",
      "The story led to the lawsuit, which later raised allegations that Apple shared some of the conversations that Siri secretly recorded with advertisers looking to connect with consumers who were more likely to buy their products and services.",
      "How many people are covered by the settlement",
      "Tens of millions of U.S consumers who owned or purchased iPhones and other devices equipped with Siri from September 17, 2014, through the end of last year will be eligible to file claims.",
      "How much money will eligible consumers get?",
      "It's far too early to tell for certain, but the settlement currently envisions paying out up to $20 per Siri-enabled device, with each consumer limited to a maximum. The final amount could be affected by two factors \u2014 the number of claims and how much of the settlement fund is reduced to cover legal fees and costs.",
      "A claims administrator estimates only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers will file claims. The lawyers in the case currently are seeking nearly $30 million in fees and expenses, but that figure could still be lowered by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White, who is overseeing the case in Oakland, California.

      "Lawyers representing the consumers asserted that Apple's misbehavior was so egregious that the company could have been liable for $1.5 billion in damages if it lost the case.",
      "Although Apple hasn't explained the reasons for making the settlement, major companies often decide it makes more sense to resolve class-action cases rather than to continue to run up legal costs and risk the chance of potentially bad publicity. The lawsuit also targeted one of Apple's core values framing privacy as a \"fundamental human right.\"",
      "Although $95 million sounds like a lot of money, it's a pittance for Apple. Since September 2014, the company's total profits have exceeded $700 billion \u2014 a streak of prosperity that has helped propel the company's market value to about $3.7 trillion.",
      "Should I be worried about microphones on other devices being used to spy on me?",
      "Perhaps. A case similar to the one filed against Siri is still active in a San Jose, California, federal court against Google and the virtual assistant in its Android software, which has been widely used in smartphones for years.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Chinese hackers remotely accessed several U.S. Treasury Department workstations and unclassified documents after compromising a third-party software service provider, the agency said Monday.",
      "The department didn't provide details on how many workstations had been accessed or what sort of documents the hackers may have obtained, but said in a letter to lawmakers revealing the breach that \"at this time there is no evidence indicating the threat actor has continued access to Treasury information.\" It said the hack was being investigated as a \"major cybersecurity incident.\"",
      "\"Treasury takes very seriously all threats against our systems, and the data it holds,\" a department spokesperson said in a separate statement. \"Over the last four years, Treasury has significantly bolstered its cyber defense, and we will continue to work with both private and public sector partners to protect our financial system from threat actors.\"",
      "China denied any involvement, Agency France-Presse reported, citing China's foreign ministry as saying Beijing \"has always opposed all forms of hacker attacks, and we are even more opposed to the spread of false information against China for political purposes.\"",
      "\"We have stated our position many times regarding such groundless accusations that lack evidence,\" foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.",

      "\"The U.S. needs to stop using cybersecurity to smear and slander China, and stop spreading all kinds of disinformation about the so-called Chinese hacking threats,\" he said in a statement, noting that China \"itself is a target of international cyberattacks, and consistently opposes and combats all forms of cyberattacks.\"",
      "The revelation comes as U.S. officials are continuing to grapple with the fallout from a massive Chinese cyberespionage campaign known as Salt Typhoon that gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans. A top White House official said Friday that the number of telecommunications companies confirmed to have been affected by the hack has now risen to nine.",
      "The Treasury Department said it learned of the problem on Dec. 8 when a third-party software service provider, BeyondTrust, flagged that hackers had stolen a key \"used by the vendor to secure a cloud-based service used to remotely provide technical support\" to workers. That key helped the hackers override the service's security and gain remote access to several employee workstations.",
      "The compromised service has since been taken offline, and there's no evidence that the hackers still have access to department information, Aditi Hardikar, an assistant Treasury secretary, said in the letter Monday to leaders of the Senate Banking Committee.",
      "The department said it was working with the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and that the hack had been attributed to Chinese culprits. It did not elaborate.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he's committed to helping Donald Trump \"achieve success\" when Trump returns to the White House, but Thune said he will convey to the president-elect \"what's realistic\" in the Senate.",
      "\"We want to get to the same destination, but I think at times, there will be differences in how we get there,\" Thune said in an interview with \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"And I think I have to spell out as clearly as I can to anybody who asks, what the challenges are in the Senate.\"",
      "Thune stressed that the Senate, with a new Republican majority, functions differently than the House, where members are faced with reelection every two years. Thune said that \"understanding the unique aspects of how the Senate operates is something that I'm going to have to be able to share and convey to the President and help him understand.\"",
      "With a Republican trifecta in Washington, GOP leaders have touted a mandate to deliver for the American people on Trump's agenda outlined on the campaign trail. Thune said he speaks with Trump \"fairly regularly,\" noting the two men have been in contact since before the election and especially now as they \"start charting the path forward\" on the Republican agenda.",
      "\"We're working closely with his team now as we start to take control of the Senate now,\" Thune said Friday as the new Congress convened. \"And hopefully in the next couple of weeks before he takes the oath of office, we'll have things set up for him, including the opportunity to confirm a lot of his nominees.\"",
      "For Thune, who took over Friday as majority leader following Sen. Mitch McConnell's decision to step down after nearly two decades at the helm, among his first priorities will be the confirmation of Trump's nominees to top administration and Cabinet positions. The Senate's confirmation process is expected to take center stage when Trump takes office later this month, as the chamber faces pressure to quickly confirm the picks \u2014 some of whom have sparked controversy even among the president-elect's party.",
      "With a 53-seat majority, Senate Republicans have a narrow margin for opposition when it comes to Trump's nominees. And with a razor-thin GOP majority in the House, both chambers have a precarious path to approving key legislative priorities more broadly \u2014 from border security to taxes \u2014 making coordination between the president and the two chambers a prime concern.",
      "Thune cited Vice President-elect JD Vance, who has represented Ohio in the Senate since 2023, as a bridge between the upper chamber and the Trump administration, calling him \"an incredibly talented person\" whom he said has been a \"quick study\" in the Senate.",
      "\"I think he will be somebody who can help the administration, as they work through these issues, figure out what's realistic, what's achievable, what we can accomplish here in the Senate, because he's been here,\" Thune said. \"He knows it's challenging in the Senate.\"",

    "story": [
      "In his announcement speech for his presidential run, in 1974, Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter said there were things he would not do to become President: \"I would  not tell a lie. I would not mislead the American people ... and I would not betray your trust.\"",
      "If anything defined President Carter, it was his basic decency and morality. Elected in 1976 in the aftermath of Watergate and Gerald Ford's controversial pardon of Richard Nixon, Carter believed he had a responsibility to restore Americans' faith in the integrity of their government.",
      "\"We want to be proud again,\" he told the crowd at the Democratic National Convention. \"We just want the truth again.\"",
      "It was a stunning rise to power for a little-known Georgia governor. \"Jimmy who?\" was the question a lot of Americans asked when Carter first announced that he was going to run for the White House.",
      "Stuart Eizenstat, who started working with Carter when he ran for governor in 1970, and ultimately became his White House Chief of Domestic Policy, said the reason Carter thought he could win was that \"he had a great sense of his own capabilities.\"",
      "Though the son of a successful peanut farmer, Carter grew up without electricity or running water just outside Plains, Georgia. He won admission to the Naval Academy, and while at Annapolis, Carter started dating Rosalynn Smith. They married in 1946 and she would become his most trusted advisor. Eizenstat said, \"They were not only married for over 70 years; they had a love affair.\"",
      "Carter had to abandon his Naval career to take over the family peanut business when his father died.\u00a0 The Carters moved back to Plains and started raising three sons and a daughter.",
      "Chip Carter, the second-born son, recalled that, against all odds, his father captured the Democratic nomination and, with Minnesota Senator Walter Mondale as his running mate, won the election.",
      "Chip said he helped arrange one of the most famous images of the Carter inaugural: \"I went to dad's Secret Service agents and said, 'We might want to do this walk.'\"",
      "That walk down Pennsylvania Avenue seemed to symbolize the open and energetic approach Carter would bring to the White House.",
      "But it was to be a tumultuous presidency, in part because of Carter's complex personality. Journalist and author Jonathan Alter said, \"He was humble, affable, open, and then also he could be difficult, prickly, stubborn.\"",
      "Alter, who spent many hours with Carter for a biography, noted, \"There was much more accomplishment in the Carter presidency than I had thought.\"",
      "Famous for wearing sweaters to dramatize how he'd turned down the White House thermostats, Carter pushed through comprehensive energy legislation. He created the Department of\u00a0 Education; deregulated airlines; doubled the amount of land in our national parks; and in one of his most important and controversial\u00a0 initiatives, Carter negotiated the return of the Panama Canal Zone to the Panamanians. \"This opens a new chapter in our relations with all nations of this hemisphere,\" he said.",
      "But perhaps his crowning foreign policy accomplishment was pushing through the Camp David Accords, the historic 1978 agreement between Israel and Egypt. Alter called it \"the most successful peace treaty since World War II.\"",
      "But in 1979, other Middle East issues would lead to gasoline shortages that created high prices and long waits at gas stations. Carter's popularity plummeted. And in July he decided to give a speech to the nation warning of a crisis in confidence: \"Too many of us now tend to worship self-indulgence and consumption,\" he said.",
      "Much to the surprise of many politicos and pundits, the speech was immediately popular. According to Eizenstat, \"The speech hit a raw nerve, contrary to my own belief. And then, he stepped on his own headlines. He asked for the resignation of his entire cabinet. It looked like the whole government was in chaos.\"",
      "And then, in November of 1979, 52 Americans were taken hostage at the U.S. Embassy in Iran, followed by a failed attempt to get them out \u2013 all in the lead-up to the 1980 presidential election.",

      "Indecipherable homework assignments that would mystify mere mortals are, well, child's play to Suborno, something his parents marveled at early on. \"He fell in love with math,\" said his father, Rashidul Bari, also a mathematician. He said that by the age of four, his son was stumping him with math problems. \"He read all the books that I had,\" he said. \"And he was challenging me from the book, that I wasn't able to give him a satisfactory answer.\"",
      "So, it's no surprise today to find Suborno delivering university lectures in India, something he started doing at age seven. That's right: seven!",
      "Since then, Suborno has skipped multiple grades, scored a 1500 on his SAT, and at the ripe old age of 12, started college this past September at New York University. \"It feels like just the next natural step,\" he said. \"Most kids go to college after high school, so I said, 'Why not me?'\"",
      "Despite his progression, Suborno seems to have a pretty balanced point of view. \"I know it sounds strange, because it sounds like you're talking to some business CEO on '60 Minutes,' that's, like, 35 years old,\" he laughed. \"But instead I'm only 12. It feels like the voice isn't matching up with the person right in front of you.\"",
      "I asked, \"Do you sometimes wonder at the fact that you're only 12?\"",
      "\"Not really,\" Suborno replied. \"I've seen my birth certificate.\"",
      "Psychologist Ellen Winner, a professor emerita at Boston College, and a leading authority on child prodigies, said Suborno demonstrates the hallmarks of a child prodigy. She says virtually all exhibit something she calls a \"rage to master.\"",
      "\"This is all the child wants to do all the time,\" Winner said. \"Not even wanting to go out and play. The kid wants to stay inside and work on whatever it is that that child is gifted in. These are kids that really live in their own minds.\"",
      "\"Is this fairly obvious when you talk to these kids?\"",
      "\"Yes, it is very, very clear, especially in certain domains \u2013 in music performance, in mathematics, in drawing realistically,\" Winner said.",
      "But there is one area where she thinks prodigies are overlooked, because they excel at something a lot murkier: Abstract art. \"It's much harder to detect, because the work doesn't look totally different from typical kids,\" Winner said. \"But it doesn't look totally the same, either. It's more complex, it's more structured.\"",
      "So, while we've all marveled at the obvious skills of math prodigies like Suborno Bari, music prodigies, or chess prodigies, what about young artists who seem to be following in the footsteps of, say, Jackson Pollock?",
      "Meet four-year-old August Gardener, Professor Winner's grandson, who has been obsessed with abstract art for most of his young life. He's done hundreds of paintings, drawings, sculptures, and mixed media artworks.",
      "Asked how what he's doing compares to the scribbling of the average four-year-old, August's father, Andrew Gardener, a former schoolteacher, replied, \"It's the drive. It's the desire to continue doing it, and keep working, and the top-of-mindness of it.\"",
      "August's mother, Vanessa Gardener, said, \"He's often incredibly deliberate for a four-year-old boy who, like, when he's not doing that, you know, he runs around like a maniac, like a lot of four-year-old boys. But when he's working on his art, everything is very thought out and, you know, particular.\"",
      "That deliberate process is the hallmark of an abstract art prodigy, says Jen Drake, a psychology professor at Brooklyn College of the City University of New York.\u00a0 Drake (who's worked with Winner in the past) is now conducting a major study of art prodigies, and August is part of it.",
      "Speaking of August, Drake said, \"I'm really struck by his focus. That one drawing he spent several days working on, that is definitely a 'rage to master,' [demonstrating] their willingness to go back to the drawing to add something to it.\"",
      "But what of the end result? Is that art? \"That's a really good question,\" said Drake. \"And I think because his work is abstract, it may be difficult to assess the skill in there. But there is a use of color and line and form that's not found in typical preschoolers.\"",
      "And no matter what you think of August's art, Drake says his focus in making it is what really sets him apart.",
      "\"Are we talking prodigy?\" I asked.",
      "\"I would say yes. Definitely,\" Drake replied.",
      "And August is in good company: Pablo Picasso was a child prodigy. In fact, from Mozart to Einstein to Stevie Wonder, the list of brilliant people who started young is long. But being a prodigy doesn't guarantee future greatness. According to Ellen Winner, \"Most prodigies do not go on to be major adult creators in their area of giftedness. The reason is that being a child prodigy means you are mastering something that's already been invented. And to be a major adult creator, you have to go beyond what's already been done, and develop something really new.\"",
      "So, how often do we get a Picasso or a Mozart? \"Very, very rare,\" Winner said.",
      "But don't tell that to August just yet \u2026 and certainly not to math whiz Suborno Bari. He's got his eye on a Ph.D. by 16. And then what? \"I mean, I don't want to just be, like, a superstar for five years and then completely vanish and have videos made on me 10 years later saying, 'What happened to Suborno Bari?' I want to actually leave a mark that people will remember me for.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 05 Jan 2025 06:00:05 -0500",
    "summary": "Several changes to the electoral vote count have been enacted since a violent mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House and Senate will convene Monday to certify President-elect Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 election.",
      "It comes four years after a violent mob of Trump supporters attacked the Capitol to prevent Congress from affirming President Biden's win. There appear to be no plans by Democrats to stand in the way of certifying Trump's win.",
      "Here's what to expect this time.",
      "How does Congress count the presidential election results?",
      "Senators and members of the House will meet in a joint session, with Vice President Kamala Harris presiding, to tally the electoral votes from the 50 states and the District of Columbia.",
      "The vice president will read aloud the electoral votes, and then Congress counts each state's results to affirm Trump's victory.",
      "The process is typically a ceremonial step before a president is inaugurated on Jan. 20.",
      "Does Congress always count results on Jan. 6 following presidential elections?",
      "Congress is required by law to count the electoral votes on Jan. 6 after each presidential election. However, the date has been temporarily changed by law\u00a0when Jan. 6 fell on a weekend. In 2013, Congress affirmed that President Barack Obama won the election on Jan. 4, rather than on Jan. 6, which was a Sunday.",
      "What is the Electoral Count Reform Act, and what's different about Jan. 6 this time?",
      "After the Capitol riot in 2021, Congress moved to reform the Electoral Count Act \u2014 a 1887 law that governed the counting of electoral votes \u2014 to prevent another effort to overturn the results of a presidential election.",
      "Congress passed the Electoral Count Reform Act in 2022, which clarified that the vice president's role in presiding over the joint session of Congress is ceremonial. It also made it more difficult for members of Congress to challenge a state's electors by raising the threshold to 20% of members of each chamber. Previously, just one member of the House and one senator were needed to raise an objection.",
      "Following Trump's defeat in the 2020 election, he and his allies fueled unfounded allegations of fraud and argued that Vice President Mike Pence had the authority to accept or reject electoral votes. Pence denied he had such authority.",
      "As Congress was tallying the votes in 2021, Rep. Paul Gosar, an Arizona Republican, joined Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, to object to Mr. Biden's votes from Arizona.",
      "The joint session was then suspended and the House and Senate separately debated the objection. The process was abruptly interrupted as a violent mob of protesters made their way into the building after Trump urged them to march to the Capitol.",
      "Hours later, after rioters were cleared from the building, both chambers voted to reject the objection that would have thrown out Arizona's electoral votes for Mr. Biden. The House and Senate then reconvened in a joint session to continue the count. They later were forced to split and debate another objection to Pennsylvania's results, which was brought by Republican Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri. Both chambers also rejected the attempt to throw out the state's votes for Mr. Biden.",
      "What happens if a member of Congress objects to the electoral votes?",
      "This time, it will be nothing more than a complaint. In the last presidential election, a member from each chamber needed to object to the count to force lawmakers to debate and vote on whether to accept or reject a state's results. The Electoral Reform Act, passed by Congress in 2022, raised the threshold to one-fifth of members in each chamber.",

    "summary": "After a party in Hemphill, Texas, Livye Lewis is discovered dead and her ex-boyfriend Matthew Edgar is found bloodied on the ground nearby. What happened along the side of the road where they were discovered?",
    "story": [
      "On Oct. 31, 2020, at around 5 a.m. Livye Lewis was found unresponsive in her car on the side of a road in Hemphill, Texas. Her ex-boyfriend, Matthew Edgar, said he had no memory of what happened to Lewis or how he ended up in the fetal position behind her car.",
      "To find out what happened to Livye, investigators had to retrace her steps from the night before.",
      "2:30 a.m. | A party turned sour",
      "About two hours before Lewis was found in her car, she was at a friend's pre-Halloween party. Edgar, her ex-boyfriend, and his ex-wife, Montana Bockel, were also there. Lewis had broken up with Edgar a few weeks before, and according to the party's host, Bobby Ozan, Lewis and Bockel were enjoying the night while ignoring Edgar.",
      "By 2:30 a.m., most people had already left the party except Lewis and Bockel. According to Bockel's first interview with investigators, Edgar suddenly returned to Ozan's house and overheard that Lewis was going to spend the night with Ozan.",
      "This made Edgar so furious that he started attacking Bockel, feeling she could have stopped Lewis. He was also kicking Bockel's car.",
      "Ozan tried to restrain Edgar, giving Bockel and Lewis a chance to escape. Bockel headed to Edgar's grandparents' home seeking refuge, but it is unclear where Lewis was headed.",
      "Once inside Edgar's grandparents' home, Bockel began texting Edgar. Those texts would become key evidence in the case.",
      "3:34 a.m. | Livye is \"Dead\"",
      "Edgar was angry at Bockel because he said she knew about Lewis and Ozan. Bockel and Lewis had a friendly relationship.",
      "At 3:34 a.m., Bockel texted Edgar asking where Lewis was. He responded: \"Dead.\"",
      "3:30 to 5 a.m. |\u00a0The crime scene",
      "The text messages indicate Edgar was at the scene at around 3:30 a.m.. A pickup truck that belonged to Edgar's cousin was parked behind Lewis' car.",
      "\"I think she pulled over to talk to him and I'll tell you why,\" Sabine County Sheriff's Investigator J.P. MacDonough told \"48 Hours.\" She was just sitting there with her legs crossed. Well, it indicates to me she was not afraid \u2026 It was not a fight or flight thing where she was prepared to just bolt out the car. She was actually, to some degree, comfortable with who she was speaking with.\"",
      "5:15 a.m. | A passerby calls 911",
      "A 911 call was placed around 5:15 a.m. The caller had seen a car on the side of the road and stopped to help. She discovered a grisly scene. Lewis didn't have a pulse. She was dead from a gunshot wound to the neck.",
      "Around 6 a.m | Evidence at the scene",
      "When first responders arrived, they discovered Edgar on the ground. While Edgar was transported to the hospital, investigators processed the scene. They located a rifle in the nearby grass that they later linked to a bullet fragment found inside Lewis' car.",
      "7:39 a.m. | A mother looking for answers",
      "At around 7:30 a.m., Darci Bass arrived at the scene looking for her daughter Livye Lewis. Bass had gotten a call from a friend saying something happened to Lewis.",
      "Bass' interaction with officers at the scene was captured on bodycam footage. She asked at least 23 times where Lewis was, but authorities seemed reluctant to tell her. Finally, once they said Lewis was sitting in her car, Bass dropped to the ground, realizing her daughter had been killed.",
      "7:28 a.m. | Hospital interview with Matthew Edgar",
      "While the scene investigation continued,. MacDonough met with Edgar at the hospital. He captured the entire encounter on bodycam.",
      "A bloodied Edgar claimed he did not remember how he ended up on the ground on the side of the road. After admitting he drank an entire bottle of whiskey the night before, Edgar says the last thing he remembers is falling asleep on his porch and then waking up in the ambulance.",
      "MacDonough informed Edgar that Lewis was found dead in her car. Edgar appears to cry but MacDonough wasn't buying his story. MacDonough arrested Matthew Edgar for Livye Lewis' murder while he was still on that hospital bed.",
      "Around 8:15 a.m. | DNA evidence",
      "While at the hospital MacDonough also gathered Edgar's clothing as evidence. DNA testing revealed a tiny drop of Lewis' blood on Edgar's pants that later became key evidence for prosecutors.",
      "But Edgar's defense attorney, Rob Hughes, argued it was impossible to tell how long the blood had been there.",
      "Jan. 4, 2022: Matthew Edgar's trial begins",
      "Matthew Edgar was free on bail. On Jan. 4, 2022, Edgar went on trial, but he only faced the jury for two days.",
      "On the third day of testimony, Edgar failed to show up to his own murder trial. His mother, Cindy Hogan, informed Hughes that her son was nowhere to be found.",
      "Authorities say Edgar had let the battery on his ankle monitor die and escaped most likely on foot. The trial continued without him, and he was found guilty.",
      "2022 | Where is Matthew Edgar?",
      "With Edgar on the run, Bass put up wanted posters in hopes of finding her daughter's killer.",
      "\"That time was \u2014 was horrible. It was scary. And I thought that he was going to just get away and nobody was looking, and I was having to make wanted posters and go hand 'em out at the flea markets or little events that they had around town, put 'em up in the store windows with people telling me to take it down,\" Bass told \"48 Hours.\"",
      "Dec. 29, 2022 | Matthew Edgar captured",
      "Nearly a year later, U.S. Marshals along with the Sabine County Sheriff's Office and Texas Parks and Wildlife Game Wardens, found and arrested Edgar. It turns out the house where he was found was just yards away from his grandparents' home. Investigators later determined that the home belonged to a family friend. Edgar's mother Cindy Hogan was also found at the house when Edgar was captured.",
      "Jan. 3, 2023 | Matthew Edgar formally sentenced",
      "On Jan. 3, 2023, Edgar was formally sentenced to 99 years in jail with the possibility for parole after 30 years, for the murder of Livye Lewis.",

      "This story was originally posted on March 23. It was updated on Jan. 4, 2025.",
      "In Aurora, Colorado, James Craig was a well-known dentist. He and his wife Angela Craig were raising six children. On March 6, 2023, Angela Craig reported feeling sick and her husband took her to a hospital.",
      "There would be two hectic weeks and three hospital visits. On March 15, Angela Craig was put on life support; three days later, she was dead. Within hours, James Craig would be charged with first-degree murder. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Angela Craig's autopsy revealed she had been poisoned. And police claim the evidence points to her husband \u2014  \u00a0alleging he searched online videos about poison and then purchased potassium cyanide and arsenic.",
      "Podcaster Steffan Tubbs, who covered the case, says police allege in the arrest warrant that James Craig had made a Google search for \"How many grams of pure arsenic will kill a human?\" Authorities believe he went further, lacing his wife's drinks with poison. \"He administered, allegedly the poison via her protein shakes,\" said Tubbs.",
      "Skye Lazaro, an attorney familiar with cases involving poison, tells \"48 Hours\" contributor Natalie Morales that James Craig's defense might argue that police rushed to arrest him. \"It's essentially a three-day investigation,\" she said of the time it took police to charge him with his wife's murder.",
      "James Craig's defense has said he has a history of depression and had sought counseling in the past. Lazaro says they might argue he bought poison not to use on Angela Craig \u2014 but on himself.",
      "As for those allegedly poisoned protein shakes, Lazaro says that from what she's seen of the evidence made public so far, \"The state hasn't presented you any evidence that the poison was actually in the drink,\" she said.",
      "ANGELA CRAIG TEXTS HER HUSBAND \"I FEEL DRUGGED\"",
      "On March 18, 2023, in the Denver suburb of Aurora, Angela Craig died. Just days later, former radio personality Steffan Tubbs began his podcast about the sensational case and the unimaginable news.",
      "STEFFAN TUBBS (\"Arsenic, DDS\" podcast): I want to personally send our condolences to the friends and family of Angela Craig, just 43 years old. She passed away, declared brain dead \u2026 And not lost on me \u2026 is the fact that this family has been temporarily \u2026 destroyed.",
      "James Craig had been almost immediately charged with the first-degree murder of his wife Angela. He has pleaded not guilty. The story of the dentist, his wife and the allegedly poisoned shakes would be told around the world.",
      "Steffan Tubbs: Come on. A dentist. Allegedly ordering potassium cyanide and arsenic. Really?",
      "But it was all as painfully real as a dentist's drill.",
      "Chelsea Otoya: Dr. Craig and Angela Craig were just like two peas in a pod.",
      "Chelsea Otoya: The two of them in the office was cute cause they would play pranks on each other all day long.",

      "Until, according to Colorado police, James took his shot at the perfect crime.",
      "CBS NEWS STREAMING NETWORK: Investigators say he researched poisons in the days leading up to his wife's death.",
      "The idea that the dentist stood accused of murdering Angela, his wife of 23 years, seemed incomprehensible because the Craigs seemed so close.",
      "Chelsea Otoya: It just was heartbreaking for everyone, and I felt bad.",
      "Steffan Tubbs (driving): Coming up on our left, the former home of Summerbrook Dental.",
      "For Tubbs, the office building once home to Summerbrook, has become a tragic touchstone.",

      "Steffan Tubbs: I thought he was a great guy. I got incredibly competent friendly care. \u2026 He was a family man. We talked about his family, his kids \u2026 I \u2014 I met his wife.",
      "Angela Craig was the heart and soul of that family \u2014 mother to their six children and a hands-on partner in what seemed like a thriving business.",
      "Steffan Tubbs: She was not somebody just sit there and stay quiet. She was engaged in the dental practice. \u2026 She was somebody who was talking about ideas, and their marketing, their message.",
      "Tubbs helped refine that message, working on some of Summerbrook's advertising. He witnessed how those two peas in a pod worked side by side, with Angela pitching in as one of Jim's office managers.",
      "Steffan Tubbs: I thought it was kind of cool. You know, you've got a husband and wife, huge family. I thought it was \u2014 it was great to see a small Colorado business operated by, you know, husband and wife.",

      "Steffan Tubbs: This was not the James Craig that I knew.",
      "The James Craig Aurora knew was on display that March 6, 2023, the day Angela's odyssey began. James was at Summerbrook Dental when Angela texted from home: \"My eyes don't want to focus.\" She texted \"I feel drugged.\"",

      "George Brauchler: That's right. March 6th was her first time into the hospital.",
      "At the time, George Brauchler was another force in Colorado talk radio.",
      "He is also the former elected district attorney for Arapahoe County, where Angela Craig lived and would die, rattling this community.",
      "George Brauchler: This is a huge story.",
      "Like Tubbs, Brauchler has immersed himself in the details of Angela's final days\u2014a desperate two-week ordeal. But on that March 6, as the hours passed in the ER, there were lots of questions, but few answers.",
      "George Brauchler: They really didn't have a good answer for what she was going through and \u2026 they end up releasing her and sending her home.",
      "Home \u2014 where Angela Craig appeared to think she was safe in her marriage. At least that's how she sounded in messages the couple sent each other, with Angela now home, recuperating from her ER visit.",

      "\"I'm not feeling anything.\" Angela Craig replies. \"Don't bring anything, I'll eat something here.\"",
      "Within 24 hours, Angela Craig's symptoms came back fast and strong. She headed back to Parker Adventist. This time she would be admitted.",
      "Steffan Tubbs: The doctors and nurses are trying. They're conducting tests. \u2026 They just cannot figure out what is ailing this relatively normal and healthy 43-year-old woman.",
      "George Brauchler: All the steps that the doctors and medical staff had taken seemed to not be working. \u2026 it was a real mystery.",
      "UNRAVELING A MEDICAL MYSTERY",
      "Steffan Tubbs: There was nothing that would be even remotely a red flag, or this is a rocky, troubled marriage. None of that at all.",
      "With Angela Craig still terribly sick, in March 2023 she was back at Parker Adventist a second time, now as an admitted patient. According to the warrant during her stay, Angela Craig texted her husband James Craig to say, \"Now I'm hungry\" and he texted back later that was bringing food, writing \"Ok I gotchu.\"",
      "George Brauchler: The loving husband who wants to see his wife remain healthy.",
      "That arrest warrant contains numerous texts detailing how as Angela Craig was hospitalized, James Craig went back and forth from their home to her bedside to Summerbrook \u2014 a husband seemingly supporting his wife and caring for their kids.",
      "Steffan Tubbs: He's continuing to go to work, and I don't begrudge him for that. He's got a family of six kids.",
      "And the warrant would show that apparent trust that Angela Craig placed in James, how she reached out to him to share her symptoms, texting, \"I'm cold, super tired, weak, shaky and dizzy\"",
      "And James Craig sent compassionate texts to Angela Craig: \"I love you and miss you and I'm so worried. I wish you were healthy enough to come home tonight and snuggle me.\"",

      "George Brauchler: Struggling to figure out what in the hell is causing this. What is making her sick?",
      "Steffan Tubbs: And they just could not get an answer.",
      "As Angela Craig stayed in the hospital without a diagnosis, James Craig was in touch with his friends Michelle and Ryan Redfearn.. Ryan Redfearn, a fellow dentist, had recently become business partners with James Craig, he would later tell police.",
      "George Brauchler: Ryan Redfearn went to dental school with Jim Craig all those 20-plus years ago. He'd known him all that time. \u2026 He was a close confidant.",
      "And with Angela Craig so sick, according to the warrant, James Craig also texted with Ryan's wife, Michelle Redfearn, trained as a nurse.",
      "Natalie Morales: What were they texting about?",
      "George Brauchler: The texts were really the kinds of things you would exchange with someone who's another medical professional. I mean, he was talking about blood pressure. He was talking about concerns the doctors had expressed about symptomology \u2026 that should have resolved by now.",
      "But one of James Craig's texts, in retrospect, seemed odd, as it appeared he was making light of Angela's mysterious illness.",
      "Steffan Tubbs: Jim Craig texts Michelle Redfearn, quote, \"If it wasn't my wife, this would be kind of a fun puzzle to try to work out, exclamation point.\" Who says that?",
      "Still, a bad joke in times of crisis isn't unusual, says \u00a0former DA \u00a0Brauchler.",
      "George Brauchler: Everybody reacts to trauma differently.",
      "And James Craig seemed worried. It had been four hectic days since Angela was admitted. Police say Jim told others he was sleeping on a stool next to Angela that night when her vital signs crashed. Doctors responded through the night.",
      "Steffan Tubbs: I have thought about every agonizing minute that Angela Craig was in.",
      "But over the next day Angela Craig seemed to stabilize. And on March 14,\u00a0 still with no answers as to why she was sick, Angela was released from Parker Adventist. Once again, Angela Craig came home to her husband of 23 years. But she wouldn't be home for long. Within a day she started feeling sick again.",
      "On March 15, she was admitted to nearby University Hospital. There would be more tubes, tests and monitors. James Craig was soon by her side.",
      "Steffan Tubbs: They had no idea what was wrong with her.",
      "Police say James Craig didn't stay long at first. Within half an hour, he drove home from the hospital. Then about an hour-and-a-half later, he returned, carrying food. Police say he then went into Angela Craig's room, alone. Soon after, Angela Craig had a seizure and once again her vital signs crashed.",
      "George Brauchler: It was critical.",
      "James Craig took photos of his wife as hospital staff tried to save her.",
      "George Brauchler: She is getting into dire, dire medical consequences.",
      "Angela Craig, once so full of life, was put on life support.",
      "George Brauchler: Doctors are struggling to figure out what in the hell is causing this? What is making her sick?",
      "What medical staff didn't know at the time was that days earlier, according to police, a package had arrived at James Craig's office. Authorities say what was in that package, ordered by James Craig himself, would become key evidence in this case. James Craig allegedly told a staff member \"that he would be receiving a personal package\" and \"not to open it.\"",
      "Steffan Tubbs: Jim Craig had said don't open this package. Somebody did. She sees the words \"potassium cyanide.\"",
      "Steffan Tubbs: Why are we getting potassium cyanide to a Colorado dentist's office?",
      "A PACKAGE MARKED POISON",
      "Angela Craig was on life support and fighting to survive. James Craig texted the photos he took to Michelle Redfearn, writing \"crash\" \"intubated\" and \"doc says she's 'very very worried'.\" The couple raced to the hospital.",
      "Ryan Redfearn would later tell police he watched as James Craig broke down.",
      "Natalie Morales: He saw Craig crying after speaking to doctors about Angela's prognosis.",
      "George Brauchler: Yep. He did say he saw him crying afterwards.",
      "But according to police, Ryan Redfearn was far from convinced those tears were real. That's because, on his way to the hospital, he had gotten a call from a staff member at the office. The call was to alert Ryan Redfearn about that package marked potassium cyanide that had arrived at Summerbrook Dental \u2014 allegedly addressed and later given to James Craig.",
      "Steffan Tubbs: And there's the dominoes that are now falling one after the other.",
      "Ryan Redfearn led the way.",
      "George Brauchler: He does what any other normal person would do.",
      "According to police, while Angela Craig was on life support, Ryan Redfearn tells a nurse that James Craig \"recently ordered Potassium Cyanide,\" adding that there was no medical reason or purpose to order Potassium Cyanide for a dental practice.\"",
      "Steffan Tubbs: The nurse, being a mandatory reporter, calls Aurora police, and I mean it's like that. Within five hours, probably even less, there is a member of the homicide unit with Aurora P.D. is at University Hospital.",
      "Police started asking questions. Then, according to the warrant, \"Ryan received a call from James's personal cell phone.\"",
      "Natalie Morales: Tell me about that phone call.",
      "George Brauchler: I think Ryan and his wife are in the parking lot of the hospital when Jim calls them.",
      "According to police, James Craig asked Ryan Redfearn \"if he had said anything to the hospital staff.\" Ryan Redfearn confirmed that he had and told James Craig that he knew what James Craig had ordered. And James Craig replied that the \"package was a ring for Angela and that he wanted to surprise her.\"",
      "George Brauchler: And Ryan \u2026 says, \"\u2026 it's not a ring, we know what was in there.\" I mean this is a testament to Ryan Redfearn.",
      "A decades-long friendship was about to be tested, then shattered. This tale was once again told in a text, revealed in that warrant, as the next morning James Craig pleaded with his pal and partner, texting in part: \"I want to make an urgent plea to you. \u2026 please don't talk to anyone \u2026 including any law enforcement officers. You are under no obligation to answer their questions unless you are served a subpoena and you will do more damage than good to my family by continuing to insert yourself into this.\"",
      "Natalie Morales: How damning is that text in itself?",
      "George Brauchler: I'm trying to think of all the innocent applications of the phrase, please don't talk to the police. I can't come up with any.",
      "George Brauchler: It's a desperate effort to try to keep Ryan from cooperating any farther with law enforcement.",
      "But if that's what he was trying to do, it was too late. Police had already launched their investigation.",
      "On March 18, 2023, Angela Craig was taken off life support. A friend, wife, and mother of six was dead.",
      "Chelsea Otoya: I was in complete shock, in complete disbelief. \u2026 In my head, I'm like, this is crazy, it's not true.",
      "Chelsea Otoya: I thought maybe it was an accident.",
      "But investigators didn't think so. Just hours after Angela Craig died, Dr. James Craig would be arrested and charged with the first-degree murder of his wife.",
      "Steffan Tubbs: There's my dentist, a mugshot.",
      "James Craig would plead not guilty. Months later, Angela Craig's autopsy would be released. That autopsy states Angela Craig died from \"lethal concentrations of cyanide\" and \"a lethal concentration\" of tetrahydrozoline, the chemical found in some eye drops. And it says that Angela Craig had \"toxic concentrations\" of arsenic in her blood in those two earlier hospital visits.",
      "Steffan Tubbs: To think about what Angela Craig endured. \u2026 This woman was in agony, dying, for so long.",
      "Just a week before Angela Craig got sick, according to the warrant, James Craig set up a new email account using the alias \"Jim and Waffles\" and used it to research multiple poisons \u2014 all part of his plan, according to investigators, to murder Angela Craig.",
      "Steffan Tubbs: One particular Google search, \"how many grams of pure arsenic will kill a human?\"",
      "James Craig, investigators say, also found videos online with titles like \"Top 5 Undetectable Poisons That Show No Sign Of Foul Play.\"",
      "And police say on the same day he did that online research, James Craig made a purchase \u2014 arsenic \u2014 and had it delivered straight to his family's mailbox.",
      "George Brauchler: I think he legitimately believed that he would be able to poison his wife, she would die, he would have her cremated. And then they'd \u2026 move on.",
      "Poison. Some call it the recipe for the perfect crime. A silent, invisible killer \u2014 no blood, no gun, no fingerprints. Even doctors can have a hard time spotting it.",

      "So \"48 Hours\" asked him, and Dr. LaPoint focused in on the alleged actions of James Craig\u00a0 and the final days of Angela Craig's life.",
      "He reviewed the arrest warrant for us, and some of the deadly drugs it lists.",
      "Natalie Morales: Let's start with arsenic.",
      "Dr. Jeff LaPoint: OK \u2026 yeah, arsenic is a very famous poison. It's \u2026 not detectable by taste or odor.",
      "LaPoint says Angela Craig's symptoms in those first two hospital visits are consistent with arsenic poisoning.",
      "Dr. Jeff LaPoint: Nausea and vomiting.",
      "Natalie Morales: Lower blood pressure, higher blood pressure?",
      "Dr. Jeff LaPoint: Generally lower.",
      "Natalie Morales: How much would kill a person?",
      "Dr. Jeff LaPoint: It does not take very much.",
      "But police say there was more. A week after he purchased that arsenic, they allege James Craig \u2014 as \"Jim and Waffles\"\u2014 went back online. He ordered a second poison.",
      "Natalie Morales: Oleandrin, what is that?",
      "Dr. Jeff LaPoint: So, oleandrin is a toxin found in oleander.",
      "Natalie Morales: I'm thinking of those white flowers.",
      "Jeff LaPoint: Yeah, they're really beautiful.",
      "As lovely as a rose. Only deadly.",
      "Dr. Jeff LaPoint: It prevents the heart from beating very efficiently.",

      "Cyanide is so deadly that you need a medical license to buy it. And police say that when Dr. James Craig placed his order from a medical supply company, he stated he needed it for a complex dental procedure.",

      "WAS INTEREST IN ANOTHER WOMAN A MOTIVE FOR MURDER?",
      "Detectives suspected James Craig had bought all those poisons to kill his wife, but they wanted to know why. They would find a lead miles away from Aurora on a trip James Craig made \u2014 and a woman he met \u2014 just before Angela Craig got sick.",

      "It was Feb. 23, a week-and-a-half before Angela Craig first went to the hospital. The doctor was traveling alone. And he rolled the dice.",

      "Steffan Tubbs: They hit it off \u2026 it's a whirlwind.",
      "A few weeks later, according to the warrant, Cain would fly to Colorado and rendezvous at a hotel with James Craig. He would use that newly created email, \"Jim and Waffles,\" to flirt with her.",
      "Skye Lazaro: It's not illegal to have affairs.",
      "Skye Lazaro is an experienced defense attorney familiar with cases involving poison. James Craig and his attorney declined our request for an interview. Lazaro reviewed the case against James Craig for \"48 Hours.\" And she identified potential weaknesses.",
      "Skye Lazaro: Is it reasonable that you would kill your wife to be with someone that you had had a 10-day relationship with?",
      "Natalie Morales: The common defense strategy is affairs do not make a murderer.",
      "Skye Lazaro: Right. \u2026 One doesn't automatically mean you did the other.",
      "At the time she visited James Craig in Colorado, Cain did seem to know Angela Craig was very sick and in the hospital. In fact, she had sent a concerned e-mail to James Craig. It read in part: \"Hi honey, I am so sorry for what has transpired this week in your world. \u2026 I am praying for you and seeking God's wisdom for this time. I love you.\"",
      "But there is no evidence to suggest Cain knew anything more.",
      "George Brauchler:\u00a0 Nothing that I have seen \u2026 gives any indication that she knew that Jim was trying to kill his wife.",

      "Steffan Tubbs: He gives the standard male, typical, \"I'm going through a divorce.\" No, he's not.",
      "And a detective said she told them her relationship with James Craig was \"intimate but not sexual.\" Cain sent \"48 Hours\" an email, writing: \"I had absolutely nothing to do with this horrific 'crime' and 'my heart is absolutely broken for Angela Craig and her family.'\" And she says she is \"cooperating fully with the police and prosecution.\"",
      "Steffan Tubbs: Karin Cain \u2026 met the wrong guy at the wrong time. \u2026 She didn't know anything.",
      "Tubbs and Brauchler imply maybe no one knew anything about who James Craig really was. His pristine image \u2014 loving parent, church member, dedicated husband\u2014now all being questioned. And as cops continued to investigate, another possible motive emerged.",

      "George Brauchler: Jim had liabilities in excess of $2 million and we know that from some of the bankruptcy filings.",
      "But Lazaro says she's not convinced those financial problems give James Craig a motive for murder.",
      "Natalie Morales: Is this sort of the portrait of a desperate man?",
      "Skye Lazaro: Not necessarily.",
      "Skye Lazaro: We see businesses go through bankruptcy all the time and come out the other side.",
      "And, as for any poisons he may have ordered, Lazaro states those purchases may not even be illegal.",
      "Skye Lazaro: He can legitimately purchase it because he has a DEA number.",
      "Natalie Morales: As a doctor. As a dentist, right.",
      "Skye Lazaro: Right.",
      "Skye Lazaro: Just having it isn't murder.",
      "Natalie Morales: Mm-hmm. Administering it. Right.",
      "But according to the arrest paperwork, James Craig might have thought he had that figured out, too. Authorities say he could have slipped the poison into one of those protein shakes he so often made.",
      "Natalie Morales: A morning routine at home for example.",
      "George Brauchler: Yeah.",
      "On that morning of March\u00a0 15 \u2014 the day Angela Craig would finally crash before she was taken to the hospital, she was home with James Craig. Investigators say that's when he may have made her one of those protein shakes and laced it with potassium cyanide.",
      "George Brauchler: It is tasteless. It is odorless. It is colorless. It is really hidable inside something like a shake.",
      "Natalie Morales: And highly lethal.",
      "George Brauchler: Highly lethal.",
      "But attorney Lazaro counters the evidence may not be there. She has reviewed the transcripts from that July 2023 preliminary hearing and says there's nothing there that shows James Craig put poison in Angela Craig's shakes.",
      "Skye Lazaro: They went and tested everything in the house and didn't find any trace evidence of there being arsenic or cyanide or anything in the protein powder, in the protein bottles.",
      "Skye Lazaro: The state hasn't presented you any evidence that the poison was actually in the drinks.",
      "And Lazaro says the defense can paint a picture of James Craig as a kind and attentive partner.",
      "Skye Lazaro: Jim's text messages to Angela are extremely loving and extremely caring. He repeatedly asks her how she's doing. He tells her he loves her.",
      "So if James Craig didn't poison his wife, who did? He had a story to tell about that.",
      "WHAT ANGELA CRAIG'S AUTOPSY SHOWED",
      "As Steffan Tubbs reported on his podcast, there may be another story to tell about James Craig and what happened to Angela Craig. The story wasn't about murder; it was about suicide.",
      "STEFFAN TUBBS (podcast): Craig says to the business partner on the phone \u2026 she was just playing chicken.",
      "According to the warrant, when Ryan Redfearn confronted James Craig about the cyanide, James Craig allegedly said that Angela Craig asked him to order it for her. That it was all a dare\u2014kind of a deadly game of \"chicken.\"",
      "Steffan Tubbs: According to Jim Craig \u2026 She's been threatening suicide. And this game of chicken is \u2026 Now \u2026 are you gonna take it?",
      "But according to that 52-page warrant, none of Angela Craig's family members told police she was suicidal. A more likely argument for the defense, says Lazaro, is that James Craig had been looking for cyanide not to kill Angela \u2014 but to kill himself.",
      "Skye Lazaro: There was some statements that he, in fact, was suicidal, not her.",
      "At that preliminary hearing in 2023, James Craig's defense team said he had spoken to a friend about his own past plans to die by suicide, and that \"Dr. Craig had made a statement\" to that friend that he was going to die by \"suicide with something that was not traceable.\" The defense pointed out that James Craig \"suffered from depression\" and went to counseling in the past.",
      "And, the defense indicated, James Craig told Angela Craig at one point that he had actually drugged her years earlier, when he had tried to kill himself \u2014 hoping that while she was drugged, she wouldn't be able stop him.",
      "Natalie Morales: It sounds like there had been something that he had tried before with her.",
      "Skye Lazaro: Mm-hmm. ... That he had drugged her, so that she would fall asleep, so that he could go \u2026 essentially kill himself. And she wouldn't be there to render any aid or call for help.",
      "And remember when Angela Craig first started feeling sick, and she texted James Craig: \"I feel drugged\"? James Craig's defense points out that he texted back, \"Given our history, I know that must be triggering. Just for the record, I didn't drug you.\" The defense said this text supports the story of James Craig's past depression and suicide attempts.",
      "But Lazaro says it's unlikely the defense would try to tell a jury that Jim and Angela Craig were both trying to die by suicide.",
      "Skye Lazaro: You have to pick one at some point.",
      "Natalie Morales: Mm-hmm.",
      "Skye Lazaro: And it's either she's suicidal \u2026 or that he's suicidal \u2026 and this is why he bought the drugs.",
      "But perhaps the most compelling evidence authorities say they have is what Angela Craig left behind in her own blood. That autopsy revealed something investigators find remarkable\u2014the levels of cyanide in Angela Craig's body actually increased while she was in the hospital on that final day. The possible implication?",
      "Tubbs wonders if prosecutors will contend James Craig gave his wife more poison in the hospital.",
      "Steffan Tubbs: If the allegations are true, this is about as cruel as it gets. Period.",
      "James Craig's defense has hired its own toxicologist. And, come his trial for murder, Lazaro says James Craig, innocent until proven guilty, may himself be portrayed as a victim \u2014   of cops too eager to make a fast arrest.",
      "Skye Lazaro: It's essentially a three-day investigation.",
      "James Craig's quick arrest, she says, could be a weakness for the state.",
      "Skye Lazaro: You decided from the get-go that this had to be poisoning \u2026 This was the foregone conclusion. \u2026 So you never went and looked for anything else.",
      "And as for that idea that poison might be the key to someone trying to commit the perfect crime, toxicologist Dr. Jeff LaPoint says that is just plain wrong.",

    "summary": "On a lakeside peninsula in Eastern Africa, archaeologists have found clues about a society that lived there over 3 million years ago.",
    "story": [
      "On a lakeside peninsula in Eastern Africa, archaeologists have found clues about a society that lived there over 3 million years ago.",
      "The Homa Peninsula, in Kenya, is part of the East African Rift Valley, a part of the world often called \"the cradle of humankind.\" So many of the oldest clues about humanity's earliest days have been preserved under the valley's fertile, human soil, including the remains of \"Lucy,\" an ancient human relative who lived more than 3 million years ago.",
      "Tom Plummer and his team are the latest to make discoveries in the area, working at a site on the peninsula called Nyanga. The team found flakes, or little knives, at the dig site. The blades are believed to be some of the first tools ever used on Earth \u2014 and even after more than 3 million years, they still have a sharp edge.",
      "Plummer, an archaeologist at the City University of New York, said the blades were made by hammering one stone against each other. The knives would have been used to peel and cut fruits and vegetables, and to cut the flesh off prey like hippos, Plummer said. The meat would then be pounded between stones to tenderize it. The knife and stones are known as the Oldowan tool kit, and likely set the stage for further technology advancement down the line.",
      "\"I \u00a0think the Oldowan technology is probably the most important technological innovation that ever happened in human history,\" Plummer told \"CBS Saturday Morning.\"",
      "\"It allowed (the pre-human ancestors) to access a whole array of foods that they would never have had access to before.\"",
      "Plummer said that new diet would have fueled body and brain growth, starting a \"feedback loop\" that created more sophisticated beings who \"start doing more with technology.\" An similar, even older cutting tool was also found in Kenya, but that technology apparently died out, so Plummer believes this tool is the one that can be credited for those developments.",
      "\"I think that's all starting with the Oldowan,\" Plummer said.",
      "Who made the tools is another surprise. Along with the tools, Plummer's team found the tooth of a paranthropus, an early hominin that is not a direct ancestor of humans. That suggests that the first tool making is not a human legacy, but an idea humanity's ancestors copied, then used to dominate other hominins, who ultimately died out.",
      "Rick Potts, the director of the Smithsonian's human origins program and the leader of research on the peninsula, said that discovery can help frame humans' existence on the planet.",
      "\"We are the last biped standing, as I call it,\" Potts said. \"All of those other ways of life became extinct. And so that gives us a lot to think about, and it draws attention to the fragility of life, even in our own journey through time.\"",
      "Searching for pre-human history",
      "The search for these early artifacts has the look and intrigue of an \"Indiana Jones\" film. Finding the splintered rocks that showed evidence of being used as tools was one thing, but the archaeology team then had to find the cut marks on animal bones that confirmed how the knives were being used.",
      "Blasto Onyango, a local archaeological legend who helped uncover the Turkana Boy, the most complete early hominin skeleton ever discovered, said that his impressive find took \"four or five years\" to find. As the time passed, he and other archaeologists found \"different parts of the\" skeleton, working slowly but surely to uncover the remains of a young boy who lived over one and a half million years ago.",
      "Paleontology researcher Rose Nyaboke said that kind of painstaking, slow research is what makes up the day-to-day work of an archaeology dig. Sometimes, she and other researchers find small pieces of bone, but have to leave those fragments where they were found.",
      "\"We don't just pick anything. It has to have a paleontological meaning,\" Nyaboke explained. \"We tell it 'Sorry. We can't pick you today.'\"",
      "The bones that matter are ones that can lend context to the area, such as pig's teeth. Pigs evolved so quickly their skeletons help date the surrounding area. The site is too old for carbon dating, and the ancient volcanic ash that has preserved the artifacts makes other dating methods too hard to use. The area had actually been mostly abandoned by researchers after artifacts from the Homa Peninsula led to inaccurate claims about human origins. Despite all that, Potts started digging on the peninsula nearly 40 years ago.",
      "\"We found a place that's difficult to date, but we didn't leave, because science takes persistence,\" Potts said.",
      "That persistence has been rewarded with discoveries like Plummer's. New technologies have made the sites easier to date, and new discoveries across eastern Africa have refined researchers' understanding of human roots. Researchers knew that modern homo sapiens emerged in Africa about 300,000 years ago, but it wasn't until recently that they understood that their hominin ancestors began walking on two legs at least 6 million years ago.",
      "\"Some of the things that we thought occurred in a very short period of time, within the last one million years, are now stretched out over a 6 million year period,\" Potts said. \"That includes tool making.\"",

      "French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot and his German counterpart Annalena Baerbock were in the Syrian capital for talks on behalf of the European Union, in the highest-level visit by major Western powers since Islamist-led forces toppled longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad last month.",
      "One of their first stops was the notorious Sednaya prison, not far from the capital.",
      "Accompanied by White Helmet rescuers, Barrot and Baerbock toured the cells and underground dungeons of Sednaya, which for decades stood as a fearsome symbol of the atrocities committed against Assad's opponents.",
      "The prison was the site of extrajudicial executions, torture and forced disappearances. An advocacy group said more than 4,000 people were freed from the detention facility when rebel forces took Damascus on December 8. Countless other inmates \u2014 both criminals and Assad opponents \u2014 simply vanished after being incarcerated there.",
      "In 2017, the U.S. State Department said the Assad regime was using a crematorium at Sednaya to dispose of dead bodies in an effort to \"cover up\" the mass murders it was carrying out there.",
      "\"Fragile hope\" for a \"stable and peaceful\" Syria",
      "Sharaa, head of the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), led the offensive that toppled Assad. The HTS-dominated interim authorities now face the daunting task of rebuilding state institutions, with growing calls to ensure an inclusive transition and guarantee minority rights.",
      "Barrot, in Damascus, expressed hope for a \"sovereign, stable and peaceful\" Syria.",
      "It was also a \"hope that the aspirations of all Syrians can be realized,\" he added, \"but it is a fragile hope.\"",
      "In a statement, Baerbock said Germany wanted to help Syria become a \"safe home\" for all its people, and a \"functioning state, with full control over its territory.\"",
      "She said the visit was a \"clear signal\" to Damascus of the possibility for a new relationship between Syria and Germany, and Europe more broadly.",
      "The European diplomats' closed meeting with Sharaa on Friday lasted about an hour and a half, and they did not give formal statements to journalists afterward.",
      "Earlier, in a post in X, Barrot said: \"Together, France and Germany stand alongside the Syrian people, in all their diversity.\"",
      "He added that the two European powers wanted to promote a \"peaceful transition\" to a new government in the country.",
      "Despite \"skepticism\" about HTS \u2014 which was previously the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda and remains designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. and numerous other governments \u2014 Baerbock said that \"we must not miss the opportunity to support the Syrian people at this important crossroads.\"",
      "Sharaa has distanced himself and HTS from al-Qaeda in recent years, and the group's public statements have suggested plans to respect Syria's myriad religious groups.",
      "The Biden administration said after Assad fled to Russia that the U.S. could recognize a new Syrian government under certain conditions. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the new leadership and the transition process must ensure the protection of Syria's minority groups, a flow of humanitarian aid into the country, prevent Syria from being used as a base for terrorist organizations, and help ensure that any chemical and biological weapons are secured and destroyed.",
      "Baerbock said Friday that Berlin stood ready to support \"an inclusive and peaceful transfer of power\" as well as social \"reconciliation\" in Syria.",
      "She also asked the new regime to avoid \"acts of vengeance against groups within the population,\" to avoid a long delay before elections, and to avert any attempts at the \"Islamization\" of the judicial and education systems.",
      "Since Assad's ousting, a bevy of foreign envoys have travelled to Damascus to meet with the country's new leaders. France and Germany had both already sent lower-level delegations last month.",
      "At the start of his visit, Barrot met with representatives of Syria's Christian communities. Diplomatic sources said Barrot told the Christian leaders that France was committed to a pluralistic Syria with equal rights for all, including minority groups.",
      "Syria's civil war \u2014 which started in 2011 with the Assad government's brutal repression of pro-democracy protests \u2014 saw Germany, France and a host of other countries shutter their diplomatic missions in Damascus.",
      "The conflict killed more than 500,000 people, displaced millions and left Syria fragmented and ravaged.",
      "The new authorities have called for the lifting of sanctions imposed on Syria under Assad to allow for reconstruction.",
      "Paris is due to host an international summit on Syria later this month, following a similar meeting in December in Jordan.",

    "summary": "Authorities say there's \"been no sign of\" a local surfer seen being attacked by a shark off South Australia's coast.",
    "story": [
      "Wellington, New Zealand\u00a0\u2014 A surfer missing in Australia is believed to have died in a shark attack, authorities said Friday, as they searched the waters where the man disappeared. The 28-year-old was in the sea at a popular surf beach in South Australia where another man was killed by a white shark in 2023.",
      "A witness who saw the shark attack on Thursday evening at Granites Beach, near the coastal town of Streaky Bay, rode into the sea on a jet ski and retrieved the man's surfboard, Senior Constable Rebecca Stokes told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "\"But there was just no sign of this young man, there's just been no sign of him,\" Stokes told the ABC. \"From witnesses' descriptions we're pretty confident that sadly he's been killed by this shark.\"",
      "The beach was known to be frequented by sharks, Stokes said. She did not specify what species of shark was believed to be involved.",
      "Emergency responders and volunteers were searching offshore on Friday for the local man and the beach was closed to the public. Police were preparing a coroner's report, a statement said.",
      "Shark attacks in Australia are rare, with 255 fatal bites recorded since 1791 in the country of 27 million people, according to the Australian Shark Incident Database.",
      "But the state of South Australia has registered more episodes in the past two years than usual. There were five shark attacks off the state's coast in 2023, three of them fatal and one at the same beach as Thursday's incident.",
      "Scientists at the time said they did not know the reason for the cluster. There was one non-fatal shark bite off South Australia's coast in 2024.",
      "Another Australian surfer made a remarkable return to the waves late last year after suffering a serious shark attack over the summer off the coast of the neighboring New South Wales state. Kai McKenzie lost his right leg to a 15-foot white shark on July 23, but he vowed not only to surf again, but to return to the same spot where he was attacked.",
      "In mid-October, less than three months after he lost his leg, he made good on the promise, as documented on his own Instagram feed.",
      "Researchers published a study in November that found bright lights on surf boards could actually help to prevent shark attacks, likely by making the boards and their riders appear less like seals to the predators.",

    "summary": "South Korean investigators left the official residence of impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol after a near-six-hour standoff during which he defied their attempt to detain him.",
    "story": [
      "Seoul, South Korea \u2014 South Korean investigators left the official residence of impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol after a near-six-hour standoff during which he defied their attempt to detain him. It's the latest confrontation in a political crisis that has paralyzed South Korean politics and seen two heads of state impeached in under a month.",
      "The country's anti-corruption agency said it withdrew its investigators after the presidential security service blocked them from entering Yoon's residence for hours due to concerns about their safety.",
      "The agency said its outnumbered investigators had several scuffles with presidential security forces and expressed \"serious regret about the attitude of the suspect, who did not comply with the legal process.\"",
      "The National Police Agency said it planned to investigate the chief and deputy chiefs of the presidential security service on suspicion of obstructing official duty and summoned them for questioning on Saturday.",
      "Yoon, a former prosecutor, has defied investigators' attempts to question him for weeks. The last time he is known to have left the residence was on Dec. 12, when he went to the nearby presidential office to make a televised statement to the nation, making a defiant statement that he will fight efforts to oust him.",
      "Investigators from the country's anti-corruption agency are weighing charges of rebellion after Yoon, apparently frustrated that his policies were blocked by an opposition-dominated parliament, declared martial law on Dec. 3 and dispatched troops to surround the National Assembly.",
      "Parliament overturned the declaration within hours in an unanimous vote and impeached Yoon on Dec. 14, accusing him of rebellion, while South Korean anti-corruption authorities and public prosecutors opened separate investigations into the events.",
      "A Seoul court issued a warrant for Yoon's detention on Tuesday, but enforcing it is complicated as long as he remains in his official residence.",
      "Yoon's lawyers, who filed a challenge to the warrant on Thursday, say it cannot be enforced at his residence due to a law that protects locations potentially linked to military secrets from search without the consent of the person in charge.",
      "The office said it will discuss further actions, but did not immediately say whether it would make another attempt to detain Yoon. The warrant for his detention is valid for one week.",
      "Yoon's lawyers have also argued that the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials, which is leading a joint investigation with police and military investigators, lacks the authority to investigate rebellion charges. They said police officers don't have the legal authority to assist in detaining Yoon, and could face arrest by either the \"presidential security service or any citizens.\" They didn't elaborate further on the claim.",
      "If investigators manage to detain Yoon, they will likely ask a court for permission to make a formal arrest. Otherwise, he will be released after 48 hours.",
      "Park Chan-dae, floor leader of the liberal opposition Democratic Party, called the anti-corruption agency's withdrawal regrettable and urged the agency to make another attempt to detain Yoon on Friday.",
      "Kwon Young-se, who heads the emergency leadership committee of Yoon's conservative People Power Party, called the agency's effort to detain Yoon \"highly unfair and exceedingly improper,\" saying there is no risk of Yoon attempting to flee or to destroy evidence.",
      "Thousands of police officers gathered at Yoon's residence on Friday, forming a perimeter around a growing group of pro-Yoon protesters who braved freezing temperatures for hours, waving South Korean and American flags while chanting slogans vowing to protect him. There were no immediate reports of major clashes outside the residence.",
      "Dozens of investigators and police officers were seen entering the gate of the residence in Seoul to execute a warrant for Yoon's detention, but the dramatic scene quickly developed into a standoff. Two of Yoon's lawyers, Yoon Kap-keun and Kim Hong-il, were seen entering the gate of the presidential residence around noon. It wasn't immediately clear what the lawyers discussed with the president.",
      "Seok Dong-hyeon, another lawyer on Yoon's legal team, said the agency's efforts to detain Yoon were \"reckless\" and showed an \"outrageous discard for law.\"",
      "South Korea's Defense Ministry confirmed that the investigators and police officers got past a military unit guarding the residence's grounds before arriving at the building. The presidential security service, which controls the residence itself, refused to comment. South Korea's YTN television reported scuffles as investigators and police confronted the presidential security forces.",
      "As the standoff progressed, the Democrats called on the country's acting leader, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, to order the presidential security service to stand down. Choi didn't immediately comment on the situation.",
      "\"Do not drag the upright staff of the presidential security service and other public officials into the depths of crime,\" said Jo Seung-lae, a Democratic lawmaker. Choi must \"remember that swiftly addressing the rebellion and preventing further chaos is your responsibility,\" Jo said.",
      "Yoon's defense minister, police chief and several top military commanders have already been arrested over their roles in the period of martial law.",
      "Yoon's presidential powers have been suspended since the National Assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14. Yoon's fate now lies with the Constitutional Court, which has begun deliberations on whether to uphold the impeachment and formally remove Yoon from office or reinstate him. At least six justices on the nine-member Constitutional Court must vote in favor to remove him from office.",
      "The National Assembly voted last week to impeach Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who became acting president after Yoon's powers were suspended, over his reluctance to fill three Constitutional Court vacancies ahead of the court's review of Yoon's case.",
      "Facing growing pressure, the new acting president, Choi, appointed two new justices on Tuesday, which could increase the chances of the court upholding Yoon's impeachment.",

    "story": [
      "China on Thursday said it was adding dozens of American companies to its export control list to \"safeguard national security and interests.\"",
      "China's Ministry of Commerce said it would impose measures on 28 U.S. entities and would also prohibit exports of dual-use items to the listed companies starting on Thursday, reported the Global Times, a Chinese daily viewed as aligned with Beijing, and the government-run Xinhua news agency. Dual-use items refers to those that can be used for either civilian or military purposes.",
      "China also sanctioned 10 defense firms on Thursday over military sales to Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims as its own, adding them to China's \"Unreliable Entities List,\" the ministry said, according to AFP.",
      "\"It really does seem to be a warning shot \u2014 that escalation in U.S. policies against China, particularly under Trump, will be met with a more aggressive response,\" Jesse Schreger, an associate professor of Macroeconomics at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"China is signaling it will not take tariffs passively.\"",
      "The threat to not sell dual-use goods to listed companies could be consequential, given China's role as the world's manufacturing powerhouse, said Schreger. Unclear is how China intends to enforce the measures and which products will be viewed as dual use and therefore have their sales restricted. Tires, for instance, could be viewed as produced for both civilian and military use, he noted.",
      "The moves come as Beijing readies for the return of President-elect Donald Trump to the White House and after the Biden administration broadened its restrictions on Chinese firms amid an escalating back-and-forth. During his presidential campaign, Trump also raised the idea of imposing a\u00a0tariff of up to 60%\u00a0on all Chinese goods.",
      "\"The desire to put high tariffs on China seems credible, if you think back to the first Trump administration and its willingness to use [tariffs] for geopolitical ends,\" offered Schreger. \"The Biden administration didn't undo that \u2014 in fact, they professionalized it. The Trump administration's rhetoric might have been stronger, but the Biden administration took this economic battle to the next level.\"",
      "China last month said it was investigating U.S. microchip maker Nvidia over potential violations of Chinese anti-monopoly laws.",
      "China's action comes less than a week after it\u00a0placed\u00a0sanctions on seven companies in responding to recently announced U.S. military sales and aid to Taiwan.",
      "Still, sanctions by Beijing targeting American defense companies tend to have a muted impact given that U.S. military firms don't sell arms or related goods to China. The tit-for-tat trade measures also could be limited, some analysts think.",
      "\"Changes to immigration, trade and fiscal policy under the second Trump administration will likely be meaningful but stop short of some of the more dramatic proposals,\" stated Goldman Sachs analysts in a recent report. \"We expect tariffs on imports from China and autos, but not a universal tariff, which would carry economic and political risks that we think the White House will prefer to avoid.\"",
      "The Associated Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "It is hoped the discovery will provide clues about how dinosaurs interacted, as well as their size and the speeds at which they moved.",
    "story": [
      "British researchers have unearthed some 200 dinosaur footprints dating back 166 million years in a find believed to be biggest in the United Kingdom.",
      "Teams from Oxford and Birmingham Universities made the \"exhilarating\" discovery at a quarry in Oxfordshire in central England after a worker came across \"unusual bumps\" as he was stripping clay back with a mechanical digger, according to a new BBC documentary.",
      "\"This is one of the most impressive track sites I've ever seen, in terms of scale, in terms of the size of the tracks,\" said Prof Kirsty Edgar, a micropaleontologist from the University of Birmingham, told BBC News. \"You can step back in time and get an idea of what it would have been like, these massive creatures just roaming around, going about their own business.\"",
      "The site features five extensive trackways, with the longest continuous track stretching almost 500 feet in length.",
      "Four of the five trackways uncovered are believed to have been made by a long-necked herbivorous dinosaur, most likely a cetiosaurus.",
      "The fifth set of tracks likely belongs to a nine-meterlong carnivorous megalosaurus known for its distinctive three-toed feet with claws, according to the University of Birmingham.",
      "\"It's rare to find them so numerous in one place and it's rare to find such extensive trackways as well,\" Emma Nicholls of Oxford University's Museum of Natural History told AFP.",
      "The area could turn out to be one of the world's biggest dinosaur track sites, she added.",
      "The discovery will feature in the BBC television documentary \"Digging for Britain\", due to be broadcast on January 8.",
      "\"Exhilarating\" discovery",
      "A 100-strong team led by academics from Oxford and Birmingham excavated the tracks during a week-long dig in June.",
      "The new footprints follow a smaller discovery in the area in 1997, when 40 sets were uncovered during limestone quarrying, with some trackways reaching up to 180 meters in length.",
      "The researchers took 20,000 photographs of the latest footprints and created detailed 3D models of the site using aerial drone photography.",
      "It is hoped the discovery will provide clues about how dinosaurs interacted, as well as their size and the speeds at which they moved.",
      "\"Knowing that this one individual dinosaur walked across this surface and left exactly that print is so exhilarating,\" the Oxford museum's Duncan Murdock told the BBC. \"You can sort of imagine it making its way through, pulling its legs out of the mud as it was going.\"",
      "Richard Butler, a paleobiologist from the University of Birmingham, said some chance weather may be the reason the tracks had been so well preserved.",
      "\"We don't know exactly... but it might be that there was a storm event that came in, deposited a load of sediments on top of the footprints, and meant that they were preserved rather than just being washed away,\" he said.",
      "Quarry worker Gary Johnson, whose watchfulness triggered the excavation, said the experience had been spellbinding.",
      "\"I thought I'm the first person to see them. And it was so surreal -- a bit of a tingling moment, really,\" he told BBC News.",
      "The discovery was announced just a few months after a team of paleontologists found matching dinosaur footprints on what are now two different continents, separated by thousands of miles of ocean.",
      "Last year, engineers working to prevent flooding on a beach in the U.K. made a \"dramatic discovery\" of dinosaur footprints that experts believe could be from a mantellisaurus, a type of dinosaur that had just three toes on each foot and traveled on its hind legs.",

      "Many people assume that the behavior itself is the problem, Jaffe said \u2014 but there is almost always an underlying reason for those unhealthy or harmful choices.",
      "\"The behavior was actually a medicine of sorts for a problematic undercurrent.\"",
      "\"The reason you do it is that at some point earlier in your life, there was pain or struggle or emotional discomfort,\" he said.",

      "For Jaffe, when he was 14 or 15 years old, his \"hook\" was social anxiety.",

      "\"We start living our lives trying to escape the discomfort of the hooks,\" he said.",

      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "\"We try to stop ourselves from doing what we don't like,\" he noted. \"Especially around New Year\u2019s, people might say, \u2018I'm going to stop eating bad foods or I'm going to stop being lazy.\u2019\"",

      "\"We have to stop trying to just eliminate bad habits \u2014 it doesn't work,\" Jaffe said. \"We have to replace them with something else.\"",
      "For example, if someone wants to quit smoking, they might keep gum or sunflower seeds in their pocket, he said.",
      "\"You just have to keep going.\"",
      "Or, if someone is too focused on work, that might mean letting go of some tasks and delegating them to other people.",

      "\"The recent surge in violent crimes in our public transit system cannot continue \u2014 and we need to tackle this crisis head-on,\" she said. \"I directed the MTA to install security cameras in every single subway car, and now that the project is complete, these cameras are helping police solve crimes even faster.\"",
      "Hochul went on to emphasize that \"many of these horrific incidents have involved people with serious untreated mental illness,\" which she said is \"the result of a failure to get treatment to people who are living on the streets and are disconnected from our mental health care system.\"",
      "She blamed weak state laws and \"nearly half a century of disinvestment in mental health care and supportive housing,\" which she said \"directly contributed to the crisis we see on our streets and subways.\"",

      "1. Stick to official app stores:\u00a0Always download apps from trusted platforms like the App Store for iOS or the Google Play Store for Android. These stores have built-in security measures that help detect and remove fake or harmful apps. Avoid downloading apps from random websites or third-party stores, as they are more likely to host malicious software. Even on official stores, check the app\u2019s reviews, ratings and download count to ensure it\u2019s trustworthy.",
      "2. Pay attention to app permissions:\u00a0Be careful about the permissions you grant to apps during installation. A flashlight app, for example, doesn\u2019t need access to your contacts or location. Question any permission that doesn\u2019t align with the app\u2019s functionality. Both iOS and Android allow you to review and manage app permissions in your settings, so take the time to double-check what you\u2019ve already allowed.",

      "3. Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Implement\u00a02FA for your VPN accounts to add an extra layer of security beyond just a password.",
      "4. Keep software updated: Regularly update all VPN-related software, including clients, servers and associated networking hardware, to benefit from the latest security patches and improvements.",
      "5. Use strong encryption: Look for VPN services that use robust encryption protocols like AES-256 to protect your data.",
      "6. Monitor VPN traffic: Continuously monitor VPN traffic and logs for unusual patterns that might indicate security issues.",
      "7. Invest in strong antivirus software: A strong antivirus program can help detect and remove malware before it compromises your device. Many antivirus apps also come with features like web protection, anti-phishing tools and the ability to scan new apps for threats. While there are free options, premium versions often provide more comprehensive protection. Look for a trusted name in cybersecurity when choosing an antivirus solution.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Fake VPN apps are everywhere, and they\u2019re bad news. They\u2019re not just useless. They can turn your device into a tool for cybercriminals. The 911 S5 botnet showed us just how dangerous free VPNs can be, turning millions of devices into a giant network for fraud and attacks. The truth is free VPNs aren\u2019t really free. They often come with weak security, leak your data or demand permissions that put your privacy at risk. If you\u2019re serious about protecting your online activity, invest in a trusted, paid VPN service.",

    "published": "Sat, 04 Jan 2025 08:00:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Thieves who have iPhones can usually detect a hidden AirTag in vehicles they are attempting to steal, and an RFID wallet may not help you.",
    "story": [
      "You'll wonder how you functioned without an AirTag.",
      "Apple AirTags can be a great way to outsmart car thieves, but there are some drawbacks to consider. A key limitation is that thieves who also have iPhones can usually detect a hidden AirTag in vehicles they are trying to steal. This makes hiding an AirTag tricky.",
      "That\u2019s why we were intrigued by Brian\u2019s inquiry about using other ways to make Apple AirTags undetectable to car thieves or outsmarting them twice.",
      "\"If an AirTag is put in an RFID wallet and hidden in a car, can the AirTag be located by a thief using a locator? I know the AirTag will function in the wallet, but will it be undetectable by the thief?\" \u2014 Brian, LaSalle, Illinois",
      "Below are reasons why using an RFID wallet might end up leaving you outsmarted instead.",
      "I\u2019M GIVING AWAY THE LATEST AND GREATEST AIRPODS PRO 2",
      "Illustration of a car thief checking to see if the vehicle has an AirTag. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why RFID wallets might not outsmart car thieves?",
      "Some thieves use RFID readers, which use radio waves, to scan and read data such as credit cards in wallets. The function of RFID wallets and bags is to protect items or devices from these radio waves by blocking them.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Apple AirTags use different technology, so even if it was placed in an RFID-blocking wallet or bag, it could still be detected by a thief with an iPhone or locator. Unlike the radio waves used to scan for credit cards and other data, Apple AirTags use Bluetooth and Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology. Neither technology can be shielded by RFID-blocking material because those materials cannot block Bluetooth and UWB signals.",
      "A person holding an RFID wallet. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DO EMF BLOCKERS REALLY PROTECT US?",
      "What can block AirTag technology?",
      "Faraday bags, on the other hand, use electromagnetic shielding and can successfully block Apple AirTag signals, such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi signals, from being detected by thieves. The only issue with putting an Apple AirTag in a Faraday bag to hide in your car is that if the car thief cannot read or locate the signal it emits, you cannot either.",
      "While the\u00a0Apple AirTag may go undetected when in a Faraday bag, you will likely not be able to use FindMy or any other tracking methods to locate it either, because those methods require signals pinged from the AirTag to other iPhones and Apple Devices to track location.",

      "An RFID wallet. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Alternatives to AirTags for car security",
      "While\u00a0Apple AirTags offer some benefits, there are other technologies and methods to consider for enhancing car security. For example, GPS trackers provide real-time location data without the risk of being detected by a nearby iPhone. Additionally, physical deterrents like\u00a0steering wheel locks and alarm systems can act as effective safeguards. Combining multiple layers of security can better protect your vehicle against theft.\u00a0Check out how to prevent your car from being stolen.",
      "HOW TO OUTSMART CAR THIEVES WITH THESE SMART AIRTAG TACTICS",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "While\u00a0Apple AirTags can be a useful device to help you keep track of your vehicle, whether it is lost or stolen, it does not replace the reliability of a GPS system installed in your vehicle if you are trying to outsmart car thieves. Because car thieves might be able to locate an Apple AirTag hidden in your vehicle, it may not provide the layer of protection you hope for. Though the technology in RFID wallets will not block signals from an Apple AirTag, which will make them detectable to locators and scanners, Faraday bags will. Unfortunately, you will end up outsmarting yourself in trying to outsmart car thieves if you use a Faraday bag because you will then not be able to track the Apple AirTags either. If you are looking for the optimal way to outsmart car thieves, the Apple AirTags might not be the answer you are looking for.",

      "You know, it's pretty unsettling when you think about it. We spend our whole lives working hard and saving up for retirement. Then, one day, you find out that some company you've never heard of is selling your personal information to whoever wants to buy it. It's not just alarming. It could actually put your financial security at risk.",
      "These companies are data brokers that collect and sell people's personal information, often without us even knowing about it. And get this: Some of them might be trading info that could affect your retirement savings.",
      "Crazy, right? But don't worry, it's not all doom and gloom. There are things we can do to protect ourselves. I want to talk about how these data brokers operate and what steps you can take to keep your retirement plans safe.",

      "How data brokers are endangering your retirement security",
      "There\u2019s one major way in which data brokers are endangering your retirement security, and it\u2019s right there in the name: data brokers buy, sell, trade and otherwise spread your personal information far and wide. This endangers your retirement security in three distinct ways, each more dangerous than the last:",
      "They don\u2019t know anything about you, but they have a way to reach you. Even if a scammer knows only your phone number or email address, it\u2019s enough for them to reach out to you. If they don\u2019t know who you are or anything about you, they have to take the most \"one-size-fits-all\" approach they can manage. Their goal is to get you to respond to them or click a link that leads to a malicious website. Once they learn more about you, they can better tailor their next moves.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "They know what you\u2019re like but not who you are. Scammers can buy ready-made packages of personal information from data brokers. A set like this might include only the phone numbers of people over the age of 60, for example, while another might provide the addresses of elderly people who require live-in care and are experiencing cognitive decline. The potential for abuse is clear. They don\u2019t have to know your name to target a dangerously effective scam at you.",
      "In other words, something aimed right at you and very difficult to ignore. Scammers can also buy shockingly detailed information about you, from your full name to your health care and financial information. These scams are the most dangerous, with the attackers knowing enough about you to breeze past many of your defenses.",
      "Any of the above types of scams can end in what might be the ultimate fraud \u2013 identity theft \u2013 but these three are more likely to get there, and in fewer steps, than the others.",

Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

Always go to the source of the communication via official channels from a secure device to confirm what\u2019s happening. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Don\u2019t give out sensitive information: If a message or email can put you under enough pressure to do something you shouldn\u2019t (like follow a link to a phishing site), imagine what a phone call can do. Any request for personal information should raise red flags. If something seems off, hang up.",

      "4. Verify identities before handing over money or information: Always verify who you are dealing with before providing any personal details (name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, financial information, etc.) or money. If someone asks for this information or claims they need to send you money, follow this rule: \"Hang up, look up and call back.\" This applies to phone calls, texts and emails. Hang up or set the message aside, find the legitimate contact information for the organization in question and reach out through official channels (not social media) to confirm the request.",

      "At approximately 8:40 a.m. PT on Jan. 1, 2025, a Tesla Cybertruck pulled up to the valet area of the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. Within 15 to 20 seconds, the vehicle exploded, killing the driver and injuring seven bystanders. Investigators discovered that the Cybertruck was packed with firework mortars and camp fuel canisters.",
      "The FBI is investigating the incident as a potential act of terrorism. Tesla CEO Elon Musk claimed on social media that the explosion was caused by large fireworks or a bomb in the bed of the Cybertruck and was unrelated to the vehicle itself.",
      "The New Orleans attack",
      "In the early hours of New Year's Day, a pickup truck, later identified as a Ford F-150, rammed through police barricades on Bourbon Street in New Orleans' French Quarter. The driver, identified as 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar, an Army veteran from Texas, mowed down pedestrians over a three-block stretch while firing into the crowd.",
      "The attack resulted in at least 15 deaths and dozens of injuries. Jabbar was killed in a subsequent shootout with police. The FBI is treating this incident as an act of terrorism, noting that an Islamic State flag was found on the vehicle and improvised explosive devices were discovered inside.",

      "Both vehicles used in these incidents were rented through\u00a0Turo, a peer-to-peer car-sharing platform. This connection has raised significant questions about the company's security measures and screening processes.",
      "What is Turo?",
      "Turo is a peer-to-peer car-sharing platform that connects vehicle owners with people looking to rent cars. Often described as the \"Airbnb for cars,\" Turo allows individuals to list their personal vehicles for rent, providing an alternative to traditional car rental companies.",
      "Founded in 2010 as RelayRides and rebranded to Turo in 2015, the company has grown into an international vehicle-sharing marketplace with more than 14 million users worldwide. Turo is available in more than 16,000 cities across the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia and France.",

      "The regulatory landscape for peer-to-peer car-sharing platforms like Turo is in a state of flux, with at least 13 states having enacted laws specifically governing this industry, distinct from regulations applied to traditional car rental companies.",
      "Turo has been proactive in advocating for additional regulations in various states to establish clearer operational guidelines. A significant development occurred in 2022 when New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed SB 6715 into law, providing a comprehensive regulatory framework for peer-to-peer car-sharing operations in the state. This legislation aims to expand transportation options and create economic opportunities for New Yorkers while addressing safety and insurance concerns.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "These tragic events have highlighted potential vulnerabilities in the peer-to-peer car-sharing model. As investigations into these incidents continue, it's likely that there will be increased scrutiny of Turo's operations and security measures. The car-sharing industry may face calls for stricter regulations and enhanced screening processes. Turo and similar platforms might need to reevaluate and strengthen their security protocols to prevent such incidents in the future.",

This real-world trial is providing valuable insights into the effectiveness and practicality of the RT-G in actual law enforcement scenarios.",
      "However, despite its impressive capabilities, the RT-G is not without its limitations. Video footage shows that the robot can be somewhat unstable when making turns, and its pursuit capabilities may be easily thwarted by a flight of stairs. These challenges highlight the ongoing need for development and improvement in robotic law enforcement technology.",

      "Kathy S. recently reached out with a concern many of us can relate to: \"I have received calls from Beijing and Russia on my cellphone. I did not answer them. Can you tell me why this is happening? Is my phone at risk?\"",

      "The rise of international call scams",
      "International call scams have become increasingly common in recent years. One particularly prevalent scam is known as \"Wangiri,\" which originates from Japan and means \"one-ring-and-cut.\" These scammers typically let your phone ring once or twice before hanging up, hoping to pique your curiosity and prompt a callback.",
      "A woman receiving an international call on her cellphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HOW TO PROTECT YOUR IPHONE & IPAD FROM MALWARE",
      "Why are you receiving these international scam calls?",
      "There are several reasons why you might be receiving calls from unfamiliar international numbers.",
      "Wangiri scam: Scammers use automated systems to call thousands of numbers, disconnecting after one ring. If you call back, you may be connected to a premium rate number, incurring significant charges.",

      "Is your phone at risk?",
      "While receiving unexpected international calls doesn't necessarily put your phone at immediate risk, there are several potential dangers to be aware of.\u00a0The primary risk lies in potential financial losses if you engage with these scammers. If you call back, you may be connected to a premium rate service number owned by the fraudster. You could also be charged heavily for these calls, with the scammer aiming to keep you on the line to increase the billed amount.",
      "While less common with Wangiri scams, there's always a risk of personal information theft if you engage with unknown callers. Sharing sensitive data like bank account numbers or Social Security numbers could lead to identity theft.",
      "Answering or returning these calls may signal to scammers that your number is active, potentially leading to more scam calls in the future. Although not typically associated with Wangiri scams, some sophisticated phone scams can potentially install malware on your device if you click on certain links, prompts or follow instructions given by the scammer.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "While these international calls can be concerning, there are several steps you can take to safeguard yourself and your personal information. Here are six effective strategies to help protect against potential scams and unwanted calls.",
      "1) Don't answer or call back: If you receive a call from an unknown international number, resist the urge to answer or return the call.",
      "2) Block suspicious numbers: Use your phone's built-in features to\u00a0block these numbers and prevent future calls.",
      "3) Report the calls: Inform your phone carrier and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) about these suspicious calls.",
      "4) Use call-blocking apps: Consider installing\u00a0call-blocking apps to identify and block spam calls.",
      "5) Be cautious with personal information: Never share sensitive data over the phone, especially with unfamiliar callers.",
      "6) Invest in personal data removal services: Consider using services that remove your personal data from the internet, reducing the chances of scammers obtaining your information. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "1) Encrypting your internet connection: This makes it extremely difficult for hackers, ISPs or other third parties to intercept and read your data.",
      "2) Masking your IP address: By hiding your real IP address, a VPN allows you to browse the internet anonymously, making it harder for websites and advertisers to track your online activities.",

Using a\u00a0VPN service can enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Antivirus protects your device: It guards against threats that could compromise your device's security, regardless of how they reach your system. Therefore, it's important to have strong antivirus software actively running on your devices. Antivirus software helps protect your devices from malware, viruses and other security threats. Regularly update the software to ensure it can detect and remove the latest threats.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "In an email we received from Janet D., she shared her recent unsettling experience. Here\u2019s what she described:",
      "\"I received a pop-up that froze my computer and read, \u2018Access to this system is blocked for security reasons\u2019 from Windows Defender Security Center. It came with an audio message and siren.\"",
      "Janet did what many might do in such a panic-inducing situation: She called the number displayed on her screen. She was instructed to press Ctrl + Shift + Esc, unfreezing her computer, but the instructions didn\u2019t stop there. The scammer directed her to download software from UltraViewer.net, a legitimate remote access tool often exploited by bad actors. Here\u2019s what you should know if you ever encounter a similar scam.",

      "Windows Defender pop-up scam (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "3 red flags to recognize a tech support scam",
      "1) Unsolicited pop-ups claiming to be from Microsoft or other security services:\u00a0Janet\u2019s story highlights a common scam tactic, which is fake alerts masquerading as official warnings. Microsoft and other legitimate companies do not issue pop-ups with support numbers or direct you to download remote access software.",
      "2) Urgent audio and visual cues: Scammers create a sense of urgency with sirens, flashing messages and warnings of dire consequences to push victims into immediate action without thinking critically.",
      "3) Requests to install remote access software: Scammers often use tools like UltraViewer, TeamViewer or AnyDesk to gain access to victims\u2019 systems. While these tools are legitimate for remote tech support, downloading them at the request of an unknown party is a red flag.",

      "If you come across a scam, it's important to act quickly and take the following steps to protect yourself and your information.",
      "If you receive a suspicious pop-up, do not call the number provided or follow any on-screen instructions. Look up any suspicious phone numbers or messages independently. Use Ctrl + Alt + Del to open the Task Manager and close the browser or application displaying the message.",
      "Scammers thrive on urgency. Take a moment to assess the situation calmly. Janet asked if the scammers could have taken any information. Here\u2019s what to do.",
      "First, look for any unfamiliar software installed after the incident and uninstall it.Visit your email, banking and other important accounts to check for unauthorized sign-ins or transactions.Use strong antivirus software to conduct a comprehensive scan. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Enable two-factor authentication, as this adds a layer of security even if someone obtains your login credentials.",
      "If you suspect that your computer is still compromised, it might be best to consult with a professional to ensure your system is secure. You may want to reach out to\u00a0Microsoft Support for additional guidance and to report the incident to help prevent others from falling victim.",

      "YOUR EMAIL DIDN'T EXPIRE, IT'S JUST ANOTHER SNEAKY SCAM",
      "Why Janet didn\u2019t receive a warning from her antivirus software",
      "Janet also mentioned that her antivirus software didn\u2019t flag the scam. Unfortunately, many of these scams rely on social engineering rather than malware to bypass antivirus detection. They exploit human psychology, not just technical vulnerabilities. However, running regular scans can still help detect hidden threats.",

      "What do I do if I provided personal information to a scammer?",
      "First, don't be the slightest bit embarrassed, as it could have happened to genuinely anyone. And the worst thing you can do is stay silent. You can help prevent this from happening to others.",
      "Stop all communication: Cease all contact with the scammer immediately. Do not engage further or respond to any messages or calls from them.",
      "Report the scam: Report the incident to your local law enforcement agency or the cybercrime unit in your country. Provide them with all the information you have about the scammer and the communication you had with them.",
      "Notify your bank and credit card companies: If you shared any financial information, contact your bank and credit card companies right away. Inform them about the potential scam and ask for advice on how to secure your accounts.",
      "Monitor your accounts: Keep a close eye on your bank accounts, credit cards and other financial accounts for any suspicious activity. Report any unauthorized transactions immediately.",
      "Inform credit bureaus: Consider contacting credit reporting agencies to put a fraud alert on your credit report. This can help prevent the scammer from opening new accounts in your name.",
      "Be cautious about future communications: Be vigilant regarding any future communications from unknown sources. Scammers may try to target you again using different tactics.",
      "Use identity theft protection: If a scammer gets a hold of your personal information, you may consider a service that will walk you through every step of the reporting and recovery process. One of the best things you can do to protect yourself from this type of fraud is to subscribe to an identity theft service. One of the best parts of using an identity theft protection service is that it can include identity theft insurance of up to\u00a0$1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white-glove fraud resolution team where a U.S.-based case manager\u00a0helps you recover any losses.\u00a0Read more of my review of the best identity theft protection services here.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Janet\u2019s experience is a reminder that even the most vigilant among us can fall prey to clever scams designed to exploit fear and urgency. By recognizing red flags like unsolicited pop-ups, high-pressure tactics and requests for remote access, you can protect yourself and your personal information. If you ever encounter a situation like Janet\u2019s, remember to stay calm, verify the legitimacy of any alerts and take the necessary steps to secure your system. Scammers rely on quick reactions, so slow down, stay in control and don\u2019t let them manipulate your next move.",

The report says the death toll is \"an unprecedented figure in the past three decades,\" and represents an increase of 16% from the 864 executions conducted in 2023.",
      "Most of the regime\u2019s executions took place in the latter half of the year. Almost 70% occurred after the July election of President Masoud Pezeshkian. About 47% took place in the fourth quarter of 2024, when the regime \"faced severe defeats in the region and mounting economic and social crises,\" the NCRI said.",
      "Maryam Rajavi, the president-elect of the NCRI, said that the series of executions represent a \"desperate attempt to prevent the uprising of an angry populace who will settle for nothing less than the regime\u2019s complete overthrow. These medieval crimes, however, double the resolve of Iran\u2019s youth to topple the religious dictatorship.\"",

An August 2024 report from the United Nations-mandated Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Islamic Republic of Iran said that the Baluchis make up 2% of the Iranian population. The fact-finding mission also found that ethnic and religious minorities have been \"disproportionately impacted by the Government\u2019s response to the protests that began in September 2022,\" after Mahsa Amini, a Kurdish woman arrested for not wearing a headscarf, died in Iranian custody.",

      "By early August, Ukraine made international headlines when it launched a surprise ground incursion into Russia\u2019s Kursk region. It was an apparent attempt to divert forces from eastern Ukraine to the Kremlin\u2019s home turf and give it a bargaining chip when the time comes for peace negotiations.",
      "The campaign was the largest attack on Russia since World War II, and by mid-October the Pentagon had confirmed that North Korea had deployed troops to Russia, with some 11,000 North Korean soldiers believed to be fighting Ukraine in Kursk, the first foreign nation to send in troops since the war began.",
      "Though North Korea is not the only nation to aid Russia in its invasion, Iran has for years been sending Shahed drones. In September, the U.S. accused Iran of supplying Russia with short-range ballistic missiles.",

But North Korea is also reported to have endured heavy losses, with Zelenskyy claiming this week that 3,000 North Korean troops had been killed in the fighting while others face extreme logistical shortages, including access to clean water, the Associated Press reported.",

      "North Korea\u2019s deployment of troops to Russia reportedly prompted South Korea to consider escalating its non-lethal aid by mulling over a supply of missiles. Japan on Christmas Day sent Ukraine $3 billion in frozen Russian assets, adding to the $12 billion Tokyo has provided to Kyiv. In addition, Japan also pledged to support Ukraine\u2019s energy sector, which Russia routinely targets.",

    "story": [
      "Dietary supplements \u2014 vitamins, minerals, botanicals and probiotics \u2014 are more popular than ever.\u00a0More than three-quarters of Americans take at least one, according to the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Are any of them worth it? The research is mixed. Some vitamins, including multivitamins, have been shown to be beneficial in large, randomized clinical trials. Others have been shown to potentially cause harm. Many lie somewhere in between.",
      "As many as 100,000 different supplement products are sold in stores and online in the U.S., the FDA estimates. They range from multivitamins to herbs to concoctions that promise weight loss, including some that may be toxic or falsely claim to improve brain function.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick for health secretary, told podcaster Lex Fridman in 2023 that he takes \u201ca ton of vitamins and nutrients,\u201d which he said he couldn\u2019t list because he \u201ccouldn\u2019t remember them all.\u201d In an October post on X, Kennedy accused the FDA of \u201caggressive suppression\u201d of vitamins and nutraceuticals, among other things.",
      "In fact, the FDA has limited oversight over supplements after they\u2019re on the market. In a published study from 2018, researchers\u00a0with the California Department of Public Health raised concerns about products that contain unapproved and potentially unsafe ingredients.",
      "The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 put dietary supplements in the same category as food under the FDA. This framework means the agency regulates dietary supplements as food products rather than pharmaceuticals. As a result, overseeing the products\u2019 safety and efficacy is largely left up to the companies that sell them.",
      "\u201cThe FDA does not approve dietary supplements or their product labeling before they are sold to the public,\u201d Dr. Cara Welch, director of the FDA\u2019s Office of Dietary Supplement Programs in the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said in an interview on the agency\u2019s website. \u201cIn fact, most products can be lawfully brought to the market without FDA even knowing.\u201d",
      "If a company wants to sell a dietary supplement that contains an ingredient that is not already present in food sold in the U.S., the company must submit a \u201cnew dietary ingredient\u201d notification to the FDA including a \u201chistory of use or other evidence of safety establishing that the dietary ingredient, when used under the conditions recommended or suggested in the labeling of the dietary supplement, will reasonably be expected to be safe.\u201d",
      "The FDA reviews the notifications for safety issues but does not approve or reject the supplement based on the efficacy of the ingredient.",
      "\u201cOnly a tiny fraction of the dietary supplements on the market have been rigorously tested for efficacy or safety,\u201d said Dr. JoAnn Manson, chief of the division of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital.",
      "Companies can also use a loophole called generally recognized as safe, or GRAS. This designation allows substances deemed as safe according either to research or the fact that they are already used in food to be used in new products. No notification to the FDA is required.",
      "\u201cCompanies can just declare something as GRAS and then add it to supplements, and the FDA will never know about it unless there is a major problem,\u201d said Jensen Jose, regulatory counsel at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group.",
      "Limits to the research",
      "Many of the vitamins and minerals on the market are generally safe, if not always effective, and the agency does have the authority to request a recall if a product causes adverse side effects once consumers start using it or if the company is caught making misleading claims about a supplement. Some companies also voluntarily self-regulate.",
      "\u201cWhat we do in self-regulation is above and beyond what is required in federal regulation,\u201d said Steve Mister, president and CEO of the Council for Responsible Nutrition, a trade association and lobbying group that represents businesses that manufacture supplements. \u201cThere is a collective mindset that the industry needs to behave in responsible ways.\u201d",
      "When it comes to research, understanding the effects supplements have on human health is difficult, time-consuming and costly, said Dr. David Seres, director of medical nutrition at the Columbia University Medical Center\u2019s Institute of Human Nutrition.",
      "\u201cThe majority of the research that one hears about is observational, where two things are correlated but the cause and effect relationship cannot be established based on that research,\u201d Seres said. \u201cThe majority of nutrition research tends to be these kinds of studies.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are clearly supplements with established benefits,\u201d said Christopher Gardner, a professor of nutrition at Stanford University. \u201cThere are also many supplements that are likely not beneficial, but also not harmful.\u201d",
      "More doesn't mean better",
      "Manson, who led the COSMOS-Mind clinical trial on multivitamins, said people should be cautious about vitamins that contain \u201cmega doses.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou have to look at the level and see what it says in terms of percentage of daily intake. Often it will say 400% or 500%, well above the daily intake value,\u201d she said.",
      "Such high doses can be dangerous or a waste of money.",
      "The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independent panel of medical experts who make care recommendations regarding preventive and primary care, just drafted a new recommendation that advises against taking vitamin D to prevent falls and fractures among older people, based on evidence that shows it isn\u2019t beneficial \u2014 unless someone has a diagnosed deficiency.",
      "There is some evidence that a daily multivitamin can protect against memory loss; however, numerous studies have failed to show that supplements have any miraculous effects on health. A diet like the Mediterranean diet, which is full of plants, vegetables and fatty fish, can lower risks of dementia or heart disease, but supplements usually don\u2019t offer the same benefits, research has found.",
      "\u201cIn general, we should be able to get all the nutrients we need from foods, but the reality is many people do not always have access to a reasonable variety of healthy foods,\u201d Gardner said, adding that people who do not have access to a variety of nutritious foods may benefit from some supplements.",
      "For everyone else, more doesn\u2019t mean better.",
      "\u201cMost Americans meet all of their vitamin, mineral and nutritional needs. If intake is already adequate, it is rare when more would help,\u201d he added.",
      "There isn\u2019t one answer for why people take supplements that may be providing little to no benefit, but it may be due to a strong desire to control their health, said Seres.",
      "\u201cThe hint of a benefit is a strong temptation when it is assumed that it can\u2019t possibly be harmful and the airwaves are filled with \u2018supports XYZ health,\u2019\u201d he said."

      "The Summary",
      "Research over the last year has found that certain diet and exercise regimens may help reduce a person\u2019s \u201cbiological age.\u201dThose regimens include following a plant-based diet, getting daily physical activity and doing strength training.Biological age is a measure of physiological health, rather than one\u2019s number of birthdays.",

      "New Year\u2019s resolutions to eat healthier or exercise more may have an added benefit beyond physical fitness or weight loss: A spate of studies published over the last year suggest that certain diet and exercise regimens might help reduce a person\u2019s \u201cbiological age.\u201d",
      "The term refers to indicators of one\u2019s physiological health, rather than how many birthdays they\u2019ve had. Although the measurement can\u2019t predict how long an individual will live, the idea is to assess where someone\u2019s body is in the aging process based on factors like cell damage, organ function or cholesterol and blood pressure levels.",
      "Recent research offers additional evidence that certain habits already known to be healthy \u2014 like following a plant-based diet, staying active throughout the day and doing weekly strength training \u2014 could stave off some negative health effects associated with aging.",
      "However, biological aging is a complex process, and experts caution that stress, chronic illness, smoking and a person\u2019s genetics can all complicate the picture. Plus, they said, there are many reasons to get regular exercise and eat a nutrient-rich diet beyond turning back the biological clock.",
      "Nonetheless, here is what five studies published in the last year have found about the links between diet, exercise and aging.",
      "Eat more plants and less junk food",
      "Mounting evidence suggests that plant-based diets may help slow biological aging.",
      "A study published in October looked at the effects of a vegan diet on 22 pairs of identical twins. The researchers assigned one twin in each pair to a vegan meal plan, while the other ate an omnivorous diet that included meat, eggs and dairy, as well as plants.",
      "At the end of eight weeks, the researchers measured the twins\u2019 biological ages based on their telomeres \u2014 protective caps at the ends of chromosomes that shorten with age. Over time, that shortening can prevent cells from dividing, which increases the risk of disease or death. The study also measured changes in the participants\u2019 DNA methylation \u2014 a method used by cells to control gene expression \u2014 which are strongly correlated with aging.",
      "The results indicated that the twins who followed the vegan diet showed significant decreases in their biological age relative to the omnivorous group.",
      "Christopher Gardner, one of the study\u2019s authors, said the vegan diets contained more nutrient-rich foods like vegetables, beans and whole grains, as well as less saturated fat. But it\u2019s not clear which aspect of the diet slowed the aging process, he added, or how long the benefits might last.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean you can just do this for eight weeks and all of a sudden you\u2019re younger,\u201d said Gardner, a nutrition scientist at Stanford Medicine.",
      "Plus, not all vegan diets are equally healthy (french fries and soda are technically vegan, after all), so Gardner suggested a simple rule of thumb: Eat more plants and less junk food.",
      "Indeed, a July study found that a higher consumption of antioxidant-rich or anti-inflammatory foods, like vegetables, olive oil, whole grains and seafood, was associated with a younger biological age, whereas a greater sugar intake was associated with an older biological age.",
      "Another study pointed to the benefits of following a calorie-restricted, plant-based regimen just part of the time. Out of a group of 100 adult participants, researchers asked some to follow a strict diet for five consecutive days per month over three months, while eating as they normally would for the rest of the time. On diet days, calorie intake was limited to 700 to 1,100 daily calories, with all food pre-prepared and provided to the participants. The kits contained items like vegetable soup, nut bars and herbal tea. The other study participants simply continued their normal patterns for the full three months.",
      "The researchers assessed people\u2019s biological ages based on several measures of health, such as cholesterol and blood pressure. They found that the group that had incorporated a plant-based diet into their monthly routines had a biological age that was two-and-a-half years younger than when they started, regardless of whether they lost weight during the study period.",
      "\u201cEvery doctor in the United States, this should be part of their toolkit,\u201d said Valter Longo, director of the USC Longevity Institute and one of the study\u2019s authors.",
      "Longo said his research suggests that the special five-day diet he studied may help generate new, healthy cells and reduce insulin resistance, which can in turn lower blood sugar. Such a regimen is likely to make the biggest difference for people who have diabetes, obesity or are overweight, he added.",
      "Daily walks and weekly strength training",
      "Although exercise has long been known to improve brain health, a study published in October found that even a small amount of physical activity could lower one's \u201ccognitive age\u201d \u2014 how young a person are based on their mental acuity.",
      "The study enrolled more than 200 middle-aged New Yorkers, who were prompted several times per day by a smartphone app to record their physical activity within the last three-and-a-half hours. Immediately after, they were instructed to play \u201cbrain games\u201d that measured their cognitive function, such as matching tiles with various symbols. The participants\u2019 speed at solving the games was used as a measure of their brain age.",
      "\u201cWe generally get slower as we age cognitively,\u201d said Jonathan Hakun, the study\u2019s author and a neurology professor at Penn State University. \u201cSomewhere in middle age \u2014 it\u2019s thought to be somewhere around the sixth or seventh decade \u2014 we start to see slightly more rapid change in our ability to solve these problems quickly.\u201d",
      "The study found that people who had recently engaged in physical activity displayed a mental speed associated with a brain age four years younger than they displayed after periods of inactivity. The activity could have been as simple as walking the dog, doing chores or playing with kids.",
      "Hakun said the findings could result from physical activity arousing the central nervous system.",
      "\u201cThe physical activity that we would get in our everyday lives might just put us in a state to be more prepared or ready to respond to a puzzle or problem if it comes up,\u201d he said.",
      "Research this year also found links between a particular type of exercise and a reduction in biological age. A study published in October found that doing 90 minutes of strength training each week \u2014 exercises like using weights or resistance to strengthen muscles \u2014 was associated with a nearly four-year reduction in biological age.",
      "The findings were based on 4,800 responses to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, an ongoing study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Adults who said they engaged in strength training regularly were found to have significantly longer telomeres than adults who did not, suggesting a lower biological age.",
      "Hakun emphasized, though, that the benefits of exercise extend far beyond the cognitive, since regular physical activity is also known to reduce blood sugar and risk factors for heart disease, among many other positive effects.",
      "\u201cPeople have been regarding physical activity as a large keystone behavior for all dimensions of health,\u201d he said. \u201cI have very rarely come across, if ever, a project that says that physical activity has a negative impact.\u201d"

    "published": "Thu, 02 Jan 2025 22:22:12 GMT",
    "summary": "A new test can differentiate between various types of asthma via a nasal swab. Researchers hope it can eventually help match patients with better treatments.",

      "The Summary",
      "A new paper describes a test that can differentiate between different types of asthma via a nasal swab.Researchers hope the test can eventually be used to help match patients with better treatments.The research focused on Black and Puerto Rican children, who have higher rates of asthma and asthma-related deaths than white children.",
      "A new paper describes a test that can differentiate between different types of asthma via a nasal swab.",
      "Researchers hope the test can eventually be used to help match patients with better treatments.",
      "The research focused on Black and Puerto Rican children, who have higher rates of asthma and asthma-related deaths than white children.",
      "For many children diagnosed with asthma, pinpointing the particular nature of their case and finding appropriate treatment is far from simple.The lung disease, which affects more than 4.6 million children in the U.S., is often broken down into two categories. The first, known as \u201cT2-high\u201d asthma, is caused by inflammation from a particular type of immune system cell called T helper 2. Until recent years, it was assumed to be the most common form.",
      "The second category, \u201cT2-low\u201d asthma, is essentially a catchall for other forms. It encompasses two subtypes \u2014 one involving less inflammation, and another characterized by inflammation from a different kind of T cell.",
      "In some moderate or severe cases, figuring out which type of asthma a child has can help doctors match patients with proper treatment. But testing options have long been limited: Typically, doctors either draw blood to measure levels of immune cells or antibodies, or have children breathe into a mouthpiece to measure the nitric oxide in their breath.",
      "However, the tests aren\u2019t always accurate, and they only detect T2-high asthma, and thus can\u2019t differentiate between other subtypes.",
      "So researchers at the University of Pittsburgh developed a more precise way to diagnose different asthma subtypes: collecting nasal swabs, then sequencing the RNA they contain. In people with two of the asthma subtypes, certain genes associated with inflammation are more highly expressed, so the researchers looked for those hallmarks. The third subtype was identified through the absence of those genetic hallmarks.",
      "They describe the novel test in a paper published Thursday in the journal JAMA. The researchers used the test on more than 450 children and teens across three studies: one in Puerto Rico, one in Pittsburgh and one in both locations. The study participants were predominantly Puerto Rican or non-Hispanic Black.",
      "The analysis showed that the nasal swabs could accurately diagnose several asthma subtypes. It also found that \u201cT2-low\u201d asthma \u2014 which has been associated with air pollution \u2014 was most common among the participants.",
      "Black and Puerto Rican children have higher rates of asthma and asthma-related deaths than white children in the U.S. and are more likely to be exposed to asthma triggers like air pollution, dust or mold.",
      "The research builds on previous studies that have similarly detected asthma via nasal swabs.",
      "The researchers hope the test can improve the process of matching kids to appropriate asthma treatments, said Dr. Juan Celed\u00f3n, one of the paper\u2019s authors and chief of pulmonary medicine at UPMC Children\u2019s Hospital of Pittsburgh.",
      "\u201cTo me, this is a necessary first step for better personalized medicine,\u201d he said.",
      "The default treatment for any type of asthma is steroids, usually delivered through an inhaler. But in moderate or severe cases, that might not be enough. In the last decade, the Food and Drug Administration has approved several injectable or intravenous drugs for such patients. These counteract molecules that trigger inflammation in the airways, but they are largely geared toward T2-high asthma.",
      "Celed\u00f3n said the nasal swab test could help researchers identify people with T2-low asthma for the purpose of enrolling them in studies that test new treatments for that target.",
      "\u201cInstead of treating most people the same, in a few years, we can treat you better according to the type of asthma you have,\u201d he said.",
      "The new findings are also noteworthy because the research involved children of color, who are often underrepresented in asthma studies, said Dr. Gurjit Hershey, director of the asthma research division at Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital, who was not involved in the new paper.",
      "\u201cMany studies have been done traditionally in white, European populations. \u2026 To be able to have a study that really focuses on Puerto Rican and Black children is important,\u201d she said.",
      "However, the technology isn\u2019t ready to go mainstream. Celed\u00f3n said it would need FDA approval before doctors could use it.",
      "Plus, Hershey said, more research is needed to determine if a child\u2019s asthma type is consistent throughout their youth, or if it changes in response to environmental exposures such as pollution or allergens.",
      "\u201cThe place to be cautious is, does it make sense to treat based on this?\u201d she said, referring to the nasal swab test results. \u201cWe would have to do a study to figure that out.\u201d",
      "Dr. Jessica Hui, a pediatric allergist at National Jewish Health, a respiratory hospital in Denver, also cautioned that genetic sequencing is expensive, and the results would need to be analyzed by someone proficient in studying RNA.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very specialized type of analysis,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like this is something we can implement immediately, but for sure it\u2019s an exciting direction.\u201d"

      "It has long been a source of shame as much as curiosity.",
      "Now, some 80 years later, the names of those suspected of collaborating with the Nazis have been made public in the Netherlands as the country goes to new lengths to document the extent of its complicity in the horrors perpetrated by the Third Reich.",
      "In the country where teenage diarist Anne Frank is the most famous victim of the Holocaust, a historical research group funded by the Dutch government has for the first time published a list of nearly half a million people suspected of collaboration during World War II, after a law prohibiting its release expired on New Year\u2019s Day.",
      "The Huygens Institute\u2019s \u201cWar in Court\u201d project, which received an $18.5 million (18 million euros) grant from the three Dutch ministries that govern education, health and justice, has made public a digital archive that includes a list of 425,000 mostly Dutch people who were investigated for collaborating with the Netherlands\u2019 Nazi occupiers.",
      "The archive is \u201can extraordinary resource, and one that is very timely in terms of the Dutch debates about World War II and levels of collaboration,\u201d said Dan Stone, a professor of modern history at Royal Holloway, University of London.",
      "\u201cAt the very least, it shows that huge numbers of people were accused of collaborating with the Nazi occupier,\u201d Stone told NBC News by email. \u201cAnd the fact that relatively few were imprisoned probably tells us as much about postwar Dutch society as it does about the wartime facts.\u201d",
      "Of those in the database, only a fifth ever appeared in court, with most cases concerning more minor offenses such as membership in the Nazi party, Reuters reported. According to the Dutch central statistics bureau, in 1939 \u2014 the year World War II broke out \u2014 the country\u2019s population was 8.7 million. That would make just under 5% of the country suspected collaborators.",
      "Germany invaded the Netherlands in 1940 and occupied the country until the allied liberation in 1945.",
      "During that period, more than 100,000 Dutch Jews \u2014 around three-quarters of those in the country \u2014 were killed in the Holocaust, with approximately 6 million Jews murdered overall alongside the Nazis\u2019 political opponents and members of other groups declared to be inferior, such as Roma and LGBTQ people."

      "The attacker, 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a U.S. Army veteran from Texas, drove a rented truck into a crowd of revelers on Bourbon Street in the early hours of New Year\u2019s Day. Authorities said he posted videos online during his journey to New Orleans in which he professed his support for ISIS. After plowing through the crowd, Jabbar was killed in a shootout with police.",

      "\u201cNo one knows what happened,\u201d\u00a0Faith\u00a0told Dateline. \u201cIt was just rumors on Facebook groups. But he was a person. He was my favorite person.\u201d",
      "Faith was 11 years old when her father\u2019s body was found hanging inside his exotic pet shop off Ironbridge Road in Chesterfield, Virginia, on January 3, 2014. \u201c[My family] just said that he died. I didn\u2019t know for a long time what happened,\u201d she\u00a0said. \u201cThere\u00a0was one moment where my mom had mentioned briefly that alluded to the fact that there was something else going on. But \u2014 but, like, no details, nothing.\u201d",
      "Of all the questions Faith has about her father\u2019s death, one is most elusive \u2014 did Vinny Ferraiolo die by suicide, or was he murdered?",
      "Now 22, Faith is determined to find the truth.",
      "Faith has vibrant, poignant memories of her father. \u201cHe loved Superman. And he\u2019d dress up for school and, like, just \u2014 I don\u2019t think it was for anything,\u201d she told Dateline. \u201cJust like a random Tuesday or something, and he just, like, would go to school, like, decked out in like his Superman stuff \u2014 his cape and everything.\u201d",
      "Vinny was a science teacher at Thomas Dale High School in Chesterfield.",
      "\u201cAll his students have always just, like, adored him so much,\u201d Faith\u00a0remembered. \u201cHe would do anything to make people laugh.\u201d",
      "Faith told Dateline she makes a conscious effort to embody her father\u2019s spirit. \u201cHe just made everything so magical, and he made you see the world in that kind of whimsical way,\u201d she said. \u201cIt reminds me to, like, stop taking life so seriously.\u201d",
      "Vinny was also the owner of an exotic animal pet shop. One of his employees was a high school student named Tripp Ford, who said that, despite having four sons of his own, Vinny made Tripp feel like another\u00a0son. \u201cHe was nothing short of a hero,\u201d Tripp\u00a0told Dateline.",
      "He described Vinny as one of the most beloved members of\u00a0the Chesterfield community \u2014 a \u201clocal celebrity.\u201d \u201cHe was the best human being I have ever met in my entire life,\u201d\u00a0Tripp said. \u201cHe always only ever inspired me and pushed me to do great things.\u201d",
      "11 years after his death, Tripp continues to be inspired by Vinny. And he \u2014 just like Faith \u2014 is demanding answers about his death.",
      "On the night of January 2, 2014, Vinny asked Faith if she wanted to come to the pet store with him the next day. \u201cI think I just, like, wanted to sleep in,\u201d Faith remembered.",
      "She\u00a0did not go to the store with her father the next morning.",
      "Vinny was scheduled to have a reptile show that day at the store around 10 a.m.\u00a0According to Faith, her\u00a0father would show up to work sometime before 8 a.m. whenever he had a show, and would park in the parking lot out front because it was easier to move materials in and out of the store from\u00a0there. Once done, he would move his car back where he usually parked.",
      "Around 12:30 p.m., a nearby store owner noticed that Vinny\u2019s car was still parked in the parking lot rather than around back, so they went to check on him.",
      "According to Chesterfield Police Department Criminal Investigations Division Captain Randy Horowitz, the store owner found Vinny\u2019s body with a rope around his neck hanging from the ceiling inside the shop. \u201cThe call came in at 12:30 from one of the other store owners noting that they had found him,\u201d Capt. Horowitz told Dateline.",
      "Tripp was scheduled to work\u00a0at the store that day. \u201cI was supposed to meet him at about eight o\u2019clock that morning. I didn\u2019t wake up till about 11,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that he didn\u2019t call me that morning to wake me up and to let me know to meet him was also strange.\u201d\u00a0Faith told Dateline she later learned that her father had canceled the show that morning.",
      "Tripp headed to the store shortly after waking up. \u201cI ran up there and then that\u2019s when I saw the first police car pulling up,\u201d he said.",
      "According to Captain Horowitz, Vinny was pronounced dead at 12:51 p.m.",
      "Faith was at home with her siblings when it all happened. She remembers her mother coming inside the house later that evening followed by several family members. As everyone gathered inside the living room and her mother approached her, Faith began to feel uneasy.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s always a moment where you realize something\u2019s not quite right. It was that moment,\u201d Faith recalled. \u201cShe just knelt down in front of me --\u00a0and you can tell she\u2019d been crying -- and she just \u2014 all she said was, \u2018Daddy died.\u2019\u201d",
      "Faith says she did not learn any details about her father\u2019s death in the months after his body was found. She remembers that time as being a blur, the only solid memory being a sense of helplessness. \u201cThere were no answers. There was no closure,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was nothing. Just a question.\u201d",
      "What happened to Vinny Ferraiolo?",
      "About six months after Vinny\u2019s death, the Office of the Medical Examiner of Virginia declared it a homicide.\u00a0The Chesterfield Police Department, however, did not agree with that assessment.",
      "\u201cThe Medical Examiner was concerned because there were two sets of marks on the neck,\u201d Captain Horowitz explained. The injuries Vinny sustained on his neck were uneven across either side \u2014 something the captain says is generally uncommon for people who die by hanging.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not the most common break \u2014 to have that break \u2014 but we\u2019re not talking,\u00a0like, one-in-a-million,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s our belief that he attempted to commit suicide and the rope did not hold,\u00a0and then he was more successful on the second trial.\u201d",
      "Dateline requested a copy of the medical examiner\u2019s report from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of Virginia. In an email to Dateline, Central District Administrator LaKeshia Johnson said the office was unable to provide the full report. However, she was able to confirm Vinny\u2019s manner and cause of death. \u201cThe manner of death is homicide and the cause of death is ligature strangulation,\u201d Johnson wrote in the email. \u201cUnfortunately, we will not be able to discuss anything additional.\u201d",
      "Tripp Ford believes Vinny\u2019s death was a homicide. He told Dateline that when he arrived at the shop that morning at about the same time as the police, the fish tanks had been moved, blocking both the front door and Vinny\u2019s body from view. \u201cEverything was thrown all over the place,\u201d he said. \u201cHe did not do that himself.\u201d",
      "Tripp says he still vividly remembers the way the store looked when he went inside. \u201cThere was blood everywhere \u2014 in the back office, on the register, on the walls, everywhere up to where his body was hanging,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to clean it myself.\u201d",
      "During his interview with Dateline, Capt. Horowitz addressed Tripp\u2019s recollection of the scene, noting that the door was not barricaded when police arrived. \u201c[Tripp] recalled\u00a0puddles of blood, and blood spurting onto the walls, and splattered on the walls,\u201d Horowitz\u00a0said. \u201cThere was a small amount of blood \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t on the walls, and it wasn\u2019t puddling.\u201d",
      "The captain confirmed that Vinny had wounds on his hands. He also had \u201ca knot on the back of his head and some blood on the ladder he appeared to have used.\u201d\u00a0According to Horowitz, the ladder was partially knocked over. \u201cThere was blood on his hands, pants and face, but no evidence of a laceration,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no question that he fell\u00a0at one point,\u201d Horowitz said of the injury to Vinny\u2019s head. \u201cAs far as the wounds on his hands, speaking to people who worked with him \u2014 or worked at the store and knew him from the store \u2014 said it was not unusual for him to have lots of cuts and bruises on his hands from the way he handled animals. But all those injuries were consistent with the idea that he attempted to commit suicide by hanging and the rope did not hold \u2014 and then he made a second attempt, which was successful.\u201d",
      "According to Captain Horowitz, Vinny\u2019s case was closed as a suicide\u00a0in August of 2014, despite the medical examiner\u2019s assessment. \u201cThis occurred after the department received a report from the DFS [Department of Forensic Science] Lab and after consultation with the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney Office,\u201d he wrote in a follow-up email to Dateline.",
      "During the original investigation, the Chesterfield Police Department used DNA testing technology on a piece of paper with red stains, a swab of a\u00a0red stain from the microwave, and a piece of paper towel with red stains from the top of a sink. \u201cThe lab report indicated that all items tested returned found no foreign DNA and only the DNA of Mr. Ferraiolo,\u201d Captain Horowitz wrote.",
      "In September 2019, Vinny\u2019s case was assigned to a detective in the Unsolved Major Investigations Group of the Chesterfield Police Department for additional review. \u201cAfter review, a few more items were sent to the DFS for additional testing and they also returned found no foreign DNA and only the DNA of Mr. Ferraiolo,\u201d Captain Horowitz wrote in an email to Dateline. \u201cThe case remained closed after the lab results showed no new leads.\u201d",
      "After that detective retired, the investigation was reassigned to another officer within the same group in June 2022. \u201cThis detective re-interviewed multiple witnesses and had the computer of Mr. Ferraiolo inspected,\u201d Captain Horowitz wrote. \u201cThis examination revealed numerous Google searches indicative of a person experiencing mental health issues.\u201d",
      "According to Captain Horowitz, the Chesterfield Police Department met with the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of Virginia on June 17, 2024, to discuss the case again. \u201cEssentially, they were not interested in hearing anything different,\u201d he said. \u201cWe presented them with our information, they have their thoughts, and we walked away agreeing to disagree.\u201d",
      "Vinny\u2019s daughter, Faith, also disagrees.",
      "\u201cWhy the two ligature marks? Why was [the neck broken unevenly]? Why was there a bloody tissue on the ground? Why was he still parked out front?\u201d she\u00a0questioned. \u201cWhy was there no note then? Why would he invite me to go to the store with him that day? Why? It\u2019s like \u2014 so much of it did not make sense.\u201d",
      "More than a decade after walking into the pet shop that day, Tripp Ford asks himself those same questions \u2014 and comes to the same conclusion. \u201cThere\u2019s just no way he just up and decided to do that and to leave his body there for us to discover,\u201d he told Dateline. \u201cThat is not something he would have ever done.\u201d",

      "Captain Horowitz responded to that allegation. \u201cHe was a very popular teacher. People cared about him and, from what I can tell, he cared about a lot of people.

      "Ukraine launched a surprise new offensive in Russia\u2019s Kursk region on Sunday, aiming to strike back after months under pressure ahead of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration.",
      "The assault appeared to be an effort to seize new territory in the area, where Kyiv\u2019s forces first swept across the border with a stunning incursion last August. Since then, the Kremlin has retaken a chunk of its own land but struggled to fully expel the invading troops, even deploying thousands of North Korean soldiers in recent weeks.",
      "Reports of the new offensive first emerged from the accounts of Russia\u2019s influential military bloggers early Sunday, before officials in Kyiv and then Moscow\u2019s defense ministry confirmed Ukrainian forces had launched a new attack.",
      "NBC News could not independently verify the claims, and it was not immediately clear how significant the assault was.",
      "\u201cThe Defense Forces are actively working,\u201d Andriy Kovalenko, head of Ukraine\u2019s Center for Countering Disinformation, said on Telegram. \u201cThe situation in the Kursk region seems to be causing significant concern among the Russians, as they were unexpectedly attacked on several fronts.\u201d",
      "Andriy Yermak, head of Ukraine\u2019s Presidential Office, also remarked, \u201cKursk region, good news: Russia is getting what it deserves.\u201d",

      "The offensive follows months of setbacks for Ukraine.",
      "Since the surprise incursion into Russia in August, the U.S. ally\u2019s military has been beset by low morale and manpower amid a barrage of Russian attacks.",
      "While Kyiv\u2019s forces have largely resisted Russian attempts to expel them from Kursk,\u00a0they\u00a0have lost more than 40% of the 380 square miles of Kursk that they seized in August, according to The Associated Press.",
      "And\u00a0they have since been on the defensive as the Kremlin\u2019s military pushes to retake more territory there and seize new land by advancing across the war\u2019s eastern front lines.",
      "The Ukrainian military said Saturday that the \u201chottest\u201d front was near Pokrovsk, an important road and rail hub Russia has been pressing toward for months."

    "story": [
      "Hundreds of South Koreans, bundled up against freezing temperatures and snow, rallied overnight into Sunday near the residence of impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol, calling for his ouster and arrest, as authorities prepared to renew their efforts to detain him over his short-lived martial law decree.",
      "Dozens of anti-corruption agency investigators and police attempted to execute a detainment warrant against Yoon on Friday but\u00a0retreated from his residence in Seoul after a tense standoff with the presidential security service\u00a0that lasted more than five hours.",
      "The one-week warrant for his detention is valid through Monday.",
      "There were no immediate indications that anti-corruption authorities were ready to send investigators back to the residence as of Sunday afternoon. Staff from the presidential security service were seen installing barbed wire near the gate and along the hills leading up to Yoon\u2019s residence over the weekend, possibly in preparation for another detention attempt.",
      "Last Tuesday, a Seoul court issued\u00a0a warrant to detain Yoon and a separate warrant to search his residence\u00a0after the embattled president defied authorities by\u00a0refusing to appear for questioning\u00a0and obstructing searches of his office. But enforcing them is complicated as long as Yoon remains in his official residence.",
      "Investigators from the country\u2019s anti-corruption agency are weighing charges of rebellion after the conservative president, apparently frustrated that his policies were blocked by a legislature dominated by the liberal opposition,\u00a0declared martial law\u00a0on Dec. 3 and\u00a0dispatched troops to surround the National Assembly.",
      "The Assembly overturned the declaration within hours in a unanimous vote\u00a0and impeached Yoon on Dec. 14, accusing him of rebellion, while South Korean anti-corruption authorities and public prosecutors opened separate investigations into the events.",
      "If the anti-corruption agency manages to detain Yoon, it will likely ask a court for permission to make a formal arrest. Otherwise, Yoon will be released after 48 hours.",
      "The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, which is leading a joint investigation with police and military investigators, says detaining Yoon would be \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d as long as he is protected by the presidential security service.",
      "The agency has urged the country\u2019s acting leader, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, to instruct the service to comply with their execution of the detainment warrant, but Choi has yet to publicly comment on the issue.",
      "In a video statement, Park Jong-joon, chief of the presidential security service, hit back against criticism that his organization has become Yoon\u2019s private army, saying it has legal obligations to protect the incumbent president. Park said he instructed his members not to use violence during their standoff with investigators and called for the anti-corruption agency and police to change their approach.",
      "Park and the deputy chief of the presidential security service defied summonses on Saturday from police, who planned to question them over the suspected obstruction of official duty following Friday\u2019s events.",
      "Yoon\u2019s legal team said it will file complaints against the anti-corruption agency\u2019s chief prosecutor, Oh Dong-woon, and approximately 150 investigators and police officers involved in Friday\u2019s detention attempt, which they claim was unlawful. The team said it will also file complaints with public prosecutors against the country\u2019s acting defense minister and police chief for ignoring the presidential security service\u2019s request to provide additional forces to block the detention attempt.",
      "Yoon\u2019s lawyers had submitted an objection to the warrants against the president on Thursday, but the Seoul Western District Court dismissed the challenge on Sunday.",
      "Park Chan-dae, floor leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, called for the anti-corruption agency to move quickly to detain Yoon, saying it was deeply disappointing to see the agency \u201chesitating and letting time slip away.\u201d",
      "Hundreds of anti-Yoon protesters rallied for hours near the gates of the presidential residence from Saturday evening to Sunday, voicing frustration over the failed detention attempt and demanding stronger efforts to bring Yoon into custody.",
      "Separated by police barricades and buses, pro-Yoon protesters were gathering in nearby streets, denouncing his impeachment and vowing to block any efforts to detain him."

    "story": [
      "The leadership of\u00a0Austria\u2019s ruling conservatives held a crisis meeting on Sunday to pick a successor to Chancellor Karl Nehammer, who announced his resignation on Saturday as attempts to form a coalition government without the far right\u00a0fell apart.",
      "More than two hours after the meeting began, several\u00a0Austrian media reported that People\u2019s Party (OVP) Secretary-General Christian Stocker, 64, would take over as party leader in an interim capacity. There was no immediate comment from the party.",
      "The\u00a0surprise collapse\u00a0of three and then two-party talks aimed at cobbling together a centrist coalition that could serve as a bulwark against the far-right\u00a0Freedom Party\u00a0(FPO) after the FPO came first in September\u2019s\u00a0parliamentary election\u00a0leaves President\u00a0Alexander Van der Bellen\u00a0with few options.",
      "A snap election with support for the euroskeptic, Russia-friendly FPO still growing or an\u00a0about-face\u00a0in which Van der Bellen tasks FPO leader Herbert Kickl with forming a government are now the most likely options, with only limited scope for alternatives or playing for time.",
      "\u201cIt is not an easy situation,\u201d Markus Wallner, the governor of Vorarlberg, the westernmost of\u00a0Austria\u2019s nine provinces, told reporters before the OVP leadership meeting at the chancellor\u2019s office.",
      "\u201cI believe we must do everything we can now to avoid sliding towards a national crisis.\u201d",
      "Wallner said he opposed a snap election since that would delay the arrival of a new government by months. OVP governors are part of the leadership.",
      "Nehammer insisted during and after the election campaign that his party would not govern with Kickl because he was too much of a conspiracy theorist and posed a security risk while at the same time saying much of Kickl\u2019s party was trustworthy.",
      "Nehammer\u2019s departure makes it likely that whoever succeeds him will be more open to a coalition with the FPO, which is formally allied with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban\u2019s Fidesz party.",
      "The FPO won September\u2019s election with around 29% of the vote, and opinion polls suggest its support has only grown since then, extending its lead over the OVP and Social Democrats to more than 10 percentage points while their support has shrunk.",
      "The OVP and FPO overlap on various issues, particularly taking a tough line on immigration, to the point that the FPO has accused the OVP of stealing its ideas.",
      "The two governed together from late 2017 until 2019, when a video-sting scandal involving the then-leader of the FPO prompted their coalition\u2019s collapse. At the state level, they govern together in five of nine states, including in OVP moderate Wallner\u2019s Vorarlberg.",
      "The national dynamic is now different because if they were to form an alliance the OVP would for the first time be junior partner to the FPO, making the position of OVP leader difficult and undesirable to many.",
      "After initial media reports that household names like former party leader Sebastian Kurz, who led the last coalition with the FPO and has since been\u00a0convicted of perjury, could become OVP leader,\u00a0Austrian media reported overnight that they were no longer in the running.",
      "That left lesser-known figures such as new Chamber of Commerce Secretary-General Wolfgang Hattmannsdorfer, 45.",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Back in his first term, Donald Trump was talking to a senior White House aide, Steve Bannon, about potential films to show in the building\u2019s movie theater.",
      "Bannon suggested Ken Burns\u2019 classic documentary on the Civil War, thinking it would be instructive to see how an earlier president, Abraham Lincoln, struggled to find capable generals.",
      "At that, Trump mentioned how once he had been flipping through the channels at his home in Bedminster, New Jersey, saw that the nine-part series was airing, and watched the whole thing, Bannon recounted in an interview.",
      "Forget Joe Biden and Barack Obama; it\u2019s the 16th president who seems to be a Trump fixation.",
      "He muses about Abe Lincoln\u2019s stovepipe hat, presidential bearing and even the mundane details of his daily existence. One of Trump\u2019s curiosities is how the 6-foot-4-inch Lincoln fit into his 19th-century White House bed.",
      "Then there\u2019s Lincoln\u2019s lofty place in history. Maybe too lofty for Trump\u2019s taste.",
      "Yes, Lincoln was \u201cprobably a great president,\u201d Trump said on Fox News in the final weeks of the 2024 campaign. Quick came the side-eye: \u201cAlthough, I\u2019ve always said, why wasn\u2019t that settled? I\u2019m a guy that \u2014 it doesn\u2019t make sense we had a civil war.\u201d",
      "One Trump adviser recalls a phone call with Trump in which they spent 15 minutes discussing whether Lincoln could have forged a peaceful end to the conflict between the North and South. What stood out, the adviser said, was the amount of time Trump spent on the topic: \u201cThat\u2019s the longest conversation I ever had with him.\u201d",
      "Elected officials like to invoke Lincoln, finding fresh ways to pay homage. Biden\u2019s inaugural address in 2021 borrowed two of Lincoln\u2019s phrases: \u201cMy whole soul is in it,\u201d and \u201cThe last full measure of devotion.\u201d",
      "As a freshman senator from Illinois, Lincoln\u2019s home state, Obama wrote an essay inspired by a portrait of an aging Lincoln that hung in his office.",
      "\u201cWhat is it about this man that can move us so profoundly?\u201d the future president wondered.",
      "Trump, too, seems fascinated with Honest Abe. Why, exactly, isn't  easy to fathom. One was an up-from-nothing frontier lawyer who ended slavery and kept the nation from splitting in two while delivering some of the most lyrical presidential speeches in the canon.",
      "The other is the scion of a wealthy New York real estate developer, and a TV-star-turned-politician whose self-branded contribution to presidential discourse is \u201cthe weave.\u201d",
      "What we do know is Trump has a particular interest in outliers. His transition sidekick is Elon Musk, the wealthiest person in the world. He likes winners, and in what he calls the \"very exclusive club\" of American presidents, no one is more venerated than Lincoln.",
      "When scholars ranked the nation\u2019s presidents according to \u201cgreatness\u201d in a report released earlier this year, Lincoln finished first. Trump was last, leaving him some work to do to catch up.",
      "Still, Trump may feel a certain kinship with Lincoln, having faced assassination attempts in his second presidential campaign and, like Lincoln, having pulled off an upset in his first.",
      "Trump \"gives everything to the office in his estimation, and that\u2019s what Lincoln did,\u201d said Brandon Rottinghaus, a University of Houston political science professor and co-director of the project that ranks the presidents. \u201cSo, the parallels are interesting, perhaps not perfect. Both men governed over a very divided nation and attempted to bring their life experience to solve the problem.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s habit is to treat Lincoln not only as a giant of history, but something of a political contemporary. And a flawed one at that. Was Lincoln beatable? Trump says his pollsters told him could have defeated a ticket of George Washington and Lincoln had the two men whose faces are carved on Mount Rushmore come back from the dead and run against him in 2020.",
      "One of the pollsters Trump name-checked, John McLaughlin, said in an interview that Trump may have been the one who first said he could have beaten the Washington-Lincoln ticket.",
      "\u201cHe might have brought it up and I might have agreed with him,\u201d McLaughlin said with a laugh. \u201cHe [Trump] is certainly the best I ever met. He might have brought it up, and I might have said, \u2018Sure.\u2019\u201d",
      "Could Trump have come up with the deal that eluded Lincoln, averting the Civil War altogether?",
      "None of this is knowable, but Trump relishes these sorts of counterfactuals. He likes to say that neither Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel nor Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine would have happened had he been president.",
      "So, it\u2019s not a leap to reckon that the author of \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d might believe he has the singular skills to achieve what the antebellum politicians could not.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has complete confidence that in any situation, he can enforce his will and bring about a positive outcome,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cHe absolutely believes that he could have taken the situation between the North and South and negotiated a deal that would have ended chattel slavery and avoided the Civil War.\u201d",
      "\u201cHistorians will look at this era as the Age of Trump,\u201d Bannon added. \u201cAll of us will be forgotten: Elon Musk, Tucker Carlson, Steve Bannon. What people will remember is Trump and the MAGA movement.\u201d",
      "By the time Lincoln took office, the nation was already unraveling. Seven southern states seceded from the union between his election and swearing-in. Confederate forces fired on the U.S. garrison at Fort Sumter in South Carolina the month after his inauguration.",
      "Trump hasn\u2019t laid out how a peaceful settlement could have been reached, but at least one historian says the price of a settlement would have been leaving slavery intact.",
      "\u201cA lot of people wanted Lincoln to settle in 1861 and they were all Confederates or ambivalent Americans who had business connections with the South,\u201d said Ted Widmer, an historian and author of the book \u201cLincoln on the Verge.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere was no way to settle unless you were prepared to live with permanent slavery in the United States or cave in to extremists who didn\u2019t even care about the country.\u201d"

      "President Joe Biden plans to deliver two major speeches before leaving office as part of an effort to outline what he sees as key parts of his legacy from more than 50 years in public service, according to two people familiar with the plans.",
      "The first speech is set to focus on foreign policy and is expected to be delivered sometime after Biden returns on Jan. 12 from a trip to Italy, these people said. They said Biden then plans to close out his final days in the White House with a farewell address to the country.",
      "Neither speech has been fully drafted, the sources familiar with the president\u2019s plans said, but the contours and themes of both have been developed.",
      "In his farewell address, Biden is expected to offer a message to Americans for the future and reflect on his decades in public office, including his four years in the White House, according to the people familiar with the president\u2019s plans.",
      "The traditional address is expected to channel a similar spirit to the parting sentiments offered by some of Biden\u2019s recent predecessors, including former Presidents George W. Bush\u00a0and Bill Clinton,\u00a0who delivered their farewell speeches from the White House, and former President Barack Obama, who opted to speak to the nation from his hometown of Chicago in front of a large audience of supporters.",
      "After losing the 2020 election, President-elect Donald Trump posted a pre-recorded video message online the day before Biden was sworn in to office.",
      "Biden\u2019s foreign policy speech is set to focus on his belief that America is stronger when it invests in its alliances across the world, according to the people familiar with the president\u2019s speeches. Biden is expected to highlight his efforts to broaden and strengthen the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and U.S. relations in the Indo-Pacific, as well as his administration\u2019s military and financial support for Ukraine since Russia\u2019s invasion in 2022.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how much the speech might touch on Biden\u2019s decision to order the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, which has been widely criticized and resulted in the deaths of 13 American service members.",
      "Biden is likely to reference his administration\u2019s efforts to combat terrorist groups, including ISIS, but the speech is not expected to dwell on domestic terrorism threats following the New Year\u2019s Day attack in New Orleans, the people familiar with the president\u2019s plans said.",
      "The administration is looking at additional steps it could take before Biden leaves office to try to help prevent attacks driven by homegrown radicalization, a person familiar with the discussions said.",

      "On Thursday, Biden is scheduled to travel to Rome and Vatican City for a three-day visit, likely his final international travel in office.",
      "And before leaving the White House on Jan. 20, the president is expected to issue additional pardons, specifically focused on sentencing disparities, a person familiar with the plans said. This person said Biden has not decided whether to pre-emptively pardon people who could be targeted by the new Trump administration for retribution, though Biden would not pardon anyone who does not want to receive clemency."

    "published": "Sat, 04 Jan 2025 21:34:08 GMT",
    "summary": "At a closed-door House Republican retreat Saturday morning, newly re-elected House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said President-elect Donald Trump was in favor of passing a single reconciliation bill that would address his priorities, including border security, energy and an extension of his signature 2017 tax law, two sources with direct knowledge told NBC News.",

      "At a closed-door House Republican retreat Saturday morning, newly re-elected House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said President-elect Donald Trump was in favor of passing a single reconciliation bill that would address his priorities, including border security, energy and an extension of his signature 2017 tax law, two sources with direct knowledge told NBC News.",
      "Since the November election, when Republicans took back control of the White House and the Senate and retained control of the House, GOP lawmakers have publicly debated whether to attempt to pass one or two reconciliation bills to advance their agenda.",
      "Reconciliation allows Congress to pass party-line policies related to taxes and spending with simple majority votes, suspending the Senate\u2019s usual 60-vote threshold needed to pass legislation.",
      "With a razor-thin House Republican majority and a four-seat GOP Senate majority, Republican lawmakers would still have little wiggle room to lose GOP votes, even when passing laws using reconciliation.",
      "Johnson\u2019s revelation that Trump is in favor of a single reconciliation bill is important because some in the president-elect\u2019s orbit, including those who will be involved in negotiating any package like his immigration policy adviser Stephen Miller, have been pushing Republicans for two separate reconciliation bills: one tackling immigration and the other focusing on Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts, which will expire later this year.",
      "Trump\u2019s endorsement of just one bill will be welcome news to many in leadership but could be a blow to some hard-liners who want the border addressed immediately.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., endorsed a two-bill strategy in December, and Republicans in the chamber have already begun setting up the process for a border-only reconciliation bill.",
      "\u201cIn my view, it makes sense to move quickly on things we know we can do quickly \u2014 border, defense, energy,\u201d Thune told reporters last month. \u201cAnd then come back with another package that would address some of the savings that can be achieved through reductions in cost in various agencies and bureaucracies and government programs and then also deal with the expiring Trump tax cuts in a package later this year.\u201d",
      "Most Republicans in Congress have raised issues with attempting two budget bills in a single year through the wonky process that allows them to bypass the 60-vote threshold. It would be a heavy lift unifying the party around two massive bills, they say, rather than just one, and could unnecessarily expend political capital.\u00a0Lawmakers tasked with crafting tax policy, who are already plotting the tax package, are also worried that splitting the bills into two would raise the price tag of extending Trump\u2019s tax cuts and add to the deficit \u2014 a red line for many in the GOP.",
      "Spokespeople for Trump\u2019s transition team and Thune did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

These claims are completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media. Wayfarer Studios made the decision to proactively hire a crisis manager prior to the marketing campaign of the film, to work alongside their own representative with Jonesworks employed by Stephanie Jones, due to the multiple demands and threats made by Ms. Lively during production which included her threatening to not showing up to set, threatening to not promote the film, ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met.\u00a0It was also discovered that Ms. Lively enlisted her own representative, Leslie Sloan with Vision PR, who also represents Mr. Reynolds, to plant negative and completely fabricated and false stories with media, even prior to any marketing had commenced for the film, which was another reason why Wayfarer Studios made the decision to hire a crisis professional to commence internal scenario planning in the case they needed to address.\u00a0The representatives of Wayfarer Studios still did nothing proactive nor retaliated, and only responded to incoming media inquiries to ensure balanced and factual reporting and monitored social activity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What is pointedly missing from the cherry-picked correspondence is the evidence that there were no proactive measures taken with media or otherwise; just internal scenario planning and private correspondence to strategize which is standard operating procedure with public relations professionals.\u201d",

      "\u201cI thought she was way out of my league,\u201d he said. \u201cI might have a wild imagination of possibilities in life, obviously, but not in a million years did I think that somebody like that would be interested in me. At all.\"",
      "The \"Wild Hearts\" singer noted that he met Kidman during a difficult time in his life. After a friend passed along Kidman's number, Urban felt frozen. \"I kept looking at it thinking, \u2018If I call this number, she\u2019s going to answer. I don\u2019t know what (to) say,\u2019\u201d he explained.",
      "At the time, Urban said he lacked confidence. \"I wasn\u2019t in a very healthy place in my life. I\u2019d never have thought she\u2019d see anything in a guy like me,\" he said.",
      "When he finally called, their connection was seamless. \"We started talking and we talked and talked and talked and talked and it was effortless,\" he said.",
      "The couple's wedding took place in 2006, and Kidman can recall the exact moment she knew she wanted to marry Urban",
      "Urban and Kidman were married in a ceremony in Sydney in June 2006, per People.",

      "\u201cI was very, very blessed to have Nic call an intervention on me. I had a tight group of friends around me for the intervention,\u201d Urban told Rolling Stone. Reflecting on the intervention with Oprah on the \"Oprah Winfrey Show\" in 2010, Urban said, \"(The intervention) was done in such a way that the love in that room at that moment was just right. I was like, \u2018Put the cuffs on, let\u2019s go.\u2019\u201d",

      "\"When you have your partner who just literally carries you through a tough time ... Oh, he\u2019s been amazing to me,\u201d Kidman told DeGeneres. \u201cTo have my husband to step up in that way it makes me cry. I\u2019ll do anything for that man.\"",
      "Urban 'does not get involved' in Kidman's career",
      "In her career as an actor, Kidman occasionally has to shoot intimate scenes with her co-stars. According to Kidman, Urban doesn't mind that aspect of her job.",

      "\u201cHe sees the show at the very end when it\u2019s a show, all edited together, and his fresh eyes. He doesn\u2019t read any script, he really doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on on the set, he\u2019s got his own career that he\u2019s completely absorbed in,\" she added.",

      "Living in Los Angeles has proven to be beneficial in more ways than one for Luke Wilson.",
      "Not only has the actor called LA his home for more than two decades, but it\u2019s also provided plenty of fodder for his latest role as JD Campbell in the new Netflix series \u201cNo Good Deed.\u201d Campbell is a washed-up soap star, or, as Wilson puts it, \u201ca not-very-smart guy.\u201d",
      "\"For me, it was funny to play an empty-headed soap opera actor. I heard the description of the character, and it just started making me laugh just thinking of the ideas you could bring to it,\" Wilson tells TODAY.com in a sit-down interview.",
      "\"I mean, just living in LA, you come across successful actors and people that want to be successful actors, and there's all kinds of material for it,\" he explains.",
      "Wilson is no stranger to the Hollywood-style hijinx that play out in \"No Good Deed,\" a dark comedy that revolves around a group of scheming LA house hunters hoping to score a home being sold by Lydia and Paul Morgan (Lisa Kudrow and Ray Romano), a grieving couple with some surprising secrets of their own.",

      "After giving birth to her twin boys in Season 5, Charmaine adjusted to life as a new mom in Season 6. She wanted to shield her sons from their father Calvin (David Cubitt), a known criminal, but he insisted on being involved in their lives.",
      "In an effort to discourage Calvin and keep her family safe, Charmaine started the process of taking out a restraining order against her children's father.",
      "The hairstylist was supposed to help Mel and her bridal party get ready for her wedding to Jack (Martin Henderson), but was a no-show on the big day. The next morning, Mel was concerned that Charmaine wasn't answering her phone. Jack volunteered to stop by Charmaine's house to check in on her.",

      "\u2018Virgin River\u2019 fans have a theory about Charmaine\u2019s baby and Mel and Jack\u2019s adoption plans",
      "Throughout \u201cVirgin River,\u201d Mel has expressed her desire to become a mother, but it\u2019s been a heartbreaking road filled with several miscarriages.",
      "Now that Mel and Jack have opened up their hearts to adoption, some viewers are wondering if the show\u2019s writers will continue the parenthood arc by killing off Charmaine and leaving the couple to adopt her twin sons.",
      "One Reddit user made the following prediction, writing, \u201cOk, I\u2019ll go first.... Charmaine \u2014 is dead. The babies (sic) father killed her. The father goes to prison and Mel and Jack raise the twins.\u201d",
      "In the same thread, another Reddit user another theory riffing on the same idea: \u201cCharmaine has been kidnapped but the babies were left behind. Mel and Jack take the babies until Charmaine is found. While Charmaine is gone (this could be 5 years we know how they like to do her) they adopt the baby that\u2019s up for adoption.\u201d",
      "Over on X, viewers were equally intrigued, with one user penning the following reaction to the Season 6 finale: \u201cSo is Charmaine dead, Calvin dead! Will Jack and Mel end up adopting the other baby!\u201d",
      "Another X user agrees with the adoption theory \u2014 but has mixed feelings over what it means for Charmaine: \"I don\u2019t even want to think this but did Jack see Charmaine hurt or worse and him and Mel will get the twins?\"",
      "The cliffhanger also revived questions of Charmaine's twins' parentage. She told Jack that he was the father when she was first pregnant, then revealed Calvin was.",

      "\u201cI really think the plot with Charmaine will not be as exciting or shocking as people want it to be. I don\u2019t think anything happened to her or the babies. The house was probably a mess because Charmaine was overwhelmed taking care of them,\u201d they wrote.",

    "title": "Anger over changes to school curriculum exposes Syria's fragile unity",
    "published": "Sat, 04 Jan 2025 10:00:10 GMT",
    "summary": "Changes announced to Syria's school curriculum have sparked backlash over fears that Ahmed al-Sharaa and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham planned an Islamist future.",
    "story": [
      "In the scramble to rewrite Syria\u2019s future, it is perhaps no surprise that the classroom would lay bare cracks in the country\u2019s fragile unity.",
      "Widespread outcry followed an announcement that Syria\u2019s new leadership was planning sweeping changes to the country\u2019s education curriculum. To some wary of the rebel leaders who toppled the Assad regime last month, the changes were seen as a hint of their intent to install an Islamist agenda in the country\u2019s schools \u2014 and beyond.",
      "Syria\u2019s education ministry announced the changes in a post on Facebook on Wednesday, the first day of the new year, sharing 16 pages of planned modifications to the country\u2019s educational curriculum.",
      "Some of the changes were less surprising, such as removing all references to ousted dictator Bashar al-Assad and his late father, Hafez al-Assad.",
      "Others, however, sparked swift backlash.",
      "References to the pre-Islamic queen of the ancient city of Palmyra, Queen Zenobia, were to be removed, as were the names and images of pre-Islamic deities from the high school curriculum. Meanwhile, in the third-grade Islamic education book, the phrase \u201cthe brave one who defends the homeland\u201d was modified to \u201cfor the sake of Allah.\u201d",
      "The announcement sparked intense concern.",
      "\u201cOf course, it makes sense to remove glorification of the fallen regime and related concepts, but erasing historical facts and events from the struggles of our people, stations from the history of ancient civilizations ... and irrational modifications to all subjects in the curriculum are indicators and steps, not coincidence,\u201d Syrian writer and human rights activist Rima Flihan wrote in a Facebook post on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cAnd here lies the danger,\u201d said Flihan, a former member of the Syrian National Coalition, appearing to allude to concerns that have pervaded the cautious optimism of Syrians across the country since Assad\u2019s overthrow, in particular among the nation\u2019s myriad religious and ethnic minorities.",
      "However, the education ministry clarified a day later that curricula would remain largely \u201cunchanged\u201d \u2014 at least until specialized committees could be formed to review and scrutinize them.",
      "It was not immediately clear if this was a response to mounting public outrage. \u201cIt was a hasty step and they backed away from it,\u201d Syrian researcher and writer Hossam Jazmati told NBC News on Friday, sharing his interpretation of events.",
      "Education Minister Nazir al-Qadri said in a statement to NBC News that \"what has been done to the curricula is the removal of certain paragraphs, not an amendment. The curricula remain unchanged and have not been withdrawn from students. Those who scrutinize the replaced phrases linguistically will notice that there is no issue with what has been modified.\"",
      "Al-Qadri said that \"what was deleted is what glorifies the former regime and its followers.\" He added that \"changes and amendments to the curriculum will occur only after the situation stabilizes in Syria. As for now, there are no amendments, only the removal of certain phrases. There is a significant difference between a comprehensive modification and the mere deletion of some paragraphs.\"",
      "Syria\u2019s de facto leader is Ahmad al-Sharaa, head of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, the rebel group that led the overthrow of the Assad regime. He has vowed to build a future Syria on the promise of an inclusive and representative society.",
      "But the group\u2019s extremist past has stoked doubts, and it remains to be seen whether Sharaa, who has said new elections in Syria could take as long as four years, and his interim government will make good on that vow as they seek to persuade Western nations to lift crippling sanctions on Syria that targeted the Assad regime.",
      "Jazmati, who has written extensively about Sharaa, said the outrage over the curriculum reflected the \u201cgreat chaos at the top of the pyramid in Damascus\u201d as the country\u2019s rebel leadership seeks to maintain its power while transforming the country in what has largely become a process of trial and error.",
      "After more than a decade of civil war, the Assad regime fell in a swift burst of force from rebel groups last month. Now, Jazmati said of their leaders, \u201cgreat and unexpected responsibilities have fallen upon them all.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is constant adaptation,\u201d he said, and a \u201dgreat deal of experimentation.\u201d",
      "It is unclear just how much Syria\u2019s new leadership consulted with representatives of the country\u2019s diversity of communities prior to announcing the changes to the education system. But Jazmati speculated that given the speed with which Syria\u2019s caretaker government has sought to usher in new changes, it was likely relatively little.",
      "Sharaa has been juggling leading a country devastated by years of brutal dictatorship and civil war with the consuming task of representing Syria\u2019s new leadership on the international stage \u2014 he met with the foreign ministers of Germany and France on Friday, the first high-level European delegation.",
      "All that has been complicated by scrutiny over Sharaa's past as a jihadist leader with links to both the\u00a0Islamic State\u00a0terrorist group and\u00a0Al Qaeda.",
      "What exactly his true vision is for Syria, and whether he will be able to enact it, remains to be seen. The textbooks of the nation\u2019s youth may offer an indication."

    "summary": "The Netherlands has named 425,000 people suspected of collaborating with the Nazis during World War Two as part of The Huygens Institute\u2019s \u201cWar in Court\u201d project,",
    "story": [
      "It has long been a source of shame as much as curiosity.",
      "Now, some 80 years later, the names of those suspected of collaborating with the Nazis have been made public in the Netherlands as the country goes to new lengths to document the extent of its complicity in the horrors perpetrated by the Third Reich.",
      "In the country where teenage diarist Anne Frank is the most famous victim of the Holocaust, a historical research group funded by the Dutch government has for the first time published a list of nearly half a million people suspected of collaboration during World War II, after a law prohibiting its release expired on New Year\u2019s Day.",
      "The Huygens Institute\u2019s \u201cWar in Court\u201d project, which received an $18.5 million (18 million euros) grant from the three Dutch ministries that govern education, health and justice, has made public a digital archive that includes a list of 425,000 mostly Dutch people who were investigated for collaborating with the Netherlands\u2019 Nazi occupiers.",
      "The archive is \u201can extraordinary resource, and one that is very timely in terms of the Dutch debates about World War II and levels of collaboration,\u201d said Dan Stone, a professor of modern history at Royal Holloway, University of London.",
      "\u201cAt the very least, it shows that huge numbers of people were accused of collaborating with the Nazi occupier,\u201d Stone told NBC News by email. \u201cAnd the fact that relatively few were imprisoned probably tells us as much about postwar Dutch society as it does about the wartime facts.\u201d",
      "Of those in the database, only a fifth ever appeared in court, with most cases concerning more minor offenses such as membership in the Nazi party, Reuters reported. According to the Dutch central statistics bureau, in 1939 \u2014 the year World War II broke out \u2014 the country\u2019s population was 8.7 million. That would make just under 5% of the country suspected collaborators.",
      "Germany invaded the Netherlands in 1940 and occupied the country until the allied liberation in 1945.",
      "During that period, more than 100,000 Dutch Jews \u2014 around three-quarters of those in the country \u2014 were killed in the Holocaust, with approximately 6 million Jews murdered overall alongside the Nazis\u2019 political opponents and members of other groups declared to be inferior, such as Roma and LGBTQ people."

      "Holding the motionless body of his newborn baby wrapped in a blanket, Yahya Al-Batran imagines what his son, Jumaa, would say if he could speak.",
      "\u201cI left you for God, Daddy,\u201d Batran says as Jumaa, eyes open and dressed in a sweater too big for his frail body, lies still in his arms.",
      "Jumaa is one of at least five children to have succumbed to the bitter cold and difficult conditions consuming Gaza this winter amid Israel\u2019s deadly offensive in the Palestinian enclave, according to local health officials.",
      "His twin brother, Ali, was fighting for his life in intensive care, officials at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah told NBC News on Wednesday, after Batran and his wife woke up to find the two infants, who were born premature, lying motionless in their tent days ago.",
      "In an interview with NBC News\u2019 crew on the ground on Sunday, Batran recounted how he woke to the sounds of his wife desperately trying to rouse their newborn twins as they lay motionless in the cold tent \u2014 now home to the family of eight after they had fled from northern Gaza\u2019s Beit Lahia.They raced Jumaa and Ali to the Al-Aqsa hospital, but it was too late for baby Jumaa, Batran said. \u201cHe was frozen.\u201d",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t protect my children. I watched them die in front of my eyes,\u201d Batran said, describing how he had slept without a blanket at night, using everything the family had to keep his children warm.",
      "Temperatures in Gaza dropped below 45 degrees Fahrenheit at night this week, while heavy rains flooded more than 1,500 tents sheltering displaced families across the enclave, according to Gaza\u2019s Civil Defense agency.Local health officials say more than 45,000 people have been killed in Israel\u2019s offensive in the enclave, where children not only confront the daily reality of Israeli attacks, but have also been displaced from their homes amid an almost complete destruction of services.",
      "Winter weather has added another deadly challenge.",
      "\u201cIt is so cold now in winter that ... there have been three newborn deaths just in the last week because of the tents and the lack of foods available for them unfortunately,\u201d Dr. Mimi Sayed, an American emergency physician volunteering at the Al-Aqsa hospital, told NBC News\u2019 crew on the ground in an interview Tuesday.",
      "\u201cNothing compares to what\u2019s happening in\u00a0Gaza,\u201d said Sayed.",
      "M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, or Doctors Without Borders, sounded the alarm Friday, warning they expected more infants to be affected by hypothermia. Speaking in a voice recording published by MSF in a post on X, Dr. Mohammad Abu Tayyem, a pediatrician at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, said that doctors were seeing an \"increased number of children with respiratory infections like acute bronchiolitis, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infections and even bronchial asthma exacerbations.\"",
      "And, he said, \u201cdue to the increased number of premature babies and the low-birth-weight babies in this period in the ICU, we\u2019re expecting more babies to come to our ER complaining from hypothermia\" as he attributed their suffering to the cold weather and poor conditions children are being forced to live in amid Israel's offensive.",
      "Babies are unable to regulate their body temperature in the same way that adults can, making them particularly vulnerable to cold weather without adequate shelter and warm clothing \u2014 both in short supply.",
      "Asked to respond to reports of infants displaced by Israel\u2019s assault dying from the cold weather, IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani told reporters the military had looked into those reports but could not find any \u201cinformation we can work with\u201d from sources who were \u201cnot Hamas-related.\u201d\u201cThe reality of war is a tough thing and obviously that\u2019s part of why we don\u2019t start wars,\u201d he said on Thursday, adding that hostages taken captive during Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 terror attack were also experiencing winter in Gaza. He said Israeli officials were working to bring \u201cequipment for the winter\u201d into the enclave, but did not elaborate on those efforts.",
      "Meanwhile, video captured by NBC News' crew on the ground showed families across a tent encampment in Khan Younis trying to shovel and sweep dirty rainwater from their tents, while others gathered around a soup kitchen in the rain, holding out pots and pans and crying out for warm food.",
      "\u201cWe had a wonderful life, but look at how we have become,\u201d said 11-year-old Marwan Amer El-Akhres, who was helping his family try to move water away from their tent. \u201cWe have become so humiliated.\"",
      "\u201cIt is very hard and cold. It\u2019s freezing,\u201d he said.",
      "Recalling a time when his family, displaced from Rafah, had been able to sit safe and warm in their home \u201cenjoying the warm of winter,\u201d he said: \u201cNow, look at this.\u201d",
      "\u201cIs this a life?\u201d"

      "Concerns are growing for the safety of a prominent hospital director in Gaza who was taken into Israeli custody after the Israel Defense Forces raided the site, detained scores of people and forced the closure of one of the last functioning medical facilities in the enclave's north.",
      "Video captured outside Kamal Adwan Hospital and verified by NBC News shows its director, Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, wearing a white medical overcoat and walking alone toward a military vehicle. The street is strewn with rubble and the buildings around him appear destroyed, the video shared widely on social media shows.",
      "While it isn't clear exactly when the video was shot, the Israeli military confirmed Monday that it had detained and interrogated Abu Safiya. He was being held as a \"suspect\" and being questioned over \"potential involvement in terrorist activity,\" IDF spokesperson Nadav Shoshani said in a post on X.",
      "Before his detention, Abu Safiya, a pediatrician, repeatedly warned about the IDF's raid on the hospital and how it endangered patients, including premature babies.",
      "On Friday, he posted video on his Instagram account showing a quadcopter dropping a bomb a few yards from Kamal Adwan Hospital, with the bomb exploding with a loud bang before sending plumes of smoke into the air.",
      "On Friday, video geolocated by NBC News to the area around the hospital showed a crowd of men stripped down to minimal clothing walking in a line with their hands raised. Separately, NBC News' crew on the ground in Gaza captured video of a blaze tearing through several units at the hospital on the same day. In it, people could be seen racing to try to douse the flames with buckets of water, while others sifted through the rubble.",
      "Shoshani previously said there was no connection between the fire and the IDF's activities at the site.",
      "Since Friday, there has been no sign of Abu Safiya, with international organizations, including the World Health Organization, sounding the alarm and demanding his release.",
      "\"Hospitals in Gaza have once again become battlegrounds and the health system is under severe threat,\" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Monday in a statement on X, adding that Kamal Adwan was forced to go out of service following the IDF's raid.",

      "Hospitals and medical workers are considered protected under international law, which states that they must never become targets in warfare.",
      "Asked to confirm Abu Safiya\u2019s whereabouts and why he was detained, the IDF declined to respond.",
      "The IDF alleged that Kamal Adwan had been used as a \"Hamas command center.\" More than 240 people were detained over the weekend, all of them \u201cterrorists,\u201d it added in a statement.",
      "Sharing a photo of Abu Safiya, over the weekend, the international human rights group Amnesty International said it was \"extremely concerned over the fate & wellbeing\" of the medical director.",

      "But Ghebreyesus said that at least four patients were detained during WHO's efforts. \"We urge Israel to ensure their health care needs and rights are upheld,\" he said.",
      "Meanwhile, the WHO director-general noted that multiple other hospitals in Gaza had also been attacked over the past several days.",
      "The IDF said it has been \u201cwell documented that Hamas uses hospitals and medical centers\u201d for its operations and pointed to weapons and tunnel systems found at and around hospitals. It also pointed to the alleged confession of former Kamal Adwan Hospital Director Ahmad Kahalot, whom the IDF detained last year and said had confessed to being a senior Hamas member.",
      "Local health officials vehemently dispute claims that medical centers are used by Hamas or other militants. NBC News was not able to independently verify the IDF\u2019s claims.",
      "Israeli forces' repeated attacks on hospitals and medical facilities in Gaza have left the enclave's health care system decimated amid a spiraling humanitarian crisis, with most facilities damaged or destroyed in Israel's more than a yearlong military offensive.",
      "\"If a hospital has been reduced to a bombed-out shell, it would cease to be protected, but otherwise a hospital, whether immediately used or not, is presumptively protected as an important civilian institution,\" Kenneth Roth, former executive director of Human Rights Watch, previously told NBC News. \"It can be attacked only if actively used for military purposes, and even then, only if the civilian harm is not disproportionate.\"",
      "The Illinois-based nonprofit organization MedGlobal was also among those to condemn the IDF's attack on Kamal Adwan Hospital, calling it a \"brutal violation of a protected medical space\" as it echoed calls for Abu Safiya's release.",

      "2025 is shaping up to be a defining year for Ukraine.",
      "After a year of significant gains for Russia, looming large is the presidency of Donald Trump, who has pledged to end the war in \u201ca single day\u201d \u2014 even if he has indicated that he is in part sympathetic to Moscow\u2019s arguments and has remained skeptical of promising open-ended military aid to Kyiv.",
      "Some experts believe that, for this reason, it\u2019s likely that Ukraine, and Europe, will need to prepare for a prolonged war.",
      "\u201cTrump, with his unpredictable policy on military support for Kyiv and on how to end the war, will be the biggest challenge,\u201d Justyna Gotkowska, the deputy director of the Center for Eastern Studies, a think tank based in Warsaw, said in an op-ed last week.",
      "After more than 1,000 days of war, Ukraine is running short on manpower while the Kremlin has stepped up bombings of cities and infrastructure, launching missiles, drones and artillery rounds at civilian targets.",
      "Nearly a fifth of Ukraine\u2019s territory is now occupied by the Russian forces, though Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive efforts have driven the fight onto Russian land, where large swathes of territory in the Kursk border region have been seized.",
      "And while the country has successfully fended off a number of air attacks in recent months, the Ukrainian military chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, conceded on the Telegram messenger app that Russian troops have advanced significantly in the eastern Donetsk region in the past few months. The area of Pokrovsk, a Ukrainian defense linchpin, could especially pave the way for Moscow to seize swathes of more territory.",
      "Ahead of Trump\u2019s inauguration on Jan. 20, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy now walks a diplomatic tightrope.",
      "\u201cZelenskyy\u2019s greater challenge right now is to ensure continued U.S. military assistance to Ukraine,\u201d said Ann Dailey, a policy researcher at the RAND Corporation, a California-based think tank.",
      "As Ukraine\u2019s most important military backer, the U.S. has given Kyiv nearly $61.4 billion in military assistance. On Monday, the White House pledged another $2.5 billion \u2014 likely the last steps taken by the Biden administration in that direction.",
      "On the other hand, Trump has made clear that he does not wholeheartedly support Kyiv\u2019s war against Vladimir Putin\u2019s invading forces.",
      "In an interview with NBC\u2019s Kristen Welker earlier this month, the president-elect said Ukraine would \u201cprobably\u201d receive less military aid once he takes office, contending that Europe should match the U.S.\u2019s level of support.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in for $350 billion, and Europe is in for $100 billion. Why isn\u2019t Europe in for the same as us?\u201d he said. \u201cThe one thing that should happen is that Europe ... should equalize.\u201d",
      "\u201cWar with Russia is more important for Europe than it is for us. We have a little thing called an ocean in between us,\u201d he added.",
      "Trump has been careful not to reveal much of his plan to end the war, though his choice of U.S. envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, presented a peace plan to Trump in April, a plan that involves putting pressure on both sides by cutting off military aid to Ukraine if it doesn\u2019t agree to negotiations, and expanding weapons shipments to Kyiv if Moscow refuses to come to the table.",
      "Trump also criticized Ukraine after it launched missiles into Russian territory last month: \u201cI disagree very vehemently with sending missiles hundreds of miles into Russia. Why are we doing that?\u201d he said in an interview with Time magazine earlier this month.",
      "Meanwhile, in recent weeks Trump\u2019s aides have pushed for a truce contingent on Kyiv delaying its membership to the NATO alliance by 20 years, in exchange for continued arms supply from the West and the deployment of European peacekeepers to monitor a ceasefire.",
      "But some experts say this will only invite the Kremlin to continue its efforts to undermine the European security order.",
      "\u201cMy biggest concern is that Ukraine will be pressured to accept a bad deal with Russia, as Donald Trump will be keen to deliver on his promise to stop the war,\u201d said Kristi Raik, the deputy director of the International Centre for Defence and Security, in an op-ed.",
      "In line with changing circumstances, Zelenskyy\u2019s public statements have also shifted, now emphasizing the need for long-term security over territorial control. Short of being open to painful concessions, the Ukrainian president has signaled a greater willingness to negotiate an end to the war.",
      "This shift comes after previous acknowledgments that it\u2019s unlikely Ukrainian forces will be able to roll back Russian troops from the seized territory, including the Crimean peninsula and parts of eastern Ukraine that Moscow has held for a decade.",
      "Putin, meanwhile, has been doing the equivalent of a victory lap.",
      "During his traditional end-of-year press conference on Dec. 19, he boasted that his forces were \u201cadvancing\u201d on the battlefield and that \u201cRussia\u2019s \u201cdefense capabilities are the highest in the world.\u201d",
      "Nonetheless, he said he was \u201cready to engage\u201d in peace talks with Ukraine, noting\u00a0that \u201cpolitics is the art of compromise.\u201d",
      "Putin referred to the 2022 peace talks held between the two countries in Istanbul, where the draft agreement discussed involved the Kremlin taking control over the Crimea and Donbas region, and with Ukraine giving up plans to join NATO and reducing its military.",
      "Those talks failed, with both sides blaming the other for the collapse.",
      "\u201cPutin placed particular emphasis on Russia being a rational actor by being willing to accept a ceasefire on its own terms and accusing the Ukrainian side of sabotaging a previous deal,\u201d said Natia Seskuria, an associate fellow at a London-based think tank, RUSI.",
      "But with Putin\u2019s usual threats of escalation on show, Russia is negotiating from a position of strength, rather than weakness \u2014 and it expects concessions from Ukraine with the help of the Trump administration.",
      "The Russian concept of negotiations is \u201cvery different from our own,\u201d said Dailey of the RAND Corporation. \u201cRussia just wants what it has wanted since it started this war.\u201d",
      "Putin has repeatedly voiced that deferring Ukraine\u2019s membership to NATO is not enough for Moscow. On Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov doubled down on the Russian president\u2019s position, saying that he would not consider the plans reportedly being put forward by Trump\u2019s team.",

      "Even if Trump tries to restore ties between the U.S. and Russia once he comes into office, he would have to \u201cswim against the current\u201d given the bipartisan consensus in the U.S. on Russia \u2014 which is \u201cnot so simple,\u201d Lavrov added.",

      "While Zelenskyy has pushed for NATO membership as a necessary move to safeguard Ukraine from future invasions, Kyiv\u2019s prospects seem largely unattainable in both the U.S. and Europe, where leaders appear divided over which security pledges they can offer Kyiv.",
      "Nevertheless, Zelenskyy has repeatedly stated that Ukraine needs unequivocal support from the U.S. alongside European guarantees.",
      "\u201cIt is very important for us to have both on board: the United States and the Europeans,\u201d he said during recent talks held in Brussels."

But enforcing them is complicated as long as Yoon remains in his official residence.",

      "The Assembly overturned the declaration within hours in a unanimous vote\u00a0and impeached Yoon on Dec. 14, accusing him of rebellion, while South Korean anti-corruption authorities and public prosecutors opened separate investigations into the events.",

Park said he instructed his members not to use violence during their standoff with investigators and called for the anti-corruption agency and police to change their approach.",

The team said it will also file complaints with public prosecutors against the country\u2019s acting defense minister and police chief for ignoring the presidential security service\u2019s request to provide additional forces to block the detention attempt.",

      "Israeli airstrikes killed at least 170 people, including several children, in Gaza over the past week and hit an Israeli-declared humanitarian zone, local officials said, deepening the humanitarian crisis in the enclave as it grapples with the effects of a winter under siege.",
      "Rights groups raise alarm",
      "Independent experts appointed by the U.N. Human Rights Council said they were \u201cgravely concerned\u201d over the fate of Abu Safiya, \u201cyet another doctor to be harassed, kidnapped and arbitrarily detained\u201d by Israeli forces.",
      "In a statement released Thursday, U.N. Special Rapporteurs Dr. Tlaleng Mofokeng and Francesca Albanese noted that Abu Safiya\u2019s son was killed in front of him before he was detained, and that he was recently injured while on duty.",
      "An Israeli human rights group has filed a petition with the country\u2019s top court demanding to know the whereabouts of Abu\u00a0Safiya. Physicians for Human Rights \u2014 Israel (PHRI) said in a statement Thursday that Abu Safiya\u2019s case \u201cis part of a broader pattern of non-disclosure and unreliable information provided by the Israeli military and prison authorities regarding Palestinian detainees.\u201d",
      "Amnesty International Secretary General Agnes Callamard expressed extreme alarm over the latest information regarding the whereabouts of Abu Safiya.\u00a0She warned on X on Thursday that he was \u201cat great risk of torture and ill-treatment,\u201d calling on Israel to reveal his location.",

      "Video captured outside the hospital and verified by NBC News showed Abu Safiya, wearing a white medical overcoat and walking alone toward a military vehicle.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces initially confirmed that Abu Safiya had been detained and interrogated, saying that he was being held as a \u201csuspect\u201d and questioned over \u201cpotential involvement in terrorist activity.\u201d",
      "Amid growing outcry, the IDF said Thursday that Abu Safiya was \u201capprehended for suspected involvement in terrorist activities, and for holding a rank in the Hamas terror organization, while hundreds of Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists were hiding inside the Kamal Adwan Hospital under his management.\u201d",
      "It said he was currently being investigated by Israeli forces. The IDF did not respond to a request for comment from NBC News on where Abu Safiya was being held, after family members and fellow detainees raised concerns in media interviews that he was at the Sde Teiman military base in southern Israel.",
      "Israel\u2019s ambassador to the U.N., Daniel Meron, said Friday that the raid on Kamal Adwan was triggered by \u201cirrefutable evidence\u201d that the facility was being used by Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants. He said Israeli forces had taken \u201cextraordinary measures to protect civilian life while acting on credible intelligence.\u201d",
      "Meron\u2019s justification for the raid was written in a letter posted on X and addressed to the World Health Organization, as well as U.N. human rights official Volker T\u00fcrk.",
      "But T\u00fcrk told the U.N. Security Council on Friday that Israel did not \u201csubstantiate many of these claims,\u201d many of which, he said, \u201cappear to be contradicted by publicly available information.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am calling for independent, thorough and transparent investigations into all Israeli attacks on hospitals, health care infrastructure and medical personnel, as well as the alleged misuse of such facilities,\u201d he told the 15-member body.",

    "summary": "A convicted fraudster with a violent criminal record, Tommy Robinson has become the latest cause championed by the richest person on the planet, Elon Musk.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014A convicted fraudster with a violent criminal record, Tommy Robinson is well known as the leader of the English far right, inspiring rallies of mostly white, mostly male followers shouting soccer-style chants against Islam and immigration.",
      "It has been jarring then, for many Britons to see Robinson \u2014 whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon \u2014 become the latest cause championed by the richest person on the planet, Elon Musk.",
      "\u201cFree Tommy Robinson!\u201d the billionaire entrepreneur and adviser to President-elect Donald Trump posted to his X social media network Thursday.",
      "Robinson, 42, is serving an 18-month jail sentence for contempt of court, a charge stemming from a libelous video in which he falsely claimed a Syrian refugee teenager was a violent thug.",
      "Widely disliked in Britain, Robinson\u2019s 19% popularity rating is even lower than Musk\u2019s at 26%, according to the latest findings published in October by YouGov, a British polling company.",
      "\u201cBut he will become less fringe if people adopt him \u2014 and that\u2019s the risk you have here,\u201d according to Scott Lucas, a University College Dublin professor specializing in British and American politics. \u201cTommy\u2019s an icon for certain far-right groups \u2014 and Musk knows that.\u201d",
      "This is far from Musk\u2019s first intervention in European politics, and he has increasingly opined on the subject since backing Trump\u2019s election win in November. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO has largely supported far-right nationalists, most recently in Germany. Their rise on the continent has coincided with Trump\u2019s second term, teeing up the prospect of transatlantic cooperation among this former political fringe.",
      "It is in Britain, however, where Musk has focused most attention.",
      "In recent months, he has accused Keir Starmer of running a \u201ctyrannical police state\u201d and going \u201cfull Stalin,\u201d a stark contrast to domestic criticism, which has often seen the prime minister accused of being too centrist and selling out his leftist roots.",
      "Musk also predicted Britain would descend into \u201ccivil war\u201d after the August murders of three girls in the northern seaside town of Southport sparked widespread rioting led by the far right. The disorder was partly blamed by both police and politicians on false rumors spread about their alleged killer on X, including by Musk himself.",
      "And on Friday, Musk supported a call for King Charles III to dissolve Parliament, which he technically has the power to do, but in Britain\u2019s constitutional monarchy has not been used against the wishes of a prime minister for almost two centuries",
      "Many treated this as little more than \u201cmuppetry and trolling\u201d as Sunder Katwala, director of the think tank British Future, put it on X.",
      "But Musk's interaction with Robinson has raised more eyebrows. Musk first started replying to Robinson on X in August, but that ramped up significantly this week when he began posting about Britain\u2019s \u201cgrooming gangs\u201d scandal.",
      "Decadelong investigations into gangs in regional towns and cities across the United Kingdom found groups of mostly men had systematically groomed and raped young girls.",
      "While \u201cresearch has found that group-based child sexual exploitation offenders are most commonly white,\u201d according to a 2023 study by the British government, some of these gangs were formed of men of Pakistani heritage, making it the source of outrage among the far right and also Conservative politicians.",
      "\u201cWhy is Tommy Robinson in a solitary confinement prison for telling the truth?\u201d Musk posted Wednesday, saying he should be \u201cfreed and those who covered up this travesty should take his place in that cell.\u201d",
      "But Robinson\u2019s October jailing is just his latest encounter with the law.",
      "He was first jailed in 2005 for assaulting an off-duty police officer, and ordered to do community service in 2011 for leading a brawl involving more than 100 soccer fans. He was imprisoned again in 2013 for traveling to the United States on another person\u2019s passport, then again a year later for mortgage fraud.",
      "Robinson, who took his pseudonym from a soccer hooligan, was also given a five-year stalking protection order in October 2021 after he shouted abuse outside the home of a journalist having learned she was planning a story about him.",
      "Under the conditions of the order, he was prohibited from contacting the journalist or attending any places where the person lives and works, unless specifically invited for an interview.",
      "During that time, he co-founded the English Defence League, or EDL, which rose out of a disparate network of far-right groups and whose virulently Islamophobic views were praised by Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d personally send every adult male Muslim that has come into the E.U. over the past 12 months back tomorrow if I could,\u201d Robinson said in 2016, and he has described Islam as \u201cfascist,\u201d according to the anti-extremism group Hope Not Hate.",
      "He has also hinted at violent retribution. In 2011, he said that the \u201cthe Islamic community will feel the full force of the English Defence League if we see any of our British citizens killed, maimed, or hurt on British soil ever again.\u201d",
      "Robinson is no longer associated with the EDL and has repeatedly stated that he is not racist or Islamophobic.",
      "In addition to his support for Robinson, Musk has also professed support for Nigel Farage, the British Trump ally who leads the anti-immigration Reform UK party. Farage said that Musk has given \u201cserious thought\u201d to making a donation to his political group. While certainly hard right, Reform, which has five parliamentary lawmakers, is considered a far more mainstream force than Robinson.",
      "Some pundits have suggested that Musk\u2019s endorsement of Robinson could harm Farage, who has sought to distance himself from the former EDL man. But can Musk\u2019s apparent fixation with British and European politics actually make a difference there?",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know, and that\u2019s the question,\u201d said Lucas at University College Dublin, who added that he believed that renewed focus on immigration \u2014 a democratic trend sweeping Europe \u2014 has at least opened the door.",
      "\u201cWhat we know is that British politics has already been damaged,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there\u2019s an opportunity for him to move the needle.\u201d"

    "summary": "President Joe Biden said Friday that he has decided to block a $15 billion takeover of U.S.",
    "story": [
      "President Joe Biden said Friday that he has decided to block a $15 billion takeover of U.S. Steel by the Japanese company Nippon Steel, capping off a yearlong business saga that drifted into election politics.",
      "A national security review by a Treasury Department committee\u00a0failed to reach\u00a0a consensus on the deal last month and deferred the final decision to the president. NBC News had reported in September that Biden\u00a0was preparing\u00a0to block the takeover.",
      "The president, who leaves office in little more than two weeks, faced a challenging political calculus over the fate of the iconic Pittsburgh-based firm: Allowing a foreign entity with far greater resources to take it over could put the business on stabler financial footing, while keeping U.S. Steel in American hands risked the company\u2019s survival under intense foreign competition. But the deal was opposed by a powerful steelworkers union.",
      "\"As I have said many times, steel production \u2014 and the steel workers who produce it \u2014 are the backbone of our nation,\" Biden said in a statement.\u00a0\"A strong domestically owned and operated steel industry represents an essential national security priority and is critical for resilient supply chains. ... Without domestic steel production and domestic steel workers, our nation is less strong and less secure.\"",
      "President-Elect Donald Trump had also voiced opposition to the takeover proposal during the 2024 presidential campaign. A Trump representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.",
      "U.S. Steel's stock fell more than 6% Friday.",
      "In a joint statement, U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel condemned Biden's decision, saying it \"reflects a clear violation of due process and the law.\" The companies also hinted at taking legal action.",
      "\"Instead of abiding by the law, the process was manipulated to advance President Biden\u2019s political agenda,\" the statement said. \"The President\u2019s statement and Order do not present any credible evidence of a national security issue, making clear that this was a political decision. Following President Biden\u2019s decision, we are left with no choice but to take all appropriate action to protect our legal rights.\"",
      "Later Friday, U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt released a statement ripping Biden, calling the president's decision \"shameful and corrupt.\"",
      "\"He insulted Japan, a vital economic and national security ally, and put American competitiveness at risk. The Chinese Communist Party leaders in Beijing are dancing in the streets. And Biden did it all while refusing to even meet with us to learn the facts,\" he wrote in the statement. \"We intend to fight President Biden\u2019s political corruption.\"",
      "The roughly 11,000-worker company, founded in 1901, has dwindled  since its heyday, when it employed a peak of roughly 340,000 during World War II. Its share price has barely edged higher since the 1990s as cheaper steel production abroad ramped up, especially in Asia.",
      "When reached for comment Thursday night, a spokesperson for U.S. Steel referred to a previous statement, saying that the deal \"enhances U.S. national and economic security through investment in manufacturing and innovation,\" going on to argue that the transaction would \"combat the competitive threat from China.\"",
      "\"It is the best way, by far, to ensure that U. S. Steel, including its employees, communities, and customers, will thrive well into the future,\" the spokesperson said.\u00a0\"It is our hope that President Biden will do the right thing and adhere to the law by approving a transaction that so clearly enhances U.S. national and economic security.\"",
      "Nippon Steel, Japan\u2019s largest steelmaker, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "United Steelworkers, the union representing many of the company\u2019s employees, hailed the announcement.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re grateful for President Biden\u2019s willingness to take bold action to maintain a strong domestic steel industry and for his lifelong commitment to American workers,\u201d the union said in a statement. \u201cMoving forward, we\u2019re confident that with responsible management, U.S. Steel will continue to support good jobs, healthy communities and robust national and economic security well into the future.\u201d",
      "Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro issued a separate statement calling on U.S. Steel to continue to continue to prioritize protecting jobs in the western part of the state.",
      "\u201cThis matter is far from over,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must find a long-term solution that protects the future of steelmaking in Western Pennsylvania and the workers who built U.S. Steel and built this country.\u201d",
      "The potential blocking of the deal had raised concerns that it could harm U.S. relations with Japan, a key U.S. ally and the country\u2019s largest foreign investor.",
      "There was no immediate comment from officials in Japan, where Friday was a bank holiday. Japanese government officials have previously declined to comment on matters concerning the management of individual companies but said it is essential for the U.S. and Japan to strengthen economic relations, \u201cincluding the expansion of mutual investment.\u201d",
      "American and international business groups have also criticized what they say is the politicization of the deal.",
      "The proposed acquisition drew controversy almost as soon as it was announced in December 2023, with Biden saying in a statement that month that it \u201cappears to deserve serious scrutiny in terms of its potential impact on national security and supply chain reliability.\u201d",
      "Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, both campaigned against the proposed acquisition, saying U.S. Steel should remain American-owned.",
      "Trump said in December that he would block the acquisition and revive U.S. Steel through a combination of tax incentives and tariffs.",
      "Nippon Steel tried to assuage politicians' concerns, saying in a statement in September that U.S. Steel would remain an American company owned by Nippon Steel North America. Nippon Steel also said that Americans would make up the majority of the board of directors of U.S. Steel, and that the American company, under its new ownership, would stay headquartered in Pittsburgh.",
      "\"Nippon Steel will prioritize production at U. S. Steel to meet the demand in the U.S. steel market,\" Nippon Steel said."
