      "BEIRUT -- BEIRUT (AP) \u2014 A Lebanese pop star turned wanted Islamic militant handed himself over to the country\u2019s military intelligence service Saturday 12 years after going on the run, judicial and security officials said.",
      "Fadel Shaker, had been on the run since the bloody street clashes between Sunni Muslim militants and the Lebanese army in June 2013 in the coastal city of Sidon. He was tried in absentia and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2020 for providing support to a \u201cterrorist group.\u201d",
      "On Saturday night, a Lebanese military intelligence force reached one of the entrances of the Palestinian refugee camp of Ein el-Hilweh near Sidon and took Shaker, who had been hiding inside the camp for more than 12 years, into custody, two security and two judicial officials said.",
      "The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, said the handover came after coordination between mediators and officials at the Lebanese Defense Ministry.",
      "The officials said that now that Shaker is being held by Lebanese authorities, the sentences that he received while on the run will be dropped and he will be questioned in preparation to stand trial on new charges of committing crimes against the military.",
      "Shaker had denied in the past playing any role in the clashes in Sidon and said he never advocated bloodshed.",

      "Shaker became a pop star throughout the Arab world in 2002 with a smash hit. Almost 10 years later, he fell under the influence of al-Assir and shocked fans by turning up next to the hard-line cleric at rallies and later saying that he was giving up singing to become closer to God.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A judge remained undecided Friday on the treatment and placement plan for a man charged with stalking Jennifer Aniston and ramming his car into the front gate of her home.",
      "Jimmy Wayne Carwyle, a 48-year-old from Mississippi, has pleaded not guilty to felony stalking and vandalism. But in May, Judge Maria Cavalluzzi found him not competent to stand trial after evaluations from two experts. At Friday\u2019s hearing in a Los Angeles court dedicated to mental health cases, she heard arguments on Carwyle's treatment and placement.",
      "Aniston\u2019s lawyer, Blair Berk, spoke on her behalf for the first time, detailing two years of Carwyle\u2019s harassment and stalking, including various failed attempts to make physical contact with the actor.",
      "Cavalluzzi said she leaned toward sending Carwyle to a mental health treatment alternative to imprisonment. She requested another hearing, scheduled for later this month, to hear from a mental health professional before making a final decision.",
      "Prosecutors and Aniston\u2019s attorney will have a chance to weigh in, Cavalluzzi said.",
      "The judge acknowledged Aniston's \u201cvery real\" fear, but she said she can't ignore the opinions of mental health professionals who have evaluated Carwyle and deemed him not a danger to society. The alternative treatment option offers community-based housing, treatment and support services as opposed to incarceration.",
      "Prosecutors alleged Carwyle had been harassing the \u201cFriends\u201d star with a flood of voicemail, email and social media messages for two years before driving his Chrysler PT Cruiser through the gate of her home in the wealthy Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles on May 5, \u201conly feet away from where she was,\u201d Berk said.",
      "Carwyle had a stated and \u201cpersistent delusion\u201d to impregnate Aniston with three children, Berk said, and \u201cthere is simply no way to prevent him from carrying out his delusion if he walks out.\u201d",
      "The prosecution expressed concern that if Carwyle were offered the treatment in Los Angeles, nothing would stop him \u201cfrom traveling those few miles to Ms. Aniston,\u201d Berk said.",
      "Berk and William Donovan, the deputy district attorney, argued Carwyle was a present danger to Aniston and those around her. Berk said he attempted to enter her property twice, but was turned away.",
      "Carwyle\u2019s lawyer, Robert Krauss, said his client qualifies for alternative treatment, arguing that he hasn\u2019t been convicted of violent crimes. Granting him alternative treatment, \u201cis not like giving him a break or showing him leniency,\u201d Krauss said. \u201cIts just one thing and one thing only \u2014 and that is absolute, pure faithfulness of the law.\u201d",
      "Krauss also referenced a report from the probation department, which recommended Carwyle be granted probation and 90 days in jail if convicted, much less than the over three years maximum sentence for his two charges. Carwyle has been in jail since May and, if convicted, could be let out with time served.",

      "When Cavalluzzi asked how she can be sure he won\u2019t walk away from the treatment program \u2014 a stated concern from the prosecution \u2014 Carwyle responded, \u201cYou have my word.\u201d",

      "Donovan argued that a state hospital is a \u201cmuch safer, much more effective place for him to go,\u201d and will offer the treatment Carwyle needs to address his delusions.

      "The hearing was postponed several times in recent months as Carwyle at first objected to the incompetence finding and asked for an opinion, and both sides sought more time to examine the case.",
      "Carwyle remains jailed, but he is under a judge's order not to contact or get near Aniston.",

      "Taylor Swift's 12th album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" shows she's still at the top of the cultural mainstream",
      "Who is Taylor Swift\u2019s heir apparent? Her 12th album, \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl,\u201d offers an answer. It\u2019s Taylor Swift.",
      "Her last album, \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d ended with the cautionary \u201cClara Bow,\u201d an allegory that seemed to suggest her tenure atop the cultural mainstream was inherited from stars of the past, like the namechecked Stevie Nicks \u2014 and that a new generation of younger, elastic female pop performers could soon take her place. In 2025, there are many to choose from: Consider Chappell Roan\u2019s full-throated theatrics, Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s fiery punk-pop feminism, Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s cheeky sexuality. In the knotty themes of Friday's \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl,\u201d best illustrated in the title track, Swift asserts that the baton hasn\u2019t been passed, but rather shared. Because she isn\u2019t going anywhere.",
      "\u201cAnd all the headshots on the walls / Of the dance halls are of the b------ / Who wish I\u2019d hurry up and die,\u201d she sings with a wink, \u201cBut I\u2019m immortal now, baby dolls / I couldn\u2019t if I tried.\u201d Notably, if she has a chosen successor in someone else, it\u2019s the album\u2019s sole feature: Carpenter, who sings on the stomp-clap closer in her newly adopted twang. The mournful glissando of lap steel \u2014 the album\u2019s most country moment \u2014 arrives only with Carpenter\u2019s introduction. The western genre is Swift\u2019s past and Carpenter\u2019s future.",
      "If Swift is co-signing Carpenter, she\u2019s also learning from her. Carpenter has cornered the market on tight pop songs with pert, provocative messages; Swift does the same with the manspreading swagger of the George Michael-interpolating \u201cFather Figure,\u201d which mentions a protege, and the funky \u201cWood.\u201d (A carefully veiled PG-13 lyric: \u201cHis love was the key / That opened my thighs,\u201d she sings. \u201cGirls, I don\u2019t need to catch the bouquet / To know a hard rock is on the way.\u201d) Interwoven are suggestive, sensual ad-libs ... and a direct reference to fiance Travis Kelce\u2019s podcast.",
      "Across a brisk 12 tracks \u2014 Swift\u2019s tendency toward abundance doesn\u2019t manifest itself in a double album this time around, but instead in her endless vinyl variants \u2014 \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d mostly delivers on its promise of up-tempo pop \u201cbangers,\u201d to borrow her own vernacular. Fans need not wait up for the long-anticipated \u201cReputation (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d because \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d pulls from its essence. But this time, with a lot of affection, like a truer \u201cLover\u201d era.",
      "Swift has long internalized criticisms and responded to them in her art, most directly in 2017\u2019s \u201cReputation.\u201d Here, she is once again concerned with her perception, articulated over booming, lush production on \u201cCANCELLED!\u201d or \u201cElizabeth Taylor.\u201d On the latter, she sings, \u201cHollywood hates me / You\u2019re only as hot as your last hit, baby.\u201d Except this time, her love acts as an anchor. \u201cI can\u2019t have fun if I can\u2019t have you,\u201d she flirts.",
      "For \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl,\u201d Swift enlisted Swedish producers Max Martin and Shellback, the hitmaking duo she collaborated with on 2012\u2019s \u201cRed,\u201d 2014\u2019s \u201c1989\u201d and, of course, \u201cReputation.\u201d Notably absent is her frequent producing partner Jack Antonoff. It\u2019s a wise decision: In years past, Swift, Shellback and Martin\u2019s pop experiments shifted not only her career trajectory but the genre itself. Before \u201cWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,\u201d an EDM drop in the middle of a radio pop hit was unimaginable. After, the style would dominate for half the decade.",
      "\u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d isn\u2019t as seismic, but there are addictive and idiosyncratic Swiftisms here: acerbic wit and thick literary references in glassy pop hooks. Where a song like \u201cOpalite,\u201d if attempted by another other performer, would lose its weightlessness under its voluble aspirations, Swift manages to swoon. Stacked, opalescent harmonies and a vintage swing give the song, fittingly, an almost iridescent quality.",
      "And there are bops, like the undeniable opener \u201cThe Fate of Ophelia\u201d with its 1980s-via-Robyn synth-pop and momentary \u201cSummertime Sadness\u201d vocal delivery.",
      "There\u2019s a treasure trove of deliciously quotable lines, too, as expected. \u201cPlease God bring me a best friend who I think is hot,\u201d she manages to make effortless in the \u201cMidnights\u201d-esque \u201cWi$h Li$t,\u201d a lovely song about the mundanity of romance and the suburban fantasy of \u201ca couple kids \u2026 a driveway with a basketball hoop.\u201d",
      "Swift\u2019s dense vocabulary is on full display, often full of charm. But it is sometimes unwieldy, a common criticism of \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d like when she overstuffs \u201cOur thoughtless ambition sparked the ignition on foolish decisions which led to misguided visions\u201d into \u201cFather Figure,\u201d momentarily overvaluing clever writing over clever cadence.",

      "Benny Safdie's The Smashing Machine\u201d would seem to bear all the hallmarks of something grittier, darker and more disturbing than it is",
      "Benny Safdie\u2019s \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d isn\u2019t what you think it is, especially if you think it\u2019s a movie about a British guy who thinks his typewriter is the tops.",
      "\u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d would seem to bear all the hallmarks of something grittier, darker and more disturbing than it is. It\u2019s the solo directorial debut of the younger Safdie, whose films with his brother, Josh, have rarely not sprinted headlong into unsettling tumult. Add that sensibility to a true-life tale of a mixed martial arts fighter in the late \u201990s, and it\u2019s only natural to spend much of \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d bracing for tragedy, for some ear-splitting descent into macho calamity.",
      "Yet \u201cThe Smashing Machine,\u201d starring Dwayne Johnson as MMA pioneer Mark Kerr, is something simpler and less curious. A lack of probing was never anything you could accuse a Safdie brothers\u2019 movie of; these are the filmmakers who plunged a camera into the body cavity of a jewelry-store owner in \u201cUncut Gems.\u201d But, despite its grainy, VHS aesthetics, \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d is a surprisingly conventional and oddly untroubled movie, albeit one that gives Johnson an indie-film platform for one of his finest performances.",
      "As Mark, Johnson has drained away much of his big-screen charisma. The part \u2014 brawny, often shirtless, frequently raging in the ring \u2014 is immediately so close to Johnson\u2019s own professional wrestling background that early scenes look almost documentary-like. But gone is the megawatt grin and the dashing eyebrow lift. Johnson\u2019s normally polished bald head is here covered with a closely cropped dark head of hair.",
      "In the movie\u2019s opening, Mark rhapsodizes about his feeling of domination. An opponent\u2019s fear, he says, you can \u201csmell in their scent.\u201d At this point, Mark has known only victory in thumping triumphs that leave him feeling like a god. Losing, he confesses, is unfathomable.",
      "The laws of moviedom decree, of course, that Mark will soon lose, and his well-earned sense of invincibility will shatter. \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d bounces between Mark\u2019s home and Japan, where the Pride Fighting Championship takes place. That\u2019s where Mark, a much-celebrated champion, is taken down by an illegal but nevertheless humbling move. After the fact, the match is ruled a tie, but the stink of defeat never dissipates.",
      "The real battle, in any case, is at home. Mark\u2019s dependence on opioids for the punishing extremes he endures is becoming desperate. \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d is based on John Hyams\u2019s 2002 documentary of the same name, and part of the nature of that film was the curiosity of Mark\u2019s extreme violence in the ring and his otherwise sweet passivity. In Safdie\u2019s film, Mark is asked in the doctor\u2019s waiting room if fighters hate each other during a bout. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d he replies.",
      "But while we don\u2019t doubt Mark\u2019s sincerity \u2014 he\u2019s as earnest as he is muscle-bound \u2014 Johnson also exudes an inner turmoil, and a struggle to keep his rage at bay while nursing mounting wounds to his ego. His body is so stiff, it\u2019s like he could snap at any moment.",

When he tries to give up opioids, he takes her late-night drinking as a provocation. \u201cTreat me like a man,\u201d he tells her.",
      "It\u2019s an awkward, perhaps judgmental characterization that would be all the more glaring if it weren\u2019t for Blunt\u2019s tact as a performer. But it throws \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d off course, especially when the movie seems to want to lean more on its other central relationship: that of Mark and his friend, trainer and sometimes competitor Mark Coleman (played by former Bellator champion Ryan Bader).",
      "In his films with his brother, Safdie has long brought real-life figures into their movie worlds, blurring fictional boundaries. Bader gives \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d a dose of documentary in his presence, but I\u2019d argue that Johnson\u2019s proximity to this world gives the movie its most compelling real-life echoes.",
      "I happen to think Johnson is also very good in full movie-star mode, especially when he has the chance to wryly undercut his big-screen presence in comedies like \u201cJumanji: Welcome to the Jungle\u201d or \u201cThe Tooth Fairy.\u201d But it\u2019s also captivating to see him so thoroughly settled into a character like he is in \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d while totally shorn of his charisma.",
      "Yet the potency of that performance is let down by a movie that fails to really grapple with the violent world around Mark, resorting instead for a blander appreciation of these MMA combatants. What does resonate, though, is the portrait of a human colossus who learns to accept defeat \u2014 a mountain of a man who looks like he could, without barely trying, rip someone\u2019s head off at any moment. Instead he takes a deep breath, and doesn\u2019t.",

      "NEW YORK -- In 1983, six thieves muscled their way into a warehouse near Heathrow Airport, expecting to find a large sum of foreign currency. They got much more than they bargained for \u2014 26 million pounds worth of gold bars.",
      "What happened in the days and years next is the subject of PBS\u2019 \u201cMasterpiece\u201d enthralling series \u201cThe Gold,\u201d which traces the ripple effects of Britain's biggest robbery, going from a local search to infiltrating an international money laundering cartel. It starts airing Sunday.",
      "\u201cFrom the minute the show starts, the pressure's on,\u201d says showrunner Neil Forsyth. \u201cThere\u2019s a clock ticking, there\u2019s a net tightening and all these things. So it\u2019s lovely to write characters under that continual pressure.\u201d",
      "The so-called Brinks-Mat heist rocked Britain, leading to changes in banking laws, policing and shining a light on official corruption. Much of the gold was never located. It was melted down and sold back into the financial system, with the proceeds laundered into real estate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s literally in the bricks and mortar and the architecture that surrounds people everywhere,\u201d says Emun Elliott, who plays one of the detectives. \u201cThere might be a piece of that stolen gold in your wedding ring. It is everywhere.\u201d",
      "To tell the sprawling story of \u201cThe Gold,\u201d Forsyth streamlined timelines, combined real-life figures and adjusted events to fit the drama. Viewers are told the series was \u201cinspired by real events.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a strict factual drama,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t find that a very attractive route to go down creatively because I like having the space to create and that\u2019s extremely important if you\u2019re going to create something that\u2019s truly entertaining, truly gripping.\u201d",
      "One real person who is portrayed in the series is Brian Boyce, the principled and determined lead investigator, played by \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d star Hugh Bonneville.",
      "Boyce \u201cwas known to be a safe pair of hands,\u201d says Bonneville, who met the retired officer to prepare for the role. Boyce knew some officers in the department were corrupt and picked a lean, insular team to track down the gold and money.",
      "\u201cHe absolutely was adamant that not on his watch would police corruption thrive,\u201d Bonneville says. \u201cHe\u2019s a real man of integrity and I think that comes through. You\u2019ve got him against all odds trying to steer a level course and get this job done.\u201d",
      "Forsyth says the series' first episode attracted some 10 million viewers in the U.K. \u2014 or 1 in 5 of the adult population. He says he was in a restaurant with his wife once when the nearby table spent the whole meal discussing it, which was \u201csomewhat unnerving.\u201d",
      "Forsyth was only 5 and living in Scotland at the time of what he calls the \u201ciconic heist.\u201d Despite its impact on British society, no one had pieced it all together in a dramatization or an all-encompassing documentary until now.",

      "It is often said of our greatest actors that they could compellingly recite the phone book.",
      "There's no doubt, just to continue that thought for a moment, that Daniel Day-Lewis is one of our greatest living actors \u2014 perhaps truly the best of them all. And so the first and most important thing to say about \u201cAnemone,\u201d a bleak, somber, absorbing but also sometimes frustratingly opaque collaboration with his director son Ronan, is that it's brought Day-Lewis back. He told us eight years ago that he was done with acting, and we hoped he was exaggerating. At least for now, it seems he was.",
      "As for the phone book: Well, there\u2019s a moment here where you might wish that was indeed the content you were hearing. In one of two remarkable monologues that punctuate a movie otherwise spare with words, Day-Lewis, playing a bitter and lonely recluse, lets loose an anecdote so shockingly scatological and epically disgusting \u2014 the script is co-written by father and son, by the way \u2014 that it\u2019s hard to erase from one\u2019s mind (still trying, here). Somehow, he makes it more fascinating than revolting \u2014 but it\u2019s a Herculean task, something Day-Lewis the actor is obviously no stranger to.",
      "The film's title refers to a flower that we briefly see growing in the lush woodlands where we find Day-Lewis\u2019 character, Ray, eking out the sparest of existences. The father-son writers take their time explaining why exactly Ray has consigned himself to this solitary life, but we get a key hint in the first frames of the film \u2014 violent kids\u2019 drawings, with stick figures carrying long guns, and severed limbs.",
      "We soon learn that both Ray and brother Jem (Sean Bean) were British soldiers, veterans of the early days of the Northern Ireland troubles. They're also victims of a violent childhood in care homes.",
      "But they haven't seen each other in two decades, their bond torn asunder by some unrevealed trauma that led them to each seek comfort \u2014 or absolution \u2014 in different places. Jem has found it in strict religious practice, and home life with Nessa, Ray's former partner, and Brian, their son.",
      "It is teenager Brian\u2019s deepening troubles that have spurred Jem to seek out his brother in the lush but forbidding woods, where Ray leads an ascetic life devoted to the most basic human survival. Ronan Day-Lewis, a painter making his feature directorial debut, is at his best in creating, along with cinematographer Ben Fordesman, a sense of the unpredictability of nature, culminating in a dramatic hailstorm.",

But the brothers connect, slowly, in mundane activities like brushing their teeth, swimming in the ocean, or dancing wildly together.",
      "The words do come tumbling when Ray relates his tale of how he wrought revenge upon a priest who repeatedly molested him as a child. This bracing monologue \u2014 in which he describes defecating on the man in sickening detail \u2014 is only a precursor to an extraordinary speech later in the film that is vintage Day-Lewis, a searing account of the life-altering moment he killed a young boy. \u201cI don\u2019t need your absolution,\u201d he snarls to his brother, when the latter tries to veer him away from the guilt and shame that have crippled him for 20 years.",
      "But clearly Ray does need some sort of absolution, and his confession to his brother is that first step.",

      "But the big-screen absence of the actor many would peg as the greatest one alive ends with \u201cAnemone,\u201d a new film directed by his son, Ronan Day-Lewis. The two of them wrote it together. What began as something small, with no real ambition, grew until a full feature film and Day-Lewis\u2019 long-awaited return to movies.",
      "\u201cIt saddened me that I had perhaps ruled myself out of that when I decided to work on something else for a while,\u201d Day-Lewis said in an interview alongside his son. \u201cAs we progressed through it, and it seemed less and less possible to contain it, like two fellas in a shed, it began to alarm me slightly. I understood that this was going to involve the full paraphernalia of a film production, and that wasn\u2019t something I was eager to get back into.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut we just kept moving forward to see what would happen,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd this is what happened.\u201d",

It\u2019s a father-son story, though not an autobiographical one. Day-Lewis stars as Ray Stoker, a solitary hermit living in a remote cabin. His brother, Jem (Sean Bean), arrives and tries to convince him to return to his teenage son.",
      "Since 2017\u2019s \u201cPhantom Thread,\u201d Day-Lewis has, among other things, studied violin making in Boston. But he has also come to think of his declaration of retirement as a mistake, or not quite what he intended. At least, it wasn\u2019t enough to stand in the way of him making a movie with his son.",
      "\u201cI know it\u2019s been imagined on my behalf by numerous commentators, people that don\u2019t know me, that somehow the way I work has left me so debilitated I can barely open my eyes in the morning. This then requires a period of five or six years recovery!\u201d Day-Lewis says. \u201cThat was never the case. The work itself was always nourishing to me.\u201d",
      "Yet after making \u201cPhantom Thread,\u201d Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s London-set portrait of a perfectionist couturier, Day-Lewis was uncertain that he would ever regenerate the appetite to tackle another role.",

And it\u2019s something I never found a solution to from the day I started doing this work until now. The public aspect of my life I\u2019ve always been baffled by.\u201d",
      "The most meaningful gesture Day-Lewis is offering his son might not be making a movie with him, but returning to the spotlight for it. At the New York Film Festival, Day-Lewis has been a happy, humble presence, calling himself a fool for his professed retirement and dutifully accepting a glare of attention that he\u2019s largely avoided for the last decade.",

      "\u201cThat\u2019s something that\u2019s weighed heavily over the years, this sort of misconception which has now become so ludicrous about Method acting, which is a very bad name in the business now,\u201d says Day-Lewis. \u201cWe all find a different way of approaching the same problems. And when we\u2019re on the set, it makes no goddamn difference what system you train under, Meisner or Method or Stanislavski or whatever it might be. You\u2019re just there trying to live in those moments, to burn yourself up trying to find that truth as well as you can.\u201d",

He\u2019s one of two sons Day-Lewis has with his wife, filmmaker Rebecca Miller. (He also has an older son, Gabriel-Kane Day-Lewis, from his past relationship with Isabelle Adjani.) From a young age, Day-Lewis saw how invested his son was in creating imagery. Ronan, meanwhile, grew up marveling from a distance at his father\u2019s work.",
      "\u201cIt always held a huge amount of mystery to me what he was doing,\u201d says Ronan, who has vivid memories of being on set for films like \u201cThere Will Be Blood\u201d and \u201cThe Ballad of Jack and Rose.\u201d \u201cTo be inside this realm that I had always been watching curiously from the outside was so intriguing. But there were aspects of his process that still remained a mystery to me, which I think helped, actually.\u201d",
      "For Day-Lewis, building the character of Ray was a step-by-step process that included everything in his woodland world, right down to the expired tin cans of sardines that line his shelves. (\u201cThere were never enough sardines for me,\u201d he says, smiling.) \u201cAnemone\u201d unfolds in fits and starts, with several glorious, improvised monologues surrounded with strikingly lush imagery by Ronan. Day-Lewis so relishes pushing the boundaries of such a fictional world that, once in it, he tends to not want to let go.",
      "\u201cYou hope to create a world, an illusion. And when somebody says to you, \u2018That was the last shot. Go home now,\u2019 that was so bewildering to me because I\u2019m still invested in that world,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not I have trouble letting go of it. The trouble I have is that I want to still splash around in that illusion.\u201d",
      "Still, it seems Day-Lewis has in \u201cAnemone\u201d avoided the kind of post-film feeling that followed \u201cPhantom Thread.\u201d The actor hasn\u2019t yet announced a forthcoming project, but he acknowledges feeling the capacity for more. While he doesn\u2019t say he missed acting during the last eight years, he appears to have come to some self-acceptance of its fundamental, irrevocable place in his life.",
      "\u201cIt has been my primary form of self-expression for my entire life, since I was a child,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd therefore, I don\u2019t know if I experience it as a sense of missing if I\u2019m not doing it. But the need to express myself in that way, even at a subterranean level, that is still there.\u201d",
      "But just as it\u2019s time to go, Day-Lewis offers \u201can appendix\u201d to his answer. If \u201cAnemone\u201d has left him still hungry for more, that fact is owed partly to the nature of its making. Not just that it was done with Ronan, but that they made it, themselves. It\u2019s Day-Lewis\u2019 first screenwriting credit.",
      "\u201cAnd that\u2019s a completely new experience for me,\u201d he says. \u201cI never really dared attempt to write before, so it\u2019s a new thing. You can begin with absolutely nothing and the hunger can grow out of that.\u201d",

      "Instead, it\u2019s a loose assembly of biography, reflection and key moments of political awakening, with actor Damian Lewis narrating Orwell\u2019s words with a poetic gravitas, interspersed with a collage of images, words and archival footage. Anything from David Lean\u2019s \u201cOliver Twist\u201d and Sydney Pollack \u201cOut of Africa\u201d to Lauren Greenfield\u2019s \u201cGeneration Wealth\u201d is on the table, and nothing is there carelessly. Alexei Aigui\u2019s powerful score adds a melancholy weight to sequences showing wartime destruction past and present along with the political phrases used to describe them: A \u201cstrategic bombing\u201d in Berlin in 1945, \u201cpeacekeeping operations\u201d in Mariupol in 2022, \u201cclearance operation\u201d in Myanmar in 2017.",
      "There\u2019s a purposefully disorienting effect to the film\u2019s editing, blending past, present, fiction and reality in such a way that it all begins to blur together. By the time we\u2019re hearing Lewis utter Orwell\u2019s famous phrase \u201cthe very concept of objective truth is fading out of the world\u201d while AI images pollute the screen, it\u2019s easy to forget that the quote is seven decades old. It won\u2019t prepare you for any kind of historical report on Orwell, totalitarianism or doublespeak, but its impact is undeniable.",
      "Orwell understood that every writer is a product of their own time. Born Eric Arthur Blair in Motihari, Bihar, then an outpost of the British Empire, Peck focuses in on a photograph of him as a baby with his Indian nursemaid. Describing himself as \u201clower upper middle class,\u201d Orwell attended Eton and served with the British Imperial Police in Burma (now Myanmar) and observed how power manifested in colonial outposts, how class unattainable in England was suddenly accessible to any white man simply because they were white. He considered himself both a snob and a revolutionary, which only intensified as he picked up more life experiences through the Spanish Civil War, his time at the BBC and simply observing ordinary people around him. It\u2019s actually quite extraordinary just how much information Peck, who has delved into the lives of James Baldwin, Karl Marx, Patrice Lumumba and Ernest Cole, is able to convey in just under two hours.",

      "The 27-year-old rapper, whose songs and videos have millions of YouTube views and Spotify streams, was among those arrested in connection with a long-term investigation into gang-related shootings in Brooklyn.

Sheff G even treated gang members to a lavish dinner at a Manhattan steakhouse to celebrate a 2020 shooting that killed a purported rival gang member and injured five others, according to prosecutors.",

      "Police video obtained by The Associated Press shows country music star Morgan Wallen denied throwing a chair off a Nashville bar roof before and after his 2024 arrest",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Country music star Morgan Wallen denied to police that he threw a chair off a Nashville honky-tonk bar roof before and after he was arrested and charged with reckless endangerment in 2024, police video obtained by The Associated Press shows.",
      "Roughly two weeks after his April 2024 arrest, Wallen commented on social media: \u201cI'm not proud of my behavior, and I accept responsibility\u201d and said he \u201cmade amends\u201d with Nashville law enforcement and others. Then in December, he pleaded guilty to two counts.",
      "The Metro Nashville Police Department released the footage of Wallen\u2019s arrest, captured by several officers' body and cruiser cameras, in response to a public records request from the AP. A previously released arrest affidavit did not get into the details of what Wallen told officers.",
      "A police car camera shows two officers, who were standing outside, react to something apparently falling from above on a late Sunday night. And one officer\u2019s body camera video begins with a shot of a broken chair in the road near his parked police cruiser, close to Chief\u2019s on Broadway, in the city's entertainment district.",
      "Then, as Wallen and his bodyguard team come down to the main entrance on Broadway, one of the men with Wallen is shouting, \u201cHe didn\u2019t see anything. You don\u2019t have witnesses, you are accusing!\u201d",
      "\u201cHe didn\u2019t throw nothing, he didn\u2019t throw nothing,\u201d the bodyguard continues, and accuses two bar workers of \u201cbeing aggressive.\u201d",
      "When an officer asks Wallen what happened, the musician replies, \u201cI don't know.\u201d",
      "He later tells another officer, \u201cWe\u2019ve not tried to cause no problems, man. I don\u2019t know what they are \u2014 I don\u2019t know why.\u201d",
      "That officer said police were figuring out what happened after a chair came flying off the roof and landed by his patrol car. Wallen replied, \u201cAs you should.\u201d",
      "At one point, Wallen is on his cellphone, then points it at the officer and says, \u201cEric Church is on the phone.\u201d Church, another country star, co-owns Chief's. During the call, Wallen had used an expletive to describe the officers he said were \u201ctrying to take me to jail outside of your (expletive) bar.\u201d",
      "Church, who can't be heard on the police recording, recommended to the officer that Wallen wait in a private space instead of standing on the public sidewalk, said a representative for Church.",
      "The officer responds: \u201cIt\u2019s not really something we can do. Law enforcement have to enforce the laws. Figure out what happened. We\u2019ve got a supervisor coming to the scene. Gotta treat it like we would with anybody else.\u201d",
      "Representatives for Wallen did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Back in the bar, police were in an office watching security footage from the roof, body camera footage shows. The security video was not clear from the officers' body cameras and a police spokesperson said there was no security camera footage from the bar in the case files.",
      "The officers return outside and a sergeant, who says he watched security video of Wallen throwing a chair off the roof, handcuffs him.",
      "Another officer talks to two witnesses. One, referring to the chair, says she saw Wallen \u201clift it up and throw it off\u201d and laugh.",

      "Bad Bunny captivated audiences with his residency in Puerto Rico, inspiring patriotism and drawing half a million people to the island this summer",
      "NEW YORK -- Crowds wore maga flowers and \u201cpavas\u201d \u2014 straw hats traditionally worn by j\u00edbaros, Puerto Rican rural farmers. They drank Medalla beer and danced salsa.",
      "Over the course of a 31-date residency at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico in San Juan, Bad Bunny worked a miracle, inspiring patriotism in the hearts of a proud Boricua people, and in those traveling to Puerto Rico for the first time. He performed on two stages, one showcasing the island's natural beauty with its flamboyan and plantain trees, and another, a casita (\u201clittle house\u201d), for the pari de marquesina, a house party.",
      "If all the world's a stage \u2014 might as well make it home.",
      "In February, it can be expected that the artist born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio will bring the same spirit to the 2026 Super Bowl. And he'll do so in Spanish \u2014 a landmark moment for Latino culture.",
      "Bad Bunny's \u201cNo Me Quiero Ir De Aqu\u00ed\u201d residency (in English, \u201cI Don\u2019t Want to Leave Here\u201d) bypassed a traditional U.S. tour, bringing approximately half a million people to the island during the slow summer tourism season and generating an estimated $733 million for Puerto Rico. Across three hours, attendees were guided through a musical history \u2014 reggaet\u00f3n hits from Bad Bunny's singular discography as well as the folkloric styles of his latest album, \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos.\u201d (\u201cI Should Have Taken More Photos.\")",
      "There was a political history, too: like in the affecting song \u201cLo Que Pas\u00f3 a Hawaii,\u201d (\u201cWhat Happened to Hawaii\u201d), a rallying cry for Puerto Rico's autonomy. Or 2022's \u201cEl Apag\u00f3n\u201d (\u201cThe Blackout\u201d), in reference to Hurricane Maria, its aftermath and the continued anger and frustration over persistent, chronic power outages.",
      "Of course, a Super Bowl halftime show traditionally runs 12 to 15 minutes. It's not a lot of time to bring Puerto Rico, or its complicated colonial history, to the NFL's mainstream \u2014 but it is enough for a taste.",
      "It's worth mentioning Benito has done so before: making a surprise appearance at the Super Bowl in 2020, during Shakira and Jennifer Lopez's performance. He sang in Spanish alongside two artists whose bilingual hits helped usher in a crossover era for Latin music in the \u201800s. He\u2019s a direct inheritor of their successes, and he's been able to kick the door down further \u2014 helping to establish an industry where Latino superstars need not record their music in English to have a career.",
      "Bad Bunny is simultaneously an interesting and an obvious choice for the NFL: One of the most popular artists on the planet who understands that going global means embracing the local, performing during the most-watched television program of the year.",
      "In a recent interview with i-D Magazine, Bad Bunny mentioned that one of the reasons his residency bypassed the continental U.S. were concerns around the mass deportations of Latinos.",
      "\u201cThere was the issue of \u2014 like, (expletive) ICE could be outside (my concert). And it\u2019s something that we were talking about and very concerned about,\u201d he told the publication, referencing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ( Hundreds of people have been detained in Puerto Rico since large-scale arrests began in late January, surprising many in the U.S. territory that has long welcomed migrants.) It resonated with Latinos and the Spanish speaking community, who have grown increasingly weary amid growing anti-immigrant sentiment and raids, as President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies and executive actions have vastly expanded who is eligible for deportation.",
      "Bad Bunny has long been critical of Trump and backed Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. \u201cI will never forget what Donald Trump did and what he did not do when Puerto Rico needed a caring and a competent leader,\u201d he said in a video last year.",
      "For some Trump supporters, Bad Bunny's booking at the 2026 Super Bowl is a divisive political pick. Conservative commentator Benny Johnson described Bad Bunny as an \u201canti-ICE activist\" on Instagram.",

      "At the very least, Bad Bunny, who performs in Spanish and will do so at the Super Bowl, is set to make history, further proving that connecting with a U.S. and international audience does not require singing in English.",
      "The question is \u2014 what messages will Bad Bunny deliver in a culture where identity is politicized? And what does it mean that his performance arrives in the midst of one of the largest immigration crackdowns in U.S. history, where Latinos are especially vulnerable?",
      "In February, Kendrick Lamar's 2025 Super Bowl halftime performance made art of his short set, offering a meta commentary on race and America. \u201cThe revolution \u2019bout to be televised,\u201d he announced early in the performance.",
      "It featured actor Samuel L. Jackson as Uncle Sam, whose character critiqued the rapper and his dancers dressed in red, white and blue for being \u201ctoo loud, too reckless, too ghetto,\u201d reminding them to \u201cplay the game.\u201d There was the sense that Lamar was breaking the fourth wall, reminding viewers of the NFL's political associations following Colin Kaepernick\u2019s kneeling protests and the Black Lives Matter movement.",
      "That Lamar was able to weave American themes into his history-making performance as the first solo hip-hop artist to ever headline the coveted slot will no doubt benefit Bad Bunny. At the very least, he may learn from the rapper's layered and conceptual narratives, that messages on the NFL stage do not need to be explicit to be effective.",
      "At every date of his residency, Bad Bunny invited celebrities \u2014 among them LeBron James, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 \u2014 to join in his party. He also performed with many musicians, including Puerto Rico heavyweights Jowell y Randy, Arc\u00e1ngel and notably Marc Anthony. The pair duetted \u201cPreciosa,\u201d which is viewed as one of Puerto Rico\u2019s unofficial anthems.",
      "Written by Puerto Rican composer Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez Mar\u00edn in 1937, \u201cPreciosa\u201d references Puerto Rico\u2019s hybrid identity \u2014 a mix of Spanish, African and the indigenous Taino cultures \u2014 and threats made to the island in its long colonial history. (\u201cNo importa el tirano te trate con negra maldad,\u201d goes the chorus. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter that the tyrant treats you with black hatred.\u201d) It also arrived shortly after the 1937 Ponce massacre, in which a peaceful march organized by the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party ended in a police shooting where 19 died and 200 were injured.",
      "It's common for Super Bowl halftime performances to bring surprise guests into their sets \u2014 and no doubt Bad Bunny will do the same \u2014 but who he chooses will wait to be seen. If he pulls from the book of Lamar, any collaboration may have veiled political weight \u2014 informed by his residency, but softened for the NFL crowd.",

      "New rules that limit the access of journalists in the Pentagon and appear to condition entry into the building on agreement to restrictions have led to a standoff between the press and the Trump administration's defense department",
      "Journalists who cover the Pentagon and the Trump admnistration are in a standoff about new rules that limit the access of the media to most areas within the Pentagon and appear to condition overall entry to the building on an agreement to restrictions in reporting.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's team characterizes the changes as an effort to protect national security and the safety of those who work at the Pentagon, while many in the press see it as an effort to exert control and avoid embarrassing stories.",
      "Journalists who want to hold on to badges that permit access to the Pentagon were told on Sept. 19 they must sign a letter acknowledging the new rules by this Tuesday or the badge \u201cwill be revoked.\u201d The new policy says that Defense Department information \u201cmust be approved for public release by an appropriate authorizing official before it is released, even if unclassified.\u201d Classified material faces even tighter restrictions.",
      "That level of control immediately alarmed journalists and their advocates.",
      "\u201cAsking independent journalists to submit to these kinds of restrictions is at stark odds with the constitutional protections of a free press in a democracy, and a continued attempt to throttle the public's right to understand what their government is doing,\u201d said Charles Stadtlander, spokesman for The New York Times.",
      "In a subsequent letter to the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, Hegseth aide Sean Parnell suggested that journalists misunderstood some of the new rules. He said, for example, that the restriction against releasing unclassified information is the policy that Pentagon officials must follow \u2014 not something the journalists must abide by.",
      "\u201cIt should come as no surprise that the mainstream media is once again misrepresenting the Pentagon's press procedures,\u201d Parnell said in a post on X. \u201cLet's be absolutely clear: Journalists are not required to clear their stories with us. That claim is a lie.\u201d",
      "However, the new policy says that journalists who encourage Pentagon officials to break the rules \u2014 in other words, ask sources for information \u2014 could be subject to losing their building access.",
      "While it appeared that Parnell sought to soften some of the hard edges of his policy in response to questions raised by the reporters' committee, there's still enough confusion to merit a meeting to clear things up, said Grayson Clary, a lawyer for RCFP. There's some wariness among news organizations about what they would be agreeing to if they sign the letter, and it's not clear how many people \u2014 if any \u2014 have done so.",
      "The new rules continue a tense relationship between the press and the Hegseth team, which had already evicted some news outlets from their regular workspaces in favor of friendlier outlets and limited the ability of reporters to roam around the Pentagon. Hegseth and Parnell seldom hold press briefings.",
      "Parnell did not respond to a request for comment by The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cIt's control, just 100% control,\u201d said Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine. Goldberg, who is not stationed at the Pentagon, wrote the most embarrassing story of Hegseth's tenure so far when he was inadvertently included in a Signal group chat where Hegseth and other national officials discussed an imminent attack on Houthis in Yemen. The brouhaha became widely known as \u201cSignalgate.\u201d",
      "Pentagon leadership was also reportedly unhappy over a story that said Elon Musk was to get a briefing on military strategy for China, leading President Donald Trump to stop it, and other stories about initial assessments of damage in the military strike against Iran.",
      "No American reporter accredited to the Pentagon that he knows is interested in subverting national security or putting anyone in the military in harm's way, Goldberg said.",
      "In his own case, Goldberg did not report on what he learned until after the attack was over. He said he contacted officials in the group chat to ask if there was anything he learned that was harmful to the country in any way. He did not include in his story the name of a CIA official mentioned in the messages who was technically still undercover, he said.",
      "\u201cThe only people in Signalgate who were putting American troops in harm's way were the national leadership of the United States by discussing on a commercial messaging app the launch times of strikes on a hostile country,\u201d he said.",

With the exception of a few areas, reporters are not permitted under the new rules to walk through the Pentagon without an official escort.",
      "Priest said the corridors of the Pentagon were like areas around Congress where reporters buttonhole politicians. Priest recalled staking out military officials waiting for them to come out of a bathroom.",
      "\u201cThey know the goal of the media is to get around the official gobbledygook and get out the truth,\u201d Priest said. \u201cThey may not help you. But some of them want to help Americans know what is going on.\u201d",

      "Bad Bunny has been chosen to headline the Super Bowl halftime show, marking a significant moment for Latin identity on a major stage",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The selection of Bad Bunny to headline the Super Bowl halftime show is about more than music.",
      "The move signals a cultural spotlight for Latin identity at America\u2019s most-watched television event. It also raises fresh questions about how much space there will be for his trademark symbolism and social commentary \u2014 including his past criticism of President Donald Trump \u2014 given the NFL's history of keeping performances tightly managed.",
      "Here are some things to know about the selection.",
      "The halftime show is a collaboration between the NFL, Roc Nation and Apple Music.",
      "Roc Nation, Jay-Z\u2019s entertainment company, has curated performers since 2019 and returns alongside veteran producer Jesse Collins. Apple Music distributes the performance, while the NFL ultimately controls the stage, broadcast and branding.",
      "Artists don\u2019t get a paycheck for performing. However, their payoff is global exposure. That imbalance gives the league leverage, though history shows that high-powered stars sometimes defy the league\u2019s guardrails.",
      "The NFL has a track record of pushing back when artists get political. However, some performers don't always comply.",
      "\u2022 In 2020, the league asked Jennifer Lopez to cut a segment featuring children in cages, a critique of U.S. immigration policies. She refused.",
      "\u2022 In 2022, it was reported that Dr. Dre and Eminem were both advised not to kneel or reference police, but they went forward.",
      "\u2022 Rapper M.I.A. flashed a middle finger during Madonna\u2019s set, earning a hefty fine in 2012. She and the NFL ultimately reached a settlement ending their multimillion dollar dispute a couple years later.",
      "While Bad Bunny is a known hitmaker, he\u2019s also an artist who ties his music to Puerto Rican identity, colonial politics and immigrant struggles. His Super Bowl announcement included a pointed dedication: \u201cThis is for my people, my culture, and our history.\u201d",
      "That alone sets the stage for a performance that could carry layered meanings far beyond spectacle.",
      "In his career, Bad Bunny has become one of the world\u2019s most streamed artists with albums such as \u201cUn Verano Sin Ti,\u201d an all-Spanish-language record.",
      "The 31-year-old artist born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio has won three Grammys and 12 Latin Grammys. He has become a global ambassador for Latin music, starred in films such as \u201cBullet Train,\u201d \u201cCaught Stealing\u201d and \u201cHappy Gilmore 2,\u201d and collaborated with top fashion houses. He enters November's Latin Grammys as the leading nominee with 12, dethroning producer and songwriter \u00c9dgar Barrera.",
      "Bad Bunny has been vocal in his opposition to Trump and his policies. In the final weeks of the 2024 campaign, he backed former Vice President Kamala Harris after a comedian at Trump\u2019s Madison Square Garden rally mocked Puerto Rico as a \u201cfloating island of garbage.\u201d",
      "Days later, Bad Bunny posted a video showcasing Puerto Rico\u2019s beaches and artists, captioned simply: \u201cgarbage.\u201d",
      "Since Trump took office, Bad Bunny's criticism hasn\u2019t slowed. This year, he shared an Instagram video appearing to show immigration agents making arrests in Puerto Rico, with the voice behind the camera cursing the agents.",

He\u2019s pushed for the late Pete Rose\u2019s Hall of Fame induction, threatened to block Washington\u2019s new stadium deal if the team didn\u2019t restore its old name, and frequently used sporting events as political platforms.",
      "The moves are part of his broader efforts to shape the country\u2019s cultural mood, weighing in on entertainers and companies alike. He blasted late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, whose show briefly faced suspension after the Trump administration signaled potential repercussions following remarks in the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk\u2019s assassination.",

      "And just last month, Trump inserted himself into the backlash over Cracker Barrel\u2019s new logo, posting on Truth Social that the company should stick with its old design. When the chain reversed course, he celebrated the decision as a personal victory.",
      "For Bad Bunny, the halftime show is the ultimate stage to showcase his music, heritage and global influence. For the NFL and Apple Music, it\u2019s a balancing act: deliver a spectacle that celebrates diversity without igniting controversy that scares off advertisers.",
      "If Bad Bunny leans strictly into spectacle, the moment could be historic for Latin music. If he threads in political symbolism, it could become one of the most dissected halftime performances in Super Bowl history.",

      "Edilson Trindade, the manager who has worked at the bar since 2018, told The Associated Press the establishment usually sells about 80 caipirinhas \u2014 Brazil\u2019s national cocktail made with cacha\u00e7a, lime, sugar and ice \u2014 each night. Last week, he didn\u2019t sell a single one. No other cocktails were ordered, either.",
      "\u201cClients have been worried, and we\u2019re advising them it\u2019s better not to drink cocktails,\u201d Trindade said.",
      "His concern reflects a nationwide unease over distilled beverages following a surge in methanol poisoning cases that has prompted police investigations, stoked public fear and altered drinking habits in recent days.",
      "The Health Ministry said Friday it had confirmed 11 cases tied to alcoholic beverages and was investigating 102 suspected cases. One death was confirmed through lab tests in Sao Paulo, with eleven others under investigation.",
      "Nearly all the cases have been reported in Sao Paulo, the country's most populous state and the epicenter of the outbreak.",
      "Last week, local media reported deaths and hospitalizations linked to methanol-tainted alcohol. Some patients were admitted to intensive care with severe symptoms, including blindness.",
      "One of them was the rapper Hungria, who has been hospitalized in Brasilia after possibly drinking altered alcohol. On Friday, he posted on his Instagram account that he was feeling better and would soon be discharged.",
      "\"Friday has a different energy. If you feel thirsty, find a safe place to have a drink,\" the singer said.",
      "Health Minister Alexandre Padilha urged Brazilians to avoid drinking, especially distilled beverages, which are more difficult to verify for adulteration. He described the situation as abnormal and noted that Brazil recorded 20 methanol poisoning cases in August and September, equal to its annual average.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s completely wrong,\u201d said Samantha Whiten, a clinical psychologist in Maryland. \u201cAll it does is make sure that people are fighting when they\u2019re tired.\u201d",
      "Instead, couples can learn habits that help them get rest while boosting the relationship long term.",
      "It\u2019s understandable to want to discuss a problem before letting it fester, Whiten said, but it\u2019s unrealistic to expect conflicts to be wrapped up quickly and lovingly before drifting off to sleep.",
      "\u201cThat sounds nice,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s like a fairy tale, though.\u201d",

      "A nonprofit group in Miami is helping reduce the strain on emergency rooms by providing homeless people with health care where they live",
      "MIAMI -- MIAMI (AP) \u2014 Jonas Richards became homeless several years ago after losing his job as a truck driver. Despite suffering from high blood pressure and diabetes, seeing a doctor hasn't been a major priority since then.",
      "\u201cWhen you're homeless, it's not easy,\u201d Richards said. \u201cYou find yourself hustling, trying to keep a little money in your pocket, trying to find something to eat.\u201d",
      "But Richards recently had his first visit with doctors from Miami Street Medicine while sitting on a curb outside a homeless shelter.",
      "\u201cYou get everything done right here very fast,\u201d Richards said. \u201cIt was a big help.\u201d",
      "Miami Street Medicine is a nonprofit organization providing free mobile health care services to homeless people. It\u2019s part of a larger group, Dade County Street Response, which also includes a free clinic called Doctors Within Borders, a disaster relief team and a mental health crisis line.",
      "Miami Street Medicine teams of paid staff and medical school student volunteers aren\u2019t just bandaging cuts and handing out aspirin. They\u2019re performing intake on patients with tablet computers and offer follow-up visits for chronic conditions. They're working with specialists like dermatologists, neurologists and cardiologists.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re out there to meet the needs of our patients,\u201d founder Dr. Dan Bergholz said. \u201cAnd if that\u2019s a cough drop, we\u2019ve got you. We are happy to help you with that cough drop. But really the mission is so much greater. It\u2019s showing that we care, and we\u2019re there for them. So when that cough becomes pneumonia, they\u2019ll let us listen to their lungs and maybe trust us to take them to the hospital.\u201d",
      "Bergholz began laying groundwork for Miami Street Medicine about seven years ago. He said he had started doing charity outreach with homeless people as an undergraduate, but it seemed like more could be done.",
      "\u201cIt just felt like we weren\u2019t quite moving the needle for folks,\u201d Bergholz said.",
      "After learning more about the growing trend of street medicine and being accepted to the University of Miami\u2019s medical school, Bergholz began working with other students to set up a program.",
      "\u201cI moved down to Miami early and just started hitting the streets and chatting with people,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could call it a needs assessment.\u201d",
      "Just as Miami Street Medicine was taking off, the COVID-19 pandemic hit and forced the group to adjust. Bergholz connected with Dade County Street Response to provide health care to more underserved areas.",

      "\u201cA sort of bigger vision emerged to fill the gaps in the local social safety net,\u201d Bergholz said.",
      "One challenge is the transient nature of homeless people, which makes it difficult to provide continual care. Dr. Armen Henderson, founder of Dade County Street Response, said the problem is compounded by laws that target homeless people.",
      "\u201cThe criminalization of homelessness has significantly impacted our patients\u2019 ability to be in one place to get services,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cFor the street medicine team, they know they meet us in one place. But if the majority of those patients are now ending up in jail, now the people are trying to figure out what places are police not harassing them.\u201d",
      "Another challenge is fighting the common sentiment that providing services actually increases homelessness, Henderson said.",
      "\u201cThe only thing that ends homelessness is easy access to housing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that encourages people to be unsheltered. No one wants to be unsheltered. So by offering services like this, we\u2019re actually trying to ease people\u2019s suffering. When people come in here, they want to get off the street. They want to figure out a plan.\u201d",
      "Members of Miami Street Medicine have noticed more people losing their homes in recent years as prices increase and wages remain stagnant. Dr. Inaki Bent, who oversees street medicine teams, said he\u2019s also seen an increase in undocumented migrants on the streets as the state and federal governments have expanded immigration enforcement this year.",
      "\u201cI see patients here who are no longer working,\u201d Bent said. \u201cThey\u2019re no longer working because the fields and the construction sites have become targets. And they would prefer not to be employed or not to expose themselves to that risk.\u201d",
      "In addition to the individual benefit to patients, providing medical treatment on the street and at the group's clinic prevents treatable conditions from becoming emergencies that ultimately strain the entire health care system. For example, Bent had a patient who had previously been treated for seizures at an emergency room and received a prescription, but couldn't afford it. The patient would have eventually ended up back in the ER, but Miami Street Medicine paid for his medicine.",

      "New Mexico legislators moved quickly to prop up funding for food assistance and rural health care services in response to President Donald Trump\u2019s cuts in federal spending on Medicaid and nutrition programs",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) \u2014 New Mexico lawmakers moved quickly Thursday at a special legislative session to prop up funding for food assistance and rural health care services in response to President Donald Trump\u2019s cuts to federal spending on Medicaid and nutrition programs.",
      "The Democratic-led Legislature sent a flurry of bills to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham that include more than $16 million to sustain food assistance under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and additional funds to bolster food banks, as the federal government ends SNAP eligibility for many noncitizens and changes benefit calculations for others.",
      "\u201cWe need to act to make sure that New Mexicans don't go hungry with SNAP changes at the federal level,\u201d Democratic state Sen. George Mu\u00f1oz of Gallup said.",
      "Another $50 million would help sustain medical services at rural health clinics and hospitals that rely heavily on Medicaid spending.",
      "Republicans in the legislative minority voted in unison against the spending provisions, arguing big Medicaid changes are still far away and that New Mexico should focus on reducing errors in benefit distributions.",
      "At the same time, Democrats and some GOP legislators voted to backfill subsidies to health insurance on New Mexico\u2019s Affordable Health Care exchange in case federal credits are allowed to expire. The federal subsidies are a major sticking point of the budget standoff in Washington that prompted the federal government shutdown Wednesday.",
      "In a news release, Lujan Grisham said she'll sign the bills to protect families from being priced out of insurance and ensure health care services are provided in small communities.",
      "Many federal health care changes under Trump's big bill don\u2019t kick in until 2027 or later, and Democratic legislators in New Mexico acknowledged that their bills are only a temporary bandage.",
      "\u201cSome of the most significant (federal) cuts are delayed a few years, and these are deeply significant,\u201d said state Rep. Nathan Small of Las Cruces, lead sponsor of the spending bill. \u201cI want to make sure that we\u2019re all thinking of, not hundreds of millions, but billions of dollars of reduced Medicaid support to our state.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s big bill is prompting urgent action in several Democratic states, but not in Republican ones.",
      "\u201cThese are temporary fixes,\" Democratic state House Speaker Javier Mart\u00ednez said. \u201cThese are insurmountable holes for any state to plug.\u201d",
      "New Mexico lawmakers approved a quick infusion of state spending on food assistance through SNAP for elderly recipients.",
      "Nearly one-fourth of New Mexico residents receive food assistance through SNAP, making it a major line of defense against hunger.",

      "Trump\u2019s big bill sets aside $50 billion over five years for rural hospitals, providers and clinics \u2014 but that may not offset significant cuts.",
      "The stakes are high in New Mexico, where about 38% of residents rely on Medicaid. And state lawmakers \u2014 Republicans and Democrats \u2014 are warning of a rural health care crisis as New Mexico struggles to retain medical professionals and keep clinics and hospitals open.",
      "State Sen. Pat Woods, a Republican from the state\u2019s sparsely populated eastern plains, co-sponsored changes to rural health care grants aimed at shoring up existing health care services at rural clinics and hospitals. A 64-3 vote of the House on Thursday sent the bill to the governor for consideration.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to figure out a way to fund and keep some of these clinics open. What\u2019s going to happen in the future? Who the hell knows,\u201d Woods told a panel of state lawmakers. \u201cWhat I worry about is keeping these clinics and hospitals open until the dust settles.\u201d",
      "Legislators also voted to set aside $17 million to ensure subsidies don't lapse on New Mexico's Affordable Care Act exchange.",
      "That initiative also would extend insurance subsidies to middle-income residents whose earnings equal or exceed 400% of the federal poverty level \u2014 roughly $128,000 annually for a family of four.",
      "Democratic state Sen. Carrie Hamblen of Las Cruces said the insurance subsidies will help avoid a \u201cperfect storm of unaffordability,\" warning that rising insurance rates threaten to undermine participation in the exchange and make matters worse.",
      "Separately, legislators approved $6 million in state funding for public broadcasting stations \u2014 including $430,000 for five tribal stations hit hard by the defunding of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting by Congress and Trump. Approved federal grants to the stations for the current federal budget year were clawed back, under a bill signed by Trump in July.",
      "Another bill awaiting the governor's signature would give the New Mexico Health Department greater decision-making authority regarding adult and childhood immunizations and state vaccine purchases.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Federal officials have approved another generic version of the abortion pill mifepristone, a regulatory formality that quickly triggered pushback from anti-abortion groups and politicians aligned with the Trump administration.",
      "Drugmaker Evita Solutions announced on its website that the Food and Drug Administration signed off on its low-cost form of the pill, which is approved to end pregnancies through 10 weeks.",
      "Students for Life Action, which opposes abortion, in a statement Thursday called the approval \u201ca stain on the Trump presidency and another sign that the deep state at the FDA must go.\u201d",
      "Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri also criticized the move in a post on X, stating, \u201cI have lost confidence in the leadership at FDA.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the agency said the FDA \u201chas very limited discretion in deciding whether to approve a generic drug,\" and added that FDA officials do not \u201cendorse any product.\u201d",
      "The criticism comes as Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s top health officials, including Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., face growing pressure from abortion opponents to reevaluate mifepristone, which was approved 25 years ago and has repeatedly been deemed safe and effective by FDA scientists.",
      "In a letter to Republican attorneys general last month, Kennedy and FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary pledged to conduct a full review of the drug\u2019s safety.",
      "Under Makary and Kennedy, the FDA has repeatedly delayed decisions on vaccines, ultimately narrowing the terms of approval for this year's COVID-19 shots. That type of political intervention was previously highly unusual at the FDA, where career scientists typically make such decisions.",
      "The FDA approved the original version of mifepristone in 2000 and gradually eased access over time. That included approving the first generic pill, from drugmaker GenBioPro, in 2019.",
      "In 2021, the FDA under Democratic President Joe Biden permitted online prescribing and mail-order delivery of the drug, greatly expanding access. Abortion opponents have been fighting the change ever since.",
      "Approval of generic drugs is typically a rote process at the FDA, with multiple copycat versions usually approved after the patent on the original drug expires. In most cases, generic drugmakers only need to show that their drug matches the ingredients and formula used in the original medication.",
      "\u201cThis is exactly how our system is supposed to work, and it has worked this way for decades,\" said Mini Timmaraju of Reproductive Freedom for All. \u201cCareer scientists and civil servants at the FDA did their jobs.\u201d",

      "The idea of meditating can be intimidating to beginners",
      "NEW YORK -- The idea of meditating can be intimidating. Beginners may imagine sitting uncomfortably in silence while breathing deeply and scrubbing all thoughts from their minds. The prospect of trying those techniques at work may feel embarrassing.",
      "But there are ways to bring short, inconspicuous sessions into the workday if you want to see if meditation can help you deal with challenging customers or reduce anxiety while preparing for a presentation. And experienced practitioners say there's no right or wrong way to do it.",
      "\u201c Meditation is quite easy, as a matter of fact. I think there\u2019s a stigma around it, that you have to be in complete silence, and you have to have some room setup, or do some chanting, or some serious breathing,\u201d said Michelle Beyer, a wellness coach who owns the Brooklyn women\u2019s gym Alana Life & Fitness. \u201cThere\u2019s one-minute meditations you can do to make yourself feel great. Nobody will even know you\u2019re doing them.\"",
      "While there are different meditation techniques, many traditions encourage focusing on breathing to help calm the mind. When thoughts pop up, imagine letting them go. Practitioners say meditating before or at work helps them maintain focus, sit still and reduce stress.",
      "\u201cThere is a calm that I am definitely missing when I have forgotten to do it for a few days,\u201d said Brianna Healy, who meditates for 10 minutes daily before starting her job as assistant director of strategic initiatives and data solutions at Naropa University, a college in Boulder, Colorado, that is inspired by Buddhist principles. \u201cI can always tell the difference in my demeanor.\"",
      "If you feel pressed for time, try fitting meditation sessions into breaks. You can set a timer and focus on breathing while sitting at a desk, in a restroom, inside a vehicle or outside, Beyer said.",
      "Here are some easy mini-meditations to try out on the job.",
      "Commuters can consider getting to work a little early and taking a pause in their cars or a quiet location to decompress from getting out the door and to your destination, said Kathryn Remati, a meditation teacher and author of \u201cBefriend Yourself.\u201d If you only have a minute or two, that's still enough time to try Remati's instructions for a quick reset.",
      "Close your eyes and take a long, slow, deep breath to fill your tummy and lungs with air, she said. Hold the breath for a second, and then slowly breathe out like you're blowing out a candle. \"You\u2019ll immediately feel a shift and you\u2019ll feel like a human again,\u201d Remati said.",
      "While repeating that process, consider setting a positive intention, or goal, for the day. Instead of focusing on a to-do list, think about how you want behave towards others, she said. Some intention examples are, \u201cToday I\u2019m going to be productive, but I\u2019m also going to a good listener\u201d or \u201cI want to have a positive attitude,\u201d she said.",
      "Visualization is another technique that experienced meditators use. Picture yourself succeeding at the challenges you\u2019ll encounter that day. If there\u2019s an upcoming deadline, envision yourself finishing the task 10 minutes early. Jumping for joy. Get specific like a movie director and imagine the colors in the room or the feeling of wind on your face, Remati said.",
      "Throughout the day, \u201cyou can bring up that image anytime you need it to refocus,\u201d she said.",
      "You can also use visualization to reframe your perspective on colleagues or clients. A technique Remati recommends putting into practice before meetings may seem quirky: Envision a white light over the meeting room's doorway that showers the people entering with brightness. Remati says it may help you imagine them in a better light. \u201cYou can even put some sort of pink bubble around people,\" she added.",
      "Another short meditation that can be done almost anywhere involves breathing deeply and mentally scanning your body for sensations, a technique popularized in the U.S. by mindfulness practitioner Jon Kabat-Zinn. Depending on your location and comfort level, you can keep your eyes open or closed.",

      "\u201cYou\u2019re intentionally scanning your body,\u201d Beyer said. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking about, how do your feet feel in your shoes? How do your ankles feel? Knees, hips, ribs, shoulders, neck, head, and by the time you know it, you checked in with every part of your body.\"",
      "Another discreet meditation technique is breathing deeply and joining your pointer finger to your thumb to form a circle. You can do this if you feel your stress level rising. \u201cSay to yourself, whenever I put my finger and thumb together, I will be able to be peaceful and open-minded,\u201d Remati said.",
      "If you're in a meeting and start to feel resentful or left out, you can do it under the table, and no one will know, she added. Remati does this herself if she notices she's becoming judgmental or short-tempered. \u201cYou just do the finger and thumb, take a nice deep breath, get grounded, and then get back into the meeting and feeling positive,\u201d she said.",
      "One of Beyer's favorite techniques is best done when there aren't a lot of people nearby. Truck drivers can do it in traffic. You inhale, and then when you're breathing out, you hum with your lips closed, she said.",
      "\u201cIt's going to immediately take down stress levels in the body and even in the mind,\u201d Beyer said. \u201cWhen you inhale and you focus on humming, then your brain is focused on that, not the \u2018what ifs' or the worries that like to take over when we feel stressed.\u201d",
      "If you feel self-conscious about humming in a quiet office, you can step outside or head to a noisier place.",
      "The shoulder and jaw release technique also may help relax the bodies of train passengers or drivers or stuck in traffic, Beyer said. To start, inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth. Repeat that, and then on the third exhale, roll your shoulders back. Inhale a fourth time and then on the next exhale relax your tongue and jaw, Beyer said. Finally, inhale again, bring your attention to your hands and just let them hang heavy, she said. Then breathe in and out a sixth time.",
      "Another technique Remati encourages is saying mantras or affirmations, which are positive statements or slogans you repeat to yourself. You can write them down and say them in your head or out loud while breathing deeply, before a meeting or at any point throughout the day.",
      "Some phrases you might say: \u201cI am calm.\" Deep breath. \u201cI am confident.\u201d Deep breath. \"I am ready for success,\u201d Remati suggested. \u201cI speak my truth. I am patient. I am here for the highest good of all.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats kept their promise to reject any Republican spending bill that didn\u2019t extend or restore health care benefits, choosing instead to force a government shutdown. Now they have to figure out how to get out of it.",
      "Just hours after the shutdown began, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said that if the Republicans work with them, \u201cthe shutdown could go away very quickly.\u201d",
      "But that won\u2019t be easy. Republican leaders \u2014 Senate Majority Leader John Thune, House Speaker Mike Johnson and President Donald Trump \u2014 have said that they won\u2019t negotiate or be \u201cheld hostage \u201d by Democrats demanding concessions to reopen the government. The bill Democrats voted against was a simple extension of funding for 45 days, legislation they say should be noncontroversial.",
      "While that uncompromising Republican position may not last long \u2014 there were some early, informal talks on the Senate floor Wednesday \u2014 reaching a deal would be difficult. It\u2019s deeply uncertain, for now, if the two sides could find common ground on health care policy or sow enough trust for the Democrats to change their position.",
      "At the same time, an extended shutdown could be increasingly painful for Democrats. The Trump administration has threatened to lay off thousands of workers and target Democratic-leaning states. On Wednesday, the White House announced it was putting a hold on subway and tunnel projects in Schumer\u2019s home state of New York.",
      "\u201cThis Democrat shutdown is actually delaying progress on the issues that Democrats claim to be interested in,\u201d Thune, who represents South Dakota, said on the Senate floor Wednesday.",
      "Republicans were encouraged Tuesday evening when three Democrats voted with them to keep the government open \u2014 Democratic Sens. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine.",
      "Republicans, who hold the majority, need eight Democrats to win the 60 votes needed for passage in the 53-47 Senate. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul was the only Republican to vote with Democrats against the measure.",
      "Thune is holding repeated votes on the measure, which failed 55-45 on Tuesday night and again Wednesday morning. He said he hopes that five Democrats will eventually feel the pressure and support the bill \u201cwhen they realize that this is playing a losing hand.\u201d",
      "Republicans are eyeing several moderate Democrats who appeared to be wavering before casting \u201cno\u201d votes on Tuesday night, including Sens. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Gary Peters of Michigan. Both voted to keep the government open in March, along with Schumer, while many of their colleagues voted for a shutdown.",
      "But Shaheen and Peters each voted no on Tuesday after extensive negotiations with colleagues in both parties on the floor. Shaheen said afterward that \u201cI have been in intensive conversations with colleagues from both sides of the aisle on how to find a path forward and I\u2019m eager to work with my Republican colleagues to find common ground.\u201d",
      "As some Democrats are already looking for a way out, others say they need to dig in and fight.",
      "\u201cAs Donald Trump\u2019s lawlessness grows during this shutdown, our spines should stiffen, not bend,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said in a social media post on Wednesday. \u201cLet\u2019s stand for something. The American people don\u2019t want us to fund the destruction of their health care and the destruction of our democracy.\u201d",
      "The divisions in the caucus pose a dilemma for Schumer, who was blasted by base voters and activists in March when he voted with Republicans to keep the government open. Many Democrats in the House and Senate have suggested that shutting down the government is their only leverage to fight Trump and push back on his policies, including health care and spending cuts.",
      "\u201cStanding up to (Trump) on this is sending a message to him on those other issues as well,\u201d said Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.",
      "Democrats have demanded that Republicans immediately extend health care subsidies for people who purchase coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. The expanded subsidies first put in place in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic are set to expire at the end of the year, raising premium costs for millions of people.",

An additional 828 employees can keep working because they aren't funded by the annual federal budget and instead get their pay from fees and such.",

      "The Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services has brought hundreds of fraud cases in the last five years that are heavily reliant on transactional data with the goal of revoking people\u2019s federal food benefits",
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- A single mother who relied on federal food assistance lost her benefits in 2020 after Kentucky investigators concluded she\u2019d committed fraud.",
      "The state alleged she had made multiple same-day purchases, tried to overdraw her account a few times, entered a few invalid PINs and sometimes made \u201cwhole-dollar\u201d purchases that are unlikely during typical grocery runs.",
      "The woman from Salyersville in Appalachian Kentucky had an explanation: She worked at the store. She would sometimes buy lunch there and then get groceries after work. Her child would also occasionally use her card.",
      "An administrative hearing officer kicked her off the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) regardless, based solely on the allegedly suspicious shopping pattern. She sued \u2014 and won.",
      "\u201cIt is draconian to take away SNAP benefits from a single mother without clear and convincing evidence that intentional trafficking was occurring during a time when food scarcity is so prevalent,\u201d Franklin County Judge Thomas Wingate said in his 2023 decision.",
      "Over the last five years, the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services has brought hundreds of fraud cases that are heavily reliant on transactional data with the goal of revoking people\u2019s food benefits.",
      "Judges, lawyers and legal experts said in interviews and in court documents that such evidence proves little. Kentucky Public Radio reviewed dozens of administrative hearing decisions and court documents from the last five years in which the cabinet relied on shopping patterns to prove a person had \u201ctrafficked,\u201d or sold, their benefits.",
      "Kentucky is so aggressive in disqualifying people from SNAP benefits that the state is second in the nation for per-capita administrative disqualifications, behind Florida, according to the most recent federal data from 2023.",
      "In the last decade, disqualifications in Kentucky rose from fewer than 100 in 2015 to over 1,800 in 2023. And more than 300 others have been accused of selling or misusing their benefits since January 2024, according to records obtained by Kentucky Public Radio.",
      "Another Franklin County judge in 2023 ordered the cabinet to stop disqualifying individuals based solely on transactional data, but since the decision, at least three lawsuits allege the health agency continues to bring such cases.",
      "Transactional data alone cannot prove intent to commit fraud nor show the actual result of any individual transaction, University of Kentucky law professor Cory Dodds said, adding, \u201cI\u2019m not saying that folks didn\u2019t do it, didn\u2019t commit the fraud, but I don\u2019t think the cabinet in a lot of these cases has met their burden of proof, either.\u201d",
      "Kentuckians receive notice of their alleged suspicious activity through mailed letters, in which they\u2019re asked to voluntarily waive their right to a hearing and automatically accept the punishment. On first offense, that\u2019s generally a one-year SNAP ban. They\u2019re also required to repay the full amount the state says they misused.",
      "Often, these cases involve a relatively small amount of money. Records show that more than 900 people have been kicked off for \u201ctrafficking\u201d or misuse for less than $1,000 since 2022. The lowest amount alleged was 14 cents.",
      "The state has leaned heavily on administrative hearing waivers since 2015, and by 2023, almost a quarter of all disqualifications were via waiver. Some lawsuits allege individuals did not fully understand the consequences of the waivers and were encouraged to sign by officials.",
      "Kentucky Public Radio reviewed more than two dozen cases since 2020 in which the cabinet accused an individual of trafficking using only spending patterns, despite the participants\u2019 denial or lack of response \u2014 and with no other evidence or interviews presented, according to administrative hearing decisions.",
      "Kendra Steele, a spokesperson for the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, declined to schedule an interview with cabinet officials after multiple requests. Steele said in an email that \u201cwe have never\u201d brought trafficking cases based solely on transactional data and acknowledged it would not be sufficient to prove intent.",
      "In response to a different question, Steele wrote the investigation into fraud allegations consists of looking into income, living situations \u201cand patterns of spending that are indicative of trafficking.\u201d She did not indicate how any of those factors could be used to prove intentional misuse or selling of SNAP benefits, or how it differs from relying on transactional data \u2014 which is inherently a pattern of spending. Steele said in another email that they also interview vendors and SNAP recipients.",
      "Roughly 4 in 25 Kentuckians suffer from food insecurity, similar to the national rate of about 14%, according to an Associated Press analysis of U.S. Census Bureau and Feeding America data.",
      "The USDA will stop collecting and releasing statistics on food insecurity after October, saying Sept. 20 that the numbers had become \u201coverly politicized.\u201d The decision comes in the wake of federal funding cuts for food and nutrition safety net programs nationwide.",
      "In the last fiscal year, 1 in 8 Kentuckians benefitted from SNAP, formerly called food stamps. Food insecurity in Kentucky\u2019s rural areas is even more stark, and legal representation harder to come by.",
      "\u201cThe people who benefit from these programs are some of the folks that we need to be helping the most in this country,\u201d Dodds said. \u201cIt\u2019s our fellow Kentuckians who are going hungry as a result of baseless allegations of waste, fraud and abuse.\u201d",

But administrative hearing decisions reviewed by KPR from 2020 through 2023 included evidence the cabinet relied on; hearing officers would frequently say a person had trafficked their benefits based on shopping patterns the state deemed suspicious.",
      "National legal experts who specialize in SNAP access say an overreliance on transactional data isn\u2019t unique to Kentucky. Transactional data was initially meant as a tool to identify potential fraud cases \u2014 not as a means to prove it, Georgetown law professor David Super said.",
      "He\u2019s studied SNAP disqualifications for decades, and has seen many cases where he believes transactional data is misconstrued as direct evidence of wrongdoing, instead of requiring a state to build cases with witnesses, affidavits, video evidence and plea deals.",
      "In one redacted 2023 state administrative hearing decision, a hearing officer decided a woman in the eastern Kentucky city of McKee had trafficked her benefits because she had made eight back-to-back transactions in a year. The decision also said she\u2019d checked her balance several times, made a few insufficient fund attempts and had incorrectly entered her PIN number a few times.",
      "She lost her SNAP benefits for a year. In an appeal, the woman told the state she has two kids and had recently discovered she was pregnant.",
      "\u201cEveryone forgets to get something and has to go back in the store and get it,\u201d she wrote, defending her back-to-back purchases.",
      "She received another hearing, but the outcome didn\u2019t change.",
      "Cabinet officials acknowledged in cross examinations during a 2023 case that back-to-back transactions and whole-dollar purchases aren\u2019t forbidden under SNAP rules, nor are recipients told that the cabinet considers them suspicious.",
      "But all of these things are used as evidence \u2014 sometimes the sole evidence \u2014 that a person misused their benefits.",
      "Kristie Goff, an AppalRed legal aid lawyer in Prestonsburg in southeast Kentucky, used to see many of these cases, though they\u2019ve declined in the last year.",
      "\u201cThere have been very few instances in cases I have handled, where a client was not able to give me a perfectly reasonable explanation for those transactions, and none of it was trafficking,\u201d Goff said. \u201cThere are no receipts, there\u2019s no video footage to show that someone\u2019s doing anything wrong. It\u2019s just a number written on a paper.\u201d",
      "While saying purchasing history is insufficient to prove trafficking, Kentucky judges have stopped short of demanding that the state change how it trains employees or conducts its SNAP investigations.",
      "In response to an open records request, the cabinet provided KPR with documents used to train investigators on intentional program violations. They appear to almost exclusively discuss transactional data, including investigating back-to-back payments, large transactions and whole-dollar purchases.",
      "In 2020, Michigan appellate judges decided transactional data alone is never sufficient to prove that a business \u2014 or person \u2014 fraudulently used SNAP benefits.",
      "Dodds believes that should be the standard for all states, including Kentucky.",
      "He is in the early stages of systematically reviewing thousands of SNAP benefit trafficking hearing decisions between 2020 and 2023. Data from about 700 decisions in 2020 alone already shows that many Kentuckians have been denied benefits before the state presents what he considers real evidence of guilt.",
      "\u201cThere are maybe a handful of cases that I would say there was real evidence that they had done something wrong,\u201d Dodds said. \u201cThere was one where a woman was on the phone with the hearing officer while she was actively trying to sell her benefits. ...

They come from a network of nearly 900 bakers in four states \u2014 Washington, Oregon, California and Idaho \u2014 and represent one of the largest such efforts in the country.",
      "Now, amid rising grocery prices and federal cuts to food aid for low-income people, demand for the group's donations of nutritious baked goods is greater than ever, Kehrli said.",
      "\u201cMost of our food banks do not get any kind of whole-grain sandwich bread donation,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we ask what we could do better, they just say, \u2018Bring us more.\u2019\u201d",
      "Ewaldsen\u2019s bread goes to the nearby Edmonds Food Bank, where the client list has swelled from 350 households to nearly 1,000 in the past three years, according to program manager Lester Almanza.",
      "Nationwide, more than 50 million people a year receive charitable food assistance, according to Feeding America, a hunger relief organization.",
      "Anti-hunger experts say they expect the need to rise as recent federal legislation sharply cutting food aid to poor people takes effect. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the tax and spending cuts bill Republicans muscled through Congress in July means 3 million people would not qualify for food stamps, also known as SNAP benefits.",
      "Gauging the impact, however, could soon be more difficult after the U.S. Agriculture Department recently said it would halt an annual report on hunger in America, saying it was redundant, costly and politicized \u201csubjective liberal fodder.\u201d After 30 years, the 2024 report, to be released on Oct. 22, will be the last, the agency said.",
      "\u201cEnding data collection will not end hunger, it will only make it a hidden crisis that is easier to ignore and more difficult to address,\u201d Crystal FitzSimons, president of the Food Research & Action Center, an advocacy group, said in a statement.",
      "Almanza said federal funding for his food bank has dropped at least 10% this year, meaning that every donation helps.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something that a lot of people rely on,\u201d he said.",
      "That includes people like Chris Redfearn, 42, and his wife, Melanie Rodriguez-Redfearn, 43, who turned to a food bank in Everett, Washington, last spring after moving to the area to find work. They had to stretch their savings until she began a new position this month teaching history at a local college. Chris Redfearn, who has worked for decades in business, is still looking.",
      "\u201cThe food pantry assists with anywhere from $40 to $80 worth of savings weekly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to keep ourselves afloat.\u201d",
      "Finding homemade bread from Community Loaves at a food pantry was a surprise, the couple said. Often, surplus bread sent by grocery stores includes highly processed white breads or sweets donated near their expiration or sell-by dates.",

      "\u201cI love to bake and just an idea sparked: Would it be possible for us to help from our home and get important valuable nutrition to our food banks?\u201d she recalled.",
      "Many food pantries don\u2019t accept or distribute donations of homemade baked goods. Feeding America warns individual bakers against the practice, saying \u201csince food banks can\u2019t confirm how your baked goods were made or their ingredients, they can\u2019t be donated.\"",
      "But health department rules vary by state, Kehrli learned. In Washington and the other three states where Community Loaves now operates, bread is one of the few foods allowed to be donated from a home kitchen through a program like theirs.",
      "\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be able to donate custard pies. We wouldn\u2019t be able to donate lasagna,\u201d Kehrli said. \u201cBut bread is deemed safe. Anything that is fully baked and does not require refrigeration.\u201d",
      "Still, Community Loaves bakers must follow approved recipes for the bread and two types of energy cookies. They obtain flour from common sources, and bake and deliver on a shared schedule twice a month.",
      "The bakers buy their own supplies, donating the cost of the ingredients as well as their time. Most make a few loaves per baking session before delivering them to local \u201chubs,\u201d where other volunteers collect the bread and transport it to the food banks.",
      "Bakers range from former professionals to beginners. A robust website with recipes and how-to videos backstops every step, Kehrli said.",
      "Baking the bread is satisfying on several levels, said Ewaldsen, who has donated nearly 800 loaves in less than two years. Part of it is addressing the physical need for food, but part is also addressing the spiritual hunger for connection with neighbors.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the opportunity for me to bake something and to share something with others in the community, where they don\u2019t necessarily need to know who I am, but they know that there\u2019s a community that loves and cares for them,\u201d she said.",
      "While such sentiments are sincere and admirable, anti-hunger experts stress that individual donations can't take the place of adequately funded government services for struggling Americans.",
      "\u201cIt's beautiful that our communities act this way,\u201d said Gina Plata-Nino of the Food Research & Action Center. \u201cBut it is a loaf of bread. That is going to feed one person \u2014 and there are millions in line.\"",

      "As mental health chatbots driven by artificial intelligence proliferate, a small number of states are trying to regulate them",
      "In the absence of stronger federal regulation, some states have begun regulating apps that offer AI \u201ctherapy\u201d as more people turn to artificial intelligence for mental health advice.",
      "But the laws, all passed this year, don't fully address the fast-changing landscape of AI software development. And app developers, policymakers and mental health advocates say the resulting patchwork of state laws isn't enough to protect users or hold the creators of harmful technology accountable.",
      "\u201cThe reality is millions of people are using these tools and they\u2019re not going back,\u201d said Karin Andrea Stephan, CEO and co-founder of the mental health chatbot app Earkick.",
      "___",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE \u2014 This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org.",
      "___",
      "The state laws take different approaches. Illinois and Nevada have banned the use of AI to treat mental health. Utah placed certain limits on therapy chatbots, including requiring them to protect users\u2019 health information and to clearly disclose that the chatbot isn\u2019t human. Pennsylvania, New Jersey and California are also considering ways to regulate AI therapy.",
      "The impact on users varies. Some apps have blocked access in states with bans. Others say they're making no changes as they wait for more legal clarity.",
      "And many of the laws don't cover generic chatbots like ChatGPT, which are not explicitly marketed for therapy but are used by an untold number of people for it. Those bots have attracted lawsuits in horrific instances where users lost their grip on reality or took their own lives after interacting with them.",
      "Vaile Wright, who oversees health care innovation at the American Psychological Association, agreed that the apps could fill a need, noting a nationwide shortage of mental health providers, high costs for care and uneven access for insured patients.",
      "Mental health chatbots that are rooted in science, created with expert input and monitored by humans could change the landscape, Wright said.",
      "\u201cThis could be something that helps people before they get to crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what\u2019s on the commercial market currently.\u201d",
      "That's why federal regulation and oversight is needed, she said.",
      "Earlier this month, the Federal Trade Commission announced it was opening inquiries into seven AI chatbot companies \u2014 including the parent companies of Instagram and Facebook, Google, ChatGPT, Grok (the chatbot on X), Character.AI and Snapchat \u2014 on how they \"measure, test and monitor potentially negative impacts of this technology on children and teens.\u201d And the Food and Drug Administration is convening an advisory committee Nov. 6 to review generative AI-enabled mental health devices.",
      "Federal agencies could consider restrictions on how chatbots are marketed, limit addictive practices, require disclosures to users that they are not medical providers, require companies to track and report suicidal thoughts, and offer legal protections for people who report bad practices by companies, Wright said.",
      "From \"companion apps\u201d to \u201cAI therapists\u201d to \u201cmental wellness\u201d apps, AI\u2019s use in mental health care is varied and hard to define, let alone write laws around.",
      "That has led to different regulatory approaches. Some states, for example, take aim at companion apps that are designed just for friendship, but don't wade into mental health care. The laws in Illinois and Nevada ban products that claim to provide mental health treatment outright, threatening fines up to $10,000 in Illinois and $15,000 in Nevada.",
      "But even a single app can be tough to categorize.",
      "Earkick's Stephan said there is still a lot that is \u201cvery muddy\u201d about Illinois' law, for example, and the company has not limited access there.",
      "Stephan and her team initially held off calling their chatbot, which looks like a cartoon panda, a therapist. But when users began using the word in reviews, they embraced the terminology so the app would show up in searches.",
      "Last week, they backed off using therapy and medical terms again. Earkick\u2019s website described its chatbot as \u201cYour empathetic AI counselor, equipped to support your mental health journey,\u201d but now it\u2019s a \u201cchatbot for self care.\u201d",

      "Nicholas Jacobson, a clinical psychologist whose lab is leading the research, said the results showed early promise but that larger studies are needed to demonstrate whether Therabot works for large numbers of people.",
      "\u201cThe space is so dramatically new that I think the field needs to proceed with much greater caution that is happening right now,\u201d he said.",
      "Many AI apps are optimized for engagement and are built to support everything users say, rather than challenging peoples\u2019 thoughts the way therapists do. Many walk the line of companionship and therapy, blurring intimacy boundaries therapists ethically would not.",
      "Therabot\u2019s team sought to avoid those issues.",
      "The app is still in testing and not widely available. But Jacobson worries about what strict bans will mean for developers taking a careful approach. He noted Illinois had no clear pathway to provide evidence that an app is safe and effective.",
      "\u201cThey want to protect folks, but the traditional system right now is really failing folks,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, trying to stick with the status quo is really not the thing to do.\u201d",

      "WINTERPORT, Maine -- Phylis Allen spends her days looking for things. She searches for potatoes at Sam\u2019s Club, cheap beets and ginger at Walmart and a local grocery store. She studies the weekly inventory from Good Shepherd, Maine\u2019s only food bank, for good deals on butter and cheese.",
      "Every Monday morning, she shops at three different stores, keeping lists of prices in her head and remembering what particular clients want. On a recent trip to Sam\u2019s Club, she was searching for affordable eggs.",
      "The diminutive 78-year-old food pantry director found them in a huge cooler. Stretching, she pulled two huge boxes off the top shelf \u2014 seven dozen eggs each, $21 a box. \u201c$2.82 a dozen,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a good price for eggs.\u201d",
      "The eggs were destined for Neighbor\u2019s Cupboard, the food pantry in Winterport, Maine, that Allen has helped run for the past 17 years. Every Wednesday, she and a tightknit group of volunteers provide 25 to 30 families with heaping bags of food.",
      "Maine has long been one of the most food insecure states in New England. Directors of food pantries say the task of making sure people are fed is getting harder because of diminishing food supplies, increasing demand and an overwhelming reliance on volunteers, many of whom are retirees with ages up into their 80s.",
      "About one in seven people in rural Waldo County, where Neighbor\u2019s Cupboard is, were food insecure in 2023, a rate that was similar to the state and national average, according to an Associated Press analysis of U.S. Census Bureau and Feeding America data.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture will stop collecting and releasing statistics on food insecurity after October, saying on Sept. 20 that the numbers had become \u201coverly politicized.\u201d",
      "In March, the Trump administration cut more than $1 billion from two U.S. Department of Agriculture programs \u2014 the Emergency Food Assistance Program, which provides free food to food banks nationwide, and the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program, which provides funds to state, territorial and tribal governments to purchase food from local farmers for distribution to hunger relief organizations.",
      "\u201cI can watch the availability of federal food going down every month,\u201d Allen said.",
      "Charitable food networks are also bracing for $186 billion in cuts for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the federal low-income nutrition program better known as food stamps. In turn, Feeding America predicts that food pantries will see more demand.",
      "Complicating matters is the infrastructure through which the U.S. distributes most food to those who need help. In Maine, the nearly 600 hunger relief agencies that get free and low-cost food from Good Shepherd Food Bank rely on volunteers. This includes 250 food pantries as well as soup kitchens, senior centers, shelters, schools and youth programs.",
      "More than 75% of these organizations rely completely on volunteers, with no paid staff, according to Good Shepherd.",

      "\u201cIf our goal is to end hunger in Maine, which is a lofty goal, then we\u2019re not going to do that through a charitable food network that\u2019s run by volunteers, right?\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s supposed to be for crisis situations \u2026 but what has happened is that it is just a part of the food system now. It shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d",
      "Neighbor\u2019s Cupboard hummed with activity on a recent Wednesday morning, cans stacked in piles six feet high and children\u2019s collages taped to a cooler.",
      "Keith Ritchie was greeting clients \u2014 and keeping a gentle eye out to make sure no one took more than their fair share of limited foods. At 89, he is the pantry\u2019s oldest worker, although Betty Williams, 88, teases him about who\u2019s older.",
      "In more than 17 years of service, Ritchie said, \u201cI\u2019ve only missed twice.\u201d He drives 20 miles (32 kilometers) each way to dole out groceries and fill bags with \u201csurprises\u201d \u2013 donated items like Girl Scout cookies.",

      "Vivienne Westwood's legacy shines at Paris Fashion Week with a theatrical show at the Institut de France",
      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 Light streamed through the stained glass of the Institut de France onto a surreal stage: a lone cellist playing a melancholy air, next to an upside-down umbrella and a rotating tableau of dying sunflowers. It was a theatrical overture for Saturday's Paris Fashion Week. This was spring \u2014 Vivienne Westwood style.",
      "Andreas Kronthaler, who has helmed the house since Westwood\u2019s death in 2022 and whose name joined the label in 2016, leaned hard into the madhat energy that made the brand a legend. Leopard-print men\u2019s underwear sat alongside sheer, ribbed tunics with a medieval air. Punk flashed in a jeweled veil and glittered lapels. Models strode in floppy, swashbuckling \u201970s boots that turned the grand academic setting into a carnival.",
      "The lineup spoke fluent Westwood: draped and deconstructed silhouettes, gathered dresses with double skirts, tailoring cut just off balance. Colors clashed on purpose, with sour greens near reds \u2014 until the eye adjusted and chaos clicked into order. One jeweled necklace made it literal: \u201cCHAOS.\u201d",
      "Westwood made her name on King\u2019s Road in the 1970s, wiring tartan, corsetry and ripped tees into the grammar of punk. That outsider spirit still drives the house, even as its reach has gone mainstream. Since Sarah Jessica Parker\u2019s iconic Westwood bridal gown in \u201c Sex and the City,\u201d the label\u2019s wedding business has boomed \u2014 a point underscored by the hundreds of noisy fans thronging the Institut de France on Saturday, jostling for a glimpse.",
      "Kronthaler has long thrived on turning bourgeois classics inside out \u2014 warping jackets, loading corsetry into knits, twisting tartan into punk romance. That maximalist urge can tip into excess, yet it is also the house\u2019s lifeblood, keeping Westwood\u2019s language loud and elastic rather than embalmed.",
      "Much of Westwood\u2019s power has historically come from mining and mutating the archive \u2014 the \u201980s corset legacy, Napoleonic swagger, Shakespearean drama. Since Westwood\u2019s passing, Kronthaler has shifted from careful custodian to provocateur, forging new hybrids instead of simply quoting the past. Saturday\u2019s show advanced that shift: historic tunics, technical fabrics and second-skin underwear collided by design, not accident.",

      "Similar movements have risen in countries such as Madagascar, Kenya, Peru, and Nepal. They differ in origin but share in common a refusal to go through institutions like political parties or unions to be heard.",
      "In Morocco, anger has boiled over contrasts between government spending on stadiums in the lead-up to the 2030 FIFA World Cup and a subpar health system that lags behind countries with similarly sized economies.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know:",
      "A leaderless collective called Gen Z 212 \u2014 named after Morocco\u2019s dialing code \u2014 is the engine behind the protests. Members debate strategy on Discord, a chat app popular with gamers and teens. The core group has about 180,000 members, but spin-offs have also sprouted, organizing demonstrations in towns independently.",
      "Like other nations swept by Gen Z protests, Morocco is experiencing a youth bulge, with more than half of the population under 35. Yet as the country pours billions into infrastructure and tourism, unemployment for Moroccans ages 15-24 has climbed to 36%. And with opportunity lacking, more than half of Moroccans under 35 say they have considered emigrating, according to a June survey from Afrobarometer.",
      "When midweek demonstrations turned violent, officials said most participants were minors and rights groups say many detained were under 18.",
      "Morocco is Africa\u2019s most visited country, appealing to tourists from around the world with its medieval palaces, bustling markets, and sweeping mountain and desert landscapes. But not far from tourist routes, the daily reality for most of Morocco\u2019s 37 million people includes soaring costs of living and stagnating wages.",
      "The North African Kingdom has made significant strides in lifting standards of living, but critics say that development has been uneven and even exacerbated inequities.",
      "Morocco boasts Africa\u2019s only high-speed rail line and is constructing seven new stadiums and renovating seven others in preparation for the 2030 FIFA World Cup, on which it plans to spend nearly $16 billion on infrastructure, some from the private sector. Yet with a monthly minimum wage of around $300, many languish in poverty in areas where roads are unpaved, hospitals lack doctors and classrooms are underfunded and overcrowded.",
      "Morocco has only 7.7 medical professionals per 10,000 inhabitants and far fewer in parts of the south and east where protests have become most heated. The public health system provides more than 80% of care, but accounts for only 40% of spending, with the rest coming from private or out-of-pocket costs.",
      "Before Gen Z 212, localized protests against regional inequities and government priorities erupted, including in Al Haouz, where many remain in tents more than two years after a deadly 2023 earthquake. Anger boiled over in September after eight women died giving birth in a public hospital in the coastal city of Agadir. Despite its renovated airport and reputation as a destination for tourists, the city is the capital of one of Morocco\u2019s poorest provinces, Sousse-Massa, where residents have decried a lack of doctors and quality medical care.",

At the time, he acknowledged development had not adequately trickled down to benefit all and promised progress was underway.",

      "A prolific author, Klima published novels, plays, short story collections and essays as well as children\u2019s books, becoming an internationally known writer whose works were translated into more than 30 languages.",
      "Born Ivan Kauders on Sept 14, 1931, in Prague, Klima faced his first repressive regime during World War II when his Jewish family was transported to the Nazis' Theresienstadt concentration camp. Against the odds, they all survived.",
      "The new Communist regime that took power in Czechoslovakia in 1948 looked promising at first for Klima and many others who had been persecuted.",
      "Klima belonged to a group of talented writers \u2014 including Milan Kundera, Pavel Kohout and Ludvik Vacul\u00edk \u2014 who turned to communism with high hopes after the war only to be bitterly disappointed by its totalitarian nature and its ruthless liquidation of opponents.",
      "Kl\u00edma joined the Communist Party in 1953, the same year his father was imprisoned for political reasons. He was expelled from the party in 1967 after criticizing the Communist regime in a speech at a writers\u2019 meeting.",
      "A year later, his writings were banned after a Soviet-led military invasion in 1968 crushed the liberal reforms of Alexander Dub\u010dek\u2019s government and ended a more liberal era known as the \u201cPrague Spring.\u201d",

      "\u201cAnd that happened despite the fact that those countries belonged to our civilization, they were the countries with a rich cultural tradition,\u201d he said.",
      "After studying Czech language and literary theory at Charles University in Prague in the 1950s, Kl\u00edma worked as an editor for several literary journals and began writing for magazines. His multi-layered stories and novels, including his highly acclaimed \u201cJudge on Trial,\u201d captured the situation of individuals facing the machinery of the totalitarian state.",

      "Hungary remains firm in maintaining its supplies of Russian oil and gas, even as the European Union accelerates efforts to cut Russian energy imports",
      "BUDAPEST, Hungary -- BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) \u2014 As the European Union pushes to fully sever its reliance on Russian energy and the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump urges NATO members to abandon Russian oil, one country's populist government stands firm.",
      "Hungary and its leader, Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, have long argued Russian energy imports are indispensable for the country's economy and switching to fossil fuels sourced from elsewhere would cause an immediate economic collapse.",
      "Orb\u00e1n, who has long had the friendliest ties to the Kremlin of any EU leader, has vigorously opposed the bloc's efforts to sanction Moscow after its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and blasted attempts to hit Russia's energy revenues that help finance the war.",
      "As the rest of Europe has weaned off Russian energy, Hungary has maintained, and even increased, its Russian imports, insisting no viable alternative exists.",
      "But some energy experts \u2014 as well as Orb\u00e1n's critics, who see his commitment to Russian energy as a symptom of his affinity for President Vladimir Putin \u2014 say the Hungarian leader's position is more about politics than pipelines.",
      "Hungary's leaders argue its landlocked geography in the heart of Central Europe make it dependent on Russian fossil fuels delivered by pipelines built while Hungary was under Soviet dominance.",
      "With no alternative sources and infrastructure to bring oil and gas to Hungary, officials say, the country's economy would cease to function without Russian supplies.",
      "\u201cIf Hungary is cut off from Russian oil and natural gas, then immediately, within a minute, Hungarian economic performance will drop by 4%,\u201d Orb\u00e1n told state radio in September. \u201cThis would be catastrophic, the Hungarian economy would be on its knees.\u201d",
      "But L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Mikl\u00f3s, a chemical engineer and energy industry analyst, told The Associated Press there was \u201cno rational explanation\u201d for Orb\u00e1n's government's reluctance to seek alternative fuel sources and ample infrastructure is already in place to supply Hungary with affordable, non-Russian oil and gas.",
      "\u201cDisconnection from Russian energy in an integrated European market should not be a problem, all conditions are there. It's the intention that is missing,\u201d Mikl\u00f3s said.",
      "EU countries moved quickly to slash their imports of Russian oil and gas after Russia invaded Ukraine, instituting an embargo on Russian oil in 2022 and, this year, announcing a proposal to gradually stop the import of all Russian gas and oil into the bloc by the end of 2027.",
      "Yet as the EU sought to deprive Putin of revenue that helps fuel the war, it also granted a temporary exemption for supplies delivered by pipeline to three landlocked countries: the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia.",
      "That carve out, Mikl\u00f3s said, has allowed the Hungarian government and the national oil and gas conglomerate MOL to take in major windfall profits and deliver billions of dollars to Russia's budget.",
      "\u201cPeople think that Hungary purchases Russian energy for economic benefit. This is wrong,\u201d said Mikl\u00f3s, who previously served as MOL's director of corporate relations. \"Hungary buys Russian energy because the Hungarian government wants to help Russia arm itself ... MOL and the Hungarian government's significant profits are a side effect of that.\u201d",
      "The EU's push to cut Russia off from energy revenues has sparked fury from Hungary's leaders, who portray the steps as misguided and ideologically motivated.",
      "\u201cIt is quite astonishing that the leaders of European countries ... are unable to see that each country\u2019s geographical location determines where it can purchase energy sources,\u201d Hungarian Foreign Minister P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 said in a September social media post. \u201cWe can dream about buying gas and oil from places that are not connected by pipelines, but we cannot heat our homes, boil water or run factories with dreams.\u201d",

      "Despite insistence that a lack of infrastructure precludes a transition to non-Russian energy sources, other countries in the region, similarly landlocked, have brought Russian oil first to a trickle, then to a stop.",
      "Earlier this year, leaders of the Czech Republic, which previously received about half its oil from Russia via the Druzhba pipeline, celebrated the country's \u201coil independence day\u201d after doubling the capacity of an Italian pipeline, the last infrastructural development necessary to end Russian oil imports.",
      "Hungary, which currently receives the vast majority of its crude from Russia via the Druzhba pipeline, already has a second pipeline in place: the Adria, which runs from Croatia's Adriatic Sea.",
      "MOL says it requires around 14 million tons (12.7 million metric tons) of crude per year, but recent tests on the Adria pipeline showed it is incapable of reliably delivering such a quantity.",
      "The Croatian oil transport company Janaf disputes that claim, saying it is prepared to cover both Hungary and neighboring Slovakia's total annual demands for crude oil.",
      "Mikl\u00f3s said even if Adria were incapable of providing for all of Hungary's oil needs, it can still play a major role in decreasing imports from Russia.",
      "\u201cIt is possible to bring oil from elsewhere, the Adria pipeline has been available for several decades,\u201d he said. \u201cIf what they say is true and they need 14 to 15 million tons (per year), it would still be logical to take 10 million tons from the Adria and bring the rest on Druzhba.\u201d",
      "Hungary's government has portrayed EU efforts to cease Russian energy imports as an existential threat to a popular, government-backed household utility reduction program. In May, Orb\u00e1n claimed in a video that household electricity bills would double and gas bills would nearly triple if Russian supplies were eliminated.",
      "Yet according to Borb\u00e1la Tak\u00e1csn\u00e9 T\u00f3th, a gas industry research analyst, the price Hungary pays for Russian gas is based on European benchmark prices and is not substantially cheaper than what other countries pay for non-Russian gas.",
      "T\u00f3th, who works at the Regional Centre for Energy Policy Research, an independent institute affiliated with Corvinus University of Budapest, said her group's modeling shows breaking with Russian gas would likely cause \u201ca temporary increase of 1.5 to 2 euros per megawatt hour,\" a price hike she called \u201cminimal, below 5%.\u201d",
      "Despite the rhetorical commitment to Russian energy from Hungary's politicians, national energy company MOL has undertaken investments in recent years to diversify its supplies and outfit its refineries in Hungary and Slovakia to process non-Russian crude.",
      "The company said in an email that due to a multiyear, $500 million investment, \"we will be (in) a much better position to have a more diverse crude oil sourcing capability\u201d by the end of 2026.",
      "Mikl\u00f3s said that despite the Hungarian government's determination to continue purchasing Russian energy, EU regulations will soon bring that to an end.",
      "\u201cThings will clearly never be the same again, because the European Union has learned that, to put it simply, Russia cannot be trusted,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a matter of political will to break away from Russian energy sources. There is a small price to pay for this, which every other European country is paying.\u201d",

      "Standing behind the police cordon that still surrounds the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in the city\u2019s Crumpsall neighborhood, the mourners said they felt forgotten by a society that has allowed antisemitism in the U.K. to grow unchallenged over the last two years.",

      "Archbishop Mikael Ajapahyan was arrested in June and accused of being part of an alleged coup plot against the government of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan.",
      "The cleric was found guilty on Sept. 24 of calling for the government to be overthrown. His lawyer, Ara Zohrabyan, condemned the verdict as being politically motivated.",
      "Ajapahyan was prosecuted for merely expressing an opinion, said Zohrabyan, who vowed to appeal the verdict.",
      "The Armenian Apostolic Church also condemned the verdict as politically motivated, describing it as \u201cone of the clear manifestations of the authorities\u2019 anti-church campaign.\u201d",
      "The authorities had tried to detain Ajapahyan in June, which led to security forces facing off with crowds at the headquarters of the Armenian Apostolic Church. Videos circulated online showed clergymen jostling with police.",
      "After Armenia\u2019s National Security Service urged Ajapahyan to appear before authorities, local media showed him entering the building of Armenia\u2019s Investigative Committee. The following day, a court in Yerevan ordered to place Ajapahyan in pretrial detention.",
      "Ajapahyan's arrest followed that of Archbishop Bagrat Galstanyan, who lead the Sacred Struggle opposition movement. He was accused of plotting a sabotage campaign to overthrow Pashinyan, charges that his lawyer rejected as \u201cfiction.\u201d",

      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom has signed a bill allowing 800,000 Uber and Lyft drivers in the state to join a union and bargain collectively for better wages and benefits",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 More than 800,000 drivers for ride-hailing companies in California will soon be able to join a union and bargain collectively for better wages and benefits under a measure signed Friday by Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
      "Supporters said the new law will open a path for the largest expansion of private sector collective bargaining rights in the state's history. The legislation is a significant compromise in the yearslong battle between labor unions and tech companies.",
      "California is the second state where Uber and Lyft drivers can unionize as independent contractors. Massachusetts voters passed a ballot referendum in November allowing unionization, while drivers in Illinois and Minnesota are pushing for similar rights.",
      "Newsom announced the signing at an unrelated news conference at University of California, Berkeley. The new law will give drivers \u201cdignity and a say about their future,\u201d he said.",
      "The new law is part of an agreement made in September between Newsom, state lawmakers and the Service Employees International Union, along with rideshare companies Uber and Lyft. In exchange, Newsom also signed a measure supported by Uber and Lyft to significantly cut the companies' insurance requirements for accidents caused by underinsured drivers.",
      "Lyft CEO David Risher said in September that the new insurance rates are expected to save the company $200 million and could help reduce fares.",
      "Uber and Lyft fares in California are consistently higher than in other parts of the U.S. because of insurance requirements, the companies say. Uber has said that nearly one-third of every ride fare in the state goes toward paying for state-mandated insurance.",
      "Labor unions and tech companies have fought for years over drivers' rights. In July of last year, the California Supreme Court ruled that app-based ride-hailing and delivery services like Uber and Lyft can continue treating their drivers as independent contractors not entitled to benefits like overtime pay, paid sick leave and unemployment insurance. A 2019 law mandated that Uber and Lyft provide drivers with benefits, but voters reversed it at the ballot in 2020.",
      "The collective bargaining measure now allows rideshare workers in California to join a union while still being classified as independent contractors and requires gig companies to bargain in good faith. The new law doesn\u2019t apply to drivers for delivery apps like DoorDash.",
      "The insurance measure will reduce the coverage requirement for accidents caused by uninsured or underinsured drivers from $1 million to $60,000 per individual and $300,000 per accident.",
      "The two measures \"together represent a compromise that lowers costs for riders while creating stronger voices for drivers \u2014demonstrating how industry, labor, and lawmakers can work together to deliver real solutions,\u201d Ramona Prieto, head of public policy for California at Uber, said in a statement.",

      "But with the government shut down, no information was released Friday about hiring in September.",
      "It's the first time since a government shutdown in 2013 that the jobs report has been delayed. During the 2018-2019 partial government closure, the Labor Department was one of several agencies that remained open because Congress had agreed to fund them. September's jobs figures will be released eventually, once the shutdown ends.",
      "The interruption in the data has occurred at a particularly uncertain time, when policymakers at the Federal Reserve and Wall Street investors would need more data on the economy, rather than less. Hiring has ground nearly to a halt, threatening to drag down the broader economy. Yet at the same time, consumers \u2014 particularly higher-income earners \u2014 are still spending and some businesses are ramping up investments in data centers developing artificial intelligence models. Whether that is enough to revive hiring remains to be seen.",
      "For now, economists are turning to alternative measures of the job market provided by nonprofits and private-sector companies. Those measures mostly show a job market with little hiring, but not many layoffs, either. Those who have jobs appear to be mostly secure, while those looking for work are having a tougher time.",
      "Payroll processor ADP, for example, said Wednesday that its estimate showed the economy had lost a surprising 32,000 private-sector jobs last month.

      "VALHALLA, New York -- Pepsi has a new challenge: keeping products like Gatorade and Cheetos vivid and colorful without the artificial dyes that U.S. consumers are increasingly rejecting.",
      "PepsiCo, which also makes Doritos, Cap'n Crunch cereal, Funyuns and Mountain Dew, announced in April that it would accelerate a planned shift to using natural colors in its foods and beverages. Around 40% of its U.S. products now contain synthetic dyes, according to the company.",
      "But just as it took decades for artificial colors to seep into PepsiCo\u2019s products, removing them is likely to be a multi-year process. The company said it\u2019s still finding new ingredients, testing consumers\u2019 responses and waiting for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to approve natural alternatives. PepsiCo hasn\u2019t committed to meeting the Trump administration\u2019s goal of phasing out petroleum-based synthetic dyes by the end of 2026.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to launch a product that the consumer\u2019s not going to enjoy,\u201d said Chris Coleman, PepsiCo\u2019s senior director for food research and development in North America. \u201cWe need to make sure the product is right.\u201d",
      "Coleman said it can take two or three years to shift a product from an artificial color to a natural one. PepsiCo has to identify a natural ingredient that will have a stable shelf life and not change a product\u2019s flavor. Then it must ensure the availability of a safe and adequate supply. The company tests prototypes with trained experts and panels of consumers, then makes sure the new formula won\u2019t snag its manufacturing process. It also has to design new packaging.",
      "Tostitos and Lay\u2019s will be the first PepsiCo brands to make the shift, with naturally dyed tortilla and potato chips expected on store shelves later this year and naturally dyed dips due to be on sale early next year. Most of the chips, dips and salsas in the two lines already are naturally colored, but there were some exceptions.",
      "The reddish-brown tint of Tostitos Salsa Verde, for example, came from four synthetic colors: Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Red 40 and Blue 1. Coleman said the company is switching to carob powder, which gives the chips a similar color, but needed to tweak the recipe to ensure the addition of the cocoa alternative wouldn\u2019t affect the taste.",
      "In its Frito-Lay food labs and test kitchens in Plano, Texas, PepsiCo is experimenting with ingredients like paprika and turmeric to mimic the bright reds and oranges in products like Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos, Coleman said.",
      "The company is looking at purple sweet potatoes and various types of carrots to color drinks like Mountain Dew and Cherry 7Up, according to Damien Browne, the vice president of research and development for PepsiCo\u2019s beverage division based in Valhalla, New York.",
      "Getting the hue right is critical, since many consumers know products like Gatorade by their color and not necessarily their name, Browne said.",
      "\u201cWe eat with our eyes,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at a plate of food, it\u2019s generally the different kinds of colors that will tell you what you would like or not.\u201d",
      "When the Pepsi-Cola Company was founded in 1902, the absence of artificial dyes was a point of pride. The company marketed Pepsi as \u201cThe Original Pure Food Drink\u201d to differentiate the cola from rivals that used lead, arsenic and other toxins as food colorants before the U.S. banned them in 1906.",
      "But synthetic dyes eventually won over food companies. They were vibrant, consistent and cheaper than natural colors. They are also rigorously tested by the FDA.",
      "Still, PepsiCo said it started seeing a small segment of shoppers asking for products without artificial colors or flavors more than two decades ago. In 2002, it launched its Simply line of chips, which offer natural versions of products like Doritos. A dye-free organic Gatorade came out in 2016.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking for those little signals that will become humongous in the future,\u201d Amanda Grzeda, PepsiCo\u2019s senior director of global sensory and consumer experience, said of the company's close attention to consumer preferences.",
      "Grzeda said the whisper PepsiCo detected in the early 2000s has become a roar, fueled by social media and growing consumer interest in ingredients. More than half of the consumers PepsiCo spoke to for a recent internal study said they were trying to reduce their consumption of artificial dyes, Grzeda said.",

      "\u201cConsumers are definitely leading, and I think what we need to do is have the regulators catching up, allowing us to approve new natural ingredients to be able to meet their demand,\u201d he said.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said it's expediting approval of natural additives after calling on companies to halt their use of synthetic dyes. In May, the FDA approved three new natural color additives, including a blue color derived from algae. In July, the agency approved gardenia blue, which is derived from a flowering evergreen.",
      "The FDA banned one petroleum-based dye, Red 3, in January because it was shown to cause cancer in lab rats. And in September, the agency proposed a ban on Orange B, a synthetic color that hasn't been used in decades.",
      "Six synthetic dyes remain FDA-approved and widely used, despite mixed studies that show they may cause neurobehavioral problems in some children. Red 40, for example, is used in 25,965 food and beverage items on U.S. store shelves, according to the market research firm NIQ.",
      "But even if decades of research has shown that synthetic colors are safe, PepsiCo has to weigh public perceptions, Grzeda said.",
      "\u201cWe could just blindly follow the science, but it probably would put us at odds with what our consumers believe and perceive in the world,\u201d she said.",
      "PepsiCo also has to balance the needs of consumers who don\u2019t want their favorite snacks and drinks to change or get more expensive because of the costs of natural dyes. NIQ data shows that unit sales of products advertised as free of artificial colors fell sharply in 2023 as prices rose.",
      "Susan Mazur-Stommen, a small business owner in Hinton, West Virginia, picked up some Simply brand Cheetos Puffs recently at a convenience store because they were the only variety available.

      "Mazur-Stommen said she agrees with the move away from petroleum-based dyes, but it\u2019s not a critical issue for her.",
      "\u201cWhat I am looking for is the original formulation,\u201d she said.",

      "Hopes for a quick end to the government shutdown are fading",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Hopes for a quick end to the government shutdown were fading Friday as Republicans and Democrats dug in for a prolonged fight and President Donald Trump readied plans to unleash layoffs and cuts across the federal government.",
      "Senators were headed back to the Capitol for another vote on government funding on the third day of the shutdown, but there has been no sign of any real progress toward ending their standoff. Democrats are demanding that Congress extend health care benefits, while Republicans are trying to wear them down with day after day of voting on a House-passed bill that would reopen the government temporarily, mostly at current spending levels.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how many times you\u2019re going to give them a chance to vote no,\u201d Senate Majority Leader John Thune said at a news conference Friday. He added that he would give Democratic senators the weekend to think it over.",
      "Although Republicans control the White House and both chambers of Congress, the Senate's filibuster rules make it necessary for the government funding legislation to gain support from at least 60 of the 100 senators. That's given Democrats a rare opportunity to use their 47 Senate seats to hold out in exchange for policy concessions. The party has chosen to rally on the issue of health care, believing it could be key to their path back to power in Washington.",
      "Their primary demand is that Congress extend tax credits that were boosted during the COVID-19 pandemic for health care plans offered under the Affordable Care Act marketplace.",
      "Standing on the steps of the U.S. Capitol on Thursday, House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said, \u201cUnderstand this, over the last few days and over the next few days, what you\u2019re going to see is more than 20 million Americans experience dramatically increased health care premiums, co-pays and deductibles because of the Republican unwillingness to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits.\u201d",
      "Democrats are running the high-risk strategy of effectively voting for a government shutdown to make their stand. Trump has vowed to make it as painful as possible for them.",
      "The Republican president has called the government funding lapse an \u201cunprecedented opportunity\u201d to make vast cuts to federal agencies and potentially lay off federal workers, rather than the typical practice of furloughing them. White House budget director Russ Vought has already announced that he is withholding billions of dollars for infrastructure projects in states with Democratic senators.",
      "On Friday morning, Vought said he would withhold another $2.1 billion for Chicago infrastructure projects to extend its train system to the city's South Side.",
      "Jeffries has displayed no signs of budging under those threats.",
      "\u201cThe cruelty that they might unleash on everyday Americans using the pretense of a shutdown is only going to backfire against them,\u201d he said during an interview with The Associated Press and other outlets at the Capitol.",
      "Still, the shutdown, no matter how long it lasts, could have far-reaching effects on the economy. Roughly 750,000 federal employees could be furloughed, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, and they could lose out on $400 million in daily wages. That loss in wages until after the government reopens could drive down wider demand for goods and services.",

      "The American public usually spreads the blame around to both major political parties when it comes to a government shutdown. While Trump took a significant portion of the blame during the last partial government shutdown in 2018 as he demanded funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall, this standoff could end differently because now it is Democrats making the policy demands.",
      "Still, lawmakers were relentlessly trying to make their case to the American public with a constant beat of news conferences, social media videos and livestreams. Congressional leaders have been especially active.",
      "Both sides expressed confidence that the other would ultimately be found at fault. And in the House, party leaders seemed to be moving farther apart rather than closer to making a deal to end the shutdown.",
      "Jeffries on Thursday called for a permanent extension to the ACA tax credits. Meanwhile, Johnson and Thune told reporters that they would not negotiate on the tax credits until the government is reopened.",
      "A few senators have engaged in bipartisan talks about launching negotiations on extending the ACA tax credits for one year while the Senate votes to reopen the government for several weeks. But those discussions are in their early stages and appear to have little involvement from leadership.",
      "As senators prepared for their last scheduled vote for the week on Friday, they appeared resigned to allow the shutdown to continue at least into next week. Thune said that if the vote failed, he would \u201cgive them the weekend to think about it\u201d before holding more votes.",
      "Sen. Amy Klobuchar, in a floor speech, called for Republicans to work with her and fellow Democrats to find \u201ccommon ground\u201d on the ACA subsidies, saying their expiration would impact plenty of people in states with GOP senators \u2014 especially in rural areas where farmers, ranchers and small business owners purchase their own health insurance.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, right now our Republican colleagues are not working with us to find a bipartisan agreement to prevent the government shutdown and address the health care crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know that even when they float ideas \u2014 which we surely do appreciate \u2014 in the end the president appears to make the call.\u201d",

      "In the bill sent to Congress in March, Lula\u2019s leftist government proposed to offset the loss of state revenue by introducing a minimum effective tax rate for high-income individuals \u2014 a tax that must be paid regardless of the amount of deductions and credits the taxpayer might have.",
      "The new minimum effective tax would apply to people who earn over 600,000 reais (approximately $113,000) a year, ramping up from zero to 10% for those who earn over 1,200,000 reais (some $226,000) annually.",

      "The unanimous support for the bill in the lower house \u2014 despite Lula's coalition lacking a majority in the chamber \u2014 reflects the broad public support for the tax exemption and the lack of a coherent opposition to Lula's administration.",
      "Lula is expected to run for reelection next year.",

      "PARIS -- Military regalia met bohemian ease at Enfants Riches D\u00e9prim\u00e9s on Thursday, where designer Henri Alexander Levy once again proved his penchant for contradictions.",
      "A military-looking, shiny-buttoned denim coat, cut with the sharpness of uniform, was paired with \u201970s heeled boots and a model\u2019s shaggy, Woodstock hair. It was counterculture refracted through bourgeois tailoring.",
      "The edgy reputation of the house \u2014 whose name translates as \u201cDepressed Rich Kids\u201d \u2014 was intact. Levy gave Hedi Slimane-like preppy neckties a decadent twist with silver clasps and jeweled belts. White, wide pleated pants, almost aristocratic in their French country-house languor, turned rakish when topped with black leather and shades \u2014 the rich kid rolling back to family lunch after a lost weekend.",
      "Founded in 2012 in Los Angeles, ERD has grown beyond its cult beginnings, now anchoring a presence in Paris and even opening an art-book-and-vinyl bar. The label\u2019s cult status has also translated into a devoted celebrity following, with Jared Leto, Miley Cyrus, Courtney Love and Rita Ora among those spotted in its anarchic designs.",

      "The average rate on a 30-year U.S. mortgage ticked up for the second straight week following a string of declines that had brought down home borrowing costs to the lowest level in nearly a year",
      "WASHINGTON -- The average rate on a 30-year U.S. mortgage ticked up for the second straight week following a string of declines that had brought down home borrowing costs to their lowest level in nearly a year.",
      "The average long-term mortgage rate rose this week to 6.34% from 6.3% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, the rate averaged 6.12%.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors\u2019 expectations for the economy and inflation. They generally follow the trajectory of the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.",
      "The 10-year yield was at 4.10% at midday Thursday, down from 4.19% the same time last week. Much of that decline has come in the past few days, driven by discouraging reports on the U.S. economy, particularly the job market.",
      "In late July, mortgage rates started declining in the lead-up to the Federal Reserve\u2019s widely anticipated decision last month to cut its main interest rate for the first time in a year amid growing concern over the U.S. job market.",
      "However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has since signaled a cautious approach to future interest rate cuts. That\u2019s in sharp contrast with other members of the Fed\u2019s rate-setting committee, particularly those who were appointed by President Donald Trump, who are pushing for faster cuts.",
      "The housing market has been in a slump since 2022, when mortgage rates began climbing from historic lows. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes sank last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years. So far this year, sales are running below where they were at this time in 2024.",

      "The second straight bump in rates could signal a repeat of what happened last year after the Fed cut its benchmark rate for the first time in more than four years. Back then, mortgage rates fell for several weeks prior to the Fed\u2019s September rate cut. In the following weeks however, mortgage rates began rising again, eventually reaching just above 7% in mid-January this year.",
      "Like last year, the Fed\u2019s rate cut doesn\u2019t necessarily mean mortgage rates will keep declining, even as the central bank signals more cuts ahead.",
      "Still, the late-summer decline in mortgage rates has already encouraged many homeowners who bought in recent years after rates climbed well above 6% to refinance to a lower rate.",
      "Mortgage rates will have to sink below 6% to make refinancing an attractive option to a broader swath of homeowners, however. That\u2019s because about 81% of U.S. homes have a mortgage with a rate of 6% or lower, according to Realtor.com.",
      "Economists generally forecast the average rate on a 30-year mortgage to remain near the mid-6% range this year.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, also inched up this week. The average rate rose to 5.55% from 5.49% the previous week. A year ago, it was 5.25%, Freddie Mac said.",

      "French authorities have announced the captain of an oil tanker linked to Russia's shadow fleet will face trial in February",
      "PARIS -- The captain of an oil tanker immobilized off the country\u2019s Atlantic coast which President Emmanuel Macron linked to Russia will go on trial in February over the crew's alleged refusal to cooperate, a French prosecutor said Thursday.",
      "Macron has alleged that the tanker belongs to Russia\u2019s so-called shadow fleet of aging tankers of uncertain ownership that are avoiding Western sanctions over Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine and didn't rule out that it could have been involved in drone flights over Denmark as it was sailing last week off the coast of the Nordic country.",
      "Asked about whether the tanker could be linked to drones flights, Macron said that \u201cI\u2019m very cautious because our services and our justice are still working ... I don\u2019t exclude it at all, but I cannot here attribute very clearly and establish a clear link between these two phenomenon.\u201d",
      "Speaking at a European summit in Copenhagen, Denmark, Macron said that the French navy faced \u201cinappropriate and extremely aggressive behavior\u201d towards the French frigate and helicopters that had been deployed to board the taker, which justified the opening of a judicial investigation.",
      "St\u00e9phane Kellenberger, prosecutor of the western port city of Brest, said that two Chinese crew members, the captain and the chief mate, who had been detained since Tuesday, were released from police custody. The chief mate has been released without charge.",
      "A preliminary investigation was opened into the crew\u2019s \u201crefusal to cooperate\u201d and \u201cfailure to justify the nationality of the vessel\u201d after the Atlantic Maritime Prefect alerted justice authorities Monday, Kellenberger said. The inquiry showed the captain couldn't be directly considered responsible for the second offense, he added.",
      "Kellenberger said that members of the French navy intervened and boarded the ship on Saturday off France's Atlantic coast in line with international law when there appeared to be a discrepancy between its apparent nationality and real nationality.",
      "An investigation led by the French navy concluded that the ship, coming from Russia and heading to India with a \u201clarge oil shipment,\u201d was flying no flag, he said.",
      "The captain was summoned for trial in Brest on Feb. 23. He faces up to one year in prison and a 150,000-euro ($176,000) fine.",
      "French military spokesman Col. Guillaume Vernet said that the ship was ordered to stay in place in a safe area.",
      "In comments earlier Thursday in Copenhagen, Macron praised the work of the French navy to \u201cidentify the presence of a shadow fleet.\"",

At the time, Prime Minister Kristen Michal posted on social media that Estonia\u2019s navy had \u201cdetained a sanctioned vessel with no flag state\u201d and authorities had boarded the ship -- without specifying.",
      "The ship, now known as \u201cPushpa\u201d or \u201cBoracay,\u201d left the Russian oil terminal in Primorsk near St. Petersburg on Sept. 20, and sailed off the coast of Denmark. It has stayed off the coast of the French western port of Saint-Nazaire since Sunday, according to the Marine Traffic monitoring website.",
      "The tanker, whose name has changed several times, was sailing under the flag of Benin and appears on a list of ships targeted by European Union sanctions against Russia.",

      "Officials say two Delta Air Lines regional jets collided on the taxiway at LaGuardia Airport in New York, injuring a flight attendant",
      "Two Delta Air Lines regional jets collided on the taxiway at LaGuardia Airport in New York, injuring a flight attendant, damaging a cockpit and tearing off part of a wing in what the airline described as a \u201clow-speed collision.\u201d",
      "An aircraft carrying 32 people was preparing for takeoff Wednesday night to Roanoke, Virginia, when its wing made contact with the fuselage of an aircraft arriving from Charlotte, North Carolina, with 61 people aboard, according to a statement from Delta.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear who was at fault, but air traffic control had instructed the Virginia-bound plane \u201cto hold short and yield to the other aircraft\u201d before the collision, the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement.",
      "A flight attendant was taken to a hospital, according to a statement from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. One of the pilots told the tower that the flight attendant told him she hit her knee when the planes collided, according to audio that www.LiveATC.net posted. There were no reports of passengers injured, the airline said.",
      "\u201cTheir right wing clipped our nose and the cockpit. We have damage to our windscreen and ... some of our screens in here,\u201d a pilot said, according to the air traffic control audio.",
      "Images of the damage showed the broken wing on one plane while the other plane's cockpit window was shattered and its nose was deeply gouged in several places.",
      "The plane that had landed \u201cstopped, jerked, and jumped to the right,\u201d passenger William Lusk told ABC. \u201dEveryone went dead silent. And as everyone went dead silent, the pilot calmly came on and said, \u2018Hey, we've been in a crash, everyone remain calm.'\"",
      "Close calls like this could add to worries about aviation safety in the wake of recent crashes and near misses including the deadliest plane crash in the United States in decades, when an Army helicopter collided with an airliner preparing to land at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.",
      "Former NTSB and FAA crash investigator Jeff Guzzetti said that the ground controller lines up planes on taxiways and directs them where to go, but the pilots are expected to avoid other planes as they move at slow speeds while controllers focus on keeping the runways clear.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to have situational awareness about where your wings are poking out at and what they could hit as you\u2019re taxiing,\u201d said Guzzetti, who is now an aviation safety consultant. \u201cThey (controllers) expect the flight crews to see each other since they\u2019re taxiing at a slow speed. And the controller's main function is to make sure the runway is clear for takeoff and landings.\u201d",
      "Because this happened at night and planes typically turn off their nose lights while taxiing, it may have been more difficult for the pilots to see exactly where the other plane was, Guzzetti said. A plane's taxi lights are on the wings. The landing lights are used to improve visibility and help make sure other pilots can see the plane, but the FAA encourages pilots to be careful not to blind other pilots because landing lights can also impair night vision.",

      "Intrusions into NATO\u2019s airspace, some of them blamed on Russia, reached an unprecedented scale last month. Some European officials described the incidents as Moscow testing NATO\u2019s response, which raised questions about how prepared the alliance is against Russia.",
      "On Sept. 10, a swarm of Russian drones flew into Poland's airspace, forcing NATO aircraft to scramble to intercept them and shoot down some of the devices. It was the first direct encounter between NATO and Moscow since Russia launched its all-out war on Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "Days later, NATO jets escorted three Russian warplanes out of Estonia\u2019s airspace.",
      "Since then, flyovers have occurred near airports, military installations and critical infrastructure, among other locations, elsewhere on the continent and prompted European defense ministers to agree to develop a \u201cdrone wall\u201d along their borders to better detect, track and intercept drones violating Europe\u2019s airspace.",
      "Russia has been blamed for some of them, but denies that anything was done on purpose or that it played a role. European authorities haven't released much detail about the drone intrusions, with some not acknowledging the overflights publicly until days later.",
      "Other times, authorities were unable to confirm a report of a sighting. At one point, Danish authorities were flooded with 500 tips of sightings over 24 hours \u2014 some of which turned out to be just stars in the sky.",
      "Countries are scrambling to figure out how to respond in the moment, including weighing whether to allow authorities to shoot the drones down.",
      "Here's what we know about some of the recent drone sightings:",

      "The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, said the H-1B program is a critical pathway to hiring healthcare workers and educators. It drives innovation and economic growth in the U.S., and allows employers to fill jobs in specialized fields, the lawsuit said.",

      "In voting for the takeover of Duluth-based Minnesota, the five members of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission said they believe the conditions imposed on the deal will protect the public interest and shield customers from rate increases.

      "Former Cisco Systems CEO John Chambers learned all about technology\u2019s volatile highs and lows as a veteran of the internet\u2019s early boom days during the late 1990s and the ensuing meltdown that followed the mania",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Former Cisco Systems CEO John Chambers learned all about technology's volatile highs and lows as a veteran of the internet's early boom days during the late 1990s and the ensuing meltdown that followed the mania.",
      "And now he is seeing potential signs of the cycle repeating with another transformative technology as a whirlwind of investments and excitement about artificial intelligence has propelled the stock market to new highs.",
      "Chambers took a similarly meteoric ride in his early days running Cisco, which had a market value of about $15 billion in 1995, when networking equipment suddenly became must-have components for the buildup of the internet. The feverish demand briefly turned the firm into the world's most valuable company \u2014 worth $550 billion in March 2000 \u2014 before the investment bubble burst. The crash caused Cisco's stock price to plunge more than 80% during a period that Chambers still recalls as the worst of his career.",
      "Cisco bounced back to deliver consistent financial growth to help establish Chambers as one of Silicon Valley's most respected leaders before he stepped down as CEO in 2015, but company's stock price has never approached the peak it reached a quarter century ago.",
      "While remaining Cisco's chairman emeritus, Chambers is now as fascinated by the AI's transformative powers as he once was by the internet revolution. Only this time he is advising CEOs as a venture capitalist investing in AI startups rather than running a company himself. Chambers, 76, recently discussed the promise and perils of the AI boom with The Associated Press. The interview has been edited for clarity.",
      "Q: Does the current AI mania remind you of the internet boom of the 1990s?",
      "A: Absolutely. There are a lot of parallels but there are also some spectacular differences. AI is moving at five times the speed and will produce three times the outcomes of the internet age. In the internet age, a startup would develop products for two years and then in year three, they would take that out into the market. Today, AI startups develop the product in a month and sometimes in a week, and then they bring it to market in one or two quarters.",
      "In the internet age, there was an irrational exuberance on a really large scale. In this AI one, there is a lot of tremendous optimism that does indicate a future bubble for certain companies. Is there going to be train wreck? Yes, for those that aren\u2019t able to translate the technology into a sustainable competitive advantage, how are you going to generate revenue after all the money you poured into it?",
      "Q: Do you think AI is going to eliminate a lot of jobs?",
      "A: It happened with the internet. The problem this time is that if I am right about AI moving at five times the speed of the internet, we are going to destroy jobs faster than we can replace them. Will we be able to replace them over time? Yes, but there is going to be a drought while we have to re-educate lots of people.",

If companies start making more money, they are either going to increase the dividend or invest in new areas. Hopefully, the majority will invest in new areas to create new jobs.",
      "You will see successful companies expand and grow dramatically, but you are probably going to see 50% of the Fortune 500 companies disappear and 50% of the executives of the Fortune 500 disappear. They won\u2019t have the skills to adjust to this new innovation economy driven by AI because they were trained in silos they were trained to move at the speed of a five-year cycle as opposed to a 12-month cycle.",
      "Q: Do you think this is one of the most uncertain times you have ever seen?",
      "A: It\u2019s the most uncertain time on a global basis, ever. I would argue that this is the new normal. With the speed the market is moving at now, you have to be able to reinvent yourself, which most CEOs and business leaders don\u2019t know how to do, especially with AI.",
      "Q: What\u2019s your view of how Big Tech has been working with President Donald Trump during his second term in office?",
      "A: Let\u2019s be realistic. Silicon Valley moved right, there shouldn\u2019t be any doubt. They did it for economic reasons. And practicality, they did it for their shareholders but also regulation was getting out of control. They weren\u2019t able to grow and China was plainly beating us.",
      "Q: How worried are you about China?",
      "A: I think China has full intention to win at the U.S.\u2019s expense. In China, there are no rules, there is no intellectual property, there are no issues about misusing the power. They intend to blow past militarily, economically, and in every other way. I do not view them as a partner, I view them as a serious competitor on all fronts and someone I don\u2019t trust. I think over time people are going to recognize it\u2019s in the U.S.\u2019s best interest and it\u2019s in China\u2019s best interest for us to get along. So go out 10 years, and that\u2019s the most likely outcome. But I think the next five years are going to be really bumpy and dangerous. We should have no illusions that they intend to crush us.",

She sent back a handwritten letter and told me it will be hard, but I should try,\u201d Crockford said. \u201cFor me, she gave me my career.\u201d",
      "Goodall was one of three pioneering young women studying great apes in the 1960s and 1970s who began to revolutionize the way people understood just what was -- and wasn\u2019t -- unique about our own species. Sometimes called the \u201cTri-mates,\u201d Goodall, Dian Fossey and Birut\u00e9 Galdikas spent years documenting the intimate lives of chimpanzees in Tanzania, mountain gorillas in Rwanda, and orangutans in Indonesia, respectively.",
      "The projects they began have produced some of the longest-running studies about animal behavior in the world that are crucial to understanding such long-lived species. \u201cThese animals are like us, slow to mature and reproduce, and living for decades. We are still learning new things about them,\u201d said Tara Stoinski, a primatologist and president of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund. \u201cJane and Dian knew each other and learned from each other, and the scientists who continued their work continue to collaborate today.\u201d",
      "Goodall studied chimpanzees \u2014 as a species and as individuals. And she named them: David Greybeard, Flo, Fifi, Goliath. That was highly unconventional at the time, but Goodall\u2019s attention to individuals created space for scientists to observe and record differences in individual behaviors, preferences and even emotions.",
      "Catherine Hobaiter, a primatologist at St. Andrews University who was inspired by Goodall, recalled how Goodall carefully combined empathy and objectivity. Goodall liked to use a particular phrase, \u201cIf they were human, we would describe them as happy,\u201d or \u201cIf they were human, we would describe them as friends \u2013- these two individuals together,\u201d Hobaiter said. Goodall didn\u2019t project precise feelings onto the chimpanzees, but nor did she deny the capacity of animals besides humans to have emotional lives.",
      "Goodall and her frequent collaborator, evolutionary biologist Marc Bekoff, had just finished the text of a forthcoming children's book, called \u201cEvery Elephant Has a Name,\u201d which will be published around early 2027.",
      "From the late 1980s until her death, Goodall spent less time in the field and more time on the road talking to students, teachers, diplomats, park rangers, presidents and many others around the world. She inspired countless others through her books. Her mission was to inspire action to protect the natural world.",
      "In 1991, she founded an organization called Roots & Shoots that grew to include chapters of young people in dozens of countries.",
      "Stuart Pimm, a Duke University ecologist and founder of the nonprofit Saving Nature, recalled when he and Goodall were invited to speak to a congressional hearing about deforestation and extinction. Down the marble halls of the government building, \u201cthere was a huge line of teenage girls and their mothers just waiting to get inside the room to hear Jane speak,\u201d Pimm said Thursday. \u201cShe was mobbed everywhere she went -- she was just this incredible inspiration to people in general, particularly to young women.\u201d",
      "Goodall wanted everyone to find their voice, no matter their age or station, said Zanagee Artis, co-founder of the youth climate movement Zero Hour. \u201cI really appreciated how much Jane valued young people being in the room -- she really fostered intergenerational movement building,\u201d said Artis, who now works for the Natural Resources Defense Council.",

      "That includes Goodall\u2019s son and three grandchildren, who are an important part of the work of the Jane Goodall Institute and in their own endeavors, said Mary Lewis, a vice president at the institute who began working with the famed primatologist in 1990.",

In this vineyard about a 90-minute drive east of Lisbon, the cool autumn night carries the smell of ripe fruit. The workers' laughter blends with the sound of rustling leaves.",
      "The night harvest is a time-honored practice in viticulture, meant to preserve the freshness of grapes and shield them from the adverse effects of daytime heat, sunlight and oxidation. As summers in Portugal grow longer, hotter and more unpredictable \u2014 in part due to climate change \u2014 the practice has become more common here.",
      "B\u00e1rbara Monteiro, co-owner and manager of the Herdade Da Fonte Santa vineyard said she struggled at first to convince her harvesters to work at night \u2014 midnight to 8 a.m. They began doing so in 2019.",

      "The wine harvest in Spain, Italy and Portugal generally takes place between late August and October, with variations based on the region, type of grapes and weather conditions.",
      "Some vineyards have been harvesting at night for years. In parts of Italy, others have for more than a decade. The El Coto de Rioja vineyard in Spain\u2019s famed La Rioja region opts for early morning harvests, beginning at 5 or 6 a.m., according to C\u00e9sar Fern\u00e1ndez, the vineyard's technical director and winemaker.",

      "Grapes are naturally sensitive to temperature shifts. Warmer weather can make them reach sugar maturity before developing a full flavor and ripeness, leading to higher alcohol levels but less complex wines. Intense heat also speeds up acid loss and can trigger early fermentation as wild yeasts and bacteria become more active.",
      "By harvesting at night, vintners can lock in more vibrant flavors that improve the quality of the wine produced.",

      "AOL previously confirmed it would be pulling the plug on Tuesday (Sept. 30) \u2014 writing in a brief update on its support site last month that it \u201croutinely evaluates\" its offerings and had decided to discontinue dial-up, as well as associated software \u201coptimized for older operating systems,\u201d from its plans.",

      "Before it was America Online, AOL was founded as Quantum Computer Services in 1985. It soon rebranded and hit the public market in 1991. Near the height of the dot-com boom, AOL's market value reached nearly $164 billion in 2000. But tumultuous years followed, and that valuation plummeted as the once-tech pioneer bounced between multiple owners.

      "GENEVA -- Switzerland's glaciers have faced \u201cenormous\u201d melting this year with a 3% drop in total volume \u2014 the fourth-largest annual drop on record \u2014 due to the effects of global warming, top Swiss glaciologists reported Wednesday.",
      "The shrinkage this year means that ice mass in Switzerland \u2014 home to the most glaciers in Europe \u2014 has declined by one-quarter over the last decade, the Swiss glacier monitoring group GLAMOS and the Swiss Academy of Sciences said in their report.",
      "\u201cGlacial melting in Switzerland was once again enormous in 2025,\" the scientists said. \u201cA winter with low snow depth combined with heat waves in June and August led to a loss of 3% of the glacier volume.\u201d",
      "Switzerland is home to nearly 1,400 glaciers, the most of any country in Europe, and the ice mass and its gradual melting have implications for hydropower, tourism, farming and water resources in many European countries.",
      "More than 1,000 small glaciers in Switzerland have already disappeared, the experts said.",
      "The teams reported that a winter with little snow was followed by heat waves in June \u2014 the second-warmest June on record \u2014 which left the snow reserves depleted by early July. Ice masses began to melt earlier than ever, they said.",
      "\u201cGlaciers are clearly retreating because of anthropogenic global warming,\u201d said Matthias Huss, the head of GLAMOS, referring to climate change caused by human activity.",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Scientists have uncovered new types of organics in icy geysers spouting from Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus, bolstering the likelihood that the ocean world may harbor conditions suitable for life.",
      "Their findings, reported Wednesday, are based on observations made by NASA\u2019s Cassini spacecraft in 2008 during a close and fast flyby of Enceladus. The small moon, one of 274 orbiting Saturn, has long been considered a prime candidate in the search for life beyond Earth because of its hidden ocean and plumes of water erupting from cracks near its south pole.",
      "While Enceladus may be habitable, no one is suggesting that life exists.",
      "\u201cBeing habitable and being inhabited are two very different things. We believe that Enceladus is habitable, but we do not know if life is indeed present,\" said the University of Washington's Fabian Klenner, who took part in the study.",
      "An international team decided to launch a fresh analysis of tiny grains of ice encountered as Cassini flew through the moon's geysers. The grains were young compared with the much older geyser particles that ended up in one of Saturn\u2019s outermost rings.",
      "These new grains collided with Cassini\u2019s cosmic dust analyzer at 40,000 mph (64,800 kph), faster than the old ones. The increased speed provided a clearer view of the chemical compounds present, the scientists noted.",
      "Organic molecules already had been spotted in the old geyser grains, but their age raised questions as to whether they had been altered over the years by space radiation.",
      "Scientists found some of the same molecules in the fresh grains, confirming they came from the moon\u2019s underground sea, as well as new chemical compounds. The findings were published in Nature Astronomy.",
      "An ice-encapsulated water world barely 310 miles (500 kilometers) across with a rocky core, Enceladus is suspected of having hydrothermal vents on its ocean floor, quite possibly like those in the Arctic. The moon's jets of water vapor and frozen particles can stretch thousands of miles (kilometers) into space.",
      "\u201cWe are confident that these molecules originate from the subsurface ocean of Enceladus, enhancing its habitability potential,\" the Free University of Berlin\u2019s Nozair Khawaja, the lead author, said in an email.",
      "The scientists favor new missions to further explore Enceladus. Launched in 1997, Cassini is long gone; the spacecraft was deliberately plunged into Saturn in 2017 following its joint mission by NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency.",

      "NEW YORK -- Researchers have discovered life-size rock carvings of camels, gazelles and other animals in the Saudi Arabian desert.",
      "The carvings date back to around 12,000 years ago and many are over 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall. Scientists say they were created using a wedge-shaped rock to create sharp lines.",
      "Several were etched on narrow ledges so the artists couldn't even step back to survey the final product as they were working.",

      "The animal carvings and engraving tools found at the site show that people were living in the area about 2,000 years earlier than scientists thought. It isn't clear how they survived in such arid conditions \u2014 whether they lived off of shallow lakes that pooled for part of the year or drank water that accumulated in deep crevices.",
      "People have been creating rock art in Saudi Arabia for thousands of years, Guagnin said. But older engravings can be tricky to date since they tend not to feature writing and there are few remnants such as charcoal, which can be sent to a lab for analysis.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists warn that \u201cflying rivers\u201d \u2014 invisible streams of moisture that carry rain from the Atlantic Ocean westward across the Amazon \u2014 are weakening as deforestation and climate change advance",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Droughts have withered crops in Peru, fires have scorched the Amazon and hydroelectric dams in Ecuador have struggled to keep the lights on as rivers dry up. Scientists say the cause may lie high above the rainforest, where invisible \u201cflying rivers\u201d carry rain from the Atlantic Ocean across South America.",
      "New analysis warns that relentless deforestation is disrupting that water flow and suggests that continuing tree loss will worsen droughts in the southwestern Amazon and could eventually trigger those regions to shift from rainforest to drier savanna \u2014 grassland with far fewer trees.",
      "\u201cThese are the forces that actually create and sustain the Amazon rainforest,\u201d said Matt Finer, a senior researcher with Amazon Conservation\u2019s Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project (MAAP), which tracks deforestation and climate threats across the basin and carried out the analysis.",
      "\u201cIf you break that pump by cutting down too much forest, the rains stop reaching where they need to go.\u201d",
      "Most of the Amazon\u2019s rainfall starts over the Atlantic Ocean. Moist air is pushed inland by steady winds that blow west along the equator, known as the trade winds. The forest then acts like a pump, effectively relaying the water thousands of miles westward as the trees absorb water, then release it back into the air.",
      "Brazilian climate scientist Carlos Nobre was among the early researchers who calculated how much of the water vapor from the Atlantic would move through and eventually out of the Amazon basin. He and colleagues coined the \u201cflying rivers\u201d term at a 2006 scientific meeting, and interest grew as scientists warned that a weakening of the rivers could push the Amazon into a tipping point where rainforest would turn to savanna.",
      "That's important because the Amazon rainforest is a vast storehouse for the carbon dioxide that largely drives the world's warming. Such a shift would devastate wildlife and Indigenous communities and threaten farming, water supplies and weather stability far beyond the region.",
      "The analysis by Finer's group found that southern Peru and northern Bolivia are especially vulnerable. During the dry season, flying rivers sweep across southern Brazil before reaching the Andes \u2014 precisely where deforestation is most intense. The loss of trees means less water vapor is carried westward, raising the risk of drought in iconic protected areas such as Peru\u2019s Manu National Park.",
      "\u201cPeru can do everything right to protect a place like Manu,\u201d Finer said. \u201cBut if deforestation keeps cutting into the pump in Brazil, the rains that sustain it may never arrive.\u201d",
      "Nobre said as much as 50% of rainfall in the western Amazon near the Andes depends on the flying rivers.",
      "Corine Vriesendorp, Amazon Conservation\u2019s director of science based in Cusco, Peru, said the changes are already visible.",
      "\u201cThe last two years have brought the driest conditions the Amazon has ever seen,\u201d Vriesendorp said. \u201cEcological calendars that Indigenous communities use \u2014 when to plant, when to fish, when animals reproduce \u2014 are increasingly out of sync. Having less and more unpredictable rain will have an even bigger impact on their lives than climate change is already having.\u201d",
      "Farmers face failed harvests, Indigenous families struggle with disrupted fishing and hunting seasons and cities that rely on hydroelectric power see outages as the rivers that provide the power dry up.",
      "MAAP researchers found that rainfall patterns depend on when and where the flying rivers cross the basin. In the wet season, their northern route flows mostly over intact forests in Guyana, Suriname and northern Brazil, keeping the system strong.",

      "But in the dry season \u2014 when forests are already stressed by heat \u2014 the aerial rivers cut across southern Brazil, where deforestation fronts spread along highways and farms and there simply are fewer trees to help move the moisture along.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s during the dry months, when the forest most needs water, that the flying rivers are most disrupted,\u201d Finer said.",
      "Finer pointed to roads that can accelerate deforestation, noting that the controversial BR-319 highway in Brazil \u2014 a project to pave a road through one of the last intact parts of the southern Amazon \u2014 could create an entirely new deforestation front.",
      "For years, scientists have warned about the Amazon tipping toward savannah. Finer said the new study complicates that picture.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a single, all-at-once collapse,\u201d he said. \u201cCertain areas, like the southwest Amazon, are more vulnerable and will feel the impacts first. And we\u2019re already seeing early signs of rainfall reduction downwind of deforested areas.\u201d",
      "Nobre said the risks are stark. Amazon forests have already lost about 17% of their cover, mostly to cattle and soy. Those ecosystems recycle far less water.",
      "\u201cThe dry season is now five weeks longer than it was 45 years ago, with 20 to 30% less rainfall,\u201d he said. \u201cIf deforestation exceeds 20 to 25% and warming reaches 2 degrees Celsius, there\u2019s no way to prevent the Amazon from reaching the tipping point.\u201d",
      "Protecting intact forests, supporting Indigenous land rights and restoring deforested areas are the clearest paths forward, researchers say.",
      "\u201cTo avoid collapse we need zero deforestation, degradation and fires \u2014 immediately,\u201d Nobre said. \u201cAnd we must begin large-scale forest restoration, not less than half a million square kilometers. If we do that, and keep global warming below 2 degrees, we can still save the Amazon.\u201d",
      "Finer said governments should consider new conservation categories specifically designed to protect flying rivers \u2014 safeguarding not just land but the atmospheric flows that make the rainforest possible.",
      "For Vriesendorp, that means regional cooperation. She praised Peru for creating vast parks and Indigenous reserves in the southeast, including Manu National Park. But, she said, \u201cthis can\u2019t be solved by one country alone. Peru depends on Brazil, and Brazil depends on its neighbors. We need basin-wide solutions.\u201d",

      "Unaccompanied children are held in shelters run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which isn't part of ICE. Contreras' 2021 order instructed federal officials to release minors who turn 18 from those shelters to \u201cthe least restrictive setting available.\" He ruled that is what's required by federal law as long as the minor isn't a danger to themselves or others and isn't a flight risk.

      "But now, the iconic Burlington venue that fostered a community of diverse artists has closed its doors, despite negotiations to keep the music going.",
      "Nectar\u2019s announced it was taking a pause in June, citing \u201cimmense challenges affecting both downtown Burlington and the local live music and entertainment scene.\u201d Several weeks later, the venue announced on social media that it was closing for good. The post immediately drew hundreds of comments and tributes from musicians, former employees and fans.",

      "Farnsworth noted that the venue \u2014 a brick building with a neon sign \u2014 \u201cholds a very important place\u201d in Phish lore. The band's 1992 record was titled \u201cA Picture of Nectar\u201d as a tribute to the venue and to Rorris, who gave the fledgling band a residency for nearly two years.",
      "\u201cThe guys from Phish were very good to us,\u201d said Alex Budney, who started at Nectar\u2019s in 2001 as a cook when he was 19, making their famous gravy fries and later working almost every job in the building over 20 years.",
      "\u201cMy college band would play there on Monday nights and it would be like nobody there. But the keyboard player from Phish would come down in a snowstorm and sit at the bar and watch us play and talk to us,\u201d Budney said.",

      "Lithium-ion batteries are increasingly being used to store power for electrical grids, but some localities are concerned about fire risks",
      "More and more, big arrays of lithium-ion batteries are being hooked up to electrical grids around the U.S. to store power that can be discharged in times of high demand.",
      "But as more energy storage is added, residents in some places are pushing back due to fears that the systems will go up in flames, as a massive facility in California did earlier this year.",
      "Proponents maintain that state-of-the-art battery energy storage systems are safe, but more localities are enacting moratoriums.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not guinea pigs for anybody ... we are not going to experiment, we\u2019re not going to take risk,\u201d said Michael McGinty, the mayor of Island Park, New York, which passed a moratorium in July after a storage system was proposed near the village line.",
      "At least a few dozen localities around the United States have moved to temporarily block development of big battery systems in recent years.",
      "Long Island, where the power grid could get a boost in the next few years as offshore wind farms come online, has been a hotbed of activism, even drawing attention recently from the Trump administration. Opponents there got a boost in August when Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin visited New York to complain that the state was rushing approvals of sites in order to meet \u201cdelusional\u201d green power goals \u2014 a claim state officials deny.",
      "Battery energy storage systems that suck up cheap power during periods of low demand, then discharge it at a profit during periods of high demand, are considered critical with the rise of intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar.",
      "Known by the acronym BESS, the systems can make grids more reliable and have been credited with reducing blackouts. A large battery system might consist of rows of shipping containers in a fenced lot, with the containers holding hundreds of thousands of cells.",
      "China and the United States lead the world in rapidly adding battery storage energy systems. However, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Australia, Netherlands, Chile, Canada and the U.K. have commissioned or started construction on large projects since 2024, too, according to research from BloombergNEF.",
      "In the U.S., California and Texas have been leaders in battery storage. But other states are moving quickly, often with privately developed systems. While the Trump administration has been unsupportive or even hostile to renewable energy, key tax credits for energy storage projects were maintained in the recently approved federal budget for qualified projects that begin construction in the next eight years.",
      "Developers added 4,908 megawatts of battery storage capacity in the second quarter of 2025, with Arizona, California and Texas accounting for about three-quarters of that new capacity, according to a report from American Clean Power Association, an industry group. That\u2019s enough to power nearly 1.7 million households.",
      "New York has an ambitious goal to add 6,000 megawatts of energy storage by 2030, half of it large-scale systems.",
      "Opposition to the storage systems usually focuses on the possibility of thermal runaway, a chain reaction of uncontrolled heating that can lead to fire or an explosion. Opponents point to past fires and ask: What if that happens in my neighborhood?",
      "A battery storage system  in Moss Landing, California caught fire in January, sending plumes of toxic smoke into the atmosphere and forcing the evacuation of about 1,500 people..",
      "Experts in the field say battery systems have become safer over the years. Ofodike Ezekoye, a combustion expert and professor of mechanical engineering at The University of Texas at Austin, notes that failures are relatively infrequent, but also that no engineered system is 100% foolproof.",
      "\u201cThis is a relatively immature technology that is maturing quickly, so I think that there are a lot of really thoughtful researchers and other stakeholders who are trying to improve the overall safety of these systems,\u201d Ezekoye said.",

      "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is convening Saturday for its twice-annual general conference at a pivotal moment in its history",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- SALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is convening Saturday for its twice-annual general conference at a pivotal moment in its history: just days after the death of its oldest-ever president and a deadly attack on a congregation in Michigan.",
      "The death of President Russell M. Nelson leaves a void, but the church has a well-defined leadership hierarchy that helps ensure a smooth transition. Dallin H. Oaks, the man set to succeed Nelson, has already played a prominent role in church leadership as one of Nelson's two top counselors. Oaks' expected ascension to the presidency is likely to be announced after Nelson's funeral, scheduled for Tuesday, a couple of days after the conference when about 100,000 members gather at the church's headquarters in Utah.",
      "The 200-year-old denomination known widely as the Mormon church has not held a general conference without a president for at least a century, but there's no leadership vacuum, said Patrick Mason, a professor of religious studies and history at Utah State University.",
      "A governing body called the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, headed by Oaks, is leading the church and its more than 17 million members worldwide in the absence of a president, much like Brigham Young\u2019s role for more than two years following church founder Joseph Smith\u2019s death in 1844.",
      "In the 19th century, it was common for a couple years to pass before a new president was named. The Quorum again led the church for lengthy periods after Young's death in 1877 and John Taylor's death in 1887.",
      "The last time a church president died just before a general conference was in April 1951, with the death of George Albert Smith. His funeral was folded into the conference and a new president was formally announced during the gathering.",
      "Today, it is not uncommon for a living president to miss a conference for health reasons, especially given their ages. At 93, Oaks will be among the oldest presidents. Seven of the past nine have served into their nineties, including five beyond Oaks\u2019 current age. Nelson lived to be 101.",
      "Nelson's absence is expected to be felt as thousands gather in person this weekend and many more tune in remotely from around the world. The two-day conference features sermons and serves as a unifying time for the faith\u2019s global membership. Church officials often address major issues of the moment while leaving some room for members to interpret religious doctrine for themselves.",
      "\u201cI think Nelson\u2019s shadow will hang heavy over the conference,\u201d said Matthew Bowman, an expert on U.S. religious history at Claremont Graduate University.",
      "The president \u2014 considered a prophet by members \u2014 traditionally speaks at general conference, and it is considered an event highlight during which new initiatives and policies have been announced. Nelson often used the time to announce the construction of new temples, one of his main enterprises as president. He was charismatic, sentimental and frequently quoted by other conference speakers, which Bowman expects will continue this weekend as they honor his legacy.",
      "In addition to Nelson's death, the faithful have been reeling from the attack on one of their congregations in Michigan last weekend. Four people were killed inside a church in Grand Blanc Township after a gunman rammed his pickup truck into the house of worship, shot at congregants and set a fire that destroyed a lot of the building. The gunman, who was killed by police, was described by friends as having a grudge against the church.",

He has been a driving force in the church against same-sex marriage and in upholding a teaching that homosexuality is a sin, creating anxiety among LGBTQ+ members and their allies.",
      "Oaks also has been outspoken about maintaining civil discourse and denouncing violence, which could again be a focus this weekend.",
      "\u201cEven before the recent shooting, I would not have been surprised to see him address either issues of religious freedom or of civility,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cBut now, given the new responsibilities approaching him, I might expect him to take a longer view and speak to more broad issues of Christianity, eternity and so on.\"",

      "A federal appeals court in Boston has ruled the Trump administration cannot withhold citizenship from children born to people in the country illegally or temporarily",
      "BOSTON -- BOSTON (AP) \u2014 A federal appeals court in Boston ruled on Friday that the Trump administration cannot withhold citizenship from children born to people in the country illegally or temporarily, adding to the mounting legal setbacks for the president\u2019s birthright order.",
      "A three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals became the fifth federal court since June to either issue or uphold orders blocking the president\u2019s birthright order. The court concluded that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claims that the children described in the order are entitled to birthright citizenship under the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment.",
      "The panel upheld lower courts' preliminary injunctions, which blocked the birthright order while lawsuits challenging it moved ahead. The order, signed the day the president took office in January, would halt automatic citizenship for babies born to people in the U.S. illegally or temporarily.",
      "\u201cThe \u2018lessons of history\u2019 thus give us every reason to be wary of now blessing this most recent effort to break with our established tradition of recognizing birthright citizenship and to make citizenship depend on the actions of one\u2019s parents rather than \u2014 in all but the rarest of circumstances \u2014 the simple fact of being born in the United States,\u201d the court wrote.",
      "California Attorney General Rob Bonta, whose state was one of nearly 20 that were part of the lawsuit challenging the order, welcomed the ruling.",
      "\u201cThe First Circuit reaffirmed what we already knew to be true: The President\u2019s attack on birthright citizenship flagrantly defies the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and a nationwide injunction is the only reasonable way to protect against its catastrophic implications,\u201d Bonta said in a statement. \u201cWe are glad that the courts have continued to protect Americans\u2019 fundamental rights.\u201d",
      "A second appeals court ruling on Friday also found in favor of several organizations that challenged the birthright citizenship order. The plaintiffs, including New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support and League of United Latin American Citizens, were represented by the American Civil Liberties Union.",
      "\u201cThe federal appeals court today reinforced that this executive order is a flagrant violation of the U.S. Constitution \u2014 and we agree,\u201d said SangYeob Kim, senior staff attorney at the ACLU of New Hampshire. \u201cOur Constitution is clear: no politician can decide who among those born in this country is worthy of citizenship.\u201d",
      "In September, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to uphold its birthright citizenship order. The appeal sets in motion a process at the high court that could lead to a definitive ruling from the justices by early summer on whether the citizenship restrictions are constitutional.",
      "\u201cThe court is misinterpreting the 14th Amendment. We look forward to being vindicated by the Supreme Court,\u201d White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement.",
      "In July, U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin in Boston issued the third court ruling blocking the birthright order nationwide after a key Supreme Court decision in June. Less than two weeks later, a federal judge in Maryland also issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against the order. The issue is expected to move quickly back to the nation\u2019s highest court.",

      "A federal judge in New Hampshire later issued a ruling prohibiting Trump\u2019s executive order from taking effect nationwide in a new class-action suit, and a San Francisco-based appeals court affirmed a different lower court\u2019s nationwide injunction in a lawsuit that included state plaintiffs.",
      "At the heart of the lawsuits challenging the birthright order is the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which includes a citizenship clause that says all people born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to U.S. jurisdiction, are citizens.",
      "Plaintiffs in the Boston case \u2014 one of the cases the 1st Circuit considered \u2014 told Sorokin that the principle of birthright citizenship is \u201censhrined in the Constitution,\u201d and that Trump does not have the authority to issue the order, which they called a \u201cflagrantly unlawful attempt to strip hundreds of thousands of American-born children of their citizenship based on their parentage.\u201d",
      "Justice Department attorneys argued the phrase \u201csubject to United States jurisdiction\u201d in the amendment means that citizenship isn\u2019t automatically conferred to children based on their birth location alone.",

      "A judge has announced that the Georgia election interference case against Donald Trump and others will be dismissed in 14 days if a new prosecutor isn't appointed",
      "ATLANTA -- ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 The judge overseeing the Georgia election interference case against President Donald Trump and others says he will dismiss the case in 14 days if a new prosecutor hasn't been appointed to take it over.",
      "Fulton County Superior Judge Scott McAfee set the deadline in a one-paragraph order Friday afternoon. It is up to the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia to name a prosecutor for the case after Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis was disqualified from continuing the prosecution.",
      "\u201cShould an appointed prosecuting attorney or representative of PAC fail to file an entry of appearance or request a particularized extension within 14 days from the entry of this Notice, the Court will issue a dismissal without prejudice for want of prosecution,\u201d the judge wrote.",
      "\u201cWe have received the order and are reviewing it to provide a response to the court,\u201d Prosecuting Attorneys' Council spokesperson Tracy Walston said in an email.",
      "When Willis announced the indictment against Trump and 18 others in August 2023, the nearly 100-page indictment was the most sweeping of four criminal cases brought against the then-former president in a span of five months. She used the state\u2019s anti-racketeering law to allege a wide-ranging conspiracy to try to illegally overturn Trump\u2019s narrow loss to Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election in Georgia.",
      "Even if a new prosecutor is named within the two-week deadline it is unlikely that any prosecution against Trump could move forward while he is the sitting president. But there are 14 other people still facing charges in the case, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and former New York mayor and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani.",

      "GREENBELT, Md. -- GREENBELT, Md. (AP) \u2014 A California resident who attempted to assassinate U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh at his Maryland home was sentenced Friday to over eight years in prison by a federal judge, who imposed a punishment that is significantly more lenient than the Justice Department\u2019s recommendation.",
      "Sophie Roske, a transgender woman charged under her legal name, Nicholas Roske, had faced a maximum sentence of life in prison. U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman sentenced her to eight years and one month behind bars followed by a lifetime of court supervision. Prosecutors had asked for a prison sentence of no less than 30 years, which was the low end of the range recommended by sentencing guidelines.",
      "Roske, then 26, had a pistol, a knife, zip ties and burglary tools in her possession when a taxi dropped her off outside Kavanaugh\u2019s home in Chevy Chase, Maryland, just after 1 a.m. on June 8, 2022. Noticing two U.S. Marshals Service deputies guarding the residence, Roske kept walking down the street and took a phone call from her sister. Then she dialed 911, reported having suicidal and homicidal thoughts and said she needed psychiatric help.",
      "The judge said law enforcement didn't know anything about Roske's plot until she called 911 and reported her crime unprompted. Boardman described Roske's conduct as \u201creprehensible\u201d but credited her with abandoning the plot before police detected her presence in Kavanaugh's neighborhood.",
      "\u201cThis is an atypical defendant in an atypical case,\u201d she said.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said the Justice Department will appeal \"the woefully insufficient sentence ... which does not reflect the horrific facts of this case.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe attempted assassination of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was a disgusting attack against our entire judicial system by a profoundly disturbed individual,\u201d Bondi said in a statement.",
      "Roske apologized to Kavanaugh and the justice's family \u201cfor the considerable stress I put them through.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have been portrayed as a monster, and this tragic mistake that I made will follow me for the rest of my life,\u201d Roske said before learning her sentence.",

      "\u201cHe's a justice of the Supreme Court, but he's a human being,\u201d the judge said.",
      "After her arrest, Roske told investigators she was angry about a leaked draft opinion suggesting the Supreme Court intended to overrule Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion case, according to an FBI affidavit. Roske also was upset about the school massacre in Uvalde, Texas, and believed Kavanaugh would vote to loosen gun control laws, the affidavit said.",
      "Roske\u2019s case underscores the pervasive threat of political violence in a polarized nation: The number of threats and \u201cinappropriate communications\u201d directed at federal judges and other court employees more than quadrupled over a seven-year span, from 926 incidents in 2015 to 4,511 in 2021, according to the Marshals Service.",
      "Roske targeted three of the high court\u2019s justices, prosecutors said. Killing one judge could change the decisions of the nine-member court \u201cfor decades to come,\u201d Roske wrote over an encrypted messaging platform to another user in May 2022. Roske added, \u201cI am shooting for 3.\u201d",
      "Roske, 29, of Simi Valley, California, searched the internet for justices\u2019 home addresses and other information, including techniques for breaking into homes and quietly killing somebody. Roske also wrote about killing judges in encrypted messages.",

      "On Friday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the agency would send additional federal agents and the Justice Department was launching a civil rights investigation into the circumstances surrounding Sortor\u2019s arrest, and whether the Portland Police Bureau engages in viewpoint discrimination.",

      "The escalation of federal law enforcement in Portland, population 636,000 and Oregon's largest city, follows similar crackdowns to combat crime in other cities, including Chicago, Baltimore and Memphis.

The Multnomah County District Attorney's Office said it was reviewing the case and would make a decision on whether to proceed with charges before Sortor's arraignment Monday.",
      "What led to the arrests was not immediately clear. Portland police said they moved into the crowd to make arrests as fights broke out. They arrested Sorter and two others.",
      "All three were charged with second-degree disorderly conduct. Sorter was released Friday on his own recognizance, according to Multnomah County Sheriff\u2019s Office\u2019s online records. An email seeking comment from Sortor sent Friday went unanswered and no one answered phone numbers listed for him.",
      "In a post on X on Friday morning, Sortor said his arrest proved that Portland Police are corrupt and controlled by \u201cvioIent Antifa thugs who terrorize the streets.\u201d",

      "\"In terms of a business person, Taylor is at the top,\" said Kevin Evers, author of the new book \"There's Nothing Like This: The Strategic Genius of Taylor Swift,\" and a senior editor at the Harvard Business Review. \"She's always been extremely business savvy, and we can see this with this release, too.\"",

      "Four years ago, Goodall was asked by \"Sunday Morning\" why she persisted in such a grueling schedule. \"Because there's a message to get out, and I'm getting older, and there's less time left ahead of me, and the world's falling to pieces,\" she replied. \"Everybody can do something. I mean, when you go shopping you can ask yourself, 'Hmm, did this product harm the environment when it was made? Was it cruel to animals? Is it cheap?\u00a0Why\u00a0is it cheap? Is it cheap because of unfair wages? \u2026 If they care about the future, especially if they've got children, you don't have to do it all.

    "story": [
      "After eight seasons traveling the world for his Netflix series \"Somebody Feed Phil,\" Phil Rosenthal's next food adventure is keeping him much closer to home. The 65-year-old producer is opening a neighborhood spot in Los Angeles called Max and Helen's.",
      "\"This is a hundred-year-old neighborhood,\" Rosenthal said. \"I want it to look like we found a hundred-year-old diner and it's been here for a hundred years.\"",
      "The diner, set to open later this month in Larchmont, is named for Rosenthal's late parents, who were regulars on his travel show and inspired characters in \"Everybody Loves Raymond,\" the CBS sitcom he created nearly 30 years ago.",
      "The menu will lean on comfort food: Powdered donut holes, sourdough waffles with maple butter and fluffy scrambled eggs, a nod to his father's favorite dish.",
      "\"My dad loved fluffy eggs so much on his tombstone, it says, 'Are my eggs fluffy?'\" Rosenthal said. \"The lesson for me is, if you can find a simple joy in your life, maybe you'll be happy every day.\"",
      "Rosenthal grew reflective when speaking about his father's absence.",
      "\"I'm getting a little emotional that he can't be here for this perfect rendition of the thing he loved the most,\" he said.",
      "Building the world of \"Everybody Loves Raymond\"",
      "Simplicity, Rosenthal said, has always been key to his work. \"Everybody Loves Raymond\" ran for nine years by avoiding topical humor.",
      "\"You don't put in Bill Clinton jokes in the '90s,\" he said. \"You do the things that seem to be everlasting.\"",
      "After struggling to find a follow-up to the sitcom, Rosenthal pitched his Netflix show with one line: \"I'm exactly like Anthony Bourdain if he was afraid of everything.\" The food-and-travel series grew into a surprise hit, even drawing sold-out crowds when Rosenthal spoke about it on tour. \"Ray [Romano] came out on stage with me and couldn't believe the size of the crowd,\" he said.",
      "Rosenthal has enlisted acclaimed chef Nancy Silverton as executive chef, while his soon-to-be son-in-law Mason Royal will run the kitchen. Beyond the food, he hopes the diner will anchor his neighborhood.",
      "\"Diners are disappearing from America,\" he said. \"These become centers of communities\u2026. If the center of the community disappears, maybe you lose the sense of community and then maybe you lose the country. So I'm gonna fix everything with my diner.\"",
      "His production company is called Lucky Bastards, a label that still fits as he finds new joy in simple pleasures and fresh projects at 65.",
      "But Rosenthal brushed off any suggestion of retirement.",
      "\"I could. That's not fun,\" he said. \"If you think you've got something to say or a point to make, or feel like your work is impacting on one guy or one little kid even, who wants to stop?\"",

    "summary": "Dutch producer pitches her AI creation, Tilly Norwood, as the next Scarlett Johansson, and says several agents are vying to represent it.",
    "story": [
      "Like thousands of actors, Tilly Norwood is looking for a Hollywood agent. Her greatest role? Pretending to be human.",
      "That's because Tilly Norwood is a 100% AI-generated product, created by Dutch producer and comedian Eline Van der Velden, founder of a company named Xicoia, which bills itself as the world's first artificial intelligence talent studio. Velden pitches her AI creation as the next Scarlett Johansson, and says there are several agents vying to represent it, CBS News' Jo Ling Kent reported recently.",
      "Since Velden launched the digital character's prospective career, Tilly Norwood has been all the talk in Hollywood.",
      "But not in a good way. Guilds, actors and filmmakers have met the Xicoia product with an immediate wave of backlash, protesting that artificial intelligence should not have a starring role in the acting profession. In a statement Tuesday, the Screen Actors Guild said that \"creativity is, and should remain, human-centered.\"",
      "\"To be clear, 'Tilly Norwood' is not an actor, it's a character generated by a computer program that was trained on the work of countless professional performers \u2014 without permission or compensation,\" the guild said. \"It has no life experience to draw from, no emotion and, from what we've seen, audiences aren't interested in watching computer-generated content untethered from the human experience.\"",
      "Actor Sean Astin, who starred in \"Lord of the Rings\" and \"The Goonies,\" and was recently elected president of SAG-AFTRA, also emphasized how AI actors are artificial constructs trained off of work by real performers.",
      "\"You're made up of stuff that doesn't belong to you,\" he told CBS News. \"Let's just make sure that credit is given where credit is due.\"",
      "Van der Velden, who is also the founder of the AI production studio Particle6, promoted Tilly Norwood last month at the Zurich Summit, the industry sidebar of the Zurich Film Festival. It was there that she said talent agencies were circling Norwood and that she expected to soon announce a signing.",
      "Many in Hollywood hope that never happens.",
      "\"Any talent agency that engages in this should be boycotted by all guilds,\" wrote Natasha Lyonne on Instagram. The \"Russian Doll\" star is directing a feature titled \"Uncanny Valley\" that pledges to use \"ethical\" artificial intelligence in combination with traditional filmmaking techniques. \"Deeply misguided & totally disturbed,\" she added. \"Not the way. Not the vibe. Not the use.\"",
      "Artificial intelligence is often used as a tool in film production, though its implementation is hotly debated. It was a major bargaining point in the lengthy strike by SAG-AFTRA that concluded in late 2023 with some safeguards put in place to protect the use of actors' likenesses and performances by AI. A yearlong strike by video game actors hinged on AI protections. In July, video game actors approved a new contract that mandates employers obtain written permission to create a digital replica.",
      "But there have been numerous controversies over the use of AI in acting. The Oscar-winning 2024 film \"The Brutalist\" used artificial intelligence for Hungarian dialogue spoken by Adrien Brody and Felicity Jones' characters, the revelation of which prompted debate in the industry.",
      "Van der Velden responded to the stir around Tilly Norwood on Instagram.",
      "\"To those who have expressed anger over the creation of my AI character, Tilly Norwood, she is not a replacement for a human being, but a creative work \u2014 a piece of art,\" Van der Velden said on Sunday. \"Like many forms of art before her, she sparks conversation, and that in itself shows the power of creativity.\"",
      "Van der Velden didn't respond to interview requests Tuesday. In her post, she argued that AI characters should be judged as their own genre.",
      "\"Creating Tilly has been, for me, an act of imagination and craftsmanship, not unlike drawing a character, writing a role or shaping a performance,\" she added. \"It takes time, skill and iteration to bring such a character to life.\"",
      "That statement was also shared on Tilly Norwood's own Instagram account. Posts include photos of the creation drinking coffee, shopping for clothes and preparing for various projects. As of Tuesday, the account had more than 33,000 followers.",
      "A post shared by Tilly Norwood (@tillynorwood)",
      "\"Had such a blast filming some screen tests recently,\" one post reads. \"Every day feels like a step closer to the big screen.\"",
      "Asked what human actors bring to a performance that AI can't, Astin said \"authenticity,\" adding, \"You can fall in love. Your parents can die. You can you can be in some terrifying situation. The sum of all of our emotional experiences in our life, artificial intelligence can approximate it \u2014 it is not real.\"",

Fonda even spent the night of her 82nd birthday behind bars. The last time Fonda had spent the night in jail was in 1970, when she was 32, while on a speaking tour protesting the Vietnam War.",

    "summary": "With time running out to avert a government shutdown, millions of Americans who get health insurance under the Affordable Care Act could soon face sharply higher premiums.",
    "story": [
      "The dispute at the heart of the ongoing U.S. government shutdown\u00a0centers around a tax credit that helps 22 million Americans lower their health insurance costs when they buy policies through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces.",
      "Known as the enhanced premium tax credit, the subsidy has been used by millions of low- and middle-class households since it was authorized under the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021. Since then, spurred by the tax credit, the number of people who have enrolled in ACA marketplace health insurance plans has almost doubled, according to health care publication KFF.",
      "But it is set to expire at the end of 2025, and leading Democratic lawmakers are making a funding deal to keep the government open contingent on Republicans agreeing to extend the credit. A new Oct. 3 survey from health information group KFF found that three-quarters of those polled say they want Congress to extend the tax credits, with about 59% of Republicans saying they would like to see an extension.",
      "Even as the outcome of the funding negotiations in Washington, D.C., remains uncertain, expiration of the premium health care credits could inflict financial pain on millions of Americans, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"Insurers are already preparing to send notices to households that they will see increases starting in January 2026,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy at Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal economic advocacy group, and former a White House economic official under former President Joe Biden, on a conference call Friday to discuss the tax credit.",
      "He added, \"People are more and more concerned about the cost of living, and [this is] a hit to their pocketbooks that they will start seeing in weeks.\"",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the enhanced ACA premium tax credits set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "How much could ACA premiums increase?",
      "The cost of premiums for people who buy their insurance through the ACA marketplaces could more than double, rising from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to a Sept. 30 analysis by KFF. About 4 million people would likely drop their insurance coverage if the credit is allowed to expire because they would't be able to afford the costs, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The premium tax credit is aimed at people who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans, and who can't get affordable health care through an employer. The credit is available for those who earn between 100% to 400% of the poverty level, which means a family of four with annual income of up to $128,600 would qualify for the credit.",
      "With expiration of the ACA coverage credit only months away, some policy holders have already received noticed that their premiums \u2014 the monthly fee paid for insurance coverage \u2014 are poised to surge next year. Insurers have sent out notices in nearly every state, with some proposing premium increases of as much as 50%.",
      "Insurers are already planning on substantial premium hikes in 2026, according to a Peterson KFF Health System Tracker survey published last month. The poll found that 312 insurers participating in ACA marketplaces are proposing median increases of 18% next year, about 11 percentage points higher than in 2025.",
      "That increase would represent the largest rate hike since 2018, and is driven by higher costs for medical care as well as the expiration of the premium tax credits. Sharply higher ACA premiums would likely cause healthier people to drop coverage, making it more expensive to insure those who remain, the group said.",
      "The proposed hikes range from a high of 39.9%, from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma, to a low of 4.6% for Oscar Garden State Insurance Corporation, their survey found.",
      "In Iowa last month, the state's insurance commissioner weighed increases ranging from 3% to 37%, arousing public concerns. One woman who runs a garden center in Cedar Falls, Iowa, said she was considering dropping health insurance altogether.",
      "\"I am already living as frugally as I possibly can while working as hard as I possibly can, putting in as many hours as I am allowed to at my job, never missing a day of work,\" one woman, LuAnn, wrote in a comment published on the commissioner's website.",
      "Signs of financial fragility",
      "The potential hike in insurance costs comes as many Americans continue struggling with the cost of living, said Rohit Chopra, former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, on the conference call with Jacquez, organized by Groundwork, which supports extending the credits.",
      "\"Some people will need to drop their insurance all together, but households with someone with a chronic illness will have to pay those big, big increases,\" Chopra said. That would require some families to make tough financial choices, such as not paying other bills or accumulating debt to cover their expenses, he added.",
      "Although inflation around the U.S. has eased significantly since its post-pandemic peak in 2022, costs continue to inch higher. The Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target is slipping further from reach this year, with the Consumer Price Index climbing higher in recent months. Some consumers are showing signs of increasing financial stress, with credit card delinquencies on the rise and balances creeping higher.",
      "Meanwhile, many Americans aren't aware that the ACA enhanced premium tax credits will expire in a matter of months, KFF found in a survey.",
      "\"Consumers should not panic, but they do need to prepare,\" Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at insurance website Healthinsurance.org, said in an email.",
      "People should make sure to compare various plans available to them on the marketplaces and explore options such as Health Savings Plans, which allows people to set aside money to pay for medical expenses, she said.",

      "On Tuesday, the president announced that drug giant Pfizer had agreed to be part of a new direct-to-consumer government purchasing platform known as TrumpRx, that, according to Pfizer, will allow \"American patients to purchase medicines from Pfizer at a significant discount.\"",

      "Pfizer is the first of many drug makers the president claimed has agreed to offer steep drug discounts to all Americans through TrumpRx, in line with the lowest prices paid by Europeans.",
      "\"We've seen this disparity for a long time, and we know it has not been sustainable,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary told CBS News in an interview Thursday.",
      "The president also said that Pfizer had agreed to lower the cost of the prescription medications that it provides to Medicaid recipients.",
      "\"Pfizer is committing to offer all of their prescription medications to Medicaid, and it will be at the most-favored nations prices,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Makary argues the Trump administration's agreement with Pfizer will help in addressing health care costs across the board.",
      "\"By reigning in egregious drug prices, we're actually addressing the larger issue of healthcare costs in the United States, which is something no one has really be able to get a handle on until now,\" Makary said.",
      "According to Pfizer, TrumpRx will provide savings up to 85% for certain medications, such as Duavee, a drug that treats menopause symptoms.",
      "Duavee's sticker price is $203 per month, but according to Pfizer, on TrumpRx, it will cost $30 per month. Xeljanz, a Pfizer medication for arthritis, currently costs $6,000 out-of-pocket per month, but on TrumpRx, it will cost about $3,600.",
      "\"This is a major, major step, and we have to do it,\" Makary told CBS News when asked if, even with the discounts, the drugs will still be unaffordable for many Americans.",
      "The Trump administration said the TrumpRx website will launch next year, but Makarty did not have specific timing.",
      "Makary believes that patients with health insurance who are still unable to afford certain medications will still be helped by TrumpRx.",
      "\"I think it's going to help them significantly,\" Makary said. \"You're going to see a series of announcements by different pharmaceutical companies. This has been the No. 1 health priority in this administration.\"",
      "Sarah Wisniewski, a Maryland resident in her mid-40s, has been living with multiple sclerosis since 2018. Although she she says she has good insurance, it has repeatedly failed to cover the specialty medication her doctor prescribed to slow the progression of her disease. In 2024, when her physician recommended a treatment that could help, she says her insurance company denied coverage three times. She was only approved after the Maryland attorney general intervened.",
      "When CBS News asked Makarty about Wisniewski, he explained, \"I've seen that story throughout my career as a cancer surgeon, and it's tragic, and we've seen nothing on drug prices for the last 50 years.\"",
      "More than 90% of Americans have some form of health insurance, yet many still struggle to afford critical medications. Wisniewski told CBS News she is skeptical about the new TrumpRx program.",
      "\"If big pharma isn't required to put their drugs on this market, and if they're not forced to lower prices, then this feels like a toothless, symbolic statement, as opposed to having any real, long-term impact on the lives of the clinically ill,\" she said.",
      "She also questioned how the administration plans to pressure pharmaceutical companies to list the most urgently needed medications on the platform. Even at 50% to 80% cheaper, she said, some of these drugs remain unaffordable.",
      "Makary told CBS News that this is just the beginning of the solution:",
      "\"Each year, we throw good money after bad into a broken system where we pay more and more for drugs,\" Makary said. \"This is the first time we're seeing a major reset \u2014 cutting the price of some drugs, not all, but some, by 50% to 80%.\"",
      "Stacie Dusetzina, a prescription medication industry expert and a health policy professor at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, says the president's plan will not lower most Americans' out-of-pocket costs for medications.  \"The reality of who can actually benefit by paying cash for these drugs through this website, it's probably going to be a smaller number of people than what is being promoted,\" Dusetzina said.",
      "Sean Sullivan, a health economist at the University of Washington, also previously expressed doubts to CBS News about how much the program would help Americans save.",

      "But while many Planned Parenthood clinics provide abortion services, the clinics in Louisiana that closed had not offered abortion services at any time in their 40-year history, according to the New Orleans Health Department. Planned Parenthood has never had a license to perform abortions in Louisiana, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Last year, the clinic in New Orleans served about 16,000 patients for sexually transmitted infection care and testing, and almost 9,000 patients for family planning care, including birth control and pregnancy tests, according to Planned Parenthood data provided by the New Orleans Health Department.",
      "\"We know that Planned Parenthood New Orleans on Claiborne Avenue served tens of thousands of patients a year with sexual and reproductive health services, and that clinic was important, because it was open access for people who were uninsured or underinsured people who didn't feel comfortable going elsewhere,\" said Jeannie Donovan, deputy director of population health and disease prevention at the New Orleans Health Department. \"It served a real need in our community.\"",

      "A company with an incrementally funded government contract may find itself in a more precarious financial position. Under such contracts, the government pays a business for the work it does as a job progresses.",
      "\"During a shutdown, the funds might not be there for a contractor, and in such situations, those contractors are looking at whether they need to stop working or keep going, and try to get the government to pay them later,\" Beezley said.",
      "Even when contractors want to continue doing their jobs, they might be impeded by practical obstacles.",
      "\"Say a person who unlocks a government facility in the morning has been furloughed and a contractor shows up Monday morning and can't get into the facility \u2014 that impacts their performance,\" Beezley said.",
      "Federal agencies have the discretion to terminate such contracts, at which point a company can decide whether or not to continue paying workers, or assign them to another job.",
      "\"Most contracting companies out of goodness of heart don't keep paying janitors,\" Koh said. \"So in effect, most of them aren't getting paid.\"",
      "Attempts at legislation",
      "In 2023, Sen. Tina Smith, a Democratic Senator for Minnesota, introduced legislation to secure back pay for federal contract workers facing layoffs during a potential shutdown.",
      "\"Contractor employees perform jobs that are critical to the operation of our government, providing food service, security, and doing custodial work,\" Smith said in a statement at the time. \"These are often low-wage jobs that mean workers are living paycheck to paycheck. In the past, these workers haven't received back pay at the end of a government shutdown like the thousands of government employees. And it's time we right that wrong.\"",
      "The bill failed to advance.",
      "Small businesses",
      "As far as ripple effects go, businesses in places like Washington, D.C., Virginia and Maryland, that depend on government workers' patronage could start feeling a pinch if the shutdown drags on for more than a few weeks. Without cash in their pockets, such workers are expected to pull back on their discretionary spending, according to economists.",
      "\"If a shutdown is prolonged, there will be repercussions for businesses in certain areas with a large number of federal workers, if they aren't being paid,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics told CBS News. \"Areas that rely on the government workforce to spend at their business could be vulnerable.\"",

      "The app, which is free, relies on crowdsourcing to track ICE agents, with the company noting that it allows people to report sightings of ICE activities \"within a 5 mile radius of your current location.\" The app crossed 1 million downloads a month ago, the developer said. In its social media post, the ICEBlock developer blamed \"pressure from the Trump Admin.\" for the decision.",
      "\"We created the App Store to be a safe and trusted place to discover apps,\" Apple said in a statement. \"Based on information we've received from law enforcement about the safety risks associated with ICEBlock, we have removed it and similar apps from the App Store.\"",

      "\"We reached out to Apple today demanding they remove the ICEBlock app from their App Store \u2014 and Apple did so,\" Bondi said. \"ICEBlock is designed to put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs, and violence against law enforcement is an intolerable red line that cannot be crossed. This Department of Justice will continue making every effort to protect our brave federal law enforcement officers, who risk their lives every day to keep Americans safe.\"",
      "ICEBlock is one of a number of apps designed to let users track and anonymously report immigration agents.

    "summary": "The number of unemployed people looking for work more than six months has surged to its highest level since 2021.",
    "story": [
      "When Anna Whitlock was let go from her job in the technology industry in November of 2024, she wasn't worried about lining up a new position. The Washington state resident had 11 years of experience managing network infrastructure projects, a specialized role that involves equipping buildings with internet access, cameras and wifi security systems.",
      "\"The last time I had to job search, I found something pretty easily,\" she said.",
      "Almost a year later, the 37-year-old is still without a job. Whitlock said she has applied to hundreds of jobs \u2014 even for positions she's overqualified for \u2014 to no avail.",
      "\"The more I looked, the more I wasn't getting responses. If I did have an interview, I only made it the first one or two rounds,\" said Whitlock, who has a 16-year-old daughter. \"Things got really real when my unemployment ran out.\"",
      "Sidelined for months",
      "While the government's September jobs report\u00a0wasn't released on Friday\u00a0because of the government shutdown, other recent economic signals point to an increasingly challenging job market for people like Whitlock. Private employers\u00a0declined by 32,000 jobs\u00a0in September, according to payroll processing firm ADP. The number of job openings around the U.S. has also steadily dropped, economic data shows.",
      "And while the nation's unemployment rate remains historically low, at 4.3%, the share of Americans defined as long-term unemployed \u2014 or those unemployed for 27 weeks or longer \u2014 has risen to 26%, the highest in more than three years, labor data shows.",
      "As of August, the number of long-term unemployed people had risen to 1.9 million, according to government data \u2014 the highest level since 2021, when the nation was still reeling from the pandemic.",
      "With the job market faltering in recent months as employers put the brakes on hiring, more workers are being sidelined for months on end, economists told CBS News.",
      "\"We're continuing to see this low-hire, low-fire environment,\" said Laura Ullrich, Indeed's director of economic research for North America and a former official at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. \"There aren't really new jobs being opened up for people \u2014 there isn't room for new people to come in.\"",
      "A CBS News poll released Thursday captures the dimming view many Americans have of the labor market, with 33% of respondents describing it as \"good,\" down from 41% in April. What's more, 48% said they think there are fewer good jobs where they live compared to five years ago.",
      "1,000 job applications",
      "The rise in long-term unemployed Americans poses two risks, Ullrich said. Workers themselves can suffer financial setbacks as they burn through savings and take on debt to stay afloat. And the broader U.S. economy can suffer if people give up on looking for work after becoming discouraged at the prospects of finding a job.",
      "\"Folks who do go into this long-term unemployment category, it's harder for them to get back into the labor force,\" he said. \"The concern is that they become discouraged workers and they stop working, and then they fall out of the labor force entirely.\"",
      "People who have been hunting for a job for months say the process is both frustrating and demoralizing, especially after sending hundreds of applications that fail to get a response. James Strawn, 55, a software quality expert in Colorado who lost his job in July, said he's submitted 100 applications and only received one response.",
      "\"I've had people say, 'Those are rookie numbers, like that is nothing \u2014 I've submitted 1,000 applications',\" he told CBS News. \"Every morning when I get on LinkedIn \u2014 I'm on there all day now \u2014 I see another post that's like another horror story of looking for jobs.\"",
      "Strawn said he was rejected from a minimum wage job at a fitness center, and has taken on a seasonal job at UPS. But he's increasingly fearful that he may not find work in his technology field by year-end, when his severance pay runs out.",
      "Strawn also worries that ageism could be playing a role in his struggle to land a job in his field. \"It's going to take a small miracle to find something,\" he said. \"It's really tough \u2014 it's really a bad market.\"",
      "It's not only experienced workers who are struggling. Young workers and recent college graduates are also having a hard time breaking into the job market. Because there's a glut of workers looking for jobs, employers are requiring that applicants have more extensive \u00a0resumes, Ullrich told CBS News.",
      "\"They are asking for more years of experience, like nine-plus,\" she said. \"Most of it is because they can.\"",
      "The unemployment rate for 16-to-24-year-olds is \"slowly but steadily rising,\" said Elise Gould, an economist at the liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute.",
      "\"I was quickly humbled\"",
      "Matthew McMeans, who graduated from the University of Memphis last year, estimates he applied to roughly 500 jobs during an 18-month job search before landing a position as a full stack software engineer in early August. He described the job hunt as \"miserable\" and \"degrading\" given the difficulty in landing interviews.",
      "\"When I started my degree, the hopes were really high that you were going to get multiple offers when you graduated,\" the 23-year-old said. \"But as soon as I started really searching and applying, I was quickly humbled.\"",
      "The wobbly labor market has caught the attention of the Federal Reserve, which has a so-called dual mandate to keep both unemployment and inflation low. Last month, the central bank\u00a0cut interest rates for the first time since December 2024 in an effort to bolster the labor market.",
      "But even if the job market improves, for many the damage has already been done. Whitlock, the IT professional who has been unemployed for almost a year, said she's managed to get assistance through programs like SNAP, better known as food stamps, and to negotiate down her cell phone and car insurance bills.",
      "But she was also forced to liquidate her retirement fund and a small investment account to make sure she had enough to live on.",
      "Said Whitlock, \"I'm probably right now in a position where I've got maybe three months until I'm in a really bad spot.\"",

    "summary": "With time running out to avert a government shutdown, millions of Americans who get health insurance under the Affordable Care Act could soon face sharply higher premiums.",
    "story": [
      "The dispute at the heart of the ongoing U.S. government shutdown\u00a0centers around a tax credit that helps 22 million Americans lower their health insurance costs when they buy policies through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces.",
      "Known as the enhanced premium tax credit, the subsidy has been used by millions of low- and middle-class households since it was authorized under the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021. Since then, spurred by the tax credit, the number of people who have enrolled in ACA marketplace health insurance plans has almost doubled, according to health care publication KFF.",
      "But it is set to expire at the end of 2025, and leading Democratic lawmakers are making a funding deal to keep the government open contingent on Republicans agreeing to extend the credit. A new Oct. 3 survey from health information group KFF found that three-quarters of those polled say they want Congress to extend the tax credits, with about 59% of Republicans saying they would like to see an extension.",
      "Even as the outcome of the funding negotiations in Washington, D.C., remains uncertain, expiration of the premium health care credits could inflict financial pain on millions of Americans, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"Insurers are already preparing to send notices to households that they will see increases starting in January 2026,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy at Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal economic advocacy group, and former a White House economic official under former President Joe Biden, on a conference call Friday to discuss the tax credit.",
      "He added, \"People are more and more concerned about the cost of living, and [this is] a hit to their pocketbooks that they will start seeing in weeks.\"",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the enhanced ACA premium tax credits set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "How much could ACA premiums increase?",
      "The cost of premiums for people who buy their insurance through the ACA marketplaces could more than double, rising from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to a Sept. 30 analysis by KFF. About 4 million people would likely drop their insurance coverage if the credit is allowed to expire because they would't be able to afford the costs, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The premium tax credit is aimed at people who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans, and who can't get affordable health care through an employer. The credit is available for those who earn between 100% to 400% of the poverty level, which means a family of four with annual income of up to $128,600 would qualify for the credit.",
      "With expiration of the ACA coverage credit only months away, some policy holders have already received noticed that their premiums \u2014 the monthly fee paid for insurance coverage \u2014 are poised to surge next year. Insurers have sent out notices in nearly every state, with some proposing premium increases of as much as 50%.",
      "Insurers are already planning on substantial premium hikes in 2026, according to a Peterson KFF Health System Tracker survey published last month. The poll found that 312 insurers participating in ACA marketplaces are proposing median increases of 18% next year, about 11 percentage points higher than in 2025.",
      "That increase would represent the largest rate hike since 2018, and is driven by higher costs for medical care as well as the expiration of the premium tax credits. Sharply higher ACA premiums would likely cause healthier people to drop coverage, making it more expensive to insure those who remain, the group said.",
      "The proposed hikes range from a high of 39.9%, from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma, to a low of 4.6% for Oscar Garden State Insurance Corporation, their survey found.",
      "In Iowa last month, the state's insurance commissioner weighed increases ranging from 3% to 37%, arousing public concerns. One woman who runs a garden center in Cedar Falls, Iowa, said she was considering dropping health insurance altogether.",
      "\"I am already living as frugally as I possibly can while working as hard as I possibly can, putting in as many hours as I am allowed to at my job, never missing a day of work,\" one woman, LuAnn, wrote in a comment published on the commissioner's website.",
      "Signs of financial fragility",
      "The potential hike in insurance costs comes as many Americans continue struggling with the cost of living, said Rohit Chopra, former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, on the conference call with Jacquez, organized by Groundwork, which supports extending the credits.",
      "\"Some people will need to drop their insurance all together, but households with someone with a chronic illness will have to pay those big, big increases,\" Chopra said. That would require some families to make tough financial choices, such as not paying other bills or accumulating debt to cover their expenses, he added.",
      "Although inflation around the U.S. has eased significantly since its post-pandemic peak in 2022, costs continue to inch higher. The Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target is slipping further from reach this year, with the Consumer Price Index climbing higher in recent months. Some consumers are showing signs of increasing financial stress, with credit card delinquencies on the rise and balances creeping higher.",
      "Meanwhile, many Americans aren't aware that the ACA enhanced premium tax credits will expire in a matter of months, KFF found in a survey.",
      "\"Consumers should not panic, but they do need to prepare,\" Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at insurance website Healthinsurance.org, said in an email.",
      "People should make sure to compare various plans available to them on the marketplaces and explore options such as Health Savings Plans, which allows people to set aside money to pay for medical expenses, she said.",
      "\"Being proactive will help minimize financial surprises,\" Norris said.",

      "Many Americans are eager to put money away for retirement, but that goal is increasingly out of reach because more workers are living paycheck to paycheck, a new Goldman Sachs study finds.",
      "Roughly 42% of younger working Americans \u2014 spanning Gen Z, millennials and Gen X \u2014 report having no spare savings after covering their basic living expenses, according to the analysis, which surveyed about 3,600 workers and 1,500 retirees. Among those just getting by, about three-quarters said they are struggling to save for retirement, the survey found.",
      "The share of U.S. workers in this precarious financial position has grown significantly since 1997, when 31% lived paycheck to paycheck, according to Goldman. The investment bank projects that figure could climb to well over half of Americans by 2033 as essentials like housing and health care continue to rise in cost.",
      "\"Save more\" ignores reality",
      "The findings underscore the challenges millions of Americans now face just making ends meets while also managing to set aside money for retirement, a financial pinch that Goldman Sachs calls a \"financial vortex.\" That money crunch helps explains why more than a quarter of older Americans are nearing retirement without anything saved \u2014 a gap that could widen given the financial pressures facing younger workers.",
      "\"These findings force us to ask a very critical question: Does the retirement math still work? The answer is no,\" said Greg Wilson, head of retirement at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, in a conference call to discuss the report. \"Telling workers just to 'save more' ignores the realities they face.\"",
      "Skipping a latte or avocado toast isn't likely to make much of a dent in the financial dynamics facing workers today, with Goldman finding that basic expenses are consuming an ever growing share of people's after-tax income.",
      "For instance, homeownership now eats up 51% of income, up from 33% in 2000, while health care costs account for 16% of after-tax earnings, up from 10% a quarter century ago, the analysis found.",
      "\"The mounting challenges American workers face ... make it harder than ever to save for retirement,\" Wilson said.",
      "Such financial pressures come as many Americans are on their own to plan, and save for, their retirement, largely because of the shift in the 1980s from company-sponsored pensions to 401(k) plans.",
      "As a savings vehicle, 401(k) shifts the burden onto workers, who must decide how much to save, how to invest and how to draw down their money in retirement \u2014 a do-it-yourself approach that retirement experts such as Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist at The New School for Social Research in New York,\u00a0describe as inadequate.",
      "Hoping for a miracle",
      "Financial professionals say it's no coincidence that members of Generation X, which entered the workforce just as the shift to 401(k)s became mainstream, is feeling unprepared as they get closer to retirement. Now 45 to 60 years old, almost half said they believed it would take a \"miracle\" for them to be able to retire, a Natixis study found last year.",
      "Goldman acknowledged that it can be difficult to close a retirement funding gap with savings alone, but noted that some strategies could help. Some approaches may be out of reach for older workers, like Gen X and millennials, but could be of use for their children \u2014 for instance, setting aside $500 a year from ages 1 to 20, a move Goldman found could increase retirement savings by 14%.",
      "Adding private market investments to a portfolio could also help boost retirement savings by 14% through higher returns, according to Goldman. Those strategies might become more accessible for workers under a Trump administration plan to open up 401(k)\u00a0plans to private equity, cryptocurrencies and other alternative investments.",
      "Lastly, if possible, workers should take advantage of benefits from their employers such as funding an emergency savings account, which can help them avoid raiding their 401(k) in case of an unexpected expense, such as medical bills, the bank notes.",
      "Even so, while those approaches might work for workers with access to employer-sponsored retirement plans, about half of all U.S. private-sector workers\u00a0lack access to such programs, an analysis from the Pew Charitable Trusts found earlier this year. Although it's possible to save for retirement without a 401(k), many workers without access to an employer retirement plan said they struggled to build wealth, the Pew survey found.",

      "Today, the number saying the economy is getting worse has ticked up again, as prices continue to weigh on perceptions.",
      "Prices continue to be the main metric people use to evaluate the wider economy. And most say in the last few weeks, prices of the goods and services they buy have still been going up.

      "Some of that may be driven by prospective outlook. Most who are currently employed do feel at least somewhat, if not very, secure in their jobs right now. Yet most Americans think if they were looking for a job, it would be difficult to find the kind of job they want.",

By 4 to 1, Americans think there are fewer \u2014 not more \u2014 good jobs where they live than there were five years ago, and the rest see it holding steady. Even workers who feel they have some job security tend to think there are fewer, not more, good jobs out there.",

    "published": "Thu, 02 Oct 2025 11:05:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A shutdown could cost the economy $7 billion each week, according to one analysis.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The fight over funding the government is likely to be a costly one.",
      "Each week of the ongoing government shutdown could cost the economy $7 billion and reduce GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points, according to an estimate published by EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco. That cost is a function of reduced pay for federal employees, delayed government procurement of goods and a decline in demand.",
      "To some extent, a portion of that economic cost would be reversed when the government reopens, as furloughed employees receive back pay and economic activity increases, the analysis said.",
      "It's likely that not everything would be reversible, though. The last shutdown \u2014 which was during President Trump's first term and lasted 34 days, beginning in December 2018 and ending in January 2019 \u2014 cost the U.S. economy about $11 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "During that shutdown, the longest on record, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that real gross domestic product in the fourth quarter of 2018 took a $3 billion hit (in 2019 dollars). And it estimated that in the first quarter of 2019, real GDP was \"$8 billion lower than it would have been \u2014 an effect reflecting both the five-week partial shutdown and the resumption in economic activity once funding resumed.\"",
      "The shutdown could shake Americans' faith in the economy, too. EY-Parthenon notes that at the time, the 2019 shutdown led to the sharpest monthly drop in the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index up since 2012.",
      "Some of the shutdown costs also stem from the administrative effort necessary to create contingency plans when the government is shut down and reopened. Agencies lose user fees collected from visitors to the national parks or from people seeking certain federal permits or visas. And there are higher premiums in federal contracting during a shutdown and the back pay federal employees eventually receive when the government reopens.",
      "Current federal law requires that federal workers be paid at their regular rate, whether they're furloughed or not, once the government is operating again. In a new analysis cited by the White House, the Congressional Budget Office estimates the federal government will pay $400 million a day for furloughed employees, who will not be working during the shutdown.",
      "A September 2019 report from a Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs subcommittee estimated the last three government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 \"cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion \u2014 at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed federal workers, and at least $338 million in other costs associated with the shutdowns, including extra administrative work, lost revenue, and late fees on interest payments.\"",
      "The White House Office of Management and Budget estimated that during the 16-day shutdown of 2013, federal employees received $2.5 billion in pay and benefits for hours they did not work, plus $10 million in penalty interest payments and lost fees.",
      "2025 shutdown",
      "But this time may be different. President Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Russell Vought, the OMB director, say layoffs will happen soon if the shutdown continues, so the net fiscal impact of a shutdown to the federal government is a little harder to predict right now. Vought immediately began freezing or slashing federal funding for projects, largely in blue states, during the shutdown. The Trump administration is withholding $18 billion in infrastructure projects in New York City, and cutting funding for climate-related projects in many states that Kamala Harris won.",
      "Vought also told Republican lawmakers Wednesday that Reduction in Force \u2014 or RIF \u2014 cuts would begin in two days.",
      "The president said Tuesday \"a lot of good can come down from shutdowns,\" and suggested Vought could use the shutdown to permanently cut federal workers and programs the administration doesn't want but that have the backing of Democrats.",
      "\"We can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible for them, that are bad for them and irreversible by them,\" Mr. Trump said of Democrats. \"Like cutting vast numbers of people out, cutting things that they like, cutting programs that they like.\"",

      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",

      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",

      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",

      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers.

    "summary": "The U.S. government shut down on Wednesday after Congress failed to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",

      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date.

The layoffs this year, although elevated, remain well below the massive workforce reductions in 2020, when the pandemic shuttered businesses across the nation, leading to 2 million layoffs through September of that year, Challenger noted.",
      "The rise in layoffs comes as the labor market has stalled in recent months, with employers also sharply scaling back their hiring plans, according to labor data. Companies now expect to bring on 58% fewer workers for the rest of the year compared with their projections a year ago, the firm found.",
      "\"Previous periods with this many job cuts occurred either during recessions or, as was the case in 2005 and 2006, during the first wave of automations that cost jobs in manufacturing and technology,\" said Andy Challenger, senior vice president and labor expert for Challenger, Gray & Christmas, in a statement.",
      "The government shutdown could lead to more job cuts, with the White House Office of Management and Budget last week\u00a0telling federal agencies\u00a0to consider layoffs during a closure.",

      "In the absence of the government's monthly jobs report, other measures of the labor market's health are drawing more attention from economists. On Wednesday, ADP said that payrolls at private employers declined by 32,000 jobs in September.",
      "However, some signs suggest that the pace of layoffs is easing, with Challenger's data showing that businesses announced roughly 54,000 job cuts in September, a 37% drop from the nearly 86,000 cuts announced in August.",

The Fed is penciling in two additional rate cuts for the remainder of 2025.",
      "A decline in borrowing costs for businesses and consumers could help bolster the job market, Challenger said. As interest rates fall, businesses have more flexibility to expand and hire more workers.",

    "story": [
      "Stocks closed at record highs Wednesday despite a U.S. government shutdown\u00a0expected to idle hundreds of thousands of workers and hobble federal agencies charged with dispensing a range of critical services. So why do investors seem unfazed?",
      "Although shutdowns have serious, real-world consequences for millions of Americans, data shows they tend to have a modest impact on financial markets and the broader economy, especially if the closure is brief.",
      "\"Most of the economic activity is delayed and usually gets made up shortly after a shutdown ends,\" Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, told CBS News. \"So I can't imagine this will be anything terribly disruptive for the equity markets.\"",
      "Over the previous 22 shutdowns the U.S. has seen since 1976, the S&P 500 rose during some of the closures while falling at other times. Overall, the stock index gained an average of 0.3% during the episodes, according to an analysis from Carson Group (see chart).",
      "What's more, the stock index jumped 13% on average in the 12 months following the shutdowns, the asset management firm found.",
      "\"Government shutdowns are inconvenient and messy, but there is little evidence that they have a significant impact on the economy,\" said Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at investment firm Global X, in a report.",
      "During the longest shutdown in U.S. history, which started in December 2018 and extended into January of the following year, some 800,000 federal workers were furloughed or worked without pay. That put many employees under severe financial pressure, driving some to food banks and others to launch online fundraising campaigns.",
      "Yet for the $30 trillion U.S. economy as a whole, that lost income amounted to a drop in the bucket, noted Thomas Ryan, North America economist at investment advisory firm Capital Economics. Consumption across the U.S. dipped for the two months the government remained partially shuttered, but quickly recovered.",
      "With Wall Street shrugging off the headlines on Wednesday, the S&P 500 closed up 0.3%, topping the all-time high it set last week. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average also finished in record territory.",
      "Why this time could be different",
      "The caveat? History is a guide \u2014 not a guarantee that events will follow the same script. The political dynamics driving the latest meltdown in Congress obviously differ from those that shaped previous eras, making it hard to predict how long the latest shutdown will last. An impasse lasting a month or more would fuel market uncertainty and could shake investor confidence, according to Wall Street analysts.",
      "\"Right now uncertainty is picking up again with new tariffs announced last week, and this just adds to it, which can paralyze growth for the foreseeable future,\" economist Daniel Altman and author of newsletter High Yield Economics, told CBS News. \"It makes it harder for stocks to continue rising if nobody knows what the fiscal picture is going to be like for the next year.\"",
      "If the shutdown drags on, companies could also press pause on making investment and hiring decisions, which would weigh on stock prices, Altman said.",
      "The latest closure will have another immediate impact that could fray investor nerves \u2014 halting the flow of economic reports that experts use to assess everything from the rate of inflation to the pace of job growth.

      "\"To be clear, 'Tilly Norwood' is not an actor, it's a character generated by a computer program that was trained on the work of countless professional performers \u2014 without permission or compensation,\" the guild said. \"It has no life experience to draw from, no emotion and, from what we've seen, audiences aren't interested in watching computer-generated content untethered from the human experience.\"",
      "Actor Sean Astin, who starred in \"Lord of the Rings\" and \"The Goonies,\" and was recently elected president of SAG-AFTRA, also emphasized how AI actors are artificial constructs trained off of work by real performers.",
      "\"You're made up of stuff that doesn't belong to you,\" he told CBS News. \"Let's just make sure that credit is given where credit is due.\"",
      "Van der Velden, who is also the founder of the AI production studio Particle6, promoted Tilly Norwood last month at the Zurich Summit, the industry sidebar of the Zurich Film Festival. It was there that she said talent agencies were circling Norwood and that she expected to soon announce a signing.",
      "Many in Hollywood hope that never happens.",
      "\"Any talent agency that engages in this should be boycotted by all guilds,\" wrote Natasha Lyonne on Instagram. The \"Russian Doll\" star is directing a feature titled \"Uncanny Valley\" that pledges to use \"ethical\" artificial intelligence in combination with traditional filmmaking techniques. \"Deeply misguided & totally disturbed,\" she added. \"Not the way. Not the vibe. Not the use.\"",
      "Artificial intelligence is often used as a tool in film production, though its implementation is hotly debated. It was a major bargaining point in the lengthy strike by SAG-AFTRA that concluded in late 2023 with some safeguards put in place to protect the use of actors' likenesses and performances by AI. A yearlong strike by video game actors hinged on AI protections. In July, video game actors approved a new contract that mandates employers obtain written permission to create a digital replica.",
      "But there have been numerous controversies over the use of AI in acting. The Oscar-winning 2024 film \"The Brutalist\" used artificial intelligence for Hungarian dialogue spoken by Adrien Brody and Felicity Jones' characters, the revelation of which prompted debate in the industry.",
      "Van der Velden responded to the stir around Tilly Norwood on Instagram.",
      "\"To those who have expressed anger over the creation of my AI character, Tilly Norwood, she is not a replacement for a human being, but a creative work \u2014 a piece of art,\" Van der Velden said on Sunday. \"Like many forms of art before her, she sparks conversation, and that in itself shows the power of creativity.\"",
      "Van der Velden didn't respond to interview requests Tuesday. In her post, she argued that AI characters should be judged as their own genre.",
      "\"Creating Tilly has been, for me, an act of imagination and craftsmanship, not unlike drawing a character, writing a role or shaping a performance,\" she added. \"It takes time, skill and iteration to bring such a character to life.\"",
      "That statement was also shared on Tilly Norwood's own Instagram account. Posts include photos of the creation drinking coffee, shopping for clothes and preparing for various projects. As of Tuesday, the account had more than 33,000 followers.",
      "A post shared by Tilly Norwood (@tillynorwood)",
      "\"Had such a blast filming some screen tests recently,\" one post reads. \"Every day feels like a step closer to the big screen.\"",
      "Asked what human actors bring to a performance that AI can't, Astin said \"authenticity,\" adding, \"You can fall in love. Your parents can die. You can you can be in some terrifying situation. The sum of all of our emotional experiences in our life, artificial intelligence can approximate it \u2014 it is not real.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jobs-manufacturing-trump-tariffs-economy/",
    "published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 15:09:13 -0400",
    "summary": "Uncertainty over U.S. tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies are deterring manufacturers from hiring, according to the Center for American Progress.",
    "story": [
      "Manufacturers in the U.S. are cutting thousands of jobs even as President Trump pushes economic policies that he says will revitalize the industry.",
      "Employers shed 12,000 manufacturing jobs\u00a0in August, while payrolls in the sector have shrunk by 42,000 since April, according to a new\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the Center for American Progress (CAP) that draws on government labor data.",
      "The nonpartisan policy institute attributes that decline to the Trump administration's steep new tariffs; hardline stance on immigration; and the Republican-backed \"big, beautiful bill,\" a tax and spending package enacted by Mr. Trump in July that CAP says hurts renewable energy companies by phasing out certain tax credits.",
      "For all of 2025, manufacturing employment in the U.S. has sunk by a total of 33,000 jobs, according to Labor Department\u00a0figures. Most of those job losses have been among companies that make durable goods, such as cars, household appliances and electronics. The drop comes as hiring overall has slowed sharply in recent months, with employers adding only 22,000 jobs in August, well below forecasts.",
      "The number of manufacturing jobs in the U.S. has declined for the past six decades, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. In 1960, manufacturing represented about 34% of total employment, while the number of jobs in the sector peaked in 1970 at 19.5 million. As of August this year, 12.7 million Americans were employed in manufacturing, while the industry lost 87,000 jobs in 2024,\u00a0data shows.",
      "Uncertainty hurting businesses",
      "When Mr. Trump in April announced a range of levies on dozens of other countries, the White House said tariffs would protect American workers by reducing the U.S. trade deficit with its economic partners and spurring employers to move manufacturing jobs to the U.S.",
      "For now, however, confusion over the scale and scope of U.S. tariffs has put manufacturers on the defensive, increasing their costs and discouraging them from hiring, economist Sara Estep, one of the authors of the CAP report, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Companies are uncertain about what's happening,\" she said. \"Everything has been changing on a day-to-day basis, so it's not clear what production should look like. That's why they aren't hiring.\"",
      "In August, for example, farm equipment giant John Deere cited tariffs in announcing that its sales and operating profits had dipped from a year ago. In an earnings call, an executive with the company noted that it had racked up roughly $300 million in tariff-related costs, including on steel and aluminum imports. John Deere also announced it was laying off more than 200 workers at plants in Illinois and Iowa, according to AgWeb, a trade publication.",
      "Automakers pointed partly to tariffs in announcing nearly 5,000 job cuts in July, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, while it noted that the retail sector has also stepped up layoffs and store closures because of economic uncertainty.",
      "Another factor fueling uncertainty for manufacturers are the ongoing legal challenges to the Trump tariffs, making it hard to plan and invest for the future, according to experts.",
      "A federal appeals court in August ruled that Mr. Trump unlawfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose sweeping tariffs on U.S. trade partners. Mr. Trump on September 3\u00a0asked the Supreme Court\u00a0to review the lower court's decision before it takes effect in October.",
      "The outcome of the case leaves many manufacturers in doubt about how to proceed, making them reluctant to expand their workforce as they seek to control costs, Daco told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The slowdown is symptomatic of an environment where purchasing managers are all under stress, and they are being squeezed by higher costs of goods and reduced demand,\" said EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco. \"And so in that squeeze, they are having to find ways to offset the higher costs, and one of the avenues to do that is to streamline their operations and make sure that they only have the essential talent on hand.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to several requests for comment on CAP's findings. The Office of the United States Trade Representative and National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Immigration effect",
      "The Trump administration's crackdown on U.S. immigrants is also weighing on hiring in manufacturing, said Daniel Altman, an economist and author of the High Yield Economics newsletter.",
      "\"Immigration has been an important source of employment in manufacturing for some industries, and if you take away some of their labor supply, that's just gives them more incentive to pursue automation and other forms of capital intensive manufacturing,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The government stepped up its campaign last week when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents\u00a0detained 475 immigrants, most of them Korean, at a Hyundai plant in Georgia because they were suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally.",
      "Border patrol agents have also\u00a0conducted raids targeting immigrants working in retail, according to CBS News. In sectors like farming, food processing and construction, undocumented immigrants make up to 20% of the workforce, according to\u00a0Goldman Sachs.",
      "White House \"border czar\" Tom Homan on Sunday said the White House will expand such efforts.",
      "\"We're going to do more worksite enforcement operations,\" Homan told CNN. \"No one hires an illegal alien out of the goodness of their heart. They hire them because they can work them harder, pay them less, undercut the competition that hires U.S. citizen employees.\"",
      "Other long-term factors that go beyond the Trump administration's policies are also contributing to the ongoing contraction in manufacturing jobs. During the pandemic, manufacturers invested heavily in technologies to automate their operations, Altman noted.",
      "\"We've seen a lot of automation, which means companies do not need as many workers to provide the same output,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Output per worker has been increasing, and when we see that kind of increase in labor productivity, it usually means workers have access to more capital, or better technology or both, and that's what you'd expect with automation.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-trump-fire-lisa-cook/",
    "published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 15:08:46 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal district ruled in September that President Trump's attempt to fire Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors was likely illegal.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday said it will hear arguments in January on whether President Trump can fire Lisa Cook from her position on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.",
      "The high court said in a brief unsigned order that it is not yet acting on Mr. Trump's request for emergency relief. The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court last month to freeze a lower court order that found Cook's purported removal was likely illegal and allowed her to remain a Fed governor.",
      "By deferring a decision on the president's bid for emergency relief, Cook can remain in her position on the Fed's Board of Governors for now.",
      "Cook participated in a two-day meeting of the Fed's interest-rate-setting committee last month, which culminated with the central bank announcing its first cut to its benchmark interest rate in nine months. The panel will meet next in October and December.",
      "Her lawyers warned the Supreme Court that allowing Mr. Trump to remove Cook from the board of governors even for a brief period would have severe consequences, risking chaos and disruption of financial markets.",
      "Accepting the president's argument, Cook's lawyers said, \"would eviscerate the Federal Reserve's longstanding independence, upend financial markets, and create a blueprint for future presidents to direct monetary policy based on their political agendas and election calendars.\"",
      "But they warned it would also open the Fed up to political influence. Granting Mr. Trump the emergency relief he sought would \"sound the death knell\" for the Fed's independence\" and transform it into a body that is \"subservient to the President's will,\" Cook's lawyers wrote.",
      "Cook's attorneys, Abbe Lowell and Norm Eisen, said in a statement that the order \"rightly allows Governor Cook to continue in her role on the Federal Reserve Board, and we look forward to further proceedings consistent with the Court's order.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in response to the Supreme Court's move that \"President Trump lawfully removed Lisa Cook for cause from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. We look forward to ultimate victory after presenting our oral arguments before the Supreme Court in January.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Cook from the Fed board in August and her subsequent lawsuit arguing the removal broke the law set up a major test of his authority to oust key officials at the central bank. The president has criticized the Fed for not lowering interest rates sooner and is seeking to put his stamp on the seven-member board.",
      "The Senate confirmed Stephen Miran, an adviser to Mr. Trump, to the board of governors last month. Miran chaired the White House's Council of Economic Advisers and is taking an unpaid leave of absence from that job while serving on the Fed board, an unusual move.",
      "Mr. Trump's efforts to oust Cook are unprecedented, as no president has attempted to remove a sitting Fed governor in the central bank's 112-year-history. Critics of the move have warned that the effort harms the Fed's independence and could destabilize markets.",
      "In announcing his decision to fire her, the president claimed Cook made misrepresentations on mortgage documents in 2021, before she was appointed to the board of governors, by claiming two different properties in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Atlanta as her principal residence in order to gain more favorable lending terms.",
      "Cook's lawyers have said she \"did not ever commit mortgage fraud,\" and she has not been charged with any wrongdoing. They called the allegations \"flimsy\" and \"unproven.\" Reuters reported\u00a0that a loan estimate for the property in Atlanta, dated May 28, 2021, showed that Cook declared that residence as a \"vacation home.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump said the alleged misstatements gave him \"sufficient cause\" to remove Cook from the Fed board.",
      "\"That the Federal Reserve Board plays a uniquely important role in the American economy only heightens the government's and the public's interest in ensuring that an ethically compromised member does not continue wielding its vast powers,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a request for emergency relief to the Supreme Court.",
      "He continued: \"Put simply, the President may reasonably determine that interest rates paid by the American people should not be set by a Governor who appears to have lied about facts material to the interest rates she secured for herself \u2014 and refuses to explain the apparent misrepresentations.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled last month that Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Cook likely violated federal law because he did not state a legally permissible cause for her removal. The judge said the president's reason for ousting Cook rests on alleged actions before she joined the Fed board, and found the requirement that Fed governors can only be removed \"for cause\" covers only conduct while in-office.",
      "Cook joined the Fed board in 2022 and was reappointed by President Biden to a 14-year-term that is set to end in 2038.",
      "Cobb also ruled that Cook's due process rights were likely violated because she did not receive notice and an opportunity to be heard before her removal.",
      "The Trump administration appealed the district judge's decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which voted 2-1 to decline its request to let Mr. Trump fire Cook.",
      "The two-judge majority agreed that Cook did not receive adequate process before her removal. It did not address whether Mr. Trump satisfied the \"for cause\" removal requirement.",
      "In its emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, the Trump administration said it is not challenging the constitutionality of the for-cause removal restriction for Fed governors enacted by Congress.",
      "But Cook's lawyers said there must be \"some meaningful check\" on the president's ability to remove her.",
      "\"Otherwise, any president could remove any governor based on any charge of wrongdoing, however flawed,\" they wrote in a Supreme Court filing. \"That regime is not what Congress envisioned when it protected the Federal Reserve Board from presidential control. That regime is not what this Court envisioned when it went out of its way to single out the Board as a unique institution with a unique history of independence.\"",
      "Cook is one of several Democratic-appointed officials at independent agencies that Mr. Trump has moved to fire since returning to the White House. The Supreme Court has so far allowed the president to oust members of the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board, Consumer Product Safety Commission and Federal Trade Commission without cause.",
      "It will hear arguments in December on the constitutionality of removal protections for FTC commissioners and whether to overturn a key 1935 decision that allowed Congress to insulate certain independent agencies from political pressure. The case tests the scope of the president's removal authority.",
      "But the high court in May suggested the Fed is different from those agencies because it is a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",

    "summary": "Monthly report shows private employers shed 32,000 jobs last month, another sign the labor market is facing new challenges.",
    "story": [
      "The ADP National Employment Report, a measure of private employment in the U.S., said on Wednesday that payrolls at private employers declined by 32,000 jobs last month, signaling the labor market continued to face headwinds in September.",
      "More attention may be given to the ADP data this week because the government's monthly jobs report, scheduled for release on Friday, Oct. 3, could be delayed due to the government shutdown that began today, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which issues the federal monthly jobs report, noted in a statement that it has halted data releases \"due to the suspension of Federal government services.\" It added, \"The last update to the site was Wednesday, Oct. 1, 2025. Updates to the site will start again when the Federal government resumes operations.\"",
      "The ADP report, which is based on payroll data from more than 26 million U.S. employees, comes as the U.S. economy expanded at a stronger-than-expected rate in the second quarter. At the same time, the government's monthly jobs reports this summer have shown disappointing job growth as some businesses are holding off on hiring amid economic challenges such as tariffs and artificial intelligence.",
      "\"This is the latest data point signaling a fairly dramatic softening in labor momentum as companies aggressively dial back on hiring,\" Adam Crisafulli, head of investment advisory firm Vital Knowledge, said in a report.",
      "September's ADP decline represents the largest since March 2023, according to Capital Economics.",
      "The government jobs report, issued by the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, is expected to show that employers hired 50,000 people last month, according to economists polled by financial data company FactSet. Given the government shutdown, it's unclear whether the report will be issued Friday, or, if not, how long it might be delayed.",
      "The ADP report differs from the BLS monthly jobs report in that it only tracks employment at private businesses, while the government data covers both private employers and public sector hiring at local, state and federal levels. As a result, the two reports can differ significantly, and the ADP report doesn't always foreshadow the BLS' monthly data.",
      "\"Although there is only a passing correlation between monthly changes in the ADP measure of private payrolls and the official non-farm payrolls estimates, the plunge in the former in September is a concern, particularly since the government shutdown could delay the release of the official employment data,\" Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist with Capital Economics, sad in a report Wednesday.",
      "The Federal Reserve is scheduled to make its next interest-rate decision on Oct. 29, with most economists forecasting a cut of 0.25 percentage points, according to CME FedWatch. The Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark rate by that amount at its meeting last month, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell citing weaker labor market conditions as a reason for the move to ease borrowing costs.",
      "\"If the shutdown drags on, the weakness in the ADP will be all the Fed has to go on as it considers another rate cut at the FOMC meeting late this month,\" Brown said.",
      "Most of the weakness last month was due to small and midsize businesses shedding jobs, while large employers \u2014 those with more than 500 workers \u2014 added 33,000 employees in September, ADP said.",
      "ADP also revised its August numbers downward to show that private businesses shed 3,000 jobs, versus its earlier estimate that companies had hired 54,000 employees that month.",

    "published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 11:17:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Pfizer's CEO said President Trump's threat of tariffs motivated his company to take swift action.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Pfizer has agreed to offer significantly discounted prices for some prescription drugs for all American consumers and has committed to offer prescription medications to Medicaid at lower prices, President Trump announced Tuesday. The president said the drugs will be available for purchase online on a website operated by the federal government, which the White House has said will be called \"TrumpRx.\"",
      "\"Today, I'm thrilled to announce that one of the world's largest pharmaceutical manufacturers and one of the best anywhere in the world, Pfizer, has agreed to offer countless prescription medications at major discounts in the United States, a result of the 'most favored nation' drug pricing order that we established earlier this year,\" Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office.",
      "Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, who was in the Oval Office with the president for the announcement, said Mr. Trump's threat of 100% tariffs on drugs manufactured outside the U.S. motivated his company to take swift action. The president said Pfizer's drug prices will be lower starting \"immediately.\"",
      "The president said the cost of some Pfizer drugs could see decreases in price of 50%-100%. Mr. Trump said this would save American consumers and taxpayers \"hundreds of millions of dollars a year.\" The president said Americans have been \"subsidizing research and development costs for the entire planet\" because of the higher prices they have been paying.",
      "\"We're also announcing that moving forward, all new medications introduced by Pfizer to the American market will be sold at the reduced 'most favored nation' cost,\" the president added. \"So, we'll be paying essentially what other countries are paying, who have been much lower \u2014 much, much lower for many, many years.\"",
      "Neither Pfizer nor the White House has released specific drug prices yet.",
      "Some health policy experts cautioned that pricing details are still unclear and the impact for consumers may be limited.",
      "Darius Lakdawalla, chief scientific officer at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center, pointed out that Medicaid's prices are already lower than average in the U.S.",
      "\"Medicaid already enjoys 'best-price' protection in the sense that they receive the lowest prices charged to any commercial payer in the United States. Therefore, we are starting out at prices well below the averages seen in the U.S. market,\" he told CBS News.",
      "And those patients have been benefiting, says Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the Program on Medicare Policy at\u00a0KFF, a nonpartisan health policy organization: \"It is still very unclear how the price reductions announced today will lower costs directly for many people, since people on Medicaid typically don't pay large amounts out of pocket for drugs.\"",
      "Sean Sullivan, a health economist at the University of Washington, said: \"The direct-to-patient stuff is, in my view, a sideshow and branding opportunity for Trump. Most patients have drug coverage. \u2026 Very few are going to buy medications with cash, unless the drug is not a covered benefit, like weight loss or erectile dysfunction drugs.\"",
      "Bourla called it a \"historic day\" because the agreement would be reversing an \"unfair situation.\"",
      "\"For years, other rich nations refused to pay their fair share for medical innovation,\" Bourla said. \"And as a result, Americans had to assume disproportionate costs.\"",
      "The Pfizer agreement is a part of the White House agenda to secure \"most favored nation\" pricing with pharmaceutical manufacturers. In May, Mr. Trump signed an executive order\u00a0calling on\u00a0drugmakers to lower their prices and bring them in line with what other high-income countries pay for the same drugs. He threatened to subject them to steep caps on how much they can earn from Medicare if they failed to do so.",
      "Monday was the deadline for drugmakers to reach agreements to bring down drug costs, the Post reported, after the president's May executive order. While the U.S. has less than 5% of the world's population and uses about 13% of the world's prescription drugs, the U.S. funds over 70% of global pharmaceutical profits, according to the White House.",
      "The president's announcement comes days after he announced that on Wednesday, the U.S. would begin imposing a 100% tariff on any branded or patented pharmaceutical product \"unless a Company IS BUILDING their Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plant in America.\" That move could increase the costs of some drugs for consumers.",
      "Bourla mentioned the impending tariffs in his comments Tuesday, saying the tariffs had motivated his company. He said the Mr. Trump gave Pfizer a three-year grace period on the tariffs, and the tariffs would be inapplicable, as long as Pfizer manufactures in the U.S. As a part of the agreement, Bourla said Pfizer agreed to move their production of medicines used in America to the U.S.",
      "\"The president is absolutely right, tariff is the most powerful tool to motivate behaviors, Mr. President,\" Bourla said. \"And clearly motivated ours, right?\"",
      "Mr. Trump also said the tariffs had \"played a big role\" in the deal.",
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said more details of agreements by pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices will come this fall. Mr. Trump echoed that point, saying other companies are on board, too.",
      "\"President Trump is doing more to lower healthcare costs than anyone else in Washington, D.C.,\" said White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai ahead of the president's announcement. \"While Democrats are threatening to shut down the government to subsidize health care for illegal aliens, President Trump is leveraging the power of the federal government to drastically cut drug prices for everyday Americans. Democrats talked the talk for decades about drug prices, but only President Trump is actually walking the walk.\"",
      "The details of the \"TrumpRx\" website have not yet been shared, but a senior administration official expected the website to be live in early 2026.",
      "The announcement comes as Democrats remain at an impasse with the president and Republicans over keeping the government funded beyond midnight: they say the president is not doing enough to lower health care prices, and they've been pushing for an extension of the Affordable Care Act before premiums increase for many who have health care through the ACA.",

    "summary": "A government shutdown began on Wednesday. Here's what to know about student loans, educational funding and the FAFSA.",
    "story": [
      "A government shutdown on Wednesday could have the potential to disrupt a multitude of federal activities \u2014 but people with student loans are expected to continue making their repayments, according to the U.S. Department of Education.",
      "People with student loans \"will still be required to make payments on their outstanding student debt,\" the Education Department said in a Sept. 28 contingency plan for an Oct. 1 federal shutdown.",
      "While loans are still due for repayment, it could be hard to reach someone at the Education Department if a problem arises, given that most of its employees are scheduled to be furloughed in the event of a shutdown, said Persis Yu, managing counsel at Protect Borrowers, an advocacy group for people with student loans.",
      "\"Student loan borrowers will still need to pay their bills during a shutdown,\" Yu told CBS News. \"However, if things go wrong with their servicer, which they often do, borrowers are going to have fewer people to turn to to get those errors resolved.\"",
      "There would also likely be little impact on federal aid, such as loans and grants, for students who are currently enrolled in colleges and university programs because most payments are disbursed at the start of the academic year, according to a statement from the American Council on Education, a higher-education advocacy group.",
      "Still, some borrowers and students in the applications stage could encounter hurdles during a shutdown, the group added.",
      "\"Borrowers seeking assistance from [the Education Department] may face delays, and loan forgiveness applications could be impacted if the shutdown persists,\" the American Council on Education said.",
      "The Education Department operates the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which is aimed at helping public workers \u2014 such as teachers and police officers \u2014 discharge their federal student loans after they've served in government or not-for-profit organizations for more than 10 years.",
      "The DOE also runs income-driven repayment plans that provide forgiveness after 20 - 25 years of repayment.",
      "About 2,100 of the Education Department's roughly 2,400 employees are expected to be furloughed in the event of a government shutdown, according to the agency's contingency plan. Those include most of the agency's Office of Federal Student Aid, the plan shows.",
      "Could Pell Grants or the FAFSA be impacted?",
      "The Education Department said it would continue to disburse student aid such as Pell Grants and Federal Direct Student loans in the event of a shutdown because those programs are funded through mandatory spending or carryover appropriations, and therefore don't require approval from Congress.",
      "\"More than 9.9 million students receive student aid, in the form of grants and loans, at approximately 5,400 schools through these programs,\" the agency noted.",
      "The DOE said it plans to use permanent appropriations to continue processing student aid requests through the Free Applications for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, which opened on Sept. 24 for the 2026-27 academic year. The FAFSA is used by parents and students to apply for loans, grants and work-study funds to pay for college or career training programs.",
      "\"FAFSA applications actually opened early, with the form becoming fully available as of Sept. 24,\" rather than the traditional opening day of Oct. 1, NerdWallet lending expert Kate Wood told CBS News. \"Students shouldn't expect delays or for deadlines to be pushed back. Unless the Education Department says otherwise, there's no reason to wait to file the FAFSA.\"",
      "Funding for Title I and IDEA grants, which are for low-income schools and disabled students, respectively, would also continue to be available, it added.",
      "Likewise, most GI Bill benefits for students who are veterans should also continue without disruption if the government shuts down because the program is funded by mandatory spending that doesn't need to be re-approved by Congress, according to the American Council on Education, which cited the Department of Veterans Affairs' contingency plan.",
      "\"However, some delays [for ex-military students] could arise if the shutdown is prolonged or if students require additional verification, corrections or appeals during the lapse,\" the ACE noted.",
      "It added, \"In previous shutdowns, VA has experienced backlogs in claims processing and a slowdown in support services due to furloughed staff and reduced system capacity.\"",
      "What Education Department activities would be impacted?",
      "New grants would be halted during a government shutdown, the Education Department noted. But since most grants are awarded over the summer, only a small number of recipients would likely be impacted, it added.",
      "\"Grantees will continue to be able to draw down funds from these awards and, therefore, the impacts on schools and students should be minimal,\" the agency said. \"The Office for Civil Rights would pause its review and investigations of civil rights complaints.\"",

    "story": [
      "At just 23, Jacob Palmer is already running his own electrical company. He launched the business in 2024 after starting in the field as an apprentice electrician, a career path he embarked on when college turned out not to be for him.",
      "Palmer has no regrets about his decision to forego college and instead establish himself as a tradesman. \"I am very happy doing what I am doing now because it has given me the opportunity to work for myself and be independent,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Experts say the skilled trades \u2014 jobs like electricians, plumbers, welders, masons, HVAC technicians and other occupations requiring extensive training and often licensing \u2014 are attracting a growing number of young people put off by high tuition costs.",
      "More than 57% of Gen Zers surveyed by Jobber, a software tool for service businesses, cite student loan debt as a concern about going to college, according to the company's annual report on attitudes toward blue-collar jobs.",
      "More recently, signs that\u00a0artificial intelligence is starting to gobble up the kind of entry-level jobs that once went to young college graduates are also leading young workers to consider the trades. Some 77% of Gen Zers say it's important that their future job is hard to automate, with many pointing to professions like carpenter, plumber, and electrician as occupations they believe are safe from automation. By contrast, they see less security in fields like software development, data analytics, and accounting, according to the survey.",
      "\"That route is losing some of the stigma,\" said David Asay, president of Advantage Reline, a trenchless pipe rehabilitation company in Mesa, Arizona. \"The perception among that younger group is no longer, 'Oh, you're working construction, you didn't go to school?' It's, 'What a cool skillset. You're making a good career path.'\"",
      "Harder path for college grads",
      "For decades, many young people shunned the trades, with everyone from economists and career experts to politicians and parents emphasizing the importance of obtaining a college diploma. That conventional wisdom isn't entirely wrong \u2014 it's just behind the times.",
      "\"The attitude was that jobs in the trades were less than desirable,\" said Angie Hicks, co-founder of Angi, an online home improvement services guide told CBS News.",
      "But several factors are contributing to a shift in how people are thinking about such occupations. For one, going to college for many Americans often requires going into debt. The average cost of college, including tuition and room and board, now tops\u00a0$38,000 a year and is approaching $60,000 for private institutions, according to the Education Data Initiative.",
      "Factoring in the added burden of interest on student loans and potential income one foregoes while in school, the total cost of earning a bachelor's degree can exceed $500,000, the research firm has found.",
      "More recently, economists also point to a jump in unemployment for recent college grads, which some experts say is an early warning sign that AI is taking jobs away from less experienced workers. The jobless rate for 23-to-27-year-old college grads this year now hovers around 4.6%, up from 3.2% for the same demographic in 2019.",
      "Strikingly, non-college-educated workers in the same age range have experienced a much smaller uptick in unemployment, at roughly 0.5%, over the same period, according to an analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "\"AI can't go out in the field\"",
      "Vinnie Curcie, founder and CEO of OC Solar, a solar installation company in Irvine, California, said the solar energy field differs from other trades in that the work requires time both in the office and in the field. OC Solar offers three main services \u2014 solar panel and battery sales, project management and installation services. But he expects AI will soon handle much of the sales and project management sides of the business.",
      "While prospective employees once tended to have stronger interest in the company's marketing, management or other white-collar roles, more job candidates today are eager for roles in the field.",
      "\"More people are interested in the field because they know that's where the job security is,\" Curcie told CBS News.",
      "Some school districts also report seeing growing student interest in blue-collar careers. Marlo Loria, director of career and technical education and innovative partnerships at Mesa Public Schools in Mesa, Arizona, said more of her students are enrolling in schools' welding, construction and auto shop programs than there is space for.",
      "Asay, of Advantage Reline, added that students with an entrepreneurial bent can also be well-suited for the skilled trades.",
      "\"They can take their skills and create their own business, or become a bigger part of our business, outside of being someone with a shovel in a trench,\" he said.",
      "Palmer said his business generated $90,000 in revenue in its first year and is on track to top $150,000 in 2025, a more than 30% increase \u2014 no college degree needed. The other upside to life as an electrician, as he sees it, is the job security.",
      "\"I don't feel overly threatened by the growth of AI in my industry. That will be a pretty impressive robot that can do my job one day, if it ever happens,\" Palmer said.",
      "Kayden Evans, an 18-year-old senior at Mountain View High School in Mesa, Arizona, has his eyes set on a career working with his hands, and to eventually start his own business. Currently an intern at Empire Cat, a company that sells, rents and services heavy equipment and tractors, he plans on going straight from high school into an apprenticeship with the company.",
      "\"I wouldn't say I am worried about AI because where I want to grow is as a field technician, and even though it helps, I don't think AI can take that over,\" he said. \"AI can't go out in the field and take apart an engine.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 29 Sep 2025 17:59:16 -0400",
    "summary": "ChatGPT has rolled out a series of new parental controls that can limit how teenagers interact with the chatbot, OpenAI announced Monday.",
    "story": [
      "OpenAI, the company that developed ChatGPT,\u00a0announced\u00a0new parental controls on Monday aimed at helping protect young people who interact with its generative artificial intelligence program.",
      "All ChatGPT users will have access to the control features from Monday onward, the company said.",
      "The announcement comes as OpenAI, which technically allows users as young as 13 to sign up, contends with mounting public pressure to prioritize the safety of ChatGPT for teenagers. (OpenAI says on its website that it requires users ages 13 to 18 to obtain parental consent before using ChatGPT.)",
      "In August, the California-based technology company pledged to implement changes to its flagship product after facing\u00a0a wrongful death lawsuit\u00a0by parents of a 16-year-old who alleged the chatbot led their son to take his own life.",
      "OpenAI's new controls will allow parents to link their own ChatGPT accounts to the accounts of their teenagers \"and customize settings for a safe, age-appropriate experience,\" OpenAI said in Monday's announcement. Certain types of content are then automatically restricted on a teenager's linked account, including graphic content, viral challenges, \"sexual, romantic or violent\" role-play, and \"extreme beauty ideals,\" according to the company.",
      "Along with content moderation, parents can opt to receive a notification from OpenAI should their child exhibit potential signs of harming themselves while interacting with ChatGPT.",
      "\"If our systems detect potential harm, a small team of specially trained people reviews the situation,\" the company said. \"If there are signs of acute distress, we will contact parents by email, text message and push alert on their phone, unless they have opted out.\"",
      "The company also said it is \"working on the right process and circumstances in which to reach law enforcement or other emergency services\" in emergencies where a teen may be in imminent danger and a parent cannot be reached.",
      "\"We know some teens turn to ChatGPT during hard moments, so we've built a new notification system to help parents know if something may be seriously wrong,\" OpenAI said.",
      "OpenAI has introduced other measures recently aimed at helping safeguard younger ChatGPT users. The company said earlier this month that chatbot users identified as being under 18 will automatically be directed to a version that is governed by \"age-appropriate\" content rules.",
      "\"The way ChatGPT responds to a 15-year-old should look different than the way it responds to an adult,\" the company said at the time.",
      "It noted on Monday, however, that while guardrails help, \"they're not foolproof and can be bypassed if someone is intentionally trying to get around them.\"",
      "People can use ChatGPT without creating an account, and parental controls and automatic content limits only work if users are signed in.",
      "\"We will continue to thoughtfully iterate and improve over time,\" the company said. \"We recommend parents talk with their teens about healthy AI use and what that looks like for their family.\"",
      "The Federal Trade Commission has started an inquiry into several social media and artificial intelligence companies, including OpenAI, about the potential harms to teens and children who use their chatbots as companions.",

      "About 58 million pounds of corn dogs and other sausage-on-a-stick products are being recalled across the U.S. because pieces of wood may be embedded in the batter, with several consumers reporting injuries to date.",
      "According to a Saturday notice published by the Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service, the recall covers select State Fair corn dogs and Jimmy Dean \"Pancakes & Sausage On a Stick\" and \"French Toast & Sausage On a Stick\" products from Texas-based Hillshire Brands, which is a subsidiary of Tyson Foods.",
      "The contamination problem was discovered after Hillshire received multiple consumer complaints, the service notes, five of which involved injuries. The company later determined that a \"limited number\" of these products included \"extraneous pieces of wooden stick within the batter,\" Tyson said in a corresponding announcement, adding that it opted to initiate a recall \"out of an abundance of caution.\"",
      "The recalled corn dogs and sausage-on-a-stick goods were produced between March 17 and as recently as Friday, per Saturday's recall notices. Tyson, which is headquartered in Arkansas, said the issue was isolated to one facility located in Haltom City, Texas.",
      "FSIS is worried that some of these recalled products may be in consumers' refrigerators and freezers in households across the U.S., as well as some schools and other institutions. In addition to being sold online and to retailers nationwide, the agency noted Saturday, these products were also sold to school districts and Defense Department facilities.",
      "Consumers in possession of the recalled items are urged to throw them away or return them to their place of purchase.",
      "To determine which corn dogs and other sausage goods are subject to this recall, consumers should check the product's name, use-by dates and other identifying information published online by the FSIS and Tyson. The products being recalled should also have an establishment number of \"EST-582\" or \"P-894\" printed on the packaging.",
      "It's unclear if consumers who purchased these now-recalled products will be eligible for a refund. The FSIS says consumers with questions about the recall can contact Christina Self, The Hillshire Brands Company Associate Director of Customer Care, at 888-747-7611.",
      "Foreign object contamination is one of the top reasons for food recalls in the U.S. Beyond plastic, metal fragments, bits of bugs and more \"extraneous\" materials have prompted recalls by making their way into packaged goods.",

    "summary": "Newspapers announced John D. Rockefeller as the first U.S. billionaire 109 years ago. Today there are more than 900 American billionaires.",
    "story": [
      "On Sept. 29, 1916, it was front page news that a surge in Standard Oil's stock price likely made oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller America's first billionaire.",
      "More than a century later, the United States is home to hundreds of billionaires whose fortunes increasingly come from technology and financial markets. Together, they control a growing share of the country's wealth \u2014 approaching the percentage held by Gilded Age industrialists who built monopolies in railroads, oil and steel.",
      "Here's what research tells us about America's billionaire class today.",
      "American billionaires number over 900, according to researchers",
      "There are a few different estimates of the number of American billionaires, but researchers tend to agree that the billionaire class exceeds 900 and is growing.",
      "Forbes, which has produced a list of billionaires since the 1980s, counted roughly 900 in early 2025 \u2014 up from 813 in 2024.",
      "Meanwhile, the wealth-data firm Altrata pinned the number of U.S. billionaires at 1,135 in 2024, an uptick from 1,050 in 2023 and up more than 80% from levels in 2016, when they began releasing yearly reports.",
      "And JP Morgan Chase Private Bank estimated the number at roughly 1,990 in 2024 \u2014 about 15% more than its 2023 estimate.",
      "Part of the reason estimates vary is that the ultra-wealthy are not required or incentivized to disclose their net worth. The SEC requires investors to report ownership of more than 5% of a company's shares, but valuations fluctuate with the market, complicating wealth estimates.",
      "Adjusted for inflation, the number of billionaires with a Rockefeller-sized fortune is a much smaller set.",
      "His $1 billion in 1916 would be worth roughly $30 billion today. By that measure, only about 30 American billionaires have a similar fortune, according to Forbes and\u00a0Bloomberg. Among them are Oracle founder Larry Ellison and Tesla founder Elon Musk, with net worths above $300 billion. Other tech titans also top the list, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos \u2014 both with fortunes of over $200 billion each, as of Sept. 29.",
      "Christopher Nichols, a professor of history at Ohio State University said, \"The billionaires of the Gilded Age and the multimillionaires were involved in what we think of as blue chip industries, where there are lots of jobs and stuff produced. The billionaires of today's world are mostly working in tech sectors and places that very often don't employ many people.\"",
      "Billionaires have roughly $6.8 trillion in wealth in 2025",
      "Together, America's billionaires had an approximate total net worth of $6.8 trillion in the spring of 2025, Forbes estimates, which is a jump of more than a trillion compared to last year after a strong year of growth for U.S. stocks in 2024.",
      "In the 20th century, Scottish journalist B.C. Forbes, who founded the eponymous magazine, wrote that if Rockefeller's wealth \"could be turned into cash and distributed equally\u2014which it couldn't\u2014[it] would give every man, woman and child in the United States $10 each.\"",
      "Today, if that estimated $6.8 trillion held by U.S. billionaires could be turned into cash and divided equally among roughly 340 million Americans, it would amount to about $20,000 per person.",
      "Another way to think about that sum is that it could theoretically be used to buy every NFL team, pay off Americans' student loan and medical debt\u00a0and purchase 9 million homes at the current median sales price, with hundreds of billions left over.",
      "The ultra rich own an increasingly large share of the nation's wealth",
      "Data from the World Inequality Database shows that the share of wealth held by the top 1% and the ultra-rich top 0.001% has been rising for decades \u2014 toward the record levels observed in the Gilded Age.",
      "The share of the national wealth held by the top 1% peaked at nearly 50% in 1929 before tumbling during the Great Depression, according to the data.",
      "\"What happened with the Great Depression was that large fortunes were lost in the stock market. And then the New Deal rebuilt the economy around workers and around small businesses,\" said Jeremi Suri, a professor of history and public affairs at University of Texas.",
      "But in the early 1980s, the top 1% began regaining ground, as union jobs declined and traditional industries like manufacturing shrunk, according to Suri.",
      "By 2023 the top 1%, or those with over $4.6 million in assets, controlled more than a third of the nation's wealth \u2014 up over 10 percentage points from 1980.",
      "Data collected by the same researchers shows that the trendline looks similar for those in the top 0.001% of people in the country \u2014 or those who owned more than $1.5 billion in 2023.",
      "The hundreds of billionaires in this category owned about 1% of the nation's net wealth in 1980 and 5% in 2023.",
      "Most billionaires are males with self-made fortunes, but a significant number inherited their money",
      "Demographically, the billionaire class still resembles J.D. Rockefeller in many ways.",
      "The vast majority of the world's billionaires are men \u2014 about 86.5% in 2025, according to Forbes \u2014 and most make rather than inherit their wealth.",
      "Rockefeller himself was the son of a traveling salesman and a housewife. While his family helped him launch his career, Rockefeller built the majority of his fortune on his own, according to Nichols, an editor of \"A Companion to the Gilded Age and Progressive Era.\"",
      "\"He came from enough middle class wealth that he could get a loan from his dad to start that business, which so often is the story for business folks,\" Nichols said. \"But he made his billions through his business acumen and hard work, and then also his ruthless competitiveness in an under-regulated time.\"",
      "Research suggests inheritance plays a significant role for many wealthy people today. Roughly 30% of the world's billionaires have inherited their fortunes, according to a 2024 report by UBS, a wealth management company in Sweden. And the share in the U.S. is about a third, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Altrata data.",
      "Some of America's wealthiest heirs include Walmart's Alice, Rob and Jim Walton, and Jacqueline Mars, who owns roughly one third of the candy giant Mars founded by her grandfather.",
      "Rockefeller and his son gave away a significant amount of their money to charity but it continues to live on. And descendants of the family share a fortune valued around $10.3 billion in 2024.",

    "published": "Mon, 29 Sep 2025 05:00:16 -0400",
    "summary": "Under a new law, many Americans will have to meet a work requirement to obtain and keep their Medicaid coverage. But due to an exemption, millions living in areas of high unemployment could be spared.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of Medicaid enrollees may have a way out of the new federal work requirement \u2014 if they live in a county with high unemployment.",
      "By January 2027, President Trump's far-reaching domestic policy law will require many adult, nondisabled Medicaid enrollees in 42 states and Washington, D.C., to work or volunteer 80 hours a month or go to school.",
      "But under the law, Medicaid enrollees in counties where unemployment is at least 8% or 1.5 times the national unemployment rate could be shielded from the work requirement, if their state applies for an exemption.",
      "A new analysis by KFF shows that exemption in the GOP's work requirement could offer a reprieve to potentially millions of Americans caught in a tough spot \u2014 needing to work to secure health insurance but having trouble finding a job.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office projected the work requirement would apply to 18.5 million Medicaid enrollees, causing about 5.3 million to lose their government health coverage by 2034. CBO spokesperson Caitlin Emma confirmed to KFF Health News that analysts factored the unemployment rate exemption into their projections. Only states that expanded Medicaid under the 2010 Affordable Care Act or a special waiver must enact a work requirement, under the federal law.",
      "But how many people could be exempt depends on how the Trump administration interprets the law, in addition to whether their states' officials apply.",
      "For example, if Trump officials exempt people in counties where the unemployment rate has been above the law's thresholds for any month over a 12-month period, about 4.6 million Medicaid enrollees in 386 counties could qualify for an exemption today based on the latest unemployment data, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "That amounts to just under a quarter of all Medicaid enrollees subject to the work requirement.",
      "Under that one-month threshold, \"the impact could be fairly significant,\" said Jennifer Tolbert, a co-author of the analysis and the deputy director of KFF's Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured.",
      "But, she said, the Trump administration is more likely to adopt a stricter threshold based on average unemployment over a 12-month period. That would align with work requirements under the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the food assistance commonly known as food stamps.",
      "Only about 1.4 million Medicaid enrollees living in 158 counties could be exempted under that standard, or about 7% of the total subject to work requirements, KFF found. That's about 7% of enrollees who live in expansion states who would otherwise need to meet the new requirement.",
      "Based on the 12-month criteria, about 90% of Medicaid enrollees who could be exempted based on high unemployment reside in five states, according to KFF: California, New York, Michigan, Kentucky, and Ohio. California alone accounts for over half of those who could be exempted.",
      "The unemployment rate exemption is one of several carve-outs from the Medicaid work requirement in the GOP's law. The law also exempts parents with children under 14, people who are disabled or frail, and those who are pregnant, incarcerated, or in a substance use disorder program, among others. The high unemployment provision is different than most because it exempts people living in entire counties.",
      "Two top Republicans key to the bill's passage \u2014 House Speaker Mike Johnson and Sen. Mike Crapo, chair of the Senate Finance Committee \u2014 did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "To qualify for the Medicaid exemption, states would have to apply to the federal government on behalf of individuals in eligible counties. And if a county earned an exemption, the government would determine how long it applies.",
      "Even if the federal government grants exemptions broadly, health advocates fear some Republican-led states could balk at applying for exemptions in order to keep enrollment down, as they say has been the case with SNAP exemptions. As of 2023, 18 states did not have an exemption under the SNAP program, even though some of their residents might be eligible.",
      "\"It's not a guarantee that people can rely on,\" said Emily Beauregard, executive director of Kentucky Voices for Health, an advocacy group that intends to push for the broadest possible exemptions to help people maintain their coverage. Eastern Kentucky has several counties with perennially high unemployment.",
      "In advocating for Mr. Trump's bill, many Republicans in Washington argued that most people who gained Medicaid benefits under the Affordable Care Act should be working to get off of government assistance.",
      "But as Georgia's and Arkansas' experiences have shown, Medicaid work requirements can be costly for states to run and frustrating for enrollees to navigate. About 18,000 people in Arkansas, or nearly a quarter of the state's adults who gained Medicaid coverage through the ACA expansion, lost coverage when the state had a work requirement in 2018 and 2019. A court ended the state's work requirement program.",
      "Critics point out that most Medicaid enrollees already work or have a disability or caregiving responsibilities, and they argue the reporting requirements merely serve as a bureaucratic hurdle to obtaining and keeping coverage. Under the GOP law, enrollees' work status needs to be verified at least twice a year.",
      "Most of the coverage losses due to work requirements occur among people who work or should qualify for an exemption but nevertheless lose coverage due to red tape, research shows.",
      "Not every state must implement a work requirement under Mr. Trump's law, only those that chose to expand Medicaid coverage to more low-income people through the ACA or a federal waiver. The ACA has provided hundreds of billions in federal dollars to help states cover everyone making up to 138% of the federal poverty level \u2014 $21,597 for an individual in 2025.",
      "Forty states and Washington, D.C., took up the expansion. Georgia and Wisconsin partly expanded their Medicaid eligibility by getting a federal waiver, adding them to the list of states subject to the work requirement. These two states were not included in the KFF analysis because of a lack of county-level enrollment data.",
      "Jennifer Wagner, director of Medicaid eligibility and enrollment at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said she is pleased the law makes some exceptions for places where jobs are scarce. It could limit how many people lose coverage because of the work requirement, she said.",
      "Wagner said SNAP's unemployment rate exemption has helped millions of people avoid losing their food assistance, but its impact also depends on whether a state seeks the waiver.",
      "She is concerned the Trump administration may make it difficult for counties to get exempted under the Medicaid law.",
      "\"I'm glad it's in there as it will certainly help people, but it's still a terrible bill,\" she said. \"This will not really blunt the harm of the bill.\"",

      "After Hamas released its statement, Mr. Trump said Friday on Truth Social that he believes the group is \"ready for a lasting PEACE.\" He pushed Israel to cease hostilities in the Gaza Strip.",
      "\"Israel must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the Hostages out safely and quickly! Right now, it's far too dangerous to do that. We are already in discussions on details to be worked out,\" the president wrote.",
      "\"In light of Hamas's response, Israel is preparing to immediately implement the first phase of Trump's plan for the immediate release of all hostages,\" a statement released by Netanyahu's office early Saturday morning local time read. \"We will continue to work in full cooperation with the President and his team to end the war in accordance with the principles set forth by Israel that are consistent with President Trump's vision.\"",
      "In a separate statement, the Israel Defense Forces said that its high-level military officials held a meeting overnight, in which Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, the IDF chief of staff, \"instructed to advance readiness for the implementation of the first phase of the Trump plan for the release of the hostages.\"",
      "An Israeli political source told CBS News that the cessation of the IDF's activity in the Gaza Strip is intended to allow Hamas to begin organizing for the release of the hostages. The source added that this is not an official ceasefire that would require Hamas to return the hostages within 72 hours, as outlined in the plan.",
      "\"This is not the beginning of a withdrawal, although there may be tactical improvements for the purpose of protecting our soldiers,\" the source added. \"We are constantly examining what is happening on the ground and will not allow the terrorist organizations to try to take advantage of the opportunity and carry out a last-minute attack, or to strengthen their grip on the ground.\"",
      "The source said the negotiations are expected to begin on Sunday.",
      "Meanwhile, another source familiar with Israel's negotiation team told CBS News that it was getting ready to travel.",
      "U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, is set to travel to Egypt for the talks, a senior U.S. official confirmed to CBS News. Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, is also expected to attend. CBS News has reached out to the White House for more details.",
      "In a video posted to Truth Social later Friday, Mr. Trump called the deal \"unprecedented in many ways\" and thanked several Arab and majority Muslim countries that assisted with the deal as mediators, including Qatar and Egypt.",
      "\"This is a big day,\" Mr. Trump said in the video. \"We'll see how it all turns out. We have to get the final word down and concrete.\"",
      "In a follow-up post to Truth Social Saturday afternoon, Mr. Trump wrote: \"After negotiations, Israel has agreed to the initial withdrawal line, which we have shown to, and shared with, Hamas. When Hamas confirms, the Ceasefire will be IMMEDIATELY effective, the Hostages and Prisoner Exchange will begin, and we will create the conditions for the next phase of withdrawal, which will bring us close to the end of this 3,000 YEAR CATASTROPHE. Thank you for your attention to this matter and, STAY TUNED!\"",
      "The post included a map of what the proposed withdrawal line could look like.",
      "Also Saturday, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the second most powerful militant group in Gaza, said it accepted Hamas' response to the Trump plan. The group had previously rejected the proposal days earlier.",
      "Hamas says it's willing to release hostages, hand over control of Gaza",
      "Hamas said it is willing to release all living hostages and the remains of deceased hostages \"in accordance with the exchange formula set forth in President Trump's proposal.\" The proposal laid out by the White House called for Hamas to release all hostages taken on Oct. 7, 2023, within 72 hours, and for Israel to release 250 Palestinians serving life sentences and 1,700 other Gazans who were detained following the start of the conflict.",
      "The deal also called for an immediate end to fighting if both sides accept the deal, and for Israel's military to withdraw to an \"agreed upon line.\"",
      "Hamas also said it is willing to \"hand over the administration of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian body of independents (technocrats), based on Palestinian national consensus and with the support of Arab and Islamic parties\" \u2014 another portion of Mr. Trump's proposal.",
      "A senior Egyptian official told the AP that talks are underway for the release of hostages, as well as hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli detention. The official, who is involved in the ceasefire negotiations, also said Arab mediators are preparing for a comprehensive dialogue among Palestinians. The talks are aimed at unifying the Palestinian position toward Gaza's future.",
      "The group was less clear on other portions of the deal. The statement said some aspects of Mr. Trump's proposal \"remain linked to a comprehensive national stance, grounded in relevant international laws and resolutions.\" It said those issues will need to be discussed \"within an inclusive Palestinian national framework\" that includes Hamas.",
      "It's not clear if Hamas has agreed that it will play no role in the governance of Gaza, which was one provision of Mr. Trump's proposal.",
      "The plan, unveiled Sept. 29 by Mr. Trump and backed by Netanyahu, called for Hamas to free all remaining Israeli hostages and for the Israeli military to begin withdrawing from parts of the Gaza Strip in phases, starting with an initial withdrawal before the hostages are freed. It also proposed handing over parts of Gaza to a \"technocratic\" Palestinian committee and deploying a temporary security force backed by Arab states.",
      "Netanyahu, who joined Mr. Trump for a joint news conference at the White House when the 20-point proposal was announced, had said he supports the plan, and that if Hamas does not accept the offer, \"Israel will finish the job by itself.\"",
      "\"We're giving everybody a chance to have this done peacefully,\" Netanyahu had said, warning Hamas what would happen if they didn't agree to the proposal. \"But if Hamas rejects your plan, Mr. President, or if they supposedly accept it and then basically do everything to counter it, then Israel will finish the job by itself. This can be done the easy way or it can be done the hard way, but it will be done.\"",
      "The president told Netanyahu on Monday that if Hamas were to reject the proposal, \"you'd have our full backing to do what you would have to do.\"",
      "Mr. Trump had said his goal is to ensure a \"sustainable, long-term peace.\" The president on Monday also said he and Netanyahu were \"waiting for signatures and waiting for approvals from a lot of different countries that are involved in this.\"",
      "Israel and Hamas have been at war since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led terrorists attacked southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. Since then, Israel has waged an intense aerial bombardment and ground campaign in the Gaza Strip. More than 66,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not specify how many of the dead were civilians or militants.",

      "\"Gilbert gets two bullets to the head,\" Jones wrote. \"Spoiler: put Gilbert in the crew with the two worst people you know and he receives both bullets every time.\"",

    "story": [
      "The FBI is considering carrying out a \"showy\" arrest and perp walk of the agency's now-indicted ex-Director James Comey, and has suspended an agent who refused to participate in the plan, three sources familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "Comey was charged last week with lying to Congress and obstructing a congressional proceeding, an unprecedented move that came after President Trump publicly pressured Attorney General Pam Bondi to look into his longtime adversary. A grand jury voted to indict him on Sept. 25 and hours later, Comey was issued a summons directing him to appear in federal court in northern Virginia for an Oct. 9 arraignment. His lawyers agreed to bring him to his arraignment, two sources said.",
      "But on the same day as his indictment, FBI leadership discussed hauling Comey in instead of waiting for the ex-FBI chief to report to court on his own, a source knowledgeable about the conversations told CBS News.",
      "The source told CBS News that leadership asked for \"large, beefy\" agents to conduct an arrest of Comey \"in full kit,\" including Kevlar vests and exterior wear emblazoned with the FBI logo. It was suggested that a supervisory special agent in the violent crimes division of the FBI's Washington Field Office would be able to put together the kinds of agents who fit the bill, the source said.",
      "The agent, however, refused to participate in this plan, believing it would be inappropriate and highly unusual for a white-collar defendant like Comey, according to the source. He was then suspended for insubordination.",
      "The FBI is now actively working to put together a team to arrest Comey between now and his court appearance on Thursday, but other FBI supervisors have also refused to cooperate, said a source knowledgeable about the conversations and a law enforcement source familiar with the situation. The expectation is that the FBI will eventually find somebody.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the FBI for comment. Comey's lawyer, Patrick Fitzgerald, declined to comment to CBS News.",
      "Reuters was first to report that an FBI agent was sidelined for refusing to help with a perp walk.",
      "Law enforcement has long opted to carry out public perp walks for some defendants. The tactic is controversial, with critics arguing it undermines defendants' presumption of innocence. When Comey was the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan during George W. Bush's administration, the New York Civil Liberties Union penned a letter urging him to end the practice, saying it \"seems calculated simply to cause public humiliation and embarrassment of the accused.\"",
      "Comey's indictment marked an escalation in the almost decade-long feud between Mr. Trump and the FBI director he fired in the opening months of his first term. Mr. Trump has castigated Comey over the FBI's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, and Comey has called Mr. Trump \"morally unfit to be president.\"",
      "The charges accuse Comey of lying during a Senate hearing five years ago by falsely stating that he hadn't authorized anybody at the FBI to serve as an anonymous source in media reports about investigations into Hillary Clinton. The indictment does not make clear who he allegedly authorized to be an anonymous source, or what the leak entailed.",
      "Comey has denied wrongdoing.",
      "The charges followed days of upheaval in the U.S. Attorney's office in the Eastern District of Virginia, where Comey was indicted. The lead prosecutor in that office, Erik Siebert, resigned from the job two weeks ago, and Mr. Trump replaced him with his former personal lawyer, Lindsey Halligan. Less than a week later, Halligan asked a grand jury to indict Comey.",
      "Some staff in the office had circulated a memo that argued charges shouldn't be brought against Comey, a Justice Department source familiar with the matter told CBS News last week.",
      "The Justice Department has also fired two high-level prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia in the last two weeks, sources familiar with the matter told CBS News.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday cleared the way for the Trump administration to end temporary legal protections for more than 300,000 Venezuelan migrants.",
      "The high court agreed to freeze a lower court decision that found the Department of Homeland Security illegally terminated the Temporary Protected Status program for Venezuelan migrants, which allowed them to live and work in the U.S. without the threat of immediate deportation.",
      "By halting the September ruling from U.S. District Judge Edward Chen, the Supreme Court is allowing the Trump administration to move forward with rolling back the legal protections for Venezuelans. This is the second time the high court has green-lit the Department of Homeland Security's move to strip hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans of their temporary legal protections.",
      "\"Although the posture of the case has changed, the parties' legal arguments and relative harms generally have not,\" the Supreme Court said in an unsigned order. \"The same result that we reached in May is appropriate here.\"",
      "Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor said they would have denied the Trump administration's request for emergency relief, and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented.",
      "\"We once again use our equitable power (but not our opinion-writing capacity) to allow this Administration to disrupt as many lives as possible, as quickly as possible. I view today's decision as yet another grave misuse of our emergency docket,\" Jackson wrote in a dissenting opinion.",
      "DHS called the order a \"win for the American people and commonsense\" in a post on X.",
      "\"Temporary Protected Status was always supposed to be just that: Temporary. Yet, previous administrations abused, exploited, and mangled TPS into a de facto amnesty program,\" the agency said.",
      "The National TPS Alliance, one of the plaintiffs in the case, criticized Friday's order.",
      "\"It is heartbreaking that the justices rubber-stamped this administration's unlawful cancellation of TPS. This decision will upend the lives of hundreds of thousands of law-abiding, hard-working TPS holders like myself,\" plaintiff and National TPS Alliance member Cecilia Gonzalez, who has lived in the U.S. since 2017, said in a statement.",
      "In seeking emergency relief from the Supreme Court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer had argued that the lower court could not review Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's decision to cancel an extension of TPS status for Venezuela and then revoke the country's designation.",
      "Sauer wrote in a filing that the district court's ruling \"impedes important immigration enforcement policies\" by allowing 300,000 Venezuelan migrants to stay in the U.S. despite Noem's determination that doing so is \"contrary to the national interest.\"",
      "The Trump administration's request for emergency relief is the latest in which it has accused lower courts of ignoring Supreme Court orders issued during earlier stages of cases. In this instance, the high court in May allowed the Trump administration to end the TPS program for Venezuelans while legal proceedings moved forward. That decision stemmed from a preliminary order from Chen, who went on to decide the full merits of the case last month.",
      "The judge ruled the Trump administration's attempt to strip TPS from Venezuelans living in the U.S. was illegal. Chen wrote the Supreme Court's May decision, which he said lacked \"any specific rationale,\" did not bar him from adjudicating the case on the merits and issuing a final decision providing relief.",
      "\"This case arose from action taken post haste by the current DHS Secretary, Kristi Noem, to revoke the legal status of Venezuelan and Haitian TPS holders, sending them back to conditions that are so dangerous that even the State Department advises against travel to their home countries,\" Chen wrote in his ruling. \"The Secretary's action in revoking TPS was not only unprecedented in the manner and speed in which it was taken but also violates the law.\"",
      "But Sauer, the solicitor general, accused the district judge of disregarding the Supreme Court's earlier order, which he said was binding.",
      "\"Lower courts cannot treat this Court's orders as good for only one stage of only one case by gesturing at irrelevant distinctions, subjectively grading the persuasiveness of the Court's perceived reasoning, or faulting the Court's terseness,\" he wrote.",
      "Congress created the program known as TPS in 1990 to provide temporary immigration protections for migrants from countries beset by wars, natural disasters or other \"extraordinary and temporary\" conditions that make it dangerous for deportees to return. Migrants from a country designated for TPS cannot be removed from the U.S. and are authorized to work for the length of the designation, which can last for up to 18 months.",
      "The Biden administration designated Venezuela for TPS in March 2021, and it was later extended. Then-Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas also re-designated Venezuela for TPS.",
      "But after the second Trump administration came into power, Noem canceled her predecessor's extension and then rescinded the program for Venezuela, finding that allowing migrants to temporarily stay in the U.S. would be \"contrary to the national interest.\" The secretary said that the TPS program had allowed a significant number of Venezuelan migrants without a path to legal immigration status to settle in the U.S., straining local resources.",
      "The Trump administration urged Venezuelans shielded through the program to self-deport before the protections would end in April.",
      "But in February, a group of TPS beneficiaries and the National TPS Alliance challenged the Trump administration's move and sought to have the legal protections reinstated. They succeeded in securing preliminary relief in March and then prevailed on the merits last month.",
      "The Trump administration asked a federal appeals court to pause the district court's decision while it appealed, but the request was denied.",
      "In its bid for emergency relief from the Supreme Court, the Trump administration said federal immigration law forbids courts from second-guessing Noem's decision to end the TPS program for Venezuela.",
      "\"[T]he Secretary determined that even a six-month extension of TPS would harm the United States' 'national security' and 'public safety,' while also straining police stations, city shelters, and aid services in local communities that had reached a breaking point,\" Sauer wrote. \"Moreover, delay of the Secretary's decisions threatens to undermine the United States' foreign policy, which involves complex negotiations with Venezuela.\"",
      "But lawyers for the plaintiffs, led by the National TPS Alliance, called the Trump administration's assertion that the district judge ignored the Supreme Court's earlier order \"baseless and dangerous.\"",
      "They also said that the Supreme Court's earlier order, which allowed the administration to end the temporary deportation protections, caused significant harm to Venezuelans.",
      "\"People lost their jobs, were jailed, and ultimately deported to a country that remains extremely unsafe,\" lawyers wrote in a Supreme Court filing. \"The summary judgment order below has provided respite from that harm by restoring the status quo. Disturbing it now will cause massive injuries to Plaintiffs and their loved ones, including many American children.\"",
      "The TPS beneficiaries told the court that Noem has exercised \"unprecedented authority to vacate a TPS extension at any time, for any reason,\" which they said violates the TPS system created by Congress.",
      "Since President Trump returned to the White House, his administration has sought to end programs allowing certain migrants to live and work in the U.S. The Supreme Court has allowed many of the president's immigration policies to move forward, including its cancellation of a program benefiting roughly 500,000 Cubans, Nicaraguans, Haitians and Venezuelans.",

      "There's widespread apprehension among Americans: They overwhelmingly decry political violence, saying it is unacceptable.",
      "Yet they also think it will increase in the coming years.",
      "Notably, Americans of all political stripes say violence is unacceptable; there's no meaningful difference between views of partisans on this. There are some differences according to age, though, with older Americans especially likely to call political violence unacceptable, and they do almost universally.",
      "This concern is not entirely new and has even increased over recent years.",
      "Concern over political violence also relates to a majority's pessimism that people of different political stripes can come together.",
      "It does, however, stand in contrast to a generally positive view that most hold about people, apart from politics: that they do get along, but that politics drives them apart.",
      "Older Americans are more likely to think people get along than younger ones. This may be a generational difference, marked by more time spent before a hyper-partisan era; older Americans are even more likely than younger ones to say civility has gotten worse over time.",
      "At the same time, we aren't all talking to each other.",
      "Fewer than half feel comfortable publicly expressing political views. Half the public says they almost never have a political discussion with someone who holds different views. Most say they never have such an interaction online (perhaps because people can readily self-select into groups that agree with them.) And only one in 10 hold such conversations a lot.",
      "The number who report talking in person to people with different political views is lower than it was four years ago.",
      "That may be partly because there's a perception about negative outcomes for people who do express views publicly.",
      "In general, most think doing so can lead to insults, to threats, or employment problems just as much \u2014 if not more than \u2014 more positive outcomes, like finding others who share those views, or building support.",
      "Majorities of Americans of all ages and across the political spectrum say they don't feel American culture and society respects them. But those who are more comfortable publicly expressing political opinions are more likely to feel that society does respect them.",
      "Relatedly, big majorities across party lines say the tone and civility of politics has gotten worse. This, too, is not new. Americans have overwhelmingly felt this in recent years, when asked.",
      "When partisans look at the other side of the aisle, do they see political opposition, or enemies? Mostly, it's opposition, not enemies. But that's not universal. Just under half of Democrats say Republicans, when they win, threaten their way of life, much as they said four years ago. Just over a third of Republicans see Democrats as enemies, and that's a little fewer than thought so four years ago; at the time, Democrats had more sway in Washington than they do today.",
      "And in sum, there is majority pessimism right now that Americans can put aside political views and work out their differences. That pessimism spans party lines, though Republicans are relatively more optimistic than Democrats - and younger Americans are somewhat more optimistic than older ones.",

      "In court, Roske briefly spoke, apologizing to Justice Kavanaugh.",
      "\"I sincerely apologize to the justice and his family for the considerable distress I have put them through,\" Roske said, adding she was sorry for \"contributing to the fear that judges feel while doing their job.\"",
      "Roske continued, calling her actions \"selfish and misguided,\" before adding, \"I have been portrayed as a monster, and this tragic mistake I have made will follow me the rest of my life.\"",
      "In September, prosecutors asked that Roske face at least 30 years in prison for attempting the \"preplanned, coldblooded murder\" of Kavanaugh at his home in 2022. Roske was seen by U.S. Marshals getting out of a cab near Kavanaugh's home in the early morning hours before walking up the street away from the home. But Roske then called an emergency line and reported having suicidal thoughts and a firearm in a suitcase. Roske then told the operator of coming from California to kill a \"specific United States Supreme Court justice,\" according to a court filing.",
      "Roske was then detained without incident, in possession of a black tactical chest rig and tactical knife, a Glock 17 pistol with two magazines and ammunition, pepper spray, zip ties, a hammer, screwdriver, nail punch, crow bar, pistol light, duct tape, hiking boots with padding on the outside of the soles, and other items, an affidavit said.",
      "In her plea agreement, Roske admitted to traveling from California, where she lived at the time, to Maryland, to attack Kavanaugh and, according to federal prosecutors, aimed to kill three members of the Supreme Court in order to \"single-handedly alter the constitutional order for ideological ends.\"",
      "Roske, prosecutors said Friday, had \"ramped up\" plans for the attack after the leak of a draft of the Supreme Court decision ending the federal right to an abortion and leaving questions about its legality to the states.",
      "\"The defendant researched; planned; procured the tools for the planned killings; traveled across the entirety of the country with those tools, including a gun; and attempted to delete online evidence of motive and intent,\" prosecutors wrote in their sentencing memorandum.",
      "\"The defendant's objective \u2014 to target and kill judges to seek to alter a court's ruling \u2014 is an abhorrent form of terrorism and strikes at the core of the United States Constitution and our prescribed system of government,\" the government said.",
      "Roske also conducted Google searches for \"how much force do you need to stab someone's neck,\" \"most effective way to silently kill someone\" and \"how to break a lock,\" according to the sentencing memorandum.",
      "Prosecutors said that a map saved in Roske's Google account contained pins that marked what Roske believed were the homes of four sitting Supreme Court justices. The Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority.",
      "During Friday's sentencing hearing, federal prosecutors displayed some of the materials Roske possessed when arrested, including zip ties, a tactical vest with pepper spray and a knife, a lock-pick set and a hammer.",
      "Justice Department prosecutor Coreen Mao said Friday that Roske's \"singular, focused mission\"\u00a0 was \"terrorism\" and she had aimed to \"affect the conduct of government,\" citing Roske's statements to law enforcement after arrest and internet searches for information about Supreme Court justices.",
      "Roske's attorneys did not dispute their client's actions leading up to the planned attack, but cited her yearslong history of mental health issues and an attempted suicide as context to her behavior in planning the attack. Roske's attorneys asked for a sentence of eight years in prison and 25 years of supervised release.",
      "Earlier this month, Roske wrote a letter to Boardman apologizing to Justice Kavanaugh for her actions.",
      "\"I put them through a harrowing experience and for that I am truly sorry. I am very glad I did not continue,\" Roske wrote. \"I am also sorry for contributing to a trend of political violence in American politics.\"",

    "summary": "No one was hurt when two vessels that were part of a flotilla bound for Gaza mysteriously caught fire last month.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directly approved military operations on two vessels early last month that were part of a Gaza-bound flotilla carrying aid and pro-Palestinian supporters, including Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, CBS News has learned.",
      "Two American intelligence officials briefed on the matter told CBS News that Israeli forces on Sept. 8 and 9 launched drones from a submarine and dropped incendiary devices onto the boats that were moored outside the Tunisian port of Sidi Bou Said, causing a fire. The officials spoke under the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on national security matters.",
      "Under international humanitarian law and the law of armed conflict, the use of incendiary weapons against a civilian population or civilian objects is prohibited in all circumstances.",
      "Israel has enforced a naval blockade of the Gaza Strip for more than a decade, first declaring the restriction in January 2009, when its navy announced the closure of the coastal waters to all maritime traffic. The move came some two years after Hamas took control of the region following a brief but violent civil war with the rival Fatah party, the political and military organization of Arab Palestinians, officially known as the Palestinian National Liberation Movement.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces didn't respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "The Global Sumud Flotilla organized the international maritime initiative that aims to break through Israel's naval blockade of Gaza and provide aid to the war-torn territory.",
      "On Sept. 8, an incendiary device was dropped onto the Family, a Portuguese-flagged vessel. The Global Sumud Flotilla told CBS News that on the night prior to the attack, Portuguese lawmaker Mariana Mort\u00e1gua was on board. The activists believe the perpetrators deliberately waited until \"elected officials or high-profile figures were absent,\" the group said in a statement to CBS News on Friday.",
      "On Sept. 9, the Alma, a British-flagged vessel, was attacked in a similar manner as the Family. In both cases, the group said last month that the boats were damaged by the fire but the crew was able to extinguish the flames quickly. No one was killed or injured.",
      "\"Confirmation of Israeli involvement would not surprise us; it would simply lay bare a pattern of arrogance and impunity so grotesque that it cannot escape eventual reckoning,\" the Global Sumud Flotilla said in its statement Friday.",
      "The statement added: \"Whether the purpose of these attacks was to kill us, scare us away, or disable our boats, they recklessly endangered civilians and humanitarian volunteers. The world must take note: attempts to silence, intimidate, or obstruct our commitment to the Palestinian cause and people will not succeed. We call for urgent, independent investigations into these attacks and full accountability for those responsible.\"",
      "In September, Tunisian authorities disputed that drones dropping incendiary devices caused the fire, instead claiming that an initial inspection indicated the explosion originated inside the boat, according to BBC News. Pro-Israeli accounts on social media claimed the fires were started after the activists did not use a flare gun properly.",
      "Footage released by the Global Sumud Flotilla and obtained by CBS News appears to show a ball of flames falling onto the boat, sparking the fire on board, instead of the fire originating from inside the vessel. The stationary cameras affixed to the vessels do not capture where the flames originated from prior to landing on the boat nor do they depict a flare gun being fired.",
      "In separate incidents in late September, the activist group said they were attacked by 15 low-altitude drones while sailing south of Greece. The Global Sumud Flotilla said at least 13 explosions were heard on and around several flotilla boats and objects were dropped on at least 10 boats, causing damage. While no casualties were reported, the activist group said that their communications systems were also disrupted.",
      "This week, Israeli naval forces intercepted most of the vessels bound for Gaza, detaining dozens of activists along with Thunberg and several European lawmakers, a move that drew swift international criticism.",
      "American citizens travelling on the flotilla have also been detained by Israel. A State Department official told CBS News that the department was monitoring the situation and is committed to providing assistance to U.S. citizens. The official also called the flotilla a \"deliberate and unnecessary provocation,\" particularly as the Trump administration continues to seek a negotiated solution to end the war in Gaza.",
      "Two Americans sailing with the Global Sumud Flotilla include Marine Corps veteran Jessica Clotfelter and Greg Stoker, organizer of the veterans' delegation to the group. On Wednesday, they spoke via Zoom to CBS News Chicago roughly an hour before the Israeli navy intercepted the flotilla.",
      "\"We are a civilian aid mission, trying to break the siege into Gaza, and we are carrying humanitarian aid in accordance with international humanitarian and maritime law,\" said Stoker.",
      "Clotfelter told CBS News Chicago that the images that have been coming out of Gaza for the last two years have been \"heartbreaking\" and \"gut-wreching.\"",
      "She added: \"I mean, I've cried probably every single day on this boat as the violence since we've taken off on 31 August has escalated.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Friday became the latest court to determine the Trump administration's effort to end birthright citizenship\u00a0is likely unconstitutional.",
      "In a 100-page ruling, the First Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a Boston district court's injunction that blocked the government from enforcing an\u00a0executive order\u00a0signed by President Trump to significantly narrow birthright citizenship, the concept that people born in the U.S. are automatically citizens, regardless of their parents' immigration status. The appeals court ruled in favor of plaintiff states and against the Trump administration.",
      "Other cases\u00a0challenging the president's effort to restrict birthright citizenship have been making their way through the courts, and they haven't been decided in the president's favor.",
      "\"Our nation's history of efforts to restrict birthright citizenship \u2014 from Dred Scott in the decade before the Civil War to the attempted justification for the enforcement of the Chinese Exclusion Act in Wong Kim Ark \u2014 has not been a proud one,\" the court's chief justice wrote. \"Indeed, those efforts each have been rejected, once by the people through constitutional amendment in 1868 and once by the court relying on the same amendment three decades later, and at a time when tensions over immigration were also high.\"",
      "\"The 'lessons of history' thus give us every reason to be wary of now blessing this most recent effort to break with our established tradition of recognizing birthright citizenship and to make citizenship depend on the actions of one's parents rather than \u2014 in all but the rarest of circumstances \u2014 the simple fact of being born in the United States,\" the appeals court concluded.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment on the ruling.",
      "In Mr. Trump's first week in office, he signed an executive order that sought to end birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants or temporary visa holders. The 14th Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1868, has long been interpreted to automatically grant citizenship to virtually everybody born on U.S. soil, even if their parents are in the country illegally or temporarily. Federal judges in several states have blocked the order from taking effect.",
      "The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to review the constitutionality of Mr. Trump's birthright citizenship executive order in two different cases, one brought by four states and another by parents whose children would be impacted by the policy.",
      "The birthright citizenship issue reached the high court earlier this year, but the justices did not rule on the merits, instead curtailing lower court judges' power to issue nationwide injunctions blocking Mr. Trump's executive order.",

    "summary": "The U.S. government is planning to give migrant teenagers a $2,500 stipend if they choose to return to their home countries voluntarily.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. government is planning to give migrant teenagers a $2,500 stipend if they choose to return to their home countries voluntarily, the latest push by the Trump administration to encourage self-deportations, according to an internal federal notice obtained by CBS News.",
      "The notice, sent Friday by officials at the Department of Health and Human Services, said the Department of Homeland Security \"will provide a one-time resettlement support stipend of $2,500 ... to unaccompanied alien children, 14 years of age and older, who have elected to voluntarily depart the United States as of the date of this notice and moving forward.\"",
      "The monetary offer would be available to unaccompanied migrant children in the custody of HHS' Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is required by law to house these minors in shelters, foster homes and other facilities until they turn 18 or they can be released to a suitable sponsor. Children from Mexico will not qualify for the $2,500 stipend.",
      "Historically, most unaccompanied children in federal care have been teenagers from Central America who crossed the U.S. southern border without authorization and without their parents or legal guardians.",
      "The notice sent by HHS Friday said the $2,500 government bonus \"is intended to support reintegration efforts following departure.\" Voluntary departure is a special legal process for unaccompanied children and all such cases need to be approved by an immigration judge.",
      "CBS News reached out to representatives for the DHS and HHS about the $2,500 offer outlined in the notice, which was first reported by CNN.",
      "ICE said the voluntary departure program is initially being offered to 17-year-olds. The agency said the \"voluntary option\" gives unaccompanied children \"a choice and allows them to make an informed decision about their future.\"",
      "\"Any payment to support a return home would be provided after an immigration judge grants the request and the individual arrives in their country of origin,\" ICE said in a statement. \"Access to financial support when returning home would assist should they choose that option.\"",
      "Melissa Adamson, an attorney at the California-based National Center for Youth Law, said unaccompanied minors \"need meaningful legal guidance, not government cash payouts, to safely weigh the option of voluntary departure.\"",
      "\"Dangling money before vulnerable children distorts this process and could endanger their lives,\" she added.",
      "The stipend is one of several efforts the Trump administration has announced to increase the number of unauthorized immigrants leaving the country, through both forced deportations and self-deportations. Over the past months, officials have been offering adult immigrants in the U.S. illegally a $1,000 self-deportation bonus if they return to their home countries, as well as travel assistance.",
      "While Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests across the country have become the most visible part of President Trump's hardline immigration agenda, his administration has simultaneously undertaken a smaller effort to remove or compel the self-deportation of unaccompanied children who entered the country without permission.",
      "Since Mr. Trump took office, HHS officials have made it harder for prospective sponsors, especially those in the U.S. illegally, to sponsor unaccompanied children out of federal custody.",
      "The Trump administration has also sought to circumvent legal protections that make it difficult to quickly deport most unaccompanied minors. Under federal law, unaccompanied children who are not from Mexico or Canada are not eligible for expedited deportations and have to see an immigration judge before any attempt by the government to deport them. During that process, many of them seek asylum or special visas for at-risk and abused youth.",
      "In late August, the administration attempted to deport more than 70 Guatemalan children, including many with active immigration cases in the U.S., arguing that their family members had asked for their return. But that effort was blocked by a federal judge as the children sat on planes ready to take off. A Guatemalan government report disclosed in the case found none of the children's parents affirmatively requested their return.",
      "Trump administration officials have also directed ICE agents to perform \"welfare checks\" on unaccompanied children released from federal care across the country, citing contested claims that the Biden administration \"lost\" thousands of migrant minors.",

      "When the government shuts down, many federal workers go without paychecks, whether they are deemed essential and required to show up for work or whether they're furloughed for the duration of the shutdown.",
      "Such employees are by law entitled to back pay once a funding agreement is reached, but independent contractors who sell goods or services to the U.S. government are not similarly protected.",
      "Dan Koh, the former chief of staff at the Labor Department under President Biden, recently said on his podcast that workers employed by companies that have contracts with the government are hurt in a shutdown.",
      "That's because there's no guarantee such workers will be paid once the government reopens, according to Koh. But even federal workers who eventually receive back pay can suffer during a shutdown, as many of them live paycheck to paycheck, he added.",
      "\"Even if you are entitled to back pay, a lot of people can't go even a couple of days without their regularly scheduled paycheck,\" he told CBS News. \"If you have to pay your subway fare, for gas, if something breaks in your home, and you're not getting paid, it places extreme stress on government employees,\" he said.",
      "Members of Congress and the President continue to receive paychecks during a shutdown.",
      "Who gets paid and who does not?",
      "Federal workers, including both furloughed and excepted government employees, receive back pay under a federal law guaranteeing that they'll eventually be made whole.",
      "The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019\u00a0states that workers who are furloughed due to a lapse in federal funding, as well as excepted workers who are considered essential and required to work without being paid, all receive back pay \"at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates.\"",
      "By contrast, workers and businesses that contract with the government are not similarly guaranteed delayed compensation.",
      "Roughly 620,000 people, or about 28% of federal workers, are projected to be furloughed during the shutdown, according to an Oxford Economics analysis of government data. Additionally, millions of private sector workers who are supported by federal grants and contracts could see their pay be affected by the shutdown, according to the economic advisory firm.",
      "The group estimates that the government supports up to an additional 10 million private workers through federal grants and contracts.",
      "In 2024, the federal government spent about $755 billion on contracts for a wide variety of goods and services, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office.",
      "\"The government is the largest buyer of goods and services, so when they are not paying, it's not ripples, it's waves,\" Aron Beezley, co-leader of the Government Contracts Practice Group at Bradley, a national law firm, told CBS News.",
      "Personnel needed to process payment",
      "Some federal contracts are fully funded, meaning the government has already allocated money to a given job, and it's likely to continue.",
      "\"If your contract is fully funded by the previous year's appropriations, your contract will go forward, generally speaking,\" he told CBS News.",
      "But even then, companies can expect snags in getting paid on schedule during a shutdown. That's because government personnel tasked with processing contractor invoices might not be at work.",
      "\"When you submit invoices during a shutdown, the system the government uses to pay contractors requires human involvement. Invoices need to be reviewed, and a lot of times a contractor has questions for the folks who process invoices,\" Beezley explained.",
      "As a result, contractors with fully funded contracts can encounter practical impediments to receiving payments they are owed.",
      "\"If nobody is home to process the invoice, it can be challenging to get paid, which can create cash flow issues, particularly for small businesses,\" Beezley said.",
      "Partially funded contracts",
      "A company with an incrementally funded government contract may find itself in a more precarious financial position. Under such contracts, the government pays a business for the work it does as a job progresses.",
      "\"During a shutdown, the funds might not be there for a contractor, and in such situations, those contractors are looking at whether they need to stop working or keep going, and try to get the government to pay them later,\" Beezley said.",
      "Even when contractors want to continue doing their jobs, they might be impeded by practical obstacles.",
      "\"Say a person who unlocks a government facility in the morning has been furloughed and a contractor shows up Monday morning and can't get into the facility \u2014 that impacts their performance,\" Beezley said.",
      "Federal agencies have the discretion to terminate such contracts, at which point a company can decide whether or not to continue paying workers, or assign them to another job.",
      "\"Most contracting companies out of goodness of heart don't keep paying janitors,\" Koh said. \"So in effect, most of them aren't getting paid.\"",
      "Attempts at legislation",

      "\"Contractor employees perform jobs that are critical to the operation of our government, providing food service, security, and doing custodial work,\" Smith said in a statement at the time. \"These are often low-wage jobs that mean workers are living paycheck to paycheck. In the past, these workers haven't received back pay at the end of a government shutdown like the thousands of government employees. And it's time we right that wrong.\"",
      "The bill failed to advance.",
      "Small businesses",

    "story": [
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has fired a top official with the National Institutes of Health who blew the whistle on internal clashes over vaccine research in the early months of the Trump administration.",
      "On Wednesday, Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo received a letter from Kennedy \u2014 which CBS News reviewed \u2014 informing her that her role leading NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or NIAID, had been terminated. He did not cite a cause beyond his constitutional authority to do so. Last month, in an exclusive interview with CBS News, Marrazzo said she had been silenced when she and her colleagues pushed back against NIH officials appointed by President Trump who questioned the importance of childhood flu vaccines and canceled long-running clinical trials.",
      "\"My termination, unfortunately, shows that the leaders of HHS and the National Institutes of Health do not share my commitment to scientific integrity and public health,\" Marrazzo wrote in a statement following her firing. \"Congress must act to protect scientific research from those who would serve political interests first.\"",
      "Marrazzo had been in her role since August 2023, succeeding Dr. Anthony Fauci, who had served as NIAID director for nearly four decades. She was put on indefinite leave in March and filed a whistleblower complaint with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel in September, alleging illegal retaliation. In a statement, Marrazzo's attorney alleged her firing is further \"retaliation for her protected whistleblower activity.\"",
      "Despite following a well-established whistleblower process by filing a complaint with OSC, recourse for Marrazzo is far from certain. Mr. Trump fired the head of the independent agency in February and has since installed his top trade official Jamieson Greer to lead the agency on an acting basis.",
      "In August, the office launched an ethics probe into Jack Smith, the former special counsel who indicted Mr. Trump before he returned to office for his actions around the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, and for allegedly mishandling classified documents from his first term.",
      "The allegations in Marrazzo's whistleblower complaint focus on Dr. Matthew Memoli, who served as acting NIH director earlier this year before moving to the health agency's No. 2 post.",
      "Marrazzo claimed Memoli made statements downplaying the importance of vaccines that closely mirrored the views of Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic. In a series of meetings, Memoli argued that \"vaccines are unnecessary if populations are healthy,\" and that the NIH \"should not focus on vaccines,\" Marrazzo alleged in her complaint.",
      "Marrazzo told CBS News it was like \"hearing the echo of\" the vaccine skepticism often promoted by Kennedy. \"It was extremely alarming,\" Marrazzo said.",
      "An HHS spokesperson defended Memoli to CBS News, writing in a statement: \"He remains fully aligned with this administration's vaccine priorities and consistently champions gold-standard evidence-based science.\"",
      "In June, Kennedy removed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Vaccine Practices, which makes vaccine recommendations to the Centers for Disease Control. He then handpicked their replacements, and the newly reconstituted panel recently voted to endorse a change in guidelines for the measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine, recommending children under 4 get them in two separate shots.",

    "summary": "With time running out to avert a government shutdown, millions of Americans who get health insurance under the Affordable Care Act could soon face sharply higher premiums.",
    "story": [
      "The dispute at the heart of the ongoing U.S. government shutdown\u00a0centers around a tax credit that helps 22 million Americans lower their health insurance costs when they buy policies through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces.",
      "Known as the enhanced premium tax credit, the subsidy has been used by millions of low- and middle-class households since it was authorized under the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021. Since then, spurred by the tax credit, the number of people who have enrolled in ACA marketplace health insurance plans has almost doubled, according to health care publication KFF.",
      "But it is set to expire at the end of 2025, and leading Democratic lawmakers are making a funding deal to keep the government open contingent on Republicans agreeing to extend the credit. A new Oct. 3 survey from health information group KFF found that three-quarters of those polled say they want Congress to extend the tax credits, with about 59% of Republicans saying they would like to see an extension.",
      "Even as the outcome of the funding negotiations in Washington, D.C., remains uncertain, expiration of the premium health care credits could inflict financial pain on millions of Americans, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"Insurers are already preparing to send notices to households that they will see increases starting in January 2026,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy at Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal economic advocacy group, and former a White House economic official under former President Joe Biden, on a conference call Friday to discuss the tax credit.",
      "He added, \"People are more and more concerned about the cost of living, and [this is] a hit to their pocketbooks that they will start seeing in weeks.\"",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the enhanced ACA premium tax credits set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "How much could ACA premiums increase?",
      "The cost of premiums for people who buy their insurance through the ACA marketplaces could more than double, rising from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to a Sept. 30 analysis by KFF. About 4 million people would likely drop their insurance coverage if the credit is allowed to expire because they would't be able to afford the costs, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The premium tax credit is aimed at people who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans, and who can't get affordable health care through an employer. The credit is available for those who earn between 100% to 400% of the poverty level, which means a family of four with annual income of up to $128,600 would qualify for the credit.",
      "With expiration of the ACA coverage credit only months away, some policy holders have already received noticed that their premiums \u2014 the monthly fee paid for insurance coverage \u2014 are poised to surge next year. Insurers have sent out notices in nearly every state, with some proposing premium increases of as much as 50%.",
      "Insurers are already planning on substantial premium hikes in 2026, according to a Peterson KFF Health System Tracker survey published last month. The poll found that 312 insurers participating in ACA marketplaces are proposing median increases of 18% next year, about 11 percentage points higher than in 2025.",
      "That increase would represent the largest rate hike since 2018, and is driven by higher costs for medical care as well as the expiration of the premium tax credits. Sharply higher ACA premiums would likely cause healthier people to drop coverage, making it more expensive to insure those who remain, the group said.",
      "The proposed hikes range from a high of 39.9%, from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma, to a low of 4.6% for Oscar Garden State Insurance Corporation, their survey found.",
      "In Iowa last month, the state's insurance commissioner weighed increases ranging from 3% to 37%, arousing public concerns. One woman who runs a garden center in Cedar Falls, Iowa, said she was considering dropping health insurance altogether.",
      "\"I am already living as frugally as I possibly can while working as hard as I possibly can, putting in as many hours as I am allowed to at my job, never missing a day of work,\" one woman, LuAnn, wrote in a comment published on the commissioner's website.",
      "Signs of financial fragility",
      "The potential hike in insurance costs comes as many Americans continue struggling with the cost of living, said Rohit Chopra, former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, on the conference call with Jacquez, organized by Groundwork, which supports extending the credits.",
      "\"Some people will need to drop their insurance all together, but households with someone with a chronic illness will have to pay those big, big increases,\" Chopra said. That would require some families to make tough financial choices, such as not paying other bills or accumulating debt to cover their expenses, he added.",
      "Although inflation around the U.S. has eased significantly since its post-pandemic peak in 2022, costs continue to inch higher. The Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target is slipping further from reach this year, with the Consumer Price Index climbing higher in recent months. Some consumers are showing signs of increasing financial stress, with credit card delinquencies on the rise and balances creeping higher.",
      "Meanwhile, many Americans aren't aware that the ACA enhanced premium tax credits will expire in a matter of months, KFF found in a survey.",
      "\"Consumers should not panic, but they do need to prepare,\" Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at insurance website Healthinsurance.org, said in an email.",
      "People should make sure to compare various plans available to them on the marketplaces and explore options such as Health Savings Plans, which allows people to set aside money to pay for medical expenses, she said.",
      "\"Being proactive will help minimize financial surprises,\" Norris said.",

    "summary": "Since launching its crackdown in Washington, D.C., the Trump administration has recorded over 3,500 arrests in the district, with nearly 1,400 strictly immigration-related.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 While President Trump billed the federal law enforcement surge in the nation's capital as an effort to crack down on violent crime, internal government data obtained by CBS News shows nearly 40% of over 3,500 arrests made since the operation began in early August were immigration-related.",
      "The federal government statistics indicate that, as of Sept. 29, federal and local law enforcement officials assigned to the Trump administration's high-profile operation in Washington, D.C., had reported making just over 3,550 arrests.",
      "Nearly 1,400 of those arrests were counted as administrative arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, the federal agency spearheading Mr. Trump's mass deportation campaign. Those arrests involve immigrants ICE seeks to deport because of alleged civil violations of federal immigration law, like entering the U.S. illegally or overstaying a visa. It's unclear how many of those arrested by ICE had criminal histories in addition to their alleged civil immigration violations.",
      "The rest of the arrests, the data indicates, had a criminal nexus. The roughly 8-week-long operation has led to the arrest of 13 homicide suspects, nearly 500 narcotics arrests and about 300 firearms-related arrests. More than two dozen of the arrests involved individuals charged with sex-related crimes.",
      "Agents and officers deployed throughout the capital have also seized over 300 illegal guns and issued roughly 650 misdemeanor citations, plus more than 300 traffic citations, according to the data.",
      "The federal figures also suggest ICE agents have visited over 130 work sites in Washington. Those visits can be precursors to investigations into whether individuals are working in the U.S. illegally.",
      "In a statement to CBS News on Thursday, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said the \"focus of President Trump's highly successful DC operation has been to address crime committed by anyone, regardless of immigration status.\"",
      "\"Many of the illegal aliens arrested during this operation were committing crimes or had outstanding warrants and prior convictions for crimes like assault, DUIs, kidnapping, drug possession, and worse including an illegal alien who had a prior arrest for raping a child,\" Abigail Jackson added.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Department of Homeland Security has released data indicating what percentage of immigration arrests in D.C. involved those who were committing crimes, had outstanding warrants or were previously charged or convicted of crimes.",
      "A CBS News analysis of the first three weeks of the president's D.C. deployment showed that violent crime dropped by almost half when compared to the same 19 days in 2024.",
      "Although Mr. Trump's emergency order requiring local D.C. police to assist federal officials has expired, immigration and other federal agents continue to operate in the district. The Metropolitan Police Department has also kept a policy change from August that allows local police officers to share information with the federal immigration officials about individuals who are not in their custody. It also lets police officers transport federal immigration agents and detainees in their custody.",
      "As of Sept. 29, roughly 3,000 personnel from nearly two dozen federal and local agencies were deployed in Washington, including more than 1,300 National Guard troops and 250 agents from DHS, the federal figures show. That includes nearly 200 personnel from Homeland Security Investigations and ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations. More than 130 FBI agents and at least nine prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney's Office in D.C. were deployed as part of the effort.",
      "When the city-wide \"crime emergency\" declared by Mr. Trump ended on Sept. 10, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced to reporters at a news conference that \"immigration enforcement is not what MPD does, and with the end of the emergency, it won't be what MPD does in the future.\"",
      "Asked for clarification on cooperation between D.C. police and immigration authorities on Tuesday, Bowser said, \"I am aware of what's been happening on the ground and ICE is not patrolling with MPD.\"",
      "A surge in Memphis",
      "A similar law enforcement surge is now underway in Memphis, Tennessee, where 650 personnel from 19 federal and state agencies are patrolling the streets. So far, multi-agency teams have made 93 arrests \u2014 including 69 criminal arrests for illegal firearms, drugs and sex offenses, according to U.S. government data analyzed by CBS News. But the task force has also conducted 24 civil immigration arrests.",
      "The deployment includes more than 100 agents dispatched by agencies within DHS, including officials from HSI, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Federal Protective Services.",
      "Earlier this month, while flanked by Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, Mr. Trump signed an order standing up a federal task force to send to Memphis, an effort he described as a \"replica\" of federal law enforcement efforts in D.C. According to a CBS News data team analysis, violent crime in Memphis is down 32% so far this year, compared to the same time period in 2024.",
      "Tennessee law requires local police to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement, including ICE, banning sanctuary policies statewide. Recent legislation mandates state and local police officers notify federal authorities if they encounter someone in the U.S. unlawfully. More than 20 agencies statewide now participate in what's known as ICE's 287(g) program, which is designed to deputize local officers to perform certain immigration enforcement functions and expand the federal government's immigration detention capacity.",
      "In Memphis, local leaders have said their focus is crime control, not acting as immigration agents, but state law leaves little room for discretion. Earlier this month, Mayor Paul Young acknowledged community concerns about the increased federal law enforcement, but vowed to use federal resources \"effectively and for the benefit of the residents of our great city.\"",
      "Lee Harris, the mayor of Shelby County, which includes Memphis, told CBS News he plans to declare an emergency to cover rising jail costs. The Trump administration's new mandate in Memphis has sparked concern from civil rights groups like the ACLU, who warn the crackdown risks sweeping up immigrants from traffic stops and other routine interactions with police, heightening fear for thousands of residents.",
      "What comes next",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry has asked for as many as 1,000 National Guardsmen to deploy to his state. In a letter to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Monday, the Republican leader requested troops to help \"supplement law enforcement presence in high-crime areas, provide logistical and communication support and secure critical infrastructure.\"",
      "Landry noted that cities like New Orleans, Baton Rouge and Shreveport have higher crime rates, a challenge compounded by a lack of law enforcement personnel.",
      "During a gathering of military leaders earlier this week, Mr. Trump suggested additional cities that he deemed \"unsafe,\" including Chicago, could see similar deployments of National Guard and military units.",
      "In the Chicago area, immigration officials have carried out over 900 arrests as part of an effort, dubbed Operation Midway Blitz, that started in early September, though the National Guard has not been involved so far. In Portland, federal officials have been dispatched to fortify an ICE facility after weeks of confrontations and protests outside the site. The president has also vowed to dispatch National Guard troops to Portland.",
      "\"We should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military,\" Mr. Trump told military leaders Tuesday.",

    "story": [
      "Garret Martin\u00a0is a Hurst senior professorial lecturer and the co-director of the Transatlantic Policy Center at the\u00a0American University School of International Service.",
      "When it comes to shutdowns, the U.S. is very much an exception rather than the rule.",
      "On Oct. 1, 2025, hundreds of thousands of federal employees were furloughed as the business of government ground to a halt. With negotiations in Congress seemingly deadlocked over a funding deal, many political watchers are predicting a lengthy period of government closure.",
      "According to the nonpartisan nonprofit Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the latest shutdown represents the 20th such funding gap since 1976.",
      "But it doesn't have to be like this \u2014 and in most countries, it isn't. Other Western democracies experience polarization and political turmoil, too, yet do not experience this problem. Take for example the U.K., traditionally one of Washington's closest allies and home to the \"mother of parliaments.\"",
      "In the British system, government shutdowns just don't happen \u2014 in fact, there has never been one and likely never will be.",
      "So why do they occur in Washington but not London? Essentially, it comes down to four factors: the relative power of the legislature; how easy it is to pass a budget; the political stakes at play; and distinctive appropriation rules.",
      "1. Legislative power",
      "There are significant differences in how the legislatures of the U.K. and U.S. shape the budgetary process.",
      "In the U.K., only the executive branch \u2014 the party or coalition in power \u2014 has the authority to propose spending plans. Parliament, which consists of members from all political parties, maintains an oversight and approval role, but it has very limited power over the budgetary timeline or to amend spending plans. This is a stark contrast with the U.S., where Congress \u2014 which may be split or controlled by a party different to the executive \u2014 plays a far more consequential role.",
      "The U.S. president starts the budget process by laying out the administration's funding priorities. Yet, the Constitution grants Congress the power of the purse \u2014 that is, the power to tax and spend.",
      "Moreover, past legislation has bolstered congressional control. The 1974 Congressional Budget Act helped curtail presidential involvement in the budgeting process, giving Congress more authority over the timeline. That gave Congress more power but also offered it more opportunities to bicker and derail the budgetary process.",
      "2. Thresholds to pass a budget",
      "Congress and the U.K. Parliament also differ when it comes to their voting rules. Passing the U.S. budget is inherently more complicated, as it requires the support of both the Senate and the House of Representatives.",
      "In Parliament, however, the two houses \u2014 the elected House of Commons and unelected House of Lords \u2014 are not equally involved. The two Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949 limited the power of the House of Lords, preventing it from amending or blocking laws relating to budgeting.",
      "Additionally, approving the budget in Westminster requires only an absolute majority of votes in the House of Commons. That tends to be quite a straightforward hurdle to overcome in the U.K. The party in power will typically also command a majority of votes in the chamber or be able to muster one up with the support of smaller parties. It is not, however, so easy in Congress. While a simple majority suffices in the House of Representatives, the Senate still has a 60-vote requirement to close debates before proceeding with a majority vote to pass a bill.",
      "3. Political stakes",
      "U.S. and U.K. politicians do not face the same high stakes over budget approval. Members of Congress may eventually pay a political price for how they vote on the budget, but there is no immediate threat to their jobs. That is not so in the U.K.",
      "Indeed, the party or coalition in power in the U.K. must maintain the \"confidence\" of the House of Commons to stay in office. In other words, they need to command the support of the majority for key votes. U.K. governments can actually fall \u2014 be forced to resign or call for new elections \u2014 if they lose formal votes of confidence. Since confidence is also implied in other major votes, such as over the annual budget proposals, this raises the stakes for members of Parliament. They have tended to think twice before voting against a budget, for fear of triggering a dissolution of Parliament and new elections.",
      "4. Distinctive appropriation rules",
      "Finally, rules about appropriation also set the U.S. apart. For many decades, federal agencies could still operate despite funding bills not being passed. That, however, changed with a ruling by then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti in 1980. He determined that it would be illegal for governments to spend money without congressional approval.",
      "That decision has had the effect of making shutdowns more severe. But it is not a problem that the U.K. experiences because of its distinct rules on appropriation. So-called \"votes on account\" allow the U.K. government \"to obtain an advance on the money they need for the next financial year.\"",

      "But looming over the high court's newest term are legal battles involving President Trump's policies and efforts to reshape the executive branch \u2014 two will be decided by the Supreme Court in the coming months, though others could be poised for its intervention.",
      "The justices are returning to the bench following a summer recess marked by emergency appeals from the Trump administration on his immigration policies, efforts to cancel research grants, and mass layoffs of federal workers, among others. Mr. Trump has prevailed in most of his bids for emergency relief so far, but whether he will see similar success if the Supreme Court evaluates the merits of his plans remains to be seen.",
      "\"Most Americans aren't following the technicalities on the emergency docket, and so they just think the court is siding with the Trump administration every time,\" Allison Orr Larsen, a law professor at William & Mary, told CBS News. \"Once the cases are back up before the justices and decided on the merits, that's going to do a lot to either cement that assumption or upset that assumption.\"",
      "The president will see the first test of one of his policies Nov. 5, when the Supreme Court considers the legality of his sweeping reciprocal tariffs, which are a centerpiece of his economic agenda. The high court is also set to decide whether Mr. Trump can fire without cause a Democratic-appointed member of the Federal Trade Commission. A decision in favor of the president in that case could invalidate removal protections enacted by Congress for a slew of independent agencies it sought to insulate from political pressure.",
      "The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has also been asked to decide the constitutionality of Mr. Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship, though it'll be weeks before the high court decides whether to take up the issue.",
      "Roman Martinez, a lawyer at Latham & Watkins who frequently argues before the court, predicted that come next summer, \"the theme is going to be that the court had to confront an energetic executive, very expansive assertions of authority across this whole range of issues.\"",
      "The cases already set to be decided, coupled with those that are likely to be teed up for Supreme Court review, suggest that the term will be marked by disputes involving social issues and challenges to Mr. Trump's executive actions.",
      "\"The docket is already full of blockbuster cases, and that list is going to grow as challenges to the president's executive orders find their way back to the justices after having been dealt with on the emergency docket,\" Larsen said.",
      "Here are the major cases the Supreme Court will hear this term:",
      "\"Conversion therapy\" ban",
      "The Supreme Court will hear arguments Oct. 7 in a challenge to a Colorado law that bans \"conversion therapy\" for minors. Nearly half the states have similar laws in place.",
      "The law, which took effect in September 2019, prohibits \"conversion therapy\" for people under the age of 18. The state defines \"conversion therapy\" as any practice or treatment, including talk therapy, that attempts to change an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity, including efforts to \"change behaviors or gender expressions or to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attraction or feelings toward individuals of the same sex.\" Violators face fines of up to $5,000 per violation and may be suspended from practicing or stripped of their license.",
      "The case was brought by Kaley Chiles, a licensed counselor in Colorado who performs faith-informed counseling when her clients seek it. Chiles, who is Christian, seeks to engage in talk therapy with young patients who want to \"reduce or eliminate unwanted sexual attractions, change sexual behaviors, or grow in the experience of harmony with [their] physical body,\" according to court filings. But she fears that doing so will leave her in violation of Colorado's law and put her at risk of losing her license.",
      "Chiles sued the state and licensing officials in 2022, arguing that the ban violates her First Amendment rights by censoring her speech based on viewpoint and the content of her conversations. She sought to block Colorado from enforcing it against her.",
      "Colorado officials, meanwhile, argued that its law regulates professional health care treatment to ensure patients receive quality care. States have for centuries regulated professional health care to protect patients from substandard treatment, they said, and the First Amendment has never forbidden states from doing that.",
      "A federal district court ruled for Colorado, finding that its prohibition regulates professional conduct by forbidding certain speech made in a professional context. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit upheld that decision.

      "The use of race in redistricting",
      "On Oct. 15, the Supreme Court will consider for the second time the Louisiana congressional map drawn after the 2020 Census.",
      "But the stakes for the case this time around are much higher: The justices are weighing whether the Constitution allows a state to intentionally create a second majority-minority congressional district to comply with the Voting Rights Act.",
      "\"The outcome of the case will not only determine the next steps for Louisiana's congressional map but may also shape the future of redistricting cases nationwide and forecast the resiliency of our nation's democratic values,\" Sophia Lin Lakin, director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project, told reporters during a call.",
      "The long-running dispute involves the interplay between Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the 14th Amendment's guarantee of equal protection under the law. In this case, state lawmakers drew a second majority-Black congressional district to address a Section 2 violation, but bumped up against the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, which prohibits racial gerrymandering.",
      "The case dates back to the first congressional map drawn by Louisiana Republicans and enacted in 2022, which consisted of one majority-Black district and five majority-White districts. African Americans make up nearly one-third of Louisiana's population.",
      "A district judge ruled that map likely violated Section 2 because it deprived minority voters of the chance to elect their preferred candidate. So Louisiana state lawmakers went back to the drawing board and crafted a new map that contained a second majority-minority district.",
      "Republicans said the re-drawn districts brought the map into compliance with the Voting Rights Act and protected key GOP incumbents in the U.S. House, namely House Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Julia Letlow, who sits on the powerful Appropriations Committee.",
      "But a group of 12 self-described \"non-African-Americans\" challenged that new map as a racial gerrymander in violation of the 14th Amendment, and a three-judge panel of district judges agreed. It found that race predominated in drawing the new voting boundaries.",
      "Last March, the Supreme Court heard arguments on whether to keep Louisiana's re-crafted map in place. But in June, it ordered further arguments this term and later asked the parties \u2014 Louisiana officials, the 12 non-African-American voters, and a separate group of Black Louisianans \u2014 to address whether Louisiana's intentional creation of the second majority-minority House district violates the 14th or 15th Amendments.",
      "While Louisiana officials first defended the re-shaped House district lines, they now say the creation of the second majority-Black district in its new voting map violates the Constitution.",
      "The Supreme Court has typically given map-drawers breathing room to navigate the requirements of Section 2 and the 14th Amendment, but the Louisiana case could lead to a weakening of Section 2.",
      "In a 2023 decision that upheld the constitutionality of Section 2 as applied to redistricting, Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested that there should be an end to the drawing of voting boundaries based on race at some point. In a concurring opinion, he wrote \"the authority to conduct race-based redistricting cannot extend indefinitely into the future.\"",
      "Trump's sweeping tariffs",
      "Mr. Trump announced earlier this year that he would be imposing sweeping baseline tariffs on imports from nearly every U.S. trading partner, to address \"chronic trade deficits\" that he said \"are no longer merely an economic \u2014 they're a national emergency.\" He also imposed levies on products from Canada, Mexico and China because of what he said was their failure to stop illicit drugs from flowing into the U.S.",
      "The president used a law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to implement the tariffs. That law gives the president the authority to declare a national emergency to deal with \"any unusual and extraordinary threat\" to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States. Once the president declares a national emergency, IEEPA gives the president the authority to take certain actions, including to regulate importation.",
      "Mr. Trump declared national emergencies related to trade deficits and drug trafficking, and imposed the tariffs under IEEPA to address them.",
      "A group of 12 states and small businesses filed lawsuits challenging Mr. Trump's tariffs, arguing that IEEPA did not give the president the authority to impose his global levies. A federal appeals court sided with the plaintiffs, finding that Mr. Trump's tariffs are illegal. A federal district court in Washington, D.C., also reached the same conclusion.",
      "The Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court, and it agreed to hear the cases on an expedited basis.",
      "The high court has in the past been skeptical of broad presidential authority when it involves what are known in administrative law as \"major questions\" of vast economic and political significance, like when it invalidated former President Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness plan. But the Trump administration has argued that this delegation of power involves foreign affairs and national security, and his determination that tariffs are best suited to address trade-deficit and drug-trafficking emergencies warrant deference.",
      "Martinez predicted the debate in the case will be about textualism and how to look at the language in IEEPA, as well as principles like the major questions doctrine, deference and nondelegation that have been embraced by the Supreme Court's conservative majority.",
      "\"These are all the same kinds of arguments that the conservative side of the court has been pushing very strongly in recent years to limit the use and some would say abuse of executive branch authority,\" Martinez, who clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts, said during an event hosted by Georgetown Law. \"It will be interesting to see how those same principles are applied in this context, where you have a Republican president with a major policy initiative.\"",
      "Campaign finance",
      "The Supreme Court has in a string of recent decisions unraveled campaign finance limits as violations of the First Amendment, which has allowed more money to flow into politics. The latest campaign finance dispute before the justices could follow that trend.",
      "At issue in the case is a 50-year-old provision of campaign finance law that restricts the amount of money political parties can spend in coordination with their candidates during a campaign. For 2024, the limits on coordinated spending by party committees were from $123,600 to $3.7 million for Senate candidates, and between $61,800 and $123,600 for House candidates.",
      "In 2022, two GOP campaign committees, along with then-Senate candidate JD Vance and then-Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio argued these limits were unconstitutional.",
      "A federal appeals court upheld the limits under a 2001 Supreme Court decision that rejected a challenge to an earlier version of the restrictions. But since that ruling 24 years ago, the makeup of the high court has changed significantly and now has a 6-3 conservative majority.",
      "Republicans appealed the lower court decision to the Supreme Court and urged it to strike down the limits on coordinated spending as a violation of the First Amendment.",
      "State laws targeting transgender athletes",
      "On the heels of its June decision upholding a Tennessee law banning certain medical treatments for minors experiencing gender dysphoria, the Supreme Court said it would decide whether states can prohibit transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports.",
      "The justices will be looking at laws from Idaho and West Virginia to determine whether they violate the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection and, in the case involving West Virginia, Title IX. Idaho was the first state to ban transgender athletes from competing in girls' and women's sports, and roughly two dozen have enacted similar laws.",
      "Mr. Trump also signed an executive order in February that aimed to keep transgender girls and women from competing on teams that match their gender identity.",
      "The Idaho case was brought by Lindsay Hecox, a transgender woman who attended Boise State University and wanted to try out for the women's track and cross-country teams as a sophomore. She has been treated for gender dysphoria for several years, including receiving testosterone suppression and estrogen.",
      "A U.S. district court blocked enforcement of Idaho's law, finding the ban discriminates against transgender women. A federal appeals court upheld the injunction as applied to Hecox.",
      "Months after the Supreme Court agreed to take up the case, Hecox decided to dismiss her lawsuit for personal reasons and because of \"negative public scrutiny from certain quarters.\" Her lawyers have asked the Supreme Court to toss out the appeals court's decision and order the case to be dismissed.",
      "The West Virginia case involves Becky Pepper-Jackson, who receives puberty-delaying treatment and estrogen hormone therapy and wanted to participate in girls' athletics in middle school. A federal judge initially blocked the state from enforcing the ban only against Pepper-Jackson, ruling it likely violates Title IX and the Constitution.",
      "But in 2023, the judge sided with the state and upheld the law, finding that the state can legislate sports rules because sex and the physical characteristics that flow from it are related to athletic performance and fairness in sports.",
      "A federal appeals court ruled in 2024, though, that the West Virginia law violated Title IX by discriminating against Pepper-Jackson on the basis of sex.",
      "Trump's power to fire executive officers",
      "Since returning to the White House, Mr. Trump has sought to overhaul the executive branch, including by firing Democratic-appointed officials at independent agencies without cause. He has removed those officers despite federal laws shielding them from being terminated unless for inefficiency, malfeasance in office or neglect of duty.",
      "Lower courts have repeatedly sided with the fired officials and ordered them to be reinstated. But the Supreme Court has allowed Mr. Trump to fire members of the Merit Systems Protection Board, National Labor Relations Board and Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "After allowing those other firings, the Supreme Court agreed to decide whether for-cause removal protections violate the separation of powers. It will also decide whether Mr. Trump can remove Lisa Cook from her position on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.",
      "\"These are cases that raise really profound questions about presidential power \u2026 about Congress' ability to design institutions of government and to insulate certain important functions from the political whims of the day, whether it be setting interest rates or deciding labor relations or nuclear safety,\" lawyer Deepak Gupta told reporters at the Georgetown Law event. Gupta represents Gwynne Wilcox, who was fired from her position as a member of the National Labor Relations Board.",
      "One of the disputes before the high court, which has not yet been scheduled for argument, involves Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, who Mr. Trump removed from her post at the Federal Trade Commission. A district court ruled the president violated a 1914 law that limits the grounds for removing a FTC commissioner to instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "When the case landed before the Supreme Court in an emergency posture, it allowed Mr. Trump to oust Slaughter, and the high court said it would decide the constitutionality of removal protections for the FTC.",
      "The case puts in the Supreme Court's crosshairs a 1935 decision that allowed Congress to enact removal restrictions for officials at certain independent agencies, which the high court has chipped away at in recent years.",
      "The second case, involving Cook, will be argued in January. Mr. Trump attempted to fire Cook from the Fed board after an administration official accused her of mortgage fraud. The effort to remove her is unprecedented, as no president has attempted to fire a sitting Fed governor in the central bank's 112-year-history.",
      "Cook has denied any wrongdoing, and she has not been charged with any criminal offense. A federal judge ruled in September that Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Cook likely violated federal law because he did not state a legally permissible cause for her termination.",
      "The judge also said Cook's due process rights were likely violated because she did not receive notice and an opportunity to be heard before she was ousted.",
      "A federal appeals court rejected a request from the Trump administration to allow the president to fire Cook and agreed with the lower court that Cook did not receive adequate process before her attempted removal. The two-judge majority did not address whether Mr. Trump satisfied the \"for cause\" removal requirement.",
      "In an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, Mr. Trump asked the justices to let him remove Cook from the Fed Board while the challenge to her firing moved forward. But the high court declined to immediately rule on his request for relief, and instead said it will hear arguments in January.",
      "By putting off a decision, the Supreme Court let Cook remain a Fed governor while it considers the issue.",
      "Gun rights",
      "Just before the start of the new term, the Supreme Court said it will decide whether Hawaii can stop people with concealed-carry permits from bringing their handguns onto private property that is open to the public, unless they receive \"express authorization\" from the property owner.",
      "The case involves firearms restrictions enacted in Hawaii in 2023, on the heels of the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling that expanded gun rights. The measure prohibits people with concealed-carry permits from carrying handguns on different types of property, including beaches, playgrounds, bars and restaurants that serve liquor, and other \"sensitive\" locations.",
      "The restriction at issue in the case before the Supreme Court bars people with concealed-carry licenses from bringing handguns onto private property unless they receive permission from the property owner. Four other states \u2014 California, Maryland, New Jersey, and New York \u2014 have similar laws that require a property owner's approval before carrying firearms on private property, such as by posting signs stating that guns are allowed.",
      "The Hawaii Firearms Coalition and three gun owners with concealed-carry permits challenged the law in June 2023, and a federal appeals court ultimately upheld the provision related to private property.",
      "Lawyers for the gun owners argued that the 9th Circuit effectively found that the Second Amendment does not apply to private property open to the public, rendering \"illusory the right to carry in public.\" The Trump administration had\u00a0urged the Supreme Court\u00a0to take up the dispute, warning that because few property owners post signs allowing or prohibiting guns, Hawaii's restriction functioned as a \"near-complete ban on public carry.\"",
      "Hawaii officials, meanwhile, said the rule regarding private property \"represents a permissible effort to vindicate the rights of Hawaii's citizens.\" They argued that under its law, a person who wants to bring a gun into a store can simply ask for oral permission.",
      "Since its June 2022 decision recognizing the Second Amendment's right to bear arms extends to outside the home, the Supreme Court has been asked to decide the constitutionality of a number of longstanding firearms restrictions and state laws. Last year, the high court upheld a federal law prohibiting people subject to a domestic violence restraining order from having firearms.",
      "But it has also declined to take up challenges to state bans on assault weapons and other federal measures.",

      "Brian Finucane, a former attorney-adviser at the State Department who advised the U.S. government on counterterrorism and the use of military force, said the explanation given to Congress is not enough to justify the administration's actions.",
      "\"This justification put out here that the U.S. is somehow in an armed conflict does not do the trick because it's not supported by the facts,\" Finucune said in an interview. \"There has been no armed attack on the United States.\"",
      "Some members of Congress have also questioned the legal justification for the three boat strikes. The administration has said little about who was in each boat or what drugs were on board. Mr. Trump has alleged the first two boats \u2014 including the one hit on Sept. 15 \u2014 hailed from Venezuela, but didn't specify a country of origin for the third strike.",
      "The initial strike on Sept. 2, killed 11 people, according to a post on President Trump's Truth Social, which didn't include details about what drugs were on board.",
      "When asked what legal authority the Pentagon used to justify the strike, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told reporters traveling with him to Fort Benning, Georgia, \"We have the absolute and complete authority to conduct that,\" without citing any specific legal justification.",
      "\"If foreign terrorist organizations are poisoning people with drugs from drug cartels, it is no different from Al Qaeda, and they'll be treated as such.\" Hegseth said.",
      "Since then, the U.S. military has struck two more alleged drug boats, one on Sept. 15, killing three people, and another on Sept. 19, killing another three, and has threatened further strikes.",
      "After the initial strike, Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky had an online dispute with Vice President J.D. Vance about the actions \u2014 and the lack of information from the administration.",
      "\"I'm just disappointed that, you know, the leaders of a country like ours that is famous for having due process for trying to make sure that the innocent aren't harmed in any way would glorify the idea of killing people without any sort of evidence presented as to who they are,\" he told reporters on Capitol Hill.",
      "The strikes come amid growing tensions between the Trump administration and the government of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, whom the U.S. has accused of collaborating with gangs \u2014 a charge Maduro's regime denies.",
      "Maduro said earlier this week he is considering declaring a state of emergency in response to U.S. \"aggression,\" following the boat strikes and a deployment of several U.S. Navy vessels off the waters of Venezuela.",
      "Separately in March, the White House invoked the 1798 wartime Alien Enemies Act against Tren de Aragua, accusing its members of engaging in \"irregular warfare\" against the U.S. \"both directly and at the direction, clandestine or otherwise, of the Maduro regime in Venezuela.\" The administration has controversially tried to use the law as a rationale to rapidly deport accused Tren de Aragua members, in some cases sending them to a Salvadoran prison.",

      "When asking them to compare longer-term job market trends they're seeing, the picture is mixed, and the jobs market is not seen as growing. By 4 to 1, Americans think there are fewer \u2014 not more \u2014 good jobs where they live than there were five years ago, and the rest see it holding steady. Even workers who feel they have some job security tend to think there are fewer, not more, good jobs out there.",

      "As an ongoing string of discussions and reports speak to the potential impact of AI across a number of fields and the workplace, Americans overall hold a skeptical outlook, on balance. They feel AI will have a net-negative effect on job availability in their fields over the next ten years. This is the case for those currently working as well as those not.",
      "Given that, more broadly, many believe the development of AI and AI companies will have a negative impact on the U.S. economy overall. This view spans both education and income levels, though it is a little less pronounced among younger Americans.",

    "published": "Mon, 29 Sep 2025 05:00:16 -0400",
    "summary": "Under a new law, many Americans will have to meet a work requirement to obtain and keep their Medicaid coverage. But due to an exemption, millions living in areas of high unemployment could be spared.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of Medicaid enrollees may have a way out of the new federal work requirement \u2014 if they live in a county with high unemployment.",
      "By January 2027, President Trump's far-reaching domestic policy law will require many adult, nondisabled Medicaid enrollees in 42 states and Washington, D.C., to work or volunteer 80 hours a month or go to school.",
      "But under the law, Medicaid enrollees in counties where unemployment is at least 8% or 1.5 times the national unemployment rate could be shielded from the work requirement, if their state applies for an exemption.",
      "A new analysis by KFF shows that exemption in the GOP's work requirement could offer a reprieve to potentially millions of Americans caught in a tough spot \u2014 needing to work to secure health insurance but having trouble finding a job.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office projected the work requirement would apply to 18.5 million Medicaid enrollees, causing about 5.3 million to lose their government health coverage by 2034. CBO spokesperson Caitlin Emma confirmed to KFF Health News that analysts factored the unemployment rate exemption into their projections. Only states that expanded Medicaid under the 2010 Affordable Care Act or a special waiver must enact a work requirement, under the federal law.",
      "But how many people could be exempt depends on how the Trump administration interprets the law, in addition to whether their states' officials apply.",
      "For example, if Trump officials exempt people in counties where the unemployment rate has been above the law's thresholds for any month over a 12-month period, about 4.6 million Medicaid enrollees in 386 counties could qualify for an exemption today based on the latest unemployment data, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "That amounts to just under a quarter of all Medicaid enrollees subject to the work requirement.",
      "Under that one-month threshold, \"the impact could be fairly significant,\" said Jennifer Tolbert, a co-author of the analysis and the deputy director of KFF's Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured.",
      "But, she said, the Trump administration is more likely to adopt a stricter threshold based on average unemployment over a 12-month period. That would align with work requirements under the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the food assistance commonly known as food stamps.",
      "Only about 1.4 million Medicaid enrollees living in 158 counties could be exempted under that standard, or about 7% of the total subject to work requirements, KFF found. That's about 7% of enrollees who live in expansion states who would otherwise need to meet the new requirement.",
      "Based on the 12-month criteria, about 90% of Medicaid enrollees who could be exempted based on high unemployment reside in five states, according to KFF: California, New York, Michigan, Kentucky, and Ohio. California alone accounts for over half of those who could be exempted.",
      "The unemployment rate exemption is one of several carve-outs from the Medicaid work requirement in the GOP's law. The law also exempts parents with children under 14, people who are disabled or frail, and those who are pregnant, incarcerated, or in a substance use disorder program, among others. The high unemployment provision is different than most because it exempts people living in entire counties.",
      "Two top Republicans key to the bill's passage \u2014 House Speaker Mike Johnson and Sen. Mike Crapo, chair of the Senate Finance Committee \u2014 did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "To qualify for the Medicaid exemption, states would have to apply to the federal government on behalf of individuals in eligible counties. And if a county earned an exemption, the government would determine how long it applies.",
      "Even if the federal government grants exemptions broadly, health advocates fear some Republican-led states could balk at applying for exemptions in order to keep enrollment down, as they say has been the case with SNAP exemptions. As of 2023, 18 states did not have an exemption under the SNAP program, even though some of their residents might be eligible.",
      "\"It's not a guarantee that people can rely on,\" said Emily Beauregard, executive director of Kentucky Voices for Health, an advocacy group that intends to push for the broadest possible exemptions to help people maintain their coverage. Eastern Kentucky has several counties with perennially high unemployment.",
      "In advocating for Mr. Trump's bill, many Republicans in Washington argued that most people who gained Medicaid benefits under the Affordable Care Act should be working to get off of government assistance.",
      "But as Georgia's and Arkansas' experiences have shown, Medicaid work requirements can be costly for states to run and frustrating for enrollees to navigate. About 18,000 people in Arkansas, or nearly a quarter of the state's adults who gained Medicaid coverage through the ACA expansion, lost coverage when the state had a work requirement in 2018 and 2019. A court ended the state's work requirement program.",
      "Critics point out that most Medicaid enrollees already work or have a disability or caregiving responsibilities, and they argue the reporting requirements merely serve as a bureaucratic hurdle to obtaining and keeping coverage. Under the GOP law, enrollees' work status needs to be verified at least twice a year.",
      "Most of the coverage losses due to work requirements occur among people who work or should qualify for an exemption but nevertheless lose coverage due to red tape, research shows.",
      "Not every state must implement a work requirement under Mr. Trump's law, only those that chose to expand Medicaid coverage to more low-income people through the ACA or a federal waiver. The ACA has provided hundreds of billions in federal dollars to help states cover everyone making up to 138% of the federal poverty level \u2014 $21,597 for an individual in 2025.",
      "Forty states and Washington, D.C., took up the expansion. Georgia and Wisconsin partly expanded their Medicaid eligibility by getting a federal waiver, adding them to the list of states subject to the work requirement. These two states were not included in the KFF analysis because of a lack of county-level enrollment data.",
      "Jennifer Wagner, director of Medicaid eligibility and enrollment at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said she is pleased the law makes some exceptions for places where jobs are scarce. It could limit how many people lose coverage because of the work requirement, she said.",
      "Wagner said SNAP's unemployment rate exemption has helped millions of people avoid losing their food assistance, but its impact also depends on whether a state seeks the waiver.",
      "She is concerned the Trump administration may make it difficult for counties to get exempted under the Medicaid law.",
      "\"I'm glad it's in there as it will certainly help people, but it's still a terrible bill,\" she said. \"This will not really blunt the harm of the bill.\"",

      "A mysterious \"rogue planet\"\u00a0has been observed gobbling 6 billion tons of gas and dust a second \u2014 an unprecedented rate that blurs the line between planets and stars, astronomers said Thursday.",
      "Unlike Earth and other planets in our solar system, which orbit the sun, rogue planets float freely through the universe untethered to a star.",
      "Scientists estimate there could be trillions of rogue planets in our galaxy alone \u2014 but they are difficult to spot because they mostly drift quietly along in perpetual night.",

      "These strange objects intrigue astronomers because they are \"neither a star nor a proper planet,\" Alexander Scholz, an astronomer at Scotland's University of St. Andrews and co-author of a new study, told AFP.",

      "Rogue planet found growing at record rate: six billion tonnes a second!\n\nUnlike the planets in our Solar System, rogue...",
      "The team of researchers behind the new study was stunned to observe an astonishing growth spurt in a rogue planet around 620 light years from Earth in the constellation Chamaeleon.",
      "The planet, officially called Cha 1107-7626, has a mass five to 10 times bigger than Jupiter.",
      "Scholz explained that the object is \"still in its infancy,\" being roughly 1 or 2 million years old.",
      "The object grows by sucking in matter from a disc that surrounds it \u2014 a process called accretion.",
      "But what the astronomers saw happen to Cha 1107-7626 \"blurs the line between stars and planets,\" study co-author Belinda Damian said in a statement.",
      "In August this year, the planet suddenly started devouring matter from its disc at a record-breaking 6 billion tons per second \u2014 eight times faster than a few months earlier.",
      "\"This is the strongest accretion episode ever recorded for a planetary-mass object,\" said Almendros-Abad.",
      "\"Awe-inspiring\"",
      "By comparing light emitted before and during this binge-eating session, the scientists discovered that magnetic activity was playing a role in driving matter towards the object.",
      "This phenomenon has previously only been observed in stars.",
      "The chemistry in the disc also changed. Water vapour was detected in the disc during the accretion episode, but not beforehand.",
      "This is also something that has previously been observed in stars \u2014 but never for a forming planet.",
      "Lead study author Ray Jayawardhana of Johns Hopkins University said the discovery implies \"that some objects comparable to giant planets form the way stars do, from contracting clouds of gas and dust accompanied by discs of their own, and they go through growth episodes just like newborn stars.\"",
      "No matter how weird, Cha 1107-7626 is still expected to have similar characteristics to huge planets, because it is of similar size.",
      "Scholz said that, unlike stars, this object is \"not massive enough to ever have fusion reactions in the core.\"",
      "So, like other planets, \"it will cool inevitably as it gets older,\" he added.",
      "Amelia Bayo, another co-author of the study in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, said, \"The idea that a planetary object can behave like a star is awe-inspiring.\"",

      "Just 310 miles wide and invisible to the naked eye, the white, scar-covered Enceladus is one of hundreds of moons orbiting the sixth planet from the sun.",
      "For a long time, scientists believed Enceladus was too far away from the sun \u2014 and therefore too cold \u2014 to be habitable.",
      "Then the Cassini space probe flew past the moon several times during a 2004-2017 trip to Saturn and its rings, discovering evidence that a vast saltwater ocean is concealed under the moon's miles-thick layer of ice.",
      "Since then, scientists have been sifting through the data collected by Cassini, revealing that the ocean has many of the elements thought to be needed to host life, including salt, methane, carbon dioxide and phosphorus.",
      "When the spacecraft passed over the moon's south pole, it discovered jets of water bursting through cracks on the surface.",
      "These jets were propelling tiny ice particles \u2014 smaller than grains of sand \u2014 into space. While some of these ice grains fell back to the moon's surface, others collected around one of Saturn's many rings.",
      "When Cassini flew through Saturn's outermost \"E\" ring, it was \"detecting samples from Enceladus all the time,\" Nozair Khawaja, a planetary scientist at the Free University of Berlin and lead author of the new study, said in a statement from the European Space agency.",
      "\"There are many possible pathways from the organic molecules we found in the Cassini data to potentially biologically relevant compounds, which enhances the likelihood that the moon is habitable,\" Nozair said.",
      "By looking through these samples, scientists had previously identified numerous organic molecules \u2014 including the precursors of amino acids, which are fundamental building blocks of life.",
      "But these ice grains could have been altered after being trapped in the ring for hundreds of years \u2014 or beaten up by blasts of cosmic radiation.",
      "So the scientists wanted to look at some fresh ice grains.",
      "Luckily, they already had access to some.",
      "When Cassini flew directly into the spray spewing from the moon's surface in 2008, grains of ice hit the spacecraft's Cosmic Dust Analyzer at around 11 miles a second.",
      "But it took years to complete a detailed chemical analysis of these particles, which was the subject of the study published in the journal Nature Astronomy.",
      "\"Being habitable and being inhabited are two very different things. We believe that Enceladus is habitable, but we do not know if life is indeed present,\" the University of Washington's Fabian Klenner, who took part in the study, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"Having a variety of organic compounds on an extraterrestrial water world is simply phenomenal,\" Klenner told the AP in an email.",
      "\"Another piece of the puzzle\"",
      "Study co-author Frank Postberg said the research proves that \"the complex organic molecules Cassini detected in Saturn's E ring are not just a product of long exposure to space, but are readily available in Enceladus's ocean.\"",
      "French astrochemist Caroline Freissinet, who was not involved in the study, told AFP that there was \"not much doubt\" that these molecules were in the moon's ocean.",
      "But this confirmation provides \"another piece in the puzzle,\" she added.",
      "It also shows that recent technology such as artificial intelligence allows scientists to perform new kinds of analysis on old data, she said.",
      "But to get the best idea about what is happening on Enceladus, a mission would need to land near the icy geysers and collect samples, she added.",
      "The European Space Agency has been studying the potential of a mission that would do just that.",
      "After all, \"Enceladus ticks all the boxes to be a habitable environment that could support life,\" the agency said in the statement.",
      "Khawaja added that \"even not finding life on Enceladus would be a huge discovery, because it raises serious questions about why life is not present in such an environment when the right conditions are there.\"",
      "NASA has a spacecraft en route to another enticing target to hunt for the ingredients of life: Jupiter's moon Europa. The Europa Clipper is expected to begin orbiting Jupiter in 2030 with dozens of Europa flybys.

    "story": [
      "A mysterious \"rogue planet\"\u00a0has been observed gobbling 6 billion tons of gas and dust a second \u2014 an unprecedented rate that blurs the line between planets and stars, astronomers said Thursday.",
      "Unlike Earth and other planets in our solar system, which orbit the sun, rogue planets float freely through the universe untethered to a star.",
      "Scientists estimate there could be trillions of rogue planets in our galaxy alone \u2014 but they are difficult to spot because they mostly drift quietly along in perpetual night.",
      "\"People may think of planets as quiet and stable worlds, but with this discovery we see that planetary-mass objects freely floating in space can be exciting places,\" V\u00edctor Almendros-Abad, a lead author of the new study, said in a\u00a0statement.",
      "These strange objects intrigue astronomers because they are \"neither a star nor a proper planet,\" Alexander Scholz, an astronomer at Scotland's University of St. Andrews and co-author of a new study, told AFP.",
      "\"Their origin remains an open question: are they the lowest-mass objects formed like stars, or giant planets ejected from their birth systems?\"",
      "Rogue planet found growing at record rate: six billion tonnes a second!\n\nUnlike the planets in our Solar System, rogue...",
      "The team of researchers behind the new study was stunned to observe an astonishing growth spurt in a rogue planet around 620 light years from Earth in the constellation Chamaeleon.",
      "The planet, officially called Cha 1107-7626, has a mass five to 10 times bigger than Jupiter.",
      "Scholz explained that the object is \"still in its infancy,\" being roughly 1 or 2 million years old.",
      "The object grows by sucking in matter from a disc that surrounds it \u2014 a process called accretion.",
      "But what the astronomers saw happen to Cha 1107-7626 \"blurs the line between stars and planets,\" study co-author Belinda Damian said in a statement.",
      "In August this year, the planet suddenly started devouring matter from its disc at a record-breaking 6 billion tons per second \u2014 eight times faster than a few months earlier.",
      "\"This is the strongest accretion episode ever recorded for a planetary-mass object,\" said Almendros-Abad.",
      "\"Awe-inspiring\"",
      "By comparing light emitted before and during this binge-eating session, the scientists discovered that magnetic activity was playing a role in driving matter towards the object.",
      "This phenomenon has previously only been observed in stars.",
      "The chemistry in the disc also changed. Water vapour was detected in the disc during the accretion episode, but not beforehand.",
      "This is also something that has previously been observed in stars \u2014 but never for a forming planet.",
      "Lead study author Ray Jayawardhana of Johns Hopkins University said the discovery implies \"that some objects comparable to giant planets form the way stars do, from contracting clouds of gas and dust accompanied by discs of their own, and they go through growth episodes just like newborn stars.\"",
      "No matter how weird, Cha 1107-7626 is still expected to have similar characteristics to huge planets, because it is of similar size.",
      "Scholz said that, unlike stars, this object is \"not massive enough to ever have fusion reactions in the core.\"",
      "So, like other planets, \"it will cool inevitably as it gets older,\" he added.",
      "Amelia Bayo, another co-author of the study in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, said, \"The idea that a planetary object can behave like a star is awe-inspiring.\"",

      "The observations were made by the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Chile.",

    "summary": "Dutch producer pitches her AI creation, Tilly Norwood, as the next Scarlett Johansson, and says several agents are vying to represent it.",
    "story": [
      "Like thousands of actors, Tilly Norwood is looking for a Hollywood agent. Her greatest role? Pretending to be human.",
      "That's because Tilly Norwood is a 100% AI-generated product, created by Dutch producer and comedian Eline Van der Velden, founder of a company named Xicoia, which bills itself as the world's first artificial intelligence talent studio. Velden pitches her AI creation as the next Scarlett Johansson, and says there are several agents vying to represent it, CBS News' Jo Ling Kent reported recently.",
      "Since Velden launched the digital character's prospective career, Tilly Norwood has been all the talk in Hollywood.",
      "But not in a good way. Guilds, actors and filmmakers have met the Xicoia product with an immediate wave of backlash, protesting that artificial intelligence should not have a starring role in the acting profession. In a statement Tuesday, the Screen Actors Guild said that \"creativity is, and should remain, human-centered.\"",
      "\"To be clear, 'Tilly Norwood' is not an actor, it's a character generated by a computer program that was trained on the work of countless professional performers \u2014 without permission or compensation,\" the guild said. \"It has no life experience to draw from, no emotion and, from what we've seen, audiences aren't interested in watching computer-generated content untethered from the human experience.\"",
      "Actor Sean Astin, who starred in \"Lord of the Rings\" and \"The Goonies,\" and was recently elected president of SAG-AFTRA, also emphasized how AI actors are artificial constructs trained off of work by real performers.",
      "\"You're made up of stuff that doesn't belong to you,\" he told CBS News. \"Let's just make sure that credit is given where credit is due.\"",
      "Van der Velden, who is also the founder of the AI production studio Particle6, promoted Tilly Norwood last month at the Zurich Summit, the industry sidebar of the Zurich Film Festival. It was there that she said talent agencies were circling Norwood and that she expected to soon announce a signing.",
      "Many in Hollywood hope that never happens.",
      "\"Any talent agency that engages in this should be boycotted by all guilds,\" wrote Natasha Lyonne on Instagram. The \"Russian Doll\" star is directing a feature titled \"Uncanny Valley\" that pledges to use \"ethical\" artificial intelligence in combination with traditional filmmaking techniques. \"Deeply misguided & totally disturbed,\" she added. \"Not the way. Not the vibe. Not the use.\"",
      "Artificial intelligence is often used as a tool in film production, though its implementation is hotly debated. It was a major bargaining point in the lengthy strike by SAG-AFTRA that concluded in late 2023 with some safeguards put in place to protect the use of actors' likenesses and performances by AI. A yearlong strike by video game actors hinged on AI protections. In July, video game actors approved a new contract that mandates employers obtain written permission to create a digital replica.",
      "But there have been numerous controversies over the use of AI in acting. The Oscar-winning 2024 film \"The Brutalist\" used artificial intelligence for Hungarian dialogue spoken by Adrien Brody and Felicity Jones' characters, the revelation of which prompted debate in the industry.",
      "Van der Velden responded to the stir around Tilly Norwood on Instagram.",
      "\"To those who have expressed anger over the creation of my AI character, Tilly Norwood, she is not a replacement for a human being, but a creative work \u2014 a piece of art,\" Van der Velden said on Sunday. \"Like many forms of art before her, she sparks conversation, and that in itself shows the power of creativity.\"",
      "Van der Velden didn't respond to interview requests Tuesday. In her post, she argued that AI characters should be judged as their own genre.",
      "\"Creating Tilly has been, for me, an act of imagination and craftsmanship, not unlike drawing a character, writing a role or shaping a performance,\" she added. \"It takes time, skill and iteration to bring such a character to life.\"",
      "That statement was also shared on Tilly Norwood's own Instagram account. Posts include photos of the creation drinking coffee, shopping for clothes and preparing for various projects. As of Tuesday, the account had more than 33,000 followers.",
      "A post shared by Tilly Norwood (@tillynorwood)",
      "\"Had such a blast filming some screen tests recently,\" one post reads. \"Every day feels like a step closer to the big screen.\"",
      "Asked what human actors bring to a performance that AI can't, Astin said \"authenticity,\" adding, \"You can fall in love. Your parents can die. You can you can be in some terrifying situation. The sum of all of our emotional experiences in our life, artificial intelligence can approximate it \u2014 it is not real.\"",

    "summary": "\"I am very happy doing what I am doing,\" says one young electrician who pursued a skilled trade as AI disrupts the job market for college grads.",
    "story": [
      "At just 23, Jacob Palmer is already running his own electrical company. He launched the business in 2024 after starting in the field as an apprentice electrician, a career path he embarked on when college turned out not to be for him.",
      "Palmer has no regrets about his decision to forego college and instead establish himself as a tradesman. \"I am very happy doing what I am doing now because it has given me the opportunity to work for myself and be independent,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Experts say the skilled trades \u2014 jobs like electricians, plumbers, welders, masons, HVAC technicians and other occupations requiring extensive training and often licensing \u2014 are attracting a growing number of young people put off by high tuition costs.",
      "More than 57% of Gen Zers surveyed by Jobber, a software tool for service businesses, cite student loan debt as a concern about going to college, according to the company's annual report on attitudes toward blue-collar jobs.",
      "More recently, signs that\u00a0artificial intelligence is starting to gobble up the kind of entry-level jobs that once went to young college graduates are also leading young workers to consider the trades. Some 77% of Gen Zers say it's important that their future job is hard to automate, with many pointing to professions like carpenter, plumber, and electrician as occupations they believe are safe from automation. By contrast, they see less security in fields like software development, data analytics, and accounting, according to the survey.",
      "\"That route is losing some of the stigma,\" said David Asay, president of Advantage Reline, a trenchless pipe rehabilitation company in Mesa, Arizona. \"The perception among that younger group is no longer, 'Oh, you're working construction, you didn't go to school?' It's, 'What a cool skillset. You're making a good career path.'\"",
      "Harder path for college grads",
      "For decades, many young people shunned the trades, with everyone from economists and career experts to politicians and parents emphasizing the importance of obtaining a college diploma. That conventional wisdom isn't entirely wrong \u2014 it's just behind the times.",
      "\"The attitude was that jobs in the trades were less than desirable,\" said Angie Hicks, co-founder of Angi, an online home improvement services guide told CBS News.",
      "But several factors are contributing to a shift in how people are thinking about such occupations. For one, going to college for many Americans often requires going into debt. The average cost of college, including tuition and room and board, now tops\u00a0$38,000 a year and is approaching $60,000 for private institutions, according to the Education Data Initiative.",
      "Factoring in the added burden of interest on student loans and potential income one foregoes while in school, the total cost of earning a bachelor's degree can exceed $500,000, the research firm has found.",
      "More recently, economists also point to a jump in unemployment for recent college grads, which some experts say is an early warning sign that AI is taking jobs away from less experienced workers. The jobless rate for 23-to-27-year-old college grads this year now hovers around 4.6%, up from 3.2% for the same demographic in 2019.",
      "Strikingly, non-college-educated workers in the same age range have experienced a much smaller uptick in unemployment, at roughly 0.5%, over the same period, according to an analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "\"AI can't go out in the field\"",
      "Vinnie Curcie, founder and CEO of OC Solar, a solar installation company in Irvine, California, said the solar energy field differs from other trades in that the work requires time both in the office and in the field. OC Solar offers three main services \u2014 solar panel and battery sales, project management and installation services. But he expects AI will soon handle much of the sales and project management sides of the business.",
      "While prospective employees once tended to have stronger interest in the company's marketing, management or other white-collar roles, more job candidates today are eager for roles in the field.",
      "\"More people are interested in the field because they know that's where the job security is,\" Curcie told CBS News.",
      "Some school districts also report seeing growing student interest in blue-collar careers. Marlo Loria, director of career and technical education and innovative partnerships at Mesa Public Schools in Mesa, Arizona, said more of her students are enrolling in schools' welding, construction and auto shop programs than there is space for.",
      "Asay, of Advantage Reline, added that students with an entrepreneurial bent can also be well-suited for the skilled trades.",
      "\"They can take their skills and create their own business, or become a bigger part of our business, outside of being someone with a shovel in a trench,\" he said.",
      "Palmer said his business generated $90,000 in revenue in its first year and is on track to top $150,000 in 2025, a more than 30% increase \u2014 no college degree needed. The other upside to life as an electrician, as he sees it, is the job security.",
      "\"I don't feel overly threatened by the growth of AI in my industry. That will be a pretty impressive robot that can do my job one day, if it ever happens,\" Palmer said.",
      "Kayden Evans, an 18-year-old senior at Mountain View High School in Mesa, Arizona, has his eyes set on a career working with his hands, and to eventually start his own business. Currently an intern at Empire Cat, a company that sells, rents and services heavy equipment and tractors, he plans on going straight from high school into an apprenticeship with the company.",
      "\"I wouldn't say I am worried about AI because where I want to grow is as a field technician, and even though it helps, I don't think AI can take that over,\" he said. \"AI can't go out in the field and take apart an engine.\"",

      "\"The way ChatGPT responds to a 15-year-old should look different than the way it responds to an adult,\" the company said in the announcement.",
      "OpenAI also said it is introducing parental controls, such as enabling parents to link their account to their teen's account, manage chat history, set blackout hours and more. The safeguards will be available by the end of September.",
      "The announcement comes just days after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched a probe into the potential negative effects of AI chatbot companions on children and teens. OpenAI said that it's prioritizing \"making ChatGPT helpful and safe for everyone, and we know safety matters above all else when young people are involved.",
      "Before the FTC probe, OpenAI indicated that it would introduce\u00a0extra safety protections\u00a0for vulnerable users and teens, after the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine of California, who died by suicide in April, sued the company late last month. Raine's family allege that ChatGPT led their teen to commit suicide.",
      "It's unclear how OpenAI plans to indentify users' ages, however, it stated that if ChatGPT is unsure about someone's age, or has incomplete information, it will default to the under-18 version.",
      "OpenAI did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "Other tech companies have taken similar steps to shield teen users from inappropriate content. YouTube, for example, announced a new age-estimation technology that will track the types of videos users watch and how long they've had their account to verify if they are under the age of 18.",
      "According\u00a0to an April Pew Research Center report, parents are generally more worried about the mental health of teenagers than are teens themselves. Among those parents who are at least somewhat concerned about teen mental health, 44% said social media had the biggest negative impact on adolescents.",

      "A federal judge in Oregon has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from sending the National Guard to Portland after the president said he would send troops to the city to handle \"domestic terrorists.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, issued the temporary restraining order, which is set to expire on Oct. 18, according to court records.",
      "The plaintiffs say a deployment would violate the U.S. Constitution as well as a federal law that generally prohibits the military from being used to enforce domestic laws.",
      "Immergut wrote that the case involves the intersection of three fundamental democratic principles: \"the relationship between the federal government and the states, between the military and domestic law enforcement, and the balance of powers between the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government.",
      "\"Whether we choose to follow what the Constitution mandates with respect to these three relationships goes to the heart of what it means to live under the rule of law in the United States,\" she wrote.",
      "Generally speaking the president is allowed \"a great level of deference\" to federalize National Guard troops in situations where regular law enforcement forces are not able to execute the laws of the United States, the judge said.",
      "However, she concluded that in the situation in Portland, the president \"did not have a 'colorable basis' to invoke \u00a7 12406(3) to federalize the National Guard because the situation on the ground belied an inability of federal law enforcement officers to execute federal law.\"",
      "Plaintiffs were able to show that the demonstrations at the Portland immigration facility were not significantly violent or disruptive in the days or weeks leading up to the president's order, the judge wrote, and \"overall, the protests were small and uneventful.\"",
      "The judge added that, \"The President's determination was simply untethered to the facts.\"",
      "The Defense Department had said it was placing 200 members of Oregon's National Guard under federal control for 60 days to protect federal property and personnel at locations where protests are occurring or likely to occur after Trump called the city \"war-ravaged.\"",
      "The state of Oregon filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration on Sunday following the president's announcement that he would send troops to Portland. The lawsuit argued that Mr. Trump lacks the authority to federalize the National Guard.",
      "\"Oregon communities are stable, and our local officials have been clear: we have the capacity to manage public safety without federal interference,\" state Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in a statement.",
      "Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek has pushed back on Mr. Trump's plans to send troops to Portland and told reporters at a news conference last week that the city \"is a far cry from the war-ravaged community he has posted on social media.\"",
      "Earlier in September, Mr. Trump had described living in Portland as \"like living in hell.\"",
      "The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in Portland has been the site of nightly protests, and the demonstrations and occasional clashes with law enforcement.",
      "A handful of immigration and legal advocates often gather at the building during the day. At night, recent protests have typically drawn a couple dozen people.",
      "The order Saturday comes after a broader effort from the administration in what Mr. Trump has characterized as a crackdown on crime in Democratic-led cities.",

      "Born the seventh of 11 children on the south side of Chicago, Curry grew up Catholic\u00a0and attended Catholic schools through college. He was a social worker before becoming a public schoolteacher.",
      "When he and his wife first visited Shekinah Chapel, they were in their mid-twenties, and it was a fledgling congregation in Chicago. \"I never paid attention that it was in a Lutheran Church.\"",
      "The church had a mentoring program for young Black men and boys that he thought could serve some of his middle school students.",
      "\"I had these unique students,\" he said. \"And I was interested in services for them. \u2026 There was a worship service I stayed for. And I loved it.",
      "Shekinah Chapel grew from an ELCA program to an official congregation. Curry went from a lay leader to a more formal leadership role while going to seminary. He was ordained within the ELCA in 2009.",
      "\"That's uncommon where you get to lead in a place where you've been raised,\" Curry said. \"I now recognize how fortunate I am.\"",

      "His path to ministry highlights one way of growing new and diverse congregations within older church structures.",
      "Curry's forerunners as African American Lutheran leaders include the Rev. Nelson Wesley Trout, the first Black ELCA synod bishop, and the Rev. Will Herzfeld, a Black presiding bishop for a predecessor ELCA denomination.",
      "\"Blacks have been around the Lutheran Church since it presented itself in New Amsterdam in the 1600s. We have been present in some small way from the beginning,\" said the Rev. James Thomas, a retired ELCA seminary professor and author of \"A Rumor of Black Lutherans.\"",
      "Around the globe, the largest and fastest-growing Lutheran churches are in Africa.",
      "A benefit of Curry's leadership is that it can help elevate \"the fact that African Americans have been contributing to Lutheranism for a very long time, and not just here in the United States but around the world and in Africa,\" said the Rev. Yolanda Denson-Byers, who wrote \"See Me, Believe Me,\" a book on the challenges leaders of color face in the mainly white ELCA.",
      "Bishop Regina Hassanally of the ELCA Southeastern Minnesota Synod said Curry's elevation is a dual call - for him and the denomination.",
      "\"There can be a temptation to think that calling a leader of color is enough,\" she said. \"But the reality is that it means creating supports and infrastructure and actually allowing that person to lead out of all of their gifts and their full identity, not just one piece of their identity.\"",
      "Curry said his goals include exploring ways for the ELCA to be a more connected church, from local congregations up through the hierarchy. Along with being a welcoming and thriving church, it's one of the goals the denomination has already set.",
      "\"Sometimes you come up with these unique statements and strategies, but then we move on as transition happens,\" he said. \"I want to take something that we've affirmed already and maybe dig a little deeper.\"",

    "story": [
      "WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said Friday there's work to be done to repair relationships with players in the league, while adding that there were \"inaccuracies\" in some of the comments attributed to her by Napheesa Collier in a blistering assessment earlier this week.",
      "\"I was disheartened to hear that some players feel the league and that I personally do not care about them or listen to them,\" Engelbert said before Game 1 of the WNBA Finals on Friday night. \"If the players in the 'W' don't feel appreciated and value from the league, we have to do better and I have to do better.\"",
      "In wide-ranging comments, Engelbert said officiating will be reviewed this offseason by a new \"state of the game\" committee. The commissioner also said the league and the players' union have meetings scheduled for next week to discuss a new collective bargaining agreement. Engelbert also said she plans to remain as commissioner after a CBA is finalized.",
      "As for comments that Collier said Engelbert made in private conversations about Caitlin Clark needing the WNBA to succeed financially, the commissioner denied saying them.",
      "\"Caitlin has been a transformational player in this league. She's been a great representative of the game,\" Engelbert said. \"She's brought in tens of millions of new fans to the game.\"",
      "During her four-minute statement, Collier described an interaction she had with Engelbert in February in which she asked how the league planned to address officiating issues. According to Collier, Engelbert responded that \"only the losers complain about the refs.\"",
      "Engelbert said she's talked to Collier, the Minnesota Lynx star who also said Tuesday that the league has \"the worst leadership in the world\" and a commissioner who lacks accountability.",
      "The two will meet next week, either in person or virtually, Engelbert said.",
      "Meanwhile, Engelbert believes a new CBA deal will get done, albeit not necessarily by the Oct. 31 deadline.",
      "\"That is a real deadline from that perspective. We have extended deadlines in the past,\" she said. \"I know last time when I was only a couple days on the job, we got to an extension and got a deal done. ... I feel confident that we can get a deal done, but if not, I think we could do an extension.\"",
      "Engelbert said higher salaries for players is a goal both sides share.",
      "\"We continue to meet and have important conversations with the players' association. I want to reiterate that we want much of the same things that the players want,\" Engelbert said. \"We want to significantly increase the increase their salary and benefits, while also supporting the long-term growth and viability of the WNBA.\"",
      "Engelbert said it's clear there are differences between the way players and coaches feel about the physical nature of the game and the way the referees officiate.",
      "The committee tasked with reforming officiating will include players, coaches, general managers and others.",
      "\"I think it's pretty clear that we're misaligned currently on what our stakeholders want from officiating,\" Engelbert said. \"We have heard loud and clear that we have not lived up to that needed alignment.\"",
      "Engelbert said the league needs to look at \"good, aggressive play that we recognize has evolved into rough play and how to calibrate the line for legal and illegal content to ensure player safety and exciting competition.\"",
      "Engelbert denied reports that she'll be leaving the WNBA after the new CBA is finished.",
      "\"I've never been a quitter. I'm entering my 40th year, actually, this month in business. Never been a quitter. I've never shied away from tough situations,\" she said.",
      "Engelbert has delivered on many of her promises since coming into the league in 2019. She will have added six expansion teams by 2030 and secured a major new media rights deal for the next decade that will bring in more than $2.2 billion. Engelbert also had the league pay for a full charter flight program this season that the players hope will be added to the new CBA to address concerns about issues ranging from safety to travel time.",
      "The league has enjoyed monumental growth over the last few years, and Engelbert said she knows there's more work to be done.",

      "The album became Spotify's most streamed album in a single day this year. The company said it only took 11 hours to hit that mark.  \"Streaming really does not create a lot of money for artists,\" Evers explained. \"Yes, Taylor Swift is making millions of dollars on streaming, but she's making much more on merch and the vinyl variants.\"",

      "\"The docket is already full of blockbuster cases, and that list is going to grow as challenges to the president's executive orders find their way back to the justices after having been dealt with on the emergency docket,\" Larsen said.",
      "Here are the major cases the Supreme Court will hear this term:",
      "\"Conversion therapy\" ban",
      "The Supreme Court will hear arguments Oct. 7 in a challenge to a Colorado law that bans \"conversion therapy\" for minors. Nearly half the states have similar laws in place.",
      "The law, which took effect in September 2019, prohibits \"conversion therapy\" for people under the age of 18. The state defines \"conversion therapy\" as any practice or treatment, including talk therapy, that attempts to change an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity, including efforts to \"change behaviors or gender expressions or to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attraction or feelings toward individuals of the same sex.\" Violators face fines of up to $5,000 per violation and may be suspended from practicing or stripped of their license.",
      "The case was brought by Kaley Chiles, a licensed counselor in Colorado who performs faith-informed counseling when her clients seek it. Chiles, who is Christian, seeks to engage in talk therapy with young patients who want to \"reduce or eliminate unwanted sexual attractions, change sexual behaviors, or grow in the experience of harmony with [their] physical body,\" according to court filings. But she fears that doing so will leave her in violation of Colorado's law and put her at risk of losing her license.",
      "Chiles sued the state and licensing officials in 2022, arguing that the ban violates her First Amendment rights by censoring her speech based on viewpoint and the content of her conversations. She sought to block Colorado from enforcing it against her.",
      "Colorado officials, meanwhile, argued that its law regulates professional health care treatment to ensure patients receive quality care. States have for centuries regulated professional health care to protect patients from substandard treatment, they said, and the First Amendment has never forbidden states from doing that.",
      "A federal district court ruled for Colorado, finding that its prohibition regulates professional conduct by forbidding certain speech made in a professional context. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit upheld that decision. The appeals court divided 2-1 in finding that the restriction regulates professional conduct that only incidentally burdens speech.",
      "The use of race in redistricting",
      "On Oct. 15, the Supreme Court will consider for the second time the Louisiana congressional map drawn after the 2020 Census.",
      "But the stakes for the case this time around are much higher: The justices are weighing whether the Constitution allows a state to intentionally create a second majority-minority congressional district to comply with the Voting Rights Act.",
      "\"The outcome of the case will not only determine the next steps for Louisiana's congressional map but may also shape the future of redistricting cases nationwide and forecast the resiliency of our nation's democratic values,\" Sophia Lin Lakin, director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project, told reporters during a call.",
      "The long-running dispute involves the interplay between Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the 14th Amendment's guarantee of equal protection under the law. In this case, state lawmakers drew a second majority-Black congressional district to address a Section 2 violation, but bumped up against the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, which prohibits racial gerrymandering.",
      "The case dates back to the first congressional map drawn by Louisiana Republicans and enacted in 2022, which consisted of one majority-Black district and five majority-White districts. African Americans make up nearly one-third of Louisiana's population.",
      "A district judge ruled that map likely violated Section 2 because it deprived minority voters of the chance to elect their preferred candidate. So Louisiana state lawmakers went back to the drawing board and crafted a new map that contained a second majority-minority district.",
      "Republicans said the re-drawn districts brought the map into compliance with the Voting Rights Act and protected key GOP incumbents in the U.S. House, namely House Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Julia Letlow, who sits on the powerful Appropriations Committee.",
      "But a group of 12 self-described \"non-African-Americans\" challenged that new map as a racial gerrymander in violation of the 14th Amendment, and a three-judge panel of district judges agreed. It found that race predominated in drawing the new voting boundaries.",
      "Last March, the Supreme Court heard arguments on whether to keep Louisiana's re-crafted map in place. But in June, it ordered further arguments this term and later asked the parties \u2014 Louisiana officials, the 12 non-African-American voters, and a separate group of Black Louisianans \u2014 to address whether Louisiana's intentional creation of the second majority-minority House district violates the 14th or 15th Amendments.",
      "While Louisiana officials first defended the re-shaped House district lines, they now say the creation of the second majority-Black district in its new voting map violates the Constitution.",
      "The Supreme Court has typically given map-drawers breathing room to navigate the requirements of Section 2 and the 14th Amendment, but the Louisiana case could lead to a weakening of Section 2.",
      "In a 2023 decision that upheld the constitutionality of Section 2 as applied to redistricting, Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested that there should be an end to the drawing of voting boundaries based on race at some point. In a concurring opinion, he wrote \"the authority to conduct race-based redistricting cannot extend indefinitely into the future.\"",
      "Trump's sweeping tariffs",
      "Mr. Trump announced earlier this year that he would be imposing sweeping baseline tariffs on imports from nearly every U.S. trading partner, to address \"chronic trade deficits\" that he said \"are no longer merely an economic \u2014 they're a national emergency.\" He also imposed levies on products from Canada, Mexico and China because of what he said was their failure to stop illicit drugs from flowing into the U.S.",
      "The president used a law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to implement the tariffs. That law gives the president the authority to declare a national emergency to deal with \"any unusual and extraordinary threat\" to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States. Once the president declares a national emergency, IEEPA gives the president the authority to take certain actions, including to regulate importation.",
      "Mr. Trump declared national emergencies related to trade deficits and drug trafficking, and imposed the tariffs under IEEPA to address them.",
      "A group of 12 states and small businesses filed lawsuits challenging Mr. Trump's tariffs, arguing that IEEPA did not give the president the authority to impose his global levies. A federal appeals court sided with the plaintiffs, finding that Mr. Trump's tariffs are illegal. A federal district court in Washington, D.C., also reached the same conclusion.",
      "The Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court, and it agreed to hear the cases on an expedited basis.",
      "The high court has in the past been skeptical of broad presidential authority when it involves what are known in administrative law as \"major questions\" of vast economic and political significance, like when it invalidated former President Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness plan. But the Trump administration has argued that this delegation of power involves foreign affairs and national security, and his determination that tariffs are best suited to address trade-deficit and drug-trafficking emergencies warrant deference.",
      "Martinez predicted the debate in the case will be about textualism and how to look at the language in IEEPA, as well as principles like the major questions doctrine, deference and nondelegation that have been embraced by the Supreme Court's conservative majority.",
      "\"These are all the same kinds of arguments that the conservative side of the court has been pushing very strongly in recent years to limit the use and some would say abuse of executive branch authority,\" Martinez, who clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts, said during an event hosted by Georgetown Law. \"It will be interesting to see how those same principles are applied in this context, where you have a Republican president with a major policy initiative.\"",
      "Campaign finance",
      "The Supreme Court has in a string of recent decisions unraveled campaign finance limits as violations of the First Amendment, which has allowed more money to flow into politics. The latest campaign finance dispute before the justices could follow that trend.",
      "At issue in the case is a 50-year-old provision of campaign finance law that restricts the amount of money political parties can spend in coordination with their candidates during a campaign. For 2024, the limits on coordinated spending by party committees were from $123,600 to $3.7 million for Senate candidates, and between $61,800 and $123,600 for House candidates.",
      "In 2022, two GOP campaign committees, along with then-Senate candidate JD Vance and then-Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio argued these limits were unconstitutional.",
      "A federal appeals court upheld the limits under a 2001 Supreme Court decision that rejected a challenge to an earlier version of the restrictions. But since that ruling 24 years ago, the makeup of the high court has changed significantly and now has a 6-3 conservative majority.",
      "Republicans appealed the lower court decision to the Supreme Court and urged it to strike down the limits on coordinated spending as a violation of the First Amendment.",
      "State laws targeting transgender athletes",
      "On the heels of its June decision upholding a Tennessee law banning certain medical treatments for minors experiencing gender dysphoria, the Supreme Court said it would decide whether states can prohibit transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports.",
      "The justices will be looking at laws from Idaho and West Virginia to determine whether they violate the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection and, in the case involving West Virginia, Title IX. Idaho was the first state to ban transgender athletes from competing in girls' and women's sports, and roughly two dozen have enacted similar laws.",
      "Mr. Trump also signed an executive order in February that aimed to keep transgender girls and women from competing on teams that match their gender identity.",
      "The Idaho case was brought by Lindsay Hecox, a transgender woman who attended Boise State University and wanted to try out for the women's track and cross-country teams as a sophomore. She has been treated for gender dysphoria for several years, including receiving testosterone suppression and estrogen.",
      "A U.S. district court blocked enforcement of Idaho's law, finding the ban discriminates against transgender women. A federal appeals court upheld the injunction as applied to Hecox.",
      "Months after the Supreme Court agreed to take up the case, Hecox decided to dismiss her lawsuit for personal reasons and because of \"negative public scrutiny from certain quarters.\" Her lawyers have asked the Supreme Court to toss out the appeals court's decision and order the case to be dismissed.",
      "The West Virginia case involves Becky Pepper-Jackson, who receives puberty-delaying treatment and estrogen hormone therapy and wanted to participate in girls' athletics in middle school. A federal judge initially blocked the state from enforcing the ban only against Pepper-Jackson, ruling it likely violates Title IX and the Constitution.",
      "But in 2023, the judge sided with the state and upheld the law, finding that the state can legislate sports rules because sex and the physical characteristics that flow from it are related to athletic performance and fairness in sports.",
      "A federal appeals court ruled in 2024, though, that the West Virginia law violated Title IX by discriminating against Pepper-Jackson on the basis of sex.",
      "Trump's power to fire executive officers",
      "Since returning to the White House, Mr. Trump has sought to overhaul the executive branch, including by firing Democratic-appointed officials at independent agencies without cause. He has removed those officers despite federal laws shielding them from being terminated unless for inefficiency, malfeasance in office or neglect of duty.",
      "Lower courts have repeatedly sided with the fired officials and ordered them to be reinstated. But the Supreme Court has allowed Mr. Trump to fire members of the Merit Systems Protection Board, National Labor Relations Board and Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "After allowing those other firings, the Supreme Court agreed to decide whether for-cause removal protections violate the separation of powers. It will also decide whether Mr. Trump can remove Lisa Cook from her position on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.",
      "\"These are cases that raise really profound questions about presidential power \u2026 about Congress' ability to design institutions of government and to insulate certain important functions from the political whims of the day, whether it be setting interest rates or deciding labor relations or nuclear safety,\" lawyer Deepak Gupta told reporters at the Georgetown Law event. Gupta represents Gwynne Wilcox, who was fired from her position as a member of the National Labor Relations Board.",
      "One of the disputes before the high court, which has not yet been scheduled for argument, involves Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, who Mr. Trump removed from her post at the Federal Trade Commission. A district court ruled the president violated a 1914 law that limits the grounds for removing a FTC commissioner to instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "When the case landed before the Supreme Court in an emergency posture, it allowed Mr. Trump to oust Slaughter, and the high court said it would decide the constitutionality of removal protections for the FTC.",
      "The case puts in the Supreme Court's crosshairs a 1935 decision that allowed Congress to enact removal restrictions for officials at certain independent agencies, which the high court has chipped away at in recent years.",
      "The second case, involving Cook, will be argued in January. Mr. Trump attempted to fire Cook from the Fed board after an administration official accused her of mortgage fraud. The effort to remove her is unprecedented, as no president has attempted to fire a sitting Fed governor in the central bank's 112-year-history.",
      "Cook has denied any wrongdoing, and she has not been charged with any criminal offense. A federal judge ruled in September that Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Cook likely violated federal law because he did not state a legally permissible cause for her termination.",
      "The judge also said Cook's due process rights were likely violated because she did not receive notice and an opportunity to be heard before she was ousted.",
      "A federal appeals court rejected a request from the Trump administration to allow the president to fire Cook and agreed with the lower court that Cook did not receive adequate process before her attempted removal. The two-judge majority did not address whether Mr. Trump satisfied the \"for cause\" removal requirement.",
      "In an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, Mr. Trump asked the justices to let him remove Cook from the Fed Board while the challenge to her firing moved forward. But the high court declined to immediately rule on his request for relief, and instead said it will hear arguments in January.",
      "By putting off a decision, the Supreme Court let Cook remain a Fed governor while it considers the issue.",
      "Gun rights",
      "Just before the start of the new term, the Supreme Court said it will decide whether Hawaii can stop people with concealed-carry permits from bringing their handguns onto private property that is open to the public, unless they receive \"express authorization\" from the property owner.",
      "The case involves firearms restrictions enacted in Hawaii in 2023, on the heels of the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling that expanded gun rights. The measure prohibits people with concealed-carry permits from carrying handguns on different types of property, including beaches, playgrounds, bars and restaurants that serve liquor, and other \"sensitive\" locations.",
      "The restriction at issue in the case before the Supreme Court bars people with concealed-carry licenses from bringing handguns onto private property unless they receive permission from the property owner. Four other states \u2014 California, Maryland, New Jersey, and New York \u2014 have similar laws that require a property owner's approval before carrying firearms on private property, such as by posting signs stating that guns are allowed.",
      "The Hawaii Firearms Coalition and three gun owners with concealed-carry permits challenged the law in June 2023, and a federal appeals court ultimately upheld the provision related to private property.",
      "Lawyers for the gun owners argued that the 9th Circuit effectively found that the Second Amendment does not apply to private property open to the public, rendering \"illusory the right to carry in public.\" The Trump administration had\u00a0urged the Supreme Court\u00a0to take up the dispute, warning that because few property owners post signs allowing or prohibiting guns, Hawaii's restriction functioned as a \"near-complete ban on public carry.\"",
      "Hawaii officials, meanwhile, said the rule regarding private property \"represents a permissible effort to vindicate the rights of Hawaii's citizens.\" They argued that under its law, a person who wants to bring a gun into a store can simply ask for oral permission.",
      "Since its June 2022 decision recognizing the Second Amendment's right to bear arms extends to outside the home, the Supreme Court has been asked to decide the constitutionality of a number of longstanding firearms restrictions and state laws. Last year, the high court upheld a federal law prohibiting people subject to a domestic violence restraining order from having firearms.",
      "But it has also declined to take up challenges to state bans on assault weapons and other federal measures.",

      "A popular Alaskan climber fell to his death from Yosemite National Park's El Capitan, marking the third death in the park this summer.",
      "Balin Miller, 23, died in a climbing accident Wednesday, his mother Jeanine Girard-Moorman confirmed.",
      "\"He's been climbing since he was a young boy,\" she said. \"His heart and soul was truly to just climb. He loved to climb and it was never about money and fame.\"",
      "The death comes on the first day of the federal government shutdown, which left national parks \"generally\" open, with limited operations and closed visitors centers, according to the National Park Service. The park service said in a statement that they are investigating the incident and \"park rangers and emergency personnel responded immediately.\"",
      "El Capitan is one of the most striking features of Yosemite National Park, an enormous sheer granite rock face of approximately 3,000 feet (915 meters) that entices big-wall rock climbers from all over the world. Alex Honnold completed the first free solo climb of El Capitan in 2017 for the documentary \"Free Solo.\"",
      "Many posted tributes to Miller on social media, saying they had watched him climb on a TikTok livestream for two days before his death and referring to him as \"orange tent guy\" because of his distinctive camp setup.",
      "Earlier this year, an 18-year-old from Texas died in the park while free-soloing, or climbing without a rope, on a different formation. In August, a 29-year-old woman died after being struck in the head by a large tree branch while hiking.",
      "While it's still unclear exactly what happened, his older brother, Dylan Miller, said Balin was lead rope soloing \u2014 a way to climb alone while still protected by a rope \u2014 on a 2,400-foot (730-meter) route named Sea of Dreams. He had already finished the climb and was hauling up his last bit of gear when he likely rappelled off the end of his rope, Dylan said.",
      "Miller was an accomplished alpinist who had already gained international attention for claiming the first solo ascent of Mount McKinley's Slovak Direct, a technically difficult route that took him 56 hours to complete, he posted on his Instagram in June.",
      "He grew up climbing in Alaska with his brother and their father, who was also a climber. While Dylan took a little more time to fall in love with the sport, it stuck with his younger sibling instantly.",
      "\"He said he felt most alive when he was climbing,\" Dylan Miller said. \"I'm his bigger brother but he was my mentor.\"",
      "This year, Balin Miller had also spent weeks solo climbing in Patagonia and the Canadian Rockies, ticking off a notoriously difficult ice climb called Reality Bath, which had been unrepeated for 37 years, according to Climbing magazine.",
      "\"He's had probably one of the most impressive last six months of climbing of anyone that I can think of,\" Clint Helander, an Alaska alpinist, told the Anchorage Daily News.",
      "But this most recent trip to Yosemite wasn't supposed to be hard climbing. Miller had just arrived two weeks early to climb and enjoy the park's beauty and solitude before the rest of his family, who planned to meet up there.",
      "More than just a climber, he loved animals and was fun, kind and full of life, his mother said.",
      "He often climbed with a stripe of glitter freckles across his cheekbones, describing it in a Climbing magazine interview like \"a warrior putting makeup on before going into battle.\"",
      "\"He has inspired so many people to do things that are perhaps unthinkable, including myself. I can't imagine climbing ever again without him,\" his brother said.",

    "story": [
      "Louisville, Tenn. \u2014 When a big storm hits, Peninsula Hospital could be underwater.",
      "At this decades-old psychiatric hospital on the edge of the Tennessee River, an intense storm could submerge the building in 11 feet of water, cutting off all roads around the facility, according to a sophisticated computer simulation of flood risk.",
      "Aurora, a young woman who was committed to Peninsula as a teenager, said the hospital sits so close to the river that it felt like a moat keeping her and dozens of other patients inside. KFF Health News agreed not to publish her full name because she shared private medical history.",
      "\"My first feeling is doom,\" Aurora said as she watched the simulation of the river rising around the hospital. \"These are probably some of the most vulnerable people.\"",
      "Covenant Health, which runs Peninsula Hospital, said in a statement it has a \"proactive and thorough approach to emergency planning\" but declined to provide details or answer questions.",
      "Peninsula is one of about 170 American hospitals, totaling nearly 30,000 patient beds from coast to coast, that face the greatest risk of significant or dangerous flooding, according to a monthslong KFF Health News investigation based on data provided by Fathom, a company considered a leader in flood simulation. At many of these hospitals, flooding from heavy storms has the potential to jeopardize patient care, block access to emergency rooms, and force evacuations. Sometimes there is no other hospital nearby.",
      "Much of this risk to hospitals is not captured by flood maps issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which have served as the nation's de facto tool for flood estimation for half a century, despite being incomplete and sometimes decades out of date. As FEMA's maps have become divorced from the reality of a changing climate, private companies like Fathom have filled the gap with simulations of future floods. But many of their predictions are behind a paywall, leaving the public mostly reliant on free, significantly limited government maps.",
      "\"This is highly concerning,\" said Caleb Dresser, who studies climate change and is both an emergency room doctor and a Harvard University assistant professor. \"If you don't have the information to know you're at risk, then how can you triage that problem?\"",
      "The deadliest hospital flooding in modern American history occurred 20 years ago during Hurricane Katrina, when the bodies of 45 people were recovered from New Orleans' Memorial Medical Center, including some patients whom investigators\u00a0suspected were euthanized. More flooding deaths were narrowly avoided one year ago when helicopters rescued\u00a0dozens of people as Hurricane Helene engulfed Unicoi County Hospital in Erwin, Tennessee.",
      "Rebecca Harrison, a paramedic, called her children from the Unicoi roof to say goodbye.",
      "\"I was scared to death, thinking, 'This is it,'\" Harrison told CBS News, which interviewed Unicoi survivors as part of KFF Health News' investigation. \"Alarms were going off. People were screaming. It was chaos.\"",
      "The investigation \u2014 among the first to analyze nationwide hospital flood risk in an era of warming climate and worsening storms \u2014 comes as the administration of President Donald Trump has slashed federal agencies that\u00a0forecast and\u00a0respond\u00a0to extreme weather and also dismantled FEMA programs designed to protect hospitals and other important buildings from floods.",
      "When asked to comment, FEMA said flooding is a common, costly, and \"under appreciated\" disaster but made no statement specific to hospitals. Spokesperson Daniel Llargu\u00e9s defended the administration's changes to FEMA by reissuing an August statement that dismissed criticism as coming from \"bureaucrats who presided over decades of inefficiency.\"",
      "Alice Hill, an Obama administration climate risk expert, said the Trump administration's dismissal of climate change and worsening floods would waste billions of dollars and endanger lives.",
      "In 2015, Hill led the creation of the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard, which required that hospitals and other essential structures be elevated or incorporate extra flood protections to qualify for federal funding.",
      "FEMA\u00a0stopped enforcing the standard in March.",
      "\"People will die as a result of some of the choices being made today,\" Hill said. \"We will be less prepared than we are now. And we already were, in my estimation, poorly prepared.\"",
      "\"Flood risk is everywhere\"",
      "The KFF Health News investigation identified more than 170 hospitals facing a flood risk by comparing the locations of more than 7,000 facilities to\u00a0peer-reviewed flood hazard mapping provided by Fathom, a United Kingdom company that simulates flooding in spaces as small as 10 meters using laser-precision elevation measurements from the\u00a0U.S. Geological Survey.",
      "Hospitals were determined to have a significant risk if Fathom's 100-year flood data predicted that a foot or more of water could reach a considerable portion of their buildings, excluding parking garages, or cut off road access to the hospital. A 100-year flood is an intense weather event that has roughly a 1% chance of occurring in any given year but can happen more often.",
      "The investigation found heightened flood risks at large trauma centers, small rural hospitals, children's hospitals, and long-term care facilities that serve older and disabled patients. At least 21 are critical access hospitals, with the next-closest hospital 25 miles away, on average.",
      "Flooding threatens dozens of hospitals in coastal areas, including in Florida, Louisiana, Texas, and New York. Farther inland, flooding of rivers or creeks could envelop other hospitals, particularly in Appalachia and the Midwest. Even in the sun-soaked cities and arid expanses of the American West, storms have the potential to surround some hospitals with several feet of pooling water, according to Fathom's data.",
      "These findings are likely an undercount of hospitals at risk because the investigation overlooked pockets of potential flooding at some hospitals. It excluded facilities like stand-alone ERs, outpatient clinics, and nursing homes.",
      "\"The reality is that flood risk is everywhere. It is the most pervasive of perils,\" said Oliver Wing, the chief scientific officer at Fathom, who reviewed the findings. \"Just because you haven't experienced an extreme doesn't mean you never will.\"",
      "Dresser, the ER doctor, said even a small amount of flooding can shut down an unprepared hospital, often by interrupting its power supply, which is needed for life-sustaining equipment like ventilators and heart monitors. He said the most vulnerable hospitals would likely be in rural areas.",
      "\"A lot of rural hospitals are now closing their pediatric units, closing their psychiatry units,\" Dresser said. \"In a financially stressed situation, it can be hard to prioritize long-term threats, even if they are, for some institutions, potentially existential.\"",
      "Urban hospitals can face dangerous flooding, too. Fathom's data predicts 5 to 15 feet of water around neighboring hospitals \u2014 Kadlec Regional Medical Center and Lourdes Behavioral Health \u2014 that straddle a tiny creek in Richland, Washington.",
      "By Fathom's estimate, a 100-year flood could cause the nearby Columbia River to spill over a levee that protects Richland, then loosely follow the creek to the hospitals. Some of the deepest flooding is estimated around Lourdes, which was built on land the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers set aside in 1961 as a \"ponding and drainage easement.\"",
      "At the time, this land was supposed to be capable of storing enough water to fill at least 40 Olympic-size swimming pools, according to\u00a0military documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. A mental health facility has occupied this spot since the 1970s.",
      "Both Kadlec and Lourdes said in statements that they have disaster plans but did not answer questions about flooding. Tina Baumgardner, a Lourdes spokesperson, said government flood maps show the hospital is not in a 100-year flood plain.",
      "This is not uncommon. Of the more than 170 hospitals with significant flood risk identified by KFF Health News, one-third are located in areas that FEMA has not designated as flood hazard zones.",
      "Sometimes the difference is stark. For example, at Ochsner Choctaw General in Alabama \u2014 the only hospital for 30 miles in any direction \u2014 FEMA maps suggest a 100-year flood would overflow a nearby creek but spare the hospital. Fathom's data predicts the same event would flood most of the hospital with 1 to 2 feet of water, including the ER and the helicopter pad.",
      "Loading...",
      "Ochsner Health did not answer questions about flooding preparations at Choctaw General.",
      "FEMA flood maps were launched in the '60s as part of the National Flood Insurance Program to determine where insurance is required and building codes should include flood-proofing. According to a FEMA statement, the maps show only a \"snapshot in time\" and are not intended to predict where flooding will or won't happen.",
      "FEMA spokesperson Geoff Harbaugh said the agency intends to modernize its maps through the Future of Flood Risk Data initiative, which will enable the agency to \"better project flood risk\" and give Americans \"the information they need to protect their lives and property.\"",
      "The program was launched by the first Trump administration in 2019 but has since received sparse public updates. Harbaugh declined to provide a detailed update or timeline for the program.",
      "Chad Berginnis, executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers, said it is unknown whether FEMA is still trying to upgrade its maps under Mr. Trump, as the agency has cut off communications with outside flooding experts.",
      "\"There has been not a single bit of loosening of what I'm calling the FEMA cone of silence,\" Berginnis said. \"I've never seen anything like it.\"",
      "Floods are expected to worsen as a warming climate fuels stronger storms, drenching areas that are already flood-prone and bringing a new level of flooding to areas once considered lower risk.",
      "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has said that 2024 was the warmest year on record \u2014 more than 2 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the 20th-century average. Scientists across the globe\u00a0have estimated that each degree of global warming correlates to a 4% increase in the intensity of extreme rainfall.",
      "\"Warmer air can hold more moisture, so this leads us to experience heavier downpours,\" said Kelly Van Baalen, a sea level rise expert at the nonprofit\u00a0Climate Central. \"A 100-year flood today could be a 10-year flood tomorrow.\"",
      "Intensifying storms raise concerns about Peninsula Hospital, which has operated for decades mere feet from the Tennessee River but has no known history of flooding.",
      "Peninsula spokesperson Josh Cox said the river is overseen by the Tennessee Valley Authority, which uses dams to manage water levels and generate electricity. Estimates provided by the TVA suggest the dams could keep Peninsula dry even in a 500-year flood.",
      "Fathom, however, said its flood simulation accounts for the dams and stressed that a large enough storm could drop more rain than even the TVA could control. These predictions are echoed by another flood modeling firm,\u00a0First Street, which also says an intense storm could cause more than 10 feet of flooding in the area around Peninsula.",
      "\"It's a hospital right on the banks of a major American river,\" said Wing, the Fathom scientist. \"It just isn't conceivable that such a location is risk-free.\"",
      "Jack Goodwin, 75, a retired TVA employee who has lived next to Peninsula for three decades, said he was confident the dams could protect the area. But after reviewing Fathom's predictions, Goodwin began to research flood insurance.",
      "\"Water can rise quickly and suddenly, and the destruction is tremendous,\" he said. \"Just because we've never seen it here doesn't mean we won't see it.\"",
      "\"All the elements of a real disaster\"",
      "One year ago, as Hurricane Helene carved a deadly path across Southern Appalachia, Angel Mitchell was visiting her ailing mother at Unicoi County Hospital in the tiny town of Erwin, Tennessee.",
      "Swollen by Helene, the nearby Nolichucky River spilled over its banks and around\u00a0 the hospital, which was built in a flood plain. Staff tried to bar the doors, Mitchell said, but the water got\u00a0 in, trapping her and others inside. The lights went out. People fled to the roof, where the roar of rushing water nearly drowned out the approach of rescue helicopters, Mitchell said.",
      "Ultimately, 70 people, including Mitchell and her mother, were\u00a0airlifted to safety on Sept. 27, 2024, narrowly escaping the hospital without a single death. The hospital remains closed, and the company that owns it,\u00a0Ballad Health, has said its\u00a0reopening is uncertain.",
      "\"Why allow something \u2014 especially a hospital \u2014 to be built in an area like that?\" Mitchell told CBS News. \"People have to rely on these areas to get medical help, and they're dangerous.\"",
      "Beyond Unicoi, KFF Health News identified 39 inland hospitals \u2014 including 16 in Appalachia \u2014 that Fathom predicts could flood when nearby rivers, creeks, or drainage canals overspill their banks, even in storms far less intense than Helene.",
      "For example, in the Cumberland Mountains of southwestern Virginia, a 100-year flood is projected to cause Slate Creek to engulf Buchanan General Hospital in more than 5 feet of water.",
      "Near the Great Lakes in Erie, Pennsylvania, LECOM Medical Center and Behavioral Health Pavilion could become flooded by a small drainage creek that is less than 50 feet from the front door of the ER.",
      "Neither Buchanan nor LECOM responded to questions about flooding or preparations.",
      "And in West Virginia's capital of Charleston, where about 50,000 people live at the junction of two rivers in a wide and flat valley, a single storm could potentially flood five of the city's six hospitals at once, along with schools, churches, fire departments, and other facilities.",
      "\"I hate to say it,\" said Behrang Bidadian, a flood plain manager at the\u00a0West Virginia GIS Technical Center, \"but it has all the elements of a real disaster.\"",
      "At the largest hospital in Charleston, CAMC Memorial Hospital, Fathom predicts that the Kanawha River could bring as much as 5 feet of flooding to the ER. Across town, the Elk River could surround CAMC Women and Children's Hospital, cutting off all exits.",
      "And in the center of the city, where the overflowing rivers are predicted to merge, Thomas Orthopedic Hospital could be besieged by more than 10 feet of water on three sides.",
      "WVU Medicine, which owns Thomas Orthopedic Hospital, did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "CAMC spokesperson Dale Witte said the hospital system is aware of its flood risk and has prepared by elevating electrical infrastructure and acquiring flood-proofing equipment, like a deployable floodwall. CAMC also regularly revises and drills its disaster plans, Witte said, although he added that hospitals there have never been tested by a real flood.",
      "Shanen Wright, 48, a lifelong Charleston resident who lives near CAMC Memorial, said many in the city have little worry about flooding in the face of more immediate problems, like the opioid epidemic and the decline of manufacturing and mining.",
      "Tugboats and coal barges sail past his neighborhood as if they were cars on his street.",
      "\"It's not to say it's not a possibility,\" he said. \"I'm sure the people in Asheville and the people in Texas, where the floods took so many lives, they probably didn't see it coming either.\"",
      "\"The water is coming\"",
      "Despite wide scientific consensus that climate change fuels more dangerous weather, the Trump administration has\u00a0taken the position that concerns about global warming are overblown. In a speech to the United Nations in September, Mr. Trump called climate change \"the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.\"",
      "The Trump administration has made deep staff and funding cuts to FEMA, NOAA, and the National Weather Service. At FEMA, the cuts prompted 191 current and former employees to\u00a0publish a letter in August warning that the agency is being dismantled from within.",
      "Daniel Swain, a University of California climate scientist, said the administration's rejection of climate change has left the nation less prepared for extreme weather, now and in the future.",
      "\"It's akin to enforcing malpractice scientifically,\" Swain said. \"Imagine making a medical decision where you are not allowed to look at 20% of the patient's vital signs or test results.\"",
      "Under Mr. Trump, FEMA has also taken actions critics say will leave the nation more vulnerable to flooding, specifically:",
      "FEMA disbanded the Technical Mapping Advisory Council, which had\u00a0repeatedly pushed the agency to modernize its flood maps to estimate future risk and account for the impacts of climate change.FEMA canceled its\u00a0Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, which provided grants to help communities and vital buildings, including hospitals, protect themselves from floods and other natural disasters.And after stopping enforcement early this year, FEMA\u00a0intends to rescind the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard, which was designed to harden buildings against future floods and save tax dollars in the long run.",

      "Berginnis, of the Association of State Floodplain Managers, said the administration's unwillingness to prepare for climate change and worsening storms would result in a dangerous and costly cycle of flooding, rebuilding, and flooding again.",
      "\"The president is saying we are closed for business when it comes to hazard mitigation,\" Berginnis said. \"It bugs me to no end that we have to have reminders \u2014 like people dying \u2014 to show us why it's important to make these investments.\"",
      "FEMA did not answer specific questions about these decisions. In the statement to KFF Health News, spokesperson Llargu\u00e9s touted the administration's response to flooding in Texas and New Mexico and said FEMA had provided billions of dollars to help people and communities recover and rebuild. He did not mention any FEMA funding for protecting against future floods.",
      "Few hospitals understand this threat more than the former Coney Island Hospital in New York City, which has suffered catastrophic flooding before and has prepared for it to come again.",
      "Superstorm Sandy in 2012 forced the hospital to evacuate hundreds of patients. When the water receded, fish and a sea turtle were found in the building.",
      "Eleven years later, the facility reopened as Ruth Bader Ginsburg Hospital, transformed by a FEMA-funded $923 million reconstruction project that added a 4-foot floodwall and elevated patient care areas and utility infrastructure above the first floor.",
      "It is now likely one of the most flood-proofed hospitals in the nation.",
      "But, so far, no storm has tested the facility.",
      "Svetlana Lipyanskaya, CEO of NYC Health+Hospitals/South Brooklyn Health, which includes the rebuilt hospital, said the question of flooding is \"not an if but a when.\"",
      "\"I hope it doesn't happen in my lifetime,\" she said, \"but frankly, I'd be surprised. The water is coming.\"",

      "Methodology",
      "After Hurricane Helene made landfall a year ago, a raging river flooded a rural hospital in eastern Tennessee. Patients and employees were rescued from the rooftop. Floods have hit hospitals from New York to Nebraska to Texas in recent years. We wanted to determine how many other U.S. hospitals face similar peril. Ultimately, we found more than 170 hospitals at risk.",
      "For this analysis, we used data from Fathom, a United Kingdom-based company that specializes in flood-risk modeling across the globe. To assess the United States' vulnerability, Fathom uses sophisticated computer simulations and detailed terrain data covering the country. It accounts for environmental factors such as climate change, soil conditions, and many rivers and creeks not mapped by other sources. Fathom's modeling has been peer-reviewed and used by insurance companies, the World Bank, the Nature Conservancy, and government agencies in Florida, Texas, and elsewhere. The Iowa Flood Center has validated Fathom's U.S. data.",
      "Through a data use agreement, Fathom shared its U.S. mapping data that predicts areas with at least a 1% chance of flooding in any given year. Fathom's data estimates the effects of three main types of flooding: coastal, fluvial (from overflowing rivers, lakes, or streams), and pluvial (rainfall that the ground can't absorb). The data also accounts for dams, reservoirs, and other structures that defend against floods.",
      "To identify at-risk hospitals, we used a publicly available Department of Homeland Security database containing the GPS coordinates of more than 7,000 short-term acute, critical access, rehab, and psychiatric hospitals \u2014 basically any hospital with inpatient services. (DHS under the Trump administration has discontinued public access to the database, so data for hospitals and other infrastructure is no longer widely available.)",
      "Using GPS coordinates as the centerpoint, we created a circle with a 150-yard radius around each hospital, which in most cases captured the building plus nearby grounds and access roads. We then mapped Fathom's flood-risk data to see where it overlapped with these circles. We started by looking for hospitals where at least 20% of the circle's area had a predicted flood depth of at least 1 foot. That gave us an initial list of more than 320 hospitals across the U.S.",
      "From there, we visually inspected those hospitals using mapping software and Google Maps, both satellite and street view. We trimmed our list to only the hospitals where a considerable portion of the building or all access roads were predicted to have at least a foot of flooding.",
      "If two hospitals were mapped to the same building \u2014 for instance, a small rehab facility within a large hospital \u2014 we counted only one hospital. We also excluded hospitals recently converted to nursing homes or for other uses.",
      "We ended up with a list of 171 hospitals across the U.S. That is most likely an undercount. Some hospitals could still face significant impact from flooding that is not deep enough or widespread enough to fit our methodology. Our analysis also does not account for how flooding farther from a hospital could affect employees or patients. And it does not assess what steps hospitals may have already taken to prepare for severe weather events.",
      "We also ran a spatial analysis comparing Fathom's data with flood hazard maps from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which in many cases are incomplete or haven't been updated in years. We found that about a third of hospitals identified as flood risks by Fathom's data did not overlap at all with FEMA's 100- or 500-year hazard areas.",
      "Fathom provided guidance and feedback as we developed our analysis.",

    "summary": "\"I am very happy doing what I am doing,\" says one young electrician who pursued a skilled trade as AI disrupts the job market for college grads.",
    "story": [
      "At just 23, Jacob Palmer is already running his own electrical company. He launched the business in 2024 after starting in the field as an apprentice electrician, a career path he embarked on when college turned out not to be for him.",
      "Palmer has no regrets about his decision to forego college and instead establish himself as a tradesman. \"I am very happy doing what I am doing now because it has given me the opportunity to work for myself and be independent,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Experts say the skilled trades \u2014 jobs like electricians, plumbers, welders, masons, HVAC technicians and other occupations requiring extensive training and often licensing \u2014 are attracting a growing number of young people put off by high tuition costs.",
      "More than 57% of Gen Zers surveyed by Jobber, a software tool for service businesses, cite student loan debt as a concern about going to college, according to the company's annual report on attitudes toward blue-collar jobs.",
      "More recently, signs that\u00a0artificial intelligence is starting to gobble up the kind of entry-level jobs that once went to young college graduates are also leading young workers to consider the trades. Some 77% of Gen Zers say it's important that their future job is hard to automate, with many pointing to professions like carpenter, plumber, and electrician as occupations they believe are safe from automation. By contrast, they see less security in fields like software development, data analytics, and accounting, according to the survey.",
      "\"That route is losing some of the stigma,\" said David Asay, president of Advantage Reline, a trenchless pipe rehabilitation company in Mesa, Arizona. \"The perception among that younger group is no longer, 'Oh, you're working construction, you didn't go to school?' It's, 'What a cool skillset. You're making a good career path.'\"",
      "Harder path for college grads",
      "For decades, many young people shunned the trades, with everyone from economists and career experts to politicians and parents emphasizing the importance of obtaining a college diploma. That conventional wisdom isn't entirely wrong \u2014 it's just behind the times.",
      "\"The attitude was that jobs in the trades were less than desirable,\" said Angie Hicks, co-founder of Angi, an online home improvement services guide told CBS News.",
      "But several factors are contributing to a shift in how people are thinking about such occupations. For one, going to college for many Americans often requires going into debt. The average cost of college, including tuition and room and board, now tops\u00a0$38,000 a year and is approaching $60,000 for private institutions, according to the Education Data Initiative.",
      "Factoring in the added burden of interest on student loans and potential income one foregoes while in school, the total cost of earning a bachelor's degree can exceed $500,000, the research firm has found.",
      "More recently, economists also point to a jump in unemployment for recent college grads, which some experts say is an early warning sign that AI is taking jobs away from less experienced workers. The jobless rate for 23-to-27-year-old college grads this year now hovers around 4.6%, up from 3.2% for the same demographic in 2019.",
      "Strikingly, non-college-educated workers in the same age range have experienced a much smaller uptick in unemployment, at roughly 0.5%, over the same period, according to an analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "\"AI can't go out in the field\"",
      "Vinnie Curcie, founder and CEO of OC Solar, a solar installation company in Irvine, California, said the solar energy field differs from other trades in that the work requires time both in the office and in the field. OC Solar offers three main services \u2014 solar panel and battery sales, project management and installation services. But he expects AI will soon handle much of the sales and project management sides of the business.",
      "While prospective employees once tended to have stronger interest in the company's marketing, management or other white-collar roles, more job candidates today are eager for roles in the field.",
      "\"More people are interested in the field because they know that's where the job security is,\" Curcie told CBS News.",
      "Some school districts also report seeing growing student interest in blue-collar careers. Marlo Loria, director of career and technical education and innovative partnerships at Mesa Public Schools in Mesa, Arizona, said more of her students are enrolling in schools' welding, construction and auto shop programs than there is space for.",
      "Asay, of Advantage Reline, added that students with an entrepreneurial bent can also be well-suited for the skilled trades.",
      "\"They can take their skills and create their own business, or become a bigger part of our business, outside of being someone with a shovel in a trench,\" he said.",
      "Palmer said his business generated $90,000 in revenue in its first year and is on track to top $150,000 in 2025, a more than 30% increase \u2014 no college degree needed. The other upside to life as an electrician, as he sees it, is the job security.",
      "\"I don't feel overly threatened by the growth of AI in my industry. That will be a pretty impressive robot that can do my job one day, if it ever happens,\" Palmer said.",
      "Kayden Evans, an 18-year-old senior at Mountain View High School in Mesa, Arizona, has his eyes set on a career working with his hands, and to eventually start his own business. Currently an intern at Empire Cat, a company that sells, rents and services heavy equipment and tractors, he plans on going straight from high school into an apprenticeship with the company.",

    "published": "Sat, 04 Oct 2025 16:26:09 -0400",
    "summary": "The plan called for Hamas to return all Israeli hostages and for the Israeli military to begin withdrawing from parts of the Gaza Strip in phases.",
    "story": [
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he hopes to announce the release of all hostages from Gaza \"in the coming days,\" after Hamas said it has agreed to parts of the peace plan that President Trump\u00a0outlined earlier this week.",
      "In a brief statement late Saturday, Netanyahu said he has sent a delegation to Egypt \"to finalize technical details,\" adding that \"our goal is to contain these negotiations to a time frame of a few days.\"",
      "But Netanyahu signaled there would not be a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, something Hamas has long demanded.",
      "On Friday, Hamas said in a statement that while they agreed to parts of the peace deal, including the demand to release all hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, the group suggested other portions of the deal should be subject to negotiation.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News the United States views Hamas' response as positive, though there are details that still need to be hammered out, such as the decommissioning of weapons, which may begin as soon as next week.",
      "After Hamas released its statement, Mr. Trump said Friday on Truth Social that he believes the group is \"ready for a lasting PEACE.\" He pushed Israel to cease hostilities in the Gaza Strip.",
      "\"Israel must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the Hostages out safely and quickly! Right now, it's far too dangerous to do that. We are already in discussions on details to be worked out,\" the president wrote.",
      "\"In light of Hamas's response, Israel is preparing to immediately implement the first phase of Trump's plan for the immediate release of all hostages,\" a statement released by Netanyahu's office early Saturday morning local time read. \"We will continue to work in full cooperation with the President and his team to end the war in accordance with the principles set forth by Israel that are consistent with President Trump's vision.\"",
      "In a separate statement, the Israel Defense Forces said that its high-level military officials held a meeting overnight, in which Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, the IDF chief of staff, \"instructed to advance readiness for the implementation of the first phase of the Trump plan for the release of the hostages.\"",
      "An Israeli political source told CBS News that the cessation of the IDF's activity in the Gaza Strip is intended to allow Hamas to begin organizing for the release of the hostages. The source added that this is not an official ceasefire that would require Hamas to return the hostages within 72 hours, as outlined in the plan.",
      "\"This is not the beginning of a withdrawal, although there may be tactical improvements for the purpose of protecting our soldiers,\" the source added. \"We are constantly examining what is happening on the ground and will not allow the terrorist organizations to try to take advantage of the opportunity and carry out a last-minute attack, or to strengthen their grip on the ground.\"",
      "The source said the negotiations are expected to begin on Sunday.",
      "Meanwhile, another source familiar with Israel's negotiation team told CBS News that it was getting ready to travel.",
      "U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, is set to travel to Egypt for the talks, a senior U.S. official confirmed to CBS News. Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, is also expected to attend. CBS News has reached out to the White House for more details.",
      "In a video posted to Truth Social later Friday, Mr. Trump called the deal \"unprecedented in many ways\" and thanked several Arab and majority Muslim countries that assisted with the deal as mediators, including Qatar and Egypt.",
      "\"This is a big day,\" Mr. Trump said in the video. \"We'll see how it all turns out. We have to get the final word down and concrete.\"",
      "In a follow-up post to Truth Social Saturday afternoon, Mr. Trump wrote: \"After negotiations, Israel has agreed to the initial withdrawal line, which we have shown to, and shared with, Hamas. When Hamas confirms, the Ceasefire will be IMMEDIATELY effective, the Hostages and Prisoner Exchange will begin, and we will create the conditions for the next phase of withdrawal, which will bring us close to the end of this 3,000 YEAR CATASTROPHE. Thank you for your attention to this matter and, STAY TUNED!\"",
      "The post included a map of what the proposed withdrawal line could look like.",
      "Also Saturday, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the second most powerful militant group in Gaza, said it accepted Hamas' response to the Trump plan. The group had previously rejected the proposal days earlier.",
      "Hamas says it's willing to release hostages, hand over control of Gaza",
      "Hamas said it is willing to release all living hostages and the remains of deceased hostages \"in accordance with the exchange formula set forth in President Trump's proposal.\" The proposal laid out by the White House called for Hamas to release all hostages taken on Oct. 7, 2023, within 72 hours, and for Israel to release 250 Palestinians serving life sentences and 1,700 other Gazans who were detained following the start of the conflict.",
      "The deal also called for an immediate end to fighting if both sides accept the deal, and for Israel's military to withdraw to an \"agreed upon line.\"",
      "Hamas also said it is willing to \"hand over the administration of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian body of independents (technocrats), based on Palestinian national consensus and with the support of Arab and Islamic parties\" \u2014 another portion of Mr. Trump's proposal.",
      "A senior Egyptian official told the AP that talks are underway for the release of hostages, as well as hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli detention. The official, who is involved in the ceasefire negotiations, also said Arab mediators are preparing for a comprehensive dialogue among Palestinians. The talks are aimed at unifying the Palestinian position toward Gaza's future.",
      "The group was less clear on other portions of the deal. The statement said some aspects of Mr. Trump's proposal \"remain linked to a comprehensive national stance, grounded in relevant international laws and resolutions.\" It said those issues will need to be discussed \"within an inclusive Palestinian national framework\" that includes Hamas.",
      "It's not clear if Hamas has agreed that it will play no role in the governance of Gaza, which was one provision of Mr. Trump's proposal.",
      "The plan, unveiled Sept. 29 by Mr. Trump and backed by Netanyahu, called for Hamas to free all remaining Israeli hostages and for the Israeli military to begin withdrawing from parts of the Gaza Strip in phases, starting with an initial withdrawal before the hostages are freed. It also proposed handing over parts of Gaza to a \"technocratic\" Palestinian committee and deploying a temporary security force backed by Arab states.",
      "Netanyahu, who joined Mr. Trump for a joint news conference at the White House when the 20-point proposal was announced, had said he supports the plan, and that if Hamas does not accept the offer, \"Israel will finish the job by itself.\"",
      "\"We're giving everybody a chance to have this done peacefully,\" Netanyahu had said, warning Hamas what would happen if they didn't agree to the proposal. \"But if Hamas rejects your plan, Mr. President, or if they supposedly accept it and then basically do everything to counter it, then Israel will finish the job by itself. This can be done the easy way or it can be done the hard way, but it will be done.\"",
      "The president told Netanyahu on Monday that if Hamas were to reject the proposal, \"you'd have our full backing to do what you would have to do.\"",
      "Mr. Trump had said his goal is to ensure a \"sustainable, long-term peace.\" The president on Monday also said he and Netanyahu were \"waiting for signatures and waiting for approvals from a lot of different countries that are involved in this.\"",
      "Israel and Hamas have been at war since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led terrorists attacked southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. Since then, Israel has waged an intense aerial bombardment and ground campaign in the Gaza Strip. More than 66,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not specify how many of the dead were civilians or militants.",
      "Some 50 hostages are still in Gaza, fewer than half of whom are believed to be alive, according to Israeli authorities.",

      "A Kurdish group called the Hengaw Organization for Human Rights reported the men's execution, identifying them all as \"Arab political prisoners\" detained during protests in 2019.

      "Federal police said two drone sightings were confirmed shortly before 11 p.m. Friday near the airport's north and south runways, the agency said in a statement Saturday. The drones flew away before they could be identified.",

    "summary": "An admirer of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Sanae Takaichi is a protege of the ultra-conservative vision of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.",
    "story": [
      "Japan's governing party on Saturday elected former Economic Security Minister Sanae Takaichi, a hard-line ultra-conservative and China hawk, as its new leader, making her likely to become the country's first female prime minister.",
      "In a country that ranks poorly internationally for gender equality, the 64-year-old Takaichi makes history as the first female leader of Japan's long-governing conservative Liberal Democratic Party. Takaichi is one of the most conservative members of the male-dominated party.",
      "An admirer of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Takaichi is a protege of former Japanese Prime Minister\u00a0Shinzo Abe's ultra-conservative vision and a regular at the Yasukuni Shrine, seen as a symbol of Japan's wartime militarism, which could complicate Tokyo's relations with its Asian neighbors.",
      "Takaichi beat Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, the son of popular former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, in a runoff in a vote by the LDP on Saturday.",
      "Takaichi replaces Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba as the party hopes to regain public support and stay in power after major election losses.",
      "She is likely to be Japan's next prime minister because the party remains by far the largest in the lower house, which determines the national leader, and because opposition groups are highly splintered.",
      "Takaichi hopes to strengthen U.S.-Japan alliance",
      "Takaichi later said she will immediately work on stemming rising prices, while also focusing on diplomatic and security challenges.",
      "A parliamentary vote is expected in mid-October. The LDP, which has been criticized by opposition leaders for creating a prolonged political vacuum, said Takaichi needs to hurry because the winner will soon face a diplomatic test: a possible summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, who could demand that Japan increase its defense spending.",
      "A meeting is reportedly being planned for late October. Trump will travel to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea starting Oct. 31.",
      "Takaichi said ensuring the Japan-U.S. alliance is her top diplomatic priority.",
      "\"It is essential to ... confirm the reinforcement of the Japan-U.S. alliance,\" she said. Takaichi stressed the importance of their cooperation through three-way frameworks that also include regional partners such as South Korea, Australia and the Philippines, pledging Japan's greater role in achieving a free and open Indo-Pacific.",
      "She said she respects all tariffs and investment agreements struck between Tokyo and Washington under the Ishiba government.",
      "Takaichi tackling domestic challenges",
      "The LDP, whose consecutive losses in parliamentary elections in the past year have left it in the minority in both houses, needs its new leader to quickly bring back voter confidence and stability and to address challenges in and outside Japan. Takaichi will also need cooperation from key opposition groups to implement her party's policies.",
      "Ishiba, who achieved a 15% tariff deal with Washington and put Japan's ties with South Korea and other Asian countries on track during his one-year stint, said \"I hope the LDP will band together under new (party) president Takaichi to serve for the country and the people, as well as the world and for the new era.\"",
      "Ishiba, a centrist known as archrival of Abe, was virtually forced into resigning by ultra-conservative wings in the party.",
      "5 candidates for the job",
      "Five candidates, two currently serving and three former ministers, vied for the LDP presidency.",
      "Saturday's vote only involved 295 LDP parliamentarians and about 1 million dues-paying members. It only reflected 1% of the Japanese public.",
      "The LDP's choice of Takaichi, instead of the more centrist-to-liberal Koizumi, apparently underscores the party's hope to win back conservative voters who supported emerging far-right groups such as Sanseito in the July parliamentary election.",
      "But the LDP also needs help from the opposition, which it has long neglected. The party will likely look to expand its current coalition with the moderate centrist Komeito with at least one of the key opposition parties, which are more centrist.",
      "Takaichi supports fiscal spending for growth",
      "Takaichi, like other candidate,s called herself a \"moderate conservative\" during the run-up to the election to show their willingness to work with the opposition and stayed away from stressing her opposition to liberal social issues or anti-China policies.",
      "Takaichi on Saturday said the Yasukuni issue should not be a diplomatic issue and that she will think about how she can \"pay respect to the war dead and pray for peace.\"",
      "She supports bigger fiscal spending for growth, a stronger military and cybersecurity, as well as tougher regulations on increasing foreign tourists and laborers. She was criticized for citing unconfirmed reports to slam foreigners for kicking deer in Nara, her hometown, and saying many foreign law offenders escaped indictments due to a shortage of translators.",
      "Experts say candidates avoided discussing their usual political views on historical issues, same-sex marriage and other contentious topics, including the party's political funds scandal, which was the biggest reason for their election losses, and anti-corruption measures. Their avoidance of these subjects raised doubts over the party's ability to regain public trust, analysts said.",

      "Jihad Al-Shamie, 35, was shot dead by police on Thursday outside the Heaton Park Congregation Synagogue in Manchester after he rammed a car into pedestrians, attacked them with a knife and tried to force his way into the building.",
      "Three men and three women, aged between 18 and their 60s, were arrested in the greater Manchester area on suspicion of the \"commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism,\" as police work to determine whether the attacker acted alone.",
      "Congregation members Melvin Cravitz, 66, and Adrian Daulby, 53, died in the attack on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish year. Police say Daulby was accidentally shot by an armed officer as he and other congregants barricaded the synagogue to block Al-Shamie from entering. Three other men are hospitalized with serious injuries.",
      "Detectives say Al-Shamie, a British citizen of Syrian origin who lived in Manchester, may have been influenced by \"extreme Islamist ideology.\" He wore what appeared to be an explosives belt, which was found to be fake.",
      "Police said Al-Shamie was out on bail over an alleged rape at the time of the attack but had not been charged.",
      "The attack has devastated Britain's Jewish community and intensified debate about the line between criticism of Israel and antisemitism.",

      "Some politicians and religious leaders claimed pro-Palestinian demonstrations, which have been held regularly since the war in Gaza began, had played a role in spreading hatred of Jews. The protests have been overwhelmingly peaceful but some say chants such as \"From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free\" incite anti-Jewish hatred.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his supporters have frequently accused critics of Israel for its conduct of the war of antisemitism. Critics see it as an attempt to stifle even legitimate criticism.",
      "Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, the head of Orthodox Judaism in Britain, said the attack was the result of \"an unrelenting wave of Jew hatred\" on the streets and online.",
      "Some also say the U.K.'s recognition of a Palestinian state last month has emboldened antisemitism \u2014 a claim the government rejects. Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy was interrupted by boos and shouts of \"Shame on you\" on Friday as he addressed a vigil for victims of the attack in Manchester.",

    "summary": "No one was hurt when two vessels that were part of a flotilla bound for Gaza mysteriously caught fire last month.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directly approved military operations on two vessels early last month that were part of a Gaza-bound flotilla carrying aid and pro-Palestinian supporters, including Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, CBS News has learned.",
      "Two American intelligence officials briefed on the matter told CBS News that Israeli forces on Sept. 8 and 9 launched drones from a submarine and dropped incendiary devices onto the boats that were moored outside the Tunisian port of Sidi Bou Said, causing a fire. The officials spoke under the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on national security matters.",
      "Under international humanitarian law and the law of armed conflict, the use of incendiary weapons against a civilian population or civilian objects is prohibited in all circumstances.",
      "Israel has enforced a naval blockade of the Gaza Strip for more than a decade, first declaring the restriction in January 2009, when its navy announced the closure of the coastal waters to all maritime traffic. The move came some two years after Hamas took control of the region following a brief but violent civil war with the rival Fatah party, the political and military organization of Arab Palestinians, officially known as the Palestinian National Liberation Movement.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces didn't respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "The Global Sumud Flotilla organized the international maritime initiative that aims to break through Israel's naval blockade of Gaza and provide aid to the war-torn territory.",
      "On Sept. 8, an incendiary device was dropped onto the Family, a Portuguese-flagged vessel. The Global Sumud Flotilla told CBS News that on the night prior to the attack, Portuguese lawmaker Mariana Mort\u00e1gua was on board. The activists believe the perpetrators deliberately waited until \"elected officials or high-profile figures were absent,\" the group said in a statement to CBS News on Friday.",
      "On Sept. 9, the Alma, a British-flagged vessel, was attacked in a similar manner as the Family. In both cases, the group said last month that the boats were damaged by the fire but the crew was able to extinguish the flames quickly. No one was killed or injured.",
      "\"Confirmation of Israeli involvement would not surprise us; it would simply lay bare a pattern of arrogance and impunity so grotesque that it cannot escape eventual reckoning,\" the Global Sumud Flotilla said in its statement Friday.",
      "The statement added: \"Whether the purpose of these attacks was to kill us, scare us away, or disable our boats, they recklessly endangered civilians and humanitarian volunteers. The world must take note: attempts to silence, intimidate, or obstruct our commitment to the Palestinian cause and people will not succeed. We call for urgent, independent investigations into these attacks and full accountability for those responsible.\"",
      "In September, Tunisian authorities disputed that drones dropping incendiary devices caused the fire, instead claiming that an initial inspection indicated the explosion originated inside the boat, according to BBC News. Pro-Israeli accounts on social media claimed the fires were started after the activists did not use a flare gun properly.",
      "Footage released by the Global Sumud Flotilla and obtained by CBS News appears to show a ball of flames falling onto the boat, sparking the fire on board, instead of the fire originating from inside the vessel. The stationary cameras affixed to the vessels do not capture where the flames originated from prior to landing on the boat nor do they depict a flare gun being fired.",
      "In separate incidents in late September, the activist group said they were attacked by 15 low-altitude drones while sailing south of Greece. The Global Sumud Flotilla said at least 13 explosions were heard on and around several flotilla boats and objects were dropped on at least 10 boats, causing damage. While no casualties were reported, the activist group said that their communications systems were also disrupted.",
      "This week, Israeli naval forces intercepted most of the vessels bound for Gaza, detaining dozens of activists along with Thunberg and several European lawmakers, a move that drew swift international criticism.",
      "American citizens travelling on the flotilla have also been detained by Israel. A State Department official told CBS News that the department was monitoring the situation and is committed to providing assistance to U.S. citizens. The official also called the flotilla a \"deliberate and unnecessary provocation,\" particularly as the Trump administration continues to seek a negotiated solution to end the war in Gaza.",
      "Two Americans sailing with the Global Sumud Flotilla include Marine Corps veteran Jessica Clotfelter and Greg Stoker, organizer of the veterans' delegation to the group. On Wednesday, they spoke via Zoom to CBS News Chicago roughly an hour before the Israeli navy intercepted the flotilla.",
      "\"We are a civilian aid mission, trying to break the siege into Gaza, and we are carrying humanitarian aid in accordance with international humanitarian and maritime law,\" said Stoker.",
      "Clotfelter told CBS News Chicago that the images that have been coming out of Gaza for the last two years have been \"heartbreaking\" and \"gut-wreching.\"",
      "She added: \"I mean, I've cried probably every single day on this boat as the violence since we've taken off on 31 August has escalated.\"",

For the past seven years, Mullally has served as the bishop of London, where she was also the first woman to hold that position. She had previously been the most senior U.K. government adviser on nursing as the government's chief nursing officer for England, and was the youngest person ever to be appointed to that post.",
      "King Charles III \u2014 who is the supreme governor of the Church of England, a largely symbolic role that dates back to the church's foundation under King Henry VIII \u2014 congratulated Mullally on the appointment Friday.",
      "\"His Majesty congratulates Bishop Sarah on her appointment as archbishop-designate, a role which is of such importance in the UK and across the global Anglican Communion,\" a palace spokesperson told CBS News' partners at BBC News.",
      "In a statement Friday, Mullally said that she \"looks forward to sharing this journey of faith with the millions of people serving God and their communities in parishes all over the country and across the global Anglican Communion.\"",
      "\"At every stage of that journey, through my nursing career and Christian ministry, I have learned to listen deeply \u2013 to people and to God's gentle prompting \u2013 to seek to bring people together to find hope and healing,\" she said.",
      "The Anglican church, which Mullally will soon lead, has been mired in controversy over the past year. Her predecessor Justin Welby resigned last November after a review found that he and other senior church leaders had covered up the sexual and physical abuse of over 100 boys and young men in the United Kingdom and other countries by a British lawyer who helped lead Christian summer camps in multiple countries.",
      "Welby was not accused of committing any abuse himself, but an independent report found that leadership at the highest levels, including Welby, had known about the abuse.",

Two Jewish men, identified by police as Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz, were killed and three others were seriously wounded during the attack, which happened on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish religious calendar.",
      "Both of the victims were local residents.",

      "\"It is currently believed that the suspect, Jihad Al Shamie, was not in possession of a firearm,\" Watson said. \"It follows therefore, that subject to further forensic examination, this injury may sadly have been sustained as a tragic and unforeseen consequence of the urgently required action taken by my officers to bring this vicious attack to an end.\"",
      "\"We have also been advised by medical professionals that one of the three victims currently receiving treatment in hospital, has also suffered a gunshot wound, which is mercifully not life threatening,\" Watson added.",
      "Police officers shot and killed the suspect, who investigators believed to be 35-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie, a British citizen of Syrian descent, following a vehicle and stabbing attack outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue on Thursday morning.",
      "Officers were called to the synagogue at about 9.30 a.m. local time (4:30 a.m. ET) by a member of the public who said he'd seen a car being driven toward members of the public.",
      "The police said Thursday that the attacker drove directly at people outside the synagogue and then attacked people with a knife. The attack happened while a large group of worshippers was inside the synagogue, but the suspect did not manage to enter the building.",
      "In his statement on Friday, Watson said the only shots fired during the incident were fired by police \"as they worked to prevent the offender from entering the synagogue and causing further harm to our Jewish community.\"",
      "The attacker wore a vest that looked like it could contain explosives, but police later confirmed that there were no viable explosives found.",
      "The police said Thursday night that three other individuals had been arrested \"on suspicion of commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism\" in connection with the attack, whom the force identified only as \"two men in their 30s and a woman in her 60s.\"",
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer visited the scene of the attack Friday with his wife, speaking with police and other officials outside the synagogue.",

      "A spokesperson for the German airline Lufthansa told CBS News on Friday that flight operations \"resumed as scheduled early in the morning,\" adding that Lufthansa regretted any inconvenience to passengers.",
      "Munich airport said Friday that the flight disruptions had impacted nearly 3,000 passengers, but that those affected had been rebooked on new flights or had their flights rescheduled.",

      "After repeated incursions into Danish airspace, including around military bases and airports in recent weeks, European leaders met in Copenhagen earlier this week to discuss boosting European air defenses. The summit also came after Russian military aircraft violated NATO airspace in Poland, Romania\u00a0and Estonia\u00a0in recent weeks, and amid Russia's ongoing full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",

And if we're right, we'll in fact identify the lost Electra. We could be wrong but I think the evidence is very, very strong that this is, in fact what it is.''",
      "However, Ric Gillespie, executive director of the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery, has expressed skepticism. \"We've looked there in that spot, and there's nothing there,\" he told NBC News in July.",
      "Steve Schultz, a Purdue senior vice president and the university's general counsel, will be a field assistant on the expedition. He said that if the object is identified as Earhart's plane, the university hopes it can transport the plane home. Earhart worked at Purdue University for two years in the 1930s, and the Purdue Research Foundation originally paid for the airplane that Earhart flew, the school said. She planned to return the craft to the university after her trip around the world.",
      "\"A successful identification would be the first step toward fulfilling Amelia's original plan to return the Electra to West Lafayette after her historic flight,\" Schultz said in the news release.",
      "Last year, an expedition team captured a sonar image in the Pacific Ocean that appeared to resemble Earhart's plane resting at the bottom of the sea. It turned out\u00a0 to be a rock formation.",

      "Colombia has handed over a chunk of deceased drug lord Pablo Escobar's ranch, famous for its \"cocaine hippos,\"\u00a0to women caught up in the country's armed conflict, President Gustavo Petro said Wednesday.",
      "Escobar, once head of the powerful Medellin Cartel, was one of the richest men on the planet in the late 1980s, with Forbes magazine estimating his fortune at $25 billion.",
      "His lavish 10,000-acre Hacienda Napoles estate in northwest Antioquia department, which he filled with exotic animals, including hippos, became a symbol of his power and wealth.",
      "After he was shot dead by police in 1993, the state took over the estate and leased it to local authorities, who turned it into a successful theme park, complete with a hotel and zoo.",
      "Petro said that part of the estate had now been handed over to victims of Colombia's more-than-six-decade armed conflict between left-wing guerrillas, drug cartels, right-wing paramilitaries and the state.",
      "\"We have begun to recover the Napoles estate for the victims,\" Petro wrote on X, adding that Escobar's \"political and economic heirs wanted to take over the estate.\"",
      "The government said that 297 acres of land had been given to local women farmers.",
      "The women received a loan of the land from the local Puerto Triunfo municipality in 2017, but according to the national government, were later evicted by the police.",
      "\"I feel very happy because today there are women who have hope, who have land for life,\" Millinery Correa, one of the beneficiaries, said in a video shared by the state-run National Land Agency.",
      "Land ownership has been a key driver of Colombia's conflict.",
      "In May, Petro had asked that Escobar's estate be included in a land reform program, under which thousands of hectares of land, including some properties previously owned by drug traffickers, be given to rural Colombians.",
      "Tourism companies operating at Hacienda Napoles had protested the plan to break up the estate, pointing to its role in attracting tourists to the region.",
      "Hacienda Napoles is famous for the replica plane that he mounted over the entrance gate \u2014 an emblem, since removed, of the planeloads of drugs he smuggled into the United States \u2014 as well as its hippo population.",
      "Escobar brought a small number of the African beasts to Colombia in the late 1980s.",
      "After his death the animals were left to roam freely beyond the estate's boundaries and to multiply. They now number around 150.",
      "Colombia has declared them an invasive species and experts previously said sterilization alone is not enough to control the growth of the invasive species, which is why the government is arranging for the possible\u00a0transfer of hippos\u00a0to overseas sanctuaries. But the cost of deporting the hippos is also expensive \u2014 an estimated\u00a0$3.5 million.",
      "The area where they roam is a paradise for the animals who have no predators and ample food and water, CBS News correspondent Manuel Bojorquez\u00a0reported in 2019. But they're getting too close to people. It's not uncommon to spot a three-ton hippo walking around town.",

      "\"I feel like music has always just been my boyfriend. So, whenever I have a boyfriend, it's always like, 'Oh, you're just temporary,'\" she told People. \"But when I do go through a breakup, I don't go to the bar. I put my guitar in my hands.\"",

      "Kurt the CyberGuy reports on how Instagram safety tools are not 'foolproof' for kids, shares tips for how to protect teens online and more on 'Fox & Friends.'",
      "Meta is rolling out new protections aimed at making social media safer for young people. In September 2024, Instagram introduced Teen Accounts, which come with built-in safeguards that limit who can contact teens, what content they see and how long they spend on the app.",
      "Since then, adoption has been strong: 97% of teens ages 13-15 kept the default settings, and 94% of parents say Teen Accounts are helpful. Now, Meta is expanding those protections beyond Instagram. Teen Accounts are coming to Facebook and Messenger worldwide, bringing stronger safety standards to more of the apps teens use every day.",

      "Critics and researchers question Meta's teen safety tools",
      "However, not everyone agrees that these protections go far enough.\u00a0Research regarding the effectiveness of Instagram's teen safety features, as reported by child-safety advocacy groups and corroborated by researchers at Northeastern University (Sept. 25, 2025), paints a different picture. The study found that only eight of 47 safety features tested were fully effective, and internal documents suggest that Meta was aware of some shortcomings. Critics also argued that certain protections, like manual comment-hiding, place the burden on teens themselves rather than preventing harm upfront. They questioned whether time management tools were robust enough, giving some features middling grades despite functioning as described.",
      "\"Misleading and dangerously speculative reports such as this one undermine the important conversation about teen safety,\" Meta told CyberGuy, \"This report repeatedly misrepresents our efforts to empower parents and protect teens, misstating how our safety tools work and how millions of parents and teens are using them today.",
      "\"Teen Accounts lead the industry because they provide automatic safety protections and straightforward parental controls. The reality is teens who were placed into these protections saw less sensitive content, experienced less unwanted contact and spent less time on Instagram at night. Parents also have robust tools at their fingertips, from limiting usage to monitoring interactions. We'll continue improving our tools, and we welcome constructive feedback.

      "The program has already reached hundreds of thousands of students, with a goal of teaching one million middle school students in the coming year.

For educators, the School Partnership Program provides a direct connection to Meta, ensuring reports of unsafe behavior get attention quickly. Students benefit too, with a curriculum designed to give them practical tools for navigating online life safely.",
      "At the same time, the pushback from critics highlights that there is still debate about whether these safeguards go far enough. While Meta insists its tools work as intended, watchdogs argue that protecting teens online requires even stronger measures.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Meta's expansion of Teen Accounts marks a major shift in how social platforms approach safety. By adding built-in protections, the company reduces risks for teens without requiring parents to manage every setting. At the same time, the School Partnership Program gives educators new tools to protect students in real time. The online safety curriculum goes one step further by teaching kids how to recognize threats and respond confidently. Still, advocacy groups and independent researchers question whether these efforts are enough, and Meta's strong defense shows just how high the stakes are in the teen safety debate. As teens spend more of their lives online, the responsibility to protect them grows. The real test will be how well these tools hold up against evolving online threats.",

      "How the FileFix attack works",
      "As reported by researchers at Acronis,\u00a0a leading cybersecurity and data protection company, the attack begins with a phishing page that looks like a message from Meta's support team, claiming that your account will be disabled in seven days unless you view an \"incident report.\" Instead of providing an actual document, the page disguises a malicious PowerShell command as a file path.",
      "Victims are instructed to copy it, open File Explorer, and paste it into the address bar. While it appears harmless, this action secretly runs code that starts the malware infection process.",
      "This method is part of a family of attacks known as ClickFix, where people are tricked into pasting commands into system dialogs. FileFix, created by Red Team researcher mr.d0x, builds on that idea by exploiting the File Explorer address bar instead. In this campaign, the attackers improved the trick by hiding the malicious command behind long strings of spaces, so only the fake file path is visible to the victim.",

      "FileFix sends out fake alerts urging users to review their account security. (Acronis)",

      "The malware delivered by this campaign is StealC, an infostealer that collects a wide range of personal and organizational data. It is designed to grab browser credentials and authentication cookies from Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and other browsers.",
      "It also targets messaging apps like Discord, Telegram and Pidgin, along with cryptocurrency wallets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Exodus. StealC goes further by attempting to compromise cloud accounts from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Azure, VPN services like ProtonVPN and even gaming accounts from Battle.net and Ubisoft. In addition, it can take screenshots of the victim's desktop, giving attackers a live view of sensitive activity.",
      "Acronis reported that the campaign has already appeared in several different versions over a short period, with changes in payloads and infrastructure. This suggests that the attackers are actively testing and refining their methods to avoid detection and improve success rates.",

      "5 ways you can protect yourself from FileFix attacks",
      "To stay protected against attacks like FileFix and prevent malware such as StealC from stealing sensitive information, you need to combine caution with practical security measures. The following steps can help safeguard accounts, devices, and personal data.",
      "Attackers rely on panic. Treat any message claiming your Meta account or other services will be disabled within days with caution. Verify the alert directly through official platforms rather than clicking links or following instructions from an email or web page.",
      "FileFix relies on convincing you to paste hidden PowerShell commands disguised as file paths. Never paste commands into system dialogs, File Explorer, or terminals unless you are absolutely certain of their origin.",
      "FileFix and StealC thrive on the information they can extract from a device or linked accounts. By using data removal services, you reduce the amount of sensitive personal information that can be found online or left exposed on old platforms. This minimizes what attackers can exploit if they manage to gain access.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "A strong antivirus software can detect malware like StealC before it fully executes. Many solutions now include behavior-based detection that can flag suspicious scripts or hidden downloads, helping catch threats even when attackers try to disguise commands as harmless actions.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

This is the sixth zero-day Chrome has faced this year, highlighting just how quickly attackers move to take advantage of these hidden weaknesses.",

      "Chrome users are urged to update immediately to block active zero-day attacks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "A critical flaw in Chrome's V8 engine",
      "The newly patched vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-10585, stems from a type confusion weakness in Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) discovered and reported the bug on Tuesday, and the company shipped a fix the following day, Bleeping Computer reported.",
      "Google confirmed that the flaw was being exploited in the wild, though it did not share technical details or name the groups behind the attacks. TAG has a history of uncovering zero-days tied to government-sponsored spyware campaigns aimed at high-risk individuals such as opposition leaders, journalists and dissidents.",
      "The fix was delivered through Chrome version 140.0.7339.185/.186 for Windows and macOS, and version 140.0.7339.185 for Linux. These updates will gradually reach all users in the Stable Desktop channel over the coming weeks.",
      "While Chrome typically updates automatically, you can apply the patch immediately by navigating to the \u2018About Google Chrome\u2019 section.

      "This marks the sixth zero-day flaw patched in Chrome this year. In March, Google addressed CVE-2025-2783, a sandbox escape bug exploited in espionage attacks against Russian organizations. In May, it pushed emergency updates for CVE-2025-4664, which let attackers hijack user accounts.",
      "Then in June, another flaw in the V8 engine, CVE-2025-5419, was patched after being spotted by TAG. July saw the release of a fix for CVE-2025-6558, which allowed attackers to bypass Chrome's sandbox protection.

      "Many zero-day attacks are delivered through malicious websites or email attachments. Avoid clicking unknown links or downloading files from unverified sources, especially if they prompt you to disable security settings. Also, use strong antivirus software to add another layer of defense to detect malicious code that tries to run through compromised browsers. A strong antivirus can spot suspicious activity before it takes hold. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Even if attackers manage to steal your login details through a browser exploit,\u00a02FA makes it much harder for them to break into your accounts. Use an authenticator app instead of SMS when possible for stronger protection.",
      "If attackers exploit the browser to steal login data, a password manager keeps your credentials safe and helps generate unique, complex passwords. Even if one account is targeted, it prevents a domino effect across your logins.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords",
      "Some extensions can be abused to make attacks worse. Stick to extensions from trusted developers, review permissions carefully and uninstall anything you no longer need.",
      "Chrome updates are critical, but attackers can also exploit holes in Windows, macOS, Android or iOS. Regular OS updates patch vulnerabilities across the system, reducing the chances of a browser exploit spreading further.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The fact that Chrome has already faced six zero-day attacks this year shows how relentless attackers are and how even the most popular software can have serious gaps. These flaws are not just bugs, but opportunities for hackers to exploit millions of users before fixes roll out. The pattern also highlights the growing sophistication of threat actors, including state-backed groups targeting high-risk individuals. No browser is completely safe, and the battle to secure widely used software is ongoing and far from over.",

      "Drone deliveries are moving from futuristic concepts to everyday life. Companies like\u00a0Google-owned Wing\u00a0and\u00a0Zipline\u00a0already partner with Walmart, DoorDash and even hospitals to deliver goods and medical supplies. Amazon is also testing its Prime Air drones to shorten delivery times.",
      "Flytrex, based in Tel Aviv, Israel, has already logged more than 200,000 successful deliveries across the U.S. Its drones are FAA-certified to fly beyond visual line of sight, giving them the ability to scale delivery services while meeting strict safety standards.",

      "What this means for you",
      "For customers, this could mean receiving meals, snacks or essentials in just minutes, instead of waiting half an hour or more. Drone delivery also has the potential to reduce traffic congestion, cut emissions and lower costs compared to traditional courier services.",
      "The catch? Availability will be limited at first, likely in suburban test markets where air traffic is easier to manage. But if all goes well, Uber Eats could expand drone deliveries to more cities in the coming years.",

      "ChatGPT could soon alert police when teens discuss suicide. OpenAI CEO and co-founder Sam Altman revealed the change during a recent interview. ChatGPT, the widely used artificial intelligence chatbot that can answer questions and hold conversations, has become a daily tool for millions. His comments mark a major shift in how the AI company may handle mental health crises.",

      "Until now, ChatGPT's response to suicidal thoughts has been to suggest hotlines. This new policy signals a move from passive suggestions to active intervention.",

      "Teens can easily access ChatGPT on a mobile device. (Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Tragedies that prompted action",
      "The shift follows lawsuits tied to teen suicides. The most high-profile case involves 16-year-old Adam Raine of California. His family alleges ChatGPT provided a \"step-by-step playbook\" for suicide, including instructions for tying a noose and even drafting a goodbye note.",
      "After Raine's death in April, his parents sued OpenAI. They argued that the company failed to stop its AI from guiding their son toward harm.",

      "Adam Raine, a California teen, took his life in April 2025 amid claims ChatGPT coached him (Raine Family)",
      "How widespread is the problem?",
      "Altman pointed to global numbers to justify stronger measures. He noted that about 15,000 people take their own lives each week worldwide. With 10% of the world using ChatGPT, he estimated that around 1,500 suicidal individuals may interact with the chatbot weekly.",

Your email provider can use them to refine their spam detection algorithms. The best course of action is to report them, so providers can develop better ways to identify harmful or unwanted messages.

    "story": [
      "Fox News anchor Bret Baier explores how the technology is changing how the world operates on 'Special Report.'",
      "A New Jersey school district has adopted artificial intelligence to help detect weapons and stop threats before they escalate. The Glassboro Public School District is the first in the country to deploy a combined ZeroEyes and Singlewire InformaCast system for AI gun detection and mass communication.",
      "This integration speeds up emergency responses and reduces the time it takes to notify law enforcement.",

      "NORTH KOREAN HACKERS USE AI TO FORGE MILITARY IDS",
      "What's new in school security",
      "The district is using ZeroEyes, an AI video analytics platform that integrates with existing security cameras. The software scans for visible firearms and sends an alert whenever a potential threat appears. A team of military and law enforcement veterans at a 24/7 operations center then reviews the image to confirm whether the gun is real. Once verified, the system pushes an alert to school staff and police within three to five seconds. At the same time, buildings go into lockdown automatically.",
      "South Jersey schools have deployed AI to spot weapons and alert police in seconds. (Jay Janner/The Austin American-Statesman via Getty Images)",
      "These alerts are distributed through Singlewire Software's InformaCast platform. This system can send warnings across school PA systems, strobe lights, digital signs, desk phones and other communication tools. Together, the two technologies give law enforcement and educators a faster and more coordinated way to respond to potential dangers.",
      "How the system works",
      "Security cameras around each building feed video into the ZeroEyes software. When the AI detects what appears to be a firearm, it highlights the object and immediately shares the footage with human analysts. If those experts confirm that the weapon is real, they send the alert to the district and local authorities. InformaCast then pushes the message to every connected device, allowing staff and students to receive instructions within seconds. The goal is to shorten the time between detection and action so schools can respond before violence has a chance to unfold.",
      "Concerns to consider",
      "As with any new technology, questions remain. Even with human oversight, AI can make mistakes, and false alerts are always a possibility. Privacy also comes into play since the system depends on constant monitoring through security cameras. Cost is another factor because installing, maintaining and training staff for these systems requires significant funding. Finally, schools need to build community trust by explaining how the technology works and preparing students and parents for what to expect during drills or emergencies.",
      "SCAMMERS ARE ABUSING ICLOUD CALENDAR TO SEND PHISHING EMAILS",
      "Glassboro district becomes first in U.S. to pair AI gun detection with mass alerts. (Lori Van Buren/Albany Times Union via Getty Images)",
      "What this means for you",
      "For parents, teachers and students, this technology represents an important shift in how schools approach safety. AI adds speed to the process by recognizing threats before most people would even notice them. Alerts reach law enforcement and staff almost immediately, creating a critical advantage in a crisis. The system also provides a layered approach to protection by combining cameras, AI and communication tools. Parents may also find reassurance in knowing that human experts verify each threat to help reduce false alarms. While no system is perfect, this integration builds confidence that schools are investing in stronger defenses.",

      "When you search Google for apps, it feels natural to trust the first results you see. They're supposed to be the most reliable, right? Unfortunately, hackers know this too. They're sneaking fake websites into search results that look just like the real thing. If you click and download from one of these sites, you could end up with malware instead of the app you wanted. In other words, the top search results aren't always safe, and that's exactly how scammers trick people.",

      "What you need to know about malware in Google searches",
      "Researchers at FortiGuard Labs found that attackers are setting up websites that look almost identical to trusted providers. These sites host installers for apps like Signal, WhatsApp, Deepl, Chrome, Telegram, Line, VPN services and WPS Office. The catch is that these downloads include both the real app and hidden malware.",
      "Once you run one, the malware drops files into your system, asks for administrator access and quietly starts spying. It can collect personal information, log everything you type, monitor your screen and even disable your antivirus.",
      "Hackers are planting fake apps in Google search results and they look just like the real thing. (Harun Ozalp /Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "Some versions were designed to snoop on Telegram messages. All of this is possible because hackers use a tactic called SEO poisoning, which manipulates Google's search results so their fake websites appear near the top. Even if you stick to \"safe-looking\" search links, you could still land on a fraudulent page.",
      "How hackers disguise fake apps as real ones",
      "So how do these fake sites end up in your search results in the first place? The attackers use a technique called SEO poisoning. They register lookalike domains, use plugins to game search algorithms and then climb up Google's rankings. That way, when you search for a trusted app, the fake site may appear as one of the first results.",
      "According to FortiGuard Labs, this particular campaign mainly targeted Chinese-speaking users, but the method is being used everywhere. In fact, earlier reports from Cisco Talos showed ransomware groups pushing fake downloads of AI tools like ChatGPT or InVideo. Others used spoofed sites for PayPal, Microsoft, Netflix and Apple. Sometimes, attackers even buy sponsored ads so that their malicious links appear right at the top.",
      "The scary part is that you might not even realize you installed something dangerous. Because the fake installer includes the real app, everything seems to work fine. Meanwhile, the hidden malware is already active on your device. That makes it harder to detect and much easier for attackers to steal your data.",

      "Before clicking \"download,\" carefully inspect the domain name. Hackers often create lookalike domains that look nearly identical to real ones, adding small spelling changes or extra words. Even small differences can indicate a fake site designed to deliver malware.",

      "\"The rise of open and violent anti-Semitism in America is more recent than in much of Europe, but perhaps all the more worrying because of that,\" Ruhe said. \"Part of the solution is colleges shutting down far-left campus \u2018protests\u2019 that intend only to intimidate Jews and anyone who calls for policies short of ending Israel's existence.",

      "But Israeli attacks on the enclave have continued, and the Israel Defense Forces said Saturday they continued to surround Gaza City, and that \u201cattempting to return to it poses a significant risk.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe area north of Wadi Gaza is still considered a dangerous combat zone,\u201d Avichay Adraee, the IDF\u2019s Arabic-language spokesman, said in a post on X, referring to a river valley that is considered an informal divider between the northern and southern halves of Gaza.",
      "Israeli strikes killed at least 66 people and injured over 250 in the past 24 hours, Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health said Saturday, adding that the total death toll in the enclave had passed 67,000 after the addition of more than 700 people whose data had been verified.",
      "Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which is part of the Hamas-run government, does not say how many of those killed were civilians versus combatants, but the United Nations and other independent experts consider its figures to be reliable.",
      "It was unclear how many of the most recent deaths took place after Trump\u2019s announcement.",

      "Tuesday marks the second anniversary of the start of the Israel-Hamas war, which began on Oct. 7, 2023, with the Hamas-led terrorist attacks on Israel in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 abducted.",
      "Of the 48 hostages remaining in Gaza, Israel believes 20 are still alive. Under the plan proposed by Trump, Hamas would have three days to release them."

    "story": [
      "Former President Barack Obama has stepped up his criticisms of the Trump administration in recent weeks, weighing in more forcefully and frequently than he did at the start of the president\u2019s second term.",
      "It is an intensification that Democrats welcome at a moment when they lack party leadership, even as some say his trademark caution is still getting the better of him.",
      "In the last three weeks, Obama called President Donald Trump\u2019s news conference linking Tylenol and autism \u201cviolence against the truth,\u201d and he attacked the administration in the wake of comedian Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s initial late-night ouster for taking \u201ccancel culture\u201d to a \u201cnew and dangerous level.\u201d After Charlie Kirk\u2019s killing, Obama aggressively called out Trump\u2019s rhetoric, saying the president was further dividing the country. And before the government shutdown, he clapped at Republicans, saying they would \u201crather shut down the government than help millions of Americans afford health care.\u201d",
      "Obama\u2019s headline-grabbing comments come after private conversations over the summer with allies about whether he should speak out more and how he should approach high-stakes White House actions as they unfold, according to two people familiar with the discussions. According to one of the sources, the former president recognizes the gravity of a moment when Trump is seen as stretching the limits of the Constitution, and one former aide said he is cognizant that there is a dearth of party leadership.",
      "It\u2019s unclear, however, whether Obama will sustain this pace.",
      "A former Obama White House official with knowledge of his team\u2019s thinking said before Obama sat for a series of paid speaking events in recent weeks, his team mulled how to best take advantage of the appearances. At the same time, a flurry of high-profile events transpired, including the Kirk shooting, Kimmel being pulled off the air and the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m aware there are discussions of \u2018Should we be out there more? How are we calibrating?\u2019 Of course they\u2019re asking that, that\u2019s responsible because he\u2019s trying to be thoughtful. It\u2019s fair to say they\u2019re constantly asking themselves, \u2018How do we meet this moment?\u2019\u201d the former official said.",
      "But that person noted that some of Obama\u2019s newsmaking moments emerged from public appearances that had been on the books for months.",
      "\u201cTo take that shot is intentional,\u201d the person said of Obama\u2019s rhetoric against Trump. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 that is definitely a choice. But I can\u2019t overstate the extent to which the realities of the opportunities you have on the calendar inputs into your strategy. They reinforce each other.\u201d",
      "Obama\u2019s role in the country\u2019s current political discourse has been a topic of conversation \u2014 and at times a source of deep frustration \u2014 among Democrats since he left office more than eight years ago. While it\u2019s still not enough for some, his cadence in recent weeks is a sharp change from Trump\u2019s first term, when he subscribed to post-presidential norms of not talking about a successor.",
      "But this time is arguably unlike any other. Eight months into Trump\u2019s presidency, the Democratic Party remains leaderless, creating a void that Obama is best suited to fill.",
      "\u201cThe party itself is in the wilderness and I think the last person who can speak with credibility on behalf of Democrats is Obama,\u201d said Ami Copeland, a Democratic strategist who previously served as Obama\u2019s deputy national finance director. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to hear from Biden about anything right now. [Bill] Clinton is still kind of tainted, I think. And the last person who really led a successful campaign that moves the big-tent party is him.\u201d",
      "Copeland characterized Obama\u2019s recent public statements as likely coming from a sense of duty.",
      "\u201cHe still feels a responsibility to not just the party, but more importantly, to the country. I don\u2019t even see that as a partisan comment. That is just [an] \u2018I care about the country and babies\u2019 comment,\u201d Copeland said, referencing Obama\u2019s retort on Tylenol.",
      "In response to a request for comment on Obama\u2019s recent remarks, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said, \u201cBarack Hussein Obama is the architect of modern political division in America \u2014 famously demeaning millions of patriotic Americans who opposed his liberal agenda as \u2018bitter\u2019 for \u2018cling[ing] to guns or religion.\u2019\u201d",
      "\"If he cares about unity in America, he would tell his own party to stop their destructive behavior,\u201d she added.",
      "Even as many Democrats point to Obama\u2019s impact, they acknowledge they need to look beyond him if they\u2019re ever to move forward with a new generation of leadership.",
      "But for now, they point to Obama\u2019s popularity as giving his words more weight. A Gallup poll in February showed Obama had the highest approval rating among presidents who were still living. A Marquette University Law School poll released last week showed Trump with net minus-15% favorability while Obama enjoyed net 17% favorability.",
      "Obama\u2019s discussions on whether to weigh in more publicly on developments out of the Trump administration have included exploring ideas of how, when and in what format, according to the people familiar with the discussions. They characterized the approach as a work in progress, meaning he\u2019s made his views on Trump clear over the past decade, but as the administration rolls out new actions, he\u2019s sought to ensure his approach has an impact.",
      "This summer, the former president was called out for clinging to a reserved posture.",
      "In June, a headline in The Atlantic asked, \u201cWhere is Barack Obama?\u201d and thrashed the former president, casting him as all but sitting on his heels as democracy burned.",
      "\u201cNo matter how brazen Trump becomes, the most effective communicator in the Democratic Party continues to opt for minimal communication,\u201d the piece stated. \u201cHis \u2018audacity of hope\u2019 presidency has given way to the fierce lethargy of semi-retirement.\u201d",
      "Less than two weeks later, Obama made news at a public event where he warned that the United States was \u201cdangerously close\u201d to slipping into an autocracy. At the time, news pieces found it notable that Obama appeared publicly to speak against Trump at all. But even at that event, no audio or video was allowed, and Obama was cautious and circumspect. He did not mention Trump by name.",
      "\u201cDemocracy is not self-executing. It requires people, judges, people in the Justice Department, and people throughout the government who take an oath to uphold the Constitution,\u201d Obama said in those remarks. \u201cIt requires them to take that oath seriously. When that isn\u2019t happening, we start drifting into something that is not consistent with American democracy. It is consistent with autocracies.\u201d",
      "Aides have long said they want to avoid a \u201cdilution\u201d factor with the 44th president, so that he\u2019s not so frequently weighing in on issues that his words lose their impact.",
      "In July, Obama\u2019s office did issue a rebuke of Trump after the president accused him of committing \u201ctreason\u201d and rigging the 2016 and 2020 elections.",
      "\u201cBut these claims are outrageous enough to merit one. These bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction,\u201d his office said at the time.",
      "To some Democrats, Obama is falling short at a critical time.",
      "\u201cObama has a singular role in impacting the national debate that he is not in any way maxing out right now, at a time when he is most needed,\u201d said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.",
      "Green held up Obama\u2019s signaling of support for California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s effort to match Texas in redrawing its maps mid-decade as the kind of \u201ctrickle down\u201d messaging he should take part in to help guide other Democrats.",
      "\u201cHe has an unmatched ability to cut through the noise and focus in on the Republicans\u2019 most effective arguments, and then completely debunk them, oftentimes with humor that has been devastating for some Republican candidates on the receiving end during campaign season,\u201d Green said. \u201cBut we need him to use that same prowess in this moment to help save the country.\u201d",
      "As president in 2011, Obama showed no reticence in ripping into Trump for promoting the false claim that Obama had been born outside the U.S. At that year\u2019s White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner, Obama mercilessly mocked Trump, who was in the audience, for having little experience in making consequential executive decisions and for peddling conspiracy theories.",
      "\u201cNow, I know that he\u2019s taken some flak lately, but no one is happier, no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than the Donald,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter \u2014 like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?\u201d",
      "Trump was visibly irritated during the remarks, and some of his allies say the moment likely factored into his decision to seek the presidency in 2016.",
      "To be sure, Obama has for years served as a Trump critic, particularly when shifting to his familiar role as a closer in critical races on the campaign trail for other Democrats. He\u2019s trotted out punchy one-liners, including at the Democratic National Convention when he memorably needled Trump over an obsession with crowd size, then gestured with his hands in a way that made clear he also was referencing Trump\u2019s manhood.",
      "In August, it was Obama who acted as the party elder and congratulated Texas Democrats in a video address for standing up to Republicans by leaving their state to deny the GOP a quorum before a redistricting vote. Obama has kept up his advocacy for the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, led by his friend and former attorney general Eric Holder.",
      "\u201cPresident Obama has been sounding the alarm about the threat of gerrymandering for a long time. He was integral to the formation of the NDRC and has made our mission a priority in his post-presidency,\u201d NDRC President John Bisognano said in a statement.",
      "The recent recalibration of Obama\u2019s comments is in part due to the increasing pace and scale of Trump\u2019s actions, two former aides said.",
      "\u201cWhen I hear not just our current president, but his aides, who have a history of calling political opponents \u2018vermin,\u2019 enemies who need to be \u2018targeted,\u2019 that speaks to a broader problem that we have right now and something that we\u2019re going to have to grapple with, all of us,\u201d Obama said at a Sept. 17 public appearance before the Jefferson Educational Society, a nonprofit think tank.",
      "Before that, he stood out among Democrats for having called New York City mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani in June, even as many of his peers in the party tiptoed around the democratic socialist\u2019s primary win.",
      "\u201cHe picks and chooses his spots wisely. Sometimes you can watch for so long,\u201d a person who frequently speaks to the former president said. \u201cYou won\u2019t see him shadowing this president. He didn\u2019t do it the first four years. There was a lot of crazy then. More crazy now. He\u2019s not going to be a president who spends his time throwing shade on another president, but he\u2019ll certainly lean in when he sees injustices.\u201d",
      "While being interviewed onstage in London by British Nigerian historian David Olusoga, Obama last month described Trump\u2019s claims about the link between Tylenol and autism as \u201cviolence against the truth.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have the spectacle of my successor in the Oval Office, making broad claims around certain drugs and autism that have been continuously disproved. \u2026 That undermines public health, the degree to which that can do harm to women who are pregnant,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why, by the way, it is important for those who believe in the truth and believe in science to also examine truth when it is inconvenient for us.\u201d",
      "John Anzalone, who acted as a chief pollster to Obama as well as to Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and former President Joe Biden said Democrats are so far in the desert they\u2019re craving a dominant voice to step forward.",
      "\u201cMore Obama,\u201d Anzalone said, \u201cjust like \u2018more cowbell,\u2019\u201d referencing a famous \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d skit.",
      "Anzalone argued this moment is unlike others in history, as there is no major oppositional voice breaking through in the same way that then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich could act as a foil to President Bill Clinton when the Republicans were in the minority, for instance.",
      "If \u201che feels more comfortable ratcheting it up, you\u2019re going to see a lot of people cheering, because we feel that it\u2019s kind of leaderless and rudderless,\u201d Anzalone said of Obama. \u201cThere\u2019s an audience for President Obama and people do listen, but we also kind of understand that there\u2019s a certain calculus when you\u2019re a former president about what, how often and how loud you speak, and you\u2019ve got to respect that.\u201d",
      "Anzalone noted, however, that as much as Democrats want to hear from Obama early and often, new leaders need to emerge, and the party as a whole must find a way to break through to voters moving forward.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s good to hear from President Obama but there\u2019s limits to what even he can do fixing the problems of the terrible branding,\u201d Anzalone said. \u201cIndividual candidates are going to have to do that. Leaders are going to have to do that.\u201d"

      "The Department of Defense Education Activity, or DoDEA, which operates 161 schools on or near military bases worldwide, has halted all extracurricular activities, including sports, for more than 67,000 students.",
      "Dylan McDonald, a 17-year-old senior and co-captain of his soccer team at Kentucky\u2019s Fort Campbell Army base, fears he may have played the last game of his high school career after the government shutdown halted all extracurriculars. He and his mother worry that missing next week\u2019s district tournament, could hurt his chances of being recruited to play in college.",
      "\u201cI put countless hours and blood, sweat and tears into this, and to not be able to finish properly based off of something that is uncontrollable to myself and my teammates and our families, yet still so directly affects us, is truly devastating,\u201d Dylan said of the shutdown\u2019s impact.",
      "To further complicate matters, missing the tournament could also cost him a spot at this year\u2019s local all-district team, a roster of top players that he\u2019s been a part of the past two seasons.",
      "Dylan and his mother, Jennifer McDonald, are among the eight parents and students at DoDEA schools who told NBC News how the government shutdown is affecting them, describing cancellations of sports practices and games, as well as afterschool tutoring and student theater productions.",
      "Katie Fox, whose husband is a retired Marine, said her 15-year-old son\u2019s homecoming dance at the DoDEA-operated Stuttgart High School in Germany was supposed to be this weekend. They already paid for tickets, his outfit and provided donations to help support the event. Then, due to the shutdown, it was postponed to later this month \u2014 assuming a funding bill is passed by then.",
      "She said she\u2019s frustrated, because Congress could pass a targeted appropriations bill to allow for extracurricular activities to continue.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s my biggest frustration,\u201d she said. \u201cI know that there\u2019s a solution, but it\u2019s like we\u2019re not being heard.\u201d",
      "Fox added that student athletes at DoDEA schools abroad are especially affected when sports games are canceled, because, unlike in the U.S., they can only compete against other DoDEA schools, meaning there are typically fewer games overall.",
      "Maribel Jarzabek, whose husband is in the Air Force and based in Belgium, said her daughter Cassie, a junior at the DoDEA-operated SHAPE High School, only has six cross-country meets a year before the championship meet, compared to U.S. schools\u2019 cross-country teams, which have around eight to 10 meets before the championships.",
      "This means that Cassie, who is favored to win this year\u2019s DoDEA European championship in cross-country, her mom said, has fewer chances to impress college recruiters than students with longer seasons and more chances to compete.",
      "Cassie said she\u2019s afraid the championships, which are scheduled for later this month, could also be affected, which could be devastating for her because they are the most important for recruiters.",
      "\u201cAs a military kid, we already have to deal with the pressures of moving every couple years and starting completely fresh, not having any friends,\u201d Cassie said. \u201cSo this is just another thing added on to the adversity we already have to overcome. It just really hurts.\u201d",
      "Crystal Noga \u2014 whose son Aiden Ward is a senior and a co-captain of Fort Campbell High School\u2019s soccer team alongside Dylan McDonald \u2014 said that in the past, she has sent videos of her kids playing sports to their dad when he has been deployed overseas, and now some kids\u2019 parents could be deprived of that, too.",
      "She said if the team is forced to forfeit their first district game against their rivals next week, she won\u2019t have any other chances to see Aiden play soccer in high school.",
      "\u201cNot only is it taken from them, it\u2019s taken from me as a parent,\u201d Noga said. \u201cOnce he leaves high school, that\u2019s it. They\u2019re thrown into the real world. So you\u2019re taking away my last opportunity as well to see my kid be a kid.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, team captains like Dylan, Aiden and Cassie have to organize practices for their teams on their own, and they have to emphasize that they are not mandatory, their parents said. At the same time, most of their parents are living on the paycheck they received this week until the government passes a spending bill.",
      "As Democrats and Republicans in Congress blame each other for the shutdown, the parents who spoke with NBC News all shared a similar sentiment: They don\u2019t care which party is at fault \u2014 they want this fixed for their kids.",
      "\u201cIf you can\u2019t come to an agreement, putting the burden on other people\u2019s lives, whether it be their paycheck, whether it be sports, whether it be anything, is absolutely unjust,\u201d Noga said."

Shaheen was just one of two Democratic caucus members (along with Sen. Angus King, I-Maine) who voted for the last Republican bill to avoid a government shutdown, which passed in March.",
      "She\u2019s also the lead author of the Democratic bill to make permanent the Obamacare subsidies that will expire at the end of this year, the party\u2019s central demand in the current standoff. And she\u2019s retiring at the end of this term, freeing her from political pressure.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of people on both sides of the aisle who think we need to address this,\u201d Shaheen said of the Obamacare subsidies, citing recent polls that show substantial support for extending them to avoid premium hikes. \u201cI think it\u2019s important, and it\u2019s a message to not only our Republican colleagues, but to the White House.\u201d",
      "A source who has spoken to Shaheen said she recognizes the headwinds Democrats face as the minority party and has spoken to colleagues in search of the best possible outcomes on a health care solution. The source spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations among senators.",
      "Shaheen is seen by Republicans as someone they can deal with; she\u2019s nobody\u2019s idea of a partisan flamethrower. If there\u2019s a deal to break the logjam, it probably runs through her.",
      "Sen. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga.",
      "Ossoff is the only Democrat running for re-election next year in a state won by President Donald Trump in 2024. The first-term Georgia senator has held his cards close to the vest during the shutdown and has been strategic in his occasional breaks with his party during his Senate career. But in each of the four recent votes on bills to fund the government, he has supported the Democratic plan \u2014 which extends Obamacare funding and undoes Medicaid cuts \u2014 and opposed the Republican one.",
      "Ossoff said his vote is \u201cto keep the government open and to prevent massive increases to Georgians\u2019 health insurance premiums next year.\u201d",
      "He faulted Trump for telling Republicans not to negotiate with Democrats, while urging the GOP to \u201cwork with us to find a bipartisan path forward and to prevent a massive increase in health insurance premiums for Georgia families.\u201d",
      "For now, Trump and Republicans are shouldering more of the blame for the shutdown than Democrats, according to four recent polls. That gives Ossoff some breathing room. But he won\u2019t want to alienate swing voters who may prove crucial to his quest for a second term in an ultracompetitive state.",
      "If the public turns on Democrats in the shutdown fight, Ossoff will face immense pressure to flip. If not, it could mean that the GOP strategy of holding out until Democrats feel the heat and cave is failing.",
      "Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii",
      "Schatz was one of the 10 key Democrats who voted to drop the filibuster and allow Republicans to pass a six-month government funding bill that prevented a shutdown at the most recent deadline in March. Schatz didn\u2019t vote for the underlying funding bill like Shaheen and King did, but his and other Democrats\u2019 votes to allow Republicans to get around the filibuster provoked a furious response from the liberal base.",
      "Schatz is in a unique position as a Schumer deputy who has his finger on the pulse of both the Democratic conference and the party base (including its younger and more online activists). He\u2019s among the limited group of senators who are adept at social media, where much of the debate is taking place. And he\u2019s in pole position to be the next Senate Democratic whip and replace the retiring Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill.",
      "In the run-up to the current shutdown, Schatz offered \u201cfree advice\u201d to Republicans, vowing that \u201canother jam job is not going to work\u201d and that the GOP needs to negotiate with Democrats to achieve a successful product. He made good on that warning.",
      "Schatz could be a bellwether for the direction of the caucus and whether a sufficient number of Democrats can accept a bill to reopen the government. If he\u2019s on board, other fence-sitters in the conference may feel more comfortable supporting it."

    "story": [
      "The humble soybean is the latest flashpoint in the Trump administration\u2019s campaign to reshape global trade.",
      "Used in everything from animal feed to fuel, soybeans regularly rank among the most valuable U.S. agricultural exports, towering over higher-profile crops like corn and cotton.",
      "More than $30 billion worth of American soybean products were exported in fiscal year 2024, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "For American soybean farmers, their top overseas market has long been China, which bought around a third of the export crop \u2014 approximately $12 billion worth of American soybean products \u2014 in the last calendar year, USDA data shows.",
      "But not anymore.",
      "As President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war leaves U.S.-China relations somewhere between frosty and openly hostile, America\u2019s soybean farmers appear to be an early casualty.",
      "An embargo in all but name",
      "So far, China has not purchased any U.S. soybeans during this year\u2019s main harvest period, with sales falling to zero in May.",
      "This has pushed many American farmers reliant on soybeans nearly to the breaking point.",
      "It has also complicated the Trump administration\u2019s plans to provide billions in foreign economic aid to Argentina.",
      "Buenos Aires recently sold more than 2.5 million metric tons of soybeans to Beijing, after briefly suspending its export tax on the soy products.",
      "U.S. officials blame China for the looming crisis facing American soybean producers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate the Chinese leadership has decided to use the American farmers, soybean farmers in particular, as a hostage or pawn in the trade negotiations,\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Thursday on CNBC.",
      "Farmers view the situation differently, however. They want Trump to reach a trade deal with China that ends the unofficial embargo on soybeans. But instead, what they see is the White House preparing to bail out one of their chief rivals for the Chinese export market.",
      "\u201cThe frustration is overwhelming,\u201d American Soybean Association President Caleb Ragland said in a recent statement.",
      "Meanwhile, China \u2014 the world\u2019s biggest buyer of soybeans \u2014indicated last week that it won\u2019t resume U.S. purchases unless more Trump tariffs are lifted.",
      "\u201cAs for soybean trade, the U.S. side should take proactive steps to remove relevant unreasonable tariffs, create conditions for expanding bilateral trade, and inject more stability and certainty into global economic development,\u201d Commerce Ministry spokesperson He Yadong told reporters in Beijing.",
      "Emergency relief is coming",
      "The Trump administration will announce new support for farmers, \u201cespecially the soybean farmers,\u201d on Tuesday, Bessent said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re also going to be working with the Farm Credit Bureau to make sure that the farmers have what they need for the next planting season,\u201d he added.",
      "Bessent personally owns as much as $25 million worth of farmland in North Dakota that produces corn and soybeans, according to his recent financial disclosures.",
      "He said soybeans would be a topic of discussion at the upcoming meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum later this month.",
      "Trump is also aware of the impact his trade policies are having on American farmers, starting with soybean growers.",
      "\u201cThe Soybean Farmers of our Country are being hurt because China is, for \u2018negotiating\u2019 reasons only, not buying,\u201d the president posted Wednesday on Truth Social.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve made so much money on Tariffs, that we are going to take a small portion of that money, and help our Farmers,\u201d Trump added.",
      "The question is whether this aid will come soon enough to save this year\u2019s massive harvest of soybeans.",
      "At the center of the firestorm is Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, who warned this week that \u201cthis moment of uncertainty in the farm economy is real.\u201d Speaking on Fox Business Network, she emphasized that Trump has long supported U.S. farmers.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump and Secretary Rollins are always in touch about the needs of our farmers, who played a crucial role in the President\u2019s November victory,\u201d the White House said in a statement Thursday. \u201cHe has made clear his intention to use tariff revenue to help our agricultural sector, but no final decisions on the contours of this plan have been made.\u201d",
      "The Argentina factor",
      "The current U.S.-China stalemate over soybean exports is also complicating another American foreign policy conundrum: what to do about Argentina\u2019s faltering economy.",
      "As U.S. soybean exports to China screech to a halt, Argentina\u2019s farmers jumped at the opportunity to sell China their own soybeans.",
      "From their perspective, a potential U.S. economic aid package has nothing to do with their soybean exports, and everything to do with the personal and political alliance between Trump and libertarian President Javier Milei.",
      "Milei was the first foreign leader to visit Trump after his 2024 election victory, and he has become a familiar face at U.S. political events attended by the president\u2019s MAGA supporters.",
      "At a Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington, D.C. in February, Milei gifted then-Department of Government Efficiency chief Elon Musk a red chainsaw.",
      "Musk then waved it around onstage, calling it \u201cthe chainsaw for bureaucracy.\u201d",
      "Eight months later, Milei\u2019s popularity with voters has plunged, raising doubts about the future of his market-friendly economic reforms and strict austerity measures.",
      "Local elections in early September dealt a blow to Milei\u2019s party, triggering massive turmoil in Argentina\u2019s stock and currency markets.",
      "A few weeks after the market plunge, Bessent announced on social media that the U.S. was prepared to deploy billions of dollars to support the South American country.",
      "A presidential delegation from Buenos Aires is expected to visit the White House next week to finalize the U.S. foreign aid deal.",
      "This has infuriated the soybean farmers.",
      "\u201cU.S. soybean prices are falling, harvest is underway, and farmers read headlines not about securing a trade agreement with China, but that the U.S. government is extending $20 billion in economic support to Argentina while that country drops its soybean export taxes to sell 20 shiploads of Argentine soybeans to China in just two days,\u201d Ragland said.",
      "Meanwhile, Milei has also secured a currency swap line for Argentina from China, a situation that gives pause to some in Washington.",
      "In response, Milei has said Argentina will maintain its mutually beneficial trade and economic relationship with China.",
      "Tensions inside the Trump administration over China, Argentina and the soybean farmers broke into the open last week.",
      "While attending the U.N. General Assembly, Bessent received a text message from a contact labeled \u201cBR.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe bailed out Argentina yesterday \u2026 and in return, the Argentine\u2019s removed their export tariff on grains, reducing their price, and sold a bunch of soybeans to China at a time when we would normally be selling to China,\u201d read the message, widely presumed to come from Rollins.",
      "\u201cSoy prices are dropping further because of it. This gives China more leverage on us,\u201d the message concluded.",
      "Spokespeople for Bessent and Rollins did not respond to questions about the text message exchange."

      "\u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d star Chase Infiniti admits it took a bit of arm twisting to get some of the cast, including her on-screen co-star Leonardo DiCaprio, to jump on the TikTok trend bandwagon to promote their latest film.",

After Willa is kidnapped by her father\u2019s former enemy, Col. Steven J. Lockjaw (Sean Penn) \u2014 who was also behind the disappearance of her mother, Perfidia Beverly Hills (Teyana Taylor) \u2014 she and Bob fight for their survival.",
      "Leading up to the Sept. 26 release of the film, Infiniti enlisted her co-stars Regina Hall, Teyana Taylor, Benicio del Toro, Leo DiCaprio and Sean Penn for a series of social media promos that nodded to current internet trends.",
      "She even tapped the film\u2019s director Anderson for the \u201cOh, That\u2019s Not Bad\u201d trend, and managed to snag DiCaprio for a remix to the \u201cBob Girl Summer\u201d trend, with the Oscar winner lipsyncing Nicki Minaj\u2019s verse on the \u201cB.o.B\u201d song.",
      "The film\u2019s social media promos, which quickly went viral and amassed millions of views across platforms, were an immediate hit online with early support from the director, DiCaprio and the Warner Bros. marketing team, who helped to spearhead the campaign.",
      "Speaking to TODAY.com about how it all came together, Infiniti explains that after being given the directive to \u201cstart making TikToks,\u201d she says it took a bit of persuading to actually get her co-stars on board.",
      "\u201cI remember right when we were about to start the press tour, Paul and Leo were like, \u2018Hey, we need you to get on Tiktok and you start making TikToks.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018OK, you guys are going to have to be in them too. I hope you\u2019re ready for that,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd then I would literally just show up with different, like, trends or ideas that I would see and I would show an example.\u201d",
      "She continues, \u201cI\u2019d be like, \u2018Do you like this? Yes or no?\u2019 And then if they said \u2018Yes,\u2019 or if I could convince them, then we would get the Tiktok.\u201d",

I promise it\u2019s fun,\u2019\u201d she says, before later sharing her personal plea to Sean Penn. \u201cI was like, \u2018Please, please be in the video, Sean, it would be so good.\u2019\u201d",
      "The \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d breakout star says it did take some heavy maneuvering and hand-holding for her to get the TikTok trends just right.",
      "\u201cIt was me being like, \u2018Stand here. You\u2019re going to say this,\u2019 or, \u2018You don\u2019t have to say anything, but you\u2019re going to stand here and move here.\u2019 And it was kind of me just placing them where they needed to go,\u201d she says.",
      "Eventually, Infiniti explains, \u201cthe more that we did it, the more that they enjoyed them.\"",
      "The real test of success was when she was given a thumbs up of approval by Anderson\u2019s kids, whom he shares with actor Maya Rudolph.",
      "\u201cSo I was like, \u2018That\u2019s how I know that I\u2019m doing it right,\u2019\u201d she quipped.",
      "Now, following the film\u2019s release, the breakout star can easily break a smile as she reflects on her uncanny ability to turn Baby Boomers into certified TikTok stars. But, Infiniti shares, there is one specific promo that\u2019s her pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance and lives in her head rent free.",
      "\u201cThe one I was the most excited to get was the, \u2018What\u2019s your name? B.o.B. So they calling you Bob,\u2019 with Leo. I was very happy to get that one,\u201d she beams.",
      "While the film\u2019s promotional run has come to an end, \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d seems to keep the door open for more of the story. When asked if there could be a sequel following the dark comedy\u2019s dramatic ending, Infiniti tells TODAY.com that she\u2019s open to it and teases what she\u2019d like to see.",
      "\u201cI think that if Willa and Perfidia ever had the chance to reunite, getting to witness that and to see how that would play out would be really interesting, because of the time spent apart, the things that have happened in between,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cI think that that feels like a wonderful close of the book, closing the chapter temporarily. I\u2019m not sure what will happen in the future, but that\u2019s why we\u2019re hopeful,\u201d she says.",
      "As far as where the story may go for her character\u2019s dad Bob, Infiniti jokes she hopes he finally gets the help he needs.",
      "\u201cI hope Bob does not stay as paranoid,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that my biggest hope for Bob is that he can actually, like, sit on the couch and chill. He doesn\u2019t have to be as paranoid as he has been in the past.\u201d",

      "The 21-year-old wildlife conservationist, who heated up the \"DWTS\" dance floor by ripping off his shirt during his salsa with pro partner Witney Carson on the Sept. 29 episode, says the idea of him joining the ABC reality dating series is not out of the question.",
      "\"Hey, I mean, never say never,\" Irwin told \"Entertainment Tonight\" after hearing the pitch.",

      "\"Monster\" looks into the making of a killer whose gruesome crimes and family backstory would go on to inspire horror films like \"Psycho\" and \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\"",
      "Charlie Hunnam stars as Ed Gein, who was nicknamed the \"Butcher of Plainfield\" for the house of horrors found in his Plainfield, Wisconsin home.",
      "Here's what to know about Henry and Ed Gein.",
      "Who were Henry and Ed Gein?",
      "Henry and Ed Gein were the two children born to Augusta and George Gein in Wisconsin in the early 1900s \u2014 Henry in 1902 and Ed in 1906.",
      "The Gein biography \"Deviant,\" written by the true crime writer Harold Schechter, describes Augusta as a \"domestic tyrant\" and a woman of strict religious conviction, bordering on \"madness.\"",
      "RELATED: Who Was Ed Gein\u2019s Mother, Augusta? All About the Woman Who Raised a \u2018Monster\u2019",
      "The boys grew up on a remote farm, six miles outside of Plainfield, per the book. There, she handled her sons' \"religious and moral training.\" She emphasized, to her sons, the \"wickedness of modern women.\"",
      "What Happened Between Ed and Henry Gein?",
      "Schechter wrote that the boys had a \"good relationship,\" but disagreed on one thing: their mom.",
      "Henry Gein once confronted Ed Gein about their mother, raising \u201csome serious questions about her hold over her younger son.\u201d",
      "Ed Gein, in response, was \u201castonished\u201d to learn his brother didn\u2019t also regard their mother as a \u201csaint on earth.\u201d",
      "\u201cHenry\u2019s implied criticism of Augusta came as a real shock to Eddie,\u201d Schechter wrote.",
      "This conversation is seemingly depicted in \u201cMonster.\u201d Standing with Ed in a barn, Henry lays out his plan to leave the family, find freedom from their controlling mother and marry the woman he loves, of whom Augusta disapproves",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t do the religion no more. The cage she built for herself, Ed. She\u2019s trapped in it. Look at me. Right in the eye. You\u2019re gonna get trapped in it, too. Listen to me. I\u2019m getting out of here. I\u2019m leaving you. Do you understand?\u201d Henry says.",
      "He also urges Ed to leave Augusta's grip, too, saying, \"You need to get out of here too. Mother is sick. She\u2019s a sick woman.\u201d",
      "He also seems to pick up on the route Ed is going down, saying, \"You\u2019ve always been a peculiar type. Mother\u2019s making you very strange. I hate to see you like that.\u201d",
      "Ed, meanwhile, is resistant to anyone going against his mom. \"I don't want to hear that. Don't talk like that about her,\" he says.",
      "Did Ed Gein Really Kill His Brother?",
      "In the show, Ed fatally strikes his brother with a log after the conversation. Ed then imagines him standing up and saying he changed his mind about Augusta \u2013\u00a0but in actuality, he's dead. Ed later drags Henry's frozen body out into a marsh and starts a fire.",
      "Schechter, in \"Deviant,\" wrote about the mystery of Henry Gein's death at the age of 43. The \"single indisputable fact\" about Henry Gein's death was that it happened May 16, 1944. The rest? Up to debate.",
      "It did happen after the brothers were taking care of a fire on marshland near their home, Schechter wrote. Ed Gein later said that when the fire got out of control, he was separated from his brother. Later, he led a search to find Henry Gein \u2014 and led investigators right to the spot where his brother lay.",
      "\"Several odd things immediately struck the searchers. First, though the corpse was stretched out on a scorched piece of ground, there were no signs that Henry had been injured by the flames. His clothes were soot-covered but otherwise undamaged, and the exposed part of his body was similarly free of burns,\" Schechter wrote.",
      "They also notice that Ed Gein's story didn't align: Before, he couldn't find his brother, but he led searchers directly there.",
      "Henry Gein's cause of death was determined to be asphyxiation and the coroner decided a further inquest was not necessary.",
      "Their mother died the following year.",
      "Ed Gein never confessed to killing his brother but, in 1957, did confess to murdering two women: Beatrice Worden, a local hardware store owner, and Mary Hogan, a tavern operator."

      "\"I have favorite words, favorite phrases, things that I\u2019ll put in an endless file of lyrics that I\u2019m just constantly going to go and cherry pick from when I\u2019m writing. And I had written down the word opalite because I learned that it\u2019s actually a man-made opal. Opal can be man-made just like diamonds,\" she said.",
      "The singer went on to note that opal is Travis' birthstone and she's always \"loved that stone.\"",
      "\"I thought it was a kind of a cool metaphor that it\u2019s a man-made opal and happiness can also be man-made too. So that\u2019s kind of what the song is about: the kind of juxtaposition of those two,\" she said.",
      "'Wood'",
      "\"Wood\" is the shortest song on \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" but it's still chock-full of meaning. The track is about being unlucky in love then finding the one she needs.",
      "Fans are picking up on the song's seeming double entendres, as well as the reference to Kelce's \"New Heights\" podcast.",
      "\"Baby, I\u2019ll admit I\u2019ve been a little superstitious/ The curse on me was broken by your magic wand/ Seems to me that you and me, we make our own luck/ New heights of manhood/ I ain\u2019t gotta knock on wood,\" she sings.",
      "\"The Fate of Ophelia\"",
      "In \"The Fate of Ophelia,\" Swift rewrites the story of Ophelia, one of many doomed characters in William Shakespeare's \"Hamlet.\"",
      "In the song, Swift seems to reference Kelce's bold romantic gesture when he tried to meet her at her \"Eras Tour\" and give her a friendship bracelet with his number on it.",
      "\u201cI heard you calling/ On the megaphone/ You wanna see me all alone,\u201d she sings.",
      "Swift also appears to credit Kelce with saving her from the fate of Ophelia as she sings, \"And if you\u2019d never come for me/ I might\u2019ve drowned in the melancholy.\"",
      "During an interview with iHeart, she explained, \u201cThe hook is like, someone comes into your life and rescues you from the fate of being driven mad by love.\u201d",
      "Swift seems to shout out Kelce's Kansas City Chiefs as she sings, \"Pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes.\"",
      "'Wi$h Li$t'",
      "Swift is clearly lucky in love with Kelce and she appears to sing all about her dreams for their future in \u201cWi$h Li$t.\u201d",
      "\"I just want you/ Have a couple kids, got the whole block looking like you/ We tell the world to leave us the f--- alone, and they do,\" she sings.",
      "Later in the song, Swift appears to sing about how she dreamed of finding someone like Kelce.",
      "\"I made wishes on all of the stars/ Please, God bring me a best friend who I think is hot/ I thought I had it right once, twice, but I did not/ You caught me off my guard/ I hope I get what I want/ Cause I know what I want/ I just want you,\" she sings.",
      "While appearing on iHeart Radio, Swift said this particular song is a \u201cvery accurate stance on where I\u2019m at in life.\u201d",
      "'Eldest Daughter'",
      "Swift, who is an eldest daughter herself, sings about many topics, including marriage, in her song \"Eldest Daughter.\"",
      "She even references a youngest child, presumably Kelce. He's the youngest of two boys (and brother Jason Kelce is also an NFL pro).",
      "\u201cWhen I said I don\u2019t believe in marriage, that was a lie/ Every eldest daughter was the first lamb to the slaughter/ So we all dressed up as wolves and we looked fire/ But I\u2019m not a bad b---/ And this isn\u2019t savage/ But I\u2019m never gonna let you down/ I\u2019m never gonna leave you out,\u201d she sings.",
      "Swift goes on to say she once made fun of things like \u201cFerris wheels, kisses and lilac,\u201d sing, \u201cCause I thought that I\u2019d never find that.\"",
      "'Honey'",
      "During the love song \"Honey,\" Swift sings about her past experiences with pet names.",
      "\"When anyone called me sweetheart, it was passive aggressive at the bar/ And the b---- was telling me to back off/ Cause her man had looked at me wrong/ If anyone called me honey it was standing in the bathroom, white teeth/ They were saying that skirt don\u2019t fit me and I cried the whole way home,\" she sings.",
      "Swift then transitions to her present situation, where pet names have a positive connotation.",
      "\"But you touch my face redefine all of those blues/ When you say/ You can call me honey if you want because I\u2019m the one you want/ I\u2019m the one you want/ You give it different meaning/ Cause you mean it when you talk,\" she sings.",
      "'Elizabeth Taylor'",
      "Elizabeth Taylor, who was married seven times, knew a thing or two about high-profile relationships. In this song named after the late actor, Swift sings, \"Elizabeth Taylor, do you think it\u2019s forever?\" as she talks about a relationship.",
      "She goes on to describe how this particular romance is different from her past ones, singing, \"All the right guys/ Promised they\u2019d stay/ Under bright lights/ They withered away/ But you bloom.\"",
      "In the song, Swift talks about a man who worships her while others criticize her. She also expresses her fears of losing their love.",
      "\"They say I\u2019m bad news/ I just say thanks/ And you look at me like you\u2019re hypnotized/ And I think you know why/ And if you ever leave me high and dry/I\u2019d cry my eyes violet,\" she sings."

      "Jake Griffin is a new detective on the squad in \"Law & Order: SVU,\" but which side is he working for?",
      "The second episode of Season 27, which aired Oct. 2, introduces Griffin, played by Corey Cott, as he gets off to a turbulent start under the command of Mariska Hargitay's Capt. Olivia Benson.",

      "Detective Jake Griffin Has Friends in High Places",
      "The episode reveals that Jake Griffin's late father is a former partner of Benson's new boss, Chief Kathryn Tynan, played by Noma Dumezweni. Griffin tells Benson that Tynan took him \"under her wing\" following his father\u2019s death.",
      "He immediately raises the concern to Benson that she might think he's \"some sort of spy\" for Tynan due to his connection to the chief. He insists he's just working under Benson to \"learn how to become a good detective.\"",

      "\"Chief Tynan's inside waiting for you,\" John says.",
      "Griffin thanks John and walks up the steps to the brownstone.",

      "Like her \u201cFriends\u201d character, Monica Geller, Courteney Cox enjoys inviting loved ones over to her immaculately clean home in Los Angeles for good food and fun times.",
      "In fact, the actor and Homecourt founder is still hosting the same weekly Sunday night dinner party she began years ago, she told TODAY style correspondent Zanna Roberts Rassi in an interview that aired Oct. 3.",
      "\"My grandmother used to have Sunday gatherings ... and I\u2019m the youngest of 21 first cousins. So when I moved to LA, there wasn\u2019t really a community, because everyone lives so far. So I started doing my own Sundays,\" said Cox.",
      "As you can imagine, Cox's invitees over the years have included plenty of A-listers and even a few \"dream guests.\"",
      "\"I mean, look, I had Elton John there and I played the piano with him. So that would have been a dream. I mean, Stevie Wonder,\" Cox recalled.",
      "It was Cox's close friend Ed Sheeran who brought Sir Elton to her home. Musical magic happened when Cox, Sheeran and singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile joined John for a cover of his 1972 hit \"Tiny Dancer,\" featuring Cox on the piano.",
      "The quartet hilariously opted to sing the mistaken lyrics Phoebe Buffet, played by Lisa Kudrow, once sang on \"Friends,\" which meant changing the phrase \"Hold me closer, tiny dancer\u201d to \u201cHold me closer, Tony Danza.\"",
      "How did Cox and Sheeran persuade Sir Elton to agree to sing such a silly version of his song?",
      "\"I\u2019ve known Ed for about, like, 13 years. I knew Brandi because we did a video together. And Ed said, 'I\u2019m going to have Elton over for dinner, if that\u2019s OK with you,'\" Cox recalled. \"And he said, 'Why don\u2019t you play one of the songs? We could do 'Hold Me Closer.' But he calls it 'Tony Danza,' because that\u2019s the Lisa Kudrow version, the Phoebe version.",
      "\"So I quickly called my piano teacher and said, 'You\u2019ve got to come over and teach me 'Tiny Dancer,'\" Cox continued, adding \"The reason why I stopped the video when I did is because that\u2019s all I had learned. That was it.\"",
      "Cox called performing the song with John \"one of the greatest moments\" of her life.",
      "Sheeran brought a different kind of magic into Cox's life when he showed up to her place one night with members of the Irish rock band Snow Patrol.",
      "Despite the fact that Taylor Swift was also at her home that night, Cox right away noticed the band's guitarist Johnny McDaid, who would later become her boyfriend.",
      "\"I remember seeing (McDaid), and I thought, 'Oh, he\u2019s a really handsome guy.' But we didn\u2019t have this moment at all. And then later on he asked me out,\" she shared.",
      "Cox may have channeled Monica Geller's love of a beautiful living space when she launched Homecourt, her line of luxury home and beauty care products.",
      "\"I was thinking, God, we\u2019re home all the time. The most important thing to us is where we live. We take care of our skin, our hair. So why not care about your home in the same way?\" she said.",
      "Cox, who said she's \"involved in every part\" of Homecourt, told Rassi she's excited about the company's new Cece Body Collection, which was inspired by her signature scent.",
      "\"It's cardamom and cedar wood and cinnamon,\" said Cox. \"It's smoky and sexy.\""

    "summary": "How is Psycho based on the life of Ed Gein? The new show Monster shows how the two are in converasation.",
    "story": [
      "Is one of the most chilling characters in horror movie history based on a real person?",
      "Before there was Norman Bates, the knife-wielding murderer obsessed with his late mother in the seminal 1960 movie \"Psycho,\" there was Ed Gein, a killer whose crimes at his Wisconsin farm were discovered in 1957.",
      "\"The Butcher of Plainfield\" is the subject of the new Netflix series \"Monster: The Ed Gein Story,\" which starts streaming on Oct. 3. Charlie Hunnam plays Gein, who admitted to murdering two people and was found with numerous objects made from human skin at his Wisconsin farm.",
      "\"Psycho\" was a groundbreaking film that terrified audiences with its portrayal of a human killer rather than the supernatural ghouls  who previously were the main characters in most horror movies.",
      "\"Prior to actually Ed Gein, our relationship with monsters in cinema was Dracula, Frankenstein and werewolves,\" Charlie Hunnam, who plays Gein in \u201cMonster,\u201d said on TODAY on Sept. 30. \"And 'Psycho' was the pivot point where we became the monsters, and that was all of a direct consequence of the influence that Ed Gein had had.\"",
      "Gein's life has been a catalyst for some of the most legendary horror and suspense movies of all time.",
      "\"He was the inspiration for Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho,' Buffalo Bill in 'Silence of the Lambs' and 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre,' so he had this huge cultural influence,\" Hunnam said. \"We sort of go back and look at the inspiration behind the inspiration for those films.\"",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about how Ed Gein\u2019s story played a role in the creation of \"Psycho.\"",
      "Who Was Ed Gein?",
      "Gein was raised with his brother in isolation at a Wisconsin farm in the 1920s and '30s by his domineering and fanatically religious mother,  plus a father who drank heavily and was often violent toward his children.",
      "Gein never married and lived at the family's farm in Plainfield after the death of both of his parents. In 1957, a local deputy found the decapitated body of a local missing woman, Bernice Worden, hanging in a lean-to on the side of his house.",
      "It led to the grisly discovery of preserved human heads, mummified body parts, skulls and items like lampshades and chair seats made out of human skin on Gein's property. He also confessed to killing tavern owner Mary Hogan in 1954 and said he exhumed corpses of women from local graveyards between 1944 and 1952.",
      "Is 'Psycho' Based on Ed Gein?",
      "Legendary director Alfred Hitchcock never explicitly said his 1960 movie starring Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates was based on Gein's life.",
      "However, the movie is based on the 1959 horror novel \"Psycho,\" by writer Robert Bloch. The novel came out two years after Gein's crimes made headlines.",
      "Hitchcock is a character in the Netflix series and is played by \"White Lotus\" star Tom Hollander, so the connection is part of the story in \"Monster.\"",
      "Block lived 50 miles from Gein\u2019s farmhouse in Wisconsin and based his book on Gein\u2019s story, the Milwaukee Sentinel-Journal reported at the time, according to a 1984 obituary of Gein by The Associated Press.",
      "The obituary also said the movie \"Psycho\" was \"reportedly\" based on Gein's story. Gein died at 77 after spending all of his time in Wisconsin mental institutions following his arrest in 1957. Another 1984 obituary by United Press International cited Gein as the inspiration for \"Psycho.\"",
      "How is Norman Bates in 'Psycho' Similar to Ed Gein?",
      "One aspect the two clearly share is an unhealthy obsession with their mothers.",
      "Ed Gein was raised primarily on an isolated farm in Plainfield, Wisconsin, under the thumb of his domineering mother, Augusta Gein.",
      "Gein's fanatically religious mother isolated him from friends at school and drilled into him that women were immoral. Gein never married and became inseparable from his mother, worshipping her and seeking her approval.",
      "A report by Central State Hospital in Wisconsin in 1957 found that Gein, who was 51 at the time, was \u201cinordinately emotionally attached to his mother.\"",
      "\u201cAfter the death of his mother, he felt that he had a special power whereby he could raise the dead to life by an act of his will power; and when he found that this was not successful, his emotional needs influenced him to attempt the re-creation of his mother by using the parts of bodies from other graves,\u201d the report states.",
      "In the movie \"Psycho,\" a young man named Norman Bates, played by Anthony Perkins, operates a motel in California with a side hobby as a taxidermist. Perkins makes an appearance as a character in \"Monster,\" played by Joey Pollari.",
      "Similar to Gein's farm in Plainfield, the Bates Motel is located in a remote small town.",
      "The film makes it ambiguous at first whether it's Bates or his mother who has killed a hotel guest and then a detective searching for her at the motel.",
      "In a chilling scene, the sister of a character whom Bates killed discovers the mummified body of Bates' mother in a fruit cellar. Bates then appears in women's clothes and a wig.",
      "The big reveal after Bates is caught is that he killed his mother and then kept her corpse in his home out of guilt. He developed a split personality as Bates and \"Mother,\" often holding a conversation between the two personas.",
      "Much like Gein avoiding relationships with women due to his mother's relentless harping on their immorality, Bates would hear the voice of \"Mother\" in his head whenever he was attracted to a woman.",
      "In the report by Central State Hospital, Gein told interviewers that he \"heard his mother talking to him on several occasions for about a year after she died.\u201d",
      "The theme of dressing up dead women in connection with his mother is mentioned in the report from the Wisconsin hospital. Interviewers describing his grave robbing wrote that \"it seems probable that this activity was the result of his desire to re-create the existence of his own mother,\" although Gein denied it.",
      "Sensationalizing Gein's crimes in popular movies and other creative works over decades is broached on \"Monster.\"",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s one of the questions we ask on the show is, \u2018Who is the monster?\u2019 This boy who did terrible things but had been abused and left in isolation with untreated mental health issues, or this legion of filmmakers that took inspiration from his life and sensationalized for entertainment and arguably darkened the American psyche in the process?\u201d Hunnam said on TODAY."

      "During a Sept. 30 appearance on \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,\u201d Johnson shared he had 22 prosthetics and put on just over 30 pounds of muscle to embody Kerr. He also took a moment to give Kerr his flowers.",
      "Johnson explained to Fallon that before the \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d credits roll, there are title cards (or film intertitles) that include information about the real-life Kerr.",
      "\u201cThese fighters today, they make millions of dollars and everyone knows their name,\u201d Johnson, 53, said. \u201cBut his name is Mark Kerr.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d centers on Kerr during 1997 to 2000, focusing on his formative years as a wrestler and his rise to fame. It also chronicled his addiction to painkillers, his subsequent overdose and tumultuous marriage to Dawn Staples-Kerr (portrayed by Emily Blunt).",
      "The film is inspired by the 2002 HBO documentary \u201cThe Smashing Machine: The Life and Times of Extreme Fighter Mark Kerr.\u201d",
      "Although considered a pioneer in the MMA and UFC world, Kerr received a different type of fame and attention compared to wrestlers and WWE athletes like Johnson, aka The Rock, who became a household name.",
      "But now, years later, Kerr, 56, is having his own moment in the public eye thanks to thanks to the film named after his UFC stage name, \"The Smashing Machine.\"",
      "Kerr was in attendance when \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d premiered at the Venice Film Festival. While on the \u201cTonight Show,\u201d Johnson reflected on sitting alongside Kerr when the crowd erupted in applause after the film ended.",
      "\u201cI was so happy for him, for Mark, because it was his validation that despite your struggles, despite the fact you overdosed twice and you\u2019re still here \u2014 he\u2019s lucky to be alive \u2014 things turned out OK and you are an inspiration for everybody,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cMark Kerr is unbelievable.\u201d",
      "Kerr has been promoting the film alongside Johnson, Blunt and director Benny Safdie. During this time, he's also shared more insight into his current life.",
      "What Happened to Mark Kerr?",
      "The film ends with footage of the real-life Kerr grocery shopping in Scottsdale, Arizona. He greets the cashier, loads up his groceries, hops into his truck and departs the parking lot. This moment signals that Kerr appears to have somewhat of a normal life after years of being in the public eye as a wrestler.",
      "As shown in the film, and reflected in his real life, Kerr made his professional MMA debut on Jan. 19. 1997, competing in the heavyweight tournament as part of World Vale Tudo Championship 3. He won three of his matches, securing the tournament title.",

      "He retired from the sport in 2009, UFC notes, and was inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame in June 2025.",
      "During his time as a professional athlete, Kerr was addicted to prescribed painkillers which he used to ease the blows from his fights. He's been open about overdosing due to his addiction.",

      "He was previously married to Dawn Staples, and their relationship is depicted in \"The Smashing Machine.\" The former couple share a son named Bryce.",
      "He's also been an advocate for mental health, hoping to help those who struggle with addiction. He touched on his advocacy during his speech when he was inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame in July 2025.",
      "Kerr has also been doing interviews ahead of the release of \u201cThe Smashing Machine,\u201d talking about seeing Johnson transform into his former self.",
      "\u201cI could still see him in there, but I\u2019m looking at like a mirror picture of myself and it\u2019s this experience where I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh my god, man,\u2019\u201d he said during an interview on the \u201cJoe Rogan Experience\u201d podcast. \u201cLike, wow... This is you going to a place that nobody even thought you could get to. It was incredible.\u201d",

For the first time, I could actually see my part in it,\u201d he said. \u201cLike, I could see my part, how f------ hard I was on the people around me, how just singularly driven I was to accomplish something at all cost. And the person that paid it the most was Dawn. She paid a heavy price.\u201d",
      "Days before the movie arrived in theaters, Sports Illustrated also released Kerr's joint interview with Johnson looking back at their careers and the film.",
      "\u201cBenny Safdie said this about you,\u201d Johnson told Kerr. \u201cI\u2019m paraphrasing here, but one of the greatest triumphs about our film is the fact that you, yourself, as a human being, as a real man, Mark Kerr, found your own authenticity and finally after all these years, you are comfortable with who you are today.\u201d"

      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost as if Swift is passing the torch to the next generation of showgirls as she takes a bow. Could it be her final one? Well, no. This showgirl won\u2019t be left for dead; she\u2019s immortal now. \u2018We will see you next time,\u2019 Swift promises as an audience cheers. After all, despite the rock on her finger, Swift is married to the hustle \u2014 and with an album as good as this one, she might even try to outdo herself, again. That\u2019s just show business for you.\u201d",
      "Billboard",
      "Billboard's Jason Lipshutz went all in in his review.",
      "\"The result is a collection of songs that are immediately engrossing and among the most affecting of Swift\u2019s career, while also focusing on topics like Hamlet and suburban bliss. Call it Bangers for Adults,\" he wrote.",
      "\"For the countless fans who have grown up alongside Swift, 'The Life of a Showgirl' offers a settled, grown-up phase of the love stories that she\u2019s been telling for decades \u2014 although the album doesn\u2019t rely on clich\u00e9s, or go heavy on the cheese.\"",
      "Variety",
      "\"On 'The Life of a Showgirl,' though, love seems easy-fought,\" Chris Willman wrote in Variety. \"And the belief that it might actually be a breeze, instead of, like, the eye of a hurricane, makes for an album that stands as close to being an uncomplicated good time as anything she\u2019s ever done.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s too late for Swift to have a 'song of the summer,' but this feels like the Album of the Summer \u2014 the calendar be damned. It\u2019s giddy, funny, touching, silly, haughty and moving in about equal measure, but most of all, it\u2019s got a sunstruck kind of love that besottedly seeps through the orange LP grooves and might even make you believe in romance again, too,\" he added at the end of the review.",
      "NPR",
      "\"For the first time on a recording in a while, Swift is having fun,\" NPR's Ann Powers wrote. Her voice has never sounded stronger, the collaboration with her studio mates never easier.",
      "\"Her lyrics may focus on how her romance with fianc\u00e9 Travis Kelce brought her back from a fatal heartbreak, but the bangers that are the point of 'The Life of a Showgirl' trumpet another resurrection: Taylor Swift as Western pop\u2019s definitive presence, the star that couldn\u2019t be dimmed,\" she added.",
      "Los Angeles Times",
      "Mikael Wood did not rave in his review, while comparing Swift's latest effort to her last album, \"The Tortured Poets Department.\"",
      "\"As a piece of psychological portraiture, though \u2014 the framework, for better or for worse, by which Swift has trained us to interpret her music \u2014 this collection of expertly tailored bops falls well short of its predecessor; 'Showgirl' feels like a retreat from the vivid bloodletting of 'Tortured Poets,' which captured a woman whose one-of-one success had emboldened her to speak certain toxic truths,\" he wrote.",
      "Wood does conceded the album will result in several hits, but laments the lyrical unsophistication.",
      "\"There\u2019s no denying that Swift\u2019s lyrics about love here lack the kind of depth she\u2019s mined in tunes thought to have been inspired by the dastardly likes of John Mayer and Matty Healy,\" he wrote, alluding to a pair of Swift's exes.",
      "The New York Times",
      "\"Swift has been pop\u2019s alpha figure for more than a decade, a spot she\u2019s clung to ruthlessly,\" The New York Times Jon Caramanica wrote in his review. \u201cShowgirl\u201d isn\u2019t precisely a goodbye to all that, but it does cast a wary eye on her past while greeting her future with a glee that verges on the unbridled. It also serves as an implicit capstone to Swift\u2019s career to date.\"",
      "Caramanica also couldn't help but talk about how \"Showgirl\" marks Swift's growth since earlier albums.",
      "\"A catchy and substantive but unflashy album, it takes the songwriting intimacy of her 'Folklore'/'Evermore' era and renders it with more clarity and oomph,\" he wrote."

      "The LDP voted on five leadership candidates in the first round, with Takaichi securing 183 votes to Koizumi\u2019s 164. Yoshimasa Hayashi, 64, the top spokesperson for the current Japanese government, came in third with 134 votes after a recent surge in polls.",
      "Votes in the first round were divided evenly between 294 LDP lawmakers and almost 1 million rank-and-file party members who were represented by 295 votes. Lawmakers favored the more moderate Koizumi, while party members preferred Takaichi, who has a passionate base.",
      "In the second round, lawmakers had the same number of votes while rank-and-file party members had 47, representing the 47 prefectures of Japan.",
      "Lawmakers in the second round voted 149 to 145 in favor of Takaichi, while party members gave her 36 votes compared with Koizumi\u2019s 11.",

      "Harry\u2019s camp rejected that outright.",
      "\u201cRecent reporting of The Duke\u2019s view of the tone of the meeting, is categorically false,\u201d a spokesperson told NBC News, referring to Harry\u2019s title, Duke of Sussex. \u201cThe quotes attributed to him are pure invention fed, one can only assume, by sources intent on sabotaging any reconciliation between father and son.\u201d",
      "The public feud over the meeting has only deepened tensions at a moment when the family is seeking to project unity, and it could set back attempts to mend the relationship, according to NBC News royal commentator Daisy McAndrew.",
      "\u201cI think the king will be really disappointed,\u201d she said.",
      "Harry had earlier sounded eager to build on the brief tea, emphasizing his desire to spend more time with his father while defending his tell-all memoir in an interview with Britain\u2019s Guardian newspaper following that trip to the U.K.",
      "The accusations from Harry\u2019s camp came just a week after the family showcased its finest pomp and pageantry during Trump\u2019s state visit \u2014 a triumph quickly overshadowed by a return to all-too-familiar controversy.",
      "While Trump\u2019s trip was only briefly marred by the Epstein scandal, the subject was soon back on newspaper front pages with new royal revelations.",
      "The king has instructed Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, the Duke and Duchess of York, that they will not be welcome at the royal Christmas, according to weekend reports in Britain\u2019s Telegraph and Sunday Times newspapers that cited multiple sources.",
      "Buckingham Palace did not respond to requests for comment on the report and on the statement from Harry\u2019s spokesperson.",
      "That comes after Ferguson was dropped as a patron by a number of charities following a newly surfaced email that revealed she had referred to Epstein as a \u201csupreme friend,\u201d despite the disgraced financier\u2019s conviction on sex offenses. A spokesperson for the duchess said the email was sent to counter a threat Epstein had made to sue her and accuse her of defamation.",
      "The disclosure reignited scrutiny of royal ties to Epstein, long centered on Andrew.",
      "The palace will hope, McAndrew said, that something else will \u201ccome along to take the attention away.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe problem with Andrew is he\u2019s always grabbing the attention back,\u201d she said.",
      "While at odds with itself in recent years, the royal family has also been buffeted by external crises.",
      "William described 2024 as the most challenging year of his life in comments that aired Sunday \u2014 a period that saw both his wife, Kate, the Princess of Wales, and his father undergo cancer treatment.",

      "Up against a Sunday deadline that Trump had set, Hamas said Friday that it would meet a major condition that the president laid out in his 20-point plan for the war\u2019s end: releasing all the hostages, living or dead. Hamas\u2019 caveat was that \u201cthe field conditions for the exchange are met.\u201d",
      "Hamas also said it was prepared to enter into negotiations and turn over administrative control of Gaza to a Palestinian body of technocrats.",
      "Trump had been waiting on an answer from Hamas since Monday, when he released his peace plan at the White House alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He took Hamas\u2019 announcement as a good sign.",

      "Ruby Chen, a hostage family member and a leading advocate, told NBC News: \u201cIt\u2019s a positive \u2014 we have cautious optimism. We know the president cares a lot about the hostages, so let\u2019s hope this is our time.\u201d",

      "The Middle East is a part of the world where conflict seems eternal, peace sporadic. Since President Harry Truman recognized the Jewish state in 1948, many presidents have tried to usher in peaceful relations between Israel and its Arab neighbors, only to see conflict erupt again and again.",

Trump\u2019s call on Israel to halt strikes will call Hamas\u2019 bluff over the coming days. It\u2019s now up to Hamas. We either see hostages coming out this week or the war will restart.\u201d",

      "Israeli forces have intercepted an aid flotilla bound for Gaza that was being closely watched around the world, boarding boats and detaining activists including Greta Thunberg who were seeking to break the blockade of the Palestinian enclave.",
      "All but three of the 43 vessels being tracked online by the Global Sumud Flotilla were listed as having been confirmed or assumed to have been stopped by Israeli forces on Thursday, with a total of 443 people \u201cforcibly taken from their vessels,\u201d organizers said in a statement.",
      "At least one of the vessels, the Mikeno, sailing under the French flag, appeared to reach just off Gaza\u2019s coast, according to the online tracker, although Global Sumud Flotilla said they had lost communication with the vessel.",
      "Another ship, the Marinette, sailing under a Polish flag, was still in communication, with six passengers onboard, they added.",
      "Israel\u2019s foreign ministry said only \u201cone last vessel\u201d remained at a distance. \u201cIf it approaches, its attempt to enter an active combat zone and breach the blockade will also be prevented,\u201d it said in a post on X.",
      "The hundreds of people detained would be taken to Israel and deported to Europe, it added.",
      "In an earlier video posted by the foreign ministry, Thunberg could be seen seated, wearing a keffiyeh and putting on her signature frog hat, with someone in military garb kneeling beside her.",
      "Referring to the flotilla as the \"Hamas-Sumud flotilla,\" the foreign ministry said several vessels had been stopped, with those onboard being transferred to an Israeli port. \"Greta and her friends are safe and healthy,\" it said, adding in a later post that deportation procedures to Europe were expected to begin once passengers arrived in Israel.",
      "Some 500 people have taken part in the Global Sumud Flotilla, seeking to deliver a symbolic aid package to the besieged enclave and send a message of resistance by breaking through Israel's naval blockade of the territory.",
      "Israel has maintained a land, air and sea blockade on Gaza since 2007, when Hamas seized power in the enclave.",
      "The flotilla was intercepted as Israeli forces continued their devastating assault on Gaza City, where scores of people have been killed in recent days and hundreds of thousands have been displaced. Deaths from starvation have also continued to rise, according to Palestinian health officials.",
      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz on Wednesday said the military had completed seizing the Nitzarim corridor to Gaza\u2019s shoreline and was cutting the enclave \u201cin two from north to south.\u201d",
      "He said this was the \u201clast opportunity\u201d for Palestinians in Gaza City to move south \u2014 and that those who remain will be considered \u201cterrorists and supporters of terror\u201d as Israeli forces carry out their assault at \u201cfull strength.\u201d",
      "The world is awaiting a response from Hamas to the peace plan unveiled by President Donald Trump alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this week.",
      "With global outrage mounting over Israel's assault on Gaza, the flotilla has been backed by sizable protests in the streets of European cities.",
      "The fleet has been beset by a number of incidents, including explosions, harassment by drones and jamming of communications, which activists say appeared to have been attempts to hinder the ships\u2019 movements.",
      "\u201cPrior to illegally boarding the ships, it appears as though the Israeli naval vessels intentionally damaged ship communications, in an attempt to block distress signals and stop the live-stream of their illegal boat boarding,\u201d the press office for the flotilla said in a statement.",
      "Greg Stoker, an American veteran aboard one of the boats, said around a dozen naval vessels with their transponders off had approached them while they were about 70 or 80 nautical miles from the Gaza coast.",
      "\u201cThey are currently hailing our vessels, telling us to turn off our engines and await further instructions, or our boats will be seized and we will face the consequences,\u201d Stoker, wearing a red life jacket, said in a shaky video posted on Instagram.",
      "A video posted on a Telegram media account associated with the flotilla appears to show one of its ships being sprayed with water with an on-screen caption saying the vessel is being \u201cwater canoned.\u201d Another post on the Telegram channel said one of the ships had \u201cbeen deliberately rammed at sea.\u201d",
      "Miriam Azem, the international advocacy coordinator for Adalah, the human rights organization and legal center helping represent the flotilla, said the \"aggressive tactics\" only add to the \"illegality of this interception.\"",
      "\"This interception, regardless of the way it was carried out, is unlawful. It\u2019s an abduction from the high seas, from international waters where Israel has no jurisdiction whatsoever,\" she said in a phone interview Thursday.",
      "The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea stipulates that a state has jurisdiction only up to 12 nautical miles from its shores. In general, states don\u2019t have the right to seize ships in international waters, though armed conflict is an exception.",

      "Under the plan, Israel\u2019s assault in Gaza would end immediately once both sides agree to the proposal, with all hostages, alive and dead, to be released within 72 hours. The plan says no one will be forced to leave Gaza and those who do can return.",

      "During that race, Trump highlighted a deep rift in the Democratic Party over the war that pitted pro-Israel moderates against liberal defenders of Palestinians. Though Trump\u2019s focus on helping negotiate a permanent ceasefire has waxed and waned over the course of his eight-plus months in office, the conflict was never off his radar.",

      "More than $30 billion worth of American soybean products were exported in fiscal year 2024, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "For American soybean farmers, their top overseas market has long been China, which bought around a third of the export crop \u2014 approximately $12 billion worth of American soybean products \u2014 in the last calendar year, USDA data shows.",
      "But not anymore.",
      "As President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war leaves U.S.-China relations somewhere between frosty and openly hostile, America\u2019s soybean farmers appear to be an early casualty.",
      "An embargo in all but name",
      "So far, China has not purchased any U.S. soybeans during this year\u2019s main harvest period, with sales falling to zero in May.",
      "This has pushed many American farmers reliant on soybeans nearly to the breaking point.",
      "It has also complicated the Trump administration\u2019s plans to provide billions in foreign economic aid to Argentina.",
      "Buenos Aires recently sold more than 2.5 million metric tons of soybeans to Beijing, after briefly suspending its export tax on the soy products.",
      "U.S. officials blame China for the looming crisis facing American soybean producers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate the Chinese leadership has decided to use the American farmers, soybean farmers in particular, as a hostage or pawn in the trade negotiations,\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Thursday on CNBC.",
      "Farmers view the situation differently, however. They want Trump to reach a trade deal with China that ends the unofficial embargo on soybeans. But instead, what they see is the White House preparing to bail out one of their chief rivals for the Chinese export market.",
      "\u201cThe frustration is overwhelming,\u201d American Soybean Association President Caleb Ragland said in a recent statement.",
      "Meanwhile, China \u2014 the world\u2019s biggest buyer of soybeans \u2014indicated last week that it won\u2019t resume U.S. purchases unless more Trump tariffs are lifted.",
      "\u201cAs for soybean trade, the U.S. side should take proactive steps to remove relevant unreasonable tariffs, create conditions for expanding bilateral trade, and inject more stability and certainty into global economic development,\u201d Commerce Ministry spokesperson He Yadong told reporters in Beijing.",
      "Emergency relief is coming",
      "The Trump administration will announce new support for farmers, \u201cespecially the soybean farmers,\u201d on Tuesday, Bessent said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re also going to be working with the Farm Credit Bureau to make sure that the farmers have what they need for the next planting season,\u201d he added.",
      "Bessent personally owns as much as $25 million worth of farmland in North Dakota that produces corn and soybeans, according to his recent financial disclosures.",
      "He said soybeans would be a topic of discussion at the upcoming meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum later this month.",
      "Trump is also aware of the impact his trade policies are having on American farmers, starting with soybean growers.",
      "\u201cThe Soybean Farmers of our Country are being hurt because China is, for \u2018negotiating\u2019 reasons only, not buying,\u201d the president posted Wednesday on Truth Social.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve made so much money on Tariffs, that we are going to take a small portion of that money, and help our Farmers,\u201d Trump added.",
      "The question is whether this aid will come soon enough to save this year\u2019s massive harvest of soybeans.",
      "At the center of the firestorm is Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, who warned this week that \u201cthis moment of uncertainty in the farm economy is real.\u201d Speaking on Fox Business Network, she emphasized that Trump has long supported U.S. farmers.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump and Secretary Rollins are always in touch about the needs of our farmers, who played a crucial role in the President\u2019s November victory,\u201d the White House said in a statement Thursday. \u201cHe has made clear his intention to use tariff revenue to help our agricultural sector, but no final decisions on the contours of this plan have been made.\u201d",
      "The Argentina factor",
      "The current U.S.-China stalemate over soybean exports is also complicating another American foreign policy conundrum: what to do about Argentina\u2019s faltering economy.",
      "As U.S. soybean exports to China screech to a halt, Argentina\u2019s farmers jumped at the opportunity to sell China their own soybeans.",
      "From their perspective, a potential U.S. economic aid package has nothing to do with their soybean exports, and everything to do with the personal and political alliance between Trump and libertarian President Javier Milei.",
      "Milei was the first foreign leader to visit Trump after his 2024 election victory, and he has become a familiar face at U.S. political events attended by the president\u2019s MAGA supporters.",
      "At a Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington, D.C. in February, Milei gifted then-Department of Government Efficiency chief Elon Musk a red chainsaw.",
      "Musk then waved it around onstage, calling it \u201cthe chainsaw for bureaucracy.\u201d",
      "Eight months later, Milei\u2019s popularity with voters has plunged, raising doubts about the future of his market-friendly economic reforms and strict austerity measures.",
      "Local elections in early September dealt a blow to Milei\u2019s party, triggering massive turmoil in Argentina\u2019s stock and currency markets.",
      "A few weeks after the market plunge, Bessent announced on social media that the U.S. was prepared to deploy billions of dollars to support the South American country.",
      "A presidential delegation from Buenos Aires is expected to visit the White House next week to finalize the U.S. foreign aid deal.",
      "This has infuriated the soybean farmers.",
      "\u201cU.S. soybean prices are falling, harvest is underway, and farmers read headlines not about securing a trade agreement with China, but that the U.S. government is extending $20 billion in economic support to Argentina while that country drops its soybean export taxes to sell 20 shiploads of Argentine soybeans to China in just two days,\u201d Ragland said.",
      "Meanwhile, Milei has also secured a currency swap line for Argentina from China, a situation that gives pause to some in Washington.",
      "In response, Milei has said Argentina will maintain its mutually beneficial trade and economic relationship with China.",
      "Tensions inside the Trump administration over China, Argentina and the soybean farmers broke into the open last week.",
      "While attending the U.N. General Assembly, Bessent received a text message from a contact labeled \u201cBR.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe bailed out Argentina yesterday \u2026 and in return, the Argentine\u2019s removed their export tariff on grains, reducing their price, and sold a bunch of soybeans to China at a time when we would normally be selling to China,\u201d read the message, widely presumed to come from Rollins.",
      "\u201cSoy prices are dropping further because of it. This gives China more leverage on us,\u201d the message concluded.",
      "Spokespeople for Bessent and Rollins did not respond to questions about the text message exchange."

    "summary": "Alibaba announced a new initiative aiming to reach AI superintelligence, heating up an arms race with American AI companies.",
    "story": [
      "Early last week in the Chinese tech hub of Hangzhou, a slick, larger-than-life video screen beamed out four words that would drive tech giant Alibaba\u2019s stock to historic levels and signal a shift in China\u2019s approach to artificial intelligence: \u201cRoadmap to Artificial Superintelligence.\u201d",
      "During his 23-minute keynote address at the flagship Alibaba Cloud conference, Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu charted out a future featuring artificial general intelligence (AGI) and artificial superintelligence (ASI). These terms point to a theorized era in which AI becomes roughly as smart as humans (AGI) and then much, much smarter (ASI).",
      "While these terms have been tossed around Silicon Valley for years, Wu\u2019s presentation was notable: Alibaba is now the first established Chinese tech giant to explicitly invoke AGI and ASI.",
      "\u201cAchieving AGI \u2014 an intelligent system with general human-level cognition \u2014 now appears inevitable. Yet AGI is not the end of AI\u2019s development, but its beginning,\u201d Wu said. \u201cIt will march toward ASI \u2014 intelligence beyond the human, capable of self-iteration and continuous evolution.\u201d",
      "\u201cASI will drive exponential technological leaps, carrying us into an unprecedented age of intelligence,\u201d Wu said, highlighting ASI\u2019s ability to help cure diseases, discover cleaner sources of energy and even unlock interstellar travel.",
      "The U.S. and China are the world\u2019s leading AI powers, each with immense computing capabilities and top-tier researchers developing cutting-edge systems. Yet observers have framed the countries as having different approaches to AI, with perceptions that China focuses more on real-world AI applications.",
      "For example, commentators recently argued that Beijing is currently \u201cwinning the race for AI robots\u201d against the U.S., as China is home to much of the world\u2019s most advanced robotics supply chains and a growing network of robotics, or embodied AI, labs.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been some commentary in Western media recently about how the U.S. is missing the point by pushing for AGI, while China is focusing solely on applications,\u201d said Helen Toner, interim executive director of Georgetown\u2019s Center for Security and Emerging Technology. \u201cThis is wrong.\u201d",
      "\u201cSome Chinese researchers and some parts of the Chinese government have been interested in AGI and superintelligence for a long time,\u201d Toner said, though she noted this view was primarily held by smaller startups like DeepSeek.",
      "Afra Wang, a researcher focusing on China\u2019s tech scene, said Alibaba\u2019s invocation of AGI and ASI was remarkable.",
      "\u201cThis ASI narrative is definitely something new, especially among the biggest tech companies in China,\u201d she told NBC News.",
      "Alibaba\u2019s \u201croadmap to artificial superintelligence\u201d seems to scramble mainstream perceptions. Any number of California techno-optimists, like Anthropic\u2019s Dario Amodei or xAI\u2019s Elon Musk, might have delivered Wu\u2019s speech, selling a technology-enabled utopia while largely sidestepping darker questions about how humanity would co-exist with or survive an era of digital superintelligence.",
      "The concept of superintelligence has long been on the minds of \u2014 if not explicitly guiding \u2014 prominent American AI companies. For example, OpenAI released an article focused on the safe development of superintelligent AI models in May 2023. \u201cNow is a good time to start thinking about the governance of superintelligence \u2014 future AI systems dramatically more capable than even AGI,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The possibility of superintelligence is now even being acknowledged in Congress. On Monday, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Ill., announced a draft bill that would, among other actions, \u201cassist Congress in determining the potential for controlled AI systems to reach artificial superintelligence.\u201d",
      "To some, ASI might seem like an outlandish concept when today\u2019s AI systems fail to understand basic tennis rules, hallucinate or fabricate basic information, or do not seem to actually comprehend how the external world functions.",
      "At the same time, AI systems continue to approach and sometimes surpass human capabilities in many domains, from driving cars safely to winning international coding competitions, leaving many experts to say it\u2019s a matter of when, not if, humans develop digital superintelligence.",
      "As the idea of superintelligence gradually enters mainstream debates, many American politicians have announced that the U.S. is in an AI race with China. The White House\u2019s current AI manifesto is titled \u201cWinning the AI Race: America\u2019s AI Action Plan,\u201d while Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, proclaimed that \u201cas a matter of economic security, as a matter of national security, America has to beat China in the AI race.\u201d",
      "Yet charges of an AI race are muddied by a lack of an agreed end goal and swirling definitions of AGI. At worst, experts think an unfettered race toward AGI or ASI could lead to widespread catastrophe or even the end of humanity.",
      "But there\u2019s also plenty of skepticism around talk of AGI and ASI and whether it\u2019s primarily for marketing purposes.",
      "Alibaba is one of China\u2019s largest tech companies, known for providing powerful, free AI models \u2014 also called open-source models \u2014 for download. Alibaba\u2019s Qwen model series, a competitor to models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-5 or Anthropic\u2019s Claude, is the most popular open-source AI system in the world.",
      "Wu announced a new series of Qwen models in his speech last week, including a model that combines text, images, video and audio capabilities.",
      "Many observers point out that narratives about a U.S.-China AI race and a resulting sprint to build AI infrastructure serve AI investors by propping up company valuations and increasing their soft power. Alibaba\u2019s stock has soared since Wu\u2019s speech last week, part of a larger $250 billion comeback this year that has made it China\u2019s hottest AI company.",
      "To unlock a powerful, superintelligent future, Wu predicted that large AI models will replace existing operating systems as the link between users, software and computational power. This future network of large AI models will run on cloud computing networks like Alibaba Cloud, he said.",
      "Irene Zhang, a researcher on China\u2019s AI ecosystem and an editor of ChinaTalk, noted the business undertones of Wu\u2019s announcement.",
      "\u201cThis is a vision of AGI and ASI that\u2019s directly based on Alibaba\u2019s business model,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cAlibaba Cloud dominates China\u2019s cloud computing market, and its global market share is now bigger than Oracle\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201cAlibaba\u2019s commercial strategy and its publicly stated views on ASI/AGI are symbiotic.\u201d",
      "Matt Sheehan, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, agreed.",
      "\u201cASI is the ultimate frontier, as far as the discourse goes on AI,\u201d Sheehan said. \u201cIt\u2019s notable that Alibaba set this grandiose goal, but in reality, they\u2019re selling cloud services.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "MANCHESTER, England \u2014 British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was shocked by Thursday\u2019s terrorist attack on a Manchester synagogue during Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Hebrew calendar.",
      "But for many British Jews, this was anything but a shock, rather the culmination of a wave of antisemitism in Britain that was rising before Hamas\u2019 terrorist attack Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel\u2019s subsequent military assault on Gaza \u2014  and has only intensified since.",
      "There has been a rise in anti-Jewish hostility in Britain that predates the attack in Israel and the Gaza war that started three years ago, according to community groups and the people suffering the first-hand effects in the United Kingdom. But the incident at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in Crumpsall has brought the issue of antisemitism to the fore again \u2014 leaving many Jewish people in Britain worried for the safety of their friends and family.",
      "\u201cI just keep thinking about my children,\u201d said Josh Simons, a member of Parliament who represents the Makerfield constituency near Manchester, and whose family fled persecution in Europe for the relative safety of England around a century ago. \u201cI\u2019ve got two young kids and I think everybody in this community will be holding their children tonight that little bit closer.\u201d",
      "He told NBC News on Thursday that the community was feeling \u201cfrightened, scared and hurt.\u201d",
      "Two men, Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66, were killed during the attack on the synagogue.",
      "Greater Manchester Police said Friday that one of them suffered a wound as armed officers attempted to shoot the attacker, Jihad Al-Shamie, who drove into a group of people before stabbing a man. Al-Shamie did not have a firearm. But for many in the Jewish community the attack, which also left three people injured, was the culmination of something that had been festering for some time.",
      "\u201cThis is the day we hoped we would never see, but which deep down, we knew would come,\u201d Britain\u2019s chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, also said in a statement. \u201cFor so long we have witnessed an unrelenting wave of Jew hatred on our streets, on campuses, on social media and elsewhere \u2014 this is the tragic result,\u201d he added.",
      "Since Israel launched its military offensive in the wake of the Hamas-led terrorist attacks on the country, there has been a spike in antisemitic incidents in Britain, according to the Community Security Trust, a charity that coordinates security measures at Jewish institutions and tracks this data. The group defines antisemitism as \u201chatred, bigotry, prejudice or discrimination against Jews,\u201d on its website.",
      "That year, 2023, saw 4,103 antisemitic incidents reported to the CST \u2014 the most on record \u2014 and last year\u2019s 3,528 was the second highest. Swastikas and other graffiti have been daubed on synagogues and other sites, and security has been heightened at Jewish schools.",
      "In the space of a week last month, urine and feces were smeared over seven synagogues and a children\u2019s nursery in Golders Green, a part of north London known for its large Jewish population. \u201cThese repeated attacks have left our community anxious, hurt and increasingly worried,\u201d a spokesperson for the local Shomrim community Jewish patrol group said at the time.",
      "In May, a Jewish-owned business in nearby Stamford Hill, which has a large Orthodox Jewish community, was daubed in red paint and had its windows smashed. Graffiti alleged the firm had links to an Israeli arms manufacturer, but traumatized staff there said this wasn\u2019t the case.",
      "\u201cThere is no doubt that the number of attacks has increased since the Gaza conflict,\u201d Graham Stringer, another member of Parliament serving Blackley and Middleton, another constituency close to Manchester, said  in an interview Friday. \u201cThe Jewish community has been angry and frightened and so, incidentally, has the Muslim community.\u201d",
      "There was an increase in religious hate crimes targeted against Muslims since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas conflict, with 3,866 offenses in the year leading up to March 2024, according to the latest government data. This was up 13% from 3,432 recorded the previous year, the data showed.",
      "Perhaps this is why the 2025 Jewish Landscape Report, an annual global survey, found that 81% of respondents in Britain felt the need to conceal their Jewishness in public.",
      "In a febrile atmosphere, Starmer is now under pressure to reassure British Jews \u2014 who make up just 290,000 of Britain\u2019s 70-million population, according to the last census in 2021 \u2014 that they are safe.",
      "He said Thursday he would do \u201ceverything in my power to guarantee you the security that you deserve, starting with a more visible police presence, protecting your community.\u201d",
      "The necessity of that was evident hours after the incident in Manchester, when two cars drove past the scene displaying Palestinian flags, while some men in balaclavas could be heard muttering about \u201cJews\u201d, according to a Reuters journalist at the scene.",
      "Other observers were dismayed to see pro-Palestinian marches going ahead Thursday evening in Manchester, London and other cities.",
      "There have been regular marches and protests in cities across the country about Israel\u2019s conduct during the war, which will enter its third year Tuesday. Among the crowds, which have on occasion contained tens of thousands, there have been displays of violent antisemitic sentiment, as well as language that conflates enmity toward Israel, Zionism and Jews themselves.",
      "On Friday, protesters said they were supporting an urgent cause, specifically the aid flotilla that was intercepted by the Israeli military en route to Gaza.",
      "But for others \u2014 both in and outside the Jewish community \u2014 it was disappointing not to have a pause in the demonstrations that have often been interpreted as hostile by British Jews.",
      "\u201cI do think that carrying on in this way does feel un-British, it feels wrong,\u201d Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood told the BBC. \u201cIt is important to draw a line between what is happening in the Middle East and what is happening at home.\u201d"

      "Asked if the monarchy would be shifting in a different direction when he becomes king, the Prince of Wales said: \u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say that change is on my agenda. Change for good, and I embrace that and I enjoy that change. I don\u2019t fear it, that\u2019s the bit that excites me is the idea of being able to bring some change.\u201d",
      "William, heir to the throne currently held by King Charles, did not offer any specific changes he would be interested in making and said he did not want \u201coverly radical change,\u201d but said that \u201cif you\u2019re not careful, history can be a real weight and an anchor around you.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s very important that tradition stays, and tradition has a huge part in all of this,\u201d he said in a clip from the upcoming episode. \u201cBut there\u2019s also points where you look at tradition and go, is that still fit for purpose today? Is that still the right thing to do? Are we still doing and having the most impact we could be having?\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Japan could end up with its first female prime minister or its youngest leader in more than a century after a party leadership election on Saturday.",
      "The governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is voting for a new party leader after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced last month that he was stepping down.",
      "The winner is likely to become the new prime minister of Japan, a key U.S. ally and the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy, when parliament votes in mid-October \u2014 though it is not guaranteed since the LDP-led coalition lost its majority in both houses in the past year.",
      "Conservative nationalist Sanae Takaichi, 64, and the more moderate Shinjiro Koizumi, 44, are the front-runners among the five candidates. Yoshimasa Hayashi, 64, who is currently the Japanese government\u2019s top spokesperson, has also surged in public opinion polls and could end up on top.",
      "The new LDP leader will be selected by 295 lawmakers and almost 1 million rank-and-file party members, who will be represented by another 295 votes. The top two candidates are likely to then enter a runoff.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty, but right now, polls suggest that Koizumi is in the pole position,\u201d said Jeff Kingston, a professor of Asian studies and history at Temple University\u2019s Japan campus.",
      "The LDP, which has governed Japan almost uninterrupted since the end of World War II, is doing some \u201csoul-searching,\u201d Kingston said, after election losses spurred by a party corruption scandal as well as public dissatisfaction with the rising cost of living.",
      "Those who think the party hasn\u2019t done enough to root out corruption and needs a \u201creset\u201d are looking for a \u201cfresh face\u201d and to \u201chand the baton to a younger, more charismatic leader\u201d such as Koizumi, Kingston said.",
      "Koizumi, the son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, is a former environment minister but gained more prominence recently as agriculture minister when he was able to rein in runaway prices of rice, a staple Japanese food.",
      "He would be Japan\u2019s youngest leader since Hirobumi Ito, who was just a few months younger than Koizumi when he became the country\u2019s first prime minister in 1885.",
      "Others prefer Takaichi because she was an ally of assassinated former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Japan\u2019s longest-serving leader, whose wing of the LDP has been tarnished by corruption scandals.",
      "\u201cTheir view is that the LDP has to return to its DNA to be the right-wing conservative party, and that Takaichi is the one best positioned to sort of return to the glory of Abe,\u201d Kingston said.",
      "Takaichi, who has a passionate hard-line conservative base among rank-and-file party members, says one of her role models is former British leader Margaret Thatcher.",
      "\u201cShe does project strength in the way that Margaret Thatcher projected strength, and she wants to be that kind of Iron Lady of Japan,\u201d said Jeffrey Hall, a special lecturer in Japanese studies at Kanda University of International Studies.",
      "But some LDP lawmakers consider Takaichi too far right, expressing concern that her nationalistic historical views could undermine relations with China, Japan\u2019s biggest trading partner.",
      "Moderate forces could unite behind another candidate to block Takaichi from winning, much as they did in last year\u2019s leadership race when she lost to Ishiba.",
      "One person who stands to benefit from that scenario is Hayashi, who like Koizumi is Ivy League-educated. Having served in almost every major cabinet post, including foreign minister, Hayashi \u201creally stands for experience and stability,\u201d Hall said.",
      "All of the candidates have talked tough on immigration, an increasingly sensitive issue in Japan, where tourists are coming in record numbers and foreign-born residents make up a growing proportion of the population as the government grapples with labor shortages.",
      "But Takaichi has taken the strongest stances, decrying the rudeness of foreign tourists and accusing them of abusing the famous deer in Nara.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s definitely appealing to the online conservatives who have very strong anti-foreign feelings,\u201d Hall said.",
      "Koizumi, Takaichi and Hayashi all have roughly the same policy toward the U.S., \u201cwhich is keeping the status quo,\u201d he said.",
      "At the moment, the U.S. relationship \u201cis a huge headache for Japan,\u201d and there are signs that the trade deal reached with President Donald Trump in July is \u201cunraveling,\u201d Kingston said.",
      "The impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs has been especially felt by Japan\u2019s crucial auto industry, including brands popular in the U.S. such as Nissan, Honda and Toyota.",
      "Last month the U.S. tariff on cars imported from Japan was lowered to 15% from 27.5%, the same rate the U.S. imposes on almost all Japanese goods under the deal, which has yet to be put in writing. But that is still considerably higher than the previous 2.5%.",
      "The tariffs were lowered in part because Japan pledged $550 billion in U.S. investment, though there are disagreements between Washington and Tokyo as to what form that investment will take and how each country will benefit.",
      "A major challenge for Japan\u2019s next leader will be implementing the trade agreement \u201cin a way that Trump will be satisfied,\u201d Hall said.",
      "\u201cWhoever becomes prime minister will continue Japan\u2019s foreign policy of flattering Trump and being as friendly as possible to Trump,\u201d he said, \u201cand not trying to have any kind of situation where they\u2019ll have open disagreement that could cause Trump to turn on Japan in any way.\u201d"

      "\"This discovery is not only about the treasure itself, but the stories it tells,\u201d Sal Guttuso, the company's director of operations, said in the news release. \"Each coin is a piece of history, a tangible link to the people who lived, worked, and sailed during the Golden Age of the Spanish Empire.\"",
