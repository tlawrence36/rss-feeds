      "BAYREUTH, Germany -- In Wagner's home theater, a twist has been added to the classic opera \u201cDie Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg.\u201d",
      "Instead of Walther joining the guild of master singers and preparing to marry Eva after he wins the song contest, in Bayeuth's new version she grabs the medal out of the young knight's hands, returns it to her father, then leads her future husband offstage for a future forsaking the traditions of their family and city.",
      "\u201cNo thank you. Let's go!\u201d explained soprano Christian Nilsson, who is singing Eva in her role debut. \u201cShe is a strong girl.\u201d",
      "Matthias Davids\u2019 production runs through Aug. 22, emphasizing entertainment with a Hollywood Technicolor look highlighted by an upside-down inflatable cow and a tiny St. Catherine\u2019s Church atop 34 steep steps.",
      "Nilsson's Eva arrives for the Feast of St. John. encased in flowers with additional blossoms in her headdress, carried atop horizontal poles by four men.",
      "\u201cWe were always referring to Eva as the prize cow. We said she is sold like a prize cow,\u201d said Davids, a 63-year-old German director known for his work in theater musicals.",
      "That idea led to the huge heifer, manufactured by a company that makes inflatables and covered with flame retardant coating, according to set designer Andrew Edwards.",
      "Sixtus Beckmesser, the petulant town clerk who loses the song contest to Walther, pulls the plug on the cow, which darkens and sags, during the final oration defending the imperative of German art by the cobbler Hans Sachs.",
      "While Sachs runs to restore the connection \u2014 reinflating the bovine balloon and restoring light \u2014 the young lovers reject him and what he stands for. Townspeople, many wearing conical red caps that give them elf-like looks, shrug their shoulders at the final notes as Sachs and Beckmesser argue upstage.",
      "When \u201cMeistersinger\u201d premiered in 1868, Wagner presented a happy ending in which Walther and Eva joined together and he is admitted to guild. Davids' ending is less jarring than Kasper Holten\u2019s 2017 Covent Garden staging, set in a men's club where Eva is horrified Walther would want to join the misogynistic Meistersingers and runs away in tears.",

      "Davids' contrast was sharp from Barrie Kosky's 2017 production, set partly in Wagner's home of Wahnfried and the Nuremberg trials courtroom, with Walther and Sachs portrayed as Wagner of various ages.",
      "This time Georg Zeppenfeld was a grandfatherly Sachs in an argyle button through sweater vest. Beckmesser, played fussily but without histrionics by Michael Nagy, had a shimmering silver sweater below a cream Trachten jacket, mirror sunglasses and lute transformed to resemble a heart-shaped electric guitar outlined by pink light that gave him an Elvis Presley look. Jongmin Park, an imposing Pogner as Eva's father, was attired in a more flowing robe.",
      "Eva wore a traditional dirndl and Walther, an upstart, a punkish T-shirt. Susanne Hubrich costumed various townspeople to resemble German entertainer Thomas Gottschalk, comedian Loriot, fans of the soccer club Kickers Offenbach and former German Chancellor Angela Merkel.",

      "Born in Melbourne, Australia, Rogers' first foray into performing was in his early twenties and playing drums in a rock band with a group of friends. They weren't successful so Rogers turned to commercial work and modeling to earn some money. When the band dissolved, Rogers decided to give acting a try. After various roles in Australia, he also worked as a DJ and eventually moved to Los Angeles to try to break into Hollywood. He said casting directors were initially turned off by his accent but he eventually landed a two-day role on \u201cGeneral Hospital\u201d in 1980.",
      "\u201cI had no idea at the point how big the show was,\u201d Rogers told fellow \u201cGeneral Hospital\u201d actor Maurice Benard on the YouTube show, \u201cState of Mind with Maurice Benard\u201d in 2022.",
      "\u201cI had no name. I was brought in expressly to beat up the hero, Luke, (played by Anthony Geary), and then disappear,\u201d Rogers said. His first day was half-over when then-executive producer Gloria Monty asked if he would like to stay on. They had no character written for him so for three weeks Monty asked him to just appear in scenes \u201clooking furtive, looking suspicious\u201d until they came up with a storyline. It was decided he would play a spy known as \u201cCK8\u201d and eventually he was given the name Robert Scorpio. The character would remain a fixture in Port Charles for the rest of Rogers' life, even when he wasn't a current cast member.",
      "Scorpio's on again/off again romance with Emma Samms' character, Holly Sutton, remained a favorite among fans. Scorpio also had a romance, and many storylines with another spy, Anna Devane, played by Finola Hughes. Scorpio and Devane shared a daughter, Robin, played by Kimberly McCullough. Samms returned to the show for a stint last fall where it was revealed that Scorpio was the father of her adult daughter, Sasha Gilmore (played by Sofia Mattson.)",

      "Filmmaker Kate Beecroft tells the story of some real Badlands cowgirls in the independent film \u201cEast of Wall.\u201d",
      "Filmmaker Kate Beecroft points her lens toward the real cowgirls of the Badlands in the lyrical new film \u201cEast of Wall.\u201d",
      "The film blends fact and fiction to tell a story about the working women of South Dakota, skilled riders and trainers with ranching and rodeo in their blood who also can't seem to catch a break. There are a few Hollywood actors in the mix, including Jennifer Ehle as a hard living grandmother with a lifetime of regrets as well as some nuggets of wisdom and Scoot McNairy as an out-of-towner who wants to acquire the land, but most of the cast are non-actors playing themselves. The film won an audience award earlier this year at the Sundance Film Festival.",
      "At the heart of \u201cEast of Wall,\u201d now playing in select theaters, is Tabatha Zimiga, a South Dakota native whose ability to tame wild horses is the stuff of legend in the area. In the film, the horses she rescues and rehabilitates are sold at auctions and often accepted for far less than what they\u2019re worth. She needs the money. There are bills to pay on the ranch and many mouths to feed (not just her own kids, but others from around the town who come to her for safety and shelter when their own caretakers stop providing).",
      "Tabatha is also living with new and old traumas, from the generational agony of abuse to the more recent death of her husband, the shocking circumstances of which are withheld for some time. But the effects of the loss are still felt, especially for their daughter Porshia (played by her real-life daughter Porshia Zimiga), whose grief is threatening to turn into hate of her mother. Teenage Porshia provides the poetic voiceovers, in which she talks about riding, her mother and, most effectively, the land. It's reminiscent of Linda Manz\u2019s narration in \u201cDays of Heaven.\u201d",
      "\u201cEast of Wall\u201d is best when it\u2019s capturing the landscapes and the girls in action, riding and filming energetic TikToks of their friends racing cars on horseback. Some have suggested that \u201cEast of Wall\u201d might have been stronger as a documentary. These women are vibrant and authentic and don't look like anyone we see in the movies these days, with real bodies and imperfect skin, heads half-shaved, tattoos everywhere and the ability to really, really ride \u2014 no stunt team required. And they have stories to tell, many of them unhappy, as we see in one of the most moving non-action scenes involving a group of mothers speaking candidly about their lives and their regrets.",
      "The real-life drama of financial instability is compelling and likely rooted in truth; however, the introduction of McNairy\u2019s suspect Texan feels like a narrative contrivance and drama for drama\u2019s sake. He offers to buy the ranch and let them live and work as usual, just for him now instead of themselves. These are the kind of scenes that remind you that the filmmakers, despite all their best intentions and care, are, in essence, also interlopers in this world.",

People come up and look at the window all the time. I mean it\u2019s a real destination. Billy Joel is a real superstar, and he is a hometown boy, so it\u2019s really unfortunate.\"",
      "The motorcycles that were in the shop have already been moved out. But it has been open on recent weekends selling new, used and vintage motorcycle parts that were still in stock there.",
      "Joel's enthusiasm for motorcycles dates back decades. In 1982, he was riding a motorcycle on Long Island when he was struck by a car that ran a red light, injuring his left thumb and dislocating his right wrist. He spent about a month in the hospital. He has also ridden motorcycles in various benefits for 9/11 first responders, breast cancer and other causes over the years.",

Biden's remarks were widely disseminated on social media and reported by media outlets around the world, causing the first lady \u201cto suffer overwhelming financial and reputational harm,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Biden made the Epstein comments during a sprawling interview in which he lashed out at \u201celites\u201d and others in the Democratic Party he says undermined his father before he dropped out of last year's presidential campaign.",
      "\u201cEpstein introduced Melania to Trump. The connections are, like, so wide and deep,\u201d Biden said in one of the comments Trump disputes. Biden attributed the claim to author Michael Wolff, whom Trump disparaged in June as a \u201cThird Rate Reporter.\u201d He has accused Wolff of making up stories to sell books.",
      "The first lady's threats echo a favored strategy of her husband, who has aggressively used litigation to go after critics. Public figures like the Trumps face a high bar to succeed in a defamation lawsuit.",

      "After getting out of the scripted TV business in 2021 for reality TV and sports coverage, USA Network is returning to air scripted originals with the legal drama \u201cThe Rainmaker.\"",
      "Since 2021, the USA Network had stacked its lineup with reality shows and sports, entirely forgoing original, scripted programming. Fans of \"Suits\u201d, \u201cWhite Collar\u201d and \u201cMonk\u201d were left with only memories of those shows' case-of-the-week storytelling. But on Friday, the network returns to scripted TV with the legal thriller \u201cThe Rainmaker.\u201d",
      "If the title sounds familiar, it's because it\u2019s based on the 1995 novel by John Grisham, which was first adapted into the 1997 Matt Damon-starring film directed by Francis Ford Coppola. In this \u201cRainmaker,\u201d British actor Milo Callaghan plays Rudy Baylor. It's the first leading role for Callaghan, who had previously played recurring characters in shows like HBO's \u201cDune: Prophecy\" and Starz\u2019s \u201cThe Spanish Princess.\u201d",
      "Baylor is fresh out of law school and about to start working at the largest law firm in the state, run by Leo F. Drummond (John Slattery). On his first day, Baylor gets fired after challenging Drummond in a meeting. Desperate for work, he takes a job at a small ambulance-chasing firm that works out of a former taco joint. His boss is Jocelyn \u201cBruiser\u201d Stone (Lana Parrilla, in a gender swap from the film where Mickey Rourke had the role). She\u2019s smart, confident and not afraid to use her sex appeal to get what she wants. Rudy\u2019s first big case pits him against the big, fancy law firm that let him go \u2014 and his girlfriend who still works there.",
      "Callaghan told The Associated Press about learning legalese while doing a Memphis accent and familiarizing himself with the source material. Answers are edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "CALLAGHAN: I watched it when I got cast. Matt Damon is somebody that every young actor would look up to. I wanted to be aware of the work that he did. I mean, it was a Coppola movie as well, so I was excited to see it. And then I gave it maybe like 20 minutes' thought and focused on the script because it is different and I think we have 10 hours of television to explore this character. We go on a windier road than the movie.",
      "CALLAGHAN: Yes. It\u2019s a slow-paced thriller, really, but fantastic. And there\u2019s this chunk, it must be about 100 pages, of him just preparing for this case for months and months and months. So I never wanted it to feel like it was off-the-hand genius. It felt like this is a situation that has to be honored to a certain extent. Like, you can be a fantastic lawyer, but you don\u2019t get there without grinding and grafting. We had great scenes where we were working late into the night.",

      "CALLAGHAN: Consistent work with a great dialogue coach. I remember I got there on my first day and I was running lines with P.J. Byrne, who plays Deck, and he\u2019s kind of looking at me funny. He\u2019s like, \u201cWhy are you talking like that?\u201d I was like, \"What do you mean? Because we start filming in three days.\" I was pronouncing everything phonetically because that was the way I learned. I had to really work on paring it back into a place that felt so natural. For a movie, you might get away with it, but for 10 hours of television, it just has to be light, it has to be quick, it has to be at your fingertips.",
      "CALLAGHAN: \u201cNorth City Hospital.\u201d It was the hardest thing. I was like, 'Why did you call it this?\" I got all this legalese down and then \u201cNorth City Hospital\u201d would shoot me in the foot every time.",
      "CALLAGHAN: I went through major trials, like the whole O.J. Simpson murder trial and the Gwyneth Paltrow trial. And also obscure trials. I studied attorneys and their patterns of speech and the way they address the court. We don't really have the same kind of pop star element to the legal system of like, \u201cThat\u2019s the guy who represented this person and that person.\u201d Studying that is fascinating.",

It made $70 million internationally.",

    "story": [
      "Global talks to slash plastic production and the toxic chemicals used to produce plastic products fell apart in Geneva this week",
      "Talks aimed at a global treaty to cut plastic pollution fizzled in Geneva this week, with no agreement to meaningfully reduce the harms to human health and the environment that come with the millions of tons of plastic water bottles, food containers and packaging produced today.",
      "Though as many as 100 countries sought caps on production, powerful oil-producing nations like Saudi Arabia and the United States stood against them. They argued the caps were unnecessary and a threat to their economies and industries.",
      "That means any progress continues to depend on efforts to improve recycling, reuse and product design \u2014 the very things that powerful nations argued were sufficient to address the problem without resorting to production cuts.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about how successful those efforts have been.",
      "The world makes more than 400 million tons of new plastic each year, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates that could increase by about 70% by 2040 without meaningful change. A great deal of that ends up in landfills or, worse, the environment.",
      "Pollution isn't the only problem. Plastics, made almost entirely from fossil fuels, are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Plastics generated 3.4% \u2014 or 1.8 billion tons \u2014 of planet-warming emissions across the globe in 2019, the United Nations says.",
      "Not very.",
      "It's notoriously difficult to recycle plastics; only 6% of what's made gets recycled, according to the OECD. That's largely because different kinds of plastic cannot be recycled together. They have different chemical compositions, making it costly and time-consuming, and requiring a lot of manual sorting.",
      "\u201cThere are many different colors of plastics, many different types of plastics called polymers, and 16,000 to 17,000 different chemicals used to make plastics, so by design, plastics are not easily recyclable,\" said Judith Enck, president of Beyond Plastics, an organization that works to cut plastic pollution.",
      "Experts say plastic is different from materials like paper, cardboard, metal and glass, which all get reused at much higher rates. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates glass recycling at about 31%, and things like steel cans at about 71%. As much as 64% of paper and 74% of cardboard get recycled, according to the American Forest & Paper Association.",
      "But \u201cIf you just think of your own home or apartment, you might have a bright orange hard plastic detergent container on top of your washing machine, and then you might have a plastic bag,\u201d Enck said. \u201cThose two things cannot get recycled together.\"",
      "The plastics industry says innovations in material science are helping to incorporate more recycled plastics into products and enable more plastic products to be recyclable. Ross Eisenberg, president of America\u2019s Plastic Makers, noted the need for an \u201call-of-the-above approach.\u201d",
      "He said this also includes upgrading recycling infrastructure or improving sorting to capture more used plastics. This also means making recycling more accessible and helping consumers know what can and can\u2019t go in the recycling bin.",
      "But there are a lot of limitations to this.",
      "Depending on consumers for accurate pre-sorting is a lot to ask. And cities may hesitate to make costly infrastructure improvements to their recycling programs if there is little financial incentive or market for the recycled material.",
      "\"Local recycling facilities, or markets for the recycled material, don\u2019t always exist. Where the collection and processing infrastructure does exist, the recycling plants are essentially plastic production facilities, with the same air, water, and soil pollution problems that are harmful to local residents,\" said Holly Kaufman, director of The Plastics & Climate Project and senior fellow at World Resources Institute.",

      "California is currently suing oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil, alleging deception about the possibilities of plastic recycling.",
      "Because of this, Kaufman says, \u201cThe aim should be to significantly reduce plastic production, use, and waste, not recycle more.\u201d",
      "\u201cReuse means creating packaging or products designed to be used multiple times, like refillable containers, or more durable zippered bags that can be washed and refilled many times, extending their lifespan and reducing waste,\u201d Eisenberg, of America's Plastic Makers, said.",
      "Experts say reuse is extremely important, but reusable products shouldn\u2019t necessarily be used for consumables because of the risk of microplastics.",
      "Redesigning plastic often means making it easier to recycle. That can be using one material in packaging instead of several, or printing labels directly onto a container rather than using a separate one that is glued on, but that is more complex.",
      "Alternatives to plastics could also be made out of sustainable, less harmful and even regenerative materials, such as seaweed, Kaufman said. There has been progress on this front, but most solutions have not scaled up yet.",

      "Republican lawmakers are blaming Canada for not preventing and containing wildfires, whose smoke has fouled the air in several states this year",
      "The sternly worded statements and letters are filled with indignation and outrage: Republican U.S. lawmakers say Canada has done too little to contain wildfires and smoke that have fouled the air in several states this summer.",
      "\u201cInstead of enjoying family vacations at Michigan\u2019s beautiful lakes and campgrounds, for the third summer in a row, Michiganders are forced to breathe hazardous air as a result of Canada\u2019s failure to prevent and control wildfires,\u201d read a statement last week from the state\u2019s GOP congressional delegation, echoing similar missives from Republicans in Iowa, New York, North Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin.",
      "They\u2019ve demanded more forest thinning, prescribed burns and other measures to prevent fires from starting. They've warned the smoke is hurting relations between the countries and suggested the U.S. could make it an issue in tariff talks.",
      "But what they haven't done is acknowledge the role of climate change \u2014 a glaring and shortsighted omission, according to climate scientists. It also ignores the outsized U.S. contribution to heat-trapping gases from burning fossil fuels like coal and gas that cause more intense heat waves and droughts, which in turn set the stage for more destructive wildfires, scientists say.",
      "\u201cIf anything, Canada should be blaming the U.S. for their increased fires,\u201d said Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Cape Cod, Massachusetts.",
      "On Tuesday, the Canadian government announced almost $46 million in funding for wildfire prevention and risk assessment research projects. But Corey Hogan, parliamentary secretary to the federal energy and natural resources minister, said international cooperation is needed.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no people that want to do more about wildfires than Canadians,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cBut I think this also underlines the international challenges that are brought on by climate change ... we need to globally tackle this problem.\u201d",
      "The country has \u201cbeen fighting wildfires in this country at unprecedented rates since 2023,\u201d when Canada saw its largest wildfire on record, said Ken McMullen, president of the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs. This year\u2019s first fire started in April, one of the earliest on record, and 2025 is now the second-worst year.",
      "As of Thursday, more than 700 wildfires were burning across the country, two-thirds of them out of control, with more than 28,000 square miles (72,520 square kilometers) burned in 4,400 wildfires so far this year, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. That's almost five times the surface area that's burned so far in the U.S. this year. Most wildfires are started by people, sometimes on purpose but mostly by mistake, though McMullen said lightning is the culprit in many of Canada's fires, especially in remote areas.",
      "McMullen said he has no interest in debating the role of climate change, but data show that something has changed. Sloughs and basins have dried up and water that once lapped at people\u2019s back doors in Canada\u2019s lake communities now is often hundreds of feet away.",
      "\u201cPeople can make up their own mind as to why that is,\u201d he said. \u201cBut something clearly has changed.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax \u2014 a belief echoed by many in the GOP \u2014 and his administration has worked to dismantle and defund federal climate science and data collection, with little to no pushback from Republicans in Congress.",
      "He\u2019s proposed to revoke the scientific finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare \u2014 the central basis for U.S. climate change action. He's declared a national energy emergency to expedite fossil fuel development, canceled grants for renewable energy projects and ordered the U.S. to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, aimed at limiting long-term global warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above preindustrial levels.",

      "Many of President Donald Trump's picks to be federal judges have revealed anti-abortion views, been associated with anti-abortion groups or defended abortion restrictions",
      "CHICAGO -- One called abortion a \u201cbarbaric practice.\u201d Another referred to himself as a \u201czealot\u201d for the anti-abortion movement. Several have played prominent roles in defending their state's abortion restrictions in court and in cases that have had national impact, including on access to medication abortion.",
      "As President Donald Trump pushes the Senate to confirm his federal judicial nominees, a review by The Associated Press shows that roughly half of them have revealed anti-abortion views, been associated with anti-abortion groups or defended abortion restrictions.",
      "Trump has offered shifting positions on the issue while indicating he wants to leave questions of abortion access to the states. But his court nominees will have lifetime appointments and be in position to roll back abortion access long after the Republican president leaves the White House.",
      "Bernadette Meyler, a professor of constitutional law at Stanford University, said judicial nominations \u201care a way of federally shaping the abortion question without going through Congress or making a big, explicit statement.\u201d",
      "\"It\u2019s a way to cover up a little bit what is happening in the abortion sphere compared to legislation or executive orders that may be more visible, dramatic and spark more backlash,\u201d she said.",
      "Of the 17 judicial nominees so far in Trump's second term, at least eight have argued in favor of abortion restrictions or against expanded abortion access. No such records could be found for the other nine, nor did the AP review find evidence that any of Trump's judicial nominees support increased access to abortion.",
      "\"Every nominee of the President represents his promises to the American people and aligns with the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s landmark ruling,\" a White House spokesman, Harrison Fields, said in a statement that referenced the 2022 decision overturning the constitutional right to abortion established in Roe v. Wade. \u201cThe Democrats\u2019 extreme position on abortion was rejected in November in favor of President Trump\u2019s commonsense approach, which allows states to decide, supports the sanctity of human life, and prevents taxpayer funding of abortion.\u201d",
      "Trump's first term also had an enduring impact on the courts, appointing 234 judges. By the end of that term, more than one-quarter of active federal judges were nominated by Trump, including three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade.",
      "In his second term, all but five of his 17 nominees are from states that went for Trump in 2024 and where Republicans have pushed severe abortion restrictions. Among them, four nominees are from Missouri and five are from Florida.",
      "Here is a look at the nominees who have tried to reduce abortion access or have advocated for restrictions. They did not respond to requests for comment:",
      "\u2014 Whitney Hermandorfer, who has been confirmed to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, has built much of her relatively short career as a lawyer around challenging former President Joe Biden\u2019s policies related to abortion and transgender rights. She challenged a federal law requiring employers to provide workers with reasonable accommodations to get abortion care, as well as Title X regulations that required providers who receive funding through the program to give information about abortions to patients if asked.",
      "Hermandorfer defended Tennessee\u2019s abortion ban, one of the strictest in the country, in court and tried to dismiss a lawsuit from doctors seeking clarification on exemptions to the ban. She said abortion deserves special scrutiny because \u201cthis is the only medical procedure that terminates a life.\u201d",
      "\u2014 Maria Lanahan, a district court nominee in Missouri, helped write the state's complaint in a lawsuit that had sweeping national implications for access to medication abortion. The case challenged the FDA approval of the abortion pill mifepristone despite decades of evidence showing the drug is safe and effective.",
      "The lawyer supported Missouri's effort to strip Planned Parenthood of state Medicaid funding and defended the state's abortion ban after a group of clergy sued, arguing it violated the state constitution\u2019s protections for religious freedom.",
      "\u2014 Jordan Pratt, a nominee for the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, called abortion a \u201cbarbaric practice\u201d and \u201cone of the most severe invasions of personal rights imaginable\u201d in an amicus brief supporting Florida's 15-week abortion ban. The state now bans the procedure at six weeks.",
      "In 2025, Pratt struck down a Florida law that created a judicial waiver program for minors seeking to have abortions without parental consent. The lawyer also worked for the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal organization that opposes abortion and has sued to reverse the FDA approval of mifepristone.",

      "He also stepped into a prominent role in the fight over abortion rights in the state after Missouri voters approved an abortion rights amendment in 2024. That amendment did not immediately override state laws. It left it up to abortion rights groups to ask courts to knock down abortion restrictions they believed were now unconstitutional. During the ensuing legal battles, Divine represented the state in defending a host of abortion restrictions.",
      "\u2014 Chad Meredith, Trump's nominee to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, defended the state's abortion ban and other restrictions while he was the state's chief deputy general counsel. That included a law requiring doctors to perform ultrasounds and describe images to abortion patients.",
      "\u2014 Bill Mercer, a Republican state lawmaker in Montana who is nominated for a U.S. District Court judgeship in the state, has repeatedly supported anti-abortion bills. Those include ones that sought to ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy; require a 24-hour waiting period and mandatory ultrasounds for abortion patients; require parental notification for minors to get an abortion; prohibit the use of state funding for abortions; prohibit certain insurance policies from covering abortions; and restrict what types of medical professionals can dispense medication abortion.",
      "\u2014 Jennifer Mascott, a lawyer in the White House Counsel\u2019s Office and a Trump nominee to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, has spoken repeatedly about abortion law in panels and interviews.",
      "After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Mascott in an interview on \u201cFox News Live\u201d disagreed with the argument that the decision undermined the court\u2019s legitimacy. She said abortion issues are \u201cmore appropriately decided\u201d by the states, elected officials in Congress and people in their local communities.",

    "story": [
      "Reusable menstrual products, including cups, discs and period underwear, have gained traction as a cost-effective, long-lasting, environmental alternative to single-use products",
      "It was six months ago that Selin Celikoyar bought her last tampon and switched to a reusable menstrual disc.",
      "\"I had already been wary of tampons from an environmental perspective and also from a biological perspective. I felt that they were very wasteful and expensive to consistently keep buying,\" she said.",
      "The flexible discs and other reusable menstrual products are gaining traction as alternatives to the billions of single-use pads and tampons that get tossed into landfills every year. Products such as the discs, silicone cups and period underwear can be reused for years, so they\u2019re cost-effective and long-lasting in addition to helping people reduce waste. The popularity of the reusable alternatives has grown since the pandemic, when it was easier to experiment with period products in the privacy of a home bathroom, according to women's health experts.",
      "Celikoyar said she used tampons and pads for years because those are the options she grew up knowing about. But when she saw her friend make the switch to a menstrual disc, she decided to try it too.",
      "\u201cThe experience has been such a game changer,\u201d she said.",
      "About 12 billion disposable pads and 7 billion tampons go into U.S. landfills every year, according to Dr. Luwam Semere, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Kaiser Permanente Santa Clara. Pads are mostly plastic. Once they're in the landfill, they take up to 800 years to degrade, according to the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Single-use pads and tampons are by far the most popular period products. Women's health expert Dr. Navya Mysore said that's not because they're better, they're just usually the first options kids are shown.",
      "\u201cIt was often like, \u2018What did your mom use? What did your grandma use?\u2019 And that\u2019s how you were introduced into period hygiene,\u201d said Mysore, a primary care physician based in New York City.",
      "The most popular is the menstrual cup, which gets inserted much like a tampon. The discs get inserted farther in, so they don't interrupt intercourse. Both can hold several times more than a tampon and can stay inserted for up to 12 hours, instead of the four to eight hours recommended for tampons. Semere also said the risk of Toxic Shock Syndrome commonly associated with tampons is much lower with menstrual cups and discs.",
      "The cons? The products require some technique to put them in right, and doing it wrong can get messy. The cups and discs also have to be cleaned regularly with soap and water.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to do that if you\u2019re at work and you\u2019re in a shared, public restroom. It\u2019s not the most convenient,\u201d said Mysore.",
      "Cups prevent leakage by creating a suction, so people who use intrauterine devices for contraception risk dislodging them if they pull out a menstrual cup without breaking the seal.",
      "The placement of discs, which don\u2019t use suction, can also take some getting used to.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s high up there, you don\u2019t feel it, but it can be sometimes harder for women to pull them out,\u201d said Dr. Annemieke van Eijk, an epidemiologist with the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.",

      "But for Celikoyar, the advantages of the discs outweighed the drawbacks. She said that longer changing window has gotten her through a back-to-back concert and red-eye flight without any concern.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an ease of use there for the modern woman that is significantly better than traditional methods,\u201d she said.",
      "Menstrual cups and discs typically cost between $15 and $40 and come in different shapes and sizes. They're available online and at pharmacies and big box stores.",
      "\u201cIdeally, you would like to experiment a bit with what type of cup works best for you. And the cost can be kind of prohibitive to do that,\u201d van Eijk said.",
      "A reusable product can help save money over the long term. Celikoyar estimates that she was using three tampons every day for seven days, or about 20 per month. With tampons costing 20 to 25 cents each, someone who switched to a reusable product would likely break even after a few months.",
      "For people who prefer pads, the most common reusable option is period underwear, which is comparable to regular-looking underwear with an extra absorbent lining.",
      "\u201cThose are nice because we do see people getting irritation from pad use,\" said Semere. \"Because of the different materials that are in the disposable pads.\u201d",
      "The downside, just like with pads, is the inability to tell when it's absorbed all that it can.",
      "Mysore said that's why some of her patients use the underwear as a backup, and pair them cups, discs or tampons.",
      "\u201cYou can sort of mix and match different period products, depending on how heavy your flow is and what your period is like for you,\u201d she said.",

      "Tensions between the neighboring countries escalated Tuesday, when Peruvian police arrested three Colombian men who were on the island doing land surveying work.

      "The arrest of the two Colombians marks the third binational incident in the area since Petro denied Peru\u2019s jurisdiction over Santa Rosa Island on Aug. 5.

      "Twenty years ago, Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip, dismantling 21 Jewish settlements and pulling out its forces",
      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- Twenty years ago, Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip, dismantling 21 Jewish settlements and pulling out its forces. The Friday anniversary of the start of the landmark disengagement comes as Israel is mired in a nearly 2-year war with Hamas that has devastated the Palestinian territory and means it is likely to keep troops there long into the future.",
      "Israel\u2019s disengagement, which also included removing four settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, was then-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon\u2019s controversial attempt to jump-start negotiations with the Palestinians. But it bitterly divided Israeli society and led to the empowerment of Hamas, with implications that continue to reverberate today.",
      "The emotional images of Jews being ripped from their homes by Israeli soldiers galvanized Israel\u2019s far-right and settler movements. The anger helped them organize and increase their political influence, accounting in part for the rise of hard-line politicians like National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich.",
      "On Thursday, Smotrich boasted of a settlement expansion plan east of Jerusalem that will \u201cbury\u201d the idea of a future Palestinian state.",
      "For Palestinians, even if they welcomed the disengagement, it didn\u2019t end Israel\u2019s control over their lives.",
      "Soon after, Hamas won elections in 2006, then drove out the Palestinian Authority in a violent takeover. Israel and Egypt imposed a closure on the territory, controlling entry and exit of goods and people. Though its intensity varied over the years, the closure helped impoverish the population and entrenched a painful separation from Palestinians in the West Bank.",
      "Israel captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians claim all three territories for a future independent state.",
      "Israel couldn\u2019t justify the military or economic cost of maintaining the heavily fortified settlements in Gaza, explained Kobi Michael, a senior researcher at the Misgav Institute and the Institute for National Security Studies think tanks. There were around 8,000 Israeli settlers and 1.5 million Palestinians in Gaza in 2005.",
      "\u201cThere was no chance for these settlements to exist or flourish or become meaningful enough to be a strategic anchor,\u201d he said. By contrast, there are more than 500,000 Israeli settlers in the West Bank, most living in developed settlement blocs that have generally received more support from Israeli society, Michael said. Most of the world considers the settlements illegal under international law.",
      "Because Israel withdrew unilaterally, without any coordination with the Palestinian Authority, it enhanced Hamas' stature among Palestinians in Gaza.",
      "\u201cThis contributed to Hamas\u2019 win in the elections in 2006, because they leveraged it and introduced it as a very significant achievement,\u201d Michael said. \u201cThey saw it as an achievement of the resistance and a justification for the continuation of the armed resistance.\u201d",
      "Footage of the violence between Israeli settlers and Israeli soldiers also created an \u201copen wound\u201d in Israeli society, Michael said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think any government will be able to do something like that in the future,\u201d he said. That limits any flexibility over settlements in the West Bank if negotiations over a two-state solution with the Palestinians ever resume.",
      "\u201cDisengagement will never happen again, this is a price we\u2019re paying as a society, and a price we\u2019re paying politically,\u201d he said.",
      "Anita Tucker, now 79, was part of the first nine Jewish families that moved to the Gaza Strip in 1976. She and her husband and their three kids lived in an Israeli army outpost near what is today Deir al-Balah, while the settlement of Netzer Hazoni was constructed.",
      "Originally from Brooklyn, she started a farm growing vegetables in the harsh, tall sand dunes. At first relations were good with their Palestinian neighbors, she said, and they worked hard to build their home and a \u201cbeautiful community.\u201d She had two more children, and three chose to stay and raise their families in Netzer Hazoni.",
      "She can still recall the moment, 20 years ago, when 1,000 Israeli soldiers arrived at the gate to the settlement to remove the approximately 400 residents. Some of her neighbors lit their houses on fire in protest.",
      "\u201cObviously it was a mistake to leave. The lives of the Arabs became much worse, and the lives of the Jews became much, much worse, with rockets and Oct. 7,\u201d she said, referring to the decades of rockets fired from Gaza into Israel and the date in 2023 of the Hamas attack that launched the ongoing war.",

      "After Israel\u2019s withdrawal 20 years ago, many Palestinians described Gaza as an \u201copen-air prison.\u201d They had control on the inside \u2013 under a Hamas government that some supported but some saw as heavy-handed and brutal. But ultimately, Israel had a grip around the territory.",
      "Many Palestinians believe Sharon carried out the withdrawal so Israel could focus on cementing its control in the West Bank through settlement building.",
      "Now some believe more direct Israeli occupation is returning to Gaza. After 22 months of war, Israeli troops control more than 75% of Gaza, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks of maintaining security control long term after the war.",
      "Amjad Shawa, the director of the Palestinian NGO Network, said he doesn\u2019t believe Netanyahu will repeat Sharon\u2019s full withdrawal. Instead, he expects the military to continue controlling large swaths of Gaza through \u201cbuffer zones.\u201d",

      "There were an average of 10 attacks per day against Israeli settlers and soldiers, including rockets, roadside bombs big enough to destroy a tank, tunnels to attack Israeli soldiers and military positions, and frequent gunfire.",
      "\u201cBringing a school bus of kids from one place to another required a military escort,\u201d said Harel. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a future. People paint it as how wonderful it was there, but it wasn\u2019t wonderful.\u201d",
      "Harel says the decision to evacuate Israeli settlements from the Gaza Strip was the right one, but that Israel missed crucial opportunities.",
      "Most egregious, he said, was a unilateral withdrawal without obtaining any concessions from the Palestinians in Gaza or the Palestinian Authority.",
      "He also sharply criticized Israel\u2019s policy of containment toward Hamas after disengagement. There were short but destructive conflicts over the years between the two sides, but otherwise the policy gave Hamas \u201can opportunity to do whatever they wanted.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe had such a blind spot with Hamas, we didn\u2019t see them morph from a terror organization into an organized military, with battalions and commanders and infrastructure,\u201d he said.",
      "The Oct. 7 attack, Israel\u2019s largest military intelligence failure to date, was not a result of the disengagement, said Harel. \u201cThe main issue is what we did in the 18 years in between.\u201d",

      "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has warned Pakistan that India will punish its archrival neighbor if there are future attacks on India",
      "NEW DELHI -- Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned Pakistan that India will punish its neighbor if there are future attacks on India as he marked 78 years of independence from British colonial rule.",
      "Modi\u2019s remarks Friday come three months after nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan engaged in four days of intense fighting, their worst clash in decades.",
      "Modi addressed the country from New Delhi\u2019s 17th-century, Mughal-era Red Fort, saying India has established a \u201cnew normal\u201d that does not differentiate between \u201cterrorists\u201d and those who support terrorism. He said he would not tolerate what he called Islamabad\u2019s \u201cnuclear blackmail.\"",
      "\u201cIndia has decided that it will not tolerate nuclear threats. For a long time, nuclear blackmail had been going on but this blackmail will not be tolerated now,\u201d Modi said.",
      "Pakistan previously has rejected India\u2019s statements about nuclear blackmail as provocative and inflammatory.",
      "India celebrates its Independence Day one day after Pakistan. The two states came into existence as a result of the bloody partition of British India in 1947. The process sparked some of the worst communal violence the world has seen and left hundreds of thousands dead. It triggered one of the largest human migrations in history and some 12 million people fled their homes.",
      "India and Pakistan exchanged tit-for-tat military strikes in May that brought them to the brink of a war. The fighting between the two countries was sparked by an April massacre by gunmen in Indian-controlled Kashmir that killed 26 people, mostly Hindu tourists. India blamed the attack on Pakistan-backed militants. Islamabad denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation.",
      "Days after the massacre, India launched strikes on Pakistan and said it had hit nine \u201cterrorist infrastructure\u201d sites.",
      "\u201cTerror infrastructure was turned to rubble,\u201d Modi said in his speech Friday.",
      "Pakistan responded by sending waves of drones into India, as well as missile and artillery bombardments. Dozens of people were killed on both sides until a ceasefire was reached May 10 after U.S. mediation.",
      "Pakistan immediately claimed it shot down six Indian aircraft during the clashes, including a French-made Rafale fighter. India acknowledged some losses but did not provide details.",
      "Last week, India\u2019s air force chief said India shot down five Pakistani fighter jets and one other military aircraft during clashes in the first such public claim by India. Pakistan rejected it, saying both sides should open their aircraft inventories to independent verification.",

The treaty, which India suspended after the April massacre, allows sharing of the Indus River that runs about 2,897 kilometers (1,800 miles) through South Asia and is a lifeline for both countries.",
      "\u201cRivers from India were irrigating the lands of enemies while my country\u2019s farmers and land faced a deficiency of water,\" Modi said. \u201cIndia has now decided that blood and water will not flow together.\"",
      "Pakistan has said any effort by India to stop or divert the water from flowing into Pakistan would be considered an \u201cact of war.\u201d",
      "Modi did not directly mention U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on India in his Independence Day speech but said he would not compromise on the agriculture sector, one of the main sticking points in trade negotiations with the U.S.",
      "Earlier this month, Trump imposed a 25% penalty on India in addition to 25% tariffs for buying oil and weapons from Russia.",

      "Since then, they have imposed their interpretation of Islamic law on daily life, including sweeping restrictions on women and girls, based on edicts from their leader Hibatullah Akhundzada.",
      "Akhundzada, who is seldom seen in public, said in a statement that Afghans had endured hardships and made sacrifices for almost 50 years so that Islamic law, or Sharia, could be established. Sharia had saved people from \u201ccorruption, oppression, usurpation, drugs, theft, robbery, and plunder.\u201d",
      "His statement was shared on the social platform X by the Taliban\u2019s chief spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid.",
      "\u201cThese are great divine blessings that our people should not forget and, during the commemoration of Victory Day (Aug. 15), express great gratitude to Allah Almighty so that the blessings will increase,\u201d said Akhundzada. \u201cIf, against God\u2019s will, we fail to express gratitude for blessings and are ungrateful for them, we will be subjected to the severe punishment of Allah Almighty.\u201d",
      "He also instructed the Cabinet and ministers to drop the word \u201cacting\u201d from their job titles, signifying the permanence of a Taliban administration in Afghanistan and the lack of challengers to their rule.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s new liberal president, Lee Jae Myung, said Friday he will seek to restore a 2018 military agreement with North Korea aimed at reducing border tensions and urged Pyongyang to respond to Seoul\u2019s efforts to rebuild trust and revive dialogue.",
      "Speaking on the 80th anniversary of Korea\u2019s liberation from Japanese colonial rule, Lee\u2019s overture came amid soaring tensions fueled by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s nuclear ambitions and deepening ties with Russia over the war in Ukraine.",
      "The 2018 military agreement, reached during a brief period of diplomacy between Kim and South Korea\u2019s former liberal President Moon Jae-in, created buffer zones on land and sea and no-fly zones above the border to prevent clashes.",
      "South Korea\u2019s previous conservative government suspended the deal in 2024, citing tensions over North Korea\u2019s launches of trash-laden balloons toward the South, and moved to resume frontline military activities and propaganda campaigns. The step came after North Korea had already declared it would no longer abide by the agreement.",
      "\u201cTo prevent accidental clashes between South and North Korea and to build military trust, we will take proactive, gradual steps to restore the (2018) Sept. 19 military agreement,\u201d Lee said in a televised speech.",
      "Lee said his government affirms \u201cour respect for the North\u2019s current system\u201d and that the wealthier South \u201cwill not pursue any form of unification by absorption and has no intention of engaging in hostile acts.\u201d",
      "Lee said South Korea remains committed to an international push to denuclearize North Korea and urged Pyongyang to resume dialogue with Washington and Seoul. Amid a prolonged diplomatic stalemate with its rivals, Kim\u2019s government has made clear it has no intention of giving up the weapons it sees as its strongest guarantee of survival and would reject any future talks on denuclearization.",
      "\u201cDenuclearization is a complex and difficult task that cannot be resolved quickly,\u201d Lee said. \u201cHowever, inter-Korean and U.S.-North Korea dialogue as well as international cooperation will help us approach a peaceful resolution.\u201d",
      "Japan\u2019s defeat in World War II liberated Korea from colonial rule, but the peninsula was then divided into a U.S.-backed, capitalist South and a Soviet-supported, socialist North \u2014 a separation cemented by the devastating 1950\u201353 Korean War.",
      "Lee, whose speech came days before he plans to travel to Japan for a summit with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, took a conciliatory tone toward Tokyo, calling for the fellow U.S. allies to overcome grievances rooted in Japan\u2019s brutal colonial rule and develop future-oriented ties. However, he noted that some historical issues remain unresolved and called on the government in Tokyo to \u201csquarely face up to our painful history and strive to maintain trust between our two countries.\u201d",
      "Lee\u2019s meeting with Ishiba will come just before he flies to Washington for a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump over trade and defense issues, a setup that underscores how Trump\u2019s push to reset global trade and U.S. security commitments is drawing the often-feuding neighbors closer.",

      "Lee, who took office after winning an early election in June following the ouster of his conservative predecessor Yoon Suk Yeol over a brief imposition of martial law in December, has taken steps to repair ties with the North, including the removal of South Korean frontline loudspeakers that Yoon\u2019s government had used to blast anti-North Korean propaganda and K-pop across the border.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether North Korea would respond to Lee\u2019s overture. Expressing anger over Yoon\u2019s hardline policies and expansion of South Korean-U.S. military exercises, Kim last year declared that North Korea was abandoning long-standing goals of a peaceful unification with South Korea and rewrote the North\u2019s constitution to mark the South as a permanent enemy.",
      "Lee\u2019s speech came a day after Kim\u2019s powerful sister mocked his government for clinging to hopes of renewed diplomacy between the war-divided rivals, and misleading the public by falsely claiming the North had removed its own frontline speakers as a reciprocal gesture toward the South. South Korea\u2019s military maintains that it confirmed the North dismantling some of its speakers.",
      "Kim Yo Jong also reiterated previous North Korean statements that it has no immediate interest in reviving long-stalled negotiations with Washington and Seoul, citing an upcoming joint military exercise between the allies as proof of their continued hostility toward Pyongyang.",
      "Analysts say North Korea clearly sees no urgency to resume diplomacy with South Korea or the United States, remaining focused on its alignment with Russia. Since Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Pyongyang has made Moscow the priority of its foreign policy, sending thousands of troops and large quantities of military equipment, including artillery and missiles, to help fuel the war.",

      "Paleontologists have identified a new whale species from a 25-million-year-old fossil found on an Australian beach",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Long before whales were majestic, gentle giants, some of their prehistoric ancestors were tiny, weird and feral. A chance discovery of a 25 million-year-old fossil on an Australian beach has allowed paleontologists to identify a rare, entirely new species that could unlock mysteries of whale evolution.",
      "Researchers this week officially named Janjucetus dullardi, a cartoonish creature with bulging eyes the size of tennis balls, in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society. Unlike today's whales, the juvenile specimen was small enough to fit in a single bed.",
      "Boasting fiendish teeth and a shark-like snout, however, this oddball of the ocean was nasty, mean and built to hunt.",
      "\u201cIt was, let\u2019s say, deceptively cute,\u201d said Erich Fitzgerald, senior curator of vertebrate paleontology at Museums Victoria Research Institute, and one of the paper's authors.",
      "\u201cIt might have looked for all the world like some weird kind of mash-up between a whale, a seal and a Pok\u00e9mon but they were very much their own thing.\u201d",
      "The rare discovery of the partial skull, including ear bones and teeth, was made in 2019 on a fossil-rich stretch of coast along Australia\u2019s Victoria state. Jan Juc Beach, a cradle for some of the weirdest whales in history, is becoming a hotspot for understanding early whale evolution, Fitzgerald said.",
      "Few family trees seem stranger than that of Janjucetus dullardi, only the fourth species ever identified from a group known as mammalodontids, early whales that lived only during the Oligocene Epoch, about 34 to 23 million years ago. That marked the point about halfway through the known history of whales.",
      "The tiny predators, thought to have grown to 3 meters (10 feet) in length, were an early branch on the line that led to today\u2019s great baleen whales, such as humpbacks, blues and minkes. But the toothy ancestors with powerful jaws would have looked radically different to any modern species.",
      "\u201cThey may have had tiny little nubbins of legs just projecting as stumps from the wall of the body,\u201d said Fitzgerald.",
      "That mystery will remain tantalizingly unsolved unless a specimen is uncovered with more of its skeleton intact, which would be something of a miracle. Even the partial skull that allowed the initial identification this week was an astonishing discovery.",
      "Janjucetus dullardi was named by researchers after an amateur fossil hunter who doesn\u2019t mind its looks in the slightest.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s literally been the greatest 24 hours of my life,\u201d said Ross Dullard, who discovered the skull while fossil hunting at Jan Juc Beach. After Wednesday\u2019s confirmation of the new species, the school principal walked like a rock star onto campus with \u201chigh fives coming left, right and center,\u201d he said.",
      "His friends and family are probably just relieved it\u2019s over.",

      "\u201cI thought, geez, we\u2019ve got something special here,\u201d he said. Dullard sent photos to Museums Victoria, where Fitzgerald saw them and immediately suspected a new species.",
      "Confirming the find was another matter. This was the first mammalodontid to be identified in Australia since 2006 and only the third on record in the country.",
      "Fossils of sufficient quality, with enough of the right details preserved to confirm uniqueness, aren\u2019t common.",
      "\u201cCetaceans represent a fairly miniscule population of all life,\u201d Fitzgerald said. Millions of years of erosion, scavengers and ocean currents take their toll on whale skeletons too.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s only the chosen few, the vast minority of all whales that have ever lived and died in the oceans over millions of years, that actually get preserved as fossils,\u201d he added.",
      "Finds such as Janjucetus dullardi can unlock insights into how prehistoric whales ate, moved, behaved \u2014 and evolved. Researchers said the discoveries also helped to understand how ancient cetacean species adapted to warmer oceans, as they study how today\u2019s marine life might respond to climate change.",

      "\u201cThat\u2019s taken my concentration for six years,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had sleepless nights. I\u2019ve dreamt about this whale.\u201d",

      "French President Emmanuel Macron says no effort is being spared to track down and prosecute unknown attackers who felled an olive tree planted in memory of Ilan Halimi, a French Jew murdered in 2006",
      "PARIS -- French President Emmanuel Macron pledged Friday that no effort will be spared to track down and prosecute unknown attackers who chopped down an olive tree planted in homage to a French Jew murdered in 2006.",
      "The commemorative tree for Ilan Halimi, planted 14 years ago in the northern Paris suburb of \u00c9pinay-sur-Seine, was felled on Wednesday night, seemingly with a chainsaw. The town posted a photo on its Facebook page showing the tree's leafy, bushy top completely severed from its base, leaving just the stump poking from the ground.",
      "\u201cCutting down the tree that honored Ilan Halimi is an attempt to kill him for a second time,\u201d Macron posted on X. \u201cIt will not succeed: the Nation will not forget this child of France, killed because he was Jewish.\u201d",
      "\u201cAll means are being deployed to punish this act of hatred. In the face of antisemitism, the Republic is always uncompromising.\u201d he added.",
      "Halimi was found naked, handcuffed and covered with burn marks near railroad tracks in the Essonne region south of Paris on Feb. 13, 2006. He died on the way to the hospital after being held captive and tortured for more than three weeks. He was 23. The brutal killing revived worries in France about antisemitism and led to deep anxiety in France\u2019s Jewish community, the largest in western Europe.",

      "Small-scale solar panels about the size of a door are poised to be plugged into more U.S. homes and apartments as homeowners and renters who want to harness the sun\u2019s energy look for cheaper alternatives to rooftop installations",
      "When Terrence Dwyer received a knock on his door and a flyer for a solar panel system small enough to fit on his deck, he was quickly sold. Solar systems that plug into regular wall outlets have been popular in Europe for years and are gaining traction in the U.S. for their affordability and simple installation.",
      "\u201cWe thought absolutely, let\u2019s do this right away,\u201d said Dwyer, who lives in Oakland, California.",
      "These small-scale solar systems could become attractive to more homeowners now that President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping budget-and-policy package will scrap residential rooftop solar tax credits and may shift interest to cheaper alternatives. Even before the GOP bill passed, manufacturers of the smaller systems known as plug-in or balcony solar were seeing increased demand and other positive signs such as a new Utah law streamlining regulations for homeowners to buy and install them. The systems about the size of a door haven\u2019t been as widely adopted in the U.S. as in Europe because of lack of awareness, patchwork utility rules and limited availability.",
      "The $2,000 plug-in solar system installed on Dwyer's backyard deck in March consists of two 400 watt panels, an inverter, a smart meter and a circuit breaker. It saves him around $35 per month on his power bill because he is consuming less energy from the grid, but he said reducing his carbon footprint was his primary motivation.",
      "\u201cWe like the environmental benefits of solar and wanted to engage with solar in some fashion,\u201d Dwyer said.",
      "Had Dwyer opted for rooftop solar, he would have paid $20,000 for the system and $30,000 to upgrade his roof to support the panels.",
      "Installing a plug-in solar system requires some homework. What power companies let customers do with energy-generating equipment varies, which is why prospective purchasers should check their utility\u2019s policies first. Building permits might be required depending on the municipality. Some systems can be self-installed, while others may require an electrician. For example, some kits have meters that must be wired into a home's circuit breaker.",
      "Dwyer bought his system from Bright Saver, a nonprofit company in California that advocates for plug-in solar. In addition to the type Dwyer bought, the company also offers a smaller model costing $399 that recently sold out in six days.",
      "\u201cThe interest and demand have been overwhelming,\u201d said Cora Stryker, a founder of Bright Saver. \u201cIt is clear that we are hitting a nerve \u2014 many Americans have wanted solar for a long time but have not had an option that is feasible and affordable for them until now.\u201d",
      "Kevin Chou, another founder of Bright Saver, said wider adoption of the systems in the U.S. has been hindered by utility policies that create uncertainty about whether they're allowed and a lack of state and local policies to make clear what rules apply.",
      "Some utilities contacted by The Associated Press say plug-in solar systems require the same interconnection applications as rooftop panels that send electricity back to the wider network. But Steven Hegedus, an electrical engineering professor at University of Delaware, said he doesn't understand why a utility would need to require an interconnection agreement for plug-in solar because, unlike rooftop systems, they are designed to prevent energy from flowing to the grid.",
      "Still, if in doubt, a customer should follow their utility's policy.",
      "During the early days of plug-in solar's growth, some opposition from utilities is likely since customers are buying less energy, said Robert Cudd, a research analyst at the California Center for Sustainable Communities at the University of California, Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cUtilities really prefer everyone being a predictable and generous consumer of the electricity they sell,\u201d Cudd said.",
      "This year, Utah enacted a novel law supporting plug-in solar by exempting certain small-scale systems from interconnection agreements and establishing safety requirements such as being certified by a nationally recognized testing organization such as Underwriters Laboratories. It appears to be the only state that's passed legislation supporting plug-in solar, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Republican state Rep. Raymond Ward, who sponsored the legislation, said the smaller systems allow people to better manage where their energy comes from and what they pay.",
      "\u201cEurope has these things. You can go buy them and they work and people want them. There is no reason why we shouldn\u2019t have them here in the United States,\u201d Ward said.",

      "Some questions remain about how much customers could save. Severin Borenstein, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley's Haas School of Business, said the cost of some portable solar systems in the U.S. would make it hard for customers to come out ahead on their utility bills over the time they own them. He estimates the price of a $2,000 system in the U.S. works out to paying about $0.20 a kilowatt-hour over a 25-year period, which only saves people money if they have high utility costs. By comparison, Borenstein said the cost of systems sold in Europe, typically around $600, is equivalent to paying about $0.05 or $0.06 per kilowatt-hour over 25 years.",
      "Baltimore resident Craig Keenan said saving money was only part of why he installed one of the smaller Bright Saver models on his balcony in July.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m interested in renewable energy because the amount of carbon emissions that we produce as a species is very, very unsustainable for our world,\u201d he said.",
      "He said he expects the system will save him about $40 per year on utility bills, so it would take him about 10 years to recoup the cost of the kit.",
      "Keenan, a mechanical engineer, said installation took him 10 to 15 minutes.",
      "\u201cI think anyone can install this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not complicated. It doesn\u2019t require a technical degree.\u201d",
      "Other companies selling plug-in solar kits include Texas-based Craftstrom. It has sold about 2,000 systems in the U.S. since 2021, mostly in California, Texas and Florida. The company's basic kits contain a solar panel that can fit in a backyard or other sunny space, along with equipment to maintain and regulate the flow of energy including an inverter and smart meter.",
      "Kenneth Hutchings, Craftstrom\u2019s chief revenue officer, said their U.S. sales rose this year even before the passage of the GOP tax bill, and he expects demand for plug-in solar to increase further as federal rooftop solar credits expire.",
      "The company advises customers to notify their power company before installation, but it has \"never had any pushback from any utility,\u201d said Michael Scherer, one of the founders of Craftstrom.",
      "China-based EcoFlow plans to begin selling plug-in solar systems in Utah and expand to other states if supportive legislation is passed, said Ryan Oliver, a company spokesperson.",
      "\u201cThis is an example of where technology is sort of ahead of the regulators,\u201d Oliver said, adding: \u201cAs this rolls out to more of a nationwide product, we expect it will become more mainstream as people understand it better.\"",

      "GENEVA -- Negotiations to reach a major treaty to end growing plastic pollution around the world fell apart on Friday, with delegates in Switzerland adjourning with no immediate plans to resume.",
      "The consequence of the failed talks is devastating, as it leaves no clear path for nations to collectively address the mountains of plastic that are filling landfills, clogging oceans and showing up in chunks on beaches and other public places.",
      "\u201cConsensus is dead,\u201d Bjorn Beeler, international coordinator for the International Pollutants Elimination Network, upon adjournment.",
      "Every year, the world makes more than 400 million tons of new plastic, and that could grow by about 70% by 2040 without policy changes. About 100 countries want to limit production. Many have said it\u2019s also essential to address toxic chemicals used to make plastics.",
      "The final decision, or lack there of, underscored the influence of the United States and other oil-producing countries such as Saudi Arabia, which opposed any limit on the productions of plastics, made mostly from fuels like oil and gas.",
      "Nations had worked for 11 days at the United Nations office in Geneva. But they were deadlocked over whether the treaty should reduce exponential growth of plastic production and put global, legally binding controls on toxic chemicals used to make plastics.",
      "Environmentalists, waste pickers and Indigenous leaders and many business executives traveled to the talks to make their voices heard. Indigenous leaders sought a treaty that recognizes their rights and knowledge.",
      "The Youth Plastic Action Network was the only organization that spoke at the closing meeting Friday. Comments from observers were cut off at the request of the U.S. and Kuwait after 24 hours of meetings and negotiating.",
      "After the adjornment, some delegates tried to put a good face on the negotiations and expressed hope for future talks. Delegates did agree they would meet again at some point in the future.",
      "Inger Andersen, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme, said despite challenges, despite the disappointment, \u201cwe have to accept that significant progress was made.\u201d",
      "This process won\u2019t stop, she said, but it\u2019s too soon to say how long it will take to get a treaty now.",
      "The negotiations were supposed to be the last round and produce the first legally binding treaty on plastic pollution, including in the oceans. But just like at the meeting in South Korea last year, the talks ended with no agreement.",
      "Luis Vayas Valdivieso, the chair of the negotiating committee, wrote and presented two drafts of treaty text in Geneva based on the views expressed by the nations. The representatives from 184 countries did not agree to use either one as the basis for their negotiations.",
      "Valdivieso said Friday morning as the delegates reconvened in the assembly hall that no further action was being proposed at this stage on the latest draft.",

The U.S. supported provisions to improve waste collection and management, improve product design and drive recycling, reuse and other efforts to cut the plastic dumped into the environment.",

      "NEW YORK -- Target and Ulta Beauty are parting ways, ending a partnership launched in 2021 that created in-store shops filled with beauty products at hundreds of the discounter's stores.",
      "According to a joint release issued Thursday, the companies said they have \u201cmutually agreed\" not to renew their pact, which concludes in August 2026. Until then, the Ulta Beauty experience at Target will continue in Target stores and on Target.com, the release said.",
      "Ulta is currently in 600 of Target's roughly 1,980 stores, according to a Target spokesperson.",
      "\u201cFor 35 years, Ulta Beauty has revolutionized how people experience beauty \u2014 bringing together an unmatched assortment from mass to luxury \u2014 and our partnership with Target was one of many unique ways we have brought the power of beauty to guests nationwide,\u201d said Amiee Bayer-Thomas, chief retail officer of Ulta Beauty, in a statement.",
      "Rick Gomez, executive vice president and chief commercial officer at Target, said in a statement he was committed to \"offering the beauty experience consumers have come to expect from Target.\u201d",
      "The partnership was announced in 2020 and came as the coronavirus pandemic upended shopping habits and more people tried to minimize potential exposure to the virus through one-stop shopping. COVID had dampened sales of lipstick as people wore masks, but the skincare business enjoyed stronger sales.",
      "The shops are about 1,000 square feet and carry makeup, skincare, and fragrance and operated beside existing beauty sections in Target stores. The deal was a way for both Target and Ulta to increase their customer base.",

      "The Pennsylvania county where an explosion at a U.S. Steel plant south of Pittsburgh killed two people and injured more than 10 others announced Thursday that it is stepping up air quality monitoring in the area of the sprawling facility that has a troubled environmental record.",
      "The Allegheny County Health Department announced that mobile air units provided by the state and Carnegie Mellon University will be stationed in the Mon Valley where the plant is Thursday and Friday. The county said these measures are part of its ongoing investigation into Monday's explosion at Clairton Coke Works.",
      "The county said the measures go \u201cwell beyond the normal and rigorous regulatory air quality monitoring\u201d and will assess parts of the valley for different types of pollutants such as volatile organic compounds, PM2.5 pollutants and sulfur dioxide.",
      "After Monday\u2019s blast, the county health department initially told residents within 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) of the plant to remain indoors and close all windows and doors. The department lifted the advisory after its monitors didn\u2019t detect levels of soot or sulfur dioxide above federal standards.",
      "The Allegheny County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office also confirmed Thursday that the second person who died in the blast was Steven Menefee, 52, of Clairton. Earlier, the county medical examiner\u2019s office identified one of the dead as Timothy Quinn, 39.",
      "U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt said Tuesday the company is working closely with local, state and federal authorities. He would not speculate about the cause of the explosion.",
      "The massive plant along the Monongahela River in Clairton converts coal to coke, a key component in the steelmaking process. The facility is considered the largest coking operation in North America and is one of four major U.S. Steel plants in Pennsylvania.",
      "To make coke, coal is baked in special ovens for hours at high temperatures to remove impurities that could otherwise weaken steel. The process creates what is known as coke gas \u2014 a lethal mix of methane, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.",
      "The plant has a long history of environmental problems, especially fouling the air in communities nearby the sprawling plant.",
      "In 2018, a Christmas Eve fire damaged pollution-control equipment and led to repeated releases of sulfur dioxide, according to a subsequent lawsuit. The fire prompted Allegheny County to warn residents to limit outdoor activities. Residents said it was hard to breathe for weeks afterward and that the air felt acidic and smelled like rotten eggs.

      "Trimoulla said they chose soap because Switzerland is known for its cleanliness, and democracy. She said it's a \u201ccheeky\u201d way to deliver a serious message.",
      "The foundation partnered with Friends of the Earth International and the Break Free From Plastic movement to urge delegates to vote on the treaty. Currently, every nation must agree for any proposal to be included in the treaty. If consensus can\u2019t be reached on the last day, the process could become paralyzed. The talks are scheduled to conclude Thursday.",
      "On Wednesday, Trimoulla had about 10 organic soaps left to hand out out of nearly 400. She said many delegates liked the gift, including those from France, Panama, and \u201ceven the United States.\u201d The foundation wants the treaty to reduce plastic production, whereas the U.S. supports provisions focused on better waste management and reuse to reduce plastic pollution.",

      "\u201cI had been reading a lot of research. So I was already sort of wary that we\u2019re already exposed to so many chemicals,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I was surprised by, is that all over the world, because this study has been carried throughout different regions, we are all being exposed to those added chemicals in plastics. That is concerning.\u201d",
      "The World Wildlife Fund set up a conveyor belt of plastic waste in the plaza in front of the U.N. office Wednesday. A backdrop showed a turtle, dolphin and a person with open mouths, as if the waste was flowing in.",

      "At the mercy of securing a victory to make the 16-driver field that competes for the Cup championship, Austin Dillon wrecked Joey Logano and Denny Hamlin in the final two corners of the last lap to claim his first win in nearly two years.",
      "The celebration was short-lived as NASCAR revoked Dillon\u2019s playoff eligibility three days later in determining the Richard Childress Racing driver \u201ccrossed a line\u201d with rough driving.",
      "\u201cNASCAR drew a line in the sand,\u201d Hamlin said Friday. \u201cThey\u2019re not afraid to make hard decisions, and I think that\u2019s very, very important to the governing of the sport, so it\u2019s not a circus. And so I do feel a little bit better about it now than 12 months ago.",
      "\"Certainly, that was the first time we\u2019d seen something like that, and NASCAR had a precedent to set. If you let that go, you open up a floodgate of crazy things that would be bad for the relevance and legitimacy of the sport. Everyone probably has a little better understanding now because of the ruling.\u201d",
      "As NASCAR\u2019s premier series returns Saturday night to Richmond, Virginia, with two races remaining in the regular season and three open slots in the playoffs, did Dillon\u2019s win establish the new boundary of what\u2019s permissible in pushing for a victory that guarantees a berth in the 10-race run to the title?",
      "For the Cup driver who has gone to greater lengths than anyone in aggressively moving rivals this season, the question is moot.",
      "\u201cI think that was sort of a freak deal,\u201d Spire Motorsports driver Carson Hocevar said. \u201cIf you had them rerun the same play, I don\u2019t think he gets both of them.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever see someone get one guy and then turn down and get the second guy. That was one of those once in a blue moon or lifetime things that was a perfect storm of chaos. They were all in the most perfect spots for him to win by all means necessary. It would be really hard to ever replicate.\u201d",
      "If Richmond were to deliver another combustible finish, few are as willing to tangle with the competition as Hocevar.",
      "The Spire Motorsports driver has gotten sideways with a seemingly endless list of drivers \u2014 Ross Chastain, Ricky Stenhouse Jr. and Zane Smith are among the most aggrieved. Sunday at Watkins Glen International, Hocevar angered Brad Keselowski in qualifying and then collided multiple times with teammate Michael McDowell during the race.",
      "Though he planned to iron out differences with McDowell, the 23-year-old Hocevar seems unconcerned about crossing a veteran with his No. 77 Chevrolet for a win.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t take a head count of who\u2019s frustrated with or mad at us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s constantly changing by the week.\u201d",

The 0.75-mile oval had two annual races on the Cup schedule from 1959-2024 (a 2020 race was canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic). \u2026 Chase Briscoe of Joe Gibbs Racing\u2019s No. 19 Toyota is the only driver with top 10s in the season\u2019s first three short-track races at Martinsville Speedway, Bristol Motor Speedway and Iowa Speedway.",

      "He responded from that early blunder by chipping in for birdie on the sixth hole, the start of eight straight birdies for another record in the four-year history of LIV Golf. He finished with five birdies in a row, hitting a gap wedge to 3 feet on his final hole.",

      "The NCAA has fined Michigan millions and suspended football coach Sherrone Moore for a third game due to a sign-stealing scandal",
      "The NCAA imposed a multimillion-dollar fine on Michigan and suspended football coach Sherrone Moore for a third game on Friday for a sign-stealing scandal that has overshadowed college football's most successful program for nearly two years. Here's what you need to know:",
      "Reports surfaced in 2023 of a scheme run by now-former Michigan staffer Connor Stalions. The scheme involved a network of Stalions' associates \u2014 dubbed the \u201cKGB\u201d \u2014 attending games and recording opposing team sidelines to capture play-calling signals. The NCAA said it found \u201c56 instances of off-campus, in-person scouting of 13 future regular-season opponents\u201d over 52 games over three seasons (2021-23).",
      "The NCAA prohibits in-person scouting of same-season future opponents and using electronic equipment to record another team\u2019s signals.",
      "The NCAA said Stalions spearheaded the sign-stealing operation. The former Marine was accused of assembling a team of scouts which he'd send to games of upcoming opponents. Stalions' network of scouts would provide him with film of signal callers on future opponents' sidelines. The NCAA said he would then decipher the signals, giving Michigan a competitive advantage.",
      "The NCAA said the extent of the operation is not fully known as Stalions and others involved have destroyed and withheld evidence. Stalions, a Navy graduate, was suspended by the school and later resigned. He recently said he knew almost every signal opponents used in seven games over two seasons.",
      "A show-cause order effectively bans an individual from college athletics. In order to be hired for a college sports job by a school that is an NCAA member during a show-cause order, the prospective employer would have to make a strong case, or show cause, in front of the NCAA's Committee on Infractions.",
      "Former coach Jim Harbaugh, former assistant director of player personnel Denard Robinson and Stalions will be prohibited from athletic-related activities for years. Harbaugh was given the longest show-cause order, spanning 10 years after the conclusion of his current four-year order on Aug. 7, 2028. Robinson is banned for three years, and Stalions for eight years. Harbaugh, a former Michigan star quarterback, is heading into his second year as head coach of the NFL's Los Angeles Chargers.",

All top programs are sharing up to $20.5 million this school year directly with their athletes and under the House decision scholarships are unlimited, though there are roster caps. That has forced schools to look for revenue sources from different places. In June, Michigan said revenues and expenses for its next fiscal year were expected to be $266.3 million.",
      "Moore had previously been issued a self-imposed two-game suspension by Michigan, which will be served this season. The NCAA levied an additional one-game suspension, which Moore will serve during next season's opener. Moore received a two-year show-cause order but unlike Stalions and Harbaugh he will be allowed to fulfill coaching commitments and other related activities.",

      "The blockbuster main event features Du Plessis, who defeated Sean Strickland in a split decision at UFC 297, and defended the belt by beating Israel Adesanya at UFC 305 with a fourth-round submission. The South African beat Strickland in a rematch by unanimous decision at UFC 312 to extend his win streak to 11.",
      "Chimaev quickly gained UFC lore when he joined the organization in 2020 and secured three finishes in 66 days. However, Chimaev struggled with illness and became less active. Despite this, he continues to instill fear in his opponents with his violent finishes, including shattering middleweight contender Robert Whittaker\u2019s jaw with a face crank submission in his last fight at UFC 308 in October 2024.",
      "\u201cThis fight is massive and Khamzat is an incredibly good fighter, but what people are going to be saying is the same thing they said after every single one of my fights: He did it again,\" Du Plessis said. \"I will not doubt him again, same old, same old.\u201d",
      "Chimaev has a simple plan for Saturday and is done with all of the pre-fight talk.",
      "\u201cWhatever he says, I don\u2019t care about. All of the fighters talk, but nothing is going to change,\" Chimaev said. \"Everyone has to fight in the cage anyway. Whatever he says, I don\u2019t care about. I come here to beat him up and take my money and go home.\u201d",

      "Chimaev had to pull out of a fight with Leon Edwards in December 2020. It was first rescheduled in 2021 and then rescheduled for March 2021, but Chimaev was not healthy enough to fight. He was unable to make weight for a welterweight fight against Nate Diaz at UFC 279 in September 2022 and was rescheduled to a 180 catchweight fight against Kevin Holland on the same night.",

It never bothered me, but I know it was a question for everyone,\u201d Du Plessis said. \u201cI think it is the hype of this fight. People want to see the two best fighters in the world go at it. And that\u2019s why this fight is so big. A lot of times it\u2019s just not possible to get the two best guys right now because one is injured, and sometimes the two best guys in the world don\u2019t want to fight each other.\u201d",

      "OWINGS MILLS, Md. -- One day it was the putter, another day it was the irons. No one had a lower score than Robert MacIntyre both of those rounds at the BMW Championship, and his reward for his 6-under 64 on Friday was a five-shot lead over Scottie Scheffler going into the weekend.",
      "MacIntyre closed with six straight birdies in the opening round for a 62, and he started the second round with a shot into 5 feet on the 476-yard first hole for another birdie. He kept bogeys off his card this time and set a daunting target at 14-under 126.",
      "Scheffler spent the steamy afternoon trying to keep in range. He had to settle for six pars at the end for a 65 and was at 9-under 131, at least booking a spot in the final group.",
      "Ludvig Aberg shot 64 and was another stroke back.",
      "It was the largest 36-hole lead at the BMW Championship since Jason Day led by five shots in 2015 at Conway Farms. Day went on to win by six.",
      "\u201cIt's only 36 holes gone. There\u2019s a long way to go,\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cI\u2019m comfortable with who I am. I\u2019m comfortable with the team around me, and I\u2019m comfortable on this golf course. Just go and play golf.\u201d",
      "He has made it look as easy as it sounds on a Caves Valley course that has been renovated, lengthened, has new greens and still hasn't put up too much resistance without much wind.",
      "MacIntyre still putted well, except for the 5-foot birdie he missed on the 18th and another birdie chance inside 8 feet on the eighth hole. He has gained 6.8 shots on the field in putting through 36 holes to lead the key putting statistic.",
      "But he was rarely out of position even when he missed a fairway or green.",
      "\u201cYesterday the putter was on fire. Today I felt like my iron play was exceptional,\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cObviously, coming from links golf back out to throwing darts is a bit different technique-wise, turf-wise, so it took a little bit of readjusting, but I\u2019ve got the hang of it.\u201d",
      "Scheffler had his 15th consecutive sub-70 round and pulled within five shots on No. 12 when he hit a 4-iron from 221 yards to 7 feet for birdie. But he had only two reasonable chances from the 15-foot range the rest of the way.",

      "Hideki Matsuyama has yet to make bogey over 36 holes, even more remarkable because he has been feeling ill this week.

      "DENVER -- Arizona, Nevada and Mexico will again live with less water from the Colorado River as drought lingers in the West, federal officials announced Friday.",
      "The Colorado River is a critical lifeline to seven U.S. states, 30 Native American tribes, and two Mexican states. The cuts are based on projections for levels at federal reservoirs \u2014 chief among them Lake Powell and Lake Mead \u2014 released every August by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.",
      "Arizona will again go without 18% of its total Colorado River allocation, while Mexico loses 5%. The reduction for Nevada \u2014 which receives far less water than Arizona, California or Mexico \u2014 will stay at 7%. California won't face any cuts because it has senior water rights and is the last to lose in times of shortage.",
      "Decades of overuse and the effects of long-term drought worsened by climate change means there\u2019s far more demand for water than what actually flows through the river. Low reservoir levels at Lake Mead have triggered mandatory cutbacks every year since 2022, with the deepest cuts in 2023, which hit farmers in Arizona the hardest.",
      "Meanwhile, the states are working to reach agreement by next year on new long-term rules to govern the river in dry years. The Trump administration gave a mid-November deadline for states to reach a preliminary agreement, or risk federal intervention. Negotiations have faced delays as states push back against how much water they should each give up.",
      "The original 1922 Colorado River Compact was calculated based on an amount of water that doesn't exist in today's climate. That leaves the Upper Basin states of New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming and Utah to share far less water after the required amount is sent to the to the \u201cLower Basin\u201d states of Nevada, Arizona and California. Lots of water is also lost to evaporation and leaky infrastructure.",
      "Fairly splitting the river's water in the era of climate change has been vexing for years, with all of the major users hesitant to give anything up as they anticipate a drier future. There has to be enough water in the reservoirs to reach the tunnels that usher water downstream, and ideally, even more water for hydropower generation. Key infrastructure like the Hoover Dam rely on certain water levels in Lake Mead to generate electricity.",
      "Mandatory cuts and emergency water releases are \u201creactive,\" said John Berggren, a regional policy manager at Western Resource Advocates, a nonprofit focused on climate change.",
      "\u201cIf we are going to be able to have a sustainable Colorado River and not just be responding to crisis after crisis, we need large amounts of flexibility built into this new set of guidelines,\" he said.",

      "Some cottontail rabbits in Fort Collins, Colorado, have been drawing attention because they have wart-like growths on their faces that look like horns",
      "DENVER -- A group of rabbits in Colorado with grotesque, hornlike growths may seem straight out of a low-budget horror film, but scientists say there's no reason to be spooked \u2014 the furry creatures merely have a relatively common virus.",
      "The cottontails recently spotted in Fort Collins are infected with the mostly harmless Shope papillomavirus, which causes wart-like growths that protrude from their faces like metastasizing horns.",
      "Viral photos have inspired a fluffle of unflattering nicknames, including \u201cFrankenstein bunnies,\u201d \u201cdemon rabbits\u201d and \u201czombie rabbits.\u201d But their affliction is nothing new, with the virus inspiring ancient folklore and fueling scientific research nearly 100 years ago.",
      "The virus likely influenced the centuries-old jackalope myth in North America, which told of a rabbit with antlers or horns, among other animal variations. The disease in rabbits also contributed to scientists' knowledge about the connection between viruses and cancer, such as the human papillomavirus that causes cervical cancer.",
      "The virus in rabbits was named after Dr. Richard E Shope, a professor at The Rockefeller University who discovered the disease in cottontails in the 1930s.",
      "News about the rabbit sightings in Fort Collins, 65 miles (105 kilometers) north of Denver, started getting attention after residents started spotting them around town and posting pictures.",
      "Kara Van Hoose, a spokesperson for Colorado Parks and Wildlife, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the agency has been getting calls about the rabbits seen in Fort Collins.",

      "\"People over-assign impact to actually pretty low-impact actions such as recycling, and underestimate the actual carbon impact of behaviors much more carbon intensive, like flying or eating meat,\" said Madalina Vlasceanu, report co-author and professor of environmental social sciences at Stanford University.",
      "The top three individual actions that help the climate, including avoiding plane flights, choosing not to get a dog and using renewable electricity, were also the three that participants underestimated the most. Meanwhile, the lowest-impact actions were changing to more efficient appliances and swapping out light bulbs, recycling, and using less energy on washing clothes. Those were three of the top four overestimated actions in the report.",
      "Vlasceanu said marketing focuses more on recycling and using energy-efficient light bulbs than on why flights or dog adoption are relatively bad for the climate, so participants were more likely to give those actions more weight.",

      "\u201cYou can see the bottle being recycled. That\u2019s visible. Whereas carbon emissions, that\u2019s invisible to the human eye. So that\u2019s why we don\u2019t associate emissions with flying,\u201d said Jiaying Zhao, who teaches psychology and sustainability at the University of British Columbia.",
      "Zhao added it's easier to bring actions to mind that we do more often. \u201cRecycling is an almost daily action, whereas flying is less frequent. It\u2019s less discussed,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a result, people give a higher psychological weight to recycling.\u201d",
      "Of course, there is also a lot of misleading information. For example, some companies tout the recycling they do while not telling the public about pollution that comes from their overall operations.",

      "Dogs are big meat eaters, and meat is a significant contributor to climate change. That is because many of the farm animals, which will become food, release methane, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. Beef is especially impactful, in part because around the world cattle are often raised on land that was illegally deforested. Since trees absorb carbon dioxide, the most abundant greenhouse gas, cutting them to then raise cattle is a double whammy.",
      "\u201cPeople just don\u2019t associate pets with carbon emissions. That link is not clear in people\u2019s minds,\u201d Zhao said.",

Some of the biggest climate decisions individuals can make include how they heat and cool their homes and the types of transportation they use. Switching to renewable energy minimizes the impact of both.",

Plus, less than 10% of plastics actually get recycled, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "Other decisions with overestimated impact, including washing clothes in cold water and switching to more efficient light bulbs, are relatively less important.

      "The threatened species, which makes its habitat in warmer southern Gulf waters in places like Florida, was first seen July 26 off the southwestern coast of Cape Cod in the area of Nantucket Sound. Mashpee resident Jennifer Sullivan took a video of it swimming alongside paddle boarders in an inlet behind a marina surrounded by sea grass.",

      "A few days later, the animal was seen stranded on the tidal flats in Mattapoisett. Bystanders who found the manatee beached on the flats around sunrise pushed it back into the water, said Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries Protected Species Program Manager Erin Burke.",
      "It hasn't been spotted since, Burke said, but a team with the International Fund for Animal Welfare is standing by to rescue the animal if it becomes necessary.",
      "The species prefers swimming in warmer waters, usually traveling only as far north as the Carolinas. If the manatee stays in water that is too cold for too long, it could suffer severe illness or death, said New England Aquarium Research Scientist Dr. Nadine Lysiak.",
      "Additionally, manatees are herbivores that sustain themselves on extensive seagrass beds and mangroves not typically found in New England.",

      "Lysiak said it's unclear how and why the manatee found its way so far north. It may have followed the warm water Gulf Stream current system from Florida up past the Carolinas and eventually found its way to New England, she said.",
      "\u201cWe have kind of an average understanding of what a wild population does in terms of their range, or their habitat range, and some individuals will go beyond that and maybe wander or seek out other habitats or other food sources,\" she said. \"It\u2019s hard to know exactly why this manatee came to Cape Cod.\u201d",

      "More than 70 million Americans have experienced the muggiest start to summer on record, with climate change increasing humidity in the Eastern U.S. An Associated Press analysis shows that parts of 20 states and Washington, D",
      "More than 70 million Americans sweated through the muggiest first two months of summer on record as climate change has noticeably dialed up the Eastern United States' humidity in recent decades, an Associated Press data analysis shows.",
      "And that meant uncomfortably warm and potentially dangerous nights in many cities the last several weeks, the National Weather Service said.",
      "Parts of 27 states and Washington, D.C., had a record amount of days that meteorologists call uncomfortable \u2014 with average daily dew points of 65 degrees Fahrenheit or higher \u2014 in June and July, according to data derived from the Copernicus Climate Service.",
      "And that's just the daily average. In much of the East, the mugginess kept rising to near tropical levels for a few humid hours. Philadelphia had 29 days, Washington had 27 days and Baltimore had 24 days where the highest dew point simmered to at least 75 degrees, which even the the weather service office in Tampa calls oppressive, according to weather service data.",
      "Dew point is a measure of moisture in the air expressed in degrees that many meteorologists call the most accurate way to describe humidity. The summer of 2025 so far has had dew points that average at least 6 degrees higher than the 1951-2020 normals in Washington, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Richmond, Columbus and St. Louis, the AP calculations show. The average June and July humidity for the entire country east of the Rockies rose to more than 66 degrees, higher than any year since measurements started in 1950.",
      "\u201cThis has been a very muggy summer. The humid heat has been way up,\u201d said Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at Climate Central.",
      "Twice this summer climate scientist and humidity expert Cameron Lee of Kent State University measured dew points of about 82 degrees at his home weather station in Ohio. That's off the various charts that the weather service uses to describe what dew points feel like.",
      "\u201cThere are parts of the United States that are experiencing not only greater average humidity, especially in the spring and summer, but also more extreme humid days,\u201d Lee said. He said super sticky days are now stretching out over more days and more land.",
      "High humidity doesn't allow the air to cool at night as much as it usually does, and the stickiness contributed to multiple nighttime temperature records from the Ohio Valley through the Mid-Atlantic and up and down coastal states, said Zack Taylor, forecast operations chief at the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center. Raleigh, Charlotte, Nashville, Virginia Beach, Va., and Wilmington, N.C., all reached records for the hottest overnight lows. New York City, Columbus, Atlanta, Richmond, Knoxville, Tennessee and Concord, New Hampshire came close, he said.",
      "\u201cWhat really impacts the body is that nighttime temperature,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cSo if there\u2019s no cooling at night or if there\u2019s a lack of cooling it doesn\u2019t allow your body to cool off and recover from what was probably a really hot afternoon. And so when you start seeing that over several days, that can really wear out the body, especially of course if you don\u2019t have access to cooling centers or air conditioning.\u201d",
      "An extra hot and rainy summer weather pattern is combining with climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, Woods Placky said.",
      "The area east of the Rockies has on average gained about 2.5 degrees in summer dew point since 1950, the AP analysis of Copernicus data shows. In the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and part of the 1990s, the eastern half of the country had an average dew point in the low 60s, what the weather service calls noticeable but OK. In four of the last six years that number has been near and even over the uncomfortable line of 65.",

      "TAITA TAVETA, Kenya -- For farmers in the Taita hills in southern Kenya, elephants are a menace: they raid crops and will occasionally injure or even kill people.",
      "Farmer Richard Shika, 68, has had some close encounters. \u201cOne time, I was trying to chase away an elephant that was in my maize field, but it turned and charged me,\u201d Shika remembers. \u201cIt stopped when it was right in front of me, and I managed to jump out of the way.\u201d",
      "He feels lucky to be alive. Almost exactly two years ago, local media reported that a 3-year-old girl had been trampled to death by an elephant in Taita Taveta county, her mother injured.",
      "The area where Shika has his farm is almost surrounded by Kenya\u2019s biggest National Park. The border of Tsavo East National Park is less than 10 kilometers (6 miles) to the east, and Tsavo West curves around to the north, west and south. The parks have always been unfenced, allowing animals to migrate. Increasingly, that puts them in the path of humans.",
      "\u201cThe places and infrastructure that we humans develop hinder the migratory routes and paths which elephants used to take,\u201d explains Yuka Luvonga, who researches human-elephant coexistence for conservation organization Save The Elephants.",
      "Elephants eat about 150 kilograms (330 pounds) of vegetation a day, so keeping them off farms is tricky, especially if forage is scarce elsewhere. \u201cElephants are clever creatures,\u201d says Shika. \u201cThey will try touching a fence, and once they realize that it is not electrified, they charge through.\u201d",
      "If farmers try to chase them off, as Shika did, the elephants will sometimes turn and defend themselves. Kenya Wildlife Service and conservation organizations tracking human-elephant conflict estimate that 30-35 people are killed every year in elephant-related incidents across Kenya.",
      "Communities will sometimes retaliate by spearing or poisoning elephants, but there are other solutions, as farmers here have found.",
      "One of them is bees.",
      "\u201cElephants don\u2019t like getting stung by bees, so they keep away from areas where hives are,\u201d Shika says.",
      "With help from Save The Elephants, Shika is one of 50 farmers who have hung beehives from wires between poles around their farms. If an elephant touches the wire, the hives are rocked, disturbing the bees. It\u2019s an army of tiny security guards that keeps elephants well away from the farm.",
      "\u201cWith hives acting as a fence, I can continue crop-farming and also earn a livelihood from honey,\u201d Shika says. This year, he\u2019s made almost $250 selling honey.",

    "story": [
      "Delivery drones are supposed to be fast, yet the long-promised technology has been slow to take off in the United States",
      "Delivery drones are so fast they can zip a pint of ice cream to a customer\u2019s driveway before it melts.",
      "Yet the long-promised technology has been slow to take off in the United States. More than six years after the Federal Aviation Administration approved commercial home deliveries with drones, the service mostly has been confined to a few suburbs and rural areas.",
      "That could soon change. The FAA proposed a new rule last week that would make it easier for companies to fly drones outside of an operator's line of sight and therefore over longer distances. A handful of companies do that now, but they had to obtain waivers and certification as an air carrier to deliver packages.",
      "While the rule is intended to streamline the process, authorized retailers and drone companies that have tested fulfilling orders from the sky say they plan to make drone-based deliveries available to millions more U.S. households.",
      "Walmart and Wing, a drone company owned by Google parent Alphabet, currently provide deliveries from 18 Walmart stores in the Dallas area. By next summer, they expect to expand to 100 Walmart stores in Atlanta; Charlotte, North Carolina; Houston; and Orlando and Tampa, Florida.",
      "After launching its Prime Air delivery service in College Station, Texas, in late 2022, Amazon received FAA permission last year to operate autonomous drones that fly beyond a pilot's line of sight. The e-commerce company has since expand its drone delivery program to suburban Phoenix and has plans to offer the service in Dallas, San Antonio, Texas, and Kansas City.",
      "The concept of drone delivery has been around for well over a decade. Drone maker Zipline, which works with Walmart in Arkansas and the Dallas-Fort Worth area, began making deliveries to hospitals in Rwanda in 2016. Israel-based Flytrex, one of the drone companies DoorDash works with to carry out orders, launched drone delivery to households in Iceland in 2017.",
      "But Wing CEO Adam Woodworth said drone delivery has been in \u201ctreading water mode\u201d in the U.S. for years, with service providers afraid to scale up because the regulatory framework wasn\u2019t in place.",
      "\u201cYou want to be at the right moment where there\u2019s an overlap between the customer demand, the partner demand, the technical readiness and the regulatory readiness,\u201d Woodworth said. \u201cI think that we\u2019re reaching that planetary alignment right now.\u201d",
      "DoorDash, which works with both Wing and Flytrex, tested drone drop-offs in rural Virginia and greater Dallas before announcing an expansion into Charlotte. Getting takeout food this way may sound futuristic, but it's starting to feel normal in suburban Brisbane, Australia, where DoorDash has employed delivery drones for several years, said Harrison Shih, who leads the company's drone program.",
      "\u201cIt comes so fast and it's something flying into your neighborhood, but it really does seem like part of everyday life,\u201d Shih said.",
      "Even though delivery drones are still considered novel, the cargo they carry can be pretty mundane. Walmart said the top items from the more than 150,000 drone deliveries the nation's largest retailer has completed since 2021 include ice cream, eggs and Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups.",
      "Unlike traditional delivery, where one driver may have a truck full of packages, drones generally deliver one small order at a time. Wing\u2019s drones can carry packages weighing up to 2.5 pounds. They can travel up to 12 miles round trip. One pilot can oversee up to 32 drones.",
      "Zipline has a drone that can carry up to 4 pounds and fly 120 miles round trip. Some drones, like Amazon\u2019s, can carry heavier packages.",
      "Once an order is placed, it's packaged for flight and attached to a drone at a launch site. The drone automatically finds a route that avoids obstacles. A pilot observes as the aircraft flies to its destinations and lowers its cargo to the ground with retractable cords.",
      "Shakiba Enayati, an assistant professor of supply chain and analytics at the University of Missouri, St. Louis, researches ways that drones could speed the delivery of critical health supplies like donated organs and blood samples. The unmanned aircraft offer some advantages as a transport method, such as reduced emissions and improved access to goods for rural residents, Enayati said.",
      "But she also sees plenty of obstacles. Right now, it costs around $13.50 per delivery to carry a package by drone versus $2 for a traditional vehicle, Enayati said. Drones need well-trained employees to oversee them and can have a hard time in certain weather.",

She thinks the same thing could happen with drones, especially as improved technology reduces the chance for errors.",
      "Woodworth added that U.S. airspace is tightly controlled, and companies need to demonstrate to the FAA that their drones are safe and reliable before they are cleared to fly. Even under the proposed new rules, the FAA would set detailed requirements for drone operators.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why it takes so long to build a business in the space. But I think it leads to everybody fundamentally building higher quality things,\u201d Woodworth said.",
      "Others worry that drones may potentially replace human delivery drivers. Shih thinks that\u2019s unlikely. One of DoorDash's most popular items is 24-packs of water, Shih said, which aren't realistic for existing drones to ferry.",
      "\u201cI believe that drone delivery can be fairly ubiquitous and can cover a lot of things. We just don't think its probable today that it\u2019ll carry a 40-pound bag of dog food to you,\" Shih said.",
      "DoorDash said that in the areas where it offers drone deliveries, orders requiring the services of human delivery drivers also increase.",
      "That\u2019s been the experience of John Kim, the owner of PurePoke restaurant in Frisco, Texas. Kim signed on to offer drone deliveries through DoorDash last year. He doesn\u2019t know what percentage of his DoorDash customers are choosing the service instead of regular delivery, but his overall DoorDash orders are up 15% this year.",
      "Kim said he\u2019s heard no complaints from drone delivery customers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very stable, maybe even better than some of the drivers that toss it in the back with all the other orders,\u201d Kim said.",
      "For some, drones can simply be a nuisance. When the FAA asked for public comments on Amazon\u2019s request to expand deliveries in College Station, numerous residents expressed concern that drones with cameras violated their privacy. Amazon says its drones use cameras and sensors to navigate and avoid obstacles but may record overhead videos of people while completing a delivery.",
      "Other residents complained about noise.",
      "\u201cIt sounds like a giant nagging mosquito,\u201d one respondent wrote. Amazon has since released a quieter drone.",
      "But others love the service. Janet Toth of Frisco, Texas, said she saw drone deliveries in Korea years ago and wondered why the U.S. didn\u2019t have them. So she was thrilled when DoorDash began providing drone delivery in her neighborhood.",
      "Toth now orders drone delivery a few times a month. Her 9-year-old daughter Julep said friends often come over to watch the drone.",
      "\u201cI love to go outside, wave at the drone, say \u2018Thank you\u2019 and get the food,\u201d Julep Toth said.",

      "YouTube on Wednesday will begin testing a new age-verification system in the U.S. that relies on artificial intelligence to differentiate between adults and minors, based on the kinds of videos that they have been watching.",
      "The tests initially will only affect a sliver of YouTube's audience in the U.S., but it will likely become more pervasive if the system works as well at guessing viewers' ages as it does in other parts of the world. The system will only work when viewers are logged into their accounts, and it will make its age assessments regardless of the birth date a user might have entered upon signing up.",
      "If the system flags a logged-in viewer as being under 18, YouTube will impose the normal controls and restrictions that the site already uses as a way to prevent minors from watching videos and engaging in other behavior deemed inappropriate for that age.",

He said increasing the area's year-round appeal is \u201cthe future of tourism,\u201d but acknowledged it\u2019s a long-term strategy.",

Despite having so much at stake, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders aren't invited.",

By bringing Putin onto U.S. soil \u2014 America bought Alaska from Russia in 1867 for 2 cents per acre \u2014 the president is giving him the validation he desires after his ostracization following his invasion of Ukraine 3 1/2 years ago. Zelenskyy's exclusion from Trump and Putin's first meeting is a heavy blow to the West\u2019s policy of \u201cnothing about Ukraine without Ukraine\u201d and invites the possibility that Trump could agree to a deal that Ukraine does not want.",
      "Any success is far from assured because Russia and Ukraine remain far apart in their demands for peace. Putin has long resisted any temporary ceasefire, linking it to a halt in Western arms supplies and a freeze on Ukraine\u2019s mobilization efforts, which were conditions rejected by Kyiv and its Western allies.",

Putin was reviewing materials on Ukraine, tensions with the U.S., economic cooperation and global affairs during his four-hour flight to Alaska, where he will be greeted at his plane by Trump, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in an interview with Russian state TV.",
      "Trump and Putin have shared closely watched handshakes before \u2014 but Friday's will be as scrutinized as any, as will any body language or hints about how each is feeling.",
      "Trump on Thursday said there was a 25% chance that the summit would fail, but he also floated the idea that if the meeting succeeds he could bring Zelenskyy to Alaska for a subsequent, three-way meeting \u2014 a possibility that Russia hasn't agreed to.",
      "When asked after arriving in Alaska about Trump's estimate of a 25% chance of failure, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters that Russia \u201cnever plans ahead.\u201d",

      "Trump said in a Fox News radio interview Thursday that he didn't know if they would get \u201can immediate ceasefire\u201d but he wanted a broad peace deal done quickly. That seemingly echoes Putin\u2019s longtime argument that Russia favors a comprehensive deal to end the fighting, reflecting its demands, not a temporary halt to hostilities.",
      "The Kremlin said Trump and Putin will first sit down for a one-on-one discussion, followed by the two delegations meeting and talks continuing over \u201ca working breakfast.\u201d They are then expected to hold a joint press conference.",
      "In the days leading up to the summit, Trump described it as \u201c really a feel-out meeting.\u201d But he's also warned of \u201cvery severe consequences\u201d for Russia if Putin doesn't agree to end the war and said that though Putin might bully other leaders, \u201cHe\u2019s not going to mess around with me.\u201d",
      "Trump said Friday that his talks with Putin will include Russian demands that Ukraine cede territory as part of a peace deal. He said Ukraine has to decide, but he also suggested Zelenskyy should accept concessions.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve got to let Ukraine make that decision. And I think they\u2019ll make a proper decision,\u201d Trump told reporters traveling with him to Alaska.",

There, the pair were joined by two of their top aides: Secretary of State and national security adviser Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff for Trump and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and national security adviser Yuri Ushakov for Putin.",
      "Putin, who spoke first after the meeting concluded, lauded the historical relationship between the United States, Russia and the former Soviet Union, recalling joint missions conducted by the two countries during World War II.",
      "He said the U.S. and Russia share values, a standard talking point for Russian officials when trying to woo Trump and his aides. Putin also noted that Trump has frequently said the Ukraine war wouldn\u2019t have happened had he won the 2020 election.",

      "A federal grand jury has indicted New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell after a long corruption investigation",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell was indicted Friday in what prosecutors called a yearslong scheme to hide a romantic relationship with her bodyguard, who is accused of being paid as if he was working even when they met alone in apartments and traveled to vineyards for wine tasting.",
      "Cantrell faces charges of conspiracy, fraud and obstruction, less than five months before she leaves office due to term limits. The first female mayor in New Orleans' 300-year history was elected twice but now becomes the city's first mayor to be charged while in office.",
      "\u201cPublic corruption has crippled us for years and years,\u201d Acting U.S. Attorney Michael Simpson said, referring to Louisiana's notorious history. \u201cAnd this is extremely significant.\u201d",
      "Cantrell's bodyguard, Jeffrey Vappie, was already facing charges of wire fraud and making false statements. He has pleaded not guilty. A grand jury returned an 18-count indictment Friday that added Cantrell to the case.",
      "They\u2019re accused of exchanging encrypted messages through WhatsApp to avoid detection and then deleting the conversations. The mayor and Vappie have said their relationship was strictly professional, but the indictment portrayed it as \u201cpersonal and intimate.\u201d",
      "The mayor\u2019s office didn\u2019t immediately respond to a phone message or email from The Associated Press seeking comment on the charges Cantrell hasn\u2019t sent out a message on her official social media feed on X since July 15, when she said the city was experiencing historic declines in crime.",
      "In a WhatsApp exchange, the indictment says, Vappie reminisced about accompanying Cantrell to Scotland in October 2021, saying that was \u201cwhere it all started.\u201d",
      "Cantrell and Vappie used WhatsApp for more than 15,000 messages, including efforts to harass a citizen, delete evidence, make false statements to FBI agents, \u201cand ultimately to commit perjury before a federal grand jury,\u201d Simpson said.",
      "They met in an apartment while Vappie claimed to be on duty, and she arranged for him to attend 14 trips, Simpson said. The trips, he added, were described by her as times \u201cwhen they were truly alone.\"",
      "New Orleans taxpayers paid more than $70,000 for Vappie\u2019s travel, the prosecutor said.",
      "Authorities cited a September 2022 rendezvous on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, a trip Cantrell took instead of attending a conference in Miami. Vappie\u2019s travel to the island was covered by the city to attend a separate conference. \u201cThe times when we are truly (traveling) is what spoils me the most,\u201d the mayor wrote to him that month.",
      "Simpson said Cantrell lied in an affidavit that she activated a function on her phone that automatically deleted messages in 2021 when she really didn\u2019t active that feature until December 2022, a month after the media began speculating on the pair\u2019s conduct.",

      "The U.S. plans to build a $750 million factory in southern Texas to breed billions of sterile flies to ramp up its efforts to keep flesh-eating maggots now in Mexico from damaging the American cattle industry",
      "The U.S. plans to build a $750 million factory in southern Texas to breed billions of sterile flies, ramping up its efforts to keep flesh-eating maggots in Mexico from crossing the border and damaging the American cattle industry.",
      "Secretary Brooke Rollins announced Friday that the U.S. Department of Agriculture hopes to be producing and releasing sterile male New World screwworm flies into the wild within a year from the new factory on Moore Air Base outside Edinburg, Texas, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the border. She also said the USDA plans to deploy $100 million in technology, such as fly traps and lures, and step up border patrols by \u201ctick riders\u201d mounted on horseback and train dogs to sniff out the parasite.",
      "In addition, Rollins said the U.S. border will remain closed to cattle, horse and bison imports from Mexico until the U.S. sees that the pest is being pushed back south toward Panama, where the fly had been contained through late last year through the breeding of sterile flies there. The U.S. has closed its border to those imports three times in the past eight months, the last in July, following a report of an infestation about 370 miles (595 kilometers) from the Texas border.",
      "American officials worry that if the fly reaches Texas, its flesh-eating maggots could cause billions of dollars in economic losses and cause already record retail beef prices to rise even more, fueling greater inflation. The parasite also can infest wildlife, household pets and, occasionally, humans.",
      "\u201cFarm security is national security,\u201d Rollins said during a news conference at the Texas State Capitol in Austin with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. \u201cAll Americans should be concerned. But it\u2019s certainly Texas and our border and livestock producing states that are on the front lines of this every day.\u201d",
      "The pest was a problem for the American cattle industry for decades until the U.S. largely eradicated it in the 1970s by breeding and releasing sterile male flies to breed with wild females. It shut down fly factories on U.S. soil afterward.",
      "The Mexican cattle industry has been hit hard by infestations and the U.S. closing its border to imports.",
      "Mexico\u2019s Agriculture ministry said in a statement Friday that Mexico Agriculture and Rural Development Secretary Julio Berdegu\u00e9 Sacrist\u00e1n and Rollins signed a screwworm control action plan. It includes monitoring with fly-attracting traps and establishing that livestock can only be moved within Mexico through government-certified corrals, the statement said.",
      "And on the X social media platform, Berdegu\u00e9 said, \u201cWe will continue with conversations that lead to actions that will permit the reopening of livestock exports.\"",

      "The new fly-breeding factory in Texas would be the first on U.S. soil in decades and represents a ramping up of the USDA's spending on breeding and releasing sterile New World screwworm flies. The sterile males are released in large enough numbers that wild females can't help but mate with them, producing sterile eggs that don't hatch. Eventually, the wild fly population shrinks away because females mate only once in their weekslong lives.",
      "In June, Rollins announced a plan to convert an existing factory for breeding fruit flies into one for breeding sterile New World Screwworm flies, as well as a plan to build a site, also on the air base near Edinburg, for gathering flies imported from Panama and releasing them from small aircraft. Those projects are expected to cost a total of $29.5 million.",
      "The Panama fly factory can breed up to 117 million flies a week, and the new Mexican fly factory is expected to produce up to 100 million more a week. Rollins said the new Texas factory would produce up to 300 million a week. She said President Donald Trump's administration wants to end the U.S. reliance on fly breeding in Mexico and Panama.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a tactical move that ensures we are prepared and not just reactive, which is today what we have really been working through,\u201d Rollins said.",

Elections committees in both houses are asking for public feedback on the proposed map, but it's unlikely any changes would be made after the bills are officially introduced Monday.",

      "A U.S. district judge on Friday denied the latest request by a Native American tribe, environmentalists and other plaintiffs to stop the federal government from transferring land in Arizona for a massive copper mining project.",
      "The ruling by Judge Dominic Lanza triggered an immediate appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals as a deadline fast approaches for the federal government to move ahead with the transfer next week.",
      "Lanza outlined the \u201cstark trade-offs\u201d at the heart of the fight over Oak Flat, an area considered sacred. He pointed to the economic and national security benefits that would come from the land transfer and the indescribable hardships that would result from the permanent destruction of the Apaches' historical place of worship.",
      "Lanza wrote that the nation's political branches are responsible for weighing competing objectives and determining how to balance them.",
      "\u201cHere, Congress chose to pursue the land exchange despite the existence of many significant trade-offs and the president chose to ratify Congress\u2019s choice by signing the law into effect,\u201d he wrote. \"As a result, the Court must accept that this choice advances the public interest and operate from that premise.\u201d",
      "Conservation groups that are appealing the decision acknowledged that the clock was ticking but said they were not giving up.",
      "The San Carlos Apache Tribe, the group Apache Stronghold and other plaintiffs having been fighting in court for years to save what tribal members call Chi\u2019chil Bildagoteel, which is dotted with ancient oak groves and traditional plants the Apaches consider essential to their religion.",

      "The plaintiffs also raised concerns that an appraisal failed to account for the value of the copper deposits underlying one of the federal parcels to be exchanged",

In May, CBP held 46 children for over a week, including six children held for over two weeks and four children held 19 days, according to data revealed in a court filing. In March and April, CPB reported that it had 213 children in custody for more than 72 hours. That included 14 children, including toddlers, who were held for over 20 days in April.",

Currently, the agreement allows for third-party inspections at facilities in the El Paso and Rio Grande Valley regions, but plaintiffs submitted evidence showing long detention times at border facilities that violate the agreement's terms.",

      "As of Friday, none of the bats found in some of the eight linked cabins at Jackson Lake Lodge had tested positive for rabies.",

      "Other bats weren't killed but got shooed out through cabin doors and windows. Meanwhile, the vast majority never flapped down from the attic into living spaces.",
      "Health officials thus deemed it better safe than sorry to alert everybody who has stayed in the cabins recently that they might have been exposed by being bitten or scratched. Especially when people are sleeping, a bat bite or scratch can go unseen and unnoticed.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re really concerned about is people who saw bats in their rooms and people who might have had direct contact with a bat,\u201d Harrist said Friday.",

      "Bats are a frequent vector of the rabies virus. Once symptoms occur \u2014 muscle aches, vomiting, itching, to name a few \u2014 rabies is almost always fatal in humans.",
      "The good news is a five-shot prophylactic regimen over a two-week period soon after exposure is highly effective in preventing illness, Harrist noted.",
      "The cabins opened for the summer season in May after being vacant over the winter. Based on the roughly 250 reservations through late July, health officials estimated that up to 500 people had stayed in the cabins.",

The latest report from CBO showed how Trump's signature tax and spending law could put new pressure on federal programs that are bedrocks of the American social safety net.",
      "Trump and Republicans pledged not to cut Medicare as part of the legislation, but the estimated $3.4 trillion that the law adds to the federal deficit over the next decade means that many Medicare programs could still see cuts. In the past, Congress has always acted to mitigate cuts to Medicare and other programs, but it would take some bipartisan cooperation to do so.",

Before coming to Washington, Kennedy had spent much of his career decrying the harms of chemicals sprayed on crops, prescription drugs, ultraprocessed foods, and vaccines.",

But a draft of the so-called \u201cMAHA\u201d report, first reported by The New York Times Thursday night, mostly calls on the government to further study chronic diseases, bad air quality, Americans\u2019 diets and prescription drug use.",
      "The report lays out four problem areas \u2013 poor diet, chemical exposure, lack of physical activity and overuse of medications -- that are to blame for chronic diseases in the U.S.",
      "The White House has held off on publicly releasing the report, which was submitted to President Donald Trump on Tuesday. The latest report is the policy companion to a \u201cMAHA\u201d report released in May, which was found to have several errors in it.",

      "\u201cPresident Trump pledged to Make America Healthy Again, and the Administration is committed to delivering on that pledge with Gold Standard Science,\u201d Desai said. \u201cUntil officially released by the White House and MAHA Commission, however, any documents purporting to be the second MAHA Report should be considered as nothing more than speculative literature.\u201d",
      "Some in the agricultural industry had warily anticipated the report, fearing it would call for bans or investigations into the use of pesticides and herbicides that farmers in the U.S. regularly spray on crops to control weeds and enhance yields. Other farmers were concerned about how the report may target the use of corn syrup, a common sweetener, in American foods. Both products have been a central talking point in Kennedy\u2019s \u201cMAHA\u201d movement, which has attracted a diverse coalition of suburban and rural moms, Trump supporters and liberals concerned about the nation\u2019s food supply.",
      "Instead, the report calls for an \u201cawareness\u201d campaign to raise confidence in pesticides.",

      "About 60 shops were licensed and opened under the incorrect measurement system, state officials said, plus around another 40 that have licenses but haven't yet opened for business. Then there are almost 50 other businesses that have applied for licenses and are awaiting final approval from the state.",

      "Federal officials say Arizona, Nevada and Mexico must again live with less Colorado River water as drought lingers in the West",
      "DENVER -- Arizona, Nevada and Mexico will again live with less water from the Colorado River as drought lingers in the West, federal officials announced Friday.",
      "The Colorado River is a critical lifeline to seven U.S. states, 30 Native American tribes, and two Mexican states. The cuts are based on projections for levels at federal reservoirs \u2014 chief among them Lake Powell and Lake Mead \u2014 released every August by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.",
      "Arizona will again go without 18% of its total Colorado River allocation, while Mexico loses 5%. The reduction for Nevada \u2014 which receives far less water than Arizona, California or Mexico \u2014 will stay at 7%. California won't face any cuts because it has senior water rights and is the last to lose in times of shortage.",
      "Decades of overuse and the effects of long-term drought worsened by climate change means there\u2019s far more demand for water than what actually flows through the river. Low reservoir levels at Lake Mead have triggered mandatory cutbacks every year since 2022, with the deepest cuts in 2023, which hit farmers in Arizona the hardest.",
      "Meanwhile, the states are working to reach agreement by next year on new long-term rules to govern the river in dry years. The Trump administration gave a mid-November deadline for states to reach a preliminary agreement, or risk federal intervention. Negotiations have faced delays as states push back against how much water they should each give up.",
      "The original 1922 Colorado River Compact was calculated based on an amount of water that doesn't exist in today's climate. That leaves the Upper Basin states of New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming and Utah to share far less water after the required amount is sent to the to the \u201cLower Basin\u201d states of Nevada, Arizona and California. Lots of water is also lost to evaporation and leaky infrastructure.",
      "Fairly splitting the river's water in the era of climate change has been vexing for years, with all of the major users hesitant to give anything up as they anticipate a drier future. There has to be enough water in the reservoirs to reach the tunnels that usher water downstream, and ideally, even more water for hydropower generation. Key infrastructure like the Hoover Dam rely on certain water levels in Lake Mead to generate electricity.",
      "Mandatory cuts and emergency water releases are \u201creactive,\" said John Berggren, a regional policy manager at Western Resource Advocates, a nonprofit focused on climate change.",
      "\u201cIf we are going to be able to have a sustainable Colorado River and not just be responding to crisis after crisis, we need large amounts of flexibility built into this new set of guidelines,\" he said.",
      "\u201cWe can and must do better. Nature isn\u2019t waiting for us,\u201d said Becky Mitchell, Colorado\u2019s commissioner in the Upper Colorado River Commission.",
      "States are considering a so-called natural flow approach to managing the river \u2014 where the Lower Basin would receive a certain percentage of the average natural flow from the prior few years.",

      "NEW YORK -- A Brooklyn construction magnate was sentenced Friday to a year of probation for working with a Turkish government official to funnel illegal campaign contributions to New York City Mayor Eric Adams, resolving one of two related federal cases after the mayor\u2019s criminal charges were dropped.",
      "Erden Arkan, 76, told Manhattan federal Judge Dale Ho that he regretted his \u201cpoor judgments\u201d in engaging in the straw donor scheme, which helped Adams fraudulently obtain public money for his 2021 mayoral bid under the city\u2019s matching funds program.",
      "Ho cited Arkan\u2019s age and otherwise clean record in imposing the sentence, telling the Turkish-born businessman that his immigrant success story \u201cexemplifies the American dream.\u201d",
      "\u201cI hope that you don\u2019t let this one mistake define you,\u201d Ho told Arkan.",
      "Arkan faced up to six months in prison under federal sentencing guidelines, but prosecutors and the federal probation officer agreed that no prison time was warranted. In addition to probation, he must also pay a $9,500 fine and $18,000 in restitution.",
      "Arkan pleaded guilty in January to a conspiracy charge in Manhattan federal court. Weeks later, President Donald Trump\u2019s Justice Department pressured prosecutors to drop their underlying case against Adams, ultimately getting it dismissed.",
      "In court Friday, Arkan\u2019s lawyer Jonathan Rosen blasted the government for continuing to pursue his case after getting Adams\u2019 charges dismissed.",
      "\u201cTo put it mildly, this is a very unusual case. In fact, it is unprecedented,\u201d Rosen argued.",
      "In February, Justice Department leadership ordered Manhattan federal prosecutors to drop Adams\u2019 case, arguing that it was hindering the Democratic mayor\u2019s ability to assist the Republican administration\u2019s immigration crackdown.",
      "Ho, who also oversaw the mayor's case, dismissed his charges in April. In a written opinion, he agreed it was the only practical outcome but also criticized what he said was the government\u2019s \u201ctroubling\u201d rationale for wanting the charges thrown out.",

      "Arkan acknowledged in his January plea that he knowingly violated the law by reimbursing employees of his construction firm for their donations to Adams\u2019 campaign.",
      "In brief remarks Friday, he apologized to city taxpayers who bankroll the matching funds program, telling Ho: \u201cI love this city. I dedicated my life to making it better. It pains me that I have harmed it.\u201d",
      "According to prosecutors, Adams personally solicited donations from Arkan and a Turkish consular official at an April 2021 dinner. The following month, Arkan held a fundraiser at the headquarters of his construction company, KSK, in which 10 employees donated between $1,200 and $1,500 to the campaign. They were later reimbursed by Arkan, making them illegal straw donations.",
      "Adams then used those funds to fraudulently obtain public money under the city\u2019s matching funds program, which provides a generous match for small-dollar donations, prosecutors allege.",
      "A well-known member of New York\u2019s Turkish community, Arkan\u2019s ties to Adams first emerged in November 2023 after federal investigators searched the businessman\u2019s home, along with the home of Adams\u2019 chief fundraiser and his liaison to the Turkish community.",
      "Adams pleaded not guilty to bribery and other charges after a 2024 indictment accused him of accepting illegal campaign contributions and travel discounts from a Turkish official and others \u2014 and returning the favors by, among other things, helping Turkey open a diplomatic building without passing fire inspections.",
      "At a Feb. 19 hearing that precipitated the dismissal of his case, Adams told Ho: \u201cI have not committed a crime.\u201d The first-term mayor, a former police captain, skipped the June Democratic primary and is currently running for reelection as an independent.",

      "The three hadn't produced music together in seven or eight years, but returning to work with them \"felt like catching lightning in a bottle,\" Swift said.",
      "\"By the time we came back together, I feel like we had so much more dexterity to what we do,\" she said. \"This was the time where it felt like all three of us in the room were carrying the same weight as creators and it was really special.\"",
      "Martin and Shellback have also worked with pop artists like Britney Spears, Ariana Grande, P!nk and more.",

      "\"The Life of a Showgirl\" theme",
      "Swift described the theme of \"The Life of a Showgirl\" as \"everything that was going on behind the curtain\" during the Eras Tour.",

      "\"Every single song is on this album for hundreds of reasons. \u2026 It's just right,\" she said. \"That focus and that kind of discipline with creating an album and keeping the bar really high is something I've been wanting to do for a very long time.",
      "\"I tend to love to write lots and lots of music, so it's a temptation to release lots of music. I wanted to do an album that was so focused on quality and on the theme and everything fitting together like a perfect puzzle.\"",
      "Melodies and lyrics were key goals",
      "Swift opened up about the primary objectives she had making \"The Life of a Showgirl.\"",
      "\"My main goals were melodies that were so infectious that you're almost angry at it and lyrics that are just as vivid but crisp and focused and completely intentional,\" she said.",
      "Martin had made a point to tell Swift he didn't want her to leave behind the type of writing and storytelling she did on \"folklore\" (released in July 2020) even if the sound of this album was different. Swift said she replied, \"I couldn't if I tried.\"",
      "\"So it was really amazing that we were able to, without doing too much overthinking, we were able to get in there and it was just ideas flying and all of these ideas were like, we've been waiting years to come back together and make this project.\"",

      "Swift wanted the cover to show something offstage to represent the theme of the album.",
      "\"This album isn't really about what happened to me on stage, it's about what I was going through offstage,\" she said. \"It's the life beyond the show.\"",

      "Swift appeared on the prerecorded podcast released Wednesday, which is hosted by Travis Kelce and his brother, former Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce. The episode marks the couple's first comprehensive media appearance.",
      "\"This podcast did a lot for me,\" Swift said. \"It gave me a boyfriend!\"",
      "Kelce attended Swift's Eras Tour stop at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, in 2023. At the time, Kelce shared on the podcast, he tried to give her a friendship bracelet with his phone number; however, she never received it.",
      "Swift said Wednesday that the gesture made her feel \"like I was in an '80s John Hughes movie, and he was just like, standing outside of my window with a boom box being like, 'I want to date you.'\"",
      "Swift also spoke about buying back the master recordings from her first six studio albums. Swift described how she had wanted to own all her music after signing a record deal at age 15. She revealed that she sent her mother and brother to Los Angeles to talk with private equity company Shamrock Capital, which owned the masters at the time, about buying them.",
      "\"A couple months after the Super Bowl in Kansas City, I get a call from my mom,\" Swift said. \"She's like, 'You got your music.' I very dramatically hit the floor for real. Bawling my eyes out, weeping, like 'Really!?' I said to myself, 'Go tell Travis in a normal way,' he was playing video games, and he put his headset down. I was like, 'I got my music back!' And I was heaving crying. This changed my life.\"",

      "\"I have parameters. There's do's and dont's,\" Swift said. \"It points to my music... It's something you don't know why I'm saying for a specific reason, but then you'll look back and go, 'Oh my God.'\"",
      "Swift revealed a recent Easter egg on the podcast about the descending orange door that appeared as a visual on the Eras Tour after the finale song, \"Karma.\"",
      "\"I would leave the stage every night going down the elevator, lift,\" Swift said. \"That's how every single Eras show ended \u2014 except for the last one, where I exited through a door, an orange door, to be specific. And that actually was an Easter egg. Basically the reason why I chose to exit that way is because I kind of wanted to give a little subliminal hint to the fans that I may be leaving the Eras Tour era, but I was also entering a new era.\"",
      "Swift said her upcoming album \"was something that I was working on while I was in Europe on the Eras Tour.\"",

      "Swift's last rerecording, \"1989 (Taylor's Version),\" arrived in October 2023, just four months after the release of \"Speak Now (Taylor's Version).\" That was the same year Swift claimed the record for the woman with the most No. 1 albums in history.",

      "\"I'm a frustrated percussionist, so I take it out on the piano,\" the musician once said in his website biography.",
      "His first Grammy win came in 1975 for the album \"The Sun of Latin Music,\" and he kept releasing music into his 80s, performing through the coronavirus pandemic via livestreams.",
      "In a 2011 interview with The Associated Press, when asked if he had anything important left to do, he responded with his usual humility and good humor: \"Learning to play the piano well. ... Being a piano player is one thing. Being a pianist is another.\"",
      "Palmieri dabbled in tropical music as a pianist during the 1950s with the Eddie Forrester Orchestra. He later joined Johnny Segu\u00ed's band and Tito Rodr\u00edguez's before forming his own band in 1961, La Perfecta, alongside trombonist Barry Rogers and singer Ismael Quintana.",
      "La Perfecta was the first to feature a trombone section instead of trumpets, something rarely seen in Latin music. With its unique sound, the band quickly joined the ranks of Machito, Tito Rodr\u00edguez, and other Latin orchestras of the time.",
      "Pioneering Grammy winner's career spanned decades and genres",
      "Palmieri produced several albums on the Alegre and Tico Records labels, including the 1971 classic \"V\u00e1monos pa'l monte,\" with his brother, Charlie, as guest organist. Charlie Palmieri died in 1988.",
      "Eddie's unconventional approach would surprise critics and fans again that year with the release of \"Harlem River Drive,\" in which he fused Black and Latin styles to produce a sound that encompassed elements of salsa, funk, soul and jazz.",
      "Later, in 1974, he recorded \"The Sun of Latin Music\" with a young Lalo Rodr\u00edguez. The album became the first Latin production to win a Grammy.",
      "The following year he recorded the album \"Eddie Palmieri & Friends in Concert, Live at the University of Puerto Rico,\" considered by many fans to be a salsa gem.",
      "In the 1980s, he won two more Grammy Awards, for the albums \"Palo pa' rumba\" (1984) and \"Solito\" (1985). A few years later, he introduced the vocalist La India to the salsa world with the production \"Lleg\u00f3 La India v\u00eda Eddie Palmieri.\"",
      "Palmieri released the album \"Masterpiece\" in 2000, which teamed him with the legendary Tito Puente, who died that year. It was a hit with critics and won two Grammy Awards. The album was also chosen as the most outstanding production of the year by the National Foundation for Popular Culture of Puerto Rico.",
      "During his long career, he participated in concerts and recordings with the Fania All-Stars and Tico All-Stars, standing out as a composer, arranger, producer, and orchestra director.",
      "In 1988, the Smithsonian Institute recorded two of Palmieri's concerts for the catalog of the National Museum of American History in Washington.",
      "Yale University in 2002 awarded him the Chubb Fellowship Award, an award usually reserved for international heads of state, in recognition of his work in building communities through music.",
      "In 2005, he made his debut on National Public Radio as the host of the program \"Caliente,\" which was carried by more than 160 radio stations nationwide.",
      "He worked with renowned musicians such as timbalero Nicky Marrero, bassist Israel \"Cachao\" L\u00f3pez, trumpeter Alfredo \"Chocolate\" Armenteros, trombonist Lewis Khan, and Puerto Rican bassist Bobby Valent\u00edn.",
      "In 2010, Palmieri said he felt a bit lonely musically due to the deaths of many of the rumberos with whom he enjoyed playing with.",
      "As a musical ambassador, he brought salsa and Latin jazz to places as far afield as North Africa, Australia, Asia and Europe, among others.",

      "The paper looked at nationally representative data from 2005 and 2023 to examine changes in young adults' experiences reaching major life events, such as moving out of their parents' house, getting married, and having a child. Researchers found a dramatic shift in the attainment of these milestones in recent decades.",
      "The reason for this, according to the paper, is that more young adults between the ages of 25 and 34 are facing economic barriers compared with previous generations. Changing societal attitudes around family formation are also contributing to the sharp decline in the share of young people reaching what the U.S. Census Bureau considers to be \"key milestones.\"",
      "According to the working paper, \"Changes in Milestones of Adulthood,\" almost half of all young adults in 1975 had reached four milestones associated with adulthood: moving out of one's parents' home, getting a job, getting married and having a child.",
      "Five decades on, that progression has changed dramatically. The share of young adults that have followed the traditional pathway to adulthood has dropped to less than a quarter, according to the paper.",
      "\"...Living arrangements, economic opportunities and attitudes toward family formation have not been experienced in the same fashion across generations of young adults,\" the working paper reads. \"Increases in job turbulence and economic downturns, for example, have resulted in some young adults navigating more volatile and uncertain economic environments.\"",
      "Economic conditions, combined with changing cultural norms, \"have implications for how young people develop their identity as adults,\" the paper states.",
      "This redefinition of young adulthood comes as the cost of everyday essentials, including housing, food, gas and daycare rises. As a result, more Americans are choosing to forego having a family, in some cases because they deem such choices unaffordable, the study finds.",
      "Researchers measured changes in the achievement of individual milestones, too. While one-quarter of young adults achieved all four milestones, 28% met two economic milestones \u2014 moving out of their parents' homes and finding jobs.",

    "summary": "A new report from Deloitte shows the average cost for a packed lunch is now $6.15, up nearly 3% from 2024. But that all depends on what you buy.",
    "story": [
      "Depending on the items you choose, your child's lunch sandwich could cost more this school year than it did in 2024.",
      "That's according to a new report from Deloitte that shows the overall cost of homemade lunches is on the rise. The average cost for a packed lunch is now $6.15, according to Deloitte, up nearly 3% from $5.99 last year. Just under half of the parents polled by the survey said they expect their child's lunch to cost more this September than it did in 2024.",
      "The reason for the price increase, as the Deloitte report points out, is because the cost of groceries has climbed in recent years. Parents are now paying more for staples like whole milk, which is up 7.8% from a year ago, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data for July, as well as for bananas, which are up 7.2%.",
      "The Consumer Price Index report for July, released earlier this week by the BLS, shows\u00a0that overall grocery prices are up 2.2% compared with last year.",
      "Some foods are cheaper",
      "Not all food prices have gone up; in fact, some food items are cheaper this year. In terms of specific lunch items, CBS' price tracker shows that the cost of white bread is actually 6% lower than it was in 2024.",
      "While the cost of American cheese is up 0.7% from July 2024, according to BLS data, it is down 2.6% from last month.",
      "Iceberg lettuce is 3.9% lower in cost than it was a year ago, according to July CPI data, while the price of romaine lettuce is 4.6% higher.",
      "Tomato prices are also down. The fruit commonly consumed as a vegetable cost 7.8% less per pound in July than it did a year ago.",
      "The overall higher sticker prices at supermarkets has been a major pressure point for Americans, half of whom say the cost of groceries is a\u00a0\"major\" source of stress\u00a0in their life right now, according to a poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "In response to their anticipation of higher lunch prices, caregivers plan to switch from name brands to store brands, choose cheaper sandwich options, and cut down in other household expenses to free up more cash for groceries, according to Deloitte's survey, which polled 1,203 caregivers of school-aged children.",
      "Frugal food shopping in the U.S. has \"generally been on an upward trend since October 2024,\" the report found, though it is still lower today than its peak in 2023.",
      "Cafeteria lunch crunch",
      "It's not just brown bag lunches that could end up costing families more. Cafeteria lunches, which tend to be cheaper than brown bag lunches, could also see a price hike this year.",
      "According to Tuesday's CPI data, the price of food at elementary and secondary schools is up 3.3% since July of last year. To account for inflation, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last month that it would funnel more money into the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs \u2014 which provide healthy, low-cost or free meals to children.",
      "To be sure, not everyone will end up paying full price for cafeteria school lunches. In Deloitte's survey, more than half of respondents said their school offers free lunch, regardless of income.",
      "School meal prices range from $2.95 for elementary school to $3.20 for high school a\u00a0survey\u00a0conducted by School Nutrition Association found.",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Aug 2025 14:50:37 -0400",
    "summary": "As Social Security celebrates its 90th anniversary, concerns are growing over its funding and recent staffing cuts.",
    "story": [
      "Social Security celebrated its 90th anniversary Thursday, marking a major milestone for the program that supplies monthly benefit checks to almost 70 million senior citizens, disabled people and surviving family members of deceased workers.",
      "When President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law on Aug. 14, 1935, he guaranteed for the first time that workers could rely on continuing income in retirement after they turned 65. As it enters its 10th decade, the program is only growing in importance amid an aging population, with a record number of Americans now collecting benefits.",
      "In the next 10 years, Social Security is expected to swell by an additional 12 million recipients, according to the AARP. But even as it grows in importance, the program is also facing mounting problems and growing questions over its long term viability.",
      "While many policy experts believe the program should be expanded, its outgoings now far outpace its income. Some Democratic lawmakers are also questioning the agency's ability to serve retirees after the Trump administration earlier this year made cuts to its workforce in what the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities referred to\u00a0as the \"largest staffing cut in SSA's history.\"",
      "As these challenges have mounted, faith in the program has deteriorated, even as three-quarters of Americans say they believe Social Security is \"one of the most important programs\" the government offers, according to a recent AARP survey. Confidence in the future of Social Security has declined by 7% in the last five years, from 43% in 2020 to 36% in 2025, it found.",
      "Asked about these concerns, the Social Security Administration pointed to a Fox News interview Thursday with its commissioner, Frank Bisignano, who said he's optimistic about the program's future and that the agency is working on improving its operations.",
      "The White House also took issue with the criticisms, with spokeswoman Liz Huston telling CBS News that the administration is improving customer service and \"preventing illegal aliens from accessing benefits. \"President Trump has made Social Security great again,\" she said.",
      "Funding woes",
      "A major headwind facing Social Security may not be new, but it is fast approaching: The possible insolvency of its trust funds as the gap between its revenue and expenditure grows.",
      "For instance, in 2024, the program cost $1.49 trillion, but total income was $1.42 trillion, according to the 2025 Social Security Board of Trustees' report.",
      "Because of that trend \u2014 which is expected to continue given the aging population \u2014 the Social Security trust funds are forecast to be\u00a0depleted by 2034, one year sooner than previously forecast, according to the most recent trustees' report. This so-called \"go-broke\" date has been a major source of stress for Americans who worry that there won't be enough money left by the time they reach retirement age.",
      "While some workers believe that the trust funds' insolvency means Social Security will cease making payments after that date, that is incorrect. Because the program is funded through payroll taxes, Social Security has a constant stream of income \u2014 although without the trust funds' financial cushion, the program will face a shortfall, leading to a cut in benefits.",
      "Without a fix, monthly benefits could be cut by as much as 23%, the Social Security Board of Trustees warned in its 2025\u00a0annual report.",
      "But there are options for shoring up the trust funds. For one, there's a current cap on the amount of income subject to Social Security taxes, which stands at $176,100 in 2025, meaning any earnings above that amount are exempt from the payroll tax.",
      "One remedy would be to lift the cap on payroll taxes, an option that some Democratic lawmakers prefer. Another idea, floated by some Republican lawmakers, is to raise the retirement age, which currently stands at 67 for people born after 1960.",
      "Changes under President Trump",
      "President Trump has vowed not to cut Social Security, noting in a \"Meet the Press\" interview in December that \"we're not touching Social Security, other than we might make it more efficient.\" Nonetheless, concerns have mounted over the Trump administration's changes to the program, including cuts to its staff and the closure of some field offices.",
      "During a press call Wednesday organized by advocacy groups, Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, claimed Mr. Trump and others in his administration are \"working overtime to try to dismantle Social Security.\"",
      "Many Americans also say they're worried about what sort of changes the new administration could make. According to a new\u00a0survey\u00a0from NerdWallet, 61% of Americans believe Social Security benefits will be cut under the current administration.",
      "The White House, however, contends that Social Security has become more efficient under Mr. Trump's leadership. In a statement released Thursday, the White House claimed that the agency is handling 70% more calls than last year and that it has cut down on wait times with the help of technology. It also said the average wait times for customers at field offices have declined by 23%.",
      "\"We have taken steps to reduce wait times, enhance security, and make it easier to navigate our programs,\" SSA commissioner Frank Bisignano wrote in an opinion piece for Fox News on Thursday. \"All the while ensuring we pay benefits accurately to those who are eligible to receive them.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Thursday repeated his\u00a0promises to protect the program.",
      "The program will become \"stronger, bigger and better\" and is \"gonna be around a long time\" with Republicans in charge, he added in remarks from the White House.",

      "As recently as 2021, almost half of all U.S. mansions \u2014 homes with at least 5,000 square feet of livable space \u2014 cost $1 million or less. But today, only a handful of cities still offer top-end homes at that price range, according to a new Zillow\u00a0analysis of home prices across the U.S.",
      "Nationwide, mansions are selling for a median price of $1.4 million, but in some parts of the country, high-end properties fetch far more. In four major California cities, including Los Angeles and San Francisco, the median mansion has a price tag of $4.5 million, Zillow said.",
      "In four metro areas, though, homebuyers can snap up an extra-large residence for under $1 million:",

      "For those willing to trade location for space, mansion values also hover around or slightly more than $1 million across the Midwest and in some Southern cities as well, including Louisville, Kentucky and Birmingham, Alabama, according to Zillow.",
      "\"In general, mansion prices move with general affordability. So in places like Buffalo, Indianapolis, Cleveland and Memphis, in the broad scheme of the U.S., these markets tend to be relatively more affordable,\" Zillow senior economist Kara Ng told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So it makes sense you could find a typical mansion for under $1 million in those regions.\"",
      "Many mansions that below the $1 million mark are less expensive because they are older homes, with a median construction year of 1985 versus 2000 for the median construction year for all mansions, Zillow said.",
      "In 2021, nearly half of all U.S. mansions were worth less than $1 million. Today, just three in 10 fall below the $1 million threshold, according to the report.",
      "Mansions \u2014 and homes in general \u2014 are most costly on the coasts. In San Jose, the median mansion is valued at $6.5 million, for example. \"The coasts tend to be on the pricier side, and that follows general affordability trends,\" Ng said. \"It's hard to build due to geographical constraints, and housing deficits in these areas tends to put upward pressure on prices.\"",
      "To be sure, homebuyers in every price range are getting less for their money, with the median U.S. home sale price reaching\u00a0a record of nearly $400,000 in June, according to Redfin. Tight inventory and high mortgage rates has made it tougher for would-be buyers to enter the property market.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Aug 2025 12:59:01 -0400",
    "summary": "Here's what new data from the producer price index says about where inflation is headed, according to economists.",
    "story": [
      "The producer price index, or PPI, surged last month, far outpacing economists' forecasts and suggesting that President Trump's tariffs are starting to significantly drive up the cost of imported goods.",
      "Wholesale inflation rose 0.9% in July from the prior month, the Labor Department said Thursday, outstripping economists' expectations for a 0.2% increase. The jump marks the largest in more than three years, since June 2022.",
      "The PPI, which measures price changes before they reach consumers, suggests cost hikes are on the way for shoppers, economists said.",
      "So far in 2025, consumer prices\u00a0have been slow to rise despite economists' warnings that Mr. Trump's wide-ranging tariff agenda would hike costs for both U.S. businesses and consumers. That's partly because some importers took steps to offset the impact by preordering inventory and absorbing some tariffs to shield consumers in the short term.",
      "But because those were stop-gap measures, economists have warned consumers are unlikely to be insulated from tariff-driven inflation indefinitely. The latest PPI data underscores that higher prices are rippling through the economy, experts say.",
      "\"Tariff-exposed goods are rising at a rapid clip, indicating that the willingness and ability of businesses to absorb tariff costs may be waning,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a research note Thursday, noting that the wholesale price increases were broad-based.",
      "\"We anticipate broader signs of tariff-driven inflation in the data over time as inventories roll over and firms adjust pricing under margin pressure,\" they said.",
      "The PPI report comes two days after July's Consumer Price Index was slightly cooler than economists had expected, rising 2.7% on an annual basis. The CPI measures changes in prices for goods and services typically bought by consumers.",
      "The PPI report \"indicates that the new tariffs are continuing to generate cost pressures in the supply chain, which consumers will shoulder soon,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics chief U.S. economist Samuel Tombs said in a research note Thursday.",
      "What does the PPI mean for the Fed?",
      "The data complicates the decision the Federal Reserve faces at its Sept. 17 meeting about whether to hold or cut its benchmark interest rate, according to economists.",
      "The central bank has held the rate steady since December 2024, with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell noting that the economy remains relatively solid and that it wants to take a \"wait and see\" approach to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "The Fed is tasked with keeping inflation low while also promoting full employment \u2014 a two-pronged goal known as its dual mandate.",
      "Because the CPI report came in cooler than expected, the Fed had been seen as more likely to cut rates next month. But the latest PPI data may put that in doubt, given a rate cut would make it cheaper for businesses and consumers to borrow, thereby potentially further stoking inflation.",
      "\"After a string of data pointing to greater odds of a September rate cut, the large upside surprise in producer prices highlights the dilemma the Federal Reserve faces in judging the risks to its dual mandate,\" Matthew Martin, of Oxford Economics wrote. The group expects the Fed to hold off on rate cuts until December.",
      "The PPI data \"suggests inflation isn't the non-story some people thought it was after Tuesday's CPI print,\" Chris Larkin, managing director of trading and investing at Morgan Stanley's E*TRADE, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Aug 2025 11:32:30 -0400",
    "summary": "Americans are reining in their spending at fast-food restaurants as they continue to face economic uncertainty.",
    "story": [
      "The most important meal of the day is also shaping up to be the most skipped meal of the day, at least according to two of the country's largest fast-food chains.",
      "McDonald's and Wendy's last week, during their respective earnings calls, said they're seeing sluggish breakfast sales. The companies attributed the trend to heightened economic uncertainty and pressures facing low-income consumers.",
      "\"There is a lot of anxiety and unease with that low-income consumer,\" McDonald's CEO Christopher Kempczinski said on the company's earnings call on Aug. 6.",
      "Despite wage gains, real incomes are down for low-income consumers, who are facing a lot of financial stress, the CEO said, citing President Trump's tariffs as a potential contributor.",
      "\"So real incomes are down with the low-income consumer, that absolutely is going to put pressure on visits into the [quick-service retail] industry. Second thing is there is a lot of anxiety and unease with that low-income consumer. I think we could all speculate the reasons for that, probably tariffs and the impact that, that might have, questions around employment situation,\" Kempczinski said.",
      "According to Kempczinski, the decline in traffic from low-income consumers \u2014 a core demographic for fast-food restaurants \u2014 is an industrywide trend, with breakfast menus across the quick service industry taking the biggest hit.",
      "Why skip breakfast?",
      "As many Americans rein in discretionary spending, industry analysts and executives say one of the first items on the chopping block is breakfast. Instead of heading to the drive-thru for a breakfast sandwich, more Americans are opting to grab something at home, or skip the meal altogether.",
      "\"When consumer uncertainty increases and consumers choose to eat another meal at home, breakfast is often the first place that they do that with,\" Wendy's interim CEO Ken Cook said on the company's earnings call Aug. 8.",
      "That's a stark contrast to the breakfast boom fast-food chains have enjoyed for nearly a decade, which led many restaurants over the years to expand their early morning offerings. Starbucks, which launched egg bites in 2017, now has a breakfast menu with 12 separate items. Wendy's\u00a0reintroduced\u00a0breakfast in 2020 and offers 10 items with eggs.",
      "The cost of fast food has also skyrocketed over the past decade,\u00a0according\u00a0to 2024 report by FinanceBuzz. The personal finance site found that the price of a McDonald's Quarter Pounder with Cheese meal from McDonald's more than doubled in price from $5.39 in 2014 to $11.99 in 2024.",
      "To be sure, reports of slowing traffic at fast-food chains have preceded the recent decline in breakfast sales. On an earnings call in May 2024, McDonald's CEO Kempczinski expressed \"heightened anxiety\" about how the economy was weighing on lower- and middle-income Americans. During that same time, the CEO of Dine Brands, which owns Applebee's and IHOP,\u00a0told\u00a0CNBC that casual restaurants were also seeing a drop in low-income customers.",
      "Still, not all fast-food chains are experiencing declines in breakfast traffic. Both Starbucks and Dunkin' told CBS MoneyWatch they've seen success with breakfast sales.",
      "Reached for comment by CBS MoneyWatch, both McDonald's and Wendy's pointed to their earnings reports.",
      "What falling breakfast sales say about the economy",
      "Experts say that American consumers' decision to skip out on breakfast points to myriad economic pressures facing low- and middle-income consumers ranging from sky-high credit card interest rates to inflation.",
      "\"The fact that the breakfast day part is slowing now, in our opinion, speaks to heightened economic uncertainty and the lower consumer confidence that we've seen, and that really escalated as tariff rhetoric came into the picture,\" Matthew Todd, a director at S&P Global Ratings, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The consumer is very value focused, discerning and selective about how they're spending. I think we would say we think breakfast is the easiest meal to cut because consumers can eat something quickly,\" Todd said.",
      "Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, told CBS MoneyWatch that low- and middle-income Americans have been spending more cautiously since the end of last year, in part due to a \"weakening\" labor market. \"That's adding to their nervousness and their caution so far this year,\" he said.",
      "The most recent jobs report showed hiring slowed in July. The Labor Department also sharply revised job growth for May and June down by a combined 258,000, a sign that hiring was weaker than previously estimated. With the revisions, the U.S. added 19,000 jobs in May and 14,000 in June.",
      "Experts also told CBS MoneyWatch that low-income consumers' purchasing power is already under pressure due to inflation \u2014 something they said\u00a0tariffs could exacerbate. The Consumer Price Index in July showed inflation held steady at 2.7% on an annual basis. Restaurant prices are up 3.9% since July of last year and 0.3% from June.",
      "\"If they have to spend more to buy a pair of shoes or get their hair cut, they're gonna have less to spend on everything else again, including breakfast at a fast-food restaurant,\" Zandi said.",

      "The SSA did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "Each fall, the agency uses inflation data from July, August and September to determine the COLA for the next year. The consumer price index (CPI), a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers that tracks the change in prices on everyday items over time, showed that the inflation rate in July held steady at 2.7% on an annual basis, the same as it was in June.",
      "The inflation rate has remained at or below 3% since the start of 2025. However, experts predict it could inch up later in the year as tariffs put more pressure on consumer prices. Alan Detmeister, an economist at UBS, told CBS MoneyWatch that he estimates headline CPI will rise to 3.7% and core CPI will rise to 3.8% by the second quarter of 2026.",
      "Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist at New York City's New School, believes inflation will likely rise and is concerned that a moderate cost-of-living adjustment \"probably won't be enough to cover the inflation rates that we're headed into,\" AARP reported.",
      "Martha Shedden, the president and co-founder of the National Association of Registered Social Security Analysts, echoed that concern, telling CBS MoneyWatch that based on the current way COLA is calculated, the increase\u00a0is \"not keeping up with seniors' true expenses.\"",
      "According the the AARP, the 2.5% COLA adjustment introduced this year boosted the average Social Security retiree's payment by about $49 a month. The average monthly Social Security check for all beneficiaries was $1,861 in June 2025 and $2,005 for retired workers,\u00a0according to the Senior Citizens League.",
      "In addition to the COLA, some senior citizens will also benefit from a provision included in President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" which provides a temporary tax deduction of up to $6,000 for Americans aged 65 and older.",

    "story": [
      "Louisville, Kentucky\u00a0\u2014 GE Appliances plans to shift production of refrigerators, gas ranges and water heaters out of China and Mexico as part of a more than $3 billion investment to expand its U.S. operations in Kentucky, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and South Carolina.",
      "The investment \u2014 the second-largest in the Louisville-based company's history \u2014 is expected to add more than 1,000 jobs while ramping up domestic production and modernizing plants in the next five years.",
      "\"Our long-term strategy is about manufacturing close to our customers,\" said CEO Kevin Nolan. \"With lean manufacturing, upskilling our workforce and automation, the math works for manufacturing in the United States.\"",
      "The majority of GE's appliance production is already in the U.S. and the shift means only that the company will transfer more work to its domestic plants.",
      "GE will relocate production of gas ranges from Mexico to a plant in Georgia, while six refrigerator models now made in China will be manufactured at its Alabama plant, the company said.",
      "In June, the company said it would move production of clothes washers from China to its sprawling manufacturing complex in Louisville. The reshoring announcements come as President Trump tries to lure factories back to the United States by imposing import taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on foreign goods.",
      "Lee Lagomarcino, GE Appliances' vice president of clothes care, told CBS MoneyWatch at the time that high levies on\u00a0imports from China\u00a0under Mr. Trump have compelled it to \"accelerate the decision-making.\"",
      "GE Appliances said Wednesday that the first phase of its new investment will begin at plants in five Southern states \u2014 Kentucky, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina.",
      "\"We are defining the future of manufacturing at GE Appliances by investing in our plants, people and communities,\" Nolan said. \"No other appliance company over the last decade has invested more in U.S. manufacturing than we have, and our $3 billion, five-year plan shows that our commitment to U.S. manufacturing will continue into the future.\"",
      "The multiyear plan includes ramping up production of gas ranges that have been made in Mexico but will shift to the company's plant in LaFayette, Georgia, the company said. Production of six refrigerators now made in China will move to its plant in Decatur, Alabama.",
      "GE's plant in Camden, South Carolina, will add production of electric and hybrid heat pump water heaters, doubling the factory's output and employment once the project is complete, the company said. The plant now produces gas water heaters. Production of the company's electric and hybrid water heaters \u2014 now made in China \u2014 will shift to South Carolina.",
      "In Selmer, Tennessee, its plant will produce two new models of air conditioners.",
      "The latest investment includes the June announcement that GE Appliances will pump $490 million into its Kentucky complex to produce a combo washer/dryer and a lineup of front load washers that are now made in China. In all, production of more than 15 models of front load washers will shift to the company's Louisville complex \u2014 known as Appliance Park, it said.",
      "Once its new plan is fully implemented, GE Appliances will have invested $6.5 billion across its 11 U.S. manufacturing plants and nationwide distribution network since 2016, it said.",
      "Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Wednesday that the investment shows his state's ability to support world-class companies with a skilled workforce and the resources needed to thrive.",
      "\"GE Appliances has established Kentucky as America's destination for advanced manufacturing and job creation, and today's news shows this iconic company's unwavering belief in the commonwealth and the role we play in their success,\" Beshear said.",
      "GE Appliances handles product design and engineering work at its Louisville headquarters but doesn't make all of its products in the U.S. It contracts with other manufacturers, including in China, for some of its production where it doesn't have capacity or needs access to a global supply chain. The company said its core business strategy is to base production in the United States, and investments announced in June and on Wednesday are another step toward achieving that goal.",
      "The company said it's partnering with universities, technical schools and high schools to help ensure that its plants and other facilities have a trained workforce.",
      "\"Infrastructure and tools matter, but they are not enough,\" said Bill Good, vice president of supply chain for GE Appliances. \"America's manufacturing renaissance will be built by people.\"",
      "GE Appliances is a subsidiary of the China-based Haier company.",
      "Overall, GE Appliances says it contributes more than $30 billion annually to the U.S. economy and supports more than 113,000 jobs \u2014 both directly and indirectly \u2014 through its operations, suppliers and distribution network.",

      "Shares of Spirit Aviation Holdings tumbled $1.39, or 39%, to $2.15 in early afternoon trading.",
      "The budget carrier had warned it has \"substantial doubt\" about its ability to continue as a going concern within the next year \u2014 which is accounting-speak for having the resources needed to sustain operations. The cautionary report comes just months after Spirit emerged from\u00a0Chapter 11 bankruptcy.",
      "In a quarterly report issued Monday, Spirit pointed to \"adverse market conditions\" that it's continued to face despite recent restructuring and other efforts to revamp offerings.",
      "That includes weak demand for domestic leisure travel, which Spirit said persisted in the second quarter of its fiscal year \u2014 among other challenges and \"uncertainties in its business operations\" that the Florida-based company expects to continue \"for at least the remainder of 2025.\"",
      "More Americans are cutting back on travel this year because of economic worries, according to a recent LendingTree study.",
      "Known for its no-frills, low-cost flights on a fleet of bright yellow planes, Spirit has struggled to bounce back to profitability and boost resources to compete with rivals since the COVID-19 pandemic. Rising operation costs and mounting debt eventually led the company to seek bankruptcy protection in November. By the time of that Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.",
      "When Spirit emerged from bankruptcy protection in March, the company successfully restructured some of its looming debt obligations and secured new financing for future operations. Spirit has continued to make other cost-cutting efforts since \u2014 including plans to furlough about 270 pilots and downgrade some 140 captains to first officers in the coming months.",

      "Spirit's aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has made the airline an attractive takeover target over the years. But such buyout attempts from budget rivals like JetBlue and Frontier were unsuccessful both before and during the bankruptcy process.",

      "The U.S. stock market is rallying toward records on Tuesday after data suggested inflation across the country was a touch better last month than economists expected.",
      "The S&P 500 rose 1.1% and was on track to top its all-time high set two weeks ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 473 points, or 1.1%, as of 2:46 p.m. Eastern time, while the Nasdaq composite was 1.3% higher and also heading toward a record.",
      "Stocks got a lift from hopes that the better-than-expected inflation report will give the Federal Reserve leeway to cut interest rates at its next meeting in September.",
      "Lower rates would give a boost to investment prices and to the economy by making it cheaper for U.S. households and businesses to borrow to buy houses, cars or equipment. President Donald Trump has angrily been calling for cuts to help the economy, often\u00a0insulting\u00a0the Fed's chair personally while doing so.",
      "But the Fed has been hesitant because of the possibility that Trump's tariffs could make inflation much worse. Lowering rates would give inflation more fuel, potentially adding oxygen to a growing fire. That's why Fed officials have said they wanted to see more data come in about inflation before moving.",
      "Tuesday's report said U.S. consumers paid prices for groceries, gasoline and other costs of living that were 2.7% higher in July than a year earlier. That's the same inflation rate as June's, and it was below the 2.8% that economists expected.",
      "The report pushed traders on Wall Street to increase bets that the Fed will cut interest rates for the first time this year in September. They're betting on a 94% chance of that, up from nearly 86% a day earlier, according to data from CME Group.",
      "The Fed will receive one more report on inflation, as well as one more on the U.S. job market, before its next meeting, which ends Sept. 17. The most recent jobs report was a stunner, coming in much weaker than economists expected.",
      "Some economists warn that more twists and turns in upcoming data could make the Fed's upcoming decisions not so easy. Its twin goals are to get inflation to 2% while keeping the job market healthy, and helping one with interest rates often means hurting the other.",
      "Even Tuesday's better-than-expected inflation report had some discouraging undertones. An underlying measure of inflation, which economists say does a better job of predicting where inflation may be heading, hit its highest point since early this year, noted Gary Schlossberg, market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. That helped cause some up-and-down swings for Treasury yields in the bond market.",
      "\"Eventually, tariffs can show up in varying degrees in consumer prices, but these one-off price increases don't happen all at once,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"That will confound the Fed and economic commentators for months to come.\"",

It said its total revenue and reserve income grew 53% in its first quarter as a publicly traded company, and it topped forecasts.",
      "On the losing side of Wall Street was Celanese, which sank 14.1% even though the chemical company delivered a better profit than expected. It said that customers in most of its markets continue to be challenged, and CEO Scott Richardson said that \"the demand environment does not seem to be improving.\"",
      "Cardinal Health dropped 7.2% despite likewise reporting a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Its revenue fell short of forecasts, and analysts said the market's expectations were particularly high for the company after its stock had already soared 33.3% for the year coming into the day.",
      "Critics say the broad U.S. stock market is looking expensive after its surge from a bottom in April. That's putting pressure on companies to deliver continued growth in profit.",
      "In stock markets abroad, indexes edged up in China after Trump signed an executive order late Monday that delayed hefty tariffs on the world's second-largest economy by 90 days.

      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was expected to rise 2.8% last month, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "On a month-over-month basis, the CPI rose 0.2%, in line with economists' forecasts.",
      "The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in prices on everyday items such as food and apparel over time. So far this year, inflation has stayed at 3% or lower, with\u00a0June's CPI reading at 2.7%, above the Fed's 2% annual target.",
      "So-called core inflation, a measure or CPI that excludes food and energy prices (which are more volatile), rose by 3.1% over the past 12 months, the highest level in five months. Economists polled by FactSet had predicted a 3% increase for that measure.",
      "Food inflation continues",
      "Overall food prices in July rose 0.2% from the previous month, and 2.9% over the past year. The cost of groceries last month rose 0.1% since June and 2.2% on an annual basis.",
      "The data comes as about half of Americans say the\u00a0cost of groceries is a\u00a0\"major\" source of stress in their life right now, while 33% say it's a \"minor\" source of stress, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Only 14% say it's not a source of stress, underscoring the pervasive anxiety most Americans continue to feel about the cost of daily food essentials.",
      "Everyday staples that saw significant cost increases in July include coffee, up 2.6% from June and 14.8% from 2024. Ground beef, rose 2.4% from June and 11.5% from 2024. On a positive note, egg prices fell 3.4% from June, but were still 16.4% higher than they were in July of last year.",
      "Eating out continues to grow more costly as restaurant prices in July increased 0.3% from the previous month and 3.9% since 2024. The data comes as fast-food restaurants continue to report declines in traffic, as higher prices drive consumers away. Wendy's, for example, cut its sales outlook\u00a0last week, pointing to heightened competition and economic uncertainty weighing on its customer base.",
      "Fast-food chains like Wendy's are competing for the attention of low-income consumers who have pulled back on eating out over concerns about the economy. According to a May study from\u00a0Bankrate, among households earning less than $50,000 per year, 44% say they expect to spend less on dining out this year than they did last year.",
      "\"The low-income consumer remains under pressure,\" Sara Senatore, a research analyst at Bank of America, recently told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Gasoline prices, meanwhile, fell 0.5% from June and 9.5% from July 2024, the CPI data shows.",
      "What the experts say about the impact of tariffs",
      "Economists have been watching closely to determine how tariffs might trickle through to the CPI data. For the first several months of the year, the impact appeared to be limited, but June's reading indicated that the levies might be starting to drive up prices in certain categories such as apparel, home furnishings and appliances.",
      "Goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union are now subject to a new round of reciprocal tariffs that went into effect on Aug. 7.",
      "The figures from today's CPI report suggest that while the prices of certain imported goods such as shoes and furniture rose from June to July, the cheaper cost of gas is offsetting some of the impact of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs.",
      "\"There is some sign of tariff pass through to consumer prices but, at this stage, it is not significant enough to ring alarm bells,\" Seema Shah, chief global strategist a Principal Asset Management, said in an email to CBS News after today's CPI report was released.",
      "During a call with media yesterday, Alan Detmeister, an economist at UBS, said the investment bank expects consumers will start to see the direct effects of the tariffs this year or into early next year.",
      "\"It's possible that these tariff-induced price increases are a one-time price level shock that will start coming down early next year,\" said Detmeister. \"We think they're going to be much more lasting.\"",
      "Detmeister expects both core and headline CPI to peak in the second quarter of 2026, with headline CPI at 3.7% and core CPI at 3.8%.",
      "What the inflation data could mean for a Fed rate cut",
      "With the CPI in July rising to annualized rate of 2.7%, inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target rate, however, most analysts say that the possibility of a Fed rate cut in September is likely still on the table.",
      "\"Although core annual inflation is back to its highest level since February, today's CPI print is not hot enough to derail the Fed from cutting rates in September,\" said Shah.",
      "The latest jobs report showed that hiring slowed in July, which could bolster the case for a Fed rate cut.",

A so-called going concern warning is an accounting term that signals a risk that a business might cease operations.",

      "The warning is the latest development in the photography company's storied history, which includes introducing one of the first consumer cameras in the 1880s and mass manufacturing film rolls for hobbyists and professionals alike.

    "summary": "E.J. Antoni, an economist nominated by President Trump to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said the jobs report is flawed.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u00a0is suggesting that the agency suspend its monthly jobs report, an economic staple that is relied upon by the Federal Reserve and U.S. businesses to gauge the health of the economy.",
      "In an interview on Fox News Digital on Monday ahead of his nomination, E.J. Antoni criticized the monthly employment report as flawed and suggested it be replaced with \"more accurate, though less timely, quarterly data.\"",
      "Antoni, who is a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, was tapped by Mr. Trump on Monday to run the BLS after the president\u00a0fired the former commissioner\u00a0earlier this month, blaming her for a disappointing July jobs report. Mr. Trump took issue with large revisions made to the previous month's jobs data, although jobs number revisions are commonly issued by the agency as more accurate data is collected over time.",
      "\"How on earth are businesses supposed to plan \u2014 or how is the Fed supposed to conduct monetary policy \u2014 when they don't know how many jobs are being added or lost in our economy? It's a serious problem that needs to be fixed immediately,\" Antoni told Fox News Digital.",
      "He added, \"Until it is corrected, the BLS should suspend issuing the monthly job reports but keep publishing the more accurate, though less timely, quarterly data.\"",
      "While some survey recipients immediately respond to the BLS' surveys, others report data later, which leads to the monthly revisions. Despite this, the BLS issues its monthly jobs report in order to report employment information in a timely manner, even though it is subject to revisions \u2014 both up and down \u2014 in later reports.",
      "Asked whether the BLS would continue to release monthly jobs reports, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, \"I believe that is the plan and that's the hope, and that these monthly reports will be data that the American people can trust.\"",
      "Leavitt said \"we need to restore new leadership that we trust\" at the BLS, adding that \"we need to look at the means and the methods of how the United States is acquiring this very important data.\"",
      "\"The goal, of course, is to provide honest and good data for the American people to make very important economic decisions on,\" she said.",
      "Responding to the BLS' employment surveys is voluntary for businesses, while the federal government's Office of Management and Budget directs the BLS to release \"robust\" data on basic economic indicators in a \"timely\" manner. But that's become more challenging as fewer people and institutions respond to surveys, experts say.",
      "\"Response rates have declined for nearly every top-tier government statistical survey over the last decade, a trend that accelerated during the pandemic,\" Goldman Sachs economists wrote in an Aug. 11 research note.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced E.J. Antoni as his nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Monday, after he fired the former commissioner earlier this month, blaming her for a weaker-than-expected jobs report.",
      "Antoni is a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, and he holds a doctorate in economics from Northern Illinois University. He's defended Mr. Trump's economic policy moves in the past, including the president's tariff strategy. He has also\u00a0criticized the BLS\u00a0for low response rates and questioned the agency's methodology, calling its health insurance figures \"phoney baloney\" last year and at one point joking that \"the 'L' is silent\" in BLS' name.",
      "\"DOGE needs to take a chainsaw to the BLS...,\" he wrote in a November\u00a0post on X.",
      "\"There are better ways to collect, process, and disseminate data\u2014that is the task for the next BLS commissioner, and only consistent delivery of accurate data in a timely manner will rebuild the trust that has been lost over the last several years,\" he wrote shortly after Mr. Trump fired the former BLS chief.",
      "Mr. Trump nominated Antoni in a Truth Social post, saying he \"will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE.\"",
      "Antoni will need to be confirmed by the Senate. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is currently led by acting Commissioner William Watrowski, who has worked at the agency for decades.",
      "Mr. Trump ordered his administration to terminate Erika McEntarfer, who had been commissioner of labor statistics, on Aug. 1, hours after the release of the July jobs report data. That report showed a sharp slowdown in hiring, along with a steep downward revision to May and June's hiring numbers.",
      "Hours before her firing, Antoni criticized BLS for \"data problems\" and a trend of \"highly problematic\" revisions, though he also touted some figures in the July jobs report, including a jump in employment by native-born Americans and a slowdown in government jobs.",
      "In the wake of McEntarfer's firing, influential ex-Trump strategist Steve Bannon backed Antoni to take over the BLS. Antoni appeared on Bannon's show \"War Room\" on the day the jobs report came out, calling McEntarfer \"incompetent.\" Days later, Bannon said \"we're pushing\" for Antoni to lead the BLS, and called him \"the guy that almost single-handedly took it down by going through their numbers.\"",
      "Announcing McEntarfer's firing in a post on Truth Social, the president claimed \u2014 without evidence \u2014 that she had \"faked the Jobs Numbers before the Election to try and boost Kamala's chances of Victory\" and pledged to replace her \"with someone much more competent and qualified.\"",
      "But Harvard economics professor Jason Furman, a head of the Council of Economic Advisers under former President Barack Obama, was sharply critical of the selection of Antoni,\u00a0saying on X that, \"I don't think I have ever publicly criticized any Presidential nominee before. But E.J. Antoni is completely unqualified to be BLS Commissioner. He is an extreme partisan and does not have any relevant expertise. He would be a break from decades of nonpartisan technocrats.\"",
      "Jessica Riedl, an economist at the conservative Manhattan Institute,\u00a0said on X that she's \"never met EJ Antoni because he is not seen in many DC policy circles. However, the articles and tweets I've seen him publish are probably the most error-filled of any think tank economist right now. I hope we see better at BLS.\"",
      "The jobs report for October 2024, which was released on Nov. 1, 2024, four days before Election Day, showed just 12,000 jobs were created \u2014 far short of the 100,000 forecast for the month \u2014 following two hurricanes and a major labor dispute. The following month, that figure was revised upward, to 36,000. September's jobs report, however, dramatically exceeded forecasts \u2014 254,000 jobs were created, rather than the 140,000 economic analysts had expected. That figure was later revised down to 223,000.",
      "Mr. Trump continued railing against the ousted commissioner and the BLS more broadly in the days after he fired her, claiming in a post on Truth Social last week that the July jobs report had been \"RIGGED,\" though he provided no evidence to support it. The president said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" Tuesday that it's a \"highly political situation.\" And National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett defended the president's decision in an appearance on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" citing a series of revisions and patterns that \"could make people wonder.\"",
      "\"What we need is a fresh set of eyes over at the BLS,\" Hassett said, adding that \"the president wants his own people there so that when we see the numbers they're more transparent and more reliable.\"",
      "McEntarfer had been commissioner for a little over a year and a half, after she was confirmed in a broad bipartisan vote of 86 to 8 by the Senate in January 2024.",
      "The latest jobs report showed employers in July adding a weaker-than-expected 73,000 jobs, with a downward revision of 258,000 fewer jobs created in May and June. Mr. Trump, who often touts the job numbers, called the jobs figures a \"shock\" and the revision a \"major mistake.\" The BLS said in its report that monthly revisions \"result from additional reports received from businesses and government agencies since the last published estimates and from the recalculation of seasonal factors.\"",
      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer acknowledged in an interview for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" earlier this month that \"there are always revisions,\" but he added that \"sometimes you see these revisions go in really extreme ways.\"",
      "\"The president is the president. He can choose who works in the executive branch,\" Greer said.",
      "Meanwhile, some economists and lawmakers have expressed concern over the firing, and a group of former BLS leaders warned that the move \"undermines the valuable work and dedication of BLS staff\" and \"escalates the President's unprecedented attacks on the independence and integrity of the federal statistical system.\" The group called on Congress to investigate the firing.",

      "Bed Bath & Beyond is making a comeback under a slightly different name, more than two years after filing for bankruptcy.",
      "The first Bed Bath & Beyond Home store will open in Nashville on Friday, a new version of the former big box retail store known for selling home furnishings, appliances and more, at mid-range prices. Overseeing the opening is The Brand House Collective, formerly known as Kirkland's, which manages a portfolio of retail stores including Beyond Inc.'s Bed Bath & Beyond Home, Bed Bath & Beyond, Buy Buy Baby and Overstock.",
      "\"We will be testing and learning the right inventory mix by category and by brand, but the look and feel of the stores will be a transition from the original Bed Bath and Beyond stores with a tighter focus on Seasonal Home Decor, Bedroom furnishings, and Bath and Laundry products,\" Starr Hudgens, chief of staff at the Brand House Collective, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Brand House Collective\u00a0announced the opening of the Nashville store late last month.",
      "\"We're proud to reintroduce one of retail's most iconic names with the launch of Bed Bath & Beyond Home, beautifully reimagined for how families gather at home today,\" Amy Sullivan, CEO of The Brand House Collective, said at the time.",
      "To lure former customers back in the door, Brand House said it would honor legacy Bed Bath & Beyond coupons \u2014 the big white and blue paper slips that have long been associated with the company.",
      "Hudgens said that honoring the legacy coupons was \"an opportunity to re-engage consumers.\" Brand Collective will determine the best distribution strategy for coupons as they expand their store base, he said.",
      "Asked whether Brand House plans to open more stores under the Bed Bath & Beyond Home moniker, Hudgens said, \"We are opening four additional Bed Bath and Beyond Home stores in the Nashville market and will be in an aggressive learn and react posture to determine appropriate merchandising, brand, and strategy shifts to make as we plan our opening strategy for 2026.\"",
      "The opening of the Nashville location marks a new chapter for the discount retailer, which struggled to stay afloat amid depressed sales and the takeoff of online shopping. The company finally got into the e-commerce game after naming Mark Tritton, a former top Target executive, as CEO in 2019. But by then the company was too far behind top competitors, according to experts.",
      "The company had over 300 brick-and-mortar locations before closing all of them after it\u00a0entered Chapter 11 proceedings in April 2023. Months later, it announced it would return as an online home furnishings brand under its new owner Overstock.com. In 2024, Overstock.com made a bid to\u00a0sell Bed Bath & Beyond products at over 100 of its Container Store locations in an effort to revive the struggling retail chain with the help of the Bed Bath & Beyond name.",

    "story": [
      "Democrats unveiled a proposal Friday that could give California's dominant political party an additional five U.S. House seats in a bid to win the fight to control Congress next year.",
      "The plan calls for an unusually timed reshaping of House district lines to greatly strengthen the Democratic advantage in the state ahead of midterm elections, when Republicans will be defending the party's fragile House majority.",
      "It amounts to a counterpunch to the Texas Republicans' plan to take five Democratically held seats and redraw them to favor the GOP at the urging of President Trump as he tries to avoid losing control of Congress and, with it, prospects for his conservative agenda in the later part of his term.",
      "The California effort seeks to take five of the state's nine GOP districts and make them more favorable to Democrats. Just like in Texas, however, it is by no means a guarantee that Democrats would win all five of these seats if a new California map becomes law.",
      "Making the shift would likely require an amendment to California's state Constitution. Overhauling the current map that is in law would need to be passed by a two-thirds vote in both the state Assembly and state Senate, and then be approved by California voters in an election.",
      "California lawmakers are scheduled to return to Sacramento on Aug. 18 amid the redistricting talk. The California State Legislature will have a short time span to move forward.",
      "If approved by voters in a special election this November, the California blueprint could nearly erase Republican House members in the nation's most populous state. The Democratic plan is intended to win the party 48 of its 52 U.S. House seats, up from 43 currently.",
      "The proposal was released by the campaign arm of House Democrats, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Democrats in the state Legislature will hold hearings and plan to vote on the new maps next week.",
      "\"This is about more than drawing lines on a map. It's about drawing a line in the sand to stop Texas and Trump from rigging the election,\" state Senate Democratic leader Mike McGuire said in a statement.",
      "New districts have boundaries to boost Democratic edge",
      "While a general notion behind drawing districts is to unite what's called communities of interest \u2014 neighborhoods and cities that share similar concerns or demographic traits \u2014 the proposed remapping would create a jigsaw of oddly shaped districts to maximize Democratic clout.",
      "The 1st Congressional District is currently anchored in the state's conservative far northeast corner and is represented by Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa, a Trump supporter. The district has a nearly 18-point GOP registration edge.",
      "Under the proposal, Democrats would end up with a 10-point registration advantage in the district after drastic reshaping to include parts of heavily Democratic Sonoma County near the Pacific Coast.",
      "In a post on the social platform X, LaMalfa called the proposal \"absolutely ridiculous.\" LaMalfa's first congressional district would include parts of Santa Rosa under the proposed maps, an area that is in Democratic Rep. Mike Thompson's district.",
      "In the battleground 41st District east of Los Angeles, represented by long-serving Republican Rep. Ken Calvert, Democratic and Republican registration is currently split about evenly.",
      "But in the redrawn district, Democratic registration would jump to 46%, with GOP registration falling to 26%.",
      "Other Republicans whose districts would see major changes intended to favor Democrats include Rep. Kevin Kiley in Northern California, Rep. Ken Calvert in Riverside County, Rep. David Valadao in the Central Valley farm belt and Rep. Darrell Issa in San Diego County. Also, embattled Democratic incumbents would see their districts padded with additional left-leaning voters.",
      "\"Well, obviously, Newsom's entire goal was to revert to the era of drawing lines based upon partisan political factors, as politicians draw their lines,\" Kiley told CBS Sacramento earlier Friday.",
      "Kiley's current district covers suburbs, small towns and mountain communities from the Sacramento region to the Eastern California border.",
      "The release of the plan came the same day that Texas Republicans began a second special session to approve new congressional maps sought by Trump.",
      "The GOP's first special session in Texas ended without approving new political maps, thwarted by Democrats who staged a nearly two-week walkout that meant not enough lawmakers were present to pass any legislation. Gov. Greg Abbott then quickly called a second session that started without the necessary quorum to conduct business.",
      "Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Thursday that his state will hold a Nov. 4 special referendum on the redrawn districts.",
      "\"We can't stand back and watch this democracy disappear district by district all across the country,\" Newsom said.",
      "The announcement marked the first time any state beyond Texas officially waded into Trump's fight, though several governors and legislative leaders from both parties have threatened such moves.",
      "Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina, who heads the House GOP campaign arm, said Newsom, a potential 2028 presidential candidate, is \"shredding California's Constitution and disenfranchising voters.\"",
      "\"Californians oppose Newsom's stunt because they won't let a self-serving politician rig the system to further his career,\" said Hudson, who heads the National Republican Congressional Committee.",
      "How will voters react?",
      "Under current law, California has an independent redistricting commission that was approved by voters earlier this century. Newsom has emphasized that the ballot effort would not get rid of the commission, though it would essentially suspend it. If the measure passes, the commission would then resume being able to write maps after the 2030 census.",
      "A big risk for Democrats is whether voters will be open to setting aside district boundaries crafted by the independent commission for ones shaped for partisan advantage.",
      "Some people already have said they would sue over the effort. Republican former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a longtime opponent of partisan redistricting, signaled that he will not side with Democrats even after talking to Newsom. He posted a photo of himself Friday at the gym wearing a T-shirt that said, \"Terminate gerrymandering,\" with a reference to an obscenity and politicians.",
      "\"I'm getting ready for the gerrymandering battle,\" Schwarzenegger said.",
      "House control could come down to a few seats in 2026",
      "On a national level, the partisan makeup of existing district lines puts Democrats within three seats of a majority. Of the 435 total seats, only several dozen districts are competitive. So even slight changes in a few states could affect which party wins control.",
      "New maps are typically drawn once a decade after the census \u2014 the last being in 2020. Many states, including Texas, give legislators the power to draw maps. California is among those that empowers independent commissions with the task.",
      "If approved, a new California map would take effect only if a Republican state does its own redistricting. It would remain through the 2030 elections. After that, Democrats say, they would return mapmaking power to the independent commission voters approved in 2008.",

    "summary": "Attorney General Pam Bondi issued an order Thursday that amounted to a reversal of \"sanctuary\" policies in D.C. The District sued over the order Friday.",
    "story": [
      "After a hearing in the D.C. U.S. District Court Friday, the Justice Department agreed to remove its newly named D.C. emergency police chief and to rewrite a directive ending District of Columbia rules limiting cooperation between its police and federal immigration authorities.",
      "The District of Columbia sued the Trump administration and Attorney General Pam Bondi earlier in the day. D.C. alleges her efforts to scuttle the District's \"sanctuary\" rules curbing local police cooperation with immigration authorities during the federal police takeover are illegal.",
      "Late Thursday night, Bondi named Terry Cole, the administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, emergency police chief in Washington, as part of her sweeping orders to increase federal control over the Metropolitan Police Department.",
      "U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes heard Friday's arguments in the case, which is centered around Section 740 of the Home Rule Act of 1973. That provision allows the president to require the D.C. mayor to provide \"such services of the Metropolitan Police force as the President may deem necessary and appropriate\" for up to 30 days. President Trump invoked Section 740 Monday,\u00a0 placing the D.C. MPD under direct federal control to crack down on crime in the district.",
      "\"I think these are the kinds of issues that should be decided between the district and the government,\" Reyes said. \"If I have to step in, I will.\"",
      "Now, D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith will continue leading the department, according to Yaakov Roth, principal deputy attorney general in the Justice Department. At the end of the hearing, Roth said the Justice Department would make Cole an intermediary between the White House and MPD during the Trump administration's takeover of the city's police. For now, the federal takeover is expected to last 30 days.",
      "Both sides agreed to continue the arguments over immigration policy next week, after the new policies are written.",
      "In a statement Friday evening following the hearing, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said she needed \"to defend our autonomy. We know that our access to democracy is different than anywhere else in America.\"",
      "\"This evening, I am pleased to be able to report that, after a day in court and in accordance with Home Rule, Pamela Smith remains our Chief of Police,\" she said.",
      "On Thursday night, Bondi, whose department is overseeing the 30-day federalization, announced an order terminating some of the \"sanctuary\" immigration policies in the nation's capital.",
      "Under her order, the MPD would temporarily fully cooperate with federal agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other immigration authorities.",
      "Bondi also rescinded guidance issued by D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith just this week that allowed police officers to transport ICE agents and their detainees and to share immigration information during traffic stops. Smith's directive had still barred most local involvement in federal immigration enforcement.",
      "Bondi also removed guidance that prohibited D.C. police officers from searching databases to determine a person's immigration status, even when there's no underlying criminal warrant.",
      "She also suspended District rules that barred local police from arresting individuals based on administrative immigration warrants signed by ICE officials \u2014 not judges \u2014 and from assisting federal agents during such arrests. The now-defunct policy had required officers to have a criminal nexus before carrying out an arrest and prohibited arrests solely based on suspected civil immigration law violations.",
      "Mitchell Reich, an attorney for the D.C. attorney general's office, asked Judge Reyes to block the Trump administration from taking full operational control of MPD and to block Bondi's orders revoking the D.C. police department's non-cooperation with ICE and other federal immigration agencies.",
      "Reyes said that the Home Rule Act does require Bowser to follow White House directives, but the administration cannot fully control every MPD move.",
      "\"The statute would have no meaning at all if the president could just say, 'we're taking over your police department,'\" Reyes said. \"The president can't say, 'Mayor, I'm asking for the services of your entire police department. I need them to be at my beck and call.'\"",
      "Reyes said while the Trump administration can make specific requests of the MPD to do something, it cannot tell MPD not to do something.",
      "\"If the president today called the mayor\u2026 and said, 'I need the services of the MPD to help ICE,' I don't think she could say no,\" Reyes said. \"The statute says the mayor shall, not the mayor can.\"",
      "The judge also expressed skepticism about Bondi's appointment of Cole. Reyes, appointed to the bench by Joe Biden, has at times criticized the Trump administration's actions in its cases before her.",
      "Roth argued that the language in the Home Rule Act is \"broad\" and allows for the White House\u00a0 takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department without judicial review.",
      "In D.C.'s complaint, D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb warned that the Trump administration's \"unlawful assertions of authority will create immediate, devastating, and irreparable harms for the District. Most critically, the order threatens to upend the command structure of MPD and wreak operational havoc within the department, endangering the safety of the public and law enforcement officers alike.\"",
      "While Mr. Trump has raised the possibility of expanding his administration's control of the city's law enforcement beyond the 30-day maximum without congressional approval, Roth said his interpretation of the law was that the federalization would end without intervention from Congress.",
      "\"That's why we want this to be successful,\" Roth said. \"We want this to work well.\"",
      "\"I totally agree that everyone wants this to be successful,\" Reyes replied. \"And my job as I see it is to make sure that it is successful and within constitutional bounds.\"",

The summit concluded with the two leaders striking a positive tone in statements to the media, but they did not announce a ceasefire or any other breakthroughs from the three hours of talks.",

      "Zelenskyy\u00a0spoke with Mr. Trump and European leaders on Wednesday and said he hoped an \"immediate ceasefire\" would be the main focus of the meeting. But Zelenskyy has also warned that \"talks about us, without us, will not work\" for Ukraine. He said he told Mr. Trump and allied leaders that \"Putin is bluffing\" and \"doesn't want peace.\"",

      "Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022, igniting a bloody war that continues to grind on along front lines in the east and in drone\u00a0and missile attacks that have terrorized Ukrainian cities.",
      "When was the Trump-Putin meeting?",
      "Mr. Trump and Putin greeted each other on the airport tarmac a little after 3 p.m. EDT (Alaska is 4 hours behind Eastern Time). They then headed inside to begin their meeting with a small contingent of top advisers. At about 7 p.m. EDT they emerged from the talks and held what was billed as a joint press conference, though they did not take any questions from reporters.",
      "Where was the Trump-Putin meeting?",
      "The meeting between the U.S. and Russian presidents is taking place at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, in Anchorage, Alaska. The location is roughly midway between Washington, D.C., and Moscow.",
      "What did they say after the meeting?",
      "Both leaders spoke to the press after the sitdown but declined to take questions. Neither of them mentioned a ceasefire in Ukraine, which was Mr. Trump's main goal coming into the meeting.",
      "Putin hinted that the two sides had reached \"agreements\" in their talks, but did not specify what they entailed.",
      "The Russian leader said U.S.-Russia relations have \"fallen to the lowest point since the Cold War.\" The Russian leader said Mr. Trump wants to get to the \"crux of the matter\" of the conflict in Ukraine.",
      "Putin, who launched the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, said the \"situation in Ukraine has to do with fundamental threats to our security.\"",
      "Putin said he is convinced that in order to make any settlement lasting long term, \"we need to eliminate all the primary roots, the primary causes of that conflict.\"",

      "\"There were many, many points that we agreed on, most of them, I would say,\" Mr. Trump said. \"A couple of big ones that we haven't quite gotten there but we've made some headway.

    "summary": "Both President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered brief remarks, but took no questions, in Alaska.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin left Alaska Friday without a ceasefire agreement, although both men described the meeting as constructive.",
      "In what was billed by the White House as a press conference following their meeting, Mr. Trump and Putin took no questions, ignoring shouted ones from reporters.",
      "Putin spoke little of Ukraine, focusing on the bond and heritage between the U.S. and Russia, while Mr. Trump said many points were agreed to, and a few are left, regarding Ukraine. The U.S. president plans to call European leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, he said.",
      "Here is a transcript of what Mr. Trump and Putin said:",
      "PUTIN: Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, our negotiations have been held in a constructive atmosphere of mutual respect.",
      "We have very thorough negotiations that were quite useful. I would like to thank once again my American counterpart, for the proposal to travel out here to Alaska. It only makes sense that we've met here, because our countries, though separated by the oceans, are close neighbors. So when we've met, when I came out of the plane and I said, 'Good afternoon, dear neighbor. Very good to see you in good health and to see you alive.' I think that is very neighborly. I think that's some kind words that we can say to each other. We're separated by the strait of Bering, though, there are two islands only between the Russian Island and the U.S. Island. They're only four kilometers apart. We are close neighbors, and it's a fact.",
      "It's also important that Alaska has to do with our common heritage, common history between Russia and the U.S., and many positive events have to do with that territory. Still, there is tremendous cultural heritage, back from the Russian America, for example, Orthodox churches, and a lot of- more than 700 geographical names of Russian origin. During the Second World War, it was here in Alaska that was the origin of the legendary air bridge for the supply of military aircraft and other equipment under the Lend-Lease Program.",
      "It was a dangerous and treacherous route over the vast emptiness of ice. However, the pilots of both countries did everything to bring closer the victory. They risked their lives and they gave it all for the common victory. I was just in the city of Magadan in Russia. And there is a memorial there dedicated to the Russian, the U.S. pilots. And there are two flags, the U.S. flag and the Russian flag. And I know that here as well, there is such a memorial. There is a military burial place several kilometers away from here. The Soviet pilots are buried there who died during that dangerous mission. We're thankful to the citizens and the government of the U.S. for carefully taking care of their memory. I think that's very worthy and noble. We'll always remember other historical examples when our countries defeated common enemies together in the spirit of battle camaraderie and allyship that supported each other and facilitated each other. I am sure that this heritage will help us rebuild and foster mutually beneficial and equal ties at this new stage, even during the hardest conditions.",
      "It is known that there have been no summits between Russia and the U.S. for four years, and that's a long time. This time was very hard for bilateral relations, and let's be frank, they've fallen to the lowest point since the Cold War. I think that's not benefiting our countries and the world as a whole. It is apparent that sooner or later, we have to amend the situation to move on from the confrontation to dialog, and in this case, a personal meeting between the heads of state has been long overdue, naturally, under the condition of serious and painstaking work, and this work has been done.",
      "In general, me and President Trump have very good direct contact. We've spoken multiple times. We spoke frankly on the phone. And the special envoy of the president, Mr. Witkoff, traveled out to Russia several times. Our advisers and heads of foreign ministries kept in touch all the time, and we know fully well that one of the central issues was the situation around Ukraine.",
      "We see the strive of the administration and President Trump personally to help facilitate the resolution of the Ukrainian conflict, and his strive to get to the crux of the matter, to understand this history, is precious. As I've said, the situation in Ukraine has to do with fundamental threats to our security. Moreover, we've always considered the Ukrainian nation, and I've said it multiple times, a brotherly nation. How strange it may sound in these conditions. We have the same roots, and everything that's happening is a tragedy for us, and terrible wound. Therefore, the country is sincerely interested in putting an end to it.",
      "At the same time, we're convinced that in order to, to make the settlement lasting and long term, we need to eliminate all the primary roots, the primary causes of that conflict, and we've said it multiple times, to consider all legitimate concerns of Russia and to reinstate a just balance of security in Europe and in the world on the whole, and agree with President Trump, as he has said today, that naturally, the security of Ukraine should be ensured as well. Naturally, we are prepared to work on that.",
      "I would like to hope that the agreement that we've reached together will help us bring closer that goal and will pave the path towards peace in Ukraine. We expect that Kyiv and European capitals will perceive that constructively and that they won't throw a wrench in the works. They will not make any attempts to use some backroom dealings to conduct provocations to torpedo the nascent progress.",
      "Incidentally, when the new administration came to power, bilateral trade started to grow. It's still very symbolic. Still, we have a growth of 20%. As I've said, we have a lot of dimensions for joint work. It is clear that the U.S. and Russian investment and business cooperation has tremendous potential. Russia and the U.S. can offer each other so much in trade, digital, high tech and in space exploration. We see that arctic cooperation is also very possible, in our international context. For example, between the far east of Russia and the West Coast of the U.S.",
      "Overall, it's very important for our countries to turn the page to go back to cooperation. It is symbolic that, not far away from here, the border between Russia and the US, there was a so-called International Date Line. I think you can step over, literally, from yesterday into tomorrow, and I hope that's- will succeed in that, in the political sphere. I would like to thank President Trump for our joint work, for the well wishing and trustworthy tone of our conversation.",
      "It's important that both sides are result-oriented and we see that the president of the U.S. has a very clear idea of what he would like to achieve. He sincerely cares about the prosperity of his nation. Still, he understands that Russia has its own national interests.",
      "I expect that today's agreements will be the starting point, not only for the solution of the Ukrainian issue, but also will help us bring back business-like and pragmatic relations between Russia and the U.S.",
      "And in the end, I would like to add one more thing. I'd like to remind you that in 2022, during the last contact with the previous administration, I tried to convince my previous American colleague, it should not- the situation should not be brought to the point of no return, when it would come to hostilities and accept it quite directly back then, that is a big mistake. Today, when President Trump is saying that if he was the president back then, there would be no war, and I'm quite sure that it would indeed be so. I can confirm that. I think that overall, me and President Trump have built a very good business-like and trustworthy contact, and have every reason to believe that moving down this path, we can come and assume it better to the end of the conflict in Ukraine. Thank you. Thank you.",
      "TRUMP: Thank you very much, Mr. President, that was very profound, and I will say that I believe we had a very productive meeting. There were many, many points that we agreed on, most of them, I would say, a couple of big ones that we haven't quite gotten there, but we've made some headway. So there's no deal until there's a deal.",
      "I will call up NATO in a little while, I will call up the various people that I think are appropriate, and I'll of course, call up President Zelenskyy and tell him about today's meeting. It's ultimately up to them. They're going to have to agree with what Marco and Steve and some of the great people from the Trump administration who've come here, Scott and John Ratcliffe. Thank you very much. But we have some of our really great leaders. They've been doing a phenomenal job.",
      "We also have some tremendous Russian business representatives here. And I think, you know, everybody wants to deal with us. We've become the hottest country anywhere in the world in a very short period of time, and we look forward to that. We look forward to dealing- we're going to try and get this over with.",
      "We really made some great progress today. I've always had a fantastic relationship with President Putin, with Vladimir. We had many, many tough meetings, good meetings. We were interfered with by the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax. It made it a little bit tougher to deal with, but he understood it. I think he's probably seen things like that during the course of his career. He's seen- he's seen it all. But we had to put up with the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax. He knew it was a hoax, and I knew it was a hoax, but what was done was very criminal, but it made it harder for us to deal as a country, in terms of the business, and all of the things that would like to have dealt with, but we'll have a good chance when this is over.",
      "So just to put it very quickly, I'm going to start making a few phone calls and tell them what happened. But we had an extremely productive meeting, and many points were agreed to. There are just a very few that are left. Some are not that significant. One is probably the most significant, but we have a very good chance of getting there. We didn't get there, but we have a very good chance of getting there. I would like to thank President Putin and his entire team, whose faces who I know, in many cases, otherwise, other than that, whose- whose faces I get to see all the time in the newspapers, you're very- you're almost as famous as the boss, but especially this one right over here.",
      "But we had some good meetings over the years, right? Good, productive meetings over the years, and we hope to have that in the future. Let's do the most productive one right now. We're going to stop, really, 5, 6, 7 thousand, 1000s of people a week from being killed, and President Putin wants to see that as much as I do. So again, Mr. President, I'd like to thank you very much, and we'll speak to you very soon, and probably see you again very soon. Thank you very much, Vladimir.",
      "PUTIN: Next time in Moscow.",
      "TRUMP: Ooh, that's an interesting one. I don't know. I'll get a little heat on that one, but I could see it possibly happening. Thank you very much, Vladimir, and thank you all. Thank you. Thank you.",
      "PUTIN: Thank you so much.",

      "Clinton made the comments on the podcast \"Raging Moderates\" with Jessica Tarlov, as Mr. Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet in Alaska to discuss a possible end to Russia's war in Ukraine.",
      "\"Honestly, if he could bring about the end to this terrible war, where Putin is the aggressor, invading a neighbor country, trying to change the borders \u2014 if he could end it without putting Ukraine in a position where it had to concede its territory to the aggressor, had to, in a way, validate Putin's vision of greater Russia, but instead could really stand up to Putin, something we haven't seen, but maybe this is the opportunity,\" Clinton said.",
      "\"To make it clear that there must be a ceasefire. There will be no exchange of territory. And that, over a period of time, Putin should be actually withdrawing from the territory he's seized in order to demonstrate his good-faith efforts, let us say, not to threaten European security,\" she continued. \"If we could pull that off, if President Trump were the architect of that, I'd nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize, because my goal here is to not allow capitulation to Putin, aided and abetted by the United States. I think that's a terrible, terrible precedent.\"",
      "Clinton added: \"I'm dreaming that for whatever combination of reasons, including the elusive Nobel Peace Prize, President Trump may actually stand up to Putin on behalf of not just Ukraine and its democracy and its very brave people, but frankly, on behalf of our own security and interests.\"",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr and the Ukrainians want a full withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine, including the territories Russia has seized.",
      "Mr. Trump, whose supporters chanted \"lock her up\" about Clinton during the 2016 presidential election, expressed appreciation for his formal rival's remarks. The president told Fox News' Bret Baier on Friday it was \"very nice\" of Clinton to say that, and, \"I may have to start liking her again.\"",
      "Clinton on Friday said she hopes Mr. Trump remembers that he's at the very military base \"that has to send up fighter planes to watch and fend off Russian bombers that routinely harass our military assets, do overflights, engage in provocative behavior in the skies above Alaska.\"",
      "\"I hope he's reminded of that,\" she continued. \"He is not meeting with a friend. He is meeting with an adversary, and an adversary who hopes to play him. And the best thing that could come out of this, frankly, is probably nothing, nothing agreed to, except a real strengthening of President Trump's understanding that Putin is not someone you can make a deal with an expect it to last.\"",

      "As the Environmental Protection Agency moves to revoke the Endangerment Finding, the 2009 scientific determination that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and can be regulated under the Clean Air Act, the Department of Energy published a\u00a0new review of the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on U.S. climate that aims to support the EPA's efforts.",
      "The report was developed this spring by the 2025 Climate Working Group, which is composed of five independent climate scientists selected by Energy Secretary Chris Wright.",
      "But environmental groups and independent scientists have criticized the report and how it was written, claiming it was assembled in secret by the five scientists who are recognized by the larger scientific community as climate skeptics.",
      "\"The secret report was produced by a set of known climate contrarians who were commissioned to write this report that's full of inaccuracies,\" said Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director of climate and energy programs at the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"It's clearly geared towards trying to give the EPA a way to evade its legal responsibility to address the health harms of heat trapping emissions and climate change.\"",
      "A \"secret report\"",
      "The DOE report, entitled \"A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S. Climate,\" was commissioned in March when Wright assembled the group to undertake a massive review of scientific findings in a very short period of time, with no public announcement of this effort.",
      "The five authors delivered their final draft by May 28. In the report's preface, the authors wrote, \"The short timeline and the technical nature of the material meant that we could not comprehensively review all topics.\"",
      "Their report argues that carbon-driven warming may be less economically damaging than commonly believed, and that aggressive U.S. climate policies would have little measurable impact on the global climate. It attributes some warming to natural climate cycles or changes in the sun, instead of the burning of fossil fuels, and also claims sea level rise has not been accelerating, contrary to widely accepted scientific evidence. Finally, it highlights the potential benefits of rising carbon dioxide levels for plant growth.",
      "\"I would say that it presents an incomplete and misleading picture of how climate change is affecting the United States,\" said Phil Duffy, chief scientist at Spark Climate Solutions, who previously worked in the Biden and Obama administrations as a science policy expert.",
      "Duffy and other scientists say the DOE report cherry-picks evidence, misrepresents peer-reviewed research, and ignores the overwhelming consensus that human activity is driving dangerous warming. Numerous climate-based groups and researchers have published their own fact-checks on the report, with one listing more than 100 false or misleading claims made by the authors.",
      "CBS News reached out to the Department of Energy about the criticisms of the report. They responded by referring to Wright's statement in the preface, where he wrote that he chose the panel \"for their rigor, honesty, and willingness to elevate the debate.\"",
      "\"This DOE report is in service of a political goal, it's not credible science,\" said Ben Santer, a climate researcher and board member of the Union of Concerned Scientists. Santer says his own published work was misrepresented in the DOE report and said the authors \"fundamentally twist\" the work of many researchers to reach conclusions that \"will be used for a political purpose.\"",
      "Critics in the scientific community have pointed out that the panel's five authors are known for their contrarian views on climate science, which are often at odds with the scientific consensus on the causes of climate change.",
      "\"The people that were handpicked by the Trump administration's energy secretary are this very small group of people who are known to disagree with that mountain of [scientific] evidence,\" said Vickie Patton, general counsel at the Environmental Defense Fund. \"Some of them have connections to the fossil fuel industry.\"",
      "Accusations of rewriting science",
      "Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former oil and gas executive, has been vocal about his views on climate change, which align with the report's findings. In an op-ed earlier this year, he called climate change \"a by-product of progress,\" and wrote, \"I am willing to take the modest negative trade-off for this legacy of human advancement.\" He argues that while climate change is real, it is not the greatest threat, and that expanding access to affordable, reliable energy should remain the priority.",
      "Wright has been transparent about how he views U.S. climate research, telling CNN's Kaitlan Collins that the administration is reviewing past federal climate reports, including the National Climate Assessment, and may provide \"updates\" later this year, leading many in the scientific community to fear the administration is aiming to edit or censor critical research.",
      "\"It's important that science be allowed to speak for itself and I do have concerns that that's not happening,\" Duffy told CBS News.",
      "National Climate Assessments typically take years to write and are authored by hundreds of scientists.",
      "Duffy says that Wright didn't oversee the previous reports and therefore has no authority to review or revise them. \"He can't rewrite the National Climate Assessment any more than I can rewrite 'The Great Gatsby,'\" Duffy says.",
      "The Environmental Defense Fund and Union of Concerned Scientists filed a lawsuit Tuesday in federal court against the EPA and the Department of Energy, arguing that their actions violated the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which requires transparency and balanced membership for government advisory panels. The suit alleges that the Climate Working Group was created in secret, its work withheld from the public, and then its report was used extensively by the EPA, cited 22 times, to justify repealing the Endangerment Finding. The organizations are asking a judge to block the government's use of the report to comply with transparency laws.",
      "When asked about the lawsuit, the EPA responded in an email saying, \"As a matter of longstanding practice, EPA does not comment on current or pending litigation,\" and referred CBS News to the Department of Energy. The Department of Energy did not respond to any of our requests for comment.",

    "summary": "President Trump visits Alaska Friday for a meeting with Russia's President Vladimir Putin \u2014 a discussion the White House has called a \"listening exercise.\"",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin sit down\u00a0in Alaska Friday for their high-stakes meeting about the war in Ukraine, the two leaders will bring differing ideas about ending the war that Russia began over three years ago. At the same time, Ukraine will be watching from the outside with European allies, hoping that Mr. Trump is protecting their interests.",
      "Their meetings are expected to be capped by a rare joint news conference with the two world leaders \u2014 the first such event of its kind since their 2018 summit in Helsinki, when Mr. Trump sided with Putin over his own intelligence agencies about Russian interference in the 2016 election.",
      "Expectations ahead of the Trump-Putin meeting",
      "Mr. Trump has tried to lower expectations going into the meeting, telling reporters the day before, \"all I want to do is set the table for the next meeting, which should happen shortly.\" The subsequent meeting is an idea he has been floating this week, and he said it would also include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and perhaps other allies. The president raised the possibility that Zelenskyy could even join them in Alaska within a couple of days.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt referred to talks with Putin as \"a listening exercise\" for Mr. Trump and said his goal \"is to walk away with a better understanding of how we can end this war.\"",
      "There are a number of questions going into the summit \u2014 chief among them is what Russia wants, and whether there's a way to reconcile its demands with what Ukraine wants. U.S. and Russian counterparts have been speaking, and Mr. Trump and Putin have had their own phone conversations.",
      "In March, Ukraine agreed to a 30-day ceasefire proposal backed by the U.S., and months later, in May, when the Kremlin had still not accepted the terms, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. was trying to figure out if Russia was just \"tapping us along.\"",
      "By July, casualties were mounting in Ukraine as Russia stepped up its bombing campaign with hundreds of missile and drone strikes. Mr. Trump gave Putin a 50-day deadline to agree to a deal to end the war, and later shortened it to a 10-day deadline, threatening harsher tariffs and secondary sanctions. Dmitri Medvedev, the former president of Russia, responded by mocking Mr. Trump on X. \"Each new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war,\" he said, warning that it would not be \"between Russia and Ukraine, but with [Trump's] own country.\"",
      "But a day before the president's 10-day deadline expired \u2014 and after Putin had met with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff \u2014 the Kremlin announced that Putin and Mr. Trump would meet.",
      "Mr. Trump on Wednesday said there would be \"very severe consequences\" for Russia if it doesn't agree to end the war after Friday's meeting, though he declined to elaborate.",
      "Zelenskyy and European partners met virtually with Mr. Trump Wednesday, after which Zelenskyy wrote on X: \"Together with our partners, we supported the efforts of U.S. President Donald Trump to end the war, stop the killings, and achieve a just and lasting peace. I am grateful to the partners for our shared position: the path to peace.\"",
      "European leaders have been wary of the Trump-Putin meeting. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Wednesday of the summit, \"The most important thing is that Europe convinces Donald Trump that one can't trust Russia,\" adding, \"no one should think of recognizing Russia's right to demarcate borders for its neighbors.\" Zelenskyy won't be there to represent Ukraine's interests, and Mr. Trump has shown he's sometimes reluctant to criticize Putin.",
      "What Russia wants",
      "Experts say Putin has several objectives that won't be shared by the U.S. and Ukraine, and Mr. Trump must exercise caution.",
      "Putin would love to see the U.S. discontinue its financial support for Ukraine, said Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies' Center on Military and Political Power.",
      "\"He wants to sideline the power of the United States so that he can more effectively prey on Ukraine,\" Bowman said, adding that at the same time, Putin will \"try to make the invaded look like the villain.\" While Mr. Trump aims to end the war Russia began, Putin is likely to try to seize on Mr. Trump's desire for peace.",
      "\"He's going to try to gain Trump's support for a bad peace,\" Bowman said, adding, \"Some peace agreements are bad because they lead to more war.\"",
      "John Lough, an associate fellow in the Russia and Eurasia program and the British think-tank Chatham House, predicted that Russia would \"put something in front of [Trump] that he will buy into and say, 'This is a way out of the war, and I like that, and I'm now prepared to go lean on the Ukrainians again and the Europeans and we'll get this over the line.'\"",
      "But Lough also believes that for Russia, the meeting is \"high risk.\"",
      "\"They may not get what they want, but they will at the very least be hoping that it guides the sort of next phase of the process of getting Ukraine to the table, and, I suppose, conducting the negotiations within a framework with which that comes,\" Lough said.",
      "Russia, Lough said, wants \"to get the framework of the peace agreement settled and then talk about a ceasefire, whereas Ukraine, its allies and, to a degree, President Trump has said, 'No, we start with a cease fire and then we build around that.'\"",
      "Daniel Fried, a former U.S. ambassador to Poland and former assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, thinks Putin could try to insert a wedge between the U.S. and its allies.",
      "\"He wants to get out of this meeting without any cost and to slice away at the American position and maybe draw Trump out so that there's a gap between him and Zelenskyy, Trump and the Europeans,\" Fried said in a press call Wednesday.",
      "After Mr. Trump's more skeptical comments about Putin since the meeting was scheduled, Fried said, \"I am less worried about that than I was three days ago.\"",
      "Fried, who is now a fellow at the Atlantic Council, said that for Putin, a great outcome would be to \"dazzle\" Mr. Trump with a fake offer and to walk away with a big smile.",
      "At talks in June, the Kremlin presented a memorandum offering Ukraine two options for a 30-day ceasefire, which could give some insight into Putin's maximalist demands.",
      "The first would have required Ukraine to withdraw its forces from four regions illegally annexed by Russia, but which Russia never fully controlled: Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.",
      "The second option involved a number of conditions including a requirement that Ukraine wind down its military effort, cease receiving military aid, exclude any international military forces from its territory, lift martial law and then swiftly hold an election.",
      "As part of a peace treaty, Russia said it would require international recognition of Russian sovereignty over some Ukrainian territories it currently occupies, including Donbas and Crimea, and a pledge by Ukraine not to join any military alliances \u2014 an end to its efforts to join NATO \u2014 or allow any foreign militaries to operate or have bases in its territory.",
      "Russia also said it would want a cap on the strength of Ukraine's armed forces and for Russian to become an official language in Ukraine.",
      "Wendy Sherman, a former deputy secretary of state who has sat across from Putin before, said the Russian leader has no real interest in ending this war \u2014 he is simply \"buying time.\"",
      "\"This is President Putin's meeting,\" Sherman told CBS News Wednesday. \"He really is in charge of this meeting. He asked for it. The president, I think, was flattered to have this meeting. But Putin has no interest in ending this war. He is very smart, he is very cagey.\"",
      "What Ukraine wants",
      "Ukraine wants an end to Russia's assault and its full withdrawal from their territory.",
      "\"There must be an honest end to the war. And it depends on Russia,\" Zelenskyy said on social media earlier this month. \"It is Russia that must end the war it started.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said earlier this week that a ceasefire agreement between Russia and Ukraine would involve \"some land swapping going on. I know that through Russia and through conversations with everybody. To the good, for the good of Ukraine. Good stuff, not bad stuff. Also, some bad stuff for both.\"",
      "That prompted a response from Zelenskyy, who said Ukraine would not give up any of its territory to Russia. Ukraine's constitution does not allow him to formally cede parts of the country.",
      "\"We will not reward Russia for what it has perpetrated,\" Zelenskyy said in a social media post last weekend. \"The answer to the Ukrainian territorial question already is in the Constitution of Ukraine. No one will deviate from this \u2014 and no one will be able to. Ukrainians will not gift their land to the occupier.\"",
      "Despite such statements, John Herbst, senior director of the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center, said Zelenskyy has demonstrated he's willing to compromise.",
      "\"There is no doubt in my mind that Zelenskyy understands that territorial concessions may be required to get a durable peace,\" Herbst said.",
      "Another major concern is whether Putin, with his deep knowledge of Ukraine, could try to manipulate Mr. Trump, said former intelligence official Andrea Kendall-Taylor, who specialized in Russian affairs.",
      "Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova told CBS News that \"we all understand the reality on the ground, and we are ready to discuss how to end this war.\" She added, \"Let's stop the killings, and let's get to diplomacy.\"",
      "Ukraine and Russia's troubled history",
      "Ukraine was a part of the Soviet Union before voting for independence in 1991.",
      "After the Soviet Union collapsed, the NATO alliance expanded eastward, adding former Soviet republics including Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, and it established a close partnership with Ukraine. In 2008, the alliance declared its intention for Ukraine to join NATO at some point in the future.",
      "Putin has said on numerous occasions that he views NATO's expansion as a threat to Russia. He has also said that he believes Ukraine to be part of Russia politically, culturally and linguistically.",
      "Some Ukrainians, primarily in eastern areas, are Russian-speaking and feel more closely aligned with Russia than the nation of Ukraine. But the majority of Ukrainians speak Ukrainian, feel a deep patriotic connection to Ukraine and have favored developing closer ties to Europe.",
      "Widespread protests erupted in Ukraine in 2014 when the pro-Russian president at the time refused to sign an EU association agreement. The public outrage forced him from office \u2014 an apparent victory for Ukrainians who favored closer ties to Europe. But shortly after, Russia annexed Crimea, a peninsula that was internationally recognized as part of Ukraine, and the Kremlin supported a pro-Russian separatist rebellion in Ukraine's east.",
      "In 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, attacking cities across the country, including the capital, Kyiv. Some expected Russia to quickly take over, but Ukrainians fought hard to defend themselves, Russian gains largely stagnated behind front lines in the east, and the war has raged on ever since.",

First responders and hazmat units were on the scene with four minutes, authorities said.",
      "\"Today's event was under control almost immediately, without incident,\" Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Kaz Daughtry said.",
      "5 letters containing powder were found, FBI says",

      "Debate continues over what's going on at 26 Federal Plaza",
      "The building at 26 Federal Plaza has been the scene of numerous detainments by ICE agents following routine immigration hearings. It has also been the site of several protests, alleging immigrants are being held in deplorable conditions.",
      "DHS maintains the building is not a detention center and says allegations of overcrowding or poor conditions are \"categorically false.\"",
      "\"It is a processing center where illegal aliens are briefly processed to be transferred to an ICE detention facility,\" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a recent statement to CBS News New York. \"All detainees are provided with proper meals, medical treatment, and have opportunities to communicate with their family members and lawyers. As we arrest and remove criminal illegal aliens and public safety threats from the U.S., ICE has worked diligently to obtain greater necessary detention space while avoiding overcrowding.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator.",
      "SEN. DAN SULLIVAN: Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you for joining us in your home state.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Welcome to Alaska. The father of the U.S. Air Force called Alaska the most strategic place in the world. That's a quote by Billy Mitchell that I use a lot. And now you see why.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well \u2014 very strategic. And I want to talk to you about a lot of things specific to the state--",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Good.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014but this is the focus of the world right now\u2014",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: It is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014because of who's coming here.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So from your perspective, you're a supporter of Ukraine\u2014",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: I have been.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014what does a successful Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump, summit look like?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Well, look, I think the President and his team need to be commended. You know, they have put a lot of effort and energy in peace, with regard to Ukraine and Russia, like they're doing all around the world, you know, they're they're making a lot of headway on peace, whether it's the Azerbaijan-Armenia issues, Iran-Israel, Pakistan-India, they're putting a lot of energy into bringing peace to different parts of the world, but they put the most energy into this.",
      "So, look, I think a successful outcome would be, as you know, a com- negotiating peace is very complex, very difficult. Even this kind of high level diplomacy has risks for everybody, including the president and his team. The different elements of a peace agreement, starting with the ceasefire, then you would have territorial issues, concessions or not, then you have security guarantees. But I think this is a place-setting exercise that the administration believes that if they can get a ceasefire, then you would do the other elements that I talked about, the much more complex elements, with Zelenskyy, with our European and NATO allies. So I think the President is going to assess Putin's seriousness on a ceasefire. And if he assesses that, that he's serious, and Putin agrees to a ceasefire, then I think that would be success. Then you move on to the other elements for round two. So this is really preliminary, and I would call it, you know, an exercise in place-setting for the real negotiations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, watch for the ceasefire, and judge success based off of that. Well, the Kremlin has announced there's going to be this joint press conference. The White House says, we'll see, the president said maybe, maybe not. Vladimir Putin is being brought in from the cold. He's been isolated by the world for a reason. Do you think that this is rewarding bad behavior, by giving him this spotlight on the American soil?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Look, two things on that. Vladimir Putin is coming to negotiate with Trump because of the sanctions. I mean, don't take it from me. Listen to our European allies who are definitive on that. The reason Putin is even doing this is because of the threat of serious secondary sanctions. So I think that that is important. And, you know, in terms of American soil, look, I actually think Alaska is the appropriate place. Putin understands one thing, as you know, Margaret, strength and power. And my state exudes strength and power with a huge military here. By the way, we're having a giant military exercise going on right now. I hope Vladimir Putin sees a lot of that military power in the next couple of days. Unleashing American energy, which the President is doing. That's the weapon that Putin fears probably more than anything, when we can compete with them.",
      "And then this is also, you know, a place that demonstrates a huge element of American power and strength, which is our allies. We have allies doing military exercises up here as we speak, the president has been doing a great job with our European allies. Gotten NATO to get to 5%, coordinating with them all week. So I think those are really important. And then finally, you know, as an Alaskan. I think it's important, from the perspective of reminding the Russians that we are quite good negotiators, including the president of the United States. You know, last time we had a big deal with Russia in America, about my state, we got this great state for two cents an acre, $7.2 million, probably the deal of the century. And I think the Russians- I think the Russians probably have to remember that too.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, exactly. Don't you think for Vladimir Putin, who, you know, allegedly wants to reconstitute the Russian Empire, that maybe has a little bit of a different meaning for him, arriving here?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Well, look, I think he has no- I mean, who knows what they think about Alaska, but I know what Alaskans think about Russia. And you know, we're a strong state, like I said. We have enormous power right here. And so again, I think for all these reasons, this is going to be a really important summit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So- he is an indicted war criminal, for a very specific crime of kidnapping Ukrainian children. He's bombed hospitals in Syria. He's massacred people, ordered them at least, he's- he's murdered many of his own people. He's used chemical weapons on British soil. That's why he's under this kind of pressure and U.S. sanctions. Really, are you pleased that he's this close to home?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Look, like I said, I mean the- the part about\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think it normalizes that, that it forgives that, that it brings him back into the fold by giving him that photo op that makes him look so powerful?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: You know, peace is difficult, right? We've had high level discussions with Reagan in Gorbachev, with Stalin, with Mao Zedong. I mean, this is what diplomacy is about, when you try to end wars. And it's- the way you end wars is, you discuss them with the leaders of these countries. Look, I'm no fan of Vladimir Putin. I don't trust anything he says. The key is, when I think what the president has done when you're dealing with a dictator, is show up with strength, and that's what the president's done. Putin is coming to the negotiating tables because he's threatened by these sanctions. The president is rebuilding our military, rebuilding our energy sector, which is critical, critical to my state, and very importantly, as I already mentioned, coordinating really closely with one of the greatest strengths we have, and that's our allies. We are an ally rich nation. Putin is ally poor, and that's a huge strength of ours.",
      "So all of these things, I think, you focus on the strength, get Putin to a ceasefire, and move forward with Ukraine, Zelenskyy, our European allies, in terms of the more complicated elements of a peace negotiation. But it starts with this. Starts with a ceasefire. And look, if President Trump assesses Putin is not being honest, you've seen, you know, a lot of frustration from the president recently saying, hey, I have these good discussions with Putin, then he's out bombing, you know, hospitals and nursing homes. If he assesses that he's not serious, then, as the president said, there'll be severe consequences. And I think that's the kind of pressure we need to keep on to try to get to what everybody wants, which is an end of this war.",

    "story": [
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi on Thursday scrapped local directives that severely limited cooperation between police officers in Washington, D.C., and federal agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other immigration agencies.",
      "The move amounts to a sweeping reversal of \"sanctuary\" policies in the nation's capital, allowing the Metropolitan Police Department, for the time being, to fully cooperate with federal immigration enforcement as President Trump asserts more control over the District of Columbia, citing concerns about crime and disorder. City officials quickly pushed back on the legality of Bondi's order, saying they were not bound by it.",
      "Mr. Trump has cited concerns about criminality and homelessness to launch a high-profile anti-crime crackdown in Washington, deploying National Guard troops and hundreds of agents from federal agencies like the Drug Enforcement Administration, Customs and Border Protection, ICE and the FBI to patrol parts of the city.",
      "Underpinning Mr. Trump's crackdown is an executive order earlier this week that effectively brought the Metropolitan Police Department under federal control by invoking emergency powers that last for 30 days.",
      "Bondi, who was assigned to oversee federal requests for the police department, wrote in a directive on Thursday that she was making Terry Cole, the current head of the DEA, the emergency police chief in Washington. She also cited Mr. Trump's emergency declaration to reverse several local police policies.",
      "\"D.C. will not remain a sanctuary city, actively shielding criminal aliens,\" Bondi said on Fox News Thursday.",
      "Bondi rescinded guidance issued by Washington police chief Pamela Smith earlier Thursday that allowed police officers to transport ICE agents and their detainees and to share immigration information during traffic stops, but that still barred most local involvement in federal immigration enforcement.",
      "She also scrapped guidance that prohibited D.C. police officers from searching databases for the purposes of determining someone's immigration status, even when there's no underlying criminal warrant.",
      "Bondi suspended rules that barred D.C. police from arresting individuals based on administrative immigration warrants signed by ICE officials \u2014 not judges \u2014 and from assisting federal agents during such arrests. The rescinded policy required officers to have a criminal nexus before carrying out an arrest, prohibiting arrests solely based on suspected civil immigration law violations.",
      "Bondi's order paused a local policy that previously blocked D.C. police from transferring noncitizen detainees to ICE, based on so-called \"detainer\" requests issued by the federal agency, unless there was a criminal warrant signed by a judge.",
      "Late Thursday, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser posted a letter authored by District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb, who argued Bondi's directives were not authorized by federal law.",
      "\"It is my opinion that the Bondi Order is unlawful, and that you are not legally obligated to follow it,\" Schwalb said in the letter, which was addressed to Smith, the Washington, D.C. police chief.",
      "Schwalb said police officers in the capital \"must\" continue to follow Smith's orders \"and not the order of any official not appointed by the Mayor.\"",
      "It's also unclear how Bondi's order interacts with a local Washington, D.C. law enacted in 2020 that generally forbids city officials from participating in or assisting federal immigration enforcement, unless there's a judicial warrant.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Aug 2025 20:27:00 -0400",
    "summary": "As Texas hurtles toward a flashpoint on a GOP effort to redraw congressional districts, California Democrats are answering with a plan of their own.",
    "story": [
      "California Democrats are preparing to counter Republicans' attempt to reshape a series of Texas congressional districts for political advantage in a back and forth that could define next year's midterm elections and with it, the final two years of President Trump's second term.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced he is moving forward with a redistricting plan Thursday as national tensions rage over changing congressional lines mid-decade. Districts are usually redrawn after the decennial census, and under California law, the changes would require a special election.",
      "Newsom has vowed his state would respond after Texas Republicans released plans earlier this summer to redraw five seats held by Democrats and make them more favorable to the GOP.",
      "\"California won't stand by and watch Trump burn it all down \u2014 we are calling a special election to redraw our Congressional maps and defend fair representation,\" Newsom said Thursday in a post on X ahead of his remarks.",
      "Newsom, speaking alongside a number of California officials in Los Angeles, said Mr. Trump is \"trying to rig the system,\" adding that \"as a consequence, we need to disabuse ourselves of the way things have been done.\"",
      "\"We have got to recognize the cards that have been dealt,\" Newsom said. \"And we have got to meet fire with fire.\"",
      "The California governor said the effort is happening \"in reaction to a president of the United States that called a sitting governor of the state of Texas and said 'find me five seats.'\"",
      "\"I know they say don't mess with Texas,\" Newsom said. \"Well, don't mess with the great Golden State.\"",
      "Newsom's team participated in a series of conversations with the state's Democratic congressional delegation and the California Legislature as drafts of possible maps were discussed. According to U.S. Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California, the conversations were initially centered on the question, \"Is this even conceptually possible?\"",
      "California Democrats concluded that it was possible to gain five Democratic seats to counter Texas' gains, according to Lofgren. \"I'm confident that if we need to move forward, we will do that successfully. There's tremendous unity on the Democratic side.\"",
      "Republicans currently control both chambers of Congress and hold the White House. At the moment, if Democrats were to win back as few as three seats in next year's midterms, they could flip control of the House. That path would be threatened however if Republicans and Mr. Trump succeed in convincing GOP-led states like Texas, Indiana and Missouri to take some of their Democratic-held districts and alter them to favor Republicans instead.",
      "The developments in California Thursday come as Texas Republicans struggle to pass the maps that have become a national issue. Breakaway state House Democrats fled Texas earlier this month, denying the chamber the quorum it needed to take action on the new maps during a special legislative session.",
      "Since then, national Democrats have sought to call attention to what Republicans are trying to do in Texas, even as it's opened the left up to accusations of hypocrisy. During the standoff, some Texas Democrats have spoken out from Illinois, a blue state that was criticized for drawing its congressional maps after the 2020 Census to give Democrats the advantage.",
      "For both sides, the issue of congressional districts has become even more starkly partisan this summer. Various attempts have also been made in court to bring state House Democrats back to Texas, or to create a path that will help Republicans get their way.",
      "During a floor speech \u2014 before the maps passed the Texas Senate earlier this week in what amounted to a moot effort, given the House's obstacles \u2014 Republican Phil King bluntly said an objective of his \"was to support a plan that, simply put, elects more Republicans to the U.S. Congress.\"",
      "With the special session in Texas set to end in just a few days, Republicans have been adamant about eventually passing the maps, even if it takes more time and special sessions. With Democratic power limited in the state, there is a sense that Republicans will eventually be able to get their way.",
      "But the situation has left an opening for Newsom, a potential 2028 presidential candidate, to create a new front in the political fight, given that Democrats may have a path to redrawing Republican-held congressional districts in the blue state of California.",
      "A challenging process in California",
      "But California's effort will likely prove to be far more difficult and time intensive than the Republican-led push in Texas.",
      "In California, only nine of the state's 52 U.S. House districts are held by Republicans. Earlier this century, voters in the state signed off on putting in the state's constitution an independent citizens redistricting commission to decide new boundaries following the once a decade census process.",
      "The state-level differences between Democrat-led California and Republican-led Texas essentially make it harder for California Democrats to redraw districts in their state than it currently is for Texas Republicans. In Texas, GOP leaders and Mr. Trump allies just need to go through the normal legislative process to change districts.",
      "Because of California's constitution, changing the redistricting process in the state ahead of the 2026 midterms would likely require a new amendment. To take effect, it would need to be passed by a two-thirds vote in both the Assembly and Senate, and then be approved by California voters in an election. That election could prove costly, with major implications for the country on the line.",
      "Newsom said the difference between what's happening in California and Texas is \"we're working through a very transparent, temporary and public process.\"",
      "\"We're putting the maps on the ballot, and we're giving the power to the people,\" he said, adding that California would affirm its commitment to the state independent redistricting after the 2030 census.",
      "California lawmakers are scheduled to return to Sacramento on Aug. 18 amid the redistricting talk. The Legislature will have five days to conduct public hearings and formalize the process.",

      "In her ruling, U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher in Maryland found that the Education Department violated the law when it threatened to cut federal funding from educational institutions that continued with DEI initiatives.",
      "The guidance has been on hold since April when three federal judges blocked various portions of the Education Department's anti-DEI measures.",
      "The ruling Thursday followed a motion for summary judgment from the American Federation of Teachers and the American Sociological Association, which challenged the government's actions in a February lawsuit.",
      "The case centers on two Education Department memos ordering schools and universities to end all \"race-based decision-making\" or face penalties up to a total loss of federal funding. It's part of a campaign to end practices the Trump administration frames as discrimination against white and Asian American students.",
      "The new ruling orders the department to scrap the guidance because it runs afoul of procedural requirements, though Gallagher wrote that she took no view on whether the policies were \"good or bad, prudent or foolish, fair or unfair.\"",
      "Gallagher, who was appointed by President Trump, rejected the government's argument that the memos simply served to remind schools that discrimination is illegal.",
      "\"It initiated a sea change in how the Department of Education regulates educational practices and classroom conduct, causing millions of educators to reasonably fear that their lawful, and even beneficial, speech might cause them or their schools to be punished,\" Gallagher wrote.",

      "\"Threatening teachers and sowing chaos in schools throughout America is part of the administration's war on education, and today the people won,\" said Skye Perryman, the group's president and CEO.",
      "The Education Department did not immediately comment on Thursday.",
      "The conflict started with a Feb. 14 memo declaring that any consideration of race in admissions, financial aid, hiring or other aspects of academic and student life would be considered a violation of federal civil rights law.",
      "The memo dramatically expanded the government's interpretation of a 2023 Supreme Court decision barring colleges from considering race in admissions decisions. The government argued the ruling applied not only to admissions but across all of education, forbidding \"race-based preferences\" of any kind.",
      "\"Educational institutions have toxically indoctrinated students with the false premise that the United States is built upon 'systemic and structural racism' and advanced discriminatory policies and practices,\" wrote Craig Trainor, the acting assistant secretary of the department's Office for Civil Rights.",
      "A further memo in April asked state education agencies to certify they were not using \"illegal DEI practices.\" Violators risked losing federal money and being prosecuted under the False Claims Act, it said.",
      "In total, the guidance amounted to a full-scale reframing of the government's approach to civil rights in education. It took aim at policies that were created to address longstanding racial disparities, saying those practices were their own form of discrimination.",
      "The memos drew a wave of backlash from states and education groups that called it illegal government censorship.",
      "In its lawsuit, the American Federation of Teachers said the government was imposing \"unclear and highly subjective\" limits on schools across the country. It said teachers and professors had to \"choose between chilling their constitutionally protected speech and association or risk losing federal funds and being subject to prosecution.\"",

      "When CBS News reached out to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in the days before graduation this year to ask whether Wang \u2014 who was symbolically accepted into the class \u2014 would be awarded his diploma posthumously, the inquiry appeared to catch both the academy's media relations staff and leadership off guard. Yet among some class members, Wang's story of sacrifice remained vivid, and their determination to see him honored had not faded.",
      "\"When we put out a form asking for classmates to nominate honorary members of our class, I was not expecting Peter Wang's name to be on the list of nominees,\" newly minted Army 2nd Lt. Katherine Metz, the president of the class of 2025 at West Point, told CBS News. \"Most cadets nominated former classmates who were separated from West Point for reasons outside of their control \u2014 mostly medical \u2014 or foreign exchange cadets who made a significant impact on our class or their countries. However, Peter's name appeared countless times within our class's responses.\"",
      "Metz had read the article by CBS News and other news stories from the time of the shooting. She said a number of cadets from the class nominated Wang for the Honorary Graduate Award and would soon be mailing his certificate to his parents.",
      "The award is an honor conferred on those who did not physically graduate with the class but who embody West Point's core values of duty, honor and country.",
      "When the sounds of gunfire reverberated through the hallways of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Wang was in study hall. As panic spread, he moved toward the exit \u2014 not to flee, but to hold the door open, easing the way for his classmates to escape.",
      "He was shot 13 times. Wang was found dead in a third-floor hallway, wearing his Army JROTC uniform.",
      "The Florida National Guard honored Wang with a military funeral, and hundreds assembled to pay their respects.",
      "Metz said one of her classmates wrote about how Wang \"valiantly sacrificed himself to hold the door for his fellow classmates to escape,\" and said it was only fitting \"that we recognize him as an honorary graduate, as he would have been with us.\"",
      "Some members of the class of 2025 were already familiar with Wang's story and the tragic path that led to his posthumous admission. But for many, the details emerged only when his name was announced as an honorary member of the graduating class. From that moment, classmates say, his story became part of the class's shared identity \u2014 an enduring example of selflessness and sacrifice.",
      "\"Now, our whole class knows his story and will take his selfless example of sacrifice with us into our service as commissioned officers in the United States Army,\" said Metz.",
      "For his actions in 2018, Wang was posthumously awarded the Medal of Heroism by the U.S. Army, the highest award given to Army JROTC and ROTC cadets whose performance \"involved the acceptance of danger and extraordinary responsibilities.\" Junior ROTC cadets Alaina Petty and Martin Duque, who were also killed during the shooting, also received the medal.",
      "\"Peter demonstrated the characteristics and attributes we seek out of graduates of the Naval Academy or West Point,\" retired Lt. Gen. Robert Caslen told CBS News in May. Caslen, who was the superintendent of West Point in 2018, authorized Wang's entry into the class of 2025.",
      "He added, \"Individuals like Peter are exactly the men and women you want leading America's youth in combat situations, the fact that he demonstrated that at his age says a lot about him which is why we made him an honorary member of the class.\"",

    "summary": "Democrat Abigail Spanberger is trying to win over Latino voters in her bid to be the next governor of Virginia.",
    "story": [
      "Democrat Abigail Spanberger is working to make inroads with Latino voters ahead of the 2025 Virginia gubernatorial election, releasing her first Spanish-language radio ad on Thursday.",
      "The former congresswoman addresses rising costs, telling voters in Spanish, \"I know what it's like for families today. I got things done to lower costs. That's what I'll do as governor, too.\"",
      "Democrats across the country are working to regain the Latino support the party lost in the 2024 elections. President Trump made inroads with Latino voters both nationally and in key battleground states in the last election, outpacing Vice President Kamala Harris among Latino men. CBS News exit polling found the economy was the top issue for these voters, and most said they were worse off financially than they were four years earlier.",
      "But polling since Mr. Trump's inauguration suggests that support among Latinos is now slipping. Unidos US polling of Latino voters on the first 100 days of Mr. Trump's second term suggests that only 19% felt the economy is better, compared to 2024. Looking ahead to 2026, 29% of Latino voters believe the economic policies being implemented will make their own personal finances better. The economy ranks as their No. 1 priority. Sixty percent said Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans are not focusing enough on bringing down the cost of everyday goods.",
      "A spokesperson for Spanberger's campaign said she's \"meeting Latino Virginians where they are \u2014 on the ground and in-language \u2014 and will continue connecting with and listening to Virginians in every community to emphasize her focus on lowering costs for families, keeping communities safe, and preparing the next generation of Virginians for success.\"",
      "Latinos make up almost 11% of Virginia's total population, according to the Census Bureau, and their numbers are expected to continue to rise. Democratic strategist Chuck Rocha thinks Spanberger's focus on Latino voters is strategically smart.",
      "\"We saw in the last few cycles the Latino vote nationally has moved 18 points more Republican,\" Rocha said. \"She's starting early to build a narrative about what she's going to do to make people's lives better, and this affordability issue is the best place to be with Latinos right now.\"",
      "Spanberger has promised to work to lower the costs of health care and prescription drugs, housing and energy, as governor.",
      "Her ad also takes aim at her opponent, GOP Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, for supporting Trump administration policy proposals like shutting down the Department of Education.",
      "\"Sears backs Trump's cuts to education and health care, too,\" the ad says. \"We need a governor who fights for Virginia, not Trump.\"",
      "Earle-Sears is campaigning on her work alongside Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin and promising to continue his agenda if she's elected. On Thursday, her campaign announced a six-figure ad buy that highlights her record and labels Spanberger, who represented Virginia in Congress for six years, as a \"Washington insider.\"",
      "She criticizes Spanberger in a TV ad, saying that the former congresswoman \"voted with Pelosi and Biden every single time.\"",
      "\"That kind of Beltway nonsense will only take us backwards,\" Earle-Sears says in the ad. \"Governor Youngkin put us on the right path. Now I'm asking for your vote to keep it that way.\"",
      "Virginia's race for governor is often viewed as a referendum on the administration, since it occurs a year after the presidential election. In an interview with CBS News in June, Spanberger said Virginians like the fact that they're one of two states that will elect a new governor in 2025: \"This November, Virginia gets to be the first to the polls, along with our friends up in New Jersey, to be able to make clear what it is that we want in our state leadership.\""

    "summary": "The trial over President Trump's deployment of thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles earlier this summer reached its third and final day Wednesday.",
    "story": [
      "The trial over President Trump's deployment of thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles earlier this summer reached its third and final day Wednesday, as lawyers for the Justice Department and the state of California argued over the validity of Gov. Gavin Newsom's lawsuit and whether the Posse Comitatus Act \u2014 which generally bars the military from engaging in domestic law enforcement \u2014 applied to the troop deployment.",
      "Mr. Trump in June deployed 4,000 California National Guard troops and 700 Marines to Los Angeles, saying they were needed to protect federal property and law enforcement agents amid June protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations. Newsom did not approve of the use of his state's Guard forces and responded with a lawsuit\u00a0requesting an injunction limiting the military's role in the city.",
      "In addition to claiming the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act does not apply, Eric Hamilton, a lawyer for the Department of Justice, argued that there is no precedent for the lawsuit, for injunctive relief or money damages under the act, and that Newsom and the state of California have not suffered the harm required to sue.",
      "\"It is, in fact, the federal government who is engaged in unprecedented conduct,\" said Deputy Attorney General Meghan Strong, representing the State of California, explaining that the government has never used the military in this way before.",
      "U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer seemed perplexed by several of the government's assertions, particularly what he called the apparent \"absence of any limits to a national police force.\" He questioned the Justice Department's claim that the 19th century law at the center of this trial is not relevant, and the assertion that his court lacks jurisdiction to issue an injunction against the president.",
      "\"So then what is the remedy?\" Breyer asked Hamilton, raising the issue of presidential immunity from criminal prosecution. \"You're saying there's a criminal remedy? The president can be prosecuted? You say that in light of the Supreme Court decision, the Trump decision. Isn't he immune?\"",
      "\"So that's it. Too bad. So sad. It's over,\" he added emphatically. \"And that's the end of the case.\"",
      "California has asked Breyer for an injunction that would allow the military to protect federal property \u2014 such as courthouses and ICE facilities \u2014 but block it from continuing the support for immigration enforcement operations, which the state's lawyer called an \"unlawful military crusade.\"",
      "\"The constitution and the law and the facts are on Governor Newsom's side,\" said Josh Kastenberg, a professor at the University of New Mexico Law School. \"But that doesn't mean he's going to win. Ever since World War II, the courts have embraced this military deference doctrine, which really is presidential deference in matters of military command and control.\"",
      "Questions over scope",
      "\"We're going to see federal officers everywhere if the president determines that there's some threat to the safety of a federal agent,\" Breyer said to Hamilton. \"And it's his determination. Not mine, it's his. That's what you're saying. That's what the law is.\"",
      "Hamilton said that wasn't \"quite what I'm saying.\" He asserted the troops are not enforcing federal law, but providing protection, and that it is lawful for guardsmen and marines to provide protection for federal buildings \u2014 the one point he agreed with California's attorney on. But, he argued, there is no distinction between protecting federal property and protecting federal law enforcement working out in the field.",
      "Breyer pointed out that federal employees \"are everywhere.\"",
      "The judge further questioned why any National Guard members remain in Los Angeles, and expressed concern about the justification for continued operations. Hamilton testified that 300 guardsmen remain, a 90% reduction in the force. Strong countered that it is still a significant number of soldiers, and certainly enough to violate the law.",
      "\"Thank goodness for the National Guard, but why is the federalized National Guard still in place?\" asked Breyer. \"What's the threat today? What was the threat yesterday?\"",
      "\"I go back to the thing that I'm really troubled by: What limiting factors are there to the use of this force?\" he said, \"Once you have a force in place, and maybe legitimately do so, and the threat that gave rise to the force in that place subsides \u2026 how does one look at this national police force that goes out of where the threat was and starts executing other laws?\"",
      "Does the Posse Comitatus Act apply?",
      "Breyer appeared to take issue with the Justice Department's argument that the Posse Comitatus Act does not apply, noting that a key witness, Major General Scott Sherman \u2014 who was at one point the commanding general of the Guard task force in Los Angeles \u2014 had testified that the troops were trained to act within the bounds of that law.",
      "\"Then why is it the excellent Major General sought assurance that the Posse Comitatus Act was followed?\" said Breyer. \"Why did I spend a day looking at slide after slide, and regulation after regulation, and reports after reports on conduct of the soldiers to ensure that they were in compliance with the Posse Comitatus Act if the Posse Comitatus Act is irrelevant?\"",
      "Strong argued that all of the Department of Defense's leaders agreed that the Posse Comitatus Act applied to the Task Force 51 troops in Los Angeles. She said they substituted the word \"protection\" for \"security\" when describing the troops' activities because they knew that \"security\" would violate the act.",
      "She asserted that the secretary of defense had released a memorandum invoking a constitutional exception to the Posse Comitatus Act, and affirmatively instructing soldiers to engage in activities that violated it \u2014 but the memo was issued after those activities had taken place.",
      "On Tuesday, Sherman testified that he was advised of a \"constitutional exception\" that enabled the troops to conduct certain activities that would normally violate the Posse Comitatus Act.",
      "Strong called this an attempt by the Department of Defense to justify their actions after the fact that \"itself reveals a knowledge and awareness of their violations.\"",
      "The federal government is \"disregarding the law, and so we need show nothing more than that,\" said Strong.",
      "She further argued that the Constitution seeks to make sure the president cannot control a standing army the way the king had in 1776. She said that it would deny the basic principles of federalism for the state to have \"no legal recourse to challenge the conduct of these troops.\"",
      "\"If you look at the plain language of the Posse Comitatus Act, and the fear of standing armies that existed at the time of the Constitution,\" Kastenberg said. \"... One of the biggest issues in the state conventions and in the framing of the Constitution to begin with was to significantly curtail the president's authority over the standing army, and keep the standing army very small.\"",
      "Breyer did not give a timeline for his ruling, stating at the end of the day, \"I will decide the case as soon as I can decide the case.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Wednesday that the White House will seek \"long-term extensions\" from Congress to maintain control of D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department, part of the president's push to crack down on crime in the nation's capital.",
      "\"I think the Republicans in Congress will approve this pretty much unanimously,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the deployment of members of the National Guard to D.C. on Monday and said the federal government would also take control of the D.C. police. In an executive order Monday, the president directed the D.C. mayor to provide the services of the Metropolitan Police Department for federal use \"for the maximum period permitted under section 740 of the Home Rule Act.\"",
      "The 1973 law allows the president to require the D.C. mayor to provide \"such services of the Metropolitan Police force as the President may deem necessary and appropriate\" for a period of 48 hours, a deadline that can be extended by up to 30 days by notifying Congress, which the president has done. Any extension beyond 30 days requires a joint resolution passed by the House and Senate.",
      "Speaking at the Kennedy Center, Mr. Trump said he expects Congress to extend the federal takeover, saying, \"We think the Republicans will do it almost unanimously.\"",
      "\"We're going to need a crime bill that we're going to be putting in and it's going to pertain initially to D.C.,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We're going to be asking for extensions on that, long-term extensions, because you can't have 30 days.\"",
      "Although Republicans have majorities in both the House and Senate, the extension would require the support of at least seven Democrats to advance, since most legislation functions under a 60-vote threshold in the upper chamber, where Republicans control 53 seats.",
      "The president said he could extend the takeover without Congress' help \"if it's a national emergency,\" but he said, \"I don't want to call a national emergency.\"",
      "\"If I have to, I will,\" Mr. Trump added. \"But I think the Republicans in Congress will approve this pretty much unanimously.\"",

Robberies have dropped by 28% this year and overall violent crime is down 26%, as of Aug. 11.

In all, production of more than 15 models of front load washers will shift to the company's Louisville complex \u2014 known as Appliance Park, it said.",
      "Once its new plan is fully implemented, GE Appliances will have invested $6.5 billion across its 11 U.S. manufacturing plants and nationwide distribution network since 2016, it said.",

      "\"It was, in essence, the start of a cure for pancreatic cancer, where half of the patients in that study were surviving,\" Coller said.",
      "The early results encouraged scientists, but the small sample size called for further studies, which led to a\u00a0Phase 2 trial published in Nature earlier this year.",
      "Experimental mRNA-focused treatments have also showed promise in fighting lung,\u00a0colorectal and gastric cancers. For example, a study published online in the journal Gastric Cancer\u00a0found a mRNA-based vaccine led to robust gastric tumor regression in mice.",
      "And earlier this year, the world was was awed by news that an infant named KJ Muldoon became the first patient to undergo personalized gene-editing treatment using a technique known as CRISPR to fix a rare and potentially fatal genetic disorder.",
      "As Coller pointed out, the CRISPR technology had to be delivered via mRNA.",
      "\"This opens a floodgate for rare diseases,\" he said. \"We're now talking about, could we use the same technology to go after all rare diseases?\"",
      "Autoimmune diseases are another area of research, for treating things like multiple sclerosis, Type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease.",
      "While all of these are still at the early research stage, Coller urged the importance of investing in this technology now for future progress.",
      "\"We need to do experiments and see where we can get with the next generation of mRNA-based drugs,\" he said.",
      "Like with COVID-19, there has also been continued research on mRNA-based vaccines for infectious diseases like the flu, RSV, Zika virus and cytomegalovirus, known as CMV, an infection that can be harmful to babies exposed during the mother's pregnancy.",
      "\"We're at a point where, if we continue to develop this technology, we'll get more personalized, bespoke medicine that we can use on patients and improve health care outcomes,\" Coller said.",
      "How is mRNA medicine so versatile?",
      "RNA stands for ribonucleic acid, an essential molecule in the body's cells. It is similar to DNA but has different functions. Messenger RNA, or mRNA, carries the information required for making proteins.",
      "As Coller put it: \"If your DNA is a cookbook, your mRNA is an individual recipe that's telling your body what to do.\"",
      "To harness that power for treating disease, \"All we're doing with this technology is giving it new recipes. We're taking advantage of this powerful natural system that exists in your body,\" he said.",
      "The versatility and potential to help such a range of illnesses is what has experts like Coller \u2014 who was not immediately impacted by the funding cuts \u2014 hoping the administration will reinstate funding for mRNA research.",
      "\"We have to keep moving forward,\" he said. \"People wanting to improve their family's lives and their children's lives is a bipartisan issue, it's truly an American issue. So we've got to keep moving.\"",

      "\"In 2025, the waning gibbous moon will severely compromise this shower at the time of maximum activity,\" the organization says. \"Such conditions will reduce activity by at least 75 percent as only the brighter meteors will be visible.\"",
      "Viewers this year can expect to see between 10-20 Perseids each hour, as opposed to 50 Perseids per hour under darker conditions, it says.",
      "\"The strength of each Perseid display varies year to year, mainly due to lunar conditions,\"\u00a0writes Robert Lunsford with the American Meteor Society. \"If a bright moon is above the horizon during the night of maximum activity, then the display will be reduced. Most of the Perseid meteors are faint and bright moonlight will make it difficult to view.\"",
      "The Perseids meteor shower has been ongoing for several weeks. It started in mid-July and will continue until Aug. 23.",

    "summary": "ULA's Vulcan is replacing the company's workhorse Atlas 5 rocket and the already-retired Delta 4 family of launchers.",
    "story": [
      "United Launch Alliance fired off its first operational Vulcan rocket Tuesday, boosting two military satellites into space in the first U.S. Space Force-sanctioned flight of a new launcher that eventually will replace the company's Atlas 5 and already-retired Deltas.",
      "Equipped with four solid-fuel strap-on boosters for additional takeoff power, the 198-foot-tall Vulcan's two methane-fueled BE-4 engines thundered to life at 8:56 p.m. EDT, instantly propelling the rocket away from pad 41 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.",
      "Arcing over the Atlantic Ocean on an easterly trajectory, the Vulcan put on a spectacular sky-lighting show as it roared aloft atop nearly 3 million pounds of thrust and a jet of brilliant exhaust visible for miles around.",
      "The four strap-on boosters were jettisoned about 90 seconds after liftoff, followed three-and-a-half minutes later by burnout and separation of the Vulcan's 109-foot-tall first stage.",
      "The Centaur second stage's two hydrogen-fueled Aerojet Rocketdyne RL10C engines ignited and took over from there, but in keeping with standard policy for military missions, ULA ended its launch commentary at that point and the rest of the flight was carried out in secrecy.",
      "At least two satellites were believed to be on board: one fully classified spacecraft and an experimental satellite that will carry out tests of upgraded atomic clocks and navigation technology that could lead to more accurate, jam-proof Global Positioning System-type data for military and commercial users.",
      "Both satellites were bound for geosynchronous orbit 22,300 miles above the equator, where spacecraft take 24 hours to complete one orbit, thus appearing stationary in the sky.",
      "GPS satellites operate in 12,500-mile-high orbits, but Navigation Technology Satellite 3, or NTS-3, will operate from its much higher perch using an advanced phased array antenna that can electronically direct signals to receivers in multiple locations across broad regions.",
      "It is the Pentagon's first experimental navigation satellite since GPS precursors were launched in the 1970s. Along with the NTS-3 satellite, designed and built by L3Harris Technologies, the program includes a ground-based control system and receivers linked by software that enable rapid reprogramming as needed for upgrades or to utilize different signals.",
      "\"GPS is such an integral part of our lives today,\" said Joanna Hinks, a senior aerospace engineer with the Air Force Research Laboratory at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. \"You probably all use it in ways that you didn't even realize throughout your morning.",
      "\"And with NTS-3, we are going to be experimenting with a number of different technologies that look at how we can continue to evolve and augment GPS to make sure that it remains the gold standard that our warfighters need.\"",
      "While the major goal of the flight is launching the USSF-106 payloads, the launch marked a major milestone for United Launch Alliance.",
      "It was the third launch of the powerful new Vulcan after two test flights last year and the first to be \"certified\" by the Space Force to carry costly national security spy satellites and other expensive military spacecraft.",
      "\"This mission is headed directly to geosynchronous orbit and will be one of our longest missions to date,\" said Gary Wentz, ULA vice president of government and commercial programs. \"This is the sole purpose of this vehicle. It was purposely designed to support these missions doing direct inject to geo for the Space Force.\"",
      "The Vulcan is replacing ULA's already-retired Delta family of rockets and the venerable Atlas 5, which is powered by a Russian-built RD-180 first stage engine. Criticism of ULA's use of Russian engines for launches of American military satellites and NASA spacecraft helped fuel congressional pressure for a new all-American launcher.",
      "Thirteen Atlas 5's are left in ULA's inventory, all of them slated for civilian launches as ULA, a partnership of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, transitions to an all-Vulcan fleet.",
      "In the meantime, SpaceX dominates the world launch market with its partially reusable and highly successful kerosene-fueled Falcon 9 and triple-core Falcon Heavy rockets. So far this year, SpaceX has launched 97 Falcon 9s.",
      "But ULA President and CEO Tory Bruno said the Vulcan's first stage, using high-performance BE-4 engines provided by Blue Origin \u2014 owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos \u2014 and its high-power Centaur upper stage make the rocket particularly well suited for launching heavy military payloads into hard-to-reach orbits.",
      "\"It is specifically designed for these exotic orbits that are primarily for the government,\" he said. \"And this particular mission is the quintessential example. It is a direct injection to geosynchronous orbit. That means that it is a very, very long-duration mission.\"",
      "He said the first stage is, in effect, delivering the Centaur to space with a full load of propellant \"to go from LEO (low-Earth orbit) to somewhere else, like all the way to the geo belt, which is 20 times higher up. And what that translates to in capability (is) certainly more mass and more accuracy than is easily done by others.\"",
      "While he didn't mention SpaceX or its Falcon Heavy by name, or ULA's retired Delta 4 Heavy, Bruno said \"if you're a typical three-core heavy launch vehicle and ... really derived from a vehicle optimized for that LEO mission, you're going to have to have three cores to get out there, and you're going to have to expend all of them.",
      "\"And here's the really complicated rocket science. You know, one core is cheaper and more efficient than three expendable cores. It's literally that simple.\"",
      "That, coupled with the high-energy Centaur upper stage, gives ULA the capability to launch heavy payloads directly to high orbits without requiring satellites to use their own thrusters \u2014 and limited propellant \u2014 in transit.",
      "ULA is expanding its ground infrastructure and expects to launch nine flights in 2025, reaching a cadence of two per month by the end of the year. The company expects to launch between 20 and 25 flights in 2026.",

    "summary": "ULA's Vulcan is replacing the company's workhorse Atlas 5 rocket and the already-retired Delta 4 family of launchers.",
    "story": [
      "United Launch Alliance fired off its first operational Vulcan rocket Tuesday, boosting two military satellites into space in the first U.S. Space Force-sanctioned flight of a new launcher that eventually will replace the company's Atlas 5 and already-retired Deltas.",
      "Equipped with four solid-fuel strap-on boosters for additional takeoff power, the 198-foot-tall Vulcan's two methane-fueled BE-4 engines thundered to life at 8:56 p.m. EDT, instantly propelling the rocket away from pad 41 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.",
      "Arcing over the Atlantic Ocean on an easterly trajectory, the Vulcan put on a spectacular sky-lighting show as it roared aloft atop nearly 3 million pounds of thrust and a jet of brilliant exhaust visible for miles around.",
      "The four strap-on boosters were jettisoned about 90 seconds after liftoff, followed three-and-a-half minutes later by burnout and separation of the Vulcan's 109-foot-tall first stage.",
      "The Centaur second stage's two hydrogen-fueled Aerojet Rocketdyne RL10C engines ignited and took over from there, but in keeping with standard policy for military missions, ULA ended its launch commentary at that point and the rest of the flight was carried out in secrecy.",
      "At least two satellites were believed to be on board: one fully classified spacecraft and an experimental satellite that will carry out tests of upgraded atomic clocks and navigation technology that could lead to more accurate, jam-proof Global Positioning System-type data for military and commercial users.",
      "Both satellites were bound for geosynchronous orbit 22,300 miles above the equator, where spacecraft take 24 hours to complete one orbit, thus appearing stationary in the sky.",
      "GPS satellites operate in 12,500-mile-high orbits, but Navigation Technology Satellite 3, or NTS-3, will operate from its much higher perch using an advanced phased array antenna that can electronically direct signals to receivers in multiple locations across broad regions.",
      "It is the Pentagon's first experimental navigation satellite since GPS precursors were launched in the 1970s. Along with the NTS-3 satellite, designed and built by L3Harris Technologies, the program includes a ground-based control system and receivers linked by software that enable rapid reprogramming as needed for upgrades or to utilize different signals.",
      "\"GPS is such an integral part of our lives today,\" said Joanna Hinks, a senior aerospace engineer with the Air Force Research Laboratory at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. \"You probably all use it in ways that you didn't even realize throughout your morning.",
      "\"And with NTS-3, we are going to be experimenting with a number of different technologies that look at how we can continue to evolve and augment GPS to make sure that it remains the gold standard that our warfighters need.\"",
      "While the major goal of the flight is launching the USSF-106 payloads, the launch marked a major milestone for United Launch Alliance.",
      "It was the third launch of the powerful new Vulcan after two test flights last year and the first to be \"certified\" by the Space Force to carry costly national security spy satellites and other expensive military spacecraft.",
      "\"This mission is headed directly to geosynchronous orbit and will be one of our longest missions to date,\" said Gary Wentz, ULA vice president of government and commercial programs. \"This is the sole purpose of this vehicle. It was purposely designed to support these missions doing direct inject to geo for the Space Force.\"",
      "The Vulcan is replacing ULA's already-retired Delta family of rockets and the venerable Atlas 5, which is powered by a Russian-built RD-180 first stage engine. Criticism of ULA's use of Russian engines for launches of American military satellites and NASA spacecraft helped fuel congressional pressure for a new all-American launcher.",
      "Thirteen Atlas 5's are left in ULA's inventory, all of them slated for civilian launches as ULA, a partnership of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, transitions to an all-Vulcan fleet.",
      "In the meantime, SpaceX dominates the world launch market with its partially reusable and highly successful kerosene-fueled Falcon 9 and triple-core Falcon Heavy rockets. So far this year, SpaceX has launched 97 Falcon 9s.",
      "But ULA President and CEO Tory Bruno said the Vulcan's first stage, using high-performance BE-4 engines provided by Blue Origin \u2014 owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos \u2014 and its high-power Centaur upper stage make the rocket particularly well suited for launching heavy military payloads into hard-to-reach orbits.",
      "\"It is specifically designed for these exotic orbits that are primarily for the government,\" he said. \"And this particular mission is the quintessential example. It is a direct injection to geosynchronous orbit. That means that it is a very, very long-duration mission.\"",
      "He said the first stage is, in effect, delivering the Centaur to space with a full load of propellant \"to go from LEO (low-Earth orbit) to somewhere else, like all the way to the geo belt, which is 20 times higher up. And what that translates to in capability (is) certainly more mass and more accuracy than is easily done by others.\"",
      "While he didn't mention SpaceX or its Falcon Heavy by name, or ULA's retired Delta 4 Heavy, Bruno said \"if you're a typical three-core heavy launch vehicle and ... really derived from a vehicle optimized for that LEO mission, you're going to have to have three cores to get out there, and you're going to have to expend all of them.",
      "\"And here's the really complicated rocket science. You know, one core is cheaper and more efficient than three expendable cores. It's literally that simple.\"",
      "That, coupled with the high-energy Centaur upper stage, gives ULA the capability to launch heavy payloads directly to high orbits without requiring satellites to use their own thrusters \u2014 and limited propellant \u2014 in transit.",
      "ULA is expanding its ground infrastructure and expects to launch nine flights in 2025, reaching a cadence of two per month by the end of the year. The company expects to launch between 20 and 25 flights in 2026.",

A so-called going concern warning is an accounting term that signals a risk that a business might cease operations.",
      "Shares of Kodak plunged $1.73, or 26%, to $5.05 in Tuesday morning trading. Reached for comment, a Kodak spokesperson pointed to the statement in its regulatory filing.",
      "The warning is the latest development in the photography company's storied history, which includes introducing one of the first consumer cameras in the 1880s and mass manufacturing film rolls for hobbyists and professionals alike. But Kodak struggled to adapt when digital cameras overtook film starting in the 1990s, leading to a bankruptcy filing in 2012.",
      "Its current financial crunch is tied to almost $500 million in short-term debt obligations, as well as more than $200 million in pension liabilities. Last year, Kodak had said it would end its pension plan in order to reduce debt, according to the Wall Street Journal.",

      "Rochester, New York-based Eastman Kodak, founded by inventor George Eastman in 1892, mass produced the famed Brownie and Instamatic cameras, popularizing photography as a pastime for generations of Americans. Its yellow-and-red film boxes were ubiquitous in photo shops and other retailers.",
      "Eastman said his goal was \"to make the camera as convenient as the pencil,\" according to the Kodak website.",
      "But Kodak faced competition from Japanese companies, including Fujifilm in the 1990s, as well as the shift to digital technology, leading to its filing for\u00a0bankruptcy protection in 2012.",
      "The company wound up selling off many of its businesses and patents, while shutting down the camera manufacturing unit that first made it famous. It received approval for its plan to emerge from court oversight a year later.",
      "At the time, Kodak was looking to recreate itself as a new, much smaller company focused on commercial and packaging printing.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. chipmakers Nvidia and AMD will pay the U.S. government 15% of revenue generated by sales of their AI chips in China, a White House official confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The Financial Times on Sunday\u00a0reported that the agreement between the tech giants and the U.S. government was reached as a condition for granting export licenses for China, which were provided last week. A U.S. official confirmed the \"broad strokes\" of the report to CBS News.",
      "The arrangement, with companies providing a stream of revenue in exchange for export licenses, is highly unusual as corporations typically do not pay the federal government a share of revenue from their export sales. Export licenses also do not carry any fees,\u00a0according to shipping giant Maersk.",
      "In a Monday press conference, President Trump described the agreement with Nvidia as a deal that would benefit the nation. He described meeting with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to discuss the terms of agreeing to the export license; Mr. Trump didn't mention AMD in his comments.",
      "\"So I said, 'I want 20% if I'm going to approve it for you,'\" Mr. Trump said of his meeting with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to discuss the terms of the export license. \"I don't want it myself, so when I say I want 20%, it's for the country.\"",
      "\"[Huang] said, 'Will you make it 15%?' so we negotiated a little deal,\" the president added.",
      "The revenue-sharing plan comes after the White House\u00a0announced\u00a0in April that it would restrict sales of Nvidia's H20 chips and MI308 chips from rival chipmaker AMD to China. However, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang last month said it had won approval from the Trump administration to sell its H20 chips to China.",
      "The H20 chip, which is specialized for artificial intelligence applications, was developed by Nvidia for the Chinese market, while AMD's MI308 chips are also geared for AI.",
      "It is unclear how the Trump administration would use the money generated from the chip sales agreement.",
      "Nvidia declined to comment on the specifics of the deal. In a statement, a spokesperson said, \"We follow rules the U.S. government sets for our participation in worldwide markets. While we haven't shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide.\"",

      "The midsize electric truck could be produced up to 40% faster than other vehicles at the Louisville Assembly Plant due to the new process, Ford said.",
      "In another effort to lower costs, the auto company is also reducing the number of components that go into each car. Vehicles produced on the \"universal EV platform\" will have 20% fewer parts than a traditional vehicle, Ford said.",
      "The company will also use smaller cobalt and nickel-free batteries that will allow it to make \"cost gains,\" according to a video shared by Ford.",
      "Anderson said that Ford has its work cut out for them given that the new truck will need to be competitively priced and economical. According to the auto industry expert, the cost of charging EV trucks currently on the market is often much higher than the price at the pump for gas-powered versions. A report from the Anderson Economic Group shows pickup trucks drivers in New York, California and Michigan face \"significantly higher costs\" if they rely on an EV.",

      "The report is one of two reviews into Hardin's escape, which is also being investigated by the Arkansas State Police. A legislative subcommittee has also been holding hearings about the escape.",
      "Republican state Rep. Howard Beaty, who co-chairs the Legislative Council's Charitable, Penal and Correctional Institutions Subcommittee, said the panel hoped to discuss both reports with officials at a hearing next month.",
      "Republican state Sen. Ben Gilmore, who sits on the panel, said he didn't think the department's review took a thorough enough look at the systemic issues that enabled Hardin's escape.",
      "\"They have focused on the final failure instead of all of the things that led up to it,\" he said.",
      "The report also cites confusion among corrections officials in the early stages of Hardin's escape about which law enforcement agencies had been notified, the report says.",
      "\"It is obvious there was a lot of confusion during the beginning stages of opening the command center and of notifications being made,\" the report says.",
      "Hardin had been misclassified and shouldn't have been held at the primarily medium-security prison, according to the review. After he was captured, Hardin was moved to a maximum-security prison. He has pleaded not guilty to escape charges, and his trial is set for November.",
      "Hardin's custody classification hadn't been reviewed since October 2019, the report says.",
      "The state Department of Corrections' review says officials had taken several steps since Hardin's escape, including removing the electric locks from the gates to prevent someone from walking out without an officer present.",
      "The report also calls for additional cameras after finding a blind spot on the dock Hardin used, and for any \"shakedown\" searches for contraband to include mechanical rooms and side rooms.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/d-c-sues-trump-bondi-over-federal-takeover-of-d-c-police/",
    "published": "Fri, 15 Aug 2025 21:45:04 -0400",
    "summary": "Attorney General Pam Bondi issued an order Thursday that amounted to a reversal of \"sanctuary\" policies in D.C. The District sued over the order Friday.",
    "story": [
      "After a hearing in the D.C. U.S. District Court Friday, the Justice Department agreed to remove its newly named D.C. emergency police chief and to rewrite a directive ending District of Columbia rules limiting cooperation between its police and federal immigration authorities.",
      "The District of Columbia sued the Trump administration and Attorney General Pam Bondi earlier in the day. D.C. alleges her efforts to scuttle the District's \"sanctuary\" rules curbing local police cooperation with immigration authorities during the federal police takeover are illegal.",
      "Late Thursday night, Bondi named Terry Cole, the administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, emergency police chief in Washington, as part of her sweeping orders to increase federal control over the Metropolitan Police Department.",
      "U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes heard Friday's arguments in the case, which is centered around Section 740 of the Home Rule Act of 1973. That provision allows the president to require the D.C. mayor to provide \"such services of the Metropolitan Police force as the President may deem necessary and appropriate\" for up to 30 days. President Trump invoked Section 740 Monday,\u00a0 placing the D.C. MPD under direct federal control to crack down on crime in the district.",
      "\"I think these are the kinds of issues that should be decided between the district and the government,\" Reyes said. \"If I have to step in, I will.\"",
      "Now, D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith will continue leading the department, according to Yaakov Roth, principal deputy attorney general in the Justice Department. At the end of the hearing, Roth said the Justice Department would make Cole an intermediary between the White House and MPD during the Trump administration's takeover of the city's police. For now, the federal takeover is expected to last 30 days.",
      "Both sides agreed to continue the arguments over immigration policy next week, after the new policies are written.",
      "In a statement Friday evening following the hearing, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said she needed \"to defend our autonomy. We know that our access to democracy is different than anywhere else in America.\"",
      "\"This evening, I am pleased to be able to report that, after a day in court and in accordance with Home Rule, Pamela Smith remains our Chief of Police,\" she said.",
      "On Thursday night, Bondi, whose department is overseeing the 30-day federalization, announced an order terminating some of the \"sanctuary\" immigration policies in the nation's capital.",
      "Under her order, the MPD would temporarily fully cooperate with federal agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other immigration authorities.",
      "Bondi also rescinded guidance issued by D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith just this week that allowed police officers to transport ICE agents and their detainees and to share immigration information during traffic stops. Smith's directive had still barred most local involvement in federal immigration enforcement.",
      "Bondi also removed guidance that prohibited D.C. police officers from searching databases to determine a person's immigration status, even when there's no underlying criminal warrant.",
      "She also suspended District rules that barred local police from arresting individuals based on administrative immigration warrants signed by ICE officials \u2014 not judges \u2014 and from assisting federal agents during such arrests. The now-defunct policy had required officers to have a criminal nexus before carrying out an arrest and prohibited arrests solely based on suspected civil immigration law violations.",
      "Mitchell Reich, an attorney for the D.C. attorney general's office, asked Judge Reyes to block the Trump administration from taking full operational control of MPD and to block Bondi's orders revoking the D.C. police department's non-cooperation with ICE and other federal immigration agencies.",
      "Reyes said that the Home Rule Act does require Bowser to follow White House directives, but the administration cannot fully control every MPD move.",
      "\"The statute would have no meaning at all if the president could just say, 'we're taking over your police department,'\" Reyes said. \"The president can't say, 'Mayor, I'm asking for the services of your entire police department. I need them to be at my beck and call.'\"",
      "Reyes said while the Trump administration can make specific requests of the MPD to do something, it cannot tell MPD not to do something.",
      "\"If the president today called the mayor\u2026 and said, 'I need the services of the MPD to help ICE,' I don't think she could say no,\" Reyes said. \"The statute says the mayor shall, not the mayor can.\"",
      "The judge also expressed skepticism about Bondi's appointment of Cole. Reyes, appointed to the bench by Joe Biden, has at times criticized the Trump administration's actions in its cases before her.",
      "Roth argued that the language in the Home Rule Act is \"broad\" and allows for the White House\u00a0 takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department without judicial review.",
      "In D.C.'s complaint, D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb warned that the Trump administration's \"unlawful assertions of authority will create immediate, devastating, and irreparable harms for the District. Most critically, the order threatens to upend the command structure of MPD and wreak operational havoc within the department, endangering the safety of the public and law enforcement officers alike.\"",
      "While Mr. Trump has raised the possibility of expanding his administration's control of the city's law enforcement beyond the 30-day maximum without congressional approval, Roth said his interpretation of the law was that the federalization would end without intervention from Congress.",
      "\"That's why we want this to be successful,\" Roth said. \"We want this to work well.\"",
      "\"I totally agree that everyone wants this to be successful,\" Reyes replied. \"And my job as I see it is to make sure that it is successful and within constitutional bounds.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Aug 2025 20:40:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Both President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered brief remarks, but took no questions, in Alaska.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin left Alaska Friday without a ceasefire agreement, although both men described the meeting as constructive.",
      "In what was billed by the White House as a press conference following their meeting, Mr. Trump and Putin took no questions, ignoring shouted ones from reporters.",
      "Putin spoke little of Ukraine, focusing on the bond and heritage between the U.S. and Russia, while Mr. Trump said many points were agreed to, and a few are left, regarding Ukraine. The U.S. president plans to call European leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, he said.",
      "Here is a transcript of what Mr. Trump and Putin said:",
      "PUTIN: Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, our negotiations have been held in a constructive atmosphere of mutual respect.",
      "We have very thorough negotiations that were quite useful. I would like to thank once again my American counterpart, for the proposal to travel out here to Alaska. It only makes sense that we've met here, because our countries, though separated by the oceans, are close neighbors. So when we've met, when I came out of the plane and I said, 'Good afternoon, dear neighbor. Very good to see you in good health and to see you alive.' I think that is very neighborly. I think that's some kind words that we can say to each other. We're separated by the strait of Bering, though, there are two islands only between the Russian Island and the U.S. Island. They're only four kilometers apart. We are close neighbors, and it's a fact.",
      "It's also important that Alaska has to do with our common heritage, common history between Russia and the U.S., and many positive events have to do with that territory. Still, there is tremendous cultural heritage, back from the Russian America, for example, Orthodox churches, and a lot of- more than 700 geographical names of Russian origin. During the Second World War, it was here in Alaska that was the origin of the legendary air bridge for the supply of military aircraft and other equipment under the Lend-Lease Program.",
      "It was a dangerous and treacherous route over the vast emptiness of ice. However, the pilots of both countries did everything to bring closer the victory. They risked their lives and they gave it all for the common victory. I was just in the city of Magadan in Russia. And there is a memorial there dedicated to the Russian, the U.S. pilots. And there are two flags, the U.S. flag and the Russian flag. And I know that here as well, there is such a memorial. There is a military burial place several kilometers away from here. The Soviet pilots are buried there who died during that dangerous mission. We're thankful to the citizens and the government of the U.S. for carefully taking care of their memory. I think that's very worthy and noble. We'll always remember other historical examples when our countries defeated common enemies together in the spirit of battle camaraderie and allyship that supported each other and facilitated each other. I am sure that this heritage will help us rebuild and foster mutually beneficial and equal ties at this new stage, even during the hardest conditions.",
      "It is known that there have been no summits between Russia and the U.S. for four years, and that's a long time. This time was very hard for bilateral relations, and let's be frank, they've fallen to the lowest point since the Cold War. I think that's not benefiting our countries and the world as a whole. It is apparent that sooner or later, we have to amend the situation to move on from the confrontation to dialog, and in this case, a personal meeting between the heads of state has been long overdue, naturally, under the condition of serious and painstaking work, and this work has been done.",
      "In general, me and President Trump have very good direct contact. We've spoken multiple times. We spoke frankly on the phone. And the special envoy of the president, Mr. Witkoff, traveled out to Russia several times. Our advisers and heads of foreign ministries kept in touch all the time, and we know fully well that one of the central issues was the situation around Ukraine.",
      "We see the strive of the administration and President Trump personally to help facilitate the resolution of the Ukrainian conflict, and his strive to get to the crux of the matter, to understand this history, is precious. As I've said, the situation in Ukraine has to do with fundamental threats to our security. Moreover, we've always considered the Ukrainian nation, and I've said it multiple times, a brotherly nation. How strange it may sound in these conditions. We have the same roots, and everything that's happening is a tragedy for us, and terrible wound. Therefore, the country is sincerely interested in putting an end to it.",
      "At the same time, we're convinced that in order to, to make the settlement lasting and long term, we need to eliminate all the primary roots, the primary causes of that conflict, and we've said it multiple times, to consider all legitimate concerns of Russia and to reinstate a just balance of security in Europe and in the world on the whole, and agree with President Trump, as he has said today, that naturally, the security of Ukraine should be ensured as well. Naturally, we are prepared to work on that.",
      "I would like to hope that the agreement that we've reached together will help us bring closer that goal and will pave the path towards peace in Ukraine. We expect that Kyiv and European capitals will perceive that constructively and that they won't throw a wrench in the works. They will not make any attempts to use some backroom dealings to conduct provocations to torpedo the nascent progress.",
      "Incidentally, when the new administration came to power, bilateral trade started to grow. It's still very symbolic. Still, we have a growth of 20%. As I've said, we have a lot of dimensions for joint work. It is clear that the U.S. and Russian investment and business cooperation has tremendous potential. Russia and the U.S. can offer each other so much in trade, digital, high tech and in space exploration. We see that arctic cooperation is also very possible, in our international context. For example, between the far east of Russia and the West Coast of the U.S.",
      "Overall, it's very important for our countries to turn the page to go back to cooperation. It is symbolic that, not far away from here, the border between Russia and the US, there was a so-called International Date Line. I think you can step over, literally, from yesterday into tomorrow, and I hope that's- will succeed in that, in the political sphere. I would like to thank President Trump for our joint work, for the well wishing and trustworthy tone of our conversation.",
      "It's important that both sides are result-oriented and we see that the president of the U.S. has a very clear idea of what he would like to achieve. He sincerely cares about the prosperity of his nation. Still, he understands that Russia has its own national interests.",
      "I expect that today's agreements will be the starting point, not only for the solution of the Ukrainian issue, but also will help us bring back business-like and pragmatic relations between Russia and the U.S.",
      "And in the end, I would like to add one more thing. I'd like to remind you that in 2022, during the last contact with the previous administration, I tried to convince my previous American colleague, it should not- the situation should not be brought to the point of no return, when it would come to hostilities and accept it quite directly back then, that is a big mistake. Today, when President Trump is saying that if he was the president back then, there would be no war, and I'm quite sure that it would indeed be so. I can confirm that. I think that overall, me and President Trump have built a very good business-like and trustworthy contact, and have every reason to believe that moving down this path, we can come and assume it better to the end of the conflict in Ukraine. Thank you. Thank you.",
      "TRUMP: Thank you very much, Mr. President, that was very profound, and I will say that I believe we had a very productive meeting. There were many, many points that we agreed on, most of them, I would say, a couple of big ones that we haven't quite gotten there, but we've made some headway. So there's no deal until there's a deal.",
      "I will call up NATO in a little while, I will call up the various people that I think are appropriate, and I'll of course, call up President Zelenskyy and tell him about today's meeting. It's ultimately up to them. They're going to have to agree with what Marco and Steve and some of the great people from the Trump administration who've come here, Scott and John Ratcliffe. Thank you very much. But we have some of our really great leaders. They've been doing a phenomenal job.",
      "We also have some tremendous Russian business representatives here. And I think, you know, everybody wants to deal with us. We've become the hottest country anywhere in the world in a very short period of time, and we look forward to that. We look forward to dealing- we're going to try and get this over with.",
      "We really made some great progress today. I've always had a fantastic relationship with President Putin, with Vladimir. We had many, many tough meetings, good meetings. We were interfered with by the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax. It made it a little bit tougher to deal with, but he understood it. I think he's probably seen things like that during the course of his career. He's seen- he's seen it all. But we had to put up with the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax. He knew it was a hoax, and I knew it was a hoax, but what was done was very criminal, but it made it harder for us to deal as a country, in terms of the business, and all of the things that would like to have dealt with, but we'll have a good chance when this is over.",
      "So just to put it very quickly, I'm going to start making a few phone calls and tell them what happened. But we had an extremely productive meeting, and many points were agreed to. There are just a very few that are left. Some are not that significant. One is probably the most significant, but we have a very good chance of getting there. We didn't get there, but we have a very good chance of getting there. I would like to thank President Putin and his entire team, whose faces who I know, in many cases, otherwise, other than that, whose- whose faces I get to see all the time in the newspapers, you're very- you're almost as famous as the boss, but especially this one right over here.",
      "But we had some good meetings over the years, right? Good, productive meetings over the years, and we hope to have that in the future. Let's do the most productive one right now. We're going to stop, really, 5, 6, 7 thousand, 1000s of people a week from being killed, and President Putin wants to see that as much as I do. So again, Mr. President, I'd like to thank you very much, and we'll speak to you very soon, and probably see you again very soon. Thank you very much, Vladimir.",
      "PUTIN: Next time in Moscow.",
      "TRUMP: Ooh, that's an interesting one. I don't know. I'll get a little heat on that one, but I could see it possibly happening. Thank you very much, Vladimir, and thank you all. Thank you. Thank you.",

      "Prosecutors allege that in October 2021, Cantrell and Jeffrey Vappie, her bodyguard, developed a \"personal, intimate relationship,\" said Michael Simpson, acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Louisiana.",
      "Since Vappie's retirement in June 2024, the two had \"embarked on a scheme to defraud the city of New Orleans and the New Orleans Police Department,\" Simpson said during a news conference on Friday.",
      "The indictment alleges that Vappie was paid as if he was working when he and the mayor met alone in apartments and traveled to vineyards. Simpson said Cantrell arranged for Vappie to be on at least 14 domestic and international trips to \"maximize their time together and to engage in personal activities.\"",
      "\"In total, the city of New Orleans paid over $70,000 for Vappie's travel on these trips alone,\" Simpson said.",

      "Clinton made the comments on the podcast \"Raging Moderates\" with Jessica Tarlov, as Mr. Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet in Alaska to discuss a possible end to Russia's war in Ukraine.",
      "\"Honestly, if he could bring about the end to this terrible war, where Putin is the aggressor, invading a neighbor country, trying to change the borders \u2014 if he could end it without putting Ukraine in a position where it had to concede its territory to the aggressor, had to, in a way, validate Putin's vision of greater Russia, but instead could really stand up to Putin, something we haven't seen, but maybe this is the opportunity,\" Clinton said.",
      "\"To make it clear that there must be a ceasefire. There will be no exchange of territory. And that, over a period of time, Putin should be actually withdrawing from the territory he's seized in order to demonstrate his good-faith efforts, let us say, not to threaten European security,\" she continued. \"If we could pull that off, if President Trump were the architect of that, I'd nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize, because my goal here is to not allow capitulation to Putin, aided and abetted by the United States. I think that's a terrible, terrible precedent.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Aug 2025 17:27:50 -0400",
    "summary": "As less young people meet major economic milestones such as moving out and getting married, the concept of adulthood is changing.",
    "story": [
      "Fewer young adults are achieving economic and family milestones typically associated with adulthood, according to a recent working\u00a0paper\u00a0from the U.S. Census Bureau.",
      "The paper looked at nationally representative data from 2005 and 2023 to examine changes in young adults' experiences reaching major life events, such as moving out of their parents' house, getting married, and having a child. Researchers found a dramatic shift in the attainment of these milestones in recent decades.",
      "The reason for this, according to the paper, is that more young adults between the ages of 25 and 34 are facing economic barriers compared with previous generations. Changing societal attitudes around family formation are also contributing to the sharp decline in the share of young people reaching what the U.S. Census Bureau considers to be \"key milestones.\"",
      "According to the working paper, \"Changes in Milestones of Adulthood,\" almost half of all young adults in 1975 had reached four milestones associated with adulthood: moving out of one's parents' home, getting a job, getting married and having a child.",
      "Five decades on, that progression has changed dramatically. The share of young adults that have followed the traditional pathway to adulthood has dropped to less than a quarter, according to the paper.",
      "\"...Living arrangements, economic opportunities and attitudes toward family formation have not been experienced in the same fashion across generations of young adults,\" the working paper reads. \"Increases in job turbulence and economic downturns, for example, have resulted in some young adults navigating more volatile and uncertain economic environments.\"",
      "Economic conditions, combined with changing cultural norms, \"have implications for how young people develop their identity as adults,\" the paper states.",
      "This redefinition of young adulthood comes as the cost of everyday essentials, including housing, food, gas and daycare rises. As a result, more Americans are choosing to forego having a family, in some cases because they deem such choices unaffordable, the study finds.",
      "Researchers measured changes in the achievement of individual milestones, too. While one-quarter of young adults achieved all four milestones, 28% met two economic milestones \u2014 moving out of their parents' homes and finding jobs.",
      "Women in the workforce",
      "In the 1970s, getting married, having a child, and living independently, were the second-most common group of milestones young people achieved, next to the completion of all four.",
      "Women's gains in the workforce, along with changing cultural attitudes, however, have led this combination of milestones to become less popular, the report notes.",
      "The completion of education, another marker of adulthood, has overshadowed other milestones over the years as an increasing number of young adults enroll in college, according to the paper.",
      "\"These higher levels of educational attainment result in contemporary cohorts spending a longer portion of their young adult lives enrolled in higher education, potentially delaying other markers of adulthood such as entering the labor force or marriage,\" the working paper states.",
      "When it comes to perceptions of adulthood, having a job takes precedence over marriage, as young adults see economic achievements as more directly tied to adulthood than they do committing to a spouse.",
      "\"Marriage is increasingly viewed as a capstone of adulthood, something to pursue after achieving economic stability through completing formal education, establishing an independent household and becoming employed,\" the working paper states.",

    "summary": "Environmental groups and independent scientists are criticizing a report assembled by a small team of well-known climate skeptics selected by Energy Secretary Chris Wright.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has reduced funding for climate research, dismissed federal scientists who worked on the National Climate Assessment, and removed past editions of the report from government websites. Now, critics say, it is taking the next step: rewriting the science itself, according to a lawsuit filed this week by environmental groups.",
      "As the Environmental Protection Agency moves to revoke the Endangerment Finding, the 2009 scientific determination that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and can be regulated under the Clean Air Act, the Department of Energy published a\u00a0new review of the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on U.S. climate that aims to support the EPA's efforts.",
      "The report was developed this spring by the 2025 Climate Working Group, which is composed of five independent climate scientists selected by Energy Secretary Chris Wright.",
      "But environmental groups and independent scientists have criticized the report and how it was written, claiming it was assembled in secret by the five scientists who are recognized by the larger scientific community as climate skeptics.",
      "\"The secret report was produced by a set of known climate contrarians who were commissioned to write this report that's full of inaccuracies,\" said Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director of climate and energy programs at the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"It's clearly geared towards trying to give the EPA a way to evade its legal responsibility to address the health harms of heat trapping emissions and climate change.\"",
      "A \"secret report\"",
      "The DOE report, entitled \"A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S. Climate,\" was commissioned in March when Wright assembled the group to undertake a massive review of scientific findings in a very short period of time, with no public announcement of this effort.",
      "The five authors delivered their final draft by May 28. In the report's preface, the authors wrote, \"The short timeline and the technical nature of the material meant that we could not comprehensively review all topics.\"",
      "Their report argues that carbon-driven warming may be less economically damaging than commonly believed, and that aggressive U.S. climate policies would have little measurable impact on the global climate. It attributes some warming to natural climate cycles or changes in the sun, instead of the burning of fossil fuels, and also claims sea level rise has not been accelerating, contrary to widely accepted scientific evidence. Finally, it highlights the potential benefits of rising carbon dioxide levels for plant growth.",
      "\"I would say that it presents an incomplete and misleading picture of how climate change is affecting the United States,\" said Phil Duffy, chief scientist at Spark Climate Solutions, who previously worked in the Biden and Obama administrations as a science policy expert.",
      "Duffy and other scientists say the DOE report cherry-picks evidence, misrepresents peer-reviewed research, and ignores the overwhelming consensus that human activity is driving dangerous warming. Numerous climate-based groups and researchers have published their own fact-checks on the report, with one listing more than 100 false or misleading claims made by the authors.",
      "CBS News reached out to the Department of Energy about the criticisms of the report. They responded by referring to Wright's statement in the preface, where he wrote that he chose the panel \"for their rigor, honesty, and willingness to elevate the debate.\"",
      "\"This DOE report is in service of a political goal, it's not credible science,\" said Ben Santer, a climate researcher and board member of the Union of Concerned Scientists. Santer says his own published work was misrepresented in the DOE report and said the authors \"fundamentally twist\" the work of many researchers to reach conclusions that \"will be used for a political purpose.\"",
      "Critics in the scientific community have pointed out that the panel's five authors are known for their contrarian views on climate science, which are often at odds with the scientific consensus on the causes of climate change.",
      "\"The people that were handpicked by the Trump administration's energy secretary are this very small group of people who are known to disagree with that mountain of [scientific] evidence,\" said Vickie Patton, general counsel at the Environmental Defense Fund. \"Some of them have connections to the fossil fuel industry.\"",
      "Accusations of rewriting science",
      "Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former oil and gas executive, has been vocal about his views on climate change, which align with the report's findings. In an op-ed earlier this year, he called climate change \"a by-product of progress,\" and wrote, \"I am willing to take the modest negative trade-off for this legacy of human advancement.\" He argues that while climate change is real, it is not the greatest threat, and that expanding access to affordable, reliable energy should remain the priority.",
      "Wright has been transparent about how he views U.S. climate research, telling CNN's Kaitlan Collins that the administration is reviewing past federal climate reports, including the National Climate Assessment, and may provide \"updates\" later this year, leading many in the scientific community to fear the administration is aiming to edit or censor critical research.",
      "\"It's important that science be allowed to speak for itself and I do have concerns that that's not happening,\" Duffy told CBS News.",
      "National Climate Assessments typically take years to write and are authored by hundreds of scientists.",
      "Duffy says that Wright didn't oversee the previous reports and therefore has no authority to review or revise them. \"He can't rewrite the National Climate Assessment any more than I can rewrite 'The Great Gatsby,'\" Duffy says.",
      "The Environmental Defense Fund and Union of Concerned Scientists filed a lawsuit Tuesday in federal court against the EPA and the Department of Energy, arguing that their actions violated the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which requires transparency and balanced membership for government advisory panels. The suit alleges that the Climate Working Group was created in secret, its work withheld from the public, and then its report was used extensively by the EPA, cited 22 times, to justify repealing the Endangerment Finding. The organizations are asking a judge to block the government's use of the report to comply with transparency laws.",
      "When asked about the lawsuit, the EPA responded in an email saying, \"As a matter of longstanding practice, EPA does not comment on current or pending litigation,\" and referred CBS News to the Department of Energy. The Department of Energy did not respond to any of our requests for comment.",

Just under half of the parents polled by the survey said they expect their child's lunch to cost more this September than it did in 2024.",

      "The public media company's board approved the budget cut Wednesday, according to the PBS spokesperson.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/social-security-90th-anniversary-funding-insolvency/",
    "published": "Fri, 15 Aug 2025 14:50:37 -0400",
    "summary": "As Social Security celebrates its 90th anniversary, concerns are growing over its funding and recent staffing cuts.",
    "story": [
      "Social Security celebrated its 90th anniversary Thursday, marking a major milestone for the program that supplies monthly benefit checks to almost 70 million senior citizens, disabled people and surviving family members of deceased workers.",
      "When President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law on Aug. 14, 1935, he guaranteed for the first time that workers could rely on continuing income in retirement after they turned 65. As it enters its 10th decade, the program is only growing in importance amid an aging population, with a record number of Americans now collecting benefits.",
      "In the next 10 years, Social Security is expected to swell by an additional 12 million recipients, according to the AARP. But even as it grows in importance, the program is also facing mounting problems and growing questions over its long term viability.",
      "While many policy experts believe the program should be expanded, its outgoings now far outpace its income. Some Democratic lawmakers are also questioning the agency's ability to serve retirees after the Trump administration earlier this year made cuts to its workforce in what the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities referred to\u00a0as the \"largest staffing cut in SSA's history.\"",
      "As these challenges have mounted, faith in the program has deteriorated, even as three-quarters of Americans say they believe Social Security is \"one of the most important programs\" the government offers, according to a recent AARP survey. Confidence in the future of Social Security has declined by 7% in the last five years, from 43% in 2020 to 36% in 2025, it found.",
      "Asked about these concerns, the Social Security Administration pointed to a Fox News interview Thursday with its commissioner, Frank Bisignano, who said he's optimistic about the program's future and that the agency is working on improving its operations.",
      "The White House also took issue with the criticisms, with spokeswoman Liz Huston telling CBS News that the administration is improving customer service and \"preventing illegal aliens from accessing benefits. \"President Trump has made Social Security great again,\" she said.",
      "Funding woes",
      "A major headwind facing Social Security may not be new, but it is fast approaching: The possible insolvency of its trust funds as the gap between its revenue and expenditure grows.",
      "For instance, in 2024, the program cost $1.49 trillion, but total income was $1.42 trillion, according to the 2025 Social Security Board of Trustees' report.",
      "Because of that trend \u2014 which is expected to continue given the aging population \u2014 the Social Security trust funds are forecast to be\u00a0depleted by 2034, one year sooner than previously forecast, according to the most recent trustees' report. This so-called \"go-broke\" date has been a major source of stress for Americans who worry that there won't be enough money left by the time they reach retirement age.",
      "While some workers believe that the trust funds' insolvency means Social Security will cease making payments after that date, that is incorrect. Because the program is funded through payroll taxes, Social Security has a constant stream of income \u2014 although without the trust funds' financial cushion, the program will face a shortfall, leading to a cut in benefits.",
      "Without a fix, monthly benefits could be cut by as much as 23%, the Social Security Board of Trustees warned in its 2025\u00a0annual report.",
      "But there are options for shoring up the trust funds. For one, there's a current cap on the amount of income subject to Social Security taxes, which stands at $176,100 in 2025, meaning any earnings above that amount are exempt from the payroll tax.",
      "One remedy would be to lift the cap on payroll taxes, an option that some Democratic lawmakers prefer. Another idea, floated by some Republican lawmakers, is to raise the retirement age, which currently stands at 67 for people born after 1960.",
      "Changes under President Trump",
      "President Trump has vowed not to cut Social Security, noting in a \"Meet the Press\" interview in December that \"we're not touching Social Security, other than we might make it more efficient.\" Nonetheless, concerns have mounted over the Trump administration's changes to the program, including cuts to its staff and the closure of some field offices.",
      "During a press call Wednesday organized by advocacy groups, Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, claimed Mr. Trump and others in his administration are \"working overtime to try to dismantle Social Security.\"",
      "Many Americans also say they're worried about what sort of changes the new administration could make. According to a new\u00a0survey\u00a0from NerdWallet, 61% of Americans believe Social Security benefits will be cut under the current administration.",
      "The White House, however, contends that Social Security has become more efficient under Mr. Trump's leadership. In a statement released Thursday, the White House claimed that the agency is handling 70% more calls than last year and that it has cut down on wait times with the help of technology. It also said the average wait times for customers at field offices have declined by 23%.",
      "\"We have taken steps to reduce wait times, enhance security, and make it easier to navigate our programs,\" SSA commissioner Frank Bisignano wrote in an opinion piece for Fox News on Thursday. \"All the while ensuring we pay benefits accurately to those who are eligible to receive them.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Thursday repeated his\u00a0promises to protect the program.",
      "The program will become \"stronger, bigger and better\" and is \"gonna be around a long time\" with Republicans in charge, he added in remarks from the White House.",

The second data breach, announced in\u00a0July 2024, involved hackers unlawfully downloading AT&T data from a third-party cloud platform, exposing the records of calls and texts of \"nearly all\" of AT&T's cellular customers.",
      "Multiple lawsuits were filed in state and federal courts across the country after both incidents, which were ultimately consolidated into two class-action cases.",
      "Following a ruling from a federal judge, the settlement administration for AT&T\u00a0said on Aug. 4 that a proposed settlement has been reached for $177 million, with $149 million earmarked for the first settlement class and $28 million set aside for the second settlement class.",
      "The settlement, however, still has to be approved. According to the settlement website, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas will hold a final approval hearing on Dec. 3, 2025. In the meantime, impacted AT&T customers can file for compensation.",

      "As stated on the settlement website, if you file a claim, you give up your right to sue AT&T.",
      "How much will I get?",
      "People whose data was exposed in the breach announced in March 2024 are eligible for up to $5,000 and can make claims for \"payment for losses that occurred in 2019, or later,\" according to the settlement website.",
      "Those who were part of the second breach announced in July of last year are eligible for up to $2,500 \"for losses that occurred on or after April 14, 2024,\" the settlement administration said.",

      "Researchers say that a lake trout recently captured in Lake Superior is believed to be the oldest-known specimen of its species ever caught in the Great Lakes, estimated to be 62 years old.",
      "The fish was collected at Klondike Reef in autumn 2023 by researchers with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, along with multiple universities and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.",
      "According to the DNR, one of the fish specimens collected may not have tipped any physical records scales, weighing in under 5 pounds and measuring just over 2 feet in length, but it certainly qualifies as the oldest fish ever documented among the five Great Lakes.",
      "The fish is believed to have hatched in 1961, long before a man walked on the moon, long before the first known test-tube baby, and even before President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. DNR officials said, with some whimsical logic, that if the fish were to have gone through human schooling, it would have graduated the same year as former president Barack Obama and Princess Diana of Wales.",
      "A typical lake trout in Lake Superior is thought to be roughly 25 to 30 years old. Prior to this new discovery, the oldest trout reported in the lake was estimated to have reached 42 years of age.",
      "Researchers determined the age of the fish by counting the number of \"rings\" visible on the fish's otolith, or \"ear stone,\" which grows through the years of a fish's life.",
      "The Michigan DNR said that staffers have taken to calling the fish \"Mary Catherine,\" as Mary was among the most common names given to baby girls the year the trout was born.",
      "Officials say that they take samples of fish to track population health, and the discovery of Mary Catherine indicates that lake trout are doing well in Lake Superior.",

    "summary": "A CBS News analysis of FAA data reveals frequent red flags in flight paths near Reagan Washington National Airport in the year before January's deadly midair collision.",
    "story": [
      "Helicopters flew above altitude limits or close to landing and departing airplanes almost daily at Washington's Reagan National Airport in the year before January's deadly midair collision, a CBS News data analysis of recently released Federal Aviation Administration data reveals.",
      "On the same routes as the Army Black Hawk involved in the collision, helicopters came within 500 feet of airplanes landing or departing from the airport's runways 99 times in 2024, the analysis shows. That's an average of nearly twice per week. Encounters within 1,000 feet occurred multiple times per day.",
      "In the year leading up to the collision with an American Airlines flight, claiming the lives of all 67 aboard the two aircraft, one out of every 10 helicopters flying in that area were above the route's 200-foot altitude limit, according to analysis of the FAA data released as part of the National Transportation Safety Board's investigation into the crash.",
      "The route was already tight, offering a maximum of 75 feet of margin between helicopters passing through and landing airplanes flying overhead, NTSB officials have concluded.",
      "\"What I'm trying to figure out is how do we not find this out until after an accident,\" the NTSB's Jennifer Homendy asked after presenting the FAA data during investigative hearings on Aug. 1. \"How do we ensure that data is being evaluated and shared?\"",
      "\"None of the airlines had identified any of the risk here, the Army hadn't identified the risk here, and we hadn't identified the risk,\" FAA acting deputy chief operations officer Nick Fuller said in response to the questioning. \"I hope that the AI tools that we're developing will find some of the things that we are missing that we just can't catch, because most of the operations that we looked into were actually compliant.\"",
      "Robert Sumwalt, former chair of the NTSB and CBS News' transportation safety expert and analyst, said the newly-public FAA data indicates such close operations between helicopters and airplanes may have been normalized.",
      "\"So, therefore it just looked like noise in the data that people really were not taking it as a serious risk. And as we now know the risk was unacceptable,\" Sumwalt said.",
      "The FAA has been evaluating helicopter flight data for airports nationwide, relying on data similar to the information analyzed by CBS News. The effort has already led to safety changes at some airports, including Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas, where FAA officials said helicopter close encounters declined 30% in three weeks after action was taken earlier this year.",
      "\"The FAA took quick action after the accident to stop mixed traffic in the DC airspace,\" a statement released Thursday by the agency said. \"We continue to work with the NTSB to support the ongoing investigation.\"",
      "The data analyzed by CBS News came from two FAA studies completed in the months after the January crash, including one initiated by the NTSB. One examined helicopter altitudes near the airport in the year leading up to the crash and the other examined encounters between aircraft over periods of various lengths up to 52 months before the crash.",
      "A third study has been requested but not yet received from the FAA, according to NTSB officials.",
      "At least half of the helicopters flying routes within five miles of Washington National in the year before the collision were military flights, the FAA data showed.",
      "Those flying missions similar to the Black Hawk involved in the crash came within 1,000 feet of other aircraft 687 times over the course of 52 months leading up to the crash. That's an average of more than three times per week.",
      "The American Airlines flight from Wichita, Kansas\u00a0involved in the collision was operated by PSA Airlines on a Bombardier CRJ-700 regional airliner. Both the airline and that model of jet were the most likely to depart or land at the airport during the 52 months leading up to the crash, the CBS News analysis of FAA data shows. They were also the most likely aircraft types to end up within 1,000 feet of a helicopter. The airline's flights were involved in a close encounter an average of four times per week, the analysis of FAA data shows.",
      "The NTSB's investigation into the collision is ongoing. A final report with determinations about the probable cause is likely within the next year.",

    "story": [
      "A group of rabbits in Colorado with grotesque, hornlike growths may seem straight out of a low-budget horror film, but scientists say there's no reason to be spooked \u2014 the furry creatures merely have a relatively common virus.",
      "The cottontails recently spotted in Fort Collins are infected with the mostly harmless Shope papillomavirus, which causes wart-like growths that protrude from their faces like metastasizing horns.",
      "Viral photos have inspired a fluffle of unflattering nicknames, including \"Frankenstein bunnies,\" \"demon rabbits\" and \"zombie rabbits.\" But their affliction is nothing new, with the virus inspiring ancient folklore and fueling scientific research nearly 100 years ago.",
      "The virus likely influenced the centuries-old jackalope myth in North America, which told of a rabbit with antlers or horns, among other animal variations. The disease in rabbits also contributed to scientists' knowledge about the connection between viruses and cancer, such as the human papillomavirus that causes cervical cancer.",
      "The virus in rabbits was named after Dr. Richard E Shope, a professor at The Rockefeller University who discovered the disease in cottontails in the 1930s.",
      "News about the rabbit sightings in Fort Collins, 65 miles north of Denver, started getting attention after residents started spotting them around town and posting pictures.",
      "\"It looks like it was black quills or black toothpicks sticking out all around his or her mouth,\" Susan Mansfield, a Fort Collins resident who saw one of the rabbits, told 9News. \"I thought he would die off during the winter, but he didn't. He came back a second year, and it grew.\"",
      "Kara Van Hoose, a spokesperson for Colorado Parks and Wildlife, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the agency has been getting calls about the rabbits seen in Fort Collins.",
      "But she said that it's not uncommon to see infected rabbits, especially in the summer, when the fleas and ticks that spread the virus are most active. The virus can spread from rabbit to rabbit but not to other species, including humans and pets, she said.",
      "Rabbit papilloma is similar to human HPV-induced tumors, according to an article in the\u00a0National Library of Medicine, and human papillomavirus has been linked to skin cancer, according to a recent report.",
      "The growths resemble warts but can look like horns if they grow longer, Van Hoose said. The growths don't harm rabbits unless they grow on their eyes or mouths and interfere with eating. Rabbits' immune systems are able to fight the virus and, once they do, the growths will disappear, she said.",
      "The agency notes that the disease is more severe in domestic rabbits than in wild rabbits and should be treated by a veterinarian.",
      "Colorado is home to three different species of cottontail rabbits \u2014 the mountain cottontail, the desert cottontail and the eastern cottontail. The species differ mostly by color and are \"difficult or impossible to distinguish in the field, except by habitat and geographic location,\" Colorado Parks and Wildlife says.",

    "story": [
      "Erin has strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane as the storm continued on a path over the Atlantic Ocean, forecasters said. Early Friday, it became the first hurricane to develop in the Atlantic this year, and it was expected to continue gaining strength, potentially growing into a major hurricane.",
      "Forecasters with the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami have been urging people in the Caribbean islands to monitor Erin's progress, warning of the potential for heavy rainfall and life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.",
      "Erin is not currently forecast to impact the United States, but meteorologists continue to watch it closely.",
      "The center of Erin was forecast to move just north of the northern Leewards, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico over the weekend, the hurricane center said. Rainfall totals of up to 6 inches are possible for those islands, with the potential of flash flooding and mudslides, the hurricane center said.",
      "\"Steady to rapid strengthening is expected over the next few days, and Erin is forecast to become a major hurricane during the weekend,\" the hurricane center said.",
      "A major hurricane is defined as a Category 3 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of at least 111 mph.",
      "Maps show Hurricane Erin's forecast path",
      "Forecasters expected Erin's path to curve northward, with the hurricane likely passing near the northern Leewards on Saturday. The northern Leewards stretch from the Virgin Islands to Guadeloupe and include St. Martin, St. Barts and other islands. Officials have issued tropical storm watches for several islands, alerting people of the possibility of winds ranging between 39 mph and 73 mph.",

      "So far this year, Tropical Storm Chantal is the only one to have made landfall in the U.S., bringing deadly flooding to North Carolina in early July. In June, Barry made landfall as a tropical depression on Mexico's eastern coast.",
      "Erin's increased strength comes as the Atlantic hurricane season approaches its peak in September. According to the hurricane center, most of the season's activity typically happens between mid-August and mid-October. In the eastern Pacific Ocean, hurricane season starts on May 15 with a peak in activity typically seen in late August.",

    "summary": "Both President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered brief remarks, but took no questions, in Alaska.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin left Alaska Friday without a ceasefire agreement, although both men described the meeting as constructive.",
      "In what was billed by the White House as a press conference following their meeting, Mr. Trump and Putin took no questions, ignoring shouted ones from reporters.",
      "Putin spoke little of Ukraine, focusing on the bond and heritage between the U.S. and Russia, while Mr. Trump said many points were agreed to, and a few are left, regarding Ukraine. The U.S. president plans to call European leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, he said.",
      "Here is a transcript of what Mr. Trump and Putin said:",
      "PUTIN: Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, our negotiations have been held in a constructive atmosphere of mutual respect.",
      "We have very thorough negotiations that were quite useful. I would like to thank once again my American counterpart, for the proposal to travel out here to Alaska. It only makes sense that we've met here, because our countries, though separated by the oceans, are close neighbors. So when we've met, when I came out of the plane and I said, 'Good afternoon, dear neighbor. Very good to see you in good health and to see you alive.' I think that is very neighborly. I think that's some kind words that we can say to each other. We're separated by the strait of Bering, though, there are two islands only between the Russian Island and the U.S. Island. They're only four kilometers apart. We are close neighbors, and it's a fact.",
      "It's also important that Alaska has to do with our common heritage, common history between Russia and the U.S., and many positive events have to do with that territory. Still, there is tremendous cultural heritage, back from the Russian America, for example, Orthodox churches, and a lot of- more than 700 geographical names of Russian origin. During the Second World War, it was here in Alaska that was the origin of the legendary air bridge for the supply of military aircraft and other equipment under the Lend-Lease Program.",
      "It was a dangerous and treacherous route over the vast emptiness of ice. However, the pilots of both countries did everything to bring closer the victory. They risked their lives and they gave it all for the common victory. I was just in the city of Magadan in Russia. And there is a memorial there dedicated to the Russian, the U.S. pilots. And there are two flags, the U.S. flag and the Russian flag. And I know that here as well, there is such a memorial. There is a military burial place several kilometers away from here. The Soviet pilots are buried there who died during that dangerous mission. We're thankful to the citizens and the government of the U.S. for carefully taking care of their memory. I think that's very worthy and noble. We'll always remember other historical examples when our countries defeated common enemies together in the spirit of battle camaraderie and allyship that supported each other and facilitated each other. I am sure that this heritage will help us rebuild and foster mutually beneficial and equal ties at this new stage, even during the hardest conditions.",
      "It is known that there have been no summits between Russia and the U.S. for four years, and that's a long time. This time was very hard for bilateral relations, and let's be frank, they've fallen to the lowest point since the Cold War. I think that's not benefiting our countries and the world as a whole. It is apparent that sooner or later, we have to amend the situation to move on from the confrontation to dialog, and in this case, a personal meeting between the heads of state has been long overdue, naturally, under the condition of serious and painstaking work, and this work has been done.",
      "In general, me and President Trump have very good direct contact. We've spoken multiple times. We spoke frankly on the phone. And the special envoy of the president, Mr. Witkoff, traveled out to Russia several times. Our advisers and heads of foreign ministries kept in touch all the time, and we know fully well that one of the central issues was the situation around Ukraine.",
      "We see the strive of the administration and President Trump personally to help facilitate the resolution of the Ukrainian conflict, and his strive to get to the crux of the matter, to understand this history, is precious. As I've said, the situation in Ukraine has to do with fundamental threats to our security. Moreover, we've always considered the Ukrainian nation, and I've said it multiple times, a brotherly nation. How strange it may sound in these conditions. We have the same roots, and everything that's happening is a tragedy for us, and terrible wound. Therefore, the country is sincerely interested in putting an end to it.",
      "At the same time, we're convinced that in order to, to make the settlement lasting and long term, we need to eliminate all the primary roots, the primary causes of that conflict, and we've said it multiple times, to consider all legitimate concerns of Russia and to reinstate a just balance of security in Europe and in the world on the whole, and agree with President Trump, as he has said today, that naturally, the security of Ukraine should be ensured as well. Naturally, we are prepared to work on that.",
      "I would like to hope that the agreement that we've reached together will help us bring closer that goal and will pave the path towards peace in Ukraine. We expect that Kyiv and European capitals will perceive that constructively and that they won't throw a wrench in the works. They will not make any attempts to use some backroom dealings to conduct provocations to torpedo the nascent progress.",
      "Incidentally, when the new administration came to power, bilateral trade started to grow. It's still very symbolic. Still, we have a growth of 20%. As I've said, we have a lot of dimensions for joint work. It is clear that the U.S. and Russian investment and business cooperation has tremendous potential. Russia and the U.S. can offer each other so much in trade, digital, high tech and in space exploration. We see that arctic cooperation is also very possible, in our international context. For example, between the far east of Russia and the West Coast of the U.S.",
      "Overall, it's very important for our countries to turn the page to go back to cooperation. It is symbolic that, not far away from here, the border between Russia and the US, there was a so-called International Date Line. I think you can step over, literally, from yesterday into tomorrow, and I hope that's- will succeed in that, in the political sphere. I would like to thank President Trump for our joint work, for the well wishing and trustworthy tone of our conversation.",
      "It's important that both sides are result-oriented and we see that the president of the U.S. has a very clear idea of what he would like to achieve. He sincerely cares about the prosperity of his nation. Still, he understands that Russia has its own national interests.",
      "I expect that today's agreements will be the starting point, not only for the solution of the Ukrainian issue, but also will help us bring back business-like and pragmatic relations between Russia and the U.S.",
      "And in the end, I would like to add one more thing. I'd like to remind you that in 2022, during the last contact with the previous administration, I tried to convince my previous American colleague, it should not- the situation should not be brought to the point of no return, when it would come to hostilities and accept it quite directly back then, that is a big mistake. Today, when President Trump is saying that if he was the president back then, there would be no war, and I'm quite sure that it would indeed be so. I can confirm that. I think that overall, me and President Trump have built a very good business-like and trustworthy contact, and have every reason to believe that moving down this path, we can come and assume it better to the end of the conflict in Ukraine. Thank you. Thank you.",
      "TRUMP: Thank you very much, Mr. President, that was very profound, and I will say that I believe we had a very productive meeting. There were many, many points that we agreed on, most of them, I would say, a couple of big ones that we haven't quite gotten there, but we've made some headway. So there's no deal until there's a deal.",
      "I will call up NATO in a little while, I will call up the various people that I think are appropriate, and I'll of course, call up President Zelenskyy and tell him about today's meeting. It's ultimately up to them. They're going to have to agree with what Marco and Steve and some of the great people from the Trump administration who've come here, Scott and John Ratcliffe. Thank you very much. But we have some of our really great leaders. They've been doing a phenomenal job.",
      "We also have some tremendous Russian business representatives here. And I think, you know, everybody wants to deal with us. We've become the hottest country anywhere in the world in a very short period of time, and we look forward to that. We look forward to dealing- we're going to try and get this over with.",
      "We really made some great progress today. I've always had a fantastic relationship with President Putin, with Vladimir. We had many, many tough meetings, good meetings. We were interfered with by the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax. It made it a little bit tougher to deal with, but he understood it. I think he's probably seen things like that during the course of his career. He's seen- he's seen it all. But we had to put up with the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax. He knew it was a hoax, and I knew it was a hoax, but what was done was very criminal, but it made it harder for us to deal as a country, in terms of the business, and all of the things that would like to have dealt with, but we'll have a good chance when this is over.",
      "So just to put it very quickly, I'm going to start making a few phone calls and tell them what happened. But we had an extremely productive meeting, and many points were agreed to. There are just a very few that are left. Some are not that significant. One is probably the most significant, but we have a very good chance of getting there. We didn't get there, but we have a very good chance of getting there. I would like to thank President Putin and his entire team, whose faces who I know, in many cases, otherwise, other than that, whose- whose faces I get to see all the time in the newspapers, you're very- you're almost as famous as the boss, but especially this one right over here.",
      "But we had some good meetings over the years, right? Good, productive meetings over the years, and we hope to have that in the future. Let's do the most productive one right now. We're going to stop, really, 5, 6, 7 thousand, 1000s of people a week from being killed, and President Putin wants to see that as much as I do. So again, Mr. President, I'd like to thank you very much, and we'll speak to you very soon, and probably see you again very soon. Thank you very much, Vladimir.",
      "PUTIN: Next time in Moscow.",
      "TRUMP: Ooh, that's an interesting one. I don't know. I'll get a little heat on that one, but I could see it possibly happening. Thank you very much, Vladimir, and thank you all. Thank you. Thank you.",

    "story": [
      "Air Canada began canceling flights Thursday ahead of a possible strike by its flight attendants that could impact hundreds of thousands of travelers.",
      "A complete shutdown of the country's largest airline threatens to impact about 130,000 people a day.",
      "On Friday, the carrier said in a post on X that the \"wind down\" ahead of an impending strike had led to 294 flight cancellations, affecting 55,726 people.",
      "In a social media post Thursday, the airline\u00a0said\u00a0that nearly 300 flight attendants, \"twice as much as usual,\" did not report to work Thursday night.",
      "\"This will result in additional cancellations,\" the airline said. \"We regret the inconvenience to customers.\"",
      "Mark Nasr, chief operations officer for Air Canada, said the airline has begun a gradual suspension of Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge operations.",
      "\"All flights will be paused by Saturday early morning,\" he said.",
      "Nasr said this approach will help facilitate an orderly restart, \"which under the best circumstances will take a full week to complete.\"",
      "He said a first set of cancellations involving several dozen flights will impact long-haul overseas flights that were due to depart Thursday night.",
      "Late Thursday night, the carrier said on X that 34 flights had been canceled with almost 8,000 people impacted and 19 additional flights were canceled impacting more than 3,000 people \"due to unplanned crew book-offs.",
      "\"By tomorrow evening, we expect to have canceled flights affecting over 100,000 customers,\" Nasr said. \"By the time we get to 1 a.m. on Saturday morning, we will be completely grounded.\"",
      "He said a grounding will affect 25,000 Canadians a day abroad who may become stranded. They expect 500 flights to be canceled by the end of Friday.",
      "The union representing around 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants issued a 72-hour strike notice on Wednesday. If a deal isn't reached or the government doesn't intervene, the flight attendants will begin striking on Saturday, Aug. 16.",
      "In response to the strike notice, the airline issued a lockout notice.",
      "Nasr said customers whose flights are canceled will be eligible for a full refund, and said the airline has also made arrangements with other Canadian and foreign carriers to provide alternative travel options \"to the extent possible.\"",
      "\"We regret the impact a disruption will have on our customers, our stakeholders and the communities we serve,\" Air Canada CEO Michael Rousseau said in a previous statement.",
      "On Tuesday, Air Canada said it had reached an impasse with the union as the two sides remained far apart in contract talks. The union has said its main sticking points revolve around what it calls flight attendants' \"poverty wages\" and unpaid labor when planes aren't in the air, while Air Canada said it had offered a 38% increase in total pay over four years, as well as other benefits.",
      "\"Despite our best efforts, Air Canada refused to address our core issues,\" the union said in a bargaining update posted online.",
      "The union rejected a proposal from the airline to enter a binding arbitration process, saying it prefers to negotiate a deal that its members can then vote on.",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Aug 2025 13:05:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump visits Alaska Friday for a meeting with Russia's President Vladimir Putin \u2014 a discussion the White House has called a \"listening exercise.\"",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin sit down\u00a0in Alaska Friday for their high-stakes meeting about the war in Ukraine, the two leaders will bring differing ideas about ending the war that Russia began over three years ago. At the same time, Ukraine will be watching from the outside with European allies, hoping that Mr. Trump is protecting their interests.",
      "Their meetings are expected to be capped by a rare joint news conference with the two world leaders \u2014 the first such event of its kind since their 2018 summit in Helsinki, when Mr. Trump sided with Putin over his own intelligence agencies about Russian interference in the 2016 election.",
      "Expectations ahead of the Trump-Putin meeting",
      "Mr. Trump has tried to lower expectations going into the meeting, telling reporters the day before, \"all I want to do is set the table for the next meeting, which should happen shortly.\" The subsequent meeting is an idea he has been floating this week, and he said it would also include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and perhaps other allies. The president raised the possibility that Zelenskyy could even join them in Alaska within a couple of days.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt referred to talks with Putin as \"a listening exercise\" for Mr. Trump and said his goal \"is to walk away with a better understanding of how we can end this war.\"",
      "There are a number of questions going into the summit \u2014 chief among them is what Russia wants, and whether there's a way to reconcile its demands with what Ukraine wants. U.S. and Russian counterparts have been speaking, and Mr. Trump and Putin have had their own phone conversations.",
      "In March, Ukraine agreed to a 30-day ceasefire proposal backed by the U.S., and months later, in May, when the Kremlin had still not accepted the terms, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. was trying to figure out if Russia was just \"tapping us along.\"",
      "By July, casualties were mounting in Ukraine as Russia stepped up its bombing campaign with hundreds of missile and drone strikes. Mr. Trump gave Putin a 50-day deadline to agree to a deal to end the war, and later shortened it to a 10-day deadline, threatening harsher tariffs and secondary sanctions. Dmitri Medvedev, the former president of Russia, responded by mocking Mr. Trump on X. \"Each new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war,\" he said, warning that it would not be \"between Russia and Ukraine, but with [Trump's] own country.\"",
      "But a day before the president's 10-day deadline expired \u2014 and after Putin had met with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff \u2014 the Kremlin announced that Putin and Mr. Trump would meet.",
      "Mr. Trump on Wednesday said there would be \"very severe consequences\" for Russia if it doesn't agree to end the war after Friday's meeting, though he declined to elaborate.",
      "Zelenskyy and European partners met virtually with Mr. Trump Wednesday, after which Zelenskyy wrote on X: \"Together with our partners, we supported the efforts of U.S. President Donald Trump to end the war, stop the killings, and achieve a just and lasting peace. I am grateful to the partners for our shared position: the path to peace.\"",
      "European leaders have been wary of the Trump-Putin meeting. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Wednesday of the summit, \"The most important thing is that Europe convinces Donald Trump that one can't trust Russia,\" adding, \"no one should think of recognizing Russia's right to demarcate borders for its neighbors.\" Zelenskyy won't be there to represent Ukraine's interests, and Mr. Trump has shown he's sometimes reluctant to criticize Putin.",
      "What Russia wants",
      "Experts say Putin has several objectives that won't be shared by the U.S. and Ukraine, and Mr. Trump must exercise caution.",
      "Putin would love to see the U.S. discontinue its financial support for Ukraine, said Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies' Center on Military and Political Power.",
      "\"He wants to sideline the power of the United States so that he can more effectively prey on Ukraine,\" Bowman said, adding that at the same time, Putin will \"try to make the invaded look like the villain.\" While Mr. Trump aims to end the war Russia began, Putin is likely to try to seize on Mr. Trump's desire for peace.",
      "\"He's going to try to gain Trump's support for a bad peace,\" Bowman said, adding, \"Some peace agreements are bad because they lead to more war.\"",
      "John Lough, an associate fellow in the Russia and Eurasia program and the British think-tank Chatham House, predicted that Russia would \"put something in front of [Trump] that he will buy into and say, 'This is a way out of the war, and I like that, and I'm now prepared to go lean on the Ukrainians again and the Europeans and we'll get this over the line.'\"",
      "But Lough also believes that for Russia, the meeting is \"high risk.\"",
      "\"They may not get what they want, but they will at the very least be hoping that it guides the sort of next phase of the process of getting Ukraine to the table, and, I suppose, conducting the negotiations within a framework with which that comes,\" Lough said.",
      "Russia, Lough said, wants \"to get the framework of the peace agreement settled and then talk about a ceasefire, whereas Ukraine, its allies and, to a degree, President Trump has said, 'No, we start with a cease fire and then we build around that.'\"",
      "Daniel Fried, a former U.S. ambassador to Poland and former assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, thinks Putin could try to insert a wedge between the U.S. and its allies.",
      "\"He wants to get out of this meeting without any cost and to slice away at the American position and maybe draw Trump out so that there's a gap between him and Zelenskyy, Trump and the Europeans,\" Fried said in a press call Wednesday.",
      "After Mr. Trump's more skeptical comments about Putin since the meeting was scheduled, Fried said, \"I am less worried about that than I was three days ago.\"",
      "Fried, who is now a fellow at the Atlantic Council, said that for Putin, a great outcome would be to \"dazzle\" Mr. Trump with a fake offer and to walk away with a big smile.",
      "At talks in June, the Kremlin presented a memorandum offering Ukraine two options for a 30-day ceasefire, which could give some insight into Putin's maximalist demands.",
      "The first would have required Ukraine to withdraw its forces from four regions illegally annexed by Russia, but which Russia never fully controlled: Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.",
      "The second option involved a number of conditions including a requirement that Ukraine wind down its military effort, cease receiving military aid, exclude any international military forces from its territory, lift martial law and then swiftly hold an election.",
      "As part of a peace treaty, Russia said it would require international recognition of Russian sovereignty over some Ukrainian territories it currently occupies, including Donbas and Crimea, and a pledge by Ukraine not to join any military alliances \u2014 an end to its efforts to join NATO \u2014 or allow any foreign militaries to operate or have bases in its territory.",
      "Russia also said it would want a cap on the strength of Ukraine's armed forces and for Russian to become an official language in Ukraine.",
      "Wendy Sherman, a former deputy secretary of state who has sat across from Putin before, said the Russian leader has no real interest in ending this war \u2014 he is simply \"buying time.\"",
      "\"This is President Putin's meeting,\" Sherman told CBS News Wednesday. \"He really is in charge of this meeting. He asked for it. The president, I think, was flattered to have this meeting. But Putin has no interest in ending this war. He is very smart, he is very cagey.\"",
      "What Ukraine wants",
      "Ukraine wants an end to Russia's assault and its full withdrawal from their territory.",
      "\"There must be an honest end to the war. And it depends on Russia,\" Zelenskyy said on social media earlier this month. \"It is Russia that must end the war it started.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said earlier this week that a ceasefire agreement between Russia and Ukraine would involve \"some land swapping going on. I know that through Russia and through conversations with everybody. To the good, for the good of Ukraine. Good stuff, not bad stuff. Also, some bad stuff for both.\"",
      "That prompted a response from Zelenskyy, who said Ukraine would not give up any of its territory to Russia. Ukraine's constitution does not allow him to formally cede parts of the country.",
      "\"We will not reward Russia for what it has perpetrated,\" Zelenskyy said in a social media post last weekend. \"The answer to the Ukrainian territorial question already is in the Constitution of Ukraine. No one will deviate from this \u2014 and no one will be able to. Ukrainians will not gift their land to the occupier.\"",
      "Despite such statements, John Herbst, senior director of the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center, said Zelenskyy has demonstrated he's willing to compromise.",
      "\"There is no doubt in my mind that Zelenskyy understands that territorial concessions may be required to get a durable peace,\" Herbst said.",
      "Another major concern is whether Putin, with his deep knowledge of Ukraine, could try to manipulate Mr. Trump, said former intelligence official Andrea Kendall-Taylor, who specialized in Russian affairs.",
      "Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova told CBS News that \"we all understand the reality on the ground, and we are ready to discuss how to end this war.\" She added, \"Let's stop the killings, and let's get to diplomacy.\"",
      "Ukraine and Russia's troubled history",
      "Ukraine was a part of the Soviet Union before voting for independence in 1991.",
      "After the Soviet Union collapsed, the NATO alliance expanded eastward, adding former Soviet republics including Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, and it established a close partnership with Ukraine. In 2008, the alliance declared its intention for Ukraine to join NATO at some point in the future.",
      "Putin has said on numerous occasions that he views NATO's expansion as a threat to Russia. He has also said that he believes Ukraine to be part of Russia politically, culturally and linguistically.",
      "Some Ukrainians, primarily in eastern areas, are Russian-speaking and feel more closely aligned with Russia than the nation of Ukraine. But the majority of Ukrainians speak Ukrainian, feel a deep patriotic connection to Ukraine and have favored developing closer ties to Europe.",
      "Widespread protests erupted in Ukraine in 2014 when the pro-Russian president at the time refused to sign an EU association agreement. The public outrage forced him from office \u2014 an apparent victory for Ukrainians who favored closer ties to Europe. But shortly after, Russia annexed Crimea, a peninsula that was internationally recognized as part of Ukraine, and the Kremlin supported a pro-Russian separatist rebellion in Ukraine's east.",
      "In 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, attacking cities across the country, including the capital, Kyiv. Some expected Russia to quickly take over, but Ukrainians fought hard to defend themselves, Russian gains largely stagnated behind front lines in the east, and the war has raged on ever since.",

      "Days before the summit\u00a0between the leaders of Russia and the U.S. in Alaska, Moscow's forces breached Ukrainian lines in a series of infiltrations in the country's industrial heartland of Donetsk. Though the advances amount to only a limited success for Russia since it still needs to consolidate its gains before achieving a true breakthrough, analysts say, it's a potentially dangerous moment for Ukraine.",
      "President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin will hold their high-stakes discussion about the war in Ukraine in Alaska on Friday. At the same time, Ukraine will be watching from the outside along with with European allies, hoping Mr. Trump is protecting their interests.",
      "Putin will likely try to persuade\u00a0Mr. Trump to pressure Ukraine by arguing the war is going badly for Kyiv, said Mykola Bieleskov, a senior analyst at CBA Initiatives Center.",
      "\"The key risk for Ukraine is that the Kremlin will try to turn certain local gains on the battlefield into strategic victories at the negotiating table,\" he said.",
      "Asked about Russia's continued military offensive as he headed to Alaska Friday morning, Mr. Trump said Putin is \"trying to set a stage. I mean, in his mind, that helps him make a better deal. It actually hurts him, but in his mind, that helps him make a better deal, if they can continue the killing.\"",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday that Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw from the remaining 30% of the Donetsk region that Kyiv still controls as part of a ceasefire deal, a proposal the Ukrainian leader categorically rejected.",
      "After years of fighting, Russia still does not fully control all of the Donetsk region, which it illegally annexed in 2022, along with the Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions.",
      "Attention has been focused on Pokrovsk \u2014 a key highway and rail junction that once was home to about 60,000 and now is partially encircled \u2014 but Russian forces have been probing for weaknesses north of the city, according to battlefield analysis site DeepState. The forces found a gap east of the coal-mining town of Dobropillia and advanced about 6 miles.",
      "Zelenskyy noted its clear significance to the summit: \"To create a certain information backdrop ahead of Putin's meeting with Trump, especially in the American information space, suggesting that Russia is moving forward and Ukraine is losing ground.\"",
      "Russia trying to expand its gains",
      "Small groups of Russian troops are slipping past the first defensive line, hiding and trying to build up their forces, said Dmytro Trehubov, spokesman for Ukraine's \"Dnipro\" operational-strategic group.",
      "Ukraine's military has been repelling these attempts, he said, although DeepState said the situation has not been stabilized.",
      "Analysts described the breach near Dobropillia as a localized crisis that could escalate if the Russians are not neutralized and their main forces can widen the gap.",
      "The breach of the defensive line has seemed inevitable for months, according to a drone pilot in the area, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk publicly. Moscow's forces have been exploiting the lack of Ukrainian infantry, a problem tied not only to the country's stalled mobilization but also to poor management, the pilot said.",
      "\"We pay with territory and lives to fix mistakes \u2014 and we can keep fixing mistakes only as long as we have even a scrap of land left,\" the pilot said.",
      "Ukrainian forces have tried to plug the gaps by extensive use of first-person-view drones \u2014 remotely piloted devices loaded with explosives that enable operators to see targets before striking.",
      "These FPVs have turned areas up to about 12 miles from the front into deadly zones on both sides of the line. But because the Russians attack with small groups, it's hard to counter with drones alone.",
      "\"We can't launch 100 FPVs at once,\" the pilot said, noting the drone operators would interfere with each other.",
      "With tactics and technology roughly equal on both sides, the Russians' superior manpower works to their advantage, said Bielieskov, the Kyiv-based analyst.",
      "\"They have no regard for human life. Very often, most of those they send are on a one-way mission,\" he said.",
      "Stopping the infiltrations and assaults by armored vehicles requires different defenses and leadership structures \u2014 changes that have yet to appear on Ukraine's side, he said.",
      "Ukraine seeking to stem the recent tide",
      "Ukraine's military said Thursday additional troops have been moved to affected areas, with battle-hardened forces like the Azov brigade being deployed to the sector. However, the Deepstate map doesn't show any changes in favor of the Ukrainian army.",
      "Michael Kofman, a military analyst for the Carnegie Endowment, said in a post on X that it was too early to assess if the front line was collapsing.",
      "Russia is focused on expanding the breach of the front line into a corridor to support its ground forces, Bieleskov said. The strategy avoids direct assaults on heavily fortified urban centers, instead pushing through open terrain where Ukraine's troop shortages and large settlements make defense harder.",
      "If successful, such a move could bypass Russia's need to storm Kostiantynivka \u2014 once a city of over 67,000 people and now significantly ruined and on the verge of falling. That would complicate defending the region's last big cities of Sloviansk, Kramatorsk and Druzhkivka, posing a serious challenge for Ukraine's military.",
      "Cmdr. Serhii Filimonov of the \"Da Vinci Wolves\" battalion of the 59th brigade warned that Kostiantynivka could fall without a fight if Russia severs supply routes.",
      "With few major roads, maintaining logistics for the large number of Ukrainian forces in the area would become \"extremely difficult,\" Filimonov said.",
      "Turning to the summit, Filimonov decried what he described as ongoing Russian killings and atrocities. \"And then the civilized world comes to them and says, 'Fine, let's make a deal.' That's not how it should be done,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "More than 30 shipwrecks have been discovered hidden in a lake in Germany, officials announced this week, including one vessel believed to be a steamer that was destroyed by an air raid in World War II.",
      "The ships were uncovered on the floor of Lake Constance during a project launched in 2022 called \"Wrecks and Deep Sea,\" according to the State Office for Monument Preservation. The office said scientists have dispatched divers and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) to discover a wide array of vessels \u2014 from century-old paddle steamers to a fully intact cargo sailing ship.",
      "Scientists had identified more than 250 potential anomalies in Lake Constance, which is up to 800 feet deep. Of these, 31 locations were determined to be wrecks, \"including both objects of cultural and historical significance as well as modern recreational boats and watercraft of recent times,\" the State Office for Monument Preservation said in a news release.",
      "Among the notable discoveries were two large metal ship hulls, which were discovered and surveyed using ROVs. Based on their size, characteristics and location, researchers believe these wrecks are the hulls of two paddle steamers \u2014 SD Baden and the SD Friedrichshafen II. According to the archeology site Arkeonews, the Friedrichshafen II was destroyed by an air raid during World War II, while the Baden was decommissioned in 1930 and eventually sunk. Both ships could carry up to 600 passengers.",
      "Images show the handwheel of the Friedrichshafen as well as the hulls and bows of both ships lying on the lake floor shrouded by marine life.",
      "Researchers also announced another \"special discovery\" \u2014 a nearly fully intact cargo sailing ship with its mast and yardarm preserved. The team did not estimate how old the vessel is but noted that its excellent condition is a \"rarity in underwater archaeology\" considering its depth and age. Experts noted that because the growth of invasive quagga mussels has been sparse, scientists were able to clearly view the ship's intricate details, including clamps in the bow, mooring pins and a gear ring with a ratchet.",
      "\"The find offers unique insights into the sailing technology and shipbuilding of historic Lake Constance ships and represents an important reference object for research,\" said Alexandra Ulisch, a scientific associate on the project.",
      "The project marked the first detailed investigation of the Lake Constance bed to identify underwater monuments, officials said.",
      "To complete the mission, scientists first analyzed data from bathymetry, which is the topographical surveying of water, using multibeam echo sounders. After that, researchers used side-scan sonar to examine anomalies that were detected underwater. After the sonar inspection, divers and ROVs examined potential locations of interest, which resulted in the discovery of the 31 shipwrecks.",
      "The team conducted detailed analyses of objects deemed \"cultural monuments\" but researchers said there was no plan to salvage individual objects, a process that is costly. The focus, researchers said, is on preserving the documentary value.",
      "\"Wrecks are much more than just lost vehicles \u2014 they are real time capsules that preserve the stories and craftsmanship of days long past,\" Ulisch said.",

    "story": [
      "Forecasters say\u00a0Tropical Storm Erin, which formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean on Monday, is on the verge of becoming the Atlantic season's first hurricane.",
      "The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said that as of 8 a.m. Friday, Erin was packing maximum sustained winds of 70 mph. Once they hit 74 mph, Erin will be classified as a hurricane. Its center was some 520 miles east of the northern Leeward Islands and was moving west-northwest at 17 mph, the center said.",
      "\"Steady strengthening is expected during the next few days and Erin is forecast to become a hurricane later today and could become a major hurricane by this weekend,\" the center said. A major hurricane is defined as a Category 3 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of at least 111 mph.",
      "Thursday evening, the center said Erin would likely become \"large and formidable.\"",
      "Erin doesn't appear to pose a direct threat to the U.S.",
      "The storm formed just west of the Cabo Verde islands, off the western coast of Africa, before moving west, the center said.",
      "Maps show Tropical Storm Erin's projected path",
      "The center of the storm is likely to move near or just north of the northern Leewards over the weekend, the hurricane center said.",
      "The northern Leewards are a string of islands stretching from the Virgin Islands to Guadeloupe, including Anguilla, St. Martin, St. Barts, Antigua and Barbuda, and several others.",
      "Drone video footage posted to\u00a0social media\u00a0showed the aftermath of flooding from the storm in Cabo Verde, a group of islands about 385 miles off the African coast. Local media reported at least eight people were killed, and officials declared a state of emergency as crews dealt with the damage.",
      "There's uncertainty about where Erin goes after this week, but most models show the storm pivoting to the northwest and north, CBS News Miami meteorologist Shane Hinton reported.",
      "Erin is the fifth named storm to develop during the Atlantic hurricane season, which started just over two months ago. Last week, Tropical Storm Dexter formed in the western Atlantic but didn't pose a threat to land. In early July, Tropical Storm Chantal made landfall on the Carolina coast, bringing deadly flooding to the region.",
      "The Atlantic hurricane season started in June and runs through November, with its peak months being August, September and October.",
      "The Pacific Ocean has already seen six hurricanes this year, including Henriette, which weakened to a tropical storm Tuesday and was not expected to hit land.",
      "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, predicted an above-normal season for the Atlantic basin this year, with an expected number of named storms between 13 and 18, five to nine of which could become hurricanes.",
      "A tropical cyclone becomes a tropical storm when its maximum sustained wind speeds reach at least 39 mph. Hurricanes are more powerful with sustained winds of at least 74 mph.

      "The number of brown bears in Hokkaido fell year-on-year in 2023 for the first time since 1991, according to estimates released this month.",
      "There were about 11,600 at the end of 2023, down 500 from a year earlier.",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Aug 2025 06:38:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A car accident, a series of secret wiretaps, a shootout with police and a drug bust eventually led federal investigators back to cartel leaders in Mexico.",
    "story": [
      "The investigation began years ago after two drug dealers got into a car accident in a small Tennessee town. What followed was a series of secret wiretaps, a shootout with police and the discovery of drugs hidden in a tractor trailer that would eventually lead federal investigators back to cartel leaders in Mexico.",
      "The investigation culminated with Justice Department indictments unsealed Thursday against three leaders and two high-ranking enforcers of the United Cartels, a leading rival of Jalisco New Generation Cartel.",
      "The U.S. government is offering a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to the arrest of United Cartels' top leader, Juan Jos\u00e9 Far\u00edas \u00c1lvarez \u2014 \"El Abuelo,\" or the grandfather \u2014 along with multimillion-dollar rewards for the four others. All five are believed to be in Mexico.",
      "The cases, as outlined in court documents, provide a glimpse into how drugs produced by violent cartels in large labs in Mexico flow across the U.S. border and reach American streets. They also highlight the violent fallout that drug trafficking leaves in its path from the mountains of Mexico to small U.S. towns.",
      "\"These cases in particular serve as a powerful reminder of the insidious impacts that global cartels can have on our local American communities,\" Matthew Galeotti, acting assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's criminal division said in an interview with The Associated Press. \"The chain started with a violent cartel in Mexico and it ended with law enforcement being shot at in a small town.\"",
      "United Cartels is an umbrella organization made up of smaller cartels that have worked for different groups over time. It holds a fierce grip over the western state of Michoacan, Mexico, an area of economic interest to the United States because of its avocado exports.",
      "United Cartels is not as widely known as Jalisco New Generation, but given its role as a prolific methamphetamine producer, it has become a top tier target for U.S. law enforcement. It was one of eight groups recently named foreign terrorist organizations by the Trump administration.",
      "The case goes back to 2019, when two dealers got into a car accident near Rockwood, Tennessee, outside of Knoxville, according to a search warrant affidavit filed in court. While fleeing the scene of the crash, they threw a hardened protective case filled with meth behind a building before being caught by police, according to court documents.",
      "Authorities began investigating, using wiretaps, search warrants and surveillance to identify a man believed to be leading a major drug ring in the Atlanta area: Eladio Mendoza.",
      "The investigation into Mendoza's suspected drug operation led law enforcement in early 2020 to a hotel near Atlanta. During their surveillance, authorities spotted a man leaving with a large Doritos bag. Troopers tried to stop the man after he drove from Georgia into Tennessee but he fled and fired an AK-style rifle at officers, hitting one in the leg before another trooper shot him. Inside the bag, police found meth and heroin, and identified him as a low-level dealer for Mendoza's drug ring, court records say.",
      "Weeks later, authorities searched properties linked to Mendoza and seized phones. They discovered messages between Mendoza and a close associate of \"El Abuelo,\" the leader of United Cartels, that showed the drugs were coming from Mexico, according to the court records. On one of Mendoza's properties, investigators found a tractor trailer that had crossed from Mexico days earlier. When they searched it, authorities seized 850 kilograms of meth hidden in the floor of the truck and discovered more drugs inside a bus and a home on the property, court papers say.",
      "Mendoza fled the U.S. a short time later and returned to Mexico, where he was killed by cartel leaders angry that U.S. authorities had seized their cash and drugs, according to prosecutors.",
      "The Justice Department says United Cartels' drug distribution network spans the U.S., with hubs in Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, Kansas City, Sacramento, Los Angeles, Denver and Chicago. Federal prosecutors allege profits from drug sales in the U.S. are \"allegedly used to acquire heavy weaponry, hire mercenaries, bribe local officials, and fund lavish lifestyles for cartel leaders.\"",
      "The case represents the latest effort by the Republican administration to turn up the pressure on cartels through not only indictments of the groups' leaders but sanctions targeting their financial network. The Treasury Department is also bringing economic sanctions against the five defendants as well as the United Cartels as a group and a cartel under its umbrella, Los Viagras.",
      "\"We have to pursue these criminals up and down the chain to make sure that the end result doesn't result in violence and narcotics distribution on our streets,\" Galeotti said.",
      "In addition to \"El Abuelo,\" those facing U.S. indictments are Alfonso Fern\u00e1ndez Magall\u00f3n, or Poncho, and Nicol\u00e1s Sierra Santana or \"El Gordo,\" who authorities say lead smaller cartels under the United Cartels organization. The two other defendants are Edgar Orozco Cabadas or \"El Kamoni,\" who was communicating with Mendoza, and Luis Enrique Barrag\u00e1n Chavaz, or \"Wicho,\" who serves as Magall\u00f3n second-in-command, according to authorities.",
      "Enough violence. Enough fear. The years of violence and methamphetamine trafficking caused by C\u00e1rteles Unidos in Mexico must stop\u2014now. pic.twitter.com/osjMc57QZF",
      "The Trump administration has seen major cooperation from Mexico in recent months in turning over cartel leaders wanted by U.S. authorities.",
      "In February, Mexico sent the U.S. 29 drug cartel figures, including drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero, who was behind the killing of a U.S. DEA agent in 1985, to the U.S. And on Tuesday, the Mexican government transferred to American custody 26 additional cartel leaders and other high-ranking members, including a man charged in connection to the killing of a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy.",
      "\"We're working with the Mexican authorities to pursue these individuals,\" Galeotti said. \"We continue to work proactively with them, and we expect that they'll be helpful with us in securing the presence of these individuals in United States courtrooms.\"",

      "Geneva \u2014 Negotiators working on a landmark treaty to address the global crisis of plastic pollution failed to reach an agreement during talks that extended into Friday in Geneva.",
      "Nations were meeting for an 11th day at the United Nations offices there to try to complete a treaty to end the plastic pollution crisis. They remain deadlocked over whether the treaty should reduce exponential growth of plastic production and put global, legally binding controls on toxic chemicals used to make plastics. Some 1,400 delegates took part in the talks.",
      "The negotiations at the U.N. hub were supposed to be the last round and produce the first legally binding treaty on plastic pollution, including in the oceans. But just like at the meeting in South Korea last year, they're leaving without a treaty.",
      "The biggest issue of the talks has been whether the treaty should impose caps on producing new plastic or focus instead on things like better design, recycling and reuse.",
      "Powerful oil- and gas-producing nations and the plastics industry oppose production limits. They want a treaty focused on better waste management and reuse.",
      "Every year, the world makes more than 400 million tons of new plastic, and that could grow by about 70% by 2040 without policy changes. About 100 countries want to limit production. Many have said it's also essential to address toxic chemicals used to make plastics.",
      "Thursday was the last scheduled day of negotiations, but work continued into Friday.",
      "Luis Vayas Valdivieso, the chair of the negotiating committee, wrote and presented two drafts of treaty text in Geneva based on the views expressed by the nations. The representatives from 183 countries didn't agree to use either one as the basis for their negotiations.",
      "Valdivieso said Friday morning as the delegates reconvened in the assembly hall that no further action is being proposed on the latest draft.",
      "After a three-hour session, he banged a gavel made of recycled plastic bottle tops from a Nairobi landfill and said the meeting was adjourned, to be resumed at a later date.",
      "Inger Andersen, executive director of the United Nations Environment Program, said despite challenges, despite the disappointment, \"we have to accept that significant progress was made.\"",
      "This process won't stop, she said, but it's too soon to say how long it will take to get a treaty now.",
      "Representatives of Norway, Australia, Tuvalu and others nations said they were deeply disappointed to be leaving Geneva without a treaty.",
      "European Commissioner Jessika Roswall said the European Union and its member states had higher expectations for this meeting and while the latest draft falls short on their demands, it's a good basis for another negotiating session.",
      "\"The Earth is not ours only. We are stewards for those who come after us. Let us fulfill that duty,\" she said.",
      "China's delegation said the fight against plastic pollution is a long marathon and that this temporary setback is a new starting point to forge consensus. It urged nations to work together to offer future generations a blue planet without plastic pollution.",
      "Saudi Arabia said both drafts lacked balance, and Saudi and Kuwaiti negotiators said the latest proposal takes other states' views more into account and addressed plastic production, which they consider outside the scope of the treaty.",
      "That draft, released early Friday, didn't include a limit on plastic production, but recognized that current levels of production and consumption are \"unsustainable\" and global action is needed. New language had been added to say these levels exceed current waste management capacities and are projected to increase further, \"thereby necessitating a coordinated global response to halt and reverse such trends.\"",
      "The objective of the treaty was also revamped to state that the accord would be based on a comprehensive approach that addresses the full lifecycle of plastics.",
      "Science shows what it will take to end pollution and protect human health, said Bethanie Carney Almroth, an ecotoxicology professor at Sweden's University of Gothenburg who coleads the Scientists' Coalition for an Effective Plastics Treaty. The science supports addressing the full lifecycle of plastics, beginning with extraction and production, and restricting some chemicals to ensure plastics are safer and more sustainable, she added.",
      "\"The science has not changed,\" she said. \"It cannot be down negotiated.\"",
      "Environmentalists, waste pickers and Indigenous leaders and many business executives traveled to the talks to make their voices heard. Some used creative tactics, but are leaving disappointed. Indigenous leaders sought a treaty that recognizes their rights and knowledge.",
      "A report published in the Lancet medical journal the day before the Geneva talks began described plastic pollution \u00a0a \"grave, growing and under-recognized danger\" to health that is costing the world at least $1.5 trillion a year.",
      "The report compared plastic to air and lead pollution and said plastic pollution's impact on health\u00a0could be mitigated by laws and policies.",

      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer welcomed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to London on Thursday, a day before a critical U.S.-Russia summit in Alaska.",
      "\"Yesterday, together with all partners, today in a bilateral format, we discussed expectations from the meeting in Alaska and possible prospects,\" Zelenskyy said in a social media post after the meeting. \"We also discussed in detail security guarantees that can make peace truly sustainable if the United States still manages to pressure Russia to stop the killings and engage in real meaningful diplomacy. It is important that we can all work together within a coalition of those willing to achieve effective formats for security work.\"",
      "Zelenskyy's trip to the British capital came a day after he took part in virtual meetings from Berlin with President Trump and the leaders of several European countries. Those leaders said Mr. Trump had assured them he would make it a priority to try to achieve a ceasefire in Ukraine during his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday in Anchorage.",
      "Putin was holding a meeting in Russia on Thursday with members of Russia's leadership to prepare for the Alaska meeting. As part of that preparatory meeting, he said he wanted to discuss the negotiation process with Ukraine and how it was going.",
      "Putin also said he planned \"to talk about the stage we are at with the current American administration, which, as everyone knows, is making, in my opinion, quite energetic and sincere efforts to stop the fighting, stop the crisis and reach agreements that are of interest to all parties involved in this conflict.\"",
      "Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said Thursday that the Friday meeting between Mr. Trump and Putin in Alaska is expected to begin at around 11:30 a.m. local time on Friday. The main topic will be the war in Ukraine, but there will also be discussions about economic cooperation between Washington and Moscow.",
      "He said the meeting will take place at Elmendorf-Richardson Air Force Base, and that there will first be a one-on-one meeting between the two leaders before their delegations join.",
      "Mr. Trump and Putin will say a few words at the start of the meeting, Ushakov said, and they will hold a joint press conference afterward.",
      "Ushakov said each delegation will have five members. For Russia, those will be Ushakov, as well as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund Kirill Dmitriev, and Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov.",
      "Alaska summit \"hugely important\"",
      "Both Zelenskyy and the Europeans have worried the bilateral U.S.-Russia summit would leave them and their interests sidelined, and that any conclusions reached could favor Moscow and leave Ukraine and Europe's future security in jeopardy.",
      "Yet some of those leaders, like German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron, praised Wednesday's video conference with Mr. Trump as constructive.",
      "Speaking after the meetings to reporters, Mr. Trump warned of \"very severe consequences\" for Russia if Putin does not agree to stop the war against Ukraine after Friday's meeting.",
      "Starmer on Wednesday said the Alaska summit would be \"hugely important,\" and could be a \"viable\" path to a ceasefire in Ukraine. But he also alluded to European concerns that Mr. Trump may strike a deal that forces Ukraine to cede territory to Russia, and warned that Western allies must be prepared to step up pressure on Russia if necessary.",
      "During a call Wednesday among leaders of countries involved in the \"coalition of the willing\" \u2014 those who are prepared to help police any future peace agreement between Moscow and Kyiv \u2014 Starmer stressed that any deal reached on bringing the fighting to an end must protect the \"territorial integrity\" of Ukraine.",
      "\"International borders cannot be, and must not be changed by force,'' he said. \"Any talk about borders, diplomacy, ceasefire has to sit alongside a robust and credible security guarantee to ensure that any peace, if there is peace, is lasting peace and Ukraine can defend its territorial integrity as part of any deal.\"",
      "Kyiv has long insisted that safeguards against future Russian attacks provided by its Western allies would be a precondition for achieving a durable end to the fighting in Ukraine. Yet many Western governments have been hesitant to commit to engaging their military personnel.",
      "Countries in the \"coalition of the willing,\" which include France and the U.K., have been trying for months to secure U.S. security backing should it be required. Following Wednesday's virtual meetings, Macron said Mr. Trump told the assembled leaders that while the NATO military alliance must not be part of future security guarantees, the U.S. leader agreed that \"the United States and all the parties involved should take part.\"",
      "\"It's a very important clarification that we have received,\" Macron said.",
      "European Council President Antonio Costa also welcomed \"the readiness of the United States to share with Europe the efforts to reinforce security conditions once we obtain a durable and just peace for Ukraine.\"",
      "\"I don't see any changes coming\"",
      "With another high-level meeting on their country's future on the horizon, some Ukrainians expressed skepticism that any breakthroughs would be achieved during Friday's U.S.-Russia summit.",
      "Oleksandra Kozlova, 39, a department head at a digital agency in Kyiv, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that she believes Ukrainians \"have already lost hope\" that meaningful progress can be made on ending the 3 1/2-year-old war.",
      "\"I don't think this round will be decisive,\" she said. \"There have already been enough meetings and negotiations promising us, ordinary people, that something will be resolved, that things will get better, that the war will end. Unfortunately, this has not happened, so personally I don't see any changes coming.\"",
      "Anton Vyshniak, a car salesman in Kyiv, said Ukraine's priority now should be saving the lives of its military servicepeople, even at the expense of making territorial concessions.",
      "\"At the moment, the most important thing is to preserve the lives of male and female military personnel. After all, there are not many human resources left,\" he said. \"Borders are borders, but human lives are priceless. Therefore, some principles can be disregarded here.\"",
      "Russian strikes in Ukraine's Sumy region overnight Wednesday resulted in numerous injuries, Ukrainian regional officials said.

    "summary": "Israel's far-right finance minister announced approval of the construction of a contentious settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank that he says \"buries the idea of a Palestinian state.\"",
    "story": [
      "Israel's far-right finance minister announced approval Thursday of the construction of a contentious settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank that Palestinians and rights groups worry would scuttle plans for a future Palestinian state by effectively cutting the West Bank into two separate parts.",
      "The announcement comes as several major U.S. allies have announced plans to recognize a Palestinian state\u00a0in September.",
      "\"This reality finally buries the idea of a Palestinian state, because there is nothing to recognize and no one to recognize,\" said Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. \"Anyone in the world who tries today to recognize a Palestinian state \u2014 will receive an answer from us on the ground.\"",
      "Development in E1, an open tract of land east of Jerusalem, has been under consideration for more than two decades, but was frozen due to U.S. pressure during previous administrations. On Thursday, Smotrich praised President Trump and U.S. ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee as \"true friends of Israel as we have never had before.\"",
      "The E1 plan hasn't yet received its final approval, which is expected next week. The plan includes around 3,500 apartments to expand the settlement of Maale Adumim, Smotrich said. While some bureaucratic steps remain, if the process moves quickly, infrastructure work could begin in the next few months and construction of homes could start in around a year.",
      "Rights groups swiftly condemned the plan. Peace Now called it \"deadly for the future of Israel and for any chance of achieving a peaceful two-state solution\" that is \"guaranteeing many more years of bloodshed.\"",
      "The Palestinian foreign ministry called the plan an extension of crimes of what it says are genocide, displacement and annexation, the Reuters news agency reports. Israel fiercely denies those characterizations.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear if Netanyahu backs the E1 plan, Reuters said.",
      "Smotrich's popularity has dropped in recent months, Reuters notes, with polls showing his party wouldn't win a single seat if parliamentary elections were held today.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and leaders of numerous NATO countries held virtual meetings Wednesday ahead of Friday's scheduled summit in Alaska between Mr. Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Mr. Trump joined in a call from the White House. In a social media post ahead of the meeting, he wrote: \"Will be speaking to European Leaders in a short while. They are great people who want to see a deal done.\"",
      "The president on Wednesday said he hopes there will be a second meeting after the Alaska meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy, but that will depend on how Friday's sitdown goes. Asked by a reporter at an event at the Kennedy Center whether there will be consequences for Putin if he doesn't agree to stop the war after the Friday meeting, Mr. Trump said, \"There will be very severe consequences.\" But he declined to elaborate.",
      "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz convened the series of virtual meetings in an attempt to have the voice of European and Ukrainian leaders heard ahead of the Alaska summit, which they've been sidelined from.",
      "Zelenskyy joined Merz in Berlin, and they met with European leaders earlier Wednesday in preparation for the virtual call with Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance about an hour later.",
      "\"U.S. President Trump will start discussions with President Putin in Alaska about bringing the war to an end, and important decisions could be reached,\" Merz, standing alongside Zelenskyy, told journalists in a press conference after meeting with Mr. Trump. \"We as Europeans are doing everything we can to help set the agenda for that meeting. We're hoping that Donald Trump has success in that meeting in Anchorage.\"",
      "Merz said that he and Zelenskyy had spoken with Mr. Trump together.",
      "\"In Alaska, security interests of Europe and Ukraine must be protected. That is part of what we discussed with President Trump. We were together on the conditions of this meeting and the goals of this meeting on Friday,\" Merz said.",
      "The German leader said Ukraine would need a seat at the table if peace was to be reached in Ukraine, and that he told Mr. Trump he would speak to him after his Alaska meeting with Putin.",
      "\"We want to make sure that the right chronology happens: that there is a ceasefire and that there is an agreement that is discussed after that,\" he said. \"A legal recognition of Russian ownership of this territory cannot happen. There have to be robust security guarantees. The sovereignty of Ukraine has to be respected. Negotiations have to be part of a larger transatlantic strategy, and has to be part of necessary pressure on Russia.\"",
      "Merz added, \"If there is no movement on the Russian side, we and the U.S. have to put more pressure on Russia. President Trump knows this position and largely agrees with it, and we had a good conversation with each other.\"",
      "\"Everything ... needs to be discussed with Ukraine\"",
      "Zelenskyy thanked Merz and said \"everything regarding Ukraine needs to be discussed with Ukraine. We have to be part of this conversation.\" He said Ukraine, before anything else, needed a ceasefire and security guarantees.",
      "\"President Trump has supported us today, and the U.S. is ready to support us,\" he said.",
      "Zelenskyy also said he had told Mr. Trump and the European leaders that \"Putin is bluffing,\" and that \"Putin doesn't want peace. He wants to occupy our country, and we understand it. Putin cannot fool us. We need to pressure him. Sanctions not only from the U.S., but from the European Union. Together our union of partners can really, really stop Putin's war.\"",
      "He urged allies to keep up sanctions on Moscow, saying, \"Sanctions and increasing sanctions on Russia if they are not agreeing to a ceasefire \u2014 this is very effective and they are working.\"",
      "Regarding Friday's meeting in Alaska, Zelenskyy said he had discussed his priorities with Mr. Trump.",
      "\"We really hope that the immediate ceasefire will be one main issue during this meeting,\" Zelenskyy said. \"President Trump was talking about it. Then he suggested that he will contact me immediately after his Alaska meeting. He will tell me about all results, if there are any results, and then we will discuss our steps together.\"",
      "Earlier on Wednesday, Merz pledged to help Ukraine develop its own long-range missile systems that would be free of any Western-imposed limitations on their use and targets as the Kyiv government fights to repel Russia's invasion.",
      "Mr. Trump has said he wants to see whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is serious about ending the war, now in its fourth year, describing Friday's summit as \"a feel-out meeting\" where he can assess the Russian leader's intentions.",
      "Yet Mr. Trump has disappointed allies in Europe by saying Ukraine will have to give up some Russian-held territory. He has also said Russia must accept land swaps, although it was unclear what Putin might be expected to surrender.",
      "European allies have pushed for Ukraine's involvement in any peace talks, fearful that discussions that exclude Kyiv could otherwise favor Moscow.",
      "Mr. Trump on Monday ducked repeated chances to say that he would push for Zelenskyy to take part in his discussions with Putin, and was dismissive of Zelenskyy and his need to be part of an effort to seek peace. Mr. Trump said that following Friday's summit, a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian leaders could be arranged, or that it could also be a meeting with \"Putin and Zelenskyy and me.\"",
      "Zelenskyy warned that \"talks about us, without us, will not work.\"",
      "Ukrainian and European concerns",
      "The Europeans and Ukraine are wary that Putin, who has waged the biggest land war in Europe since 1945 and used Russia's energy might to try to intimidate the European Union, might secure favorable concessions and set the outlines of a peace deal without them.",
      "The overarching fear of many European countries is that Putin will set his sights on one of them next if he wins in Ukraine.",
      "Zelenskyy said Tuesday that Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw from the remaining 30% of the Donetsk region that it still controls as part of a ceasefire deal, a proposal the leader categorically rejected.",
      "Zelenskyy reiterated that Ukraine would not give up any territory it controls, saying that would be unconstitutional and would serve only as a springboard for a future Russian invasion.",
      "He said diplomatic discussions led by the U.S. focusing on ending the war have not addressed key Ukrainian demands, including security guarantees to prevent future Russian aggression and including Europe in negotiations and rehabilitate Putin.",
      "General Sir Richard Shirreff, former NATO Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe, told CBS News partner network BBC News he didn't believe Friday's meeting between Mr. Trump and Putin could lead to an end of the war between Russia and Ukraine.",
      "\"Russia has to recognize and Putin has to recognize that Zelenskyy is president of Ukraine, recognize the Ukrainian constitution and Ukraine's right to exist as a sovereign state. And that is only going to happen ... when Russia gets a really bloody nose. And for that to happen, we need to see some proper strategic thinking from NATO - from the president of the United States - that recognizes that this is about transatlantic security.\"",
      "Shirreff said an end to the war would require Ukraine becoming a member of NATO.",
      "\"Even if Putin moves on or falls under a bus, we're probably likely to get somebody in place just as hard-line, just as ultra-nationalistic, and just as determined to press on (with Russia's takeover of Ukraine),\" Shirreff said. \"So I think we have to recognize that European security means deterrence - a band of deterrent steel, as I've said many times - from the Baltic to the Black Sea, with Ukraine as a NATO member. Now, however far-fetched that may seem from where we are at the moment, that's the reality. ... Any sort of compromise now, any so-called freezing of conflict, is only going to continue to postpone it.\"",
      "Trump-Putin summit to take place on Alaskan military base",
      "The summit between Mr. Trump and Putin will be the first in-person meeting between Putin and a sitting U.S. president since Russia invaded Ukraine more than three years ago.",
      "The meeting will take place at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, on the northern edge of Anchorage, a senior White House official told CBS News Tuesday. Given that it is peak tourist season in Alaska, there were few viable options to host the talks. Possible venues for the high-stakes meeting also needed to meet security requirements.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier Tuesday that the mechanics of the meeting were \"still being ironed out.\"",
      "Leavitt described the meeting as \"a listening exercise for the president.\"",
      "\"Only one party that's involved in this war is going to be present, and so this is for the president to go and to get, again, a more firm and better understanding of how we can hopefully bring this war to an end,\" Leavitt said.",
      "\"Trump has obviously not been listening at all because it's very clear \u2014 and Putin continues to make it clear \u2014 what his demands are, and he's not stepped back one iota from his maximalist demands,\" former NATO Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe Shirreff said. \"And those, as we've heard, are simply impossible for Ukraine to accept without capitulation.\"",
      "Asked Wednesday at the Kennedy Center if he believes he can convince Putin to stop targeting Ukrainian civilians, Mr. Trump said no.",
      "\"Well, I'll tell you what,\" Mr. Trump responded. \"I've had that conversation with him. I've had a lot of good conversations with him. Then I go home and I see that a rocket hit a nursing home or a rocket hit an apartment building and people are laying dead in the streets. So I guess the answer to that is no, because I've had this conversation.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters in the White House briefing room Monday, Mr. Trump expressed optimism that his meeting with Putin will be \"constructive,\" and said that he is planning to establish an in-person meeting involving Putin and Zelenskyy.",
      "\"The next meeting will be with Zelenskyy and Putin or Zelenskyy and Putin and me,\" Mr. Trump said.",

      "Google Gemini app on a mobile device\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How Gemini summaries can be hacked",
      "Researchers at Mozilla's 0Din have discovered a vulnerability in Google's Gemini for Workspace that allows attackers to inject hidden instructions into email summaries. The issue, demonstrated by Marco Figueroa, shows how generative AI tools can be misled through indirect prompt injection. This technique embeds invisible commands inside the body of an email. When Gemini summarizes the message, it interprets and acts on those hidden prompts.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The attack does not rely on suspicious links or attachments. Instead, it uses a combination of HTML and CSS to conceal the prompt by setting the font size to zero and the color to white. These commands remain invisible in Gmail's standard view but are still accessible to Gemini. Once you request a summary, the AI can be tricked into presenting fake security alerts or urgent instructions that appear to come from Google.",
      "In a proof of concept, Gemini falsely warned a user that a Gmail password had been compromised and included a fake support phone number. Since Gemini summaries are integrated into Google Workspace, you are more likely to trust the information, making this tactic especially effective.",

      "In a statement, a Google spokesperson said, \"Defending against attacks impacting the industry, like prompt injections, has been a continued priority for us, and we've deployed numerous strong defenses to keep users safe, including safeguards to prevent harmful or misleading responses. We are constantly hardening our already robust defenses through red-teaming exercises that train our models to defend against these types of adversarial attacks.\"",

      "So, how can you protect yourself from phishing scams that exploit AI tools like Gemini? Here are six essential steps you can take right now to stay safe:",
      "Just because a summary appears in Gmail or Docs does not mean it is automatically safe. Treat AI-generated suggestions, alerts or links with the same caution you would any unsolicited message. Always verify critical information, such as security alerts or phone numbers, through official sources.",
      "If an email seems unusual, especially if it is unexpected or from someone you do not recognize, avoid using the AI summary feature. Instead, read the full email as it was originally written. This lowers the chance of falling for misleading summaries.",
      "Watch for emails or messages that create a sense of urgency, ask you to verify account details or provide unexpected links or contact information, even if they appear trustworthy or come from familiar sources. Attackers can use AI to craft realistic-looking alerts or requests for sensitive information, sometimes concealed within automatically generated summaries. So, always pause and scrutinize suspicious prompts before responding.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech",
      "Ensure that Google Workspace and your browser are always running the latest version. Google regularly releases security updates that help prevent newer types of attacks. Also, avoid using unofficial extensions that have access to your Gmail or Docs.",
      "AI-driven scams like the Gemini summary attack don't happen in a vacuum. They often begin with stolen personal information. That data might come from past breaches, public records or details you've unknowingly shared online. A data removal service can help by continuously scanning and requesting the removal of your information from data broker sites. While no service can wipe everything, reducing your digital footprint makes it harder for attackers to personalize phishing attempts or link you to known breach data. Think of it as one more layer of protection in a world where AI makes targeted scams even easier.",

Once inside, the AirTag becomes invisible and unnoticeable to the child wearing the shoes. From there, all tracking happens through Apple's Find My app, which works on any iPhone. It updates the tag's location as long as it remains near an Apple device. Since AirTags were made to track objects like keys and bags, slipping one into a shoe was just a matter of time.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",

      "Skechers designed these shoes with both practicality and peace of mind in mind. They feature an adaptive closure system with stretch laces and an adjustable instep strap, making it easy for kids to slip them on and off without help. Comfort isn't an afterthought either. Each pair includes a Skechers Air-Cooled Goga Mat insole with high-rebound cushioning, giving growing feet the support they need throughout the day. Plus, they're machine washable, which saves parents time and effort. The standout feature is the hidden AirTag-compatible compartment tucked beneath the heel of the insole. It comes with a screw-tight cover that keeps the tracker secure and discreet. There's no external AirTag branding, so the shoes look like any regular pair of Skechers. With a breathable mesh and synthetic upper, durable rubber outsole, and 1 1/4-inch heel height, the design delivers both style and function. They're available in sizes for boys and girls, and even without an AirTag, they work perfectly as everyday sneakers.",

If the tag moves out of range or its battery dies, the updates stop. Another issue? Anyone who has access to your Apple account can view the tag's location. While you can manage and revoke access in your iPhone settings, this means privacy depends on your own security habits. And yes, it's possible for someone to remove the battery and disable an AirTag in seconds. That means this shoe-tracking feature won't replace supervision; it's simply a backup.",

      "Skechers GO RUN Elevate 2.0 - Find My Skechers. (Skechers)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you're a parent looking for a low-cost way to track where your child's shoes are, this is a creative solution. It's less intrusive than giving them a phone and more flexible than a built-in GPS system. You control the tracker, you install the battery, and you decide who gets access. But don't confuse shoe tracking with child safety. These trainers can offer location updates, but they can't think, speak, or call for help. Think of them as one extra tool, not your only one.",

      "The new Repost feature lets you share public reels and feed posts directly with your followers. Your reposts appear both in their feeds and in a dedicated tab on your profile, making it easy to revisit your favorites.",
      "Creators benefit, too. When someone reposts your content, it can reach that person's followers, even if they don't follow you, opening the door to new audiences.",
      "To repost, tap the\u00a0repost icon, add an optional note, and\u00a0save. The post will credit the original creator so everyone knows where it came from.",

      "How scammers are targeting WhatsApp users",
      "Online scams no longer live on just one platform. Criminal operations often start with a text or dating app, move to WhatsApp, and finish on Telegram or a crypto exchange. In just one scheme, scammers may run a victim through five different apps to make the fraud harder to detect.",

      "In a recent takedown, WhatsApp and Meta partnered with OpenAI to shut down a scam operation linked to Cambodia.

Once trust was built, scammers asked for crypto deposits to unlock fake earnings.",

Scammers will always find new angles and often prey on the same people across multiple platforms. That's why it's smart to take extra steps beyond what WhatsApp offers. Here are five ways to add layers of protection:",
      "Scammers often try to trick you into clicking on links or downloading files that can compromise your device. A strong antivirus program can block these threats before they do harm. It can also alert you to phishing attempts disguised as WhatsApp messages. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "People wearing the TrueLimb, a 3D-printed prosthetic\u00a0 (Unlimited Tomorrow)",
      "How TrueLimb sets itself apart from other bionic arms",
      "TrueLimb is a full-arm prosthetic solution designed to feel more like an extension of the body than a mechanical device. Each arm is personalized to match the user's opposing limb, down to fingertip size and skin tone. A wide range of color options are available, including natural shades, jet black and metallic silver.",
      "Instead of relying on standard sizes, TrueLimb is custom-built using a remote 3D scanning system. This digital process eliminates the need for in-person fittings and allows for precise, individualized design. The socket is breathable, adjustable and crafted for all-day wear. A built-in BOA dial lets users fine-tune the fit with ease. At just 1.0 to 1.5 pounds from socket to fingertip, the prosthetic remains lightweight and comfortable.",
      "TrueLimb, a 3D-printed prosthetic\u00a0 (Unlimited Tomorrow)",
      "Smart sensors power intuitive, muscle-based control",
      "TrueLimb features TrueSense technology, which includes over 30 topographical sensors embedded within the socket. These sensors detect subtle muscle movements on the residual limb, delivering accurate and responsive control, even when the limb is covered or sweating.",
      "While often referred to as \"mind-controlled,\" TrueLimb does not read brain signals directly. Instead, it uses advanced sensors to pick up electrical activity from muscles in the residual limb. These signals reflect the user\u2019s intended movements, allowing the prosthetic to respond in real time, creating a seamless, intuitive experience that feels like second nature.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The system adapts automatically by identifying the most active myo sites, deactivating less useful sensors and fine-tuning responsiveness based on the user's signal strength. This ensures consistent performance, even if muscle activity changes over time.",
      "The prosthetic includes six intuitive grip patterns to support a wide range of daily activities. Independent finger joints allow the hand to wrap around objects naturally, offering both strength and flexibility. The device is precise enough to handle delicate tasks, such as lifting an egg without cracking it.",
      "TrueLimb, a 3D-printed prosthetic\u00a0 (Unlimited Tomorrow)",
      "Feel touch again with haptic feedback technology",
      "Beyond movement, TrueLimb gives the user back a sense of touch. Gentle vibrations provide feedback when the prosthetic hand makes contact with objects. This helps users operate the device without always needing to look down, making actions more fluid and natural. The thumb is manually opposable, giving the user better control over grip force and object handling. Whether opening a bottle or holding a pen, the motion feels smooth and confident.",
      "Built for daily life with durable, lightweight materials",
      "TrueLimb is made with PA12 nylon, a highly durable material used in industrial-grade applications. The entire arm is built to withstand daily life. It's splash-resistant, heat-resistant, stain-resistant and tough enough to handle impact or abrasion. Thanks to its rubberized palm and coated fingertips, the hand maintains a firm grip on smooth or slippery surfaces. And with bionic strength, it can lift objects up to 15 pounds with ease.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Fast charging and multi-day battery life",
      "Power won't hold the user back. TrueLimb uses a USB-C charger, the same kind used for most phones and laptops, so no special adapter is needed. A high-capacity 5600mAh battery provides multi-day life, giving freedom to move without frequent recharges. The device also receives over-the-air software updates, so performance improves over time without needing to return the device. Behind the scenes, analytics tools help optimize each arm's performance based on how it's being used.",
      "How TrueLimb is designed and delivered from home",
      "One of the most innovative parts of the TrueLimb process is how it reaches users. Everything happens remotely. Users receive a 3D scanner in the mail to capture the shape of their limb. The data goes directly to the Unlimited Tomorrow team, which builds the prosthetic in-house. This approach eliminates middlemen and dramatically speeds up delivery. Users typically receive their completed prosthetic within weeks.",
      "TrueLimb is pictured in the box in which it was delivered. (Unlimited Tomorrow)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you or a loved one needs a prosthetic arm, this technology changes everything. You no longer need to wait months, file insurance claims or attend repeated fittings. With TrueLimb, you get a high-tech, customized solution faster and at a lower cost. You also gain full control and comfort. The sensors respond to your muscle signals without any lag. The arm fits your body, looks natural and feels like part of you.",

      "The indictment alleges that \"during shifts Vappie claimed to be on duty for EPU, he frequently spent time inside the Pontalba Apartment both with Cantrell and alone.\" Federal prosecutors say this was part of a broader scheme to conceal the pair\u2019s personal relationship while billing the city for on-duty hours. Around the same time, Vappie\u2019s wife filed for divorce, citing the alleged relationship in court filings, according to local reports.",
      "A unit in the Pontalba Apartments, a historic city-owned property in the French Quarter, has long been considered a ceremonial perk of the mayor\u2019s office, used to host visiting dignitaries, Mardi Gras festivities and other official functions, not as a permanent residence.",
      "The indictment also details personal messages the pair allegedly exchanged via WhatsApp, including a June 11, 2022, photo Cantrell sent to Vappie of a ring on her finger with the caption, \"Hey did you tell [them] you put a ring on it?\". In another message, Cantrell allegedly wrote, \"The times when we are truly alone (traveling) is what spoils me the most\".",
      "Prosecutors further allege Cantrell tried to cover up the relationship by deleting messages, activating a setting to make them disappear within 24 hours and lying under oath to a federal grand jury about turning over all requested evidence, withholding more than 50 photos from her personal devices.",
      "Mayor Cantrell is no stranger to controversy after weathering a failed recall effort in 2022 organized by New Orleanians, including a former staffer of hers. (Ethan Miller/Getty Images)",
      "Cantrell\u2019s tenure had already been marked by public controversy, most recently over a French Quarter trash dispute. She terminated IV Waste\u2019s sanitation contract, widely praised for its cleaning services, in favor of a personally-connected firm via an emergency declaration, sparking backlash from City Council officials and a filing from the Louisiana Attorney General condemning the move as an \"abuse of emergency powers.\"",
      "Cantrell, first elected in 2017 and re-elected in 2021, has previously faced multiple ethics complaints. Her indictment could significantly alter the city\u2019s political landscape ahead of the October 2025 mayoral race. City Councilwoman Helena Moreno is widely considered the frontrunner. Fox News Digital has reached out to Moreno for comment but has not yet received a response.",
      "In an unrelated 2022 incident, Mayor Cantrell made headlines when she stepped into a physical altercation in a ladies\u2019 room at a Rob49 rap concert at the Fillmore NOLA. Footage showed her diffusing a tense standoff; her communications director at the time praised her for intervening, calling it living her motto: \"if you see something, do something.\"",
      "Also in 2022, activist and former Cantrell staffer Eileen Carter and community figure Belden \"Noonie Man\" Batiste launched a recall campaign claiming the mayor had \"failed to put New\u202fOrleans first and execute the responsibilities of the position.\" Despite submitting tens of thousands of signatures, organizers fell well short. According to Ballotpedia, about 67,000 signatures were submitted, but only 27,243 were validated, far below the nearly 45,000 required for triggering a recall election.",
      "Cantrell, the first female mayor in the city\u2019s more than 300-year history, is now its first sitting mayor to face criminal charges.",
      "If found guilty, the potential maximum penalties are up to five years for conspiracy to commit wire fraud; up to 20 years per count for wire fraud; up to 20 years for conspiracy to obstruct justice; up to five years for Vappie\u2019s false-statement charge; up to 20 years for Cantrell\u2019s obstruction charge; and up to five years per count for Cantrell\u2019s false-declaration charges.",

      "DeSantis said the facility, which has been dormant since 2021, will build on the success of Alligator Alcatraz in the Everglades and is expected to be operational in two to three weeks with staffing by the Florida National Guard and state contractors.",
      "\"There\u2019s a massive part here at Baker Correctional that\u2019s vacant and isn\u2019t being used for any state correction activity,\" DeSantis said at a press briefing. \"Talk about ready-made infrastructure, this is something that\u2019s very appealing from that perspective.\"",
      "DeSantis touted the relative ease and economy of setting up the northern Florida facility, estimating the build-out cost to be $6 million. That\u2019s compared to the\u00a0hundreds of millions of dollars\u00a0the state has committed to constructing the\u00a0vast network of tents and trailers\u00a0at the south facility in the rugged and remote Florida swamp.",
      "\"This part of the facility is not being used right now for the state prisoners. It just gives us an ability to go in, stand it up quickly, stand it up cheaply,\" DeSantis said of the state prison, calling the site \"ready-made.\"",
      "The new facility is being built as part of the Trump administration\u2019s effort to deport the millions of migrants who flooded the country under the Biden administration.",
      "DeSantis said that there are an estimated 50,000 to 100,000 illegal immigrants in Florida who already have final orders of removal but have not yet been deported.\u00a0He touted state and local law enforcement agencies' participation in ICE operations with the latest move expanding Florida's 287(g) program, where state officers collaborate with ICE.",

      "DeSantis had previously floated plans to open a second detention facility at a nearby Florida National Guard training facility known as Camp Blanding, about 30 miles southwest of Jacksonville. The long-standing military installation was a major U.S. Army training facility during World War II and serves as a \"continuity of government\" site for Florida\u2019s executive branch, according to the facility\u2019s website.",

      "\"Blanding does have air capacity, but probably not a big enough runway to handle large planes,\" DeSantis said.",

      "At issue were two Education Department memos issued earlier this year that threatened to withhold combined billions of dollars of funding from schools who failed to wind down their DEI programs, a key issue for the department in Trump's second term. Those efforts sparked a flurry of federal lawsuits and requests for emergency relief earlier this year.",
      "In a sharp, 76-page ruling \u00a0Thursday, U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher said that that the Trump administration's efforts to slash funding from educational institutions that kept in place with DEI initiatives ran afoul of the Administrative Procedures Act, and risked threatening free speech protections under the First Amendment.",

      "While the ruling itself is unlikely to change anything in the near-term, as the anti-DEI push in question had already been temporarily paused by several federal courts earlier this year, Gallagher's ruling officially ruled that the Education Department's efforts were illegal, and ordered the administration to reverse course.",

This time, however, Bell did not answer.",

    "story": [
      "More children died from the flu this past season than any year outside of the swine flu pandemic in 2009. Most of them were unvaccinated.",
      "That's why some doctors are hoping that the first nasal flu vaccine available for use at home can improve vaccination rates among people, especially children, who are afraid of needles.",
      "AstraZeneca's FluMist Home, which was approved last fall, is now available with a prescription for children ages 2 and over, and adults up to age 49.",
      "A 2019 review from researchers at the University of Michigan found the majority of children and up to 30% of young adults are afraid of needles.",
      "Dr. Zachary Hoy, board-certified pediatric infectious disease specialist at Pediatrix Medical Group in Nashville, Tennessee, said many children are scared because they aren't old enough to understand what vaccines are and why they are important.",
      "\u201cMost of the time, the anxiety and worry before the shot is scarier than the actual shot,\u201d Hoy said.",
      "How does FluMist Home work?",
      "The vaccine was first approved in 2003 to be given in a doctor's office. However, after the 2009 swine flu pandemic introduced the new H1N1 strain, several studies found the nasal spray was less effective than other flu vaccines. This prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to recommend against using the nasal spray in 2016. At the time, the CDC said the nasal spray accounted for one-third of all flu vaccines given to children.",
      "In response, FluMist\u2019s manufacturers reformulated it to more closely match circulating strains, including H1N1, and the nasal spray returned in 2018. Like injectable flu vaccines, FluMist is updated each season based on recommendations from global health officials.",
      "\u201cFluMist\u2019s efficacy is comparable to injectable flu vaccines and is a safe and effective needle-free option for flu protection,\u201d AstraZeneca spokesperson Andrew Leone said.",
      "Experts say it\u2019s too early to tell how bad the upcoming flu season will be.",
      "Typically, flu vaccines are 40% and 60% effective in preventing severe illness, and FluMist Home should be equally protective. The doses for the 2026-2027 season contain three virus strains: an A/H1N1 strain, an A/H3N2 strain and a B strain from the B/Victoria lineage, according to the drugmaker.",
      "The FluMist Home vaccine contains a weakened form of a live virus to stimulate the immune system. Pregnant women or people with compromised immune systems are advised to talk with their doctor before using it.",
      "Does insurance cover it?",
      "FluMist Home is available only online. People ordering the nasal spray will need to complete a medical screening questionnaire at FluMist.com that is reviewed by a health care professional, according to the drugmaker. FluMist Home\u2019s online pharmacy will then collect the insurance information and bill the health plan directly.",
      "A temperature monitor on the packaging will verify that the vaccine has been maintained at the appropriate temperature during shipping and delivery. Green means it's safe to use. Red means it's not.",
      "Christina Aungst, senior pharmacy editor at GoodRx, estimates people with insurance will likely only have to pay an $8.99 shipping fee for the nasal spray.",
      "\u201cCurrently, if you don\u2019t have insurance, FluMist is only available in a health care setting,\u201d AstraZeneca's Leone said. \u201cWe hope to provide a cash pay option for FluMist Home in future seasons.\u201d",
      "When FluMist is given in a health care office or clinic, most insurance plans \u2014 including Medicare and Medicaid \u2014 will cover it.",
      "Dr. Scott Roberts, associate medical director of infection prevention at Yale School of Medicine, worries people may not administer the nasal spray vaccine properly without a doctor's supervision.",
      "\u201cWhat if they have a runny nose? How far back do they need to spray in the nose? What if they store it incorrectly in their house?\u201d Roberts asked.",
      "Dr. Kristina Bryant, pediatric infectious diseases physician at Norton Children\u2019s in Louisville, Kentucky, and a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases, said the bottom line is that all the available flu vaccines offer comparable protection.",
      "\u201cThe most important thing to know is that vaccines only work if they are actually administered,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cHopefully, the availability of a vaccine that can be administered in the home will make it easier for some people to be protected against flu.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Rapper Sean Kingston was sentenced to three and a half years in federal prison and three years of supervised release on Friday after a jury found him and his mother guilty of wire fraud earlier this year.",
      "Kingston, whose real name is Kisean Anderson, and his mother, Janice Turner, were found guilty of organized fraud and grand theft charges in May for defrauding businesses of more than $1 million.",
      "Turner, 63, was sentenced to five years in federal prison last month and three years of probation.",
      "Zeljka Bozanic, Kingston's lawyer, argued on Friday that even though Kingston is 35 years old, he still acts like he's a child.",
      "She attributed Kingston's crimes to a 2011 jet ski accident that left Kingston severely injured. She also argued that Kingston had no role models growing up besides his mother, who was in prison at the time of his overnight fame, and noted that most of the businesses have been paid back.",
      "\"I know he\u2019s very sorry for what he\u2019s done,\" she said.",
      "Kingston briefly addressed the court, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve learned from my actions.\" His attorney needed to adjust the mic for him so he could be heard.",
      "The prosecution shot down the notion that Kingston's criminal activity had anything to do with his accident and suggested that Kingston be sentenced to 60 months in prison.",
      "\"He is a thief through and through,\" Marc Anton, a lawyer for the Justice Department, said.",
      "The rapper's requests to self surrender due to scheduled medical appointments were denied. He was remanded once the sentencing on Friday concluded.",
      "Kingston's supporters said, \"we love you,\" as he was being taken away.",
      "Another restitution hearing is set for Oct. 16.",
      "The rapper, who is best known for his 2007 hit song \u201cBeautiful Girls,\u201d was arrested in Fort Irwin, California, in May following a SWAT raid on his home in Southwest Ranches, Florida, in Broward County.",
      "Kingston and his mother were then indicted in 2024. Prosecutors accused Kingston and his mother of using his celebrity name to trick luxury businesses into delivering items before payment.",
      "Payment was then made using fraudulent or worthless wire transfers, according to the indictment. Turner and Kingston would then keep the stolen items.",
      "Arrest warrants said the mother and son defrauded a jewelry business, a luxury bed company, a used luxury and exotic car dealership, and a luxury microLED TV company.",
      "The scheme transpired for several years until March 2024, according to the indictment. Kingston and Turner pleaded not guilty to the charges.",
      "Following their convictions, Kingston was ordered to be confined to house arrest with electronic monitoring, while his mother was remanded in federal custody.",
      "With the hit song \"Beautiful Girls\" reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100, Kingston became an overnight star at 17 years old. He has released three studio albums since the song came out in 2007."

      "A rock climber survived two days perched behind a roaring California waterfall before he was rescued earlier this week, authorities said.",
      "The climber, identified as Ryan Wardwell, 46, of Long Beach, California, was reported missing by family on Monday. He failed to return to his vehicle Sunday night following an attempt to rappel a waterfall in the Kern River\u2019s Seven Teacups area, the Tulare County Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a statement on Wednesday.",
      "By the time first responders reached the area in Sequoia National Forest on Monday, it was getting dark, and they were only able to find a possible location for the climber using infrared technology, the sheriff\u2019s office said.",
      "On Tuesday morning, the office's swift-water dive and search-and-rescue teams used a drone that located Wardwell in roughly the same location, in an apparent cavity behind the waterfall.",
      "\"Wardwell was found alive and responsive,\" the sheriff's office said. \"He told Deputies he had come off his rappel lines and got trapped behind the waterfall because of the extreme hydraulics of the river.\"",
      "He was checked out at the scene and released to family on Tuesday following his rescue, the office said.",
      "Deputy Craig Douglas made the rescue with the help of colleagues and a crew on board a California Highway Patrol helicopter, it said.",
      "\"They were able to lower me perfectly right next to him,\" Douglas said in an interview on Friday. \"I was able to get him in a recovery suit, hook him up, get him back into the helicopter.\"",
      "Wardwell likely suffered from hypothermia, the deputy said.",
      "\"He was pretty much just extremely cold,\" Douglas said.",
      "Temperatures were in the low 60s early Tuesday morning in Ponderosa, a community about 6 miles north of Seven Teacups. The Kern River's North Fork can also run cold, as it's generally fed by the Sierra Nevada's winter snowpack.",
      "Authorities said Wardwell had rappelled the feature previously, but they warned it can be a danger regardless.",
      "Sheriff\u2019s Capt. Kevin Kemmerling told NBC affiliate KSEE of Fresno that Wardwell traveled to the waterfall with a group of  friends and fellow climbers who decided to retreat after determining rappelling would be too dangerous. He carried on alone, the captain told the station.",
      "He noted that three people drowned at roughly the same location in August 2024.",
      "The sheriff's office said visitors to the river should \"always be aware of their environment and capabilities, especially when navigating white water.\""

    "summary": "Fronted by star Michael Johnson, Grand Slam Track promised payouts bigger than any other in track. But athletes are still waiting to receive what they are owed.",
    "story": [
      "As summer began in 2024, former Olympic gold-medal sprinter Michael Johnson stood in a downtown Los Angeles restaurant that had been rented out for a big announcement. Johnson said he had secured $30 million in funding for a new track league, promising payments never before seen in track and field.",
      "In a sport where even top stars earn modest livings by the standards of professional athletes, Grand Slam Track represented a huge windfall. More than one-third of that promised funding would be earmarked for prize money alone, a pool of more than $3 million per meet. And the biggest winners at each of its four meets would pocket $100,000 per meet \u2014 five times as much as first place earned on track\u2019s other global circuit.",
      "Additionally, 48 competitors who signed contracts with the circuit could earn an annual base compensation, plus a cut of revenue from group licensing.",
      "Yet just 14 months after Johnson\u2019s grand announcement, and four months after the group held its first meet in Jamaica, Grand Slam Track has yet to pay many of its athletes and vendors, and Johnson acknowledged Friday that the cash crunch \u2014 what one source said was around $13 million in unpaid money to athletes alone \u2014 poses an existential threat to the fate of the circuit returning for a second season.",
      "\u201cThe cruelest paradox in all of this is we promised that athletes would be fairly and quickly compensated. Yet, here we are struggling with our ability to compensate them,\u201d said a statement signed by Johnson that was posted on social media Friday.",
      "Johnson also maintained that he is \u201cconfident about the future of Grand Slam Track.\u201d",
      "NBC News spoke with four agents who represent multiple athletes still owed money by Grand Slam Track, who spoke on condition of anonymity to retain relationships with organizers. Three expressed serious doubts the circuit would be able to drum up enough funding from investors and confidence from athletes to return for a second season, in 2026. A fourth said he was willing to give the benefit of the doubt, for now.",
      "\u201cMy message to our athletes is, look, it\u2019s not good,\u201d that agent said. \u201cBut on the other hand, their intent is to pay and we\u2019re going to wait for them to pay us. Otherwise, they won\u2019t have a future.\u201d",
      "Agents, coaches and meet organizers in track and field said their concerns about Grand Slam\u2019s trouble go far beyond receiving the money owed from the three meets it hosted this spring in Jamaica, Florida and Philadelphia. If Grand Slam Track were ultimately successful in drawing strong ratings and crowds, there was a hope that such demand could entice more outside investors with deep pockets to pour money into a sport that often operates on shoestring budgets compared to other professional leagues.",
      "\u201cIt feels like to a lot of people that this will be a massive deterrent to future endeavors,\u201d said Paul Doyle, a prominent athlete agent who founded and has also operated a pro track circuit, the American Track League, since 2014. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t all negative. I feel for them in that sense that they\u2019re in a tough spot.\u201d",
      "On the day Johnson announced Grand Slam Track in 2024, he was bullish but also admitted the venture would take time to generate money.",
      "\u201cIf I had an investor who said, \u2018Well, I need it to be profitable in Year 2,\u2019 I would not take their money because that\u2019s impossible,\u201d Johnson said in 2024. \u201cIt\u2019s just not going to happen. Our investors have come on and said, \u2018Hey, we believe in the long-term viability of this.\u2019\u201d",
      "That viability has been under scrutiny ever since Grand Slam Track canceled its fourth and final meet, scheduled for June. It emailed athlete representatives in July notifying them that earnings from their first meet, held in Jamaica in April, would be paid by that month\u2019s end. On Aug. 4, a spokesperson for Grand Slam Track said that it was \u201canticipating investor funds to hit our account imminently, and the athletes are our top priority.\u201d",
      "As of Friday\u2019s announcement, however, Grand Slam had only paid athletes for the appearance fees they were owed in Jamaica, but not any prize money.",
      "Johnson, in his statement, suggested that the funding shortfall was due to a change in circumstances \u201cin ways beyond our control.\u201d Johnson previously told Front Office Sports that an investor had pulled funds.",
      "\u201cDue to our strong desire to make this right as quickly as possible, we offered dated payment timelines and have been unable to meet them,\u201d Johnson said in Friday\u2019s statement. \u201cUnderstandably, this has led to frustration, disappointment, and inconvenience to our athletes, agents, and vendors. I know this damages trust. I know this makes some wonder if our vision can survive. That is why we are not just addressing the immediate problem; we are putting systems and partnerships in place to make sure it never happens again.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile I am no stranger to setbacks and overcoming obstacles, as an athlete, professionally, and personally, this current situation of not being able to pay our athletes and partners has been one of the most difficult challenges I\u2019ve ever experienced,\u201d the statement added.",
      "Prize money payments that take weeks to arrive are not unusual in track and field; if anything, they are the rule. In extreme cases, athletes have said that prize money payments have taken more than a calendar year to hit their accounts. Prize money from March\u2019s world indoor championships in China still has yet to arrive, one agent said. Delays largely stem from drug testing, because meets typically wait to pay until knowing an athlete was clean. Results generally take 10-30 days to return. In contracts with its \u201cracers,\u201d Grand Slam Track stated that drug testing would be completed within 21 days of each meet, and that an athlete\u2019s promotional fee and earned prize money would be paid within 10 days of learning the doping results, according to a source.",
      "Delays are commonplace. But what made Grand Slam Track different, one agent said, was that there was a belief it already had its announced $30 million in funding waiting in escrow, ready to pay as obligated.",
      "Instead, they now wait for emailed updates from Grand Slam organizers.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not getting anything directly answered,\u201d one agent said. \u201c\u2018Our goal is to pay.\u2019 Well you can pay, but when? That doesn\u2019t sit well with anyone.\u201d"

Zelenskyy may be invited to the next round of talks, but for many watching this meeting between Trump and Putin, it may seem clear who has the upper hand.",
      "Friday\u2019s meeting wasn\u2019t the first time a Russian and American president rode together in the presidential limo. In 2010, President Barack Obama and President Dmitry Medvedev both rode in the Beast to have lunch at Ray\u2019s Hell Burger in Arlington, Virginia.",
      "But Medvedev, unlike Trump, had not been accused of war crimes by the International Criminal Court, nor was he involved in a conflict that critics have called a blatant land grab."

    "summary": "Doctors are hoping that the first nasal flu vaccine available for use at home can improve vaccination rates among people who are afraid of needles.",
    "story": [
      "More children died from the flu this past season than any year outside of the swine flu pandemic in 2009. Most of them were unvaccinated.",
      "That's why some doctors are hoping that the first nasal flu vaccine available for use at home can improve vaccination rates among people, especially children, who are afraid of needles.",
      "AstraZeneca's FluMist Home, which was approved last fall, is now available with a prescription for children ages 2 and over, and adults up to age 49.",
      "A 2019 review from researchers at the University of Michigan found the majority of children and up to 30% of young adults are afraid of needles.",
      "Dr. Zachary Hoy, board-certified pediatric infectious disease specialist at Pediatrix Medical Group in Nashville, Tennessee, said many children are scared because they aren't old enough to understand what vaccines are and why they are important.",
      "\u201cMost of the time, the anxiety and worry before the shot is scarier than the actual shot,\u201d Hoy said.",
      "How does FluMist Home work?",
      "The vaccine was first approved in 2003 to be given in a doctor's office. However, after the 2009 swine flu pandemic introduced the new H1N1 strain, several studies found the nasal spray was less effective than other flu vaccines. This prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to recommend against using the nasal spray in 2016. At the time, the CDC said the nasal spray accounted for one-third of all flu vaccines given to children.",
      "In response, FluMist\u2019s manufacturers reformulated it to more closely match circulating strains, including H1N1, and the nasal spray returned in 2018. Like injectable flu vaccines, FluMist is updated each season based on recommendations from global health officials.",
      "\u201cFluMist\u2019s efficacy is comparable to injectable flu vaccines and is a safe and effective needle-free option for flu protection,\u201d AstraZeneca spokesperson Andrew Leone said.",
      "Experts say it\u2019s too early to tell how bad the upcoming flu season will be.",
      "Typically, flu vaccines are 40% and 60% effective in preventing severe illness, and FluMist Home should be equally protective. The doses for the 2026-2027 season contain three virus strains: an A/H1N1 strain, an A/H3N2 strain and a B strain from the B/Victoria lineage, according to the drugmaker.",
      "The FluMist Home vaccine contains a weakened form of a live virus to stimulate the immune system. Pregnant women or people with compromised immune systems are advised to talk with their doctor before using it.",
      "Does insurance cover it?",
      "FluMist Home is available only online. People ordering the nasal spray will need to complete a medical screening questionnaire at FluMist.com that is reviewed by a health care professional, according to the drugmaker. FluMist Home\u2019s online pharmacy will then collect the insurance information and bill the health plan directly.",
      "A temperature monitor on the packaging will verify that the vaccine has been maintained at the appropriate temperature during shipping and delivery. Green means it's safe to use. Red means it's not.",
      "Christina Aungst, senior pharmacy editor at GoodRx, estimates people with insurance will likely only have to pay an $8.99 shipping fee for the nasal spray.",
      "\u201cCurrently, if you don\u2019t have insurance, FluMist is only available in a health care setting,\u201d AstraZeneca's Leone said. \u201cWe hope to provide a cash pay option for FluMist Home in future seasons.\u201d",
      "When FluMist is given in a health care office or clinic, most insurance plans \u2014 including Medicare and Medicaid \u2014 will cover it.",
      "Dr. Scott Roberts, associate medical director of infection prevention at Yale School of Medicine, worries people may not administer the nasal spray vaccine properly without a doctor's supervision.",
      "\u201cWhat if they have a runny nose? How far back do they need to spray in the nose? What if they store it incorrectly in their house?\u201d Roberts asked.",
      "Dr. Kristina Bryant, pediatric infectious diseases physician at Norton Children\u2019s in Louisville, Kentucky, and a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases, said the bottom line is that all the available flu vaccines offer comparable protection.",
      "\u201cThe most important thing to know is that vaccines only work if they are actually administered,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cHopefully, the availability of a vaccine that can be administered in the home will make it easier for some people to be protected against flu.\u201d"

      "New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell was indicted Friday on federal charges of defrauding the city while trying to keep her romantic relationship with a police officer a secret, prosecutors said.",
      "Cantrell is charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to obstruct justice, making false statements and false declaration before a grand jury, according to a federal indictment filed Friday in the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Louisiana.",
      "Shortly after the news broke, a lawyer for Cantrell told NBC News they had not yet seen the indictment and had no comment.",
      "The city said in a statement that it was aware of the indictment.",
      "\"The Mayor\u2019s attorney, Eddie Castaing, recently received the information, and is thoroughly reviewing the document,\" the statement said. \"Until his review is complete, the City will not comment further on this matter.\"",
      "Prosecutors allege that Cantrell was in a romantic relationship with Jeffrey Paul Vappie II, who served on the New Orleans Police Department's executive protection unit from May 2021 to April 2024.",
      "\u201cTo hide their relations from detection and to maximize their time together, Cantrell and Vappie exploited their public positions to develop and implement a scheme to defraud the city of New Orleans and the New Orleans Police Department by engaging in personal activities while Vappie claimed to be on duty and was paid for,\u201d the indictment states.",
      "Vappie was already facing charges of wire fraud and making false statements. He has pleaded not guilty. A grand jury returned an 18-count indictment Friday that added Cantrell to the case and new allegations against Vappie.",
      "He could not immediately be reached for comment Friday afternoon.",
      "If convicted, Cantrell and Vappie could face years in prison. Some of the counts outlined in the indictment carry up to five years in prison, and others up to 20 years.",
      "The pair's three-year fraud scheme exploited their public authority and position, Michael Simpson, an acting U.S. attorney with the Eastern District of Louisiana, said at a news conference Friday.",
      "Cantrell was married during that period to attorney Jason Cantrell, who died in August 2023.",
      "The mayor and Vappie have said their relationship was strictly professional, but the indictment portrayed it as \u201cpersonal and intimate.\u201d",
      "Federal prosecutors allege that the two used the WhatsApp platform to exchange 15,000 messages, pictures and audio clips in an eight-month period. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear when the messages were sent.",
      "Prosecutors say Cantrell and Vappie also used the app to intimidate subordinates, harass a citizen, delete evidence, lie to colleagues and commit perjury for the purpose of distracting and impeding investigations into their actions.",
      "Vappie accompanied Cantrell on 14 domestic and international trips to maximize their time together, federal prosecutors said.",
      "For example, during a working trip to San Francisco in April 2022, the pair stayed an extra day to visit Napa Valley wineries and Vappie claimed to have worked 15 hours, prosecutors said.",
      "In one text message, Cantrell characterized their moments together as \u201ctimes when we are truly alone,\u201d and as \u201cwhat spoils me the most,\u201d prosecutors said during Friday's news conference.",
      "In total, New Orleans spent $70,000 for Vappie's trips while he was with Cantrell, prosecutors claimed.",
      "They developed a personal and intimate relationship until Vappie retired in June 2024, they said.",
      "New Orleans City Council President JP Morrell on Friday offered prayers for Cantrell and her family.",
      "\u201cThis is a sad day for the people of New Orleans,\" Morrell said in a statement. \"Our thoughts and prayers are with the Cantrell family as they navigate through this difficult time.\"",
      "Cantrell, a Democrat, is in her last term as mayor and is set to leave office in January.",
      "She is the city's first female mayor in its 300-year history. Her second term has been turbulent, including surviving a recall effort in 2022.",
      "Cantrell is the first mayor in the city's history to face federal charges while in office, NBC affiliate WDSU of New Orleans reported.",
      "Former Mayor Ray Nagin was sentenced to 10 years in prison on bribery and other charges in 2014, after leaving office. The convictions related to crimes committed during his two terms. He was granted supervised release in 2020 because of the pandemic."

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s summit today with Russian President Vladimir Putin comes with incredibly high stakes for the future of Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine \u2014 and for Trump himself.",
      "The president seemed to be lowering expectations ahead of the face-to-face meeting, telling Fox News Radio yesterday that \u201cthere a 25% chance that this meeting will not be a successful meeting.\u201d",
      "So what does a win for Trump look like?",
      "A senior administration official also told me that Trump \u201cis realistic that this is likely a multistep process and he\u2019s ready and positive about this step forward.\u201d But Western and U.S. officials say that a victory for Trump is an unconditional and immediate ceasefire, and that if there are conditions attached, that\u2019s a win for Putin.",
      "It remains to be seen if Putin will try to cloud these talks by raising other issues on his agenda, like a nuclear arms deal and easing sanctions against Russia. It\u2019s also unclear whether Trump will offer any incentives to the Russians, and keep his promise to Ukraine and European allies that he will not negotiate territory.",
      "All of this underscores the political risk for Trump as he navigates a war that has cost hundreds of thousands of lives and fueled a robust debate over how long the U.S. should provide financial and military support to Ukraine.",
      "Trump said during the 2024 campaign that he would end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours upon taking office, but he has acknowledged that doing so is far more complicated than he could have anticipated. Meanwhile, recent polling has found that more voters disapprove of his handling of the war.",
      "A recent Wall Street Journal poll found a slim majority of voters (51%) disapproving of Trump\u2019s handling of the Russia-Ukraine war, while 41% approved (the survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points). That poll also showed that 58% of voters were in favor of sending additional financial aid to Ukraine, a 10-point increase since January, while 36% were in opposition.",

      "\u2709\ufe0f Mailbag: Where does the tariff money go?",
      "Thanks to everyone who emailed us! This week\u2019s question comes from Tara Vargas:",
      "\u201cTrump claims to be raking in trillions from tariffs. I read that the money goes into the general fund. But does it really? And if not there, where?\u201d",
      "To answer that, we turned to business reporter Rob Wile. Here\u2019s his response:",
      "Yes, it does go into the U.S. Treasury\u2019s General Fund \u2014 something the department calls \u201cAmerica\u2019s Checkbook\u201d \u2014 and is used to finance both daily and long-term government operations, ranging from federal employee salaries to interest payments.",
      "Congress establishes how the general fund is spent in its appropriations bills. While the Treasury Department tracks where revenues come from, it generally does not individually earmark a set of funds from a given revenue source for a specific purpose.",
      "\u201cYou can think of [tariffs revenues] as helping reduce the overall deficit, or offsetting the costs of the One Big Beautiful Bill,\u201d said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director at the nonpartisan think tank Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t go into any kind of dedicated trust fund.\u201d",
      "In July, the Treasury took in about $29 billion in tariffs. Every month since April, when Trump announced \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs, has seen record tariffs revenues come in. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget projects that the tariffs could bring in as much as $1.3 trillion of net new revenues through the end of Trump\u2019s current term, and $2.8 trillion through 2034 \u2014 though it cautions these estimates are \u201cvery rough\u201d and intended to reflect \u201cthe general magnitude\u201d of Trump\u2019s overall approach to the import taxes \u201cgiven the complexity of the tariffs and their impacts.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Government Accountability Office, the chief auditing agency of the federal government, has found significant, long-running issues with how General Fund payments are tracked and reported, though it does not suggest any funds are actively being misappropriated.",
      "The Treasury, it said in March, \u201crecords transactions as a group total instead of individual balances and then processes them through a variety of systems.\u201d",
      "It continued: \u201cAs a result, we did not have enough information to determine if the amounts reported are reliable, and therefore, the Schedules were not auditable. More recently, we\u2019ve identified additional challenges that impact the ability to clearly track funds. This includes oversight of information coming from outside entities, such as banks, that collect money on behalf of the federal government.\u201d",

      "Watson said, \u201cHell no\u201d as he scrambled out of the car and out of the camera\u2019s view. Someone was heard yelling outside followed by a gunshot and then the sound of a vehicle speeding away.",
      "Shortly after, a man was heard screaming,\u201cHey Tugg! Call the police!\u201d and other voices were heard clamoring before police arrived.",
      "Watson was hit in the chest and transported to Mt. Sinai Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The shooting is under investigation, and no one is in custody, police said.",

      "She said Friday that she was with her brother an hour before the shooting.",
      "After they parted ways, Shamika Watson ran errands then returned to Madison Street, where her brother was known to hang out.

      "Why were DermaRite hand soaps recalled?",

    "summary": "Mousse sunscreen may feel nice going on, but the FDA says the formula doesn\u2019t comply with federal laws",
    "story": [
      "Wearing sunscreen is non-negotiable. Experts have told us over and over that applying it daily can lower your risk of developing skin cancer and prevent early signs of aging. And while there are some rules around the type of sunscreens that are best \u2014 like you should opt for a SPF 30 or higher \u2014 other things are generally thought to be dependent on personal preference. For example, some people may prefer a mineral option, while others like a chemical sunscreen. Formula consistency is another thing that has always been thought to be up to preference \u2014 silky serum, creamy lotion, whatever.",
      "But the US Food and Drug Administration just issued warnings to several popular sunscreen brands, suggesting that there is one type of sunscreen that is better left on the shelf. These brands all sell trendy mousse sunscreens (also called whipped sunscreen), and the FDA says this specific type of formulation may not be safe. Below, everything you need to know about this warning.",
      "Why is the FDA issuing warnings about mousse sunscreen?",
      "Whipped sunscreens from brands like Supergoop! and Vacation Inc. have been one of the trendier beauty products of the summer. But the FDA is letting consumers know that they should proceed with caution. On August 12, they posted a message on X that said, \u201cBeware of sunscreen products in mousse form because they might not be effective. The FDA issued five warning letters to companies marketing sunscreen products in mousse form.\u201d",
      "The FDA explained that regulations allow brands to market sunscreens as creams, lotions, sticks, sprays and a few other formulations \u2014 but they do not allow for mousse or whipped formulations. They also said that certain companies have created bottles that look like cans of whipped cream, which can put consumers at risk if ingested.",
      "The brands that received warning letters are Supergoop!, Vacation Inc., Kalani Sunwear, Fallian Cosmeceuticals (TiZo brand) and K & Care Organics. These letters don\u2019t necessarily mean the mousse sunscreens produced by these brands are unsafe. The FDA just requires that any new form is required to have sufficient data proving they are safe and effective \u2014 and those things haven\u2019t been submitted.",
      "The brands have 15 working days to respond. If they fail to comply, it is possible that the products could be pulled from the market.",
      "Other sunscreens we love",
      "The coming weeks will be very telling when it comes to mousse sunscreens and whether or not these companies address the concerns raised by the FDA. Until then, it may be a smarter move to stick to formulations not under attack by the FDA.

    "story": [
      "A local Mexican restaurant chain in Pennsylvania is trying to forge ahead a week after a worksite\u202fimmigration raid left property damage at two of its storefronts and a workforce afraid to show up to their jobs, according to two employees and a witness who spoke with NBC News.",
      "It all started Aug. 7 when immigration authorities showed up at two Emiliano\u2019s Mexican Restaurant & Bar locations in the Pittsburgh area. As many as 16 workers were detained \u2014 nine worked at a location in Gibsonia, a suburb north of Pittsburgh, and seven others worked at another location in the nearby township of Cranberry.",
      "In a social media post that same afternoon, which included a video taken by a worker, the business accused agents of storming into its restaurants and leaving \u201ca trail of fear, confusion, and destruction\u201d that included a burned kitchen, torn ceiling tiles, broken doors, a safe cut open by an agent and trashed food. The incident raises questions over the tactics used by authorities at this particular raid.",
      "This week, gas plumbers fixed a stove that was damaged during the raid, according to two people working at the restaurant chain. Staffing was also thin at the locations targeted by immigration authorities as employees who witnessed the raid, including those who are U.S. citizens, remain \u201cin shock,\u201d they added. \u201cNo one wants to go back, everyone is scared.\u201d",
      "Both workers who spoke with NBC News requested to not be named to protect their family\u2019s privacy because of an ongoing federal investigation in connection with last week\u2019s events.",
      "The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania declined to clarify what the investigation it is leading is about.",
      "As the immigration arrests were happening last week, someone alerted an emergency response immigration hotline run by Casa San Jose, a local nonprofit that advocates for Latino and immigrant communities.",
      "The organization quickly dispatched about 20 volunteers to both locations to act as legal observers, collect testimonies and provide support to the workers and families affected, according to Jaime Martinez, a community defense organizer at Casa San Jose.",
      "At the Gibsonia location, \u201cthe raid actually caused a kitchen fire that agents were unable to extinguish at the beginning, which put people in danger,\u201d Martinez told NBC News on Tuesday.",
      "Employees who spoke to Martinez and his volunteers said the stove was on when agents entered the kitchen because workers were cooking food as they prepared to open the restaurant Thursday morning. The restaurant\u2019s manager warned agents that the open burners were on, but witnesses alleged that agents didn\u2019t do anything until a fire sparked, he said.",
      "The detained employees, who had their arms and ankles shackled, were the ones who directed the agents to find the fire extinguisher and instructed them on how to use it after initially failing to operate it, according to employees who spoke to Martinez and his volunteers.",
      "\u201cBy the time the fire department got there, the fire had already been put out with a dry chemical extinguisher, but only after this delay,\u201d Martinez said.",
      "A spokesperson with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement told NBC News in an email Thursday that the \u201cdamage to the restaurant, including the small fire, was created by the illegal aliens themselves while they were trying to escape or hide from law enforcement officers.\u201d",
      "According to ICE, the agents showed up at the locations in Gibsonia and Cranberry to execute federal search warrants based on information it got alleging that the restaurants were employing undocumented workers, WPXI, NBC\u2019s affiliate in Pittsburgh, reported. The agency added that the 16 people detained lack legal status and are now in ICE custody, undergoing immigration proceedings.",
      "\u201cBut in the process of coming in with that warrant, they also terrorized the community, pointed guns at people and destroyed a local business,\u201d Martinez said.",
      "In response to this, the ICE spokesperson told NBC News, \u201cAll agents and officers followed established legal procedures while executing the warrants.\u201d",
      "At the Cranberry location, Casa San Jose volunteers interviewed a worker who described seeing officers come into the restaurant, shouting \u201cpolice\u201d and pointing their long guns at the employees. One female employee who was in the kitchen said an agent \u201cpointed the gun at her head\u201d while telling her to stop cooking, according to Martinez.",
      "While she was not detained after showing proper documentation, \u201cthis lady is now going to have to live with the trauma of having law enforcement point a gun at her head while she was at work,\u201d Martinez said.",
      "Martinez and one of the workers who spoke with NBC News said agents lined up all of the cuffed employees and made them kneel while pointing their weapons at them.",
      "\u201cAgents and officers operated within established law enforcement standards in order to ensure the safety of law enforcement officers, the public and the illegal aliens themselves,\u201d the ICE spokesperson said in response to this allegation.",
      "Last week was not the first time immigration authorities attempted to detain employees from Emiliano\u2019s Mexican Restaurant & Bar. The ICE spokesperson confirmed to NBC News that a June incident was part of \u201can investigation that ultimately led to the execution of the warrants\u201d this month.",
      "Martinez said that on a night in June, he got a call on the hotline, reporting unmarked vehicles surrounding a nearby apartment complex. When the volunteer who was dispatched arrived at the area, she noticed the vehicles were parked with their engines still running, in front and behind the restaurant.",
      "According to Martinez, it looked like federal agents inside the vehicles were waiting for workers to come out of the restaurant as it was closing. The vehicles left once TV crews arrived on the scene, he said.",
      "\u201cThere were nine people in that restaurant on lockdown,\u201d Martinez said, adding his group doesn\u2019t know the immigration status of those workers since it doesn\u2019t ask people about that as part of its policy. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to be undocumented to be afraid of getting detained.\u201d",
      "Since launching the hotline in March, Casa San Jose has received more than 650 calls reporting more than 100 immigration detentions in the area and has dispatched volunteers in at least 70 instances, according to Martinez.",
      "In the wake of the raids at Emiliano\u2019s Mexican Restaurant and Bar locations, the community came together and collectively donated more than $133,000. The workers who spoke with NBC News said the business plans to use the funds to cover bond expenses, one month worth of salary for each employee detained and repair damage done to the restaurant."

      "Odenkirk\u2019s character, who was first introduced in the Bryan Cranston-led crime drama \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d received a spinoff series in 2015 that served as an origin story for Saul Goodman. It followed the Albuquerque, New Mexico criminal defense attorney, born Jimmy McGill, and his transformation from aspiring lawyer to the ambitious, and at times morally ambiguous, lawyer with ties to the criminal underworld.",
      "Created and executive produced by Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould, the same team behind \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d ended with Odenkirk\u2019s character serving an 86-year prison sentence after confessing to his crimes, which included supporting Walter White (Cranston)\u2019s drug operation and acknowledging the role he played in his brother Howard\u2019s death.",

      "He's also aware of the strain it's put on him, telling The Hollywood Reporter that after years of playing Saul, in addition to his \u201cNobody\u201d character of Hutch, a highly-skilled assassin, he's \u201cfine with moving on\u201d from them.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re guys who, for different reasons, have pretty big chips on their shoulders, and that\u2019s hard to play after a while,\u201d Odenkirk told the outlet. \u201cYou can\u2019t just carry that guy around all the time.\u201d",
      "But, Odenkirk reveals to TODAY.com, a \"Better Call Saul\" revival is not out of the question. The actor exclusively tells us what it would take for him to reprise his \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d character and jump back into that universe.",
      "\u201cVince Gilligan and Peter Gould created that show. There are some of the best writers who ever worked in TV,\u201d he says. \u201cSo if they were to think of something in that world, of course I would do it.\u201d",
      "Though Odenkirk admits he would be up for the challenge, he feels it might be bit of a long shot.",
      "\u201cBut I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he says of a \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d sequel or spinoff happening. \u201cI think they\u2019ve all moved on to some more amazing projects that you\u2019ll soon see.\u201d",
      "Odenkirk is referring to Gilligan\u2019s new Apple TV+ sci-fi drama called \u201cPluribus,\u201d which stars his \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d co-star Rhea Seehorn.",
      "The series, which has already been picked up for two seasons by Apple TV+, is described as a \u201cpsychological sci-fi drama set in a reimagined version of modern-day Albuquerque.\u201d Though official plot details have not yet been released, Odenkirk tells TODAY.com that the new show is \u201cgoing to be a great one.\u201d",
      "\u201cLook forward to the best written show on TV for years to come,\u201d he teases of the new series.",

      "Instead of caring for her daughter or taking her to a nearby hospital, the lawsuit alleges Priscilla Presley \u201cclasped to the spotlight, going out to the Chateau Marmont for drinks with Lisa, and then sent Lisa on a long drive to her Calabasas home.\u201d",
      "Just over 24 hours later, Lisa Marie Presley was rushed to the hospital after she suffered cardiac arrest, the complaint states.",
      "Priscilla Presley went to the hospital, and \"despite Lisa\u2019s clear directive to \u2018prolong her life\u2019, Priscilla pulled the plug within hours of Lisa being admitted, and before her granddaughter, Riley, was able to get to the hospital,\u201d the complaint alleges.",

      "How Does \u2018Night Always Comes\u2019 End?",
      "Lynette tells Kenny she has to go away, but will come back to visit. After packing, she slips into her car (we\u2019d kind of hoped she\u2019d take her mom\u2019s brand-new vehicle, but that might get her into serious trouble).",
      "She leaves some money for Kenny and a note for her mother which reads in part, \u201cYou asked me what I did last night. I fought. I fought for this family. The only way I know how. But I guess you said what I needed to hear, so thank you. And now I need to fight for me.\u201d",

      "So how did things ultimately wrap up? Where do our leading ladies and men leave us? And just how did we go from Cosmos in clubs in the 1990s to pie in the kitchen in 2025? Let\u2019s examine the final episode, appropriately called \u201cParty of One.\u201d",
      "Are Carrie and Aidan Broken Up Forever?",
      "Considering that \u201cCadian\u201d broke up several episodes ago, that the first of the two-part finale was called \u201cForgot About the Boy,\u201d and the episode directly post-breakup skipped ahead to the fall without a reunion \u2014 yeah, it\u2019s safe to say that Aidan (John Corbett) sealed his fate when he declared he still couldn\u2019t trust Carrie.",
      "Who\u2019s next for Carrie, then?",
      "Maybe no one.",
      "The final episode of \u201cAJLT\u201d focuses on Carrie coming up with a new perspective on what it means to be not just out of a relationship, not just with none on the horizon, but what it might mean to not necessarily want one.",
      "\u201cSeriously though, who will I be alone?\u201d she asks Charlotte. \u201cI\u2019ve never lived alone without the thought that I wouldn\u2019t be alone for long.\u201d She confesses that after Big\u2019s death, she thought that Aidan might be her natural next step. Then she\u2019d considered Duncan as a possibility \u2014 but he left New York City, and it\u2019s hard to imagine Carrie picking up and following him.",
      "Then Carrie had her big revelation: \u201cI have to quit thinking, \u2018Maybe a man?\u2019 and start accepting maybe just me,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not a tragedy, it\u2019s a fact, and I just have to start accepting it full stop.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s a throwback to her new novel, whose original ending of a woman being happy being alone triggered her editor, leading to Carrie writing an epilogue in which love is a possibility for the single woman in the future. But in the end, post-Thanksgiving, Carrie returns to her apartment with leftover pie and rewrites the epilogue to read, \u201cThe woman realized she was not alone \u2014 she was on her own.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a solid period on the end of a sentence. The fact is, after many years of the story of Carrie, her friends and lovers, our heroine\u2019s longest-lasting relationship has not been with men. Or fashion. Or even her friends. Carrie\u2019s real love affair has been with herself, and her writing. It is the thing that gives her purpose and sets her apart from nearly everyone else she knows.",
      "What Happens to All the Other Characters?",
      "So where does that leave everyone else?",
      "With their loved ones, actually. As ever, the \u201cSex\u201d-iverse leaves everyone else as ancillary satellites circling Carrie\u2019s world, but we do get some insights as to where everyone else\u2019s mostly-happily-ever-after lives are heading next.",
      "Lisa (Nicole Ari Parker) avoids her affair with her editor and comes home to a still-mourning Herbert (Christopher Jackson) and they promise to get through his political defeat together.",
      "Miranda and Joy (Dolly Wells) undergo a dog surgery and a particularly disgusting post-Thanksgiving bathroom disaster and end up embracing.",
      "Seema (Sarita Choudhury) and Adam (Logan Marshall-Green) work around their differences in tradition and gluten, and have a pie-eating Thursday instead of a traditional Thanksgiving. But not before Carrie determines that the free spirit is in for the long haul with Seema.",
      "Brady (Niall Cunningham) and baby mama-to-be Mia (Ella Stiller, daughter of Ben) are far from reconciled, but Mia and her friends do make Miranda\u2019s Thanksgiving interesting, and Mia decides that Miranda is kind of cool after all.",
      "Charlotte and Harry (Evan Handler) discover there is life after prostate cancer surgery, and celebrate Thanksgiving with their children.",
      "Anthony (Mario Cantone) and Giuseppe (Sebastiano Pigazzi) discuss Giuseppe\u2019s real intentions with Anthony. Guess they really are going to get married.",
      "Aidan is nowhere in sight.",
      "Is 'And Just Like That' Really Over?",
      "Was this a true finale \u2014 or will we see more of Carrie & Co. in the future?",
      "Too soon to tell. There are enough loose threads to create another spin-off. There\u2019s always a scenario where Carrie abandons her newfound sense of self and races off to the UK to chase Duncan. But let\u2019s face it, the end credits roll with a replay of the theme music to \u201cSex and the City.\u201d We think this is probably the end \u2014 for now.",
      "After all, Carrie has reached a point of acceptance of being alone, but not lonely. She has her friends and their offspring. She likes her home, even if it is a little too big. It\u2019s kind of nice to leave her in her beautiful red frock, dancing to Barry White\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019re the First, the Last, My Everything,\u201d eating pie direct from the pan with a spoon.",
      "It\u2019s as if the show is saying: This is not a tragedy. This is a victory.",
      "How wonderful, how wonderful, how wonderful."

I feel like they should put her in the kitchen or something where nobody has to see her face, ya know?\u2019\u201d Rife said. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Yeah, but I feel like if she could cook, she wouldn\u2019t have that black eye.'\u201d",

      "\u201cI figure if we start the show with domestic violence the rest of the show should be smooth sailing,\u201d he continued.",

      "\"Someone let this guy up on stage, filmed it, and it got approved to be put on Netflix?\" one user said.",
      "\"Got the heebie jeebies ab this man so quickly and I've been continuously proved right ever since,\" another added.",

      "In response to the backlash, Rife shared an Instagram story with a link that he said was his \u201cofficial apology,\u201d NBC News reported. However, he linked to a health website that sold special needs helmets.",
      "In an interview with Variety at the time, Rife seemingly defended the jokes he made during the special. Rife shared that \u201cNatural Selection\u201d was designed to cater to a male audience, as he wanted to show people he doesn\u2019t \u201cpander his career to women.\u201d",
      "Less than two years later, Rife\u2019s feature in the e.l.f. campaign has critics questioning the brand\u2019s decision to platform the comedian.",

      "\u201cYou know us, we\u2019re always listening and we\u2019ve heard you,\u201d the brand wrote.",
      "\u201cThis campaign aimed to humorously spotlight beauty injustice. We understand we missed the mark with people we care about in our e.l.f. community,\" the statement continued.",
      "For some, the apology missed the mark.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sorry but this is a non apology? What exactly is e.l.f. going to do other than say you missed the mark? Now would be a good time to donate to & highlight organization that support dv survivors,\u201d one user commented on the post.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m failing to understand how I know yall you did your research on Matt Rife and still said yeah that\u2019s our guy\u2026\u201d added another.",
      "In an Aug. 14 interview with The Business of Beauty, e.l.f. Beauty\u2019s Global Chief of Marketing Officer Kory Marchisotto addressed the brand's decision to feature Rife in the campaign.",

      "Marchisotto said the backlash was a surprise to the brand.",
      "\u201cObviously we\u2019re very surprised,\u201d Marchisotto told the outlet. \u201cThere is a big gap between our intention and how this missed the mark for some people \u2026 We always aim to deliver positivity, and this one didn\u2019t. So we find ourselves in a position where, quite honestly, that doesn\u2019t feel good for us.\u201d"

      "In 2023, Swift practically broke the internet when she first appeared at a Kansas City Chiefs game to support Travis Kelce \u2014 months after he revealed on \"New Heights,\" the podcast he co-hosts with brother Jason Kelce, that he attempted to give the pop star a friendship bracelet with his phone number on it at one of an \"Eras Tour\" concert.",

      "When she first saw the clip of him from that July 2023 episode, Swift asked around to see if he\u2019d ever tried to attend a meet-and-greet or connect at another show. Since she rarely scrolls social media and doesn\u2019t check her DMs, she found his approach refreshingly bold.",

      "Some fans believe they spotted hints for \u201cShowgirl\u201d as far back as 10 months ago, when Swift posted an Instagram video of herself walking through Miami's Hard Rock Stadium ahead of another \u201cEras Tour\u201d show. As she walks, her cat in her arms, she briefly passes a sign reading \"A12,\" potentially hinting at her Aug. 12 announcement.",
      "Fans are also claiming that she teased \"Life of a Showgirl\" in her \"The Eras Tour\" book. The final chapter of this book is called \"Behind the Scenes,\" and is a similar orange hue as all of the new album art teasers that have been revealed so far.",

      "Arab governments that for decades have been fierce advocates for the Palestinian cause are now facing criticism for their timid response to the extreme suffering in Gaza caused by Israel's war, risking a dangerous rift with their increasingly restive citizens.",
      "As deaths from starvation and Israeli bombardment have mounted, Palestinians, their supporters and some analysts have directed their anger toward Arab rulers in the region whom they perceive as being too passive and quiet. They point to countries outside the Middle East who have publicly criticized Israel and tried to stop it from expanding its military operations in Gaza.",
      "\u201cWhere are the Arabs? The Arabs are napping. The Arabs are nowhere to be seen. The Arabs, and I\u2019m talking about the Arab rulers, have buried their heads in the sand,\u201d said Fawaz Gerges, professor of international relations at the London School of Economics.",
      "The situation in Gaza has become even more dire as Palestinians risk their lives to get food. An aid distribution system implemented by the U.S. and the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has led to hundreds more Palestinians being killed, often by Israeli soldiers.",
      "Wafaa Eeed, a Palestinian woman in Gaza, told NBC News last month that she had walked several miles to a GHF aid distribution site on July 24, a day set aside only for women. She and two other witnesses said they were shot at, pepper-sprayed and tear-gassed.",
      "\u201cArab states, why don\u2019t you help us? We don\u2019t want the Americans,\u201d Eeed said.",

      "The Israel Defense Forces said that \"troops operating in the Rafah area identified suspects who approached them, posing a threat to the troops\" and fired warning shots.",
      "It was not aware of casualties, and the shots were fired \"hundreds of meters away\" from the GHF site before its opening hours, it said.",
      "Israel also denies there is starvation in Gaza, contradicting medics in the Palestinian enclave, global aid groups and even a close ally, President Donald Trump.",
      "Some Arab leaders dependent on American aid and security guarantees are wary of angering the U.S. and Israel and see little strategic advantage in helping Palestinians, whom they may even see as a threat, experts say.",
      "Arab states have participated in airdrops of aid and food convoys into Gaza, but Palestinians and aid groups say it\u2019s nowhere near enough to ward off a looming famine. Egypt and Qatar have also mediated talks among Israel, the U.S. and Hamas, but they have not led to an end to the conflict.",
      "Several Latin American states, along with Spain, Ireland and Norway, have blasted Israel for its conduct in Gaza and threatened sanctions or a downgrade of diplomatic ties.",
      "And in recent weeks, longtime Israeli allies like France and Australia have pledged to officially recognize Palestine \u2014 a move decried by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government. In late 2023, South Africa filed a case with the United Nations\u2019 top court alleging that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza.",
      "Arab states have been much less vocal, with Egypt and Jordan even cracking down on pro-Palestinian protests and activism, fearing they could turn against the country\u2019s leaders, experts say.",
      "\u201cPalestine resonates deeply in the Arab imagination,\" Gerges said. \"Palestine reminds Arabs of the subservience of their governments. Palestine reminds Arabs of the hegemony and domination and the continuing colonialism and imperialism of the West.\"",
      "He added, \u201cI would say that Gaza, the tragedy of Gaza, the destruction of Gaza, could really serve as a time bomb that implodes the Arab political order from within.\u201d",
      "Polling before Oct. 7, 2023, showed that most Arab citizens rejected normalizing ties with Israel, a sentiment subsequent surveys show has only deepened since.",
      "A survey published in June by pollster Arab Barometer found that support for such a move has collapsed, not exceeding 13 percent in the seven countries surveyed.",
      "The Egyptian and Jordanian embassies in the U.S., along with the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on this story.",
      "Egypt and Jordan, even with the crackdown, have allowed limited protests, though hundreds of activists have also been arrested, according to Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.",
      "The Gulf states rarely allow protests, but they have largely maintained diplomatic and trade links with Israel throughout its devastating offensive in the Gaza strip that began after the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks, in which some 1,200 were killed and 250 taken hostage.",
      "Health officials in Gaza say that more than 61,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, have been killed in the ensuing war.",
      "Many academics, including Israeli scholars, have in recent months joined rights groups in condemning Israel\u2019s operations in Gaza as genocide, a charge Israel vehemently denies.",
      "\u201cDespite the genocide, in the middle of the genocide, this extraordinary depravity that we see in Gaza, not a single Arab state that has relations with Israel has cut relations with Israel, although other states in other parts of the world have,\u201d said Ussama Makdisi, professor of history and chancellor\u2019s chair at the University of California, Berkeley.",
      "The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain were among the Arab states that signed the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords in 2020, paving the way for economic and diplomatic ties with Israel. Saudi Arabia had been set to follow, but the Gaza conflict put those plans on hold.",
      "For Gulf Arab states, better ties with Israel have little to do with public attitudes and more to do with realpolitik, experts say. The Gulf states host several U.S. military bases that analysts say help shield them from regional rival Iran and also help maintain Western access to the region\u2019s vast energy supplies.",
      "Access to Israel\u2019s vibrant tech sector has also been a draw for some Arab states, who have used its surveillance technology to stifle dissent, experts and rights groups say.",
      "\u201cThose regimes in the Arab world that depend on the U.S. for their security, they don\u2019t depend on their legitimacy vis a vis their own people. They depend on U.S. protection, U.S. military bases,\u201d Makdisi said.",
      "Houthi rebels, who control large parts of Yemen, have fired missiles and drones at Israel and ships in the region in what they say is an attempt to end Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza, but Yemen is alone among Arab states in pressuring Israel militarily. Arab countries could apply economic pressure through oil embargoes or restricting access to the Suez Canal and Arab airspace, but experts say such moves are unlikely.",
      "Arab countries once supplied Palestinian militant groups with weapons, funding and bases from which to attack Israel, but such solidarity proved costly and dangerous.",
      "In Jordan, tensions between Palestinian militant groups and the ruling monarchy exploded into the \u201cBlack September\u201d civil war in 1970, leading to the militants\u2019 eventual expulsion and relocation to Lebanon.",
      "The presence of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Lebanon in the 1970s exacerbated the country\u2019s civil war and triggered an Israeli invasion in 1982 to target \u201cPalestinian terrorists.\u201d",
      "More recently, Israel invaded Lebanon last year, heavily bombing southern Beirut in an offensive against the Hezbollah militant group, which had been firing rockets at Israel in solidarity with Hamas.",
      "Hezbollah and Hamas are backed by Iran, which has led some Arab states to distance themselves from both groups.",
      "For Ryan Crocker, former U.S. ambassador to Iraq, Lebanon and Kuwait, lukewarm Arab support for the Palestinian cause is less about U.S. and Israeli pressure and more about self-preservation.",
      "\u201cThe Palestinians, both the cause, the PLO and the population, in the Jordanian and Lebanese examples, have both been seen as a threat to the rule of these Arab regimes,\u201d Crocker told NBC News.",
      "The U.S. and Israel had floated plans for Arab countries to accept tens of thousands of Gaza refugees, but the idea was flatly rejected, with those Arab countries fearing both renewed Palestinian militancy and accusations of aiding ethnic cleansing, experts say.",
      "Crocker compared Palestinians to the Kurds, another stateless group in the Middle East.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a saying among the Kurds, who are scattered between Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey, that they have no friends but the mountains,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, the Palestinians don\u2019t even have the mountains.\u201d"

    "summary": "Vice President JD Vance was greeted with protesters  holding funny signs as he vacationed in the Cotswolds in England's countryside.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014  JD Vance got a very English welcome after he, his family and their large security detail rolled through the village of Charlbury this week, just not the kind the vice president would  have hoped for.",
      "Bathed in sunshine, dozens of demonstrators drank tea, ate cake  featuring a meme of the vice president\u2019s face and held up humorous placards Tuesday in the small community in the Cotswolds, as this part of the countryside is known.",
      "\u201cJD Vance Netflix password is \u2018password,\u2019\u201d said one handmade sign at a protest near where the Vances are vacationing some 100 miles west of the capital, London.",
      "A second sign declared that Vance \u201cclaps when the plane lands,\u201d referring to a practice mocked by some Britons who see it as very un-British overenthusiasm. Others held placards quoting Vance when he said he \u201cnever liked\u201d President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cCotswolds childless cat ladies say go home,\u201d another read, referring to comments Vance made to former Fox News host Tucker Carlson in 2021 about senior Democrats in Congress that resurfaced during last year\u2019s presidential race.",
      "In the nearby town of Chipping Norton, some locals said they were unprepared for the level of security disruption as some of the already tight roads in the area were closed for Vance\u2019s motorcade.",
      "Design manager Geoff Holliday, 51, said Wednesday he was \u201cgetting bored\u201d with the closures, adding that he was longing for the motorcade to be slowed down by \u201ca disgruntled farmer and a combine harvester.\u201d",
      "Nestled among the rolling hills that rise up from meadows of the upper River Thames, the Cotswolds\u2019 picture-postcard towns and villages have been popular with holidaymakers for centuries.",
      "More recently, the area has attracted a wealthier crowd.",
      "Chipping Norton and its surrounding area are known for the \u201cChipping Norton set,\u201d including former Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife, Samantha Cameron; Elizabeth Murdoch,  media executive and daughter of Rupert Murdoch; and more recently, comedian and talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.",
      "Former \"Top Gear\" presenter Jeremy Clarkson\u2019s \u201cDiddly Squat Farm\u201d in Chadlington is also nearby, and he shared an image on Instagram which highlighted how his farm is under a no-fly zone over the Cotswolds.",
      "Appearing to reference filming for his \u201cClarkson\u2019s Farm\u201d Amazon show, he wrote: \u201cThe JD Vance no fly zone. We are the pin. So on the downside, no drone shots today. On the upside, no annoying light aircraft.\u201d",
      "Later, he shared a video of a peaceful Cotswolds scene."

      "A growing number of U.S. politicians are condemning a new British law that requires some websites and apps \u2014 including some based in the United States \u2014 to check the ages of users across the pond.",
      "A bipartisan group of members of Congress visited London recently to meet counterparts and air their concerns about the U.K.\u2019s Online Safety Act, which went into effect July 25. Vice President JD Vance has been criticizing the law for months, as have privacy advocates who argue that the law infringes on free expression and disproportionately hurts vulnerable groups.",
      "Vance criticized the U.K. again on Friday, this time in person at the start of a visit to the country. Sitting alongside British Foreign Secretary David Lammy and speaking to reporters, Vance warned the U.K. against going down a \u201cvery dark path\u201d of online \u201ccensorship\u201d that he said was trod earlier by the Biden administration.",
      "The U.K. Online Safety Act is aimed at preventing children from accessing potentially harmful material online, and internet companies are now asking British users to verify their ages in a variety of ways, including with photos of their IDs, through a credit card provider or with selfies analyzed via age-check software.",
      "But the sweeping nature of the law has caught some Britons by surprise. They\u2019re being asked to prove their age not only for pornography websites but also before they can listen to songs with explicit lyrics or access message boards to discuss sensitive subjects. Reddit, for example, is restricting access to various pages including r/stopsmoking, r/STD and r/aljazeera.",
      "Reddit said in a post about its enforcement of the law that for people in the U.K., it was now verifying ages before they can \u201cview certain mature content.\u201d A spokesperson for the company said r/STD \u2014 a message board focused on questions of sexual health \u2014 is restricted because of explicit images. They said r/stopsmoking is restricted because it deals with harmful substances and that r/aljazeera \u2014 which is not affiliated with the news organization of the same name but deals with similar topics \u2014 is restricted because it depicts serious injury or violence.",
      "To get around the new law, the use of virtual private network software that can mask a person\u2019s location, also known as VPNs, has surged in the U.K.",
      "The primary argument of U.S. politicians who oppose the law is that they don\u2019t want American tech companies to have to comply, even if they\u2019re serving British customers.",
      "House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said he raised his objections with U.K. government officials during meetings in London at the end of July. In a statement after his return, he said the law and other European regulations \u201ccreate a serious chilling effect on free expression and threaten the First Amendment rights of American citizens and companies.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe absolutely need to protect children and keep harmful, illegal content off these platforms \u2014 but when governments or bureaucracies suppress speech in the name of safety or regulation, it sets a dangerous precedent that threatens the core of Western democratic values,\u201d Jordan said.",
      "The issue may come to a head in a couple of different venues. That could be the courts if any tech companies file lawsuits over the law, or it could come up in trade negotiations if President Donald Trump decides to press the issue with British politicians, although they say it\u2019s not open to debate in trade talks.",
      "Marc Andreessen, a venture capitalist and Meta board member with close ties to the Trump administration, recently called U.K. leaders to complain about the law, the Financial Times reported Friday. A spokesperson for Andreessen said the report was not true.",
      "The U.K.\u2019s Online Safety Act is one of the most comprehensive national laws that any democracy has ever passed to try to curtail potentially harmful content online in the name of children. Parliament passed the law in 2023, and the government went through two years of writing detailed rules before putting the law into effect last month.",
      "The law is notable for a combination of reasons: the variety of content it applies to, the potential fines and the possible international reach.",
      "A wide array of content is at issue. While the \u201cprimary\u201d focus of the law is online material such as pornography and suicide, it also requires websites to age-gate content with bullying, serious violence, \u201cdangerous stunts\u201d and \u201cexposure to harmful substances.\u201d That has covered relatively mainstream services such as Spotify and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox gaming system.",
      "Companies that don\u2019t comply face potential fines of up to 10% of their global revenue, which for the biggest companies could be billions of dollars. The British regulator Ofcom, short for Office of Communications, says companies must use \u201chighly effective age assurance\u201d to restrict the riskiest types of content.",
      "And the U.K. has not been adamant that it won\u2019t allow international borders to stymie enforcement. Ofcom says it plans to apply the law to services with \u201ca significant number\u201d of U.K. users, services where U.K. users \u201care a target market\u201d and services that are \u201ccapable of being accessed\u201d by U.K. users with a \u201cmaterial risk of significant harm\u201d to such users.",
      "The law appears to retain strong support among the British public. About 69% said they supported the new rules in a YouGov poll taken after implementation began, and 46% said they supported it \u201cstrongly.\u201d But 52% said they do not think the law will be very effective at preventing minors from accessing pornography.",
      "The law was passed during a previous, Conservative-led government and took effect under the current, Labour-led government.",
      "But the far-right party Reform U.K. is pushing for a repeal of the law. Party leader Nigel Farage, a former member of Parliament, has called it \u201cstate suppression of genuine free speech,\u201d and his party is running high in polls.",
      "\u201cMillions of people have noticed that what they\u2019re getting on their feeds is different to what it was,\u201d Farage said at a recent news conference.",
      "Farage also met with visiting members of Congress last week, and the talks turned heated with Farage and Democrats exchanging insults, according to Politico, although the dispute appeared to be more about Trump\u2019s free speech restrictions than about the U.K. law.",
      "Most U.S.-based tech companies say they are complying with the new law. Microsoft said in a blog post that Xbox users in the U.K. would begin seeing notifications \u201cencouraging them to verify their age\u201d as a \u201cone-time process,\u201d with actual enforcement starting next year. If users don\u2019t comply, Microsoft warned, they\u2019ll lose access to social features of Xbox but will still be able to play games.",
      "Discord said it was implementing new default settings for all U.K. users, in effect treating everyone like a minor with heavy content filtering unless they verify that they\u2019re adults. Discord says users can choose to verify their age either with a face scan or an ID upload.",
      "Elon Musk\u2019s X has also restricted posts, including information about the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, according to the BBC. X and Musk did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "But a few services are not complying. The far-right social media site Gab, which allows white supremacist views and other extremist content, said in a notice on its website that it had received notices from Ofcom and, rather than comply, decided to block the entire U.K. from accessing its site. The company said in the notice: \u201cWe refuse to comply with this tyranny.\u201d",
      "Preston Byrne, a U.S. lawyer who specializes in technology issues, has said on X that he plans to file a lawsuit soon on behalf of an unnamed client seeking to quash possible enforcement of the British law within the United States.",
      "The subject has been simmering for months ahead of the law\u2019s implementation, and it came up in February when British Prime Minister Keir Starmer visited the White House.",
      "In an Oval Office meeting, a reporter asked Trump what he thought of the U.K. approach to free speech, and Trump tossed the question to Vance, who expressed concern.",
      "\u201cWe do have, of course, a special relationship with our friends in the U.K. and also with some of our European allies. But we also know that there have been infringements on free speech that actually affect not just the British \u2014 of course, what the British do in their own country is up to them \u2014 but also affect American technology companies and, by extension, American citizens,\u201d he said.",
      "Starmer defended his government\u2019s approach.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom, and it will last for a very, very long time. Certainly, we wouldn\u2019t want to reach across U.S. systems and we don\u2019t, and that\u2019s absolutely right,\u201d he said.",
      "British Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy later said the U.K. would not make any changes to the Online Safety Act as part of trade negotiations with the Trump administration.",
      "American privacy advocates are watching the debate play out with alarm, concerned that similar age verification laws \u2014 like new state laws targeting the Apple and Google app stores \u2014 would upend the internet closer to home.",
      "\u201cYoung people should be able to access information, speak to each other and to the world, play games, and express themselves online without the government making decisions about what speech is permissible,\u201d wrote Paige Collings, a senior speech and privacy activist at the San Francisco-based Electronic Frontier Foundation, in a blog post Tuesday."

      "Putin, who has ruthlessly secured unprecedented power at home, has seen his army finally eke out a slight advantage on the battlefield in Ukraine after years of brutal back-and-forth fighting.",
      "Now, invited in from the diplomatic cold, the Russian leader headed for Anchorage full of praise for his American counterpart\u2019s \u201cenergetic and sincere efforts\u201d ahead of the talks, which will see him set foot on U.S. soil for the first time in a decade.",
      "For his part Trump warned en route to Alaska that Putin would face \u201cvery severe\u201d economic consequences unless he agreed to stop the war.",
      "Asked about overnight attacks on Ukraine, Trump told reporters Friday aboard Air Force One that this ongoing aggression actually hurts his Russian counterpart. \u201cHe thinks that makes him \u2014 gives him strength in negotiating. I think it hurts him, but I\u2019ll be talking to him about it later,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Follow live updates here",
      "But many observers see Putin as likely to enter the talks feeling emboldened.",
      "\u201cPutin has scored a success already by being invited to meet Trump on U.S. soil,\u201d said  Keir Giles, a senior fellow at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.",
      "\u201cTrump has facilitated Putin\u2019s acceptance back into international diplomacy, despite the fact that he ought to be finding it difficult to travel, given his status as an internationally wanted war criminal,\u201d Giles told NBC News in a telephone interview Thursday, pointing to the arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court in March 2023.",
      "On the streets of Moscow, there was also a sense of positivity about the meeting and confidence in their leader, who has continually served as president or prime minister of Russia since 1999.",
      "Pavel Grebenyuk, 45, told NBC News the summit with Trump was important because \u201cthere should be a connection between Russia and America, two of the most leading powers,\u201d and \u201cthere should remain a dialogue.\u201d",
      "But Grebenyuk, who said he worked at a window manufacturing factory, added that he thought it was \u201cunlikely anything will change dramatically,\u201d after the talks to end the war, which entered its fourth year in February.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t expect anything,\u201d he said.",
      "Elena Ionova, a soloist with Moscow\u2019s Operetta Theatre, also said that it was \u201cgood that this meeting is happening,\u201d but that she didn\u2019t \u201ctrust people on the other side.\u201d She added that she was \u201cworried about Putin\u2019s fate.\u201d",
      "\u201cOf course, we would all like for all of this to end and end, at least, without any major catastrophes,\u201d she said.",

      "A recent survey by the independent pollster Levada Center showed that the level of support for Putin's military campaign in Ukraine remained high at 75% in Russia, but that nearly two-thirds of respondents supported peace talks.",
      "The venue for those talks is itself significant.",
      "Trump and Putin will meet at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a  military base that was crucial to U.S. efforts to counter the then-Soviet Union during the Cold War.",
      "It sits just outside Anchorage, the largest city in the territory,   which the U.S. bought from Russia for $7.2 million in 1867 \u2014 a sale that has since been viewed as na\u00efve by Russians after Alaska was found to contain vast natural resources.",
      "Putin aide Yuri Ushakov signaled Thursday that while the primary focus of the summit would be Ukraine, economic ties between the two nations would also be on the agenda. Putin hinted that a nuclear arms control treaty may also be discussed.",
      "Ukraine and its allies may fear Putin offering Trump other incentives to distract from his hard-line position on the war he launched by invading his neighbor.",
      "\u201cStripped of political narratives and competing interests, and based on Putin\u2019s own statements and actions, his core demands have not changed,\u201d said Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, a Berlin-based think tank.",
      "Those demands have previously included Ukraine ceding all the land that Putin claims to have annexed and accepting permanent neutrality, with a ban on Ukraine ever joining NATO. Putin claims four Ukrainian regions \u2014 Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson \u2014 as well as the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which he annexed in 2014, although Russian forces do not fully control all of the territory in each region.",
      "Zelenskyy and Ukrainian officials have long said they would not concede any territory that Russia illegally annexed. Ukraine has also insisted that any agreement must include \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d from its allies so that Moscow is not able to launch future aggression.",
      "Stanovaya added that she thought Putin intended to \u201cpropose to Trump that the war be brought to an end, and will press the point that he genuinely wishes it to stop.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis main objective is to persuade Trump that Europe and the current Ukrainian leadership are the obstacles to ending the conflict, and that a cessation of hostilities is possible if there are guarantees that Ukraine will not use any pause to rearm,\u201d she said on X, adding that the Russian president \u201cwill strongly promote the idea that the U.S. and Russia are two great nations that should maintain good relations regardless of local conflicts.\u201d",

      "His brother, Andrei, 38, was killed by a Russian artillery strike while fighting to defend Ukraine\u2019s front lines. At the funeral on the eve of the talks in Anchorage \u2014 which Ukraine has not been invited to \u2014 Reshetilov urged Trump not to bend to Vladimir Putin\u2019s demands of more Ukrainian land.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have to compromise with the enemy and give up our beloved land because this enemy won\u2019t stop,\u201d said Reshetilov, 46, as hundreds of Ukrainian flags, each marking the grave of a fallen soldier, flapped in the breeze behind him at this cemetery near the major northeastern city of Kharkiv.",
      "Like many who will not be present in Anchorage, he told NBC News he fears Russia could merely use a ceasefire to \u201creturn even stronger\u201d and attack Ukraine and even other countries in Europe.",
      "\u201cWe know Russia and they never keep agreements,\u201d he added.",
      "These fears are not confined just to Ukrainian hearts but shared by governments, experts and people across Europe and beyond who fear what Trump might agree to with Putin in a bid to resolve a war he once promised the American people he could fix in 24 hours.",
      "Hours before the talks Friday, Trump suggested that he and Putin would discuss territorial swaps between Russia and Ukraine \u2014 despite previously assuring European allies that he wouldn\u2019t.

It\u2019s well past time that President Trump was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize,\u201d she added.",
      "A difference between this term and the last is that now, \u201che actually wants it,\" a senior official in Trump\u2019s first term said about the Nobel Peace Prize, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t just want to talk about it.\u201d",
      "Now comes his best shot. On Friday, Trump will fly to Alaska for a sit-down with Russian President Vladimir Putin aimed at ending a war with Ukraine that has produced close to 1.5 million casualties on both sides.",
      "The odds of a breakthrough are tough, but if Trump brokers a truce on terms that are fair to Ukraine, that would be a diplomatic triumph that eluded both Obama and President Joe Biden.",
      "In the run-up to the summit, the Nobel prize has appeared to be top of mind in Trump's circle. Without prompting, Leavitt  portrayed Trump as deserving of the prize in three out of her four press briefings in July. In prior months, she hadn\u2019t brought up the award.",
      "Trump has posted about the prize a total of seven times on his social media site since his second term began, six of them in June and July. A theme of his is that while he\u2019s earned the accolade, he won\u2019t win it.",
      "\u201cThe president feels that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, but does not think he will get it,\u201d a White House official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cHe has remarked that it will go to someone who writes a book about how Donald Trump thinks rather than Donald Trump himself.\u201d",
      "In a visit to the White House in April, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re was asked about Trump\u2019s prospects of winning the award, announced annually in Oslo.",
      "He didn\u2019t bite.",
      "\u201cOn that prize, that is a committee taking care of that which is completely working on its own terms and I cannot comment on that,\u201d St\u00f8re said.",
      "Trump smiled and looked across the Cabinet Room table at the prime minister: \u201cI like that question,\u201d he said.",
      "The award is solely in the hands of the Nobel selection committee; politicians don\u2019t pick the winner. But Trump has reportedly raised the issue with Norway before. Last month, he called the country\u2019s finance minister, former NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg, to talk tariffs and brought up the peace prize, a Norwegian news outlet wrote Thursday.",
      "The White House official said that the president and Stoltenberg did speak, but could not say that the conversation was focused on the prize. Stoltenberg confirmed in a statement that he spoke to Trump about tariffs but would not go into further details of the call.",
      "Trump is surrounded by reminders of past presidents who\u2019ve won what is arguably humanity\u2019s most prestigious award. Obama, whose portrait hangs in the White House, won it less than a year into his presidency and even he acknowledged at the time that his accomplishments were \u201cslight\u201d in contrast to other Nobel laureates.",
      "Just a few paces from the Oval Office, Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s Nobel Prize is on display, signifying both the challenge and opportunity that Trump faces. Roosevelt won in 1906 for bringing an end to another Russian conflict: a war with Japan.",
      "As much as he aligns himself politically with working Americans, Trump has long been attuned to elite opinion. He takes pride in recounting that his late uncle, John Trump, taught at the acclaimed Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He has described his alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, as \u201cthe hardest school to get into, the best school in the world.\u201d",
      "In announcing the Kennedy Center honorees on Wednesday, Trump said that he had long wanted one for himself. The president now plans to host the Kennedy Center Honors this year, teasing to reporters, \"maybe ... next year we\u2019ll honor Trump.\"",
      "A Nobel Peace Prize would be the ultimate validation.",
      "\"If the Israel-Hamas/Iran and Russia-Ukraine conflicts get resolved, there\u2019s no way that they can\u2019t give President Trump the Nobel Peace Prize,\" O'Brien said.",
      "\u201cThe Nobel committee may not like Trump,\" he added. \"They may not like his personality. They may not like his populism, but if the award has any meaning, they have to give it to him.\u201d",
      "Of course, the Nobel selection committee has its own ideas about what it takes to win. The five-member body appointed by the Norwegian parliament may be weighing other criteria apart from the peace deals the White House has tallied.",
      "In his will, Alfred Nobel stated that the prize should go to those \u201cwho shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations.\u201d",
      "Since Trump took office, some longtime U.S. allies have seen fraternal bonds fray. Trump has rolled out stiff tariffs in pursuit of an \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda meant to create more jobs at home. He stunned various world capitals with his calls for acquiring Greenland, Canada and the Panama Canal.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s desire to win the Nobel Peace Prize has become something of a joke in foreign capitals,\u201d a former British diplomat said. \u201cHis claims to Canada, Panama, Greenland, etc., as well as tariff wars and the assaults on America\u2019s democratic institutions, incline governments in the opposite direction.\u201d",
      "What happens in the Nobel committee\u2019s closed-door deliberations is a closely guarded secret. The panel accepts nominations through the end of January and announces the winner in October. It waits 50 years before revealing even a list of nominees.",
      "Handicapping possible winners of the 2025 prize, a Norwegian think tank didn\u2019t mention Trump\u2019s name. The handful of front-runners the group cited included \u201cSudan\u2019s Emergency Response Rooms,\u201d the prime minister of Qatar, the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, and the Women\u2019s International League for Peace & Freedom.",
      "It\u2019s far from clear that the Nobel committee is susceptible to persuasion. Pressure, publicity and coalition-building work in politics, the arena Trump knows well. But the Nobel committee is insulated from that world.",
      "The prize \u201cis not something you campaign for,\u201d a Western diplomat said. \u201cThis is a decision made by people who are independent and have their own point of view. You can\u2019t buy it. Norway doesn\u2019t need the money.\u201d",
      "Last week, Trump held a meeting at the White House with the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan to mark a rapprochement between the two countries. Questioned by a reporter, both leaders plumped for Trump\u2019s Nobel candidacy.",
      "Nikol Pashinyan, prime minister of Armenia, said, \u201cWe will promote for that.\u201d",
      "Turning to Trump, he said, \u201cHopefully you will invite us\u201d to the award ceremony.",
      "\u201cFront row,\u201d Trump said."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 The marathon national security trial of pro-democracy activist Jimmy Lai is nearing conclusion in Hong Kong as President Donald Trump vowed to \u201cdo everything I can to save\u201d the media tycoon from what critics say is political persecution by Chinese authorities.",
      "Closing arguments in the landmark trial, which began in December 2023, were set to begin this week after a five-month break following the end of Lai\u2019s testimony in March. But they were postponed twice on Thursday and Friday, first due to a severe thunderstorm that closed courts and then to allow time for Lai, who has complained of heart palpitations, to receive medication and a portable heart monitor.",
      "They are expected to resume Monday and last about 10 days, with a verdict by the three handpicked judges coming in October at the earliest.",
      "Lai, a 77-year-old British citizen who is one of the Chinese territory\u2019s most prominent democrats, was arrested in August 2020 under a Beijing-imposed national security law over his role in mass anti-government protests in 2019 that sometimes turned violent. He has since spent almost 1,700 days in solitary confinement, during which time his son says his health has declined significantly.",
      "Lai has pleaded not guilty to two national security charges of conspiring to collude with foreign forces and a third count under colonial-era legislation of publishing seditious materials in Apple Daily, his now-defunct pro-democracy tabloid. If convicted, he could face life in prison.",
      "The U.S. and other governments have criticized the case as politically motivated and called for Lai\u2019s immediate release. Trump said Thursday that he would \u201cdo everything I can to save him\u201d in talks with Chinese officials, even if Chinese President Xi Jinping \u201cwould not be exactly thrilled\u201d to let him go.",
      "Trump appeared to be softening a claim he made about Lai last year, when he said on a podcast that \u201c100%, I\u2019ll get him out\u201d of China and that it would be \u201cso easy.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t say 100% I\u2019d save him. I said 100% I\u2019m going to be bringing it up. And I\u2019ve already brought it up,\u201d Trump said Thursday in an interview with Fox News Radio, without giving details.",
      "The government of Hong Kong, a former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997, said Wednesday that Lai was receiving a fair trial and accused \u201cexternal forces\u201d of trying to interfere in Hong Kong courts. Hong Kong and mainland Chinese officials say the national security law and related local legislation were necessary to restore stability in the international financial hub after the protests.",
      "With a verdict still weeks away, the hearing on Friday drew fewer people than rulings and sentencings in recent cases such as the sedition trial against two Stand News journalists or the subversion trial against 47 pro-democracy politicians and activists.",
      "But members of the public still lined up hours before the hearing amid heavy police presence to secure seats in the main courtroom and catch a glimpse of Lai.",
      "First in line was local activist Lui Yuk-lin, who arrived before 1 a.m. and said she was concerned about Lai\u2019s health.",
      "\u201cHe used to have a big belly. But after many years in jail, it\u2019s now gone,\u201d said Lui, who wore a T-shirt bearing the American flag and the words \u201cLand of the Free.\u201d",
      "Members of the public gallery waved at Lai, wearing a white windbreaker and thick-rimmed black glasses, as he appeared in the courtroom Friday in a glassed-in area surrounded by four guards. Lai smiled and waved back at supporters.",
      "Western diplomats were also in attendance.",
      "During his 52 days of testimony, Lai denied allegations that he lobbied the U.S. to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and China. He said that while Apple Daily held anti-communist views, he did not use the media outlet to promote Hong Kong independence.",
      "Lai also referred to himself as a \u201cpolitical prisoner\u201d at least twice during questioning, drawing fierce rebukes from the bench.",
      "Lai has already been convicted in three separate cases related to unauthorized assembly and is serving five years and nine months in prison over a 2022 fraud conviction, cases that have also been criticized as politically motivated.",
      "Spectators waved again as Lai exited the courtroom on Friday.",
      "\u201cI hope his family can stay strong and bold,\u201d Lui said. \u201cWe support him.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Russia's Vladimir Putin sounded positive Thursday on the eve of  his talks with President Donald Trump in Alaska, saying he believed the American leader was making \"quite energetic and sincere efforts\" toward peace in Ukraine.",
      "A day ahead of their summit, Putin convened a meeting of advisers to inform them \"about how the negotiation process on the Ukrainian crisis is going,\" the Kremlin said in a readout translated by NBC News.",
      "The Russian leader said the Trump administration is making \"quite energetic and sincere efforts to stop the fighting, stop the crisis and reach agreements that are of interest to all parties involved in this conflict.\"",
      "Those efforts are intended \"to create long-term conditions of peace between our countries and in Europe, and in the world as a whole,\" he added, particularly if the negotiations are extended to cover strategic offensive weapons treaties.",
      "This suggests that a deal on nuclear arms control could be part of the talks. Russia suspended its participation in the New START \"reduction in strategic offensive arms\" agreement in 2023.",
      "Earlier Thursday, Putin aide Yuri Ushakov said the summit would start with head-to-head talks between Trump, Putin and their translators at 11:30 a.m. local time (3:30 p.m. ET) and would be followed by a joint news conference. The White House later confirmed this.",
      "Trump \"wants to exhaust all options to try to bring this war to a peaceful resolution,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News.",
      "The top-level Russian delegation will include Putin, Ushakov, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Defense Minister Andrei Belousov, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov and Putin's longtime friend and investment envoy Kirill Dmitriev, Ushakov said on a call with journalists in Moscow.",
      "The primary topic of the meeting will be Ukraine, he said, but he added that he expected the \"huge, and unfortunately hitherto untapped, potential\" of economic ties between the U.S. and Russia would also be discussed.",
      "As well as Putin's openly stated goal of subjugating Ukraine, he also wants to end Russia's exile from the Western financial system following economic sanctions imposed by Washington, the European Union and others. Trump has not yet lifted these punishments but has expressed a desire to end Russia's economic pariah status.",
      "NBC News asked Trump in a press gaggle on Thursday whether he would offer Putin access to rare earth minerals as an incentive to end the war with Ukraine.",
      "\"We\u2019re going to see what happens with our meeting. We have a big meeting. It\u2019s going to be, I think, very important for Russia, and it\u2019s going to be very important for us,\" Trump said, without offering additional details. He later added that the earth minerals are \u201cvery unimportant\u201d compared to \u201ctrying to save lives.\u201d",
      "The talks come as Ukraine marked a grim new record with 286 civilians killed and 1,388 injured in July, according to the United Nations.",
      "\u201cFor the second month in a row, the number of civilian casualties in Ukraine hits a new three-year high,\u201d Danielle Bell, the head of the U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU), said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cOnly the first three months after the Russian Federation launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine saw more killed and injured than in this past month.\u201d",
      "The Trump-Putin summit has prompted howls of dismay and anxiety across Ukraine and Europe, which have not been invited to the talks and fear what the American president may agree to with his Russian counterpart about the conflict raging on their continent.",
      "They have been confined to their own diplomatic scrambling, including dozens of calls between Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other leaders, culminating in a video call between these parties and Trump himself Wednesday.",
      "Zelenskyy said that Putin \u201cis bluffing\u201d in saying he wants peace.",
      "On Thursday, the Ukrainian leader flew to London and met his British counterpart, Prime Minister Keir Starmer, for what both called a \"productive meeting.\" As well as the prospect of Britain financing the small drones that have become central to Ukraine's battlefield defense, the pair discussed the Alaska talks, \"which present a viable chance to make progress as long as Putin takes action to prove he is serious about peace,\" a spokesperson from Starmer's office, No. 10 Downing St., said in a statement.",
      "After Wednesday's call with Zelenskyy, Starmer and others, Trump said he had assured them that there would be \"very severe consequences\" \u2014 without elaborating what those might be \u2014 if Putin did not agree to end the war during their sit-down discussion.",

Some of the European leaders were left with the impression from the call that Trump is not optimistic about the results of his meeting with Putin, they added.",
      "The call on Wednesday took place just days ahead of Trump\u2019s meeting with Putin, which is planned for Friday. European and Ukrainian officials have been nervous about the president\u2019s meeting with the Russian leader since he announced it last week. Among their concerns is that Trump and Putin might agree to the parameters of a peace deal, including territorial divisions, and then try to pressure Ukraine to agree to it. Trump\u2019s comments last week that there would \"be some land swapping\u201d between Russia and Ukraine, in particular, put Zelenskyy and European leaders on edge.",
      "But the two European officials and three other people briefed on Wednesday\u2019s call said all the leaders agreed that Ukraine must be included in negotiations and should be the one to decide what territorial concessions it might be willing to make. They also said the leaders were united in their belief that if Putin does not agree to a ceasefire, Trump will likely levy new sanctions on Russia.",
      "Two additional people familiar with Wednesday\u2019s call said European leaders left feeling positive about Trump\u2019s plans for his meeting with Putin. One of them said achieving a ceasefire is expected to be the priority for Trump in the meeting. The other person expressed confidence that Ukrainian territory would not be negotiated without Ukraine.",
      "A European official said there was still concern that the president could shift his position yet again once he is in the room with Putin, especially as he has so far proven reluctant to put concrete pressure on Russia and follow through on threats of additional sanctions.",
      "\u201cSometimes these positions change and get revised in a matter of hours,\u201d one European official said.",
      "European governments and Ukraine are also anxious about how the aftermath of the meeting would be handled, that European official said, and whether the details of what was discussed or agreed would be clearly explained or addressed in a joint statement.",
      "In response to a request for comment, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement: \"The White House does not discuss details of the President\u2019s private diplomatic conversations. However, President Trump has been clear that he wants to end this war and stop the killing, and Friday\u2019s meeting with President Putin will serve as an important moment in this process.\u201d",
      "Trump said Wednesday after the call that it was \u201cvery good\u201d and suggested that another meeting involving Zelenskyy could quickly follow his sit-down with Putin.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a very good chance that we\u2019re going to have a second meeting, which will be more productive than the first, because the first is I\u2019m going to find out where we are and what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cI would like to do it almost immediately, and we\u2019ll have a quick second meeting between President Putin and President Zelenskyy and myself, if they\u2019d like to have me there.\u201d",
      "The president also said Russia will face \u201csevere consequences\u201d if Putin doesn\u2019t agree to end the war.",
      "Vice President JD Vance assured Zelenskyy and European allies on the call that the U.S. would not negotiate with Russia about a solution for the war in Ukraine without Ukraine or without Europe, according to two German government officials involved.",
      "Vance said afterward during remarks to U.S. troops at RAF Fairford in the U.K. that \u201cone of our most important shared security goals in Europe\u201d is ending the war in Ukraine."

      "At trial, the victim testified that Alahverdian quickly became controlling and mean after she bought their rings and lent him money for rent. When she removed the ring and told him their relationship was over, they fought and he eventually assaulted her, she testified.",

      "Alahverdian pleaded no contest to misdemeanor domestic assault and was sentenced to probation.",
      "In Ohio in 2008, a woman whom Alahverdian met on MySpace accused him of sexually assaulting her while walking to class at a local community college. He denied the allegation and was charged with public indecency and sexual imposition, a misdemeanor crime indicating sexual contact against a person\u2019s will.",
      "After a trial, Alahverdian was fined and ordered to register as a sex offender.",
      "The second Utah case, also from 2008, involves a woman who said they\u2019d started dating after they met on MySpace. An affidavit in support of an arrest warrant shows that she told authorities that she broke it off after he became increasingly aggressive and borrowed money without paying her back.",
      "On Sept. 13 of that year, she said she went to his home after he said he\u2019d pay her back, according to the affidavit. He instead raped her, according to the document.",
      "A sexual assault kit was completed the next day, authorities have said, but a backlog in testing meant that Alahverdian was not identified as a suspect until a decade later. Alahverdian has pleaded not guilty in that case."

There is growing alarm in Europe that the leaders from Washington and Moscow could emerge with an agreement disastrous for Ukraine and the continent\u2019s vulnerability to future Russian attack.",
      "In a week of frantic diplomacy, the virtual summit included Trump alongside the leaders of Ukraine, Germany, France, Britain, Finland, Italy, Poland, the European Union and NATO, according to the German government, which has organized the call.",
      "Zelenskyy attended the meeting in person, having touched down by helicopter in Berlin where he was greeted by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. It is the latest of what Zelenskyy says have been more than 30 conversations with world leaders this week.",
      "After the digital gaggle, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz told a news conference in Berlin that the meeting had been \u201cconstructive.\u201d",
      "European leaders had \u201cmade it clear that Ukraine had to be at the table if there were any follow up meetings,\u201d and that a ceasefire had to be implemented before those talks took please, he said.",
      "Ukraine was \u201cwilling to discuss territorial questions,\u201d with Russia but \u201cillegal recognition of Russian occupied territory is not part of the discussion,\u201d he added. \u201cBorders might not be changed by violence.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy accused Putin of \"bluffing\" about his desire to end the war, saying that his Russian counterpart did care about the sanctions that were \"hurting\" his county's economy.",
      "He added that he wanted a meeting with both Trump and Putin and no talks about Ukraine should exclude Kyiv. \"Everything that concerns Ukraine should be discussed exclusively with Ukraine,\" he said.",
      "The White House is yet to comment, but ahead of the talks Trump described his European colleagues as \u201cgreat people who want to see a deal done\u201d in a Truth Social post.",
      "Most European leaders fear that Russia will not stop at the 20% of Ukraine it currently occupies following its 2022 full-scale invasion, and instead may use this land grab from which to launch further attacks on Moscow\u2019s former Soviet vassals. Putin has described the fall of the USSR as a historic tragedy, and believes the Baltic states, which are now members of the E.U. and NATO, should be brought back within his sphere of influence.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s calls are a show of European unity behind Ukraine and other Russian neighbors who fear its next move. E.U. leaders will hold separate telephone discussions before and after the call with Trump, the latter including Canada, indicating the level of coordination between them.",
      "European powers say that there must be a ceasefire before peace talks can begin \u2014 something rejected by Russia \u2014 and that negotiations cannot happen without Ukraine. They argue Ukraine must have \u201csecurity guarantees,\u201d perhaps in the form of Western peacekeepers, so the Kremlin does not use the pause to regroup and attack again."

    "summary": "Alternative for Germany has joined France's National Rally and Reform U.K. in becoming the most popular party in its country, according to polls.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 For the first time in modern history, far-right and populist parties are simultaneously topping the polls in Europe\u2019s three main economies of Germany, France and Britain.",
      "A poll Tuesday showed Alternative for Germany \u2014 which is under surveillance by the country\u2019s intelligence services over suspected extremism \u2014 is now the most favored by voters. The survey by broadcaster RTL put the AfD at 26%, ahead of the ruling Christian Democrats at 24%.",
      "This is a high watermark for the European far right, a once fringe movement whose virulently anti-immigration, anti-Islam and culture-war politics were shunned by the mainstream just a decade ago. Today, these parties have developed deep ties with President Donald Trump and his Republican allies, who openly cite nationalists such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n as inspirations on policy and tactics.",
      "For years, France\u2019s National Rally has consistently led polls ahead of the country\u2019s next presidential election in 2027. And Britain\u2019s Reform U.K., led by Trump ally and friend Nigel Farage, has since April topped most polls there.",
      "Far-right parties have been elected over the past few years into the governments of Italy, Hungary and elsewhere. The center right and the center left have hemorrhaged votes amid high inflation, fears over immigration and collapsing faith in institutions \u2014 all familiar issues in America, too.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s polling milestone is \u201ca sign of the power of populism, disinformation and the failure of established parties to understand what is happening,\u201d said Nic Cheeseman, a professor of democracy and international development at England\u2019s University of Birmingham.",
      "Though the far right has been making gains for the past decade, Cheeseman believes the polls showing the far right leading Europe\u2019s top three economies is \u201ca first \u2014 at least in modern times.\u201d",
      "There is no guarantee that London, Berlin and Paris will be ruled by far-right parties; these countries\u2019 next elections are not until 2029, 2029 and 2027 respectively. These groups are all polling in the 20s and 30s percentage-wise, enough to lead polls in Europe\u2019s multiparty systems but not enough to govern alone outside of a coalition.",
      "Most of Europe\u2019s politicians on this former fringe reject the \u201cfar right\u201d label, with its historical connotations of the Nazism that marauded the continent 80 years ago. Many scholars say these parties nevertheless fit the academic model, defined by nativism \u2014 the idea that perceived \u201cnon-native\u201d groups threaten their social fabric \u2014 and harsh punishments for criminality.",
      "The roots of the far-right surge lie in the world financial crisis of 2008, which prompted government to cut budgets for public services and lowered living standards, some experts say, compounded by the Arab Spring of 2011 that birthed civil war in Syria and a mass refugee crisis in Europe four years later.",
      "More recent societal stressors such as the coronavirus pandemic and war in Ukraine have further increased the allure of populism, according to Hans-Jakob Schindler, the senior director of the Counter Extremism Project, a nonprofit international group. But populist parties in Europe have also harnessed social media more powerfully than their more centrist opponents, he said.",
      "\u201cThey are masters of using social media much better than any of the more established parties,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you have easy solutions to complex problems\u201d \u2014 as he says populist parties do \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s easier to communicate than complex political issues that the actual parties, who do politics rather than just doing populism, will have to deal with.\u201d"

      "U.N.-backed investigators say they have found significant evidence of \u201csystematic torture\u201d at Myanmar detention centers, where the military government is holding children as young as 2 years old as proxies for their parents.",
      "The Southeast Asian nation of about 54 million people has been mired in turmoil since 2021, when democratically elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi was overthrown by the military. The coup set off mass protests across the country that were violently suppressed, followed by a nationwide armed resistance movement that has displaced millions of people.",
      "Investigators said Tuesday there was evidence of \u201ca continued increase in the frequency and brutality of atrocities\u201d across Myanmar, with war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by government security forces and affiliated militias as well as armed opposition groups.",
      "That includes an increase in crimes committed against those in detention, many of whom are being held without due process, said Nicholas Koumjian, head of the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve documented torture against those in detention, including beatings and electric shocks, strangulations, pulling out fingernails, gang rape, burning of sexual body parts and other forms of sexual violence,\u201d he told reporters in Geneva as his team released its annual report.",
      "Koumjian said investigators had seen evidence that children as young as 2 years old were being detained, often in place of their parents if they are accused of being associated with the opposition and cannot be found.",
      "\u201cSome of the detained children have been subjected to torture, ill-treatment or sexual and gender-based crimes,\u201d the report says.",
      "Myanmar\u2019s military government has detained about 30,000 people in the past four years, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, an advocacy group that tracks arrests in the country.",
      "The Myanmar military could not be reached for comment. It has denied any atrocities are taking place and blamed \u201cterrorists\u201d for unrest.",
      "The 16-page report, which covers a one-year period up to June 30, draws on more than 1,300 sources, including nearly 600 eyewitness testimonies, photographs, videos, documents, maps and forensic evidence.",
      "Koumjian said the Myanmar military appeared to be increasing its use of airstrikes as it loses control of more territory. They continued even after a devastating earthquake in March, he said, often against \u201cblatantly civilian targets\u201d such as schools, hospitals and places of worship.",
      "\u201cOften there\u2019s no military target that we can identify anywhere in the area that could have been the intent of the airstrike,\u201d he said.",
      "Koumjian said investigators were working to determine how the airstrikes were ordered, who was in the chain of command and who flew the planes.",
      "In addition, he said, there is growing evidence of crimes committed by opposition forces, including summary executions of captured fighters from other armed groups.",
      "The team is also still investigating the 2017 Rohingya refugee crisis, during which more than 700,000 people from the mostly Muslim ethnic minority fled a military crackdown in Buddhist-majority Myanmar for neighboring Bangladesh. Along with other ethnic groups, the remaining Rohingya population is again in danger as they are persecuted by the Arakan Army rebel group that now has effective control of Rakhine state, their ancestral home.",
      "Koumjian said investigators had made progress in identifying some of the people responsible for crimes in Myanmar, including commanders overseeing detention facilities, and that \u201cwe stand ready to support any jurisdictions willing and able to prosecute these crimes.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are working towards the day when the perpetrators will have to answer for their actions in a court of law,\u201d he said in a news release.",
      "The work of Myanmar investigators is already being used in cases before the International Criminal Court (ICC), the International Court of Justice and in Argentina. In November, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the head of Myanmar\u2019s military government, for crimes committed against the Rohingya.",
      "Min Aung Hlaing tightened his grip on power last month in an administrative restructuring as the junta said it was ending the state of emergency it declared in 2021.

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration released its new, drastically scaled-down version of the State Department\u2019s annual human rights report after months of delay Tuesday. The administration\u2019s assessment of human rights abuses in some countries, which is one-tenth as long as last year\u2019s report, reaches notably different conclusions and dedicates no sections to abuses against women or LGBTQ people.",
      "The report also places a new focus on restrictions of freedom of expression by U.S. adversaries and allies alike.",
      "Amanda Klasing, Amnesty International USA\u2019s national director of government relations and advocacy, said the Trump administration had engaged in highly selective documentation of human rights abuses in certain countries.",
      "\u201cWe have criticized past reports when warranted, but have never seen reports quite like this,\u201d Klasing said in a statement. \u201cNever before have the reports gone this far in prioritizing an administration\u2019s political agenda over a consistent and truthful accounting of human rights violations around the world \u2014 softening criticism in some countries while ignoring violations in others.\u201d",
      "State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce defended the administration\u2019s version of the report, which U.S. diplomats have compiled for nearly 50 years under a congressional mandate to measure countries\u2019 adherence to internationally recognized human rights.",
      "\u201cThe Human Rights Report has been restructured in a way that removes redundancy, increases report readability, and is responsive to the legislative mandates that underpin the report, rather than an expansive list of politically biased demands and assertions,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cIndividual reports are more readable, objective, true to their statutory origins, and more useful than ever before.\u201d",
      "Criticism of Europe",
      "In the United Kingdom, France, Germany and other European countries, the Trump administration concluded that the human rights situation \u201cworsened during the year.\u201d The report cited restrictions on freedom of expression, as well as reports of \u201ccrimes, violence, or threats of violence motivated by antisemitism.\u201d",
      "In Germany, the report found \u201climits on the speech of groups it deemed extremist.\u201d In France, the State Department found \u201csome limitations on freedom of speech.\u201d And the assessment listed restrictions on political speech in the U.K. it deemed \u201chateful\u201d or \u201coffensive.\u201d",
      "The concerns were similar to those Vice President JD Vance expressed in a speech to the Munich Security Conference in February. Vance accused European Union leaders of suppressing free speech, particularly that off far-right groups.",
      "Asked by reporters about the Trump administration\u2019s review of visa applicants\u2019 social media accounts, Bruce said: \u201cWe consider freedom of expression to be a foundational component of a functioning democracy. Societies are strengthened by free expression of opinion and government censorship is intolerable in a free society.\u201d",
      "Support for Brazil's former president",
      "The human rights situation also declined in Brazil last year, the Trump administration concluded, citing court rulings that it called \u201cbroad and disproportionate action to undermine freedom of speech and internet freedom.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe government undermined democratic debate by restricting access to online content deemed to \u2018undermine democracy,\u2019 disproportionately suppressing the speech of supporters of former president Jair Bolsonaro as well as journalists and elected politicians, often in secret proceedings that lacked due process guarantees,\u201d the report says.",
      "Bolsonaro is currently on trial for allegedly plotting to assassinate his rivals to remain in office despite his loss in the 2022 election.",
      "The report also criticizes Supreme Federal Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who has overseen Bolsonaro\u2019s court case, saying he \u201cpersonally ordered the suspension of more than 100 user profiles on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), disproportionately suppressing the speech of advocates of former president Jair Bolsonaro.\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently sanctioned de Moraes, revoking U.S. visas for him and members of his family.",
      "Questioning a South African law",
      "The report found the human rights situation had \u201csignificantly worsened\u201d in South Africa, which Trump has repeatedly criticized since he returned to office. That was in sharp contrast with the State Department human rights report the Biden administration issued last year, which found no significant changes in human rights in South Africa.",
      "The report called the Expropriation Act, a law that attempts to address the disparity in land ownership between white and Black South Africans, \u201ca substantially worrying step towards land expropriation of Afrikaners and further abuses against racial minorities in the country.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has publicly decried the law, which allows the South African government to expropriate land \u2014 in some cases without compensation \u2014 in instances where it is unused or there is a public interest in its redistribution. Earlier this year, the administration resettled 59 white South Africans as refugees in the United States as it blocked refugee admissions from almost all other countries.",
      "\u201cThe government did not take credible steps to investigate, prosecute, and punish officials who committed human rights abuses,\u201d the report said, \u201cincluding inflammatory racial rhetoric against Afrikaners and other racial minorities, or violence against racial minorities.\u201d",
      "No 'significant' abuses in El Salvador",
      "The report said that in El Salvador, which imprisoned hundreds of migrants from the United States at the request of the Trump administration, there were \u201cno credible reports of significant human rights abuses.\u201d",
      "But several Venezuelan migrants who had been imprisoned in El Salvador\u2019s notorious CECOT prison told NBC News they had experienced physical and psychological torture. One man said he was sexually assaulted.",
      "The Biden administration\u2019s human rights report on El Salvador last year was four times longer than the Trump administration\u2019s. It listed several significant human rights issues in the country, including credible reports of \u201cunlawful or arbitrary killings; enforced disappearance; torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by security forces and harsh and life-threatening prison conditions.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s report also removed the section on Indigenous peoples and made no mention of elections or political participation in El Salvador.",
      "Shorter passages on Israel, the West Bank and Gaza",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s reports on Israel, the West Bank and Gaza were also dramatically shorter and had significantly less documentation of abuses by the Israeli government, the Palestinian Authority and Hamas than the Biden administration reports did last year.",
      "In assessing Israel, the Trump administration cited reports of arbitrary or unlawful killings, enforced disappearance and degrading treatment of Palestinians by Israeli officials but emphasized that they resulted from the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack by Hamas. The State Department\u2019s findings also concluded that the Israeli government \u201ctook several credible steps to identify officials who committed human rights abuses, with multiple trials pending at year\u2019s end.\u201d",
      "The report listed significant human rights abuses by the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, including \u201carbitrary or unlawful killings; torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; arbitrary arrest or detention; serious restrictions on freedom of expression and trafficking in persons, including forced labor; and existence of the worst forms of child labor.\u201d",
      "The report also included a detailed description of abuses by Hamas in Gaza, including, \u201cunlawful killings, severe physical abuses and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment.\u201d",
      "Regarding human rights abuses by Israeli security forces in the West Bank and Gaza, the report said simply that \u201cthere have been reports of arbitrary or unlawful killings; and serious restrictions on freedom of expression and media freedom.\u201d But it again added that \u201cIsraeli authorities took steps to identify and punish officials or civilians accused of committing human rights abuses.\u201d And it did point out that human rights groups \u201cfrequently criticized authorities for not adequately pursuing investigations and disciplinary actions.\u201d",
      "The report made no direct mention of the Israeli government\u2019s restrictions on humanitarian aid into Gaza or documented reports of starvation among some Palestinians this year. But it did highlight that in the West Bank, incidents of Israeli violence against Palestinians and their property reached their highest daily average figure since the United Nations started recording data in 2005.",
      "War crimes allegations against Russia",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s assessment of human rights in Russia is less than half as long as the same assessment in the Biden administration\u2019s report. Both reports cited allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity and abuses by Russian forces and officials in the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "The assessment also pointed to human rights groups\u2019 concerns domestically, among them that Russian officials used new laws to punish dissent and limit independent expression. It did not dedicate a section to Russian government corruption as the Biden administration did.",
      "The new report said that \u201cRussia\u2019s occupation and purported annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula and four oblasts in eastern Ukraine affected significantly and negatively the human rights situation there.\u201d It also described \u201ccredible reports of politically motivated arrests, detentions, and trials of Ukrainian citizens in Russia, many of whom claimed to have been tortured.\u201d",
      "It also called the deportation of thousands of civilians to Russia, including children, a crime against humanity."

      "\u201cIsrael has facilitated an extraordinary amount of aid to Palestinians in Gaza, in wartime, and that\u2019s really an unprecedented situation,\u201d said Belle Etra Yoeli, spokesperson for the American Jewish Committee, which recently ran a full-page ad in The New York Times with the image of an Israeli hostage who remains in Hamas custody.",
      "\u201cThe Palestinian civilians who have been caught in the crossfire throughout this entire war because of Hamas\u2019 actions should not be suffering,\u201d she added. \u201cIsrael doesn\u2019t want that.\u201d",
      "Nearly 1,400 people have been killed and more than 4,000 have been injured seeking food in Gaza, the United Nations\u2019 Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said last week.",
      "At least 859 people have been killed near sites operated by Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, or GHF, a controversial American- and Israeli-backed organization, the United Nations said.",
      "The foundation's executive director, Johnnie Moore, said Hamas is largely responsible for the killings and dismissed news reports about people dying by Israeli gunfire.",
      "\u201cWe have not seen the Israeli military do anything that remotely aligns with some of these accusations,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt is a quite evident fact that Hamas has killed intentionally probably hundreds of people in proximity not to just our sites, to U.N. distribution sites, as a means of sort of misattributing those attacks either to the IDF or to being in proximity to GHF,\u201d he added, referring to the Israel Defense Forces.",
      "To address escalating concerns over the humanitarian crisis, synagogues across Jewish movements in the United States have organized roundtables with the executive director of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.",
      "At an event with GHF hosted last month by Sinai Temple in Los Angeles, reactions were mixed, according to Sherman, the rabbi, who led the discussion.",
      "Some people were shocked that an organization that has come under so much criticism was allowed to present its case. Others appreciated hearing directly from people on the ground.",
      "\u201cHow do you block evil from your midst while also feeding the hungry and supporting the orphan and widow?\u201d Sherman said after the roundtable, referring to Psalm 146. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s an impossible task, and I give credit to somebody who is at least trying to do that.\u201d",
      "Polling suggests Jewish Americans are divided over Netanyahu\u2019s handling of the war. According to a Pew Research Center report, 53% of Jewish Americans say they lack confidence in his leadership, while 45% say they have confidence. About 6 million Jews live in the United States, or 2% of the population, according to the Pew Research Center.",
      "The poll was conducted in April, before GHF began its operations in Gaza.",
      "Supporters of Netanyahu\u2019s government, including several Jewish American organizations, have said Hamas is spreading misleading information about who is to blame for ongoing violence at aid sites, a claim Hamas has repeatedly denied. They have also criticized detractors for losing focus on the remaining Israeli hostages held captive by Hamas.",
      "\u201cAll of this can just be stopped anytime if Hamas puts down its weapons,\u201d said Orthodox Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights organization that supports Netanyahu\u2019s government.",
      "An emerging concern echoed by several organizations and rabbis is that Netanyahu\u2019s position is not creating a safer Israel or global environment for Jewish people. Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of nonprofit advocacy organization J Street, said the ongoing violence is exposing Israelis and Palestinians to unnecessary bloodshed.",
      "J Street, which supports a two-state solution, opposed Netanyahu years before the war.",
      "\u201cIf you say to people you must be pro-Palestinian or pro-Israel, then we\u2019re condemning ourselves and our kids to a never-ending conflict,\u201d Ben-Ami said Monday.",
      "But according to Rabbi Ari Lev Fornari of Kol Tzedek, a Reconstructionist synagogue in Philadelphia, the war is creating an \u201cexistential rupture\u201d that is pitting friends and family members against one another.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s catastrophic,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re wrestling with the very question \u2018Do we belong to each other?\u2019\u201d",
      "Fornari was among more than 40 people arrested outside Trump Tower in a rally organized by IfNotNow, a group that opposes the war in Gaza Strip, in New York City earlier this month as they shouted for the United States to stop arming Israel and feed Gaza. He was arrested for investigation of blocking traffic and obstruction, his third arrest since the war started on Oct. 7, 2023, he said.",
      "Some posters and signs displayed outside Trump Tower referred to an ancient maxim about the moral obligation to speak out against injustice, Fornari said.",
      "\u201cIt says anyone who has the power to speak out and chooses not to do so is responsible for it,\u201d he said.",
      "Rabbi Jill Jacobs, the CEO of T\u2019ruah, a rabbinic human rights organization, said she supported Israel\u2019s military response to Hamas\u2019 terrorist attack in 2023, which killed 1,200 people and led to the taking of 250 hostages. The strike, the worst one-day attack on Jews since the Holocaust, shocked the world.",
      "Since then, more than 61,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, and much of the territory has been destroyed.",
      "Jacobs began questioning Netanyahu\u2019s strategy as more and more civilians in Gaza were killed, she said. In July, she denounced American Jewish leaders who had not spoken out against the humanitarian crisis unfolding thousands of miles away.",
      "\u201cPrivately, Jewish lay leaders are anguished over Gaza. Publicly, they fear being labeled antisemitic,\u201d she wrote in an opinion column in The Forward, a Jewish American newspaper.",
      "Jacobs has been called antisemitic by other Jewish people who support Netanyahu and shunned by legacy Jewish organizations, she said. Some of it, she said, comes from a legitimate fear of prejudice.",
      "In May, two Israeli Embassy staffers were killed outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., and a Colorado pro-Israeli hostages group was attacked with two Molotov cocktails in June. There have also been reports of anti-Jewish slurs and signs at college campuses and pro-Palestinian protests across the country.",
      "The cultural fallout has been playing out in living rooms and across kitchen tables. Sonya Meyerson-Knox, a spokesperson for the anti-Zionist group Jewish Voice for Peace, which has opposed the war since 2023, said a member was uninvited to Shabbat family dinners because of differing opinions about the war.",
      "The group was suspended from several campuses, including Columbia University\u2019s, over allegations it intimidated Jewish students and made them feel unsafe during pro-Palestinian protests last year. Jewish Voice for Peace maintains that its views are not antisemitic.",
      "\u201cIt is not unique in Jewish history for Jews to be in fierce disagreement with each other,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is unique is that there seems to be an effort to weaponize one-half of our community against the other.\u201d"
