      "NAPLES, Italy -- Hundreds of once-missing artifacts, hunted down over decades by a special police unit, have been unveiled for the first time in the National Archaeological Museum of Naples, in southern Italy.",
      "In its vaults, the museum preserves 15,000 artifacts seized or confiscated from the black market over the years by a police unit focused on the protection of cultural heritage. It is the loot of raiders who for decades have targeted sites from classical antiquity in southern Italy, such as Pompeii and Herculaneum. Some even used underwater metal detectors, GPS, sonar and drones to extract treasures from the shipwrecks and archaeological sites submerged in the Mediterranean Sea.",
      "From its repository, the museum selected 600 pieces to display for visitors. Among them is a statue that had been in an apartment building's courtyard since the early 20th century until its theft in the 1980s, and which was found in 2009. There are artifacts from Pompeii that a French archaeologist bought from a local farmer in the 1990s for 50,000 lire (about $28 today). There are also ancient ceramics, coins, bronzes, marbles, pottery, furnishings, weapons and armor dating from the Archaic Period (approximately 650 to 480 BC) to the Middle Ages.",
      "\u201cIt is a beautiful exhibition that tells a beautiful story, a story also of redemption for our stolen archaeological artifacts, which often find their way into private property or even international museums,\" Massimo Osanna, the head of national museums at Italy\u2019s culture ministry, who helped curate the exhibition, said in an interview. \"Thanks to the work of the public prosecutor\u2019s office and the police, together with the ministry, (these artifacts) are finally coming home and to light.\u201d",
      "In 2023, the latest year for which there are complete records, the police unit recovered over 100,000 artifacts which it estimates are worth a total 264 million euros ($299 million).",

      "Before she kicks off her upcoming world tour, Katy Perry is reaching for the stars",
      "ONTARIO, Calif. -- After a long day of rehearsing for her upcoming world tour, Katy Perry decided to peruse a few books to help her unwind before bed.",
      "\u201cI was listening to \u2018Cosmos\u2019 by Carl Sagan and reading a book on string theory,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI\u2019ve always been interested in astrophysics and interested in astronomy and astrology and the stars. We are all made of stardust and we all come from the stars.\u201d",
      "But the pop superstar was motivated by more than just curiosity. On Monday, she will join Jeff Bezos\u2019 fiancee Lauren Sanchez, journalist Gayle King and three other women on an all-female Blue Origin spaceflight. Perry spoke with The Associated Press at her Southern California rehearsal space on Wednesday, days before she was set to leave for training in Texas.",
      "\u201cI am talking to myself every day and going, \u2018You\u2019re brave, you\u2019re bold, you are doing this for the next generation to inspire so many different people but especially young girls to go, \u201cI\u2019ll go to space in the future.\u201d No limitations,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Perry said she has been \u201cpsychologically\u201d preparing for the spaceflight by reading work from the late Sagan and other scientists.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really excited about the engineering of it all. I\u2019m excited to learn more about STEM and just the math about what it takes to accomplish this type of thing,\u201d she said.",
      "An all-female spaceflight seems an apt endeavor for the 40-year-old Perry, whose collection of hits include songs about extraterrestrials (\u201cE.T.\u201d) and fireworks shooting across the sky (\u201cFirework\u201d), as well as feminist anthems like her 2013 hit, \u201cRoar,\u201d and \u201cWOMAN\u2019S WORLD,\u201d off her most recent album.",
      "Perry said that whenever she is doing something new or daunting, she looks inward for strength and confidence.",
      "\u201cUsing that feminine divine that I was born with and definitely unlocked when I had my daughter even more. It leveled up for sure. Being a mother just makes you level up with that type of power,\u201d she said. Her daughter, Daisy, 4, joined Perry before her rehearsal.",
      "Bezos\u2019 rocket company Blue Origin announced the crew in February. Sanchez, a helicopter pilot and former TV journalist, picked the women who will join her on a 10-minute spaceflight from West Texas aboard a New Shepard rocket. Perry, Sanchez and King will be joined by Aisha Bowe, a former NASA rocket scientist who now heads an engineering firm, research scientist Amanda Nguyen and movie producer Kerianne Flynn.",
      "\u201cI am feeling so grateful and grounded and honored to be invited and included with this incredible group of women,\u201d Perry said. Whenever she gets nervous about the trip, she reminds herself how important it is.",
      "Blue Origin has flown tourists on short hops to space since 2021, after Bezos climbed aboard with his brother for the inaugural trip; the upcoming trip will be the company's 11th human spaceflight. Some passengers have received free rides, while others have paid a hefty sum to experience weightlessness. The company declined to comment on who is footing the bill for Monday's flight.",
      "The news of the upcoming trip has not been without critiques, most recently from actor Olivia Munn, who bemoaned the mission's cost and publicity. But Perry believes an all-women crew \u2014 the first since Valentina Tereshkova\u2019s solo spaceflight in 1963 \u2014 has historic ramifications.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an important moment for the future of commercial space travel and for humanity in general and for women all around,\u201d she said, citing the fact that only about 11% of the people who have gone to space have been women. \u201cI\u2019m excited for that number to be even more equal after this flight. And I just feel like, \u2018Put us in coach.\u2019\u201d",

      "The 51-year-old Lauren, identified by police as Jillian Shriner and listed as Jillian Lauren Shriner in jail records, had injuries that were not life threatening after the shooting in the northeast Los Angeles neighborhood of Eagle Rock on Thursday, the LAPD said in a statement.",

      "Police said they were assisting California Highway Patrol officers in their search for three suspects from a misdemeanor hit-and-run. Lauren was not among the suspects. But while pursuing one of them who had reportedly been running through a backyard, police came upon Lauren in the front yard of her neighboring residence, holding a handgun.",
      "They ordered her several times to drop the gun, but she refused, and pointed it at them, police allege. They did not say whether she fired the gun, but said she was hit by police gunfire and fled into her home, where they took her into custody then took her to a hospital.",
      "A 9-millimeter handgun was recovered from Shriner\u2019s home, the police statement said.",
      "She was later booked and was being held on $1 million bail, LA County jail records showed.",
      "Lauren has not made a court appearance, and it was not immediately clear whether she has hired a lawyer. There were no immediate responses to an email to her manager and a message left on her author website. There was also no response to an email seeking comment from a representative for Weezer.",
      "Lauren is the author of two bestselling memoirs, 2010's \u201cSome Girls: My Life in a Harem\u201d and 2015's \u201cEverything You Ever Wanted.\u201d",

      "Lawyers for 40 women who accused writer and director James Toback of sexual abuse over a 35-year span say they have been awarded $1.68 billion from a New York jury",
      "A New York jury on Wednesday awarded $1.68 billion in damages to 40 women who accused writer and director James Toback of sexual abuse and other crimes over a span of 35 years, according to lawyers representing the plaintiffs.",
      "The decision stems from a lawsuit filed in Manhattan in 2022 after New York state instituted a one-year window for people to file lawsuits over sexual assault claims even if they took place decades ago.",
      "It marks one of the largest jury awards since the advent of the #MeToo movement, as well as in New York state history, said attorney Brad Beckworth, of the law firm Nix Patterson LLP, in an interview. The plaintiffs, he said, believe such a large verdict will send a message to powerful individuals \u201cwho don't treat women appropriately.\u201d",
      "The court had not yet released documentation of the verdict as of Wednesday night. Beckworth said the verdict included $280 million in compensatory damages and $1.4 billion for punitive damages to the plaintiffs.",
      "\u201cThis verdict is about justice,\u201d Beckworth said in a statement. \u201cBut more importantly, It\u2019s about taking power back from the abusers \u2014 and their and enablers \u2014 and returning it to those he tried to control and silence.\u201d",
      "Beckworth said the abuse took place between 1979 and 2014.",
      "Toback was nominated for an Oscar for writing 1991\u2032s \u201cBugsy,\u201d and his career in Hollywood has spanned more than 40 years. Accusations that he engaged in years of sexual abuse surfaced in late 2017 as the #MeToo movement gained attention. They were first reported by the Los Angeles Times.",
      "In 2018, Los Angeles prosecutors said the statutes of limitations had expired in five cases they reviewed, and declined to bring criminal charges against Toback.",
      "The plaintiffs then filed a lawsuit in New York a few days after the state's Adult Survivors Act went into effect. The lawyers said they discovered a pattern of Toback attempting to lure young women on the streets of New York into meeting him by falsely promising roles in his films and then subjecting them to sexual acts, threats and psychological coercion.",
      "Mary Monahan, a lead plaintiff in the case, called the jury award \u201cvalidation\u201d for her and the other women.",
      "\u201cFor decades, I carried this trauma in silence, and today, a jury believed me. Believed us. That changes everything,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThis verdict is more than a number \u2014 it\u2019s a declaration. We are not disposable. We are not liars. We are not collateral damage in someone else\u2019s power trip. The world knows now what we\u2019ve always known: what he did was real.\u201d",
      "Toback, 80, who most recently had represented himself, denied numerous times in court documents that he \u201ccommitted any sexual offense\u201d and that \u201cany sexual encounter or contact between Plaintiffs and Defendant was consensual.\u201d",
      "He also argued that New York's law extending the statute of limitations on sexual abuse cases violated his constitutional rights.",
      "A message sent to an email address listed for him seeking comment was not immediately answered.",
      "In January, the judge in the case entered a default judgment against Toback, who had failed to appear in court when ordered to do so. The judge then scheduled a trial for only damages last month to determine how much Toback had to pay the women.",

      "Smart phones have largely been a bit of a buzzkill for horror films, leading filmmakers to find all kinds of reasons \u2014 dead batteries, no service \u2014 to strand potential prey. But at least since 1949\u2019s \u201cSorry, Wrong Number,\u201d phones have also been a reliable conduit for terror capable of reaching into the home, or your pocket. \u201cDrop,\u201d a silly but suspenseful new thriller, carries on the tradition of \u201cWhen a Stranger Calls\" and \u201cPhone Booth\u201d by situating its tension around mysterious, threatening phone messages.",
      "Violet ( Meghann Fahy ), a widow with a young child, is on her first date in years. After three months of texting, she has hesitantly agreed to finally meet Henry (Brandon Sklenar) for dinner. When they sit down in a fancy restaurant high up a sleek Chicago high-rise, he\u2019s charming and relaxed. But Violet, like countless dates before her, can\u2019t stay off her phone.",
      "In Violet\u2019s case, though, the distraction is legitimate. She keeps getting messages dropped to her phone threatening her son, who\u2019s at home with Violet\u2019s sister (Violett Beane), unless she does what he says, including killing her date. In her home security cameras she can see a man with his face covered brandishing a gun.",
      "\u201cDrop,\u201d directed by Christopher Landon (\u201cHappy Death Day\u201d), doesn\u2019t differ greatly from the large swath of high-concept, low-budget thrillers that regularly flood theaters. But it\u2019s a taut little movie, almost totally set in the restaurant, with a just keen enough sense of plausible and preposterous. It knows to keep the pressure-cooker plot moving while not overstaying its welcome. At a nifty 95 minutes, \u201cDrop\u201d knows when to hang up.",
      "As if adding a digital twist to the old line \u201cThe call is coming from inside the house,\u201d Violet is getting message from an app called DigiDrop that can only be sent from a person within 50 feet. That means everyone in the restaurant \u2014 the bro who bumps into her, the cheesy waiter, the kind bartender \u2014 is a suspect. With her terrorizer watching her every move and prohibiting her from breathing a word to anyone, Violet is stuck rooted to her table when every fiber of her being wants to rescue her son.",
      "A considerable help to the film are the grounded screen presences of Fahy (\u201cThe White Lotus\u201d) and Sklenar (\u201c1923\u201d), both small-screen breakouts who here show movie-star poise. As the plot unspools, there are, naturally, quibbles one could make. Would a mother, with a masked gunman outside her toddler\u2019s door be able to feign interest in a duck salad? Does the highly orchestrated trap laid for her match the motives of the criminal mastermind? And while we're asking questions, could we not someday get a phone-themed thriller titled \u201cButt Dial\u201d?",
      "But if \u201cDrop\u201d is invariably quite a bit less than realistic, it has a whiff of metaphor. Violet isn\u2019t just stepping back into the dating pool as a single mom, she\u2019s trying to shake the past trauma of spousal abuse. Going on a date with Henry, whom she met on an app, is a kind of crap shoot. Will going out with a stranger met online end in love or violence?",
      "You could also read \u201cDrop\u201d as an extreme version of a more ubiquitous scourge. This is a movie where the bad guy, for nearly the duration of the movie, is nothing but text messages. (They are typically flashed large across the screen.) As Violet grows increasingly preoccupied and frantic, she could be just about anyone \u2014 a workaholic after hours, a teenager, a desperate Knicks fan watching the score \u2014 whose attention is held prisoner by her phone. How much of the terror of \u201cDrop\u201d would have existed at all, if she had just put it on silent?",
      "\"Drop,\u201d a Universal Pictures release is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for strong violent content, suicide, some strong language and sexual references. Running time: 95 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",

      "Guests enter the museum and walk past an enormous flower arrangement in the museum\u2019s grand lobby \u2013 always a talking point. Often there is an an orchestra playing nearby. At the top of the grand staircase, Wintour and her co-hosts form a receiving line. Guests then head either to cocktails or to view the exhibit. Cocktails are followed by dinner. The most hotly anticipated guests sometimes skip cocktails and even dinner, and arrive around dessert time for maximum impact (we're looking at you, Rihanna).",

      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- The roof of an iconic nightclub in the capital of the Dominican Republic collapsed nearly an hour after a merengue concert began, killing at least 98 people and injuring at least 160. Politicians and athletes were among those at Jet Set in Santo Domingo when disaster struck Tuesday.",
      "Officials said it\u2019s too early to determine why the roof fell.",
      "Rescue crews searched for survivors in the rubble through the night as a crowd of people awaiting word from their loved ones waited anxiously nearby.",
      "The roof collapsed nearly an hour after the merengue concert headed by Rubby P\u00e9rez began at Jet Set, which was known for hosting merengue parties every Monday that drew international and national artists and high-profile Dominicans.",
      "A video posted on social media shows parts of the roof falling as people began to move away seconds before the entire roof fell.",
      "Nelsy Cruz, the governor of Monte Cristi province and sister of seven-time Major League Baseball All-Star Nelson Cruz, was the first person to alert Dominican President Luis Abinader about the disaster. She called him and said she was buried under the debris, according to first lady Raquel Abraje.",
      "Nelsy Cruz later died at the hospital from her injuries, officials said.",
      "Authorities say it\u2019s too early to determine why the roof fell. Firefighters removed blocks of broken concrete and created makeshift planks to try and reach survivors buried under the debris.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how often government officials inspect buildings in the Dominican Republic and when the last inspection was done at Jet Set.",
      "A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Public Works told The Associated Press that all officials were on scene and not available. She referred questions to the mayor\u2019s office.",
      "A spokesperson for the mayor\u2019s office could not be reached for comment.",
      "The owners of Jet Set, who issued a statement saying they were cooperating with authorities, could not be immediately reached for comment.",
      "Relatives of merengue singer Rubby P\u00e9rez, who was performing when the roof collapsed, said earlier that he was rescued.

      "Meanwhile, the singer\u2019s manager, Enrique Paulino, whose shirt was spattered with blood, said the group\u2019s saxophonist died.",
      "The Professional Baseball League of the Dominican Republic posted on X that former MLB pitcher Octavio Dotel died. Officials had earlier rescued Dotel from the debris and transported him to a hospital. Also killed was Dominican baseball player Tony Enrique Blanco Cabrera, said Satosky Terrero, league spokesman.",
      "It\u2019s an iconic nightclub in southern Santo Domingo that has operated for nearly five decades. It was known for its \u201cJet Set Mondays\u201d that featured local and international artists.",
      "The club opened in 1973 as a club and restaurant, becoming the most popular venue of its kind in the Dominican Republic, according to List\u00edn Diario, a local newspaper.",
      "It later moved from the place where it originally opened, celebrating its first anniversary with merengue and salsa icon Johnny Ventura.",
      "The club underwent renovations in 2010 and 2015, and it was struck by lightning in 2023, according to the newspaper.",
      "General admission tickets for Monday\u2019s concert with Rubby P\u00e9rez were $32, while the VIP ones were $40, according to the club\u2019s website.",
      "Rescue crews were to continue looking for survivors through the night.",
      "While an in-depth investigation into the collapse is expected, authorities have not yet commented on what might have caused the roof to fall, including any potential preliminary findings.",
      "Prosecutor Rosalba Ramos told TV station CDN that while \u201ceveryone wants to know\u201d what happened, authorities were still focused on finding survivors.",

      "Clem Burke, whose versatile drumming propelled the iconic rock group Blondie during its decades performing everything from new-wave punk to disco-infused tunes, has died. He was 70.",
      "The band said in a statement on its website Monday that he died from cancer but no additional details were provided.",
      "\u201cClem was not just a drummer; he was the heartbeat of Blondie,\u201d the band said in a statement. \u201cHis talent, energy, and passion for music were unmatched, and his contributions to our sound and success are immeasurable.\u201d",
      "The self-proclaimed \u201crock & roll survivalist\u201d started playing the drums when he was 14 in his school orchestra but was kicked out for playing too loud, according to Blondie\u2019s website. In the 1970\u2019s, he answered a band's ad in the Village Voice seeking a \u201cfreak energy\u201d rock drummer, kicking off his decades-long career with lead singer Debbie Harry and the rest of his Blondie bandmates.",
      "The band recorded its first album in 1976 and by the following year was touring with such icons as Iggy Pop and David Bowie. It became known as the most commercially successful band to emerge from a fertile New York rock scene that also produced Talking Heads and the Ramones.",
      "In 2006 Burke and the other original members of Blondie were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame after selling more than 42 million records, according to Blondie's website.",
      "During the late 1970s and early \u201980s, the band had eight Top 40 hits, including four No. 1s: \u201cHeart of Glass,\u201d \u201cCall Me,\u201d \u201cThe Tide Is High\u201d and \u201cRapture,\u201d which is regarded as the first No. 1 hit to feature rap. There\u2019s also a five-track 1975 album demo that includes \u201cPlatinum Blonde,\u201d a sort of band mission statement. But Burke\u2019s mark was especially solidified with his rapid, powerful drumming at the start of \u201cDreaming\u201d in 1979.",
      "In 2022, after unearthing a New Wave treasure trove of reel-to-reel tapes, cassettes and records, the band created the box set \u201cBlondie: Against the Odds, 1974-1982,\u201d with 124 tracks and 36 previously unissued recordings, demos, outtakes and remixed versions of Blondie\u2019s initial six studio albums.",
      "Burke reflected on the discovery in an Associated Press article: \u201cWe never would have thought that we would still be here today. Looking back at our archives, it\u2019s pretty amazing.\u201d",
      "The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame described Burke in a post Monday on the social platform X as \u201ca versatile and distinctive drummer who played exactly what each song required \u2013 and, when called for, let loose with blistering punk rock energy.\u201d",

      "LAS VEGAS -- The sex abuse trial of former \u201cDances with Wolves\u201d actor Nathan Chasing Horse in Nevada has again been postponed.",
      "A judge on Monday moved the start of the trial in state court in Las Vegas to Aug. 4. The 48-year-old had been scheduled to stand trial next week on charges that he sexually abused Indigenous women and girls for years in the Las Vegas area.",
      "Craig Mueller, Chasing Horse's lawyer, said in a motion filed Friday that he needs more time to prepare and interview witnesses. It's the latest in a series of delays since Chasing Horse was arrested and indicted in early 2023.",
      "Chasing Horse has pleaded not guilty to 21 felonies, including sexual assault of a minor under 16, kidnapping and producing and possessing videos of child sexual abuse. If convicted of the sexual assault charges, he could face decades or life in prison.",
      "After starring as Smiles A Lot in the 1990 Oscar-winning film \u201cDances with Wolves,\u201d Chasing Horse began promoting himself as a self-proclaimed Lakota medicine man while traveling around North America to perform healing ceremonies, authorities have said. He was born on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, home to the Sicangu Sioux, one of the seven tribes of the Lakota nation.",
      "Prosecutors say Chasing Horse used his position to gain access to vulnerable women and girls for decades until his arrest near Las Vegas. He has been jailed ever since, but criminal proceedings were at a standstill for more than a year while Chasing Horse challenged his original indictment.",
      "It was eventually dismissed after the Nevada Supreme Court ruled that prosecutors had abused the grand jury process when they provided a definition of grooming as evidence without any expert testimony. The high court's order, however, left open the possibility for charges to be refiled, and prosecutors quickly took their case before another grand jury.",
      "Chasing Horse was again indicted in October. The indictment added new allegations that he filmed himself having sex with one of his accusers when she was younger than 14. Prosecutors have said the footage, taken in 2010 or 2011, was found on cellphones in a locked safe inside the North Las Vegas home that Chasing Horse is said to have shared with five wives, including the girl in the videos.",
      "His case has been unfolding at the same time lawmakers and prosecutors around the U.S. are funneling more resources into cases involving Native women, including human trafficking and killings.",

The comic had been scheduled as a featured speaker April 26 at the White House Correspondents Association' s annual dinner. But the WHCA rescinded the offer to Ruffin, a blunt critic of President Donald Trump, saying it wanted to focus on journalistic achievement.",
      "In a statement Monday, PEN co-interim CEO Clarisse Rosaz Shariyf praised Ruffin for her \u201cbrilliant social commentary, her satire and exceptional talent.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe is truly emblematic of the talented creators who we need on stages and in writers\u2019 rooms during a time of unprecedented censorship in this country. We\u2019re both delighted and honored to have her with us,\" Shariyf added.",

      "Ruffin, whose credits include writing for NBC\u2019s Seth Meyers, last year's host for the PEN gala, has said she was cut from the WCHA event after telling organizers that she had no intentions of being evenhanded. During a Daily Beast podcast last month, Ruffin said she was told \u201cyou need to be equal and be sure that you give it to both sides and I was like, \u2018There\u2019s no way that\u2019s going to happen.'\"",

      "\u201cFinding Your Roots\u201d is PBS\u2019s most-watched program on linear TV and the most-streamed non-drama program. Season 10 reached nearly 18 million people across linear and digital platforms and also received its first Emmy nomination.",
      "\u201cThe two subliminal messages of \u2019Finding Your Roots,' which are needed more urgently today than ever, is that what has made America great is that we\u2019re a nation of immigrants,\" says Gates. \u201cAnd secondly, at the level of the genome, despite our apparent physical differences, we\u2019re 99.99% the same.\u201d",
      "Season 11 has featured Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell, Melanie Lynskey, chef Jose Andres, Sharon Stone and Amanda Seyfried, who learned why her paternal third-great-grandfather was murdered.",
      "Gates shares the last episode with Laurence Fishburne, who learns the identity of his biological father. It turns out both men adored jazz, which delighted Dyllan McGee, who helped create and produce \u201cFinding Your Roots.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt underscored how family connections can shape us, even unknowingly, and made me wonder if reconnecting with our past somehow affirms the significance of our own stories by showing us how much each individual on our tree shapes us even when we don\u2019t know it,\u201d she says.",
      "The series started in 2006 under the title \u201cAfrican American Lives,\u201d conceived by Gates in the middle of the night in his bathroom. He invited prominent Black celebrities and traced their family trees into slavery. When the paper trail ran out, they would use DNA to see which ethnic group they were from in Africa.",
      "Challenged by a viewer to open the show to non-Black celebrities, Gates agreed and the series was renamed \u201cFaces of America,\u201d which had to be changed again after the name was taken. Along the way, Gates had a crash course in DNA.",

      "Over the years, the show has delivered fascinating results, like when Natalie Morales discovered she\u2019s related to one of the legendary pirates of the Caribbean and when former \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d star Andy Samberg found his biological grandmother and grandfather. It revealed that RuPaul and U.S. Sen. Cory Booker are cousins, as are Meryl Streep and Eva Longoria.",
      "Guests have included former U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, designer Diane von Furstenberg and \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d author George R. R. Martin.",
      "\u201cI always tell my guests that you\u2019re not responsible for the crazy things your ancestors did. I don\u2019t care what they did. Guilt is not inheritable,\u201d Gates says. \u201cYou have to understand how the people functioned in the past without judging them.\u201d",
      "He and his team \u2014 particularly genetic genealogist CeCe Moore \u2014 have found that traditional family stories passed down through the generations are often filled with a few lies, often to cover up bad behavior.",
      "\u201cI call it where there\u2019s smoke, there\u2019s fire. The stories are never accurate, but they\u2019re often close,\u201d says Gates. \u201cThere is a kernel of truth there.\u201d",
      "It took researchers four years to resolve the mystery of who was Gates' great-great grandfather, the man who impregnated Jane Gates. The story she told about her children's father turned out to be not correct.",
      "The researchers show him an 1888 obituary for her and a 1839 ad for her sale. Gates comments that he\u2019s seen a thousand bill of sales like it, but this hit differently. At the end, he looks again at a photo of Jane Gates. \u201cI see a lot of pain in those eyes and now I know why.\u201d",
      "\u201cSomething changed for him that day,\" says McGee. \"I remember him calling me after the reveal saying, 'That was the best day of my life!' It was such a treat for the entire team to be able to give him the gift of a missing link in his family history that he has given hundreds of our guests.\u201d",
      "Gates is a huge advocate that everyone should have their family tree traced and pushes back against the idea that digging up the past is divisive.",

      "NEW YORK -- Removing books from library shelves is no longer just a story of objections from a local community or an individual parent, the American Library Association says.",
      "In its new State of American Libraries Report released Monday, the ALA found more than 70% of attempted bans of a given title or titles come from organized groups and elected officials, and just 16% originated with a parent.",
      "The most commonly criticized books, including Maia Kobabe\u2019s \u201cGender Queer\u201d and the late Toni Morrison's \u201cThe Bluest Eye,\u201d can be found on such websites as www.ratedbooks.org and through lists compiled by Moms for Liberty and other conservative activists.",
      "\u201cWe can trace many of the challenges to lists of books that have been distributed by Moms for Liberty and other groups,\" said Deborah Caldwell-Stone, who directs the association's Office for Intellectual Freedom.",
      "As part of its annual report, the ALA unveiled its list of the 10 most \u201cchallenged books\u201d of 2024, starting with George M. Johnson's \u201cAll Boys Aren't Blue,\u201d and also featuring \u201cGender Queer,\u201d \u201cThe Bluest Eye,\u201d Stephen Chbosky's \u201cThe Perks of Being a Wallflower\u201d and John Green's \u201cLooking for Alaska.\u201d",
      "Most of the books listed have LGBTQ+ themes, continuing a yearslong trend. Other objections include references to drug addiction, such as in Ellen Hopkins' \u201cCrank,\u201d and to slavery and sexual abuse, including those in Patricia McCormick's \u201cSold.\u201d",
      "The ALA defines a challenge as a \u201cformal, written complaint filed with a library or school requesting that materials be removed because of content or appropriateness.\u201d The association, which compiles censorship data through media accounts and reports from librarians, has long believed the actual number of challenges is far higher than the numbers cited in its annual studies.",
      "The report comes at an especially perilous time for libraries. The Trump administration is implementing drastic cuts at the Institute of Museum and Library Services, which already is canceling grants to state libraries.",
      "Bans have surged in recent years and several states, from Texas and Florida to Iowa and Utah, have passed laws restricting what school libraries can acquire. While the ALA is reporting a sharp drop in challenges in 2024, down to 821 attempts compared to 1,247 the year before, the number remains far higher than before 2021.",
      "And Caldwell-Stone doesn't believe censorship is declining. Libraries are now more likely to avoid stocking books that are controversial, or may be prohibited by law, she says.",
      "\u201cI spoke to a librarian from Texas who told me she was looking over a political book and wasn't sure if she could add it to the collection,\u201d Caldwell-Stone said. \u201cLibrarians don't want to get prosecuted or otherwise face legal trouble. A lot of librarians are operating under these kinds of threats.\u201d",

      "\u201cI still remember the day I joined the military,\u201d he crooned. \u201cThis is a dream my soul longed for, and if I were to live another life, I\u2019d become a soldier again.\u201d",
      "Barr\u00f3n, who performs under the name \u201cEddy Barr\u00f3n,\" began releasing music videos and songs on Spotify last year in coordination with the Mexican military. His lyrics extol the army\u2019s virtues, celebrate proud parents and honor the fallen.",
      "They stand in stark contrast to the controversial narco corridos, a subgenre that has sparked controversy as famed artists pay homage to cartel bosses, portraying them as rebels going against the system.",
      "Faced with the challenge of addressing a musical style that depicts cartel violence, local governments across Mexico have increasingly banned performances and pursued criminal investigations of bands and musicians. Mexico\u2019s president even vowed to reduce the popularity of narco corridos while promoting other, less violent musical styles.",
      "But Barr\u00f3n, 33, is taking a different approach. Instead of censorship, he wants to build upon the momentum with his own military corridos, an effort to both infuse the genre with more socially acceptable lyrics and recruit young people to the military.",
      "\u201cNarco life is in style and they make it sound really pretty \u2026 but the reality is different,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re playing our part to invite young people to join this movement of positive music.\u201d",
      "Barron's military ballads are part of a wider government push spearheaded by Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who has proposed that the government promote corridos about \u201clove, falling out of love and peace.\u201d",
      "She even announced a government-sponsored Mexican music competition in the northern state of Durango showcasing music that avoids \u201cglorifying violence, drugs and discrimination against women.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt will completely change Mexican music,\u201d she said.",
      "But in a subculture long defined by resistance and putting words to the harsh realities facing the poor, the government's initiatives around the genre have been met with skepticism about official attempts to promote family-friendly narratives.",
      "\u201cI don't think using corridos as a way to incorporate other kinds of narratives, is a bad idea,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Manuel Valenzuela, a Tijuana sociologist who studies the genre. \u201cThere are a lot of songs that sing of peace and love. It\u2019s just that those aren\u2019t the ones that are turning out to be hits \u2026 because we\u2019re living in a moment of aggrieved youth.\u201d",
      "Corridos were born in the 19th century, their classical band instruments and the accordion rooted in German and Polish migration to Mexico. At a time of widespread illiteracy, they were used widely to pass on oral histories.",
      "The ballads took off during the Mexican revolution, when they were used to share stories of war heroes and glory from the conflict.",
      "That is why Barr\u00f3n says he didn\u2019t invent military corridos, but that he\u2019s simply bringing them back.",
      "\u201cCorridos come from the revolution, and we\u2019re doing the same thing as those soldiers and revolutionaries, albeit in a different age, but the result is the same,\u201d he said.",
      "The genre evolved over generations, from singing about smuggling tequila during the 1920\u2019s Prohibition era in corridos tequileros to grappling with the rising wave of cartel violence in Mexico with narco corridos.",
      "\u201cAll the big social issues are told through corridos,\u201d Valenzuela said. \u201cIt\u2019s a metaphor to speak about what we\u2019ve been living through.\u201d",
      "Barr\u00f3n said he would play guitar with his father\u2019s Mexican regional music band as a teenager, and write his own music. He would bring his guitar to play on deployments after he joined the army at 20.",
      "In 2021, he said he began writing his own songs about his time in the military and singing with a military FX Band, named after the type of gun the military uses. But the music never went public.",
      "Around 2023, the genre exploded when artists like Peso Pluma, Fuerza Regida and Natanael Cano began to mix the classic style with trap music in what are known as corridos tumbados. That same year, Peso Pluma bested Taylor Swift as the most streamed artist on YouTube.",
      "A year later, the Mexican army decided to post Barr\u00f3n's music under his artistic name.",
      "The music videos, which have clocked tens of thousands of views on YouTube alone, are layered with images of heavy duty weapons, the Mexican flag, barbed wire and Barr\u00f3n belting out in camouflage and infrared goggles pulled above his military helmet.",
      "Originally intended to entertain troops and boost military recruitment among young Mexicans, Barr\u00f3n's songs took on a different meaning amidst the renewed controversy that has come with the corridos boom.",
      "The musical style has long been criticized for romanticizing cartel violence, but has hit an inflection point in recent years.",
      "Mexican states have implemented performance bans, and prominent artists have received death threats, often claiming to be from rival cartels whose leaders are glorified in their music. And musicians have been forced to cancel shows due to concerns about potential violence.",
      "The controversy intensified last week, after the face of top cartel boss Nemesio Rub\u00e9n \u201cEl Mencho\u201d Oseguera was projected onto a large screen behind the band Los Alegres del Barranco at a music festival in the northern state of Jalisco. The incident, occurring shortly after Oseguera\u2019s cartel was linked to a ranch under investigation as a training camp and body disposal site in Jalisco, sent shockwaves across Mexico.",
      "The performance was met with a cascade of criticisms. Two Mexican states announced criminal investigations, concerts were cancelled and the Trump administration revoked the U.S. visas of band members.",
      "It also marked a hardening in tone by Sheinbaum, who called for an investigation into the concert, adding: \u201cYou can\u2019t justify violence or criminal groups.\u201d",
      "Barr\u00f3n, who opposes a ban on corridos, believes the solution is to continue to sing cloaked in camouflage with the hopes of reclaiming the Mexican music from his childhood from the negative stereotypes that have grown to define it.",
      "He said the army is already planning to release new songs in the coming months.",
      "\"Sadly, we've been stuck with this label of corridos as negative music,\" he said. \u201cA better approach is to reclaim the genre and take a different path to shift the conversation.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A key program using traditional medicine and foods to tackle chronic disease in Native American and Alaska Native communities has been gutted in the federal health layoffs",
      "CHANDLER, Ariz. -- CHANDLER, Ariz. (AP) \u2014 Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. spent time in tribal communities in Arizona and New Mexico this week highlighting ways they are trying to prevent chronic disease among Native Americans and Alaska Natives, something he has said is one of his top priorities.",
      "But Kennedy didn't appear to publicly address a Native health program using traditional medicine and foods to tackle disproportionate rates of conditions like diabetes and liver disease. The program, called Healthy Tribes, was gutted in this month's federal health layoffs.",
      "Some Native leaders say they are having trouble grasping the dissonance between Kennedy's words and his actions. With little information, they wonder if Healthy Tribes is part of the Trump administration's push to end diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. There also is confusion about what and who is left at the 11-year-old program, which was part of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, under Kennedy's agency, and doled out $32.5 million a year.",
      "Tribal leaders and health officials told The Associated Press that cuts to the Healthy Tribes program are another violation of the federal government\u2019s legal obligation, or trust responsibility, to tribal nations under treaties, law and other acts. That includes funding for health care through the Indian Health Service, as well as education and public safety for citizens of the 574 federally recognized tribes.",
      "But federal funding has long fallen short of meeting those needs, leaving tribal governments to rely on additional grants and programs like Healthy Tribes.",
      "\u201cSo many layers of communications of collaboration and partnerships have just been turned off,\u201d said Onawa Miller, a Quechan Indian Nation citizen and director of tribal public health for United South and Eastern Tribes, which serves 33 tribes in those regions of the U.S. She said her organization already has received its annual $2 million in Healthy Tribes funding.",
      "Several tribal facilities received an email from a CDC employee April 1 notifying them that the positions of many people who staffed the Healthy Tribes program had been eliminated \u201cas part of the reduction in force efforts at CDC.\u201d",
      "The American Federation of Government Employees union, which represents thousands of workers at the CDC in Atlanta, said more than 30 civil servant jobs were or are being eliminated. That includes 11 positions in the Healthy Tribes program and others in the larger Division of Population Health.",
      "An email sent to the account of Healthy Tribes director Dr. Julianna Reece, an enrolled member of the Navajo Nation, was met with an automated reply: \u201cDue to the recent HHS reduction in force, I have been placed on administrative leave and will be separated from the agency on June 2nd.\u201d Reece did not respond to requests for comment sent to her federal and personal email accounts.",
      "Part of the government upheaval in the past several weeks includes top officials at the National Institutes of Health being offered transfers to Indian Health Service offices far from Washington, D.C. The National Indian Health Board also has said the government eliminated key staff and programs at the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health\u2019s Center for Indigenous Innovation and Health.",
      "The government is required to consult with tribes on decisions impacting them, like mass layoffs in February at the Indian Health Service that were rescinded hours later, and tribal leaders have warned the Trump administration that such consultations are not happening. In some cases tribes can take legal action against the U.S. for failing to meet its trust responsibilities.",
      "\u201cIt is a violation of trust, without a doubt,\u201d said W. Ron Allen, chairman of the Jamestown S\u2019Klallam Tribe in Washington state.",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not answer questions related to the Healthy Tribes cuts but told the AP in an email that the Indian Health Service was not impacted by this month's workforce reductions and there are no plans to consolidate any of its offices.",
      "Kennedy's swing through the Southwest included a visit to a community health center in metro Phoenix that provides physical and mental health care to Native people and a hike with the Navajo Nation president. He also moderated a panel at the Tribal Self-Governance Conference, held on the Gila River Indian Reservation in Arizona, but didn't take questions from the audience, tribal leaders on stage or journalists.",
      "Allen said he had a constructive conversation with Kennedy, reminding him IHS is already underfunded and understaffed and that tribes rely on additional federal grants and programs.",
      "\u201cYour issue is to reduce the central office, and so we\u2019re OK with that, but move the functions that serve the tribes out to the tribes,\u201d Allen said he told Kennedy. \u201cBecause if we don\u2019t have those resources, how are we gonna make our communities healthy? He agrees.\u201d",
      "Research shows Native Americans have shorter life expectancies than other ethnic groups, and the Indian Health Service says they face higher mortality rates from chronic conditions like diabetes and liver disease.",
      "In Seattle, Healthy Tribes money pays for a program called GATHER, which focuses on integrating traditional tribal medicine practices into health care. Providers at the Seattle Indian Health Board can use medicine made from plants grown in a community garden. A traditional Native medicine apprentice or healer is a part of a patient's care team.",
      "Seattle Indian Health Board President Esther Lucero, a descendant of the Navajo Nation, said her staff meets with people from the CDC and other Healthy Tribes grantees bimonthly to discuss project updates and ensure compliance with grants. But after last week's layoffs, they are having trouble contacting anyone.",
      "\u201cIf you can\u2019t actually administer the dollars, how are you going to actually get them out to the programs?\u201d she said. \u201cWith this current administration, it\u2019s almost like every day we receive an unexpected notice, and then we will get a follow-up notice that says ... you need to move forward as usual.\u201d",
      "Lycia Ortega, interim CEO of Los Angeles-based United American Indian Involvement, echoed concerns about the ambiguous and somewhat confusing messages. Her organization uses Healthy Tribes money to foster connections between younger people and elders in Native American and Alaska Native communities.",
      "Native communities have had to push back against the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to cut programs that might be considered DEI initiatives, she said, with the help of lawyers, policy experts and watchdogs who point out areas where the government might not be honoring the trust responsibility.",
      "Native people \u201chave a distinct political power,\u201d said Ortega, a citizen of the Fort Yuma Quechan Indian Tribe, but \u201cthere are policymakers who see tribes as a threat rather than a partner.\u201d",
      "Stephen Roe Lewis, governor of the Gila River Indian Community, said he told Kennedy privately that consulting with and engaging in respectful partnerships with tribes is key to fulfilling the federal government\u2019s trust responsibilities.",
      "Since the Trump administration began making massive cuts to the federal workforce, many tribal leaders have had to clarify with newly appointed federal officials that services to tribes are not based on race but rather on the political status of tribal nations.",
      "\u201cI made it very clear, we are not DEI \u2014 as tribal nations, as a political entity,\" he said.",

      "The mix-up was discovered in February when the clinic in the city of Brisbane found that the birth parents had one too many embryos in storage, said the provider, Monash IVF, in a statement supplied Friday. Staff discovered an embryo from another patient had been mistakenly thawed and transferred to the birth mother, a spokesperson said.",
      "Australia news outlets reported the baby was born in 2024.",
      "The company, one of Australia\u2019s biggest IVF providers, said an initial investigation had not uncovered any other such errors. Its statement didn\u2019t identify the patients involved or divulge details about the child's custody.",
      "\u201cAll of us at Monash IVF are devastated and we apologise to everyone involved,\u201d said CEO Michael Knaap. \u201cWe will continue to support the patients through this extremely distressing time.\u201d",
      "The \u201chuman error\u201d was made \u201cdespite strict laboratory safety protocols being in place,\u201d the statement said. The company said it had reported the episode to the relevant regulator in the state of Queensland.",
      "Monash IVF opened in 1971 and sees patients in dozens of locations throughout Australia. Last year, the firm settled a class action lawsuit from more than 700 patients, making no admission of liability, after claims its clinics destroyed potentially viable embryos.",
      "The clinic paid a settlement of 56 million Australian dollars ($35 million).",
      "Rare cases of embryo mix-ups have been reported before, including in the United States, Britain, Israel and Europe. A woman in the U.S. state of Georgia in February filed a lawsuit against a fertility clinic after she gave birth to a stranger\u2019s baby.",
      "Krystena Murray realized the error after the baby's birth because she and her sperm donor were both white and the child was Black. Murray said she wanted to raise the baby but voluntarily gave the 5-month-old to his biological parents after she was told she would not win a legal fight for his custody.",
      "In Australia, each state makes its own laws and rules governing the use of IVF, which advocates say puts patients at risk of error or oversight failings. Queensland\u2019s parliament passed its first laws regulating the sector in 2024.",
      "The measures will establish a registry for all people conceived at a clinic and made the destruction of donors\u2019 medical histories illegal.

    "story": [
      "Public officials in 16 states and the District of Columbia are suing the Trump administration to restore access to federal pandemic relief funding for schools",
      "Public officials in 16 states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration Thursday to restore access to pandemic relief aid for schools, saying the Education Department's abrupt halt of hundreds of millions of dollars of promised funding will force cuts to vital services.",
      "The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan by a coalition of 16 Democratic attorneys general, led by New York\u2019s Letitia James, plus Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, also a Democrat. It claims the administration's refusal to release the aid violates federal law because it reversed a prior decision to allow states to access the money through March 2026.",
      "States were notified late last month that the Education Department would not honor deadline extensions granted by the Biden administration to spend the remainder of COVID relief aid approved by by Congress to help schools and students recover from the lasting impacts of the pandemic. Schools were supposed to spend the last of the relief by January but many sought, and were granted, more time.",
      "In announcing the reversal, Education Secretary Linda McMahon said schools had \u201cample time\u201d to spend the money, but the agency would consider requests for extensions for individual projects. The department did not say how much money is left of the total $189 billion approved.",
      "New York state lost access to $134 million, James' office said in a press release. It said the relief funding has supported repairs and improvements to school buildings and the purchase of library books, playground equipment and wheelchair-accessible buses.

      "Outdoor enthusiasts are worried about the loss of their favorite vistas as President Donald Trump's administration considers weakening a 26-year-old rule designed to improve visibility over national parks and wilderness areas",
      "During a hike in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in 1995, Don Barger climbed Chilhowee Mountain hoping to gaze across the valley below. All he saw was a wall of gray haze.",
      "Today, he said, he can see some 50 miles (80 kilometers) across that same valley to the Cumberland Mountains.",
      "A 26-year-old federal regulation known as the regional haze rule has helped cut down on pollution over national parks, wilderness areas and tribal reservations, restoring some of the nation's most spectacular natural vistas for outdoor lovers like Barger. But conservationists fear those gains may be lost after President Donald Trump's administration announced in March the rule is among dozens of landmark environmental regulations that it plans to roll back.",
      "\u201cIt means a promise that was made to the American public is lost,\u201d Barger, 74, said. \u201cMore and more generations of people are going to grow up as ignorant as I was, not realizing what I'm missing and not seeing.\u201d",
      "Haze forms when small particles of air pollution, such as sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides, scatter and absorb sunlight, blurring views and decreasing visibility.",
      "Congress amended the Clean Air Act in 1977 to make restoring and maintaining visibility a goal for 156 national parks, wilderness areas, wildlife refuges and tribal reservations across 36 states. That includes places like the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina and Tennessee; Grand Canyon National Park; Glacier National Park; and the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.",
      "After years of drafting and litigation, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency adopted regulations known as the regional haze rule in 1999 to implement the amendments.",
      "The rule calls for attaining natural visibility conditions by the year 2064 and mandates that states come up with plans that include limitations on emissions, compliance schedules and monitoring strategies. Older facilities that emit pollution, such as coal-fired power plants, must adopt mitigation technology such as scrubbers or shut down periodically to decrease overall annual emissions.",
      "The states' plans have been plagued with delays as the EPA approves parts of them and rejects others. For example, two big oil- and coal-producing states, North Dakota and Wyoming, and industry groups filed petitions in federal court in January seeking review of EPA decisions rejecting their plans, according to the Harvard Law School's Environmental and Energy Law Program.",
      "The rule works in conjunction with other federal antipollution regulations, but it's been crucial in clearing the skies over national parks and wilderness areas.",
      "An Associated Press analysis of data from a nationwide network of monitoring sites from 1999, when the rule was implemented, through 2023 shows 93% of the parks and wilderness areas have seen improved air quality on clear days. No parks or wilderness areas have seen any notable worsening in visibility.",
      "Visibility in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park was twice as good on a typical clear day in 2023 as it was in 1999, marking the biggest improvement among the national parks.",
      "The EPA estimates that between 2007 and 2018 the rule has cut 500,000 tons of sulfur dioxide and 300,000 tons of nitrous oxides annually. The average visual range has increased from 90 miles to 120 miles (144 kilometers to 193 kilometers) in some western parks and from 50 to 70 miles (80 kilometers to 112 kilometers) in some eastern parks, according to the Harvard program.",
      "Trump's EPA administrator, Lee Zeldin, announced March 12 that the agency would look to roll back 31 landmark environmental regulations, including the regional haze rule. Zeldin called the announcement the \u201cmost consequential day of deregulation in American history\u201d and said in an essay published in the Wall Street Journal that the administration is \u201cdriving a dagger through the heart of climate-change religion.\u201d",
      "Asked for comment on the regional haze rule, the EPA said they want to better account for pollution from outside the U.S. and from natural sources and avoid unnecessary burdens for states and industry.",
      "In a cost-benefit analysis of the rule before it took effect, the EPA found it would cost energy producers up to $98 billion by 2025 while providing about $344 billion in benefits such as health care savings.",
      "Producers argue that the haze rule has done its job and it doesn't make sense to continue to impose costs on them.",
      "\u201cThis is a matter of diminishing returns,\u201d said Jonathan Fortner, interim president and CEO of the Lignite Energy Council, which advocates for North Dakota's coal industry. \u201cThe air is clean, the data proves it, and the science backs that up. The rule's being misapplied, not because we disagree with clean air goals, but because we're already there.\u201d",
      "Two federal properties in North Dakota are subject to the rule, the Lostwood National Wildlife Refuge and Theodore Roosevelt National Park. The AP analysis found both sites have seen dramatic visibility improvements over the five years from 2019 to 2023.",
      "EPA officials did not respond to an AP request for a list of power plants that have closed due to the regional haze rule. A number of energy industry groups did not return repeated requests for comment, including the U.S. Energy Association and the National Utility Contractors Association.",
      "Advocates of the rule say eliminating it could lead to reduced tourism and the economic boom visitors bring to national park regions. The National Park Service estimates 325 million people visited national parks in 2023, spending $26.4 billion in gateway communities.",
      "Nothing appears likely to change overnight. Conservationists expect the Trump administration to pursue a rollback through language revisions in the rule, a process that would require a public comment period and would likely trigger court challenges that could last years.",
      "\u201cI've watched the Great Smoky Mountains National Park emerge from the chemical haze that once enshrouded it and was getting worse,\u201d Barger said. \u201cIt's just this visceral sense of place. We had lost it entirely. The Clean Air Act is working and it's a work in progress. You have to stay with it or it doesn't work.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is reversing course on its requirement for all staffers to report to the office",
      "WASHINGTON -- Weeks after ordering all Food and Drug Administration employees back into the office, the agency is reversing course, allowing some of its most prized staffers to work remotely amid worries that recent layoffs and resignations could jeopardize basic functions, like approving new medicines.",
      "An internal email obtained by The Associated Press states that FDA leadership are \u201callowing review staff and supervisors to resume telework\u201d at least two days a week. The policy shift was confirmed by three FDA staffers who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal agency matters.",
      "The message was sent Tuesday to some of the FDA\u2019s hundreds of drug reviewers. Staffers said a similar policy was communicated to reviewers who handle vaccines, biotech drugs, medical devices and tobacco products\u2014 although not always in writing.",
      "It\u2019s the latest example of the Trump administration\u2019s chaotic approach to overhauling the federal health workforce, which has included firings, a scramble to rehire some employees, and then additional layoffs last week of an estimated 3,400 staffers, or more than 15% of the agency\u2019s workforce. When FDA employees were called back to the agency's Maryland headquarters last month they confronted overflowing parking lots, crowded offices and broken or missing supplies.",
      "A spokeswoman for Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the administration is returning to \u201cpre-COVID telework arrangements for reviewers, whose read and write work output is tracked in 15-minute increments to ensure productivity and accountability.\u201d",
      "While many agencies switched to telework during the pandemic, the FDA began embracing the practice nearly two decades earlier. The flexibility was seen as a competitive perk for recruiting employees who can often earn more working in industry.",
      "Last week's cuts included entire offices focusing on FDA policy and regulations, most of the agency\u2019s communication staff and teams that support food inspectors and investigators. Senior officials overseeing tobacco, new drugs, vaccines and other products have also been dismissed or forced to resign. Staffers have described rank-and-file employees \u201cpouring\u201d out of the agency.",
      "Former FDA Commissioner Dr. David Kessler called the cuts \"devastating, haphazard, thoughtless and chaotic\" during a House hearing on Wednesday.",
      "When Kennedy announced plans to eliminate 10,000 staffers across the federal health workforce, he noted that FDA medical reviewers and safety inspectors wouldn't be impacted.",
      "In February, HHS was forced to recall some probationary employees who were fired, including hundreds of medical reviewers at FDA, whose salaries are largely funded by industry fees, not federal dollars.",
      "But last week\u2019s cuts combined with resignations and retirements have raised a new threat: that FDA funding could fall so low that it short circuits a long-standing system in which companies help fund much of the agency's operations.",
      "Nearly half the FDA's nearly $7 billion budget comes from fees collected from drug, device and tobacco companies. The agency uses the money to hire thousands of extra staffers to quickly and efficiently review new products. For example, about 70% of the FDA\u2019s drug program is financed by user-fee agreements, which must be reauthorized by Congress every five years.",
      "But the agreements stipulate that if FDA\u2019s federal funding falls below set levels, companies are no longer required to pay fees and, in some cases, can claw back their money. The threshold requirements are designed to ensure Congress continues funding FDA, rather than relying entirely on the private sector.",
      "FDA and industry groups are supposed to begin negotiations later this year to renew several user-fee agreements, including those for drugs and devices.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the agency nor regulated industry can afford for \u2018user fees\u2019 not to be reauthorized,\u201d said Michael Gaba, an attorney who advises FDA-regulated companies.",
      "Whatever the reasoning behind the telework shift, former government officials say it\u2019s a sign that recently confirmed FDA Commissioner Marty Makary is trying to retain and rebuild staffing and resources. Makary made his first appearance at FDA's headquarters last Wednesday, one day after the mass layoffs. According to the memo obtained by the AP, Makary signed off on the return to telework.",
      "\u201cDr. Makary needs to rebuild teams and restart the engine of productivity lost to weeks of job insecurity, uncertainty and shortages of team members,\u201d said Steven Grossman, a former HHS official. \u201cTurning commuting time back into work time is a great first step in achieving both.\u201d",

      "A day care facility in a Texas county that's part of the measles outbreak has multiple cases, including children too young to be fully vaccinated, public health officials say.",
      "West Texas is in the middle of a still-growing measles outbreak with 481 cases Friday. The state expanded the number of counties in the outbreak area this week to 10. The highly contagious virus began to spread in late January and health officials say it has spread to New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas and Mexico.",
      "Three people who were unvaccinated have died from measles-related illnesses this year, including two elementary school-aged children in Texas. The second child died Thursday at a Lubbock hospital, and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended the funeral in Seminole, the epicenter of the outbreak.",
      "As of Friday, there were seven cases at a day care where one young child who was infectious gave it to two other children before it spread to other classrooms, Lubbock Public Health director Katherine Wells said.",
      "\u201cMeasles is so contagious I won\u2019t be surprised if it enters other facilities,\u201d Wells said.",
      "There are more than 200 children at the day care, Wells said, and most have had least one dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, which is first recommended between 12 and 15 months old and a second shot between 4 and 6 years old.",
      "\u201cWe do have some children that have only received one dose that are now infected,\u201d she said.",
      "The public health department is recommending that any child with only one vaccine get their second dose early, and changed its recommendation for kids in Lubbock County to get the first vaccine dose at 6 months old instead of 1. A child who is unvaccinated and attends the day care must stay home for 21 days since their last exposure, Wells said.",
      "Case count and hospitalization numbers in Texas have climbed steadily since the outbreak began, and spiked by 81 cases from March 28 to April 4, with 16 more people hospitalized in that time.",
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention met with Texas officials Monday to determine how many people it would send to West Texas to assist with the outbreak response, spokesman Jason McDonald said Monday. He expected a small team to arrive later this week, followed by a bigger group on the ground next week.",
      "The CDC said its first team was in the region from early March to April 1, withdrawing on-the-ground support days before a second child died in the outbreak.",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Monday said he plans to tell the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention soon to stop recommending fluoridation in communities nationwide. Kennedy also said he\u2019s assembling a task force to focus on the issue.",
      "Also on Monday, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced it is reviewing \u201cnew scientific information\" on potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water.",
      "Kennedy told The Associated Press of his plans after a news conference in Salt Lake City.",
      "Utah last month became the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water, pushing past opposition from dentists and national health organizations who warned the move would lead to medical problems that disproportionately affect low-income communities.",
      "Republican Gov. Spencer Cox signed legislation barring cities and communities from deciding whether to add the cavity-preventing mineral to their water systems. Water systems across the state must shut down their fluoridation systems by May 7.",
      "Kennedy praised Utah for emerging as \u201cthe leader in making America healthy again.\u201d He was flanked by Utah legislative leaders and the sponsor of the state\u2019s fluoride law. \u201cI\u2019m very, very proud of this state for being the first state to ban it, and I hope many more will,\u201d he said.",
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who appeared with Kennedy at the news conference, said his agency was launching a renewed examination of scientific studies on the potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water to help inform any changes to the national standards.",
      "\u201cWhen this evaluation is completed, we will have an updated foundational scientific evaluation that will inform the agency\u2019s future steps,\u201d Zeldin said. \u201cSecretary Kennedy has long been at the forefront of this issue. His advocacy was instrumental in our decision to review fluoride exposure risks and we are committed to working alongside him, utilizing sound science as we advance our mission of protecting human health and the environment.\u201d",
      "Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the CDC. In 1950, federal officials endorsed water fluoridation to prevent tooth decay, and in 1962 set guidelines for how much should be added to water.",
      "Kennedy, a former environmental lawyer, has called fluoride a \u201cdangerous neurotoxin\u201d and said also it\u2019s been associated with arthritis, bone breaks, and thyroid disease. Some studies have suggested such links might exist, usually at higher-than-recommended fluoride levels, though some reviewers have questioned the quality of available evidence and said no definitive conclusions can be drawn.",
      "Fluoride can come from a number of sources, but drinking water is the main one for Americans, researchers say. Nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population gets fluoridated drinking water, according to CDC data. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water was long considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "About one-third of community water systems \u2014 17,000 out of 51,000 across the U.S. \u2014 serving more than 60% of the population fluoridated their water, according to a 2022 CDC analysis. The agency currently recommends 0.7 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water.",
      "But over time, studies have documented potential problems. Too much fluoride has been associated with streaking or spots on teeth. Studies also have traced a link between excess fluoride and brain development.",
      "A report last year by the federal government\u2019s National Toxicology Program, which summarized studies conducted in Canada, China, India, Iran, Pakistan and Mexico, concluded that drinking water with more than 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter \u2014 more than twice the recommended level in the U.S. \u2014 was associated with lower IQs in kids.",

      "The Greek section of Doctors Without Borders, also known by its French acronym MSF, said Monday its staff had diagnosed the children, who are aged between 6 months and 6 years old, with moderate to severe acute malnutrition and in need of immediate medical intervention.",
      "\u201cChildren make up about 25% of the (camp\u2019s) population, yet pediatric care remains insufficient, not only within the center but on the entire island of Samos,\u201d MSF Greece\u2019s Director General Christina Psarra said in a news release.",
      "The six children, who hailed from Afghanistan and Syria, all arrived in the camp with their families within the last two to three months, and it was not possible to determine whether they had already been suffering from malnutrition before they arrived, Psarra told The Associated Press.",
      "However, \u201cdefinitely the conditions in the camp have made things more difficult and have had an aggravating effect,\u201d she said.",
      "Asked about the MSF claims, the Ministry of Migration and Asylum said it would have a response later Monday.",
      "Psarra said that while meals were provided for the camp\u2019s residents, the diet \u201cis not nutritious for children of this age.\u201d The situation was exacerbated by the severance nine months ago of a stipend provided to asylum seekers in Greece, which had allowed them to purchase fresh food and other basic necessities, she added.",
      "Officially designated as a \u201cclosed controlled access center,\u201d the European Union-funded migrant camp in Samos, built on a hillside about 8 kilometers (5 miles) from the island\u2019s main port of Vathy, was opened in 2021 to replace a massively overcrowded camp that had developed on the town\u2019s fringes.",
      "The camp, which is guarded by police and private security, has a capacity of 3,664 people and as of Monday, it was housing 3,176 people, according to the Ministry of Migration and Asylum.",
      "Psarra noted that the children had already endured grueling journeys to arrive in Samos, and conditions inside the camp exacerbated their medical situation.",
      "Rights groups have reported dire conditions in the camp in Samos, including poor sanitation and a shortage of running water.",
      "\u201cThey are children who have been through painful journeys. They have had many difficulties in arriving,\u201d Psarra said of the malnourished children on Samos. \u201cThe conditions in the camp makes it even worse.\u201d",
      "Greece lies on one of the most popular routes into the EU for people fleeing conflict and poverty in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Many make the short but treacherous boat journey from the Turkish coast to nearby Greek islands like Samos, often in small, unseaworthy inflatable dinghies.",
      "Last week, at least seven people, including three children, died near another Greek island, Lesbos, after the inflatable dinghy they were traveling in sank. Another 23 people survived and were taken to a migrant camp in Lesbos.",

      "The \u201cZero Suicide Model\u201d was developed in 2001 at Detroit-based Henry Ford Health, where the focus on people considering suicide included collaborating with patients to reduce their access to lethal means such as firearms and then following up with treatment.",
      "The approach made a difference, and for all of 2009, the health system saw no suicides among patients. The researchers then studied what happened when a different health system, Kaiser Permanente, adopted the program in four locations from 2012 through 2019.",
      "Suicides and suicide attempts fell in three of the locations, while the fourth maintained a low rate of suicides and attempts. Suicide attempts were tracked in electronic health records and insurance claims data. Suicides were measured using government death records.",
      "Reductions varied and reached up to 25%, said lead author Brian Ahmedani, of Henry Ford Health.",

      "The study, published Monday in JAMA Network Open, shows the model works, said Katherine Keyes, a Columbia University public health professor who studies suicide.",
      "Prior research has shown that nearly everyone who dies by suicide is seen by a health care provider in the year before their death, Keyes said. Many doctor's offices have started asking patients whether they've thought about harming themselves.",

      "Here is what to know about the Expo 2025 Osaka:",
      "The Osaka Expo is held at Yumeshima, which means \u201cdream island,\u201d a reclaimed industrial waste burial site in the Osaka Bay, where participants from more than 160 countries, regions and organizations showcase their futuristic exhibits inside about 80 pavillons of unique architecture.",

      "On Saturday, the eve of Holy Week, Francis went to the St. Mary Major Basilica in central Rome to pray privately before a favorite icon of the Virgin Mary, Salus Populi Romani. The basilica, which he typically visits before and after his foreign trips, was also his first stop after leaving the Gemelli hospital on March 23.",

      "The initial welcome contrasts with the suffering that follows, leading up to his crucifixion, which Christians observe on Good Friday, followed by his resurrection, celebrated on Easter Sunday.",

      "\u201cBuying a first home has never been easy, but for this generation, it\u2019s never felt further out of reach,\u201d Albanese told his supporters in the west coast city of Perth.",
      "\u201cIn Australia, home ownership should not be a privilege you inherit if you\u2019re lucky. It should be an aspiration that Australians everywhere can achieve,\u201d he added.",

      "The interim president, Gen. Brice Clotaire Oligui Nguema, who led the coup, looked set to win Saturday\u2019s election by a wide margin, analysts said.

      "BANGKOK -- Several Southeast Asian countries kicked off their annual water festival holiday on Sunday, but in the wake of a devastating earthquake last month, Myanmar is missing out on the fun.",
      "The holiday is an occasion for merrymaking during what is usually the hottest time of the year. In Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar, millions normally take part in a mix of raucous play with uninhibited splashing of water on friends and strangers alike, and sober ceremonies to show respect to one\u2019s elders.",
      "Temperatures this time of year can creep above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit). Many who have moved to cities for work return to their native villages and towns to reunite with their families. The celebration is normally spread over several days, culminating on the actual New Year\u2019s Day.",
      "In Myanmar, the holiday is called Thingyan. But this year, the country is struggling to recover from the 7.7 magnitude earthquake on March 28 that devastated its central heartland, killing more than 3,600 people and leveling structures from new condos to ancient pagodas.",
      "Central Myanmar was shaken again on Sunday by a 5.5 magnitude earthquake in one of the biggest aftershocks since the March 28 temblor.",
      "Even before last month's quake, Myanmar was reeling from a repressive military that seized power in 2021 and is carrying out a brutal war on the pro-democracy forces trying to unseat it. In 2020, the pandemic also quashed celebrations.",
      "Still, the holiday offered a brief respite from the grim struggles of daily life in one of the region's poorer countries, and this is the first year Myanmar could celebrate Thingyan's inclusion on the UNESCO Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, an honor attained last December.",
      "A few days after the quake, the military government announced that this year\u2019s festival would be observed peacefully in pursuit of traditional culture and would not include joyous singing and dancing, due to a nationwide grieving period.",
      "People are free to celebrate privately and quietly, and items related to the festival, including water guns, are being sold in malls and stores. However, there is no government-organized entertainment. In Yangon, the country\u2019s largest city, major festival pavilions and decorations that were already being built in front of the City Hall were dismantled.",
      "People\u2019s Square, a major celebration spot in Yangon, will not host the festival this year, but a traditional charity feast will be held without music and dance, the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper reported on Thursday.",
      "In Yangon, the downtown area near City Hall was quiet, in sharp contrast to many past occasions.",
      "The only visible signs of the holiday were the sights of children playing with water in the streets of residential neighborhoods, and mostly elderly people going to Buddhist monasteries and pagodas for traditional prayers.",
      "In the capital, Naypyitaw, state-media reported Saturday that a quiet celebration of the holiday\u2019s recognition by UNESCO would include events such as applying Thanaka, a yellowish-white paste made from ground tree bark as a traditional natural cosmetic, gently washing the heads and cutting the nails of elderly people as a gesture of respect, and donating food.",
      "Neighboring Thailand, where the holiday is called Songkran, was expected to celebrate with revelry as usual. It sees a mass exodus of the workforce in the capital, Bangkok, return to their upcountry home towns, often extending what is officially a three-day holiday into an entire working week.",
      "Foreign tourists join locals in almost orgiastic water fights, especially in Bangkok\u2019s Khao San Road backpackers district. Water pistols are merely small arms. It is not unusual to see huge buckets of water dumped on any convenient target. Moving vehicles serve as both platforms and targets for attacks.",
      "The holiday is historically pegged to a seasonal movement of the sun, critical to largely agrarian societies. The water hijinks originated in olden days as a ceremony to welcome rainy season. A traditional ritual still practiced by many involves cleansing images of the Buddha and washing the hands and feet of elders.",
      "There is a darker side to the goings-on, as well. Thailand already has one of the world\u2019s highest rates of traffic fatalities, which spikes during Songkran with so many on the move and often inebriated.",

    "story": [
      "Hungarian lawmakers are set to pass a constitutional amendment that critics say targets LGBTQ+ communities and threatens basic civil rights",
      "BUDAPEST, Hungary -- Hungarian lawmakers are preparing to vote on a constitutional amendment viewed by many critics as both a crackdown on the freedoms of assembly and expression and the most recent move by the populist government to restrict the rights of LGBTQ+ communities.",
      "The amendment, which will almost certainly be passed on Monday by the two-thirds majority of Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n's nationalist Fidesz party, would permanently codify a ban on public events held by LGBTQ+ communities \u2014 including the popular Pride event that draws thousands annually in the capital, Budapest.",
      "It will also provide a constitutional basis for denying the gender identities or sexual characteristics of minority groups, and allow for some Hungarians to have their citizenship suspended if they are deemed to pose a threat to Hungary's security or sovereignty.",
      "Here's what the amendment will do, what it entails for LGBTQ+ Hungarians, and for some of the basic rights of all citizens in the Central European nation.",
      "The amendment, the 15th to Hungary\u2019s constitution since it was unilaterally authored and approved by the ruling Fidesz-KDNP coalition in 2011, gives legal support to a law fast-tracked in March that made it an offense to hold or attend events that violate the country's contentious \u201cchild protection\u201d legislation, which prohibits the \u201cdepiction or promotion\u201d of homosexuality to minors aged under 18.",
      "That law also allows authorities to use facial recognition tools to identify individuals that attend prohibited events \u2014 such as Budapest Pride \u2014 and can come with fines for violators of up to 200,000 Hungarian forints ($546).",
      "Some legal experts have argued that such a restriction on assembly rights violates Hungary's constitution. In order to bring the Pride ban in line with constitutional protections, the amendment declares that children\u2019s rights to moral, physical and spiritual development supersede any other fundamental right other than the right to life \u2014 including that to peacefully assemble.",
      "The amendment also declares that \u201ca person\u2019s sex at birth is a biological characteristic and can be either male or female\u201d \u2014 an expansion of an earlier amendment that prohibits same-sex adoption by stating that a mother is a woman and a father is a man.",
      "This declaration will provide a constitutional basis for denying the gender identities of transgender people, as well as ignoring the existence of intersex individuals, who are born with atypical sexual characteristics that do not align with binary conceptions of male and female.",
      "The human rights agency of the United Nations has written that up to 1.7% of the global population is born with intersex traits.",
      "The amendment, as well as previous legislation targeting LGBTQ+ communities, is reminiscent of similar restrictions against sexual minorities in Russia. Orb\u00e1n, seen as Russian President Vladimir Putin's closest ally in the European Union, has in recent years prohibited same-sex adoption and banned any LGBTQ+ content including in television, films, advertisements and literature that is available to minors.",
      "His government argues that its policies are designed to protect children from \u201csexual propaganda,\u201d but critics view them as part of a broader effort to scapegoat sexual minorities and mobilize his conservative base.",
      "Hungary has taken vigorous steps in recent months to protect its national sovereignty from what it claims are foreign efforts to influence its politics or even topple Orb\u00e1n's government.",
      "The self-described \u201cilliberal\u201d leader has accelerated his longstanding efforts to crack down on critics such as media outlets and groups devoted to civil rights and anti-corruption, which he says have undermined Hungary\u2019s sovereignty by receiving financial assistance from international donors.",
      "In a speech laden with conspiracy theories in March, Orb\u00e1n compared people who work for such groups to insects, and pledged to \u201celiminate the entire shadow army\u201d of foreign-funded \u201cpoliticians, judges, journalists, pseudo-NGOs and political activists.\u201d",
      "As part of the government's sovereignty protection efforts, the newest constitutional amendment will make it possible to suspend the Hungarians' citizenship if they are deemed to pose a threat to public order, public security or national security.",
      "Such suspensions would apply to Hungarian citizens who also hold citizenship of another country that is not a member of the EU or European Economic Area. Such suspensions may last for a maximum of 10 years.",
      "The passage of the law banning Pride set off a wave of protests in Hungary with thousands taking to the streets to demand the restoration of assembly rights. Demonstrators employed the tactic of blocking bridges and major thoroughfares in Budapest, something Orb\u00e1n later said would be prohibited by new legislation.",
      "Reacting to the ban on Pride, local organizers wrote: \u201cThis is not child protection, this is fascism.\u201d",
      "On Monday, when lawmakers vote to approve the constitutional amendment, the opposition Momentum party will attempt to blockade the parliament and prevent the vote from taking place. The party accused Orb\u00e1n's government of being an \u201cintimidating and cowardly power,\u201d writing on social media: \u201cLet\u2019s collectively prevent them from leading us down the Putin road and depriving us of our freedom.\u201d",
      "Another protest is expected after the passage of the amendment.",
      "The Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a human rights group, has said the planned amendment \u201cis a significant escalation in the Government\u2019s efforts to suppress dissent and weaken human rights protection.\u201d",
      "The group, along with rights groups the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International and H\u00e1tt\u00e9r Society, have urged the European Commission to launch a procedure against Hungary's government, arguing the amendment and other recent legislation breaches EU law.",

      "There was no immediate response from authorities in Hong Kong. However, in similar previous cases, they have said they give no explanations for refusing to allow entry",
      "Hobhouse is one of more than 40 parliamentarians on the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China that scrutinizes Beijing\u2019s human rights record. Beijing objects viscerally to all such criticism and has rendered the Sino-British Agreement under which Hong Kong was turned over to Chinese rule null and void. It has also slapped travel and financial sanctions on various Hong Kong officials who took part in the 2019 protests.",
      "Since its return to China after 155 years, Hong Kong has seen diminishing Western-style civil liberties and has lost a high degree of autonomy despite promises by the ruling Communist Party in Beijing to keep the status quo for at least 50 years.",

    "story": [
      "Across Europe and further afield, counterterrorism agencies are grappling with a new generation of young people who are being radicalized online and consuming ultraviolent content produced by extremist groups and their supporters",
      "PARIS -- After his arrest, the boy's mother was stunned to discover that her 12-year-old had been learning how to kill and gorging on videos of decapitation and torture so gruesome they made even case-hardened French court officials look away. The mother told criminal investigators that she'd thought her son had been playing video games and doing homework during the hours he spent in his room.",
      "The child's descent into the internet's darkest recesses started innocently enough, with online searches about Islam after an aunt gave him a Quran as a gift, says the boy's lawyer. From there, more searching, automated algorithms that steer users' online experiences and the boy's curiosity ultimately led him to encrypted chats and ultraviolent propaganda pumped out by Islamic State militants and other extremist groups that are worming their way via apps, video gaming and social media into the minds of the very young.",
      "Paul-Edouard Lallois, the French prosecutor who secured the boy's conviction on two terror-related charges last August, says the thousands of images and other extreme content that the child viewed so warped his understanding of the world and of right and wrong that \"it will take years and years of work to enable this kid to recover normal bearings.\u201d",
      "The prosecutor believes that left unstopped, the boy was on a trajectory to possibly becoming a \u201ccompletely dehumanized soldier\u201d who risked joining the ranks of digitally radicalized teenagers in France and beyond who are hatching terror plots and expressing support for extremism. The huge library of violent content, several terabytes of data, that the boy amassed included video tutorials on bomb-making, the prosecutor said.",
      "\u201cIt is possible to completely upend the mental bearings of such a young child,\u201d he said. \"Do that for a few years and, even before he has turned 18, he's already capable of, yes, committing an attack and the worst things with just a knife.\u201d",
      "Across Europe and further afield, the picture is similar: Counterterrorism agencies are grappling with a new generation of attackers, plotters and acolytes of extremism who are younger than ever and have fed on ultraviolent and potentially radicalizing content largely behind their screens. Some are appearing on police radars only when it's already too late \u2014 with knife in hand, as they're carrying out an attack.",
      "Olivier Christen, France's national anti-terrorism prosecutor who handles the country's most serious terror investigations, has a firsthand view of the surging threat. His unit handed terror-related preliminary charges to just two minors in 2022. That number leapt to 15 in 2023 and again last year, to 19.",
      "Some are \u201creally very, very young, around 15 years old, which was something that was almost unheard of no more than two years ago,\u201d Christen said in an interview with The Associated Press. It \u201cdemonstrates the strong effectiveness of the propaganda disseminated by terrorist organizations, which are quite good at targeting this age group.\u201d",
      "The so-called \u201cFive Eyes\" intelligence-sharing network that usually shuns the limelight, comprising U.S., U.K., Canadian, Australian and New Zealand security agencies, is so alarmed that it took the unusual step in December of calling publicly for collective action, saying: \u201cRadicalized minors can pose the same credible terrorist threat as adults.\u201d",
      "In Germany, an Interior Ministry task force launched after deadly mass stabbings last year is focusing on teenagers\u2019 social networks, aiming to counter their growing role in radicalization. In France, the domestic DGSI security agency says 70% of suspects detained for involvement in alleged terror plots are under the age of 21.",
      "In Austria, security services say a 19-year-old suspect arrested in August, with an 18-year-old and a 17-year-old, for an alleged ISIS-inspired plot to slaughter Taylor Swift concertgoers, was radicalized online. So, too, was a suspected ISIS supporter, aged 14, detained this February for an alleged plan to attack a Vienna train station, Austrian authorities say.",
      "The VSSE intelligence agency in Belgium says almost a third of suspects detained there for plotting attacks from 2022 to 2024 were minors \u2014 the youngest only 13. Extremist propaganda \u201cis just a click away for young people in search of an identity or a purpose,\u201d it said in a report in January, with radicalization occurring at speeds that are \u201cnothing short of meteoric.\"",
      "Counterterror investigators say the online radicalization of a child can sometimes take just months. Digitally nimble, kids are adept at covering their tracks and skirting parental controls. The 12-year-old's mother had no inkling that her boy was consulting extremist content, the family\u2019s lawyer, Kamel Aissaoui, told The AP.",
      "And unlike previous generations of militants who were easier for police to track and monitor because they interacted in the real world, their successors are often interacting only in digital spaces, including on encrypted chats to mask their identities and activities, investigators say.",
      "\"They live on their phones, their tablets, their computers, in contact with people they don\u2019t know,\" said a senior official from a European intelligence agency who spoke to The AP on condition of anonymity to discuss its work combatting illegal extremist activity.",
      "Some start \"to imagine who they would attack, how they would go about it, doing actual reconnaissance, hunting for a weapon, consulting tutorials on how to make explosives,\u201d the official said.",
      "For some kids, the process starts with violent pornography or a fascination for gory images, counterterrorism investigators say. From there, more clicks can lead to grisly murder videos from Mexican drug cartels and ultimately to jihadi decapitations, throat-slitting and torture, in videos that are sometimes slickly produced with music and are shared on chat groups.",
      "\u201cOften they\u2019re heavy consumers of everything that is broadcast on the Web and especially things that are forbidden,\u201d said Christen, the French national anti-terror prosecutor. \"It\u2019s something of a chain reaction that gets them to the ultra-violence disseminated by jihadi movements.\u201d",
      "Aissaoui, the child's lawyer, said the trial was so tough on the 12-year-old that the hearing had to be paused twice because he was so distraught. He says the boy isn't violent and was simply a victim of apps and other digital tools that expose kids to extremist content.",
      "\u201cHe was directed from site to site, and so on and so forth, until he came across things he should never have seen,\u201d the lawyer said.",
      "The boy is now in residential care without access to social networks, with specialized educators and regular visitation rights for his parents, the prosecutor told AP.",
      "Counterterrorism investigators say they're dealing with kids from an array of backgrounds. Some have behavioral difficulties and some tend to be loners whose social interactions are largely virtual, but others raise no concerns with their behavior before it draws police attention.",
      "Police analysis of the 12-year-old boy\u2019s computer and phone found 1,739 jihadi videos, \u201ca phenomenal quantity of scenes of decapitation, throat-slitting, shootings,\u201d the prosecutor said. He also had how-to videos on bomb-making and killing, including one that appeared to show the real-life death of a tied-down man being methodically chopped into pieces.",
      "\u201cI have seen some horrible things in my career,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this goes beyond all comprehension.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "What happened on April 13, 1975, would change the course of Lebanon",
      "BEIRUT -- It was an ordinary day in Beirut. In one part of Lebanon's capital, a church was inaugurated, with the leader of the Christian Phalange party there. In another, Palestinian factions held a military parade. Phalangists and Palestinians had clashed, again, that morning.",
      "What happened next on April 13, 1975, would change the course of Lebanon, plunging it into 15 years of civil war. It would kill about 150,000 people, leave 17,000 missing and lead to foreign intervention. Beirut became synonymous with snipers, kidnappings and car bombs.",
      "Lebanon has never fully grappled with the war's legacy, and in many ways it has never fully recovered, 50 years later. The government on Sunday will mark the anniversary with a minute of silence.",
      "Unrest had been brewing. Palestinian militants had begun launching attacks against Israel from Lebanese territory. Leftist groups and many Muslims in Lebanon sympathized with the Palestinian cause. Christians and some other groups saw the Palestinian militants as a threat.",
      "At the time, Mohammad Othman was 16, a Palestinian refugee in the Tel al-Zaatar camp east of Beirut.",
      "Three buses had left camp that morning, carrying students like him as well as militants from a coalition of hardline factions that had broken away from the Palestinian Liberation Organization. They passed through the Ein Rummaneh neighborhood without incident and joined the military parade.",
      "The buses were supposed to return together, but some participants were tired after marching and wanted to go back early. They hired a small bus from the street, Othman said. Thirty-three people packed in.",
      "They were unaware that earlier that day, small clashes had broken out between Palestinians and Phalange Party members guarding the church in Ein Rummaneh. A bodyguard for party leader Pierre Gemayel had been killed.",
      "Suddenly the road was blocked, and gunmen began shooting at the bus \u201cfrom all sides,\u201d Othman recalled.",
      "Some passengers had guns they had carried in the parade, Othman said, but they were unable to draw them quickly in the crowded bus.",
      "A camp neighbor fell dead on top of him. The man\u2019s 9-year-old son was also killed. Othman was shot in the shoulder.",
      "\u201cThe shooting didn\u2019t stop for about 45 minutes until they thought everyone was dead,\u201d he said. Othman said paramedics who eventually arrived had a confrontation with armed men who tried to stop them from evacuating him.",
      "Twenty-two people were killed.",
      "Some Lebanese say the men who attacked the bus were responding to an assassination attempt against Gemayel by Palestinian militants. Others say the Phalangists had set up an ambush intended to spark a wider conflict.",
      "Marwan Chahine, a Lebanese-French journalist who wrote a book about the events of April 13, 1975, said he believes both narratives are wrong.",
      "Chahine said he found no evidence of an attempt to kill Gemayel, who had left the church by the time his bodyguard was shot. And he said the attack on the bus appeared to be more a matter of trigger-happy young men than a \u201cplanned operation.\u201d",
      "There had been past confrontations, \"but I think this one took this proportion because it arrived after many others and at a point when the authority of the state was very weak,\u201d Chahine said.",
      "The Lebanese army had largely ceded control to militias, and it did not respond to the events in Ein Rummaneh that day. The armed Palestinian factions had been increasingly prominent after the PLO was driven out of Jordan in 1970, and Lebanese Christians had also increasingly armed themselves.",
      "\u201cThe Kataeb would say that the Palestinians were a state within a state,\u201d Chahine said, using the Phalange Party's Arabic name. \u201cBut the reality was, you had two states in a state. Nobody was following any rules.\"",
      "Selim Sayegh, a member of parliament with the Kataeb Party who was 14 and living in Ein Rummaneh when the fighting started, said he believes war had been inevitable since the Lebanese army backed down from an attempt to take control of Palestinian camps two years earlier.",
      "Sayegh said men at the checkpoint that day saw a bus full of Palestinians \"and thought that is the second wave of the operation\u201d that started with the killing of Gemayel's bodyguard.",
      "The war unfolded quickly from there. Alliances shifted. New factions formed. Israel and Syria occupied parts of the country. The United States intervened, and the U.S. embassy and Marine barracks were targeted by bombings. Beirut was divided between Christian and Muslim sectors.",
      "In response to the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon, a Shiite militant group was formed in the early 1980s with Iranian backing: Hezbollah. It would grow to be arguably the most powerful armed non-state group in the region.",
      "Hezbollah was the only militant group allowed to keep its weapons after Lebanon's civil war, given special status as a \u201cresistance force\u201d because Israel was still in southern Lebanon. After the group was badly weakened last year in a war with Israel that ended with a ceasefire, there has been increasing pressure for it to disarm.",
      "Othman said he became a fighter because \u201cthere were no longer schools or anything else to do.\u201d Later he would disarm and became a pharmacist.",
      "He remembers being bewildered when a peace accord in 1989 ushered in the end of civil war: \u201cAll this war and bombing, and in the end they make some deals and it\u2019s all over.\u201d",
      "Of the 10 others who survived the bus attack, he said, three were killed a year later when Christian militias attacked the Tel al-Zaatar camp. Another was killed in a 1981 bombing at the Iraqi embassy. A couple died of natural causes, one lives in Germany, and he has lost track of the others.",
      "The bus has also survived, as a reminder.",
      "Ahead of the 50th anniversary of the attack, it was towed from storage on a farm to the private Nabu Museum in Heri, north of Beirut. Visitors took photos with it and peered into bullet holes in its rusted sides.",
      "Ghida Margie Fakih, a museum spokesperson, said the bus will remain on display indefinitely as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d to remind Lebanese not to go down the path of conflict again.",
      "The bus \u201cchanged the whole history in Lebanon and took us somewhere that nobody wanted to go,\u201d she said.",

      "Zoos have undergone a rethink in recent decades with the emphasis on the conservation of species and education, moving away from the past paradigm that often displayed exotic animals as a spectacle",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- At the Barcelona Zoo, a 40-year-old African elephant places her foot through the metal barrier where a zookeeper gently scrubs its sole \u2014 the beloved pachyderm gets her \u201cpedicure,\u201d along with apple slices every day.",
      "The treatment is part of the zoo\u2019s specialized geriatric care for aging animals that cannot be reintroduced into the wild as zoos world over increasingly emphasize lifelong care.",
      "\u201cSending them back into nature would be an error,\" said Pilar Padilla, head of the zoo's mammal care. \"It is very likely they wouldn\u2019t survive.\u201d",
      "Zoos have undergone a rethink in recent decades with the emphasis on the conservation of species and education, moving away from the past paradigm that often displayed exotic animals as a spectacle.",
      "The new approach includes knowing how to adapt to the needs of aging animals, which has led zoos to create bigger, more nature-like enclosures, such as the Sahel-Savannah area at the zoo in the Spanish city of Barcelona.",
      "Along with breeding programs to reintroduce fit animals into nature, zoos today want to ensure that animals living longer due to advancements in veterinary care can age gracefully, said Mart\u00edn Zordan, the CEO of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums, or WAZA.",
      "\u201cSpecialized geriatric care is becoming increasingly essential,\" Zordan told The Associated Press at the organization\u2019s Barcelona offices.",
      "Zordan said that just like older people, elderly animals require more care: regular health checks, arthritis treatment, softer foods or nutritional supplements, adapted living spaces and monitoring of mental and behavioral health.",
      "Along with caring for a pair of aging elephants, the Barcelona Zoo is also the home for a 15-year-old wolf, a leopard and a tiger who are both 17, as well as some older birds \u2014 including a flock of senior flamencos.",
      "It's not alone \u2014 several zoos in the United States, for example, highlight their treatment of older animals, such as the zoos in Baltimore and Baton Rouge.",
      "Zookeepers at the Barcelona Zoo, not far from the city\u2019s Mediterranean coastline, are closely monitoring its two aging female pachyderms, Susi and Bully (pronounced BUH'-yi), as they cope with the recent death of Yoyo, their former pen-mate and long-time companion.",
      "Yoyo died in December at age 54.",
      "Susi, at 52, is now among the oldest known African elephants in captivity, even though WAZA said the age of animals born in the wild is approximate. Bully, who is 40, is also considered old for an African elephant. All three were captured in the wild and spent time in circuses an other zoos before coming to Barcelona.",
      "The zoo is now working with the University of Barcelona to study the impact of Yoyo's death on Susi and Bully. It\u2019s the first study of its kind, focused on elephants not from the same family after the death of a long-time companion, Padilla told The Associated Press during a recent visit to the zoo\u2019s elephant enclosure.",
      "At first, Susi and Bully showed their shock by not eating, but are now adapting well and turning to one another, including even sharing food, Padilla said, adding that Susi has taken on the dominant role that Yoyo had.",
      "For elephants, their teeth are the real age test.",
      "\u201cWhat marks the decline of the animal is the wear on their teeth,\u201d Barcelona zookeeper Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Santamar\u00eda said after finishing the Bully\u2019s pedicure. \u201cThey go through six sets of molars during their life, and when they reach around 40 years old they lose the last set.\u201d",
      "Susi and Bully require daily checkups, food suited for their now molar-less mouths and extra attention to their legs \u2014 hence the daily pedicures and the enclosure's soft sandy floor to cushion aching feet.",
      "\u201cThose are the sort of considerations taken because we care about these animals living comfortably and leading lives with dignity,\u201d Zordan said.",

      "A conservative young millionaire and a leftist lawyer are again the choices before Ecuadorians heading to the polls for the country\u2019s second presidential runoff election in less than two years",
      "QUITO, Ecuador -- A conservative young millionaire who is Ecuador 's incumbent president and a leftist lawyer are again the choices as Ecuadorians head to the polls on Sunday in the country\u2019s second presidential runoff election in less than two years.",
      "President Daniel Noboa and leftist challenger Luisa Gonz\u00e1lez have promised voters solutions to the extortions, killings, kidnappings and other crimes that became part of everyday life as Ecuador emerged from the pandemic.",
      "Voters chose Noboa over Gonz\u00e1lez in the runoff of a snap election in October 2023. Both advanced to Sunday\u2019s contest after being the top vote-getters in February\u2019s first-round election. Noboa won 44.17% of the votes while Gonz\u00e1lez garnered 44%.",
      "Analysts expect Sunday\u2019s results to have a very tight margin. Polls open at 7 a.m. local time (1200 GMT; 8 a.m. EST) and close at 5 p.m. (2200 GMT; 6 p.m. EST) Initial results are expected two hours after polls close.",
      "Voters are primarily worried about the violence that transformed the country, starting in 2021 \u2014 a spike in crime tied to the trafficking of cocaine produced in neighboring Colombia and Peru.",
      "Both candidates have promised tough-on-crime policies, better equipment for law enforcement and international help to fight drug cartels and local criminal groups.",
      "More than 13 million people are eligible to vote, which is mandatory for adults up to the age of 65. It is optional for people aged 16 and 17 and over 65. Failure to vote results in a $46 fine.",
      "In 2023, Noboa and Gonz\u00e1lez were largely unknown to most voters as they sought the presidency for the first time. They were first-term lawmakers in May 2023, when then-President Guillermo Lasso dissolved the National Assembly, shortening his own mandate as a result and triggering that year\u2019s snap election.",
      "Noboa\u2019s first foray into politics was his stint as lawmaker. An heir to a fortune built on the banana trade, Noboa opened an event-organizing company when he was 18 and then joined his father\u2019s Noboa Corp., where he held management positions in the shipping, logistics and commercial areas.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez, 47, held various government jobs during the presidency of Rafael Correa, who led Ecuador from 2007 through 2017 with free-spending socially conservative policies and grew increasingly authoritarian in his last years as president.",
      "Noboa, 37, declared Ecuador to be in a state of \u201cinternal armed conflict\u201d in January 2024, allowing him to deploy thousands of soldiers to the streets to combat gangs and to charge people with terrorism counts for alleged ties to organized crime groups.",
      "Under his watch, the homicide rate dropped from 46.18 per 100,000 people in 2023, to 38.76 per 100,000 people in 2024. But despite the decrease, the rate remained far higher than the 6.85 homicides per 100,000 people seen in 2019.",
      "Some of Noboa\u2019s heavy-handed crime-fighting tactics have come under scrutiny for testing the limits of laws and norms of governing. He has also been criticized for allegations of electoral anomalies he made after February\u2019s vote.",
      "Following the first-round election, Noboa said there had been \u201cmany irregularities\u201d and that in certain provinces \u201cthere were things that didn\u2019t add up.\u201d He provided no further details or evidence. Electoral observers from the Organization of American States and the European Union ruled out fraud.",

      "There were no immediate reports of major damage or casualties caused by the new quake, one of the strongest of hundreds of aftershocks from the March 28 temblor. As of Friday, the death toll from that quake was 3,649, with 5,018 injured, according to Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun, a spokesperson for Myanmar\u2019s military government.",
      "Myanmar\u2019s Meteorological Department said Sunday's quake occurred in the area of Wundwin township, 97 kilometers (60 miles) south of Mandalay, at a depth of 20 kilometers (12 miles). The U.S. Geological Survey estimated the depth at 7.7 km (4.8 miles).",
      "Two Wundwin residents told The Associated Press by phone the quake was so strong that people rushed out of buildings and that ceilings in some dwellings were damaged. A resident of Naypyitaw also reached by phone said he did not feel the latest quake. Those contacted asked not to be named for fear of angering the military government, which prefers to closely control information.",

      "It said the quake severely disrupted agricultural production and that a health emergency loomed because many medical facilities in the quake zone were damaged or destroyed.",
      "Sunday\u2019s quake occurred on the morning of the first day of the country\u2019s three-day Thingyan holiday, which celebrates the traditional New Year. Public festivities for the holiday had already been canceled.",

      "This time, Japan has faced dwindling public interest, and support and was hit by soaring construction costs due to the weaker yen. The cost nearly doubled from the initial estimate to 235 billion yen ($1.64 billion), about 14% of which went to the ring, triggering criticisms from many Japanese over the government's use of their tax money.",
      "The cost increase also caused construction delays for some countries. Several pavilions, including those of Nepal and India, were not quite ready Saturday. Conflicts also affected preparations for Ukraine and the Palestinians. Russia did not participate.",

      "No overall agreement is immediately likely, but the stakes of the negotiations couldn\u2019t be higher for these two nations closing in on half a century of enmity. Trump repeatedly has threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran\u2019s nuclear program if a deal isn\u2019t reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.",
      "Flight-tracking data analyzed by The Associated Press showed a private jet from Pulkovo Airport in St. Petersburg, Russia, arrived in Oman on Saturday morning. U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff had just met Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday there.",
      "Meanwhile, Iran's Foreign Ministry released footage of Tehran's top diplomat, Abbas Araghchi, meeting with Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi. Iran\u2019s state-run IRNA news agency reported that Araghchi provided Iran\u2019s \u201cstance and key points for the talks to be conveyed to the U.S. side.\u201d",
      "IRNA's report suggested the meeting would be held later Saturday.",
      "\u201cIf there is sufficient will on both sides, we will decide on a timetable. But it is still too early to talk about that,\u201d Araghchi said, in an audio clip published by IRNA. \u201cWhat is clear now is that the negotiations are indirect, and in our view only on the nuclear issue, and will be conducted with the necessary will to reach an agreement that is on an equal footing and leads to securing the national interests of the Iranian people.\u201d",
      "Trump and Witkoff both have described the talks as being \u201cdirect.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think our position begins with dismantlement of your program. That is our position today,\u201d Witkoff told The Wall Street Journal before his trip. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean, by the way, that at the margin we\u2019re not going to find other ways to find compromise between the two countries.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cWhere our red line will be, there can\u2019t be weaponization of your nuclear capability,\u201d",
      "While the U.S. side can offer sanctions relief for Iran\u2019s beleaguered economy, it remains unclear just how much Iran will be willing to concede. Under the 2015 nuclear deal, Iran could only maintain a small stockpile of uranium enriched to 3.67%. Today, Tehran\u2019s stockpile could allow it to build multiple nuclear weapons if it so chooses and it has some material enriched up to 60%, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels. Judging from negotiations since Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the deal in 2018, Iran will likely ask to keep enriching uranium up to at least 20%.",
      "One thing it won\u2019t do is give up its program entirely. That makes the proposal of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of a so-called Libyan solution \u2014 \u201cyou go in, blow up the facilities, dismantle all the equipment, under American supervision, American execution\u201d \u2014 unworkable.",

      "LONDON -- U.K. lawmakers returned to Parliament from their Easter break on Saturday to approve an emergency rescue of the country's last remaining factory that makes steel directly from raw materials.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer summoned lawmakers for the highly unusual Saturday sitting to debate a bill aimed at blocking British Steel's Chinese owners, Jingye Group, from closing blast furnaces at its Scunthorpe plant in the north of England.",
      "If the bill passes, which is expected, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds will have the power to direct the company\u2019s board and workforce, ensure workers get paid and order the raw materials necessary to keep the plant's two massive blast furnaces running.",
      "Starmer said Friday that the future of the plant \u201changs in the balance,\u201d necessitating the need for the quick-fire legislation and the recall of Parliament.",
      "Though Starmer did not use not use the term \u201cnationalization,\" he did say all options remain on the table for the steel works, which employs around 2,700 workers directly.",
      "The decision to introduce the emergency legislation was given added urgency by the recent move by Jingye to cancel orders for the iron pellets used in the blast furnaces. Without the pellets and other raw materials, they would likely have to shut for good, potentially within days.",
      "It's unclear what role Jingye, owner of British Steel since 2020, will have in the day-to-day running of the steelworks once the legislation passes.",
      "Jingye, which has said the Scunthorpe plant is financially unsustainable due to \u201cchallenging market conditions\u201d and increased environmental costs, has for months sought a government rescue but discussions have failed to reach a successful outcome. Last month's decision by U.S. President Donald Trump to impose a 25% tariffs on imported steel was another blow.",
      "Though Starmer has expressed disappointment, he has not retaliated and is seeking to negotiate the tariffs away.",
      "Unions have welcomed his initiative to call back Parliament and voiced hope that it will eventually lead to the government taking ownership of the plant.",
      "\u201cIt is in the national interest that a solution is found to secure a future for British Steel as a vital strategic business,\u201d said Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of the union Community. \u201cWe can\u2019t allow Britain to become the only G7 country without primary steelmaking capacity.\u201d",
      "At its height in the postwar period, British steelmaking was a global leader, employing more than 300,000 people, before cheaper offerings from China and other countries hit production. It now employs about 40,000 directly, with the industry accounting for just 0.1% of the British economy.",
      "Britain\u2019s remaining steelmakers are under pressure to reduce carbon emissions. Most have shifted to electric arc furnaces that make steel from recycled material. That has left Scunthorpe as the only factory with blast furnaces capable of turning iron ore into virgin steel.",
      "The steel industry is \u201cpart of our national story,\u201d Starmer said.",
      "The last time lawmakers have been called back from their recess to sit on a Saturday was in 1982, in the aftermath of Argentina\u2019s invasion of the Falkland Islands in the south Atlantic.",

      "Authorities across Central Europe are working to contain a major foot-and-mouth disease outbreak, the first in over 50 years for Hungary and Slovakia",
      "LEV\u00c9L, Hungary -- Authorities in several countries in Central Europe are working to contain an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease among cattle populations that has caused widespread border closures and required the killing of thousands of animals.",
      "The outbreak was first detected on a cattle farm in northwestern Hungary in early March, and animals on three farms in neighboring Slovakia tested positive for the highly transmissible virus two weeks later.",
      "Since then, animals from an additional three farms in Hungary and another three in Slovakia have tested positive for the virus, the first outbreak of the disease in either country in more than half a century.",
      "\"Everything is completely upside down\u201d in the area as farmers fear for their own herds and transportation is disrupted by border closures, said S\u00e1ndor Szoboszlai, a local entrepreneur and hunter in the Hungarian town of Lev\u00e9l where nearly 3,000 cattle had to be culled after the disease was discovered on a farm.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t even think such a thing could happen. Who could count on that? Nobody,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are big farms in the area, but I don\u2019t think it was the fault of the animal owners, that\u2019s for sure. The wind blew it here.\u201d",
      "Foot-and-mouth disease primarily affects cloven-hooved animals like cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and deer, and results in fevers and blisters in the mouth and hooves. The virus spreads through contact between animals, or on surfaces like clothing, skin and vehicles, or on the wind. It poses little danger to humans.",
      "On Friday, authorities in Hungary continued to conduct operations aimed at stopping the spread of the disease and disinfecting affected farms and vehicles in the area. Mats doused in a powerful disinfectant were placed at the entrances and exits of towns and villages across the region to eliminate virus molecules that may cling to tires \u2014 though many of those mats quickly went dry and were swept partially off the road by passing vehicles.",
      "This week, the Slovakian government, citing insufficient containment measures by Hungary, closed 16 of their common borders and one with Austria, all of them lesser-trafficked crossings so authorities can focus on conducting border checks at the major ones. Last week, Austria \u2014 where there have been no reported cases \u2014 closed 23 of its border crossings with Hungary and Slovakia.",
      "Authorities in the Czech Republic, relatively distant from the Hungarian and Slovakian farms where the disease has been detected, have introduced disinfection measures at all the five border crossings used by freight trucks entering the country.",
      "Jiri Cerny, associate professor at the Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague, said the most significant risk of transmission is \u201cthrough contaminated human objects\u201d such as \u201dtires and cars, on the soles of shoes, and through contaminated food.\u201d The Czech Agriculture Minister, Marek V\u00fdborn\u00fd, has said the restrictions could be lifted 30 days after the last farm animal infected with foot-and-mouth disease has been culled in Slovakia.",
      "No new infections have been discovered in Hungary this week, and the cleanup of the last infected farms will likely be completed on Saturday, Istv\u00e1n Nagy, Hungary's agricultural minister said on Friday.",
      "Earlier this week, a Hungarian official said in a news conference that the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak may have been caused by \u201can artificially produced virus.\"",
      "Without citing specific evidence to back his claims, Gergely Guly\u00e1s, chief of staff to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, said it couldn't be ruled out that the disease had been released in Hungary as a \u201cbiological attack,\u201d adding that the suspicion was based on verbal statements from a laboratory in a foreign country that had begun initial analysis of viral samples.",
      "Hungary's government has promised to institute a loan payment moratorium for affected farmers, and to help compensate them for the loss of their animals and assist in developing measures on farms to prevent future outbreaks.",
      "Szoboszlai, the hunter in Lev\u00e9l, choked up when speaking about the local farmer who had to cull his entire herd when the virus appeared, saying the situation was \u201cterrible.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel so sorry for him, because this is his life's work,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be very difficult to start over.\"",

      "NEW YORK -- Taxes may not be the first thing on your mind when you celebrate a joyous occasion like a marriage or a new baby. But once you return from your honeymoon or while your newborn is napping, you'll need to spend some time thinking about them.",
      "Keeping your documents organized, updating your withholding and knowing which tax credits you're eligible for are some crucial steps as couples and parents navigate tax season, said Henry Grzes, lead manager of tax practice & ethics for the American Institute of CPAs.",
      "The deadline to file your 2024 taxes is Tuesday. If you run out of time, you can file for an extension until Oct. 15.",
      "Here are some expert recommendations if you are filing taxes as a newlywed or new parent.",
      "Keeping your tax documents organized is a great practice regardless of your filing year. Having your tax documents in a folder on your personal computer, even if it\u2019s pictures of the documents, can help you have everything in the same place, said Tyler Horn, a certified financial planner and head of planning at Origin, a financial planning app.",
      "\u201cJust take a picture with your phone, send it and keep it in that secure folder on your computer. That way you have everything together,\u201d Horn said.",
      "It's also good to keep your records for the future. The IRS recommends that you keep your documents for at least three years and up to seven depending on your situation.",
      "If you changed your last name, you will need to make sure your government documents reflect this. Your tax return must match your Social Security number so, if you choose to change your name, you\u2019ll need to make a change with the Social Security Administration.",
      "Oftentimes, people forget to make this change ahead of time, which leads them to make mistakes on their tax returns.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s something that people don\u2019t necessarily think about and when they do think about it sometimes it\u2019s it\u2019s too late,\u201d Grzes said.",
      "You can find out more about how to change your name on the Social Security Administration\u2019s website.",
      "One of the biggest changes, for tax purposes, when you get married is whether you choose to file your taxes jointly or separately, Horn said.",
      "To make this decision, each couple should take a look at their specific situation. In most cases, filing jointly might make the most sense but it\u2019s not always that case, Horn said. One of the benefits of filing jointly is that it gives you access to new tax credits and deductions.",
      "It\u2019s important to know that if a couple is married as of Dec. 31, the law indicates that the couple was married for the entire year, Grzes said. So, if you got married in the summer, in the eyes of the IRS you have been married the full year.",
      "You can read more about each filing status on the IRS website.",
      "If you\u2019re planning to file taxes jointly with your spouse, you must update your W-4 form with your employer. Updating your W-4 is meant to reflect your new filing status, from single to married, as well as updating your tax withholding.",
      "Knowing what tax credits and deductions you qualify for is very important when filing your taxes, Horn said. Relevant tax credits for married couples include the Earned Income, American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning tax credits.",
      "When it comes to deductions, you can either opt for a standard deduction or itemize. Itemizing generally only makes sense if your itemized deductions add up to more than the current standard deduction of $29,200 for a married couple.",
      "In some cases, a person that qualifies for the Earned Income Credit as a single filer will no longer qualify if they file jointly with their spouse, Grzes said. To avoid surprises when you\u2019re filing your taxes, Grzes recommends that you work with a tax professional ahead of time.",
      "It\u2019s important that you obtain a social security number for your child as soon as you can, Grzes said. The first time you file taxes after you\u2019ve had your new baby, you will be able to apply for several new tax credits, but you can only do so if you claim them as a dependent.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re going to claim your child as a dependent, you have to have a Social Security number and put that number on the return. Otherwise, the IRS is going to deny you,\" Grzes said.",
      "Usually, hospitals let you apply for a Social Security number registration. However, you can also apply online or at your local Social Security office.",
      "To alleviate some of the expenses of having children, the IRS offers several tax credits, including the Child Tax Credit, Childcare Credit and Adoption Credit. Parents also continue to qualify for the Earned Income Credit, which will continue to be based on your earned income and the number of children you have.",
      "\u201cThe Earned Income Credit clearly provides a significant refund and by having a child, you could increase the amount of income that you could earn and still qualify for that credit,\u201d Grzes said.",
      "Parents can benefit from opening tax-free accounts such as a flexible spending account or a 529 account.",
      "A flexible spending account (FSA), allows you to set aside pre-tax dollars to pay for healthcare and childcare costs, while the 529 account lets you set money aside for education expenses.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s worth making sure you are maximizing your tax opportunities,\u201d Grzes said.",

      "When the first two rounds of 10% tariffs hit, Zou Guoqing, a Chinese exporter, groaned but didn't find the barriers insurmountable. He gave up some of his profits and offered his client, a snow-bike factory in Nebraska, price cuts ranging from 5% to 10%. It seemed to work: The factory agreed to a new order of molds and parts.",
      "But when President Donald Trump announced an additional 34% universal tariff on Chinese goods on April 2, Zou, who\u2019s been exporting to the U.S. for more than a decade, was incredulous.",
      "\u201cThere's not a thread of feasibility,\" said Zou, who does business in the eastern Chinese city of Ningbo. \u201cIt looks like I would have no choice but give up trading with the U.S.\u201d",
      "Then came 50% more from Trump, followed by another hike \u2014 pushing the universal tariff on Chinese goods to the sky-high 145%, and Zou said he now could only hope that the two leaders can communicate. \u201cWe are pausing the shipments,\" he said, \u201cuntil the leaders talk.\u201d",
      "The 145% tariff from the United States and the retaliatory 125% tariff from China are putting businesses doing trade between the U.S. and China on edge. They're fretting not only about their next orders, but also the viability of their business if there's no quick relief. Experts are worried the decades-long trade ties that have underpinned the relationship between the world's two largest economies could be unraveling.",
      "If the high tariff is sustained for the next six months or longer, \u201cthat would actually lead to a real effective decoupling between the American and Chinese economies,\u201d said Chen Zhiwu, professor of finance at Hong Kong University Business School.",
      "Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s GeoEconomics Center, said the sky-high tariff, if kept in place, amounts to \u201calmost a trade embargo,\u201d making it impossible for China to export low-value items such as apparel to the U.S. It also would force U.S. businesses to source elsewhere, away from China, if there should be alternatives, he said.",
      "In China, the central tariff office flat-out declared there was \u201cno possibility for market acceptance\" of U.S. goods exported to China\u201d at the current tariff level.",
      "\u201cEveryone\u2019s pretty worried,\u201d said Hu Jianlong, founder of Brands Factory, a consultancy that works with Chinese companies trying to break into overseas markets. \u201cAt this point in time, there\u2019s no good way forward. This situation has not resolved ... there's no final number. And so everyone\u2019s still waiting to see how this will develop.\u201d",
      "The high-stakes tariff war has come more than 20 years after China \u2014 with the help of the United States \u2014 joined the World Trade Organization and began to see its economy soar on luring foreign investments and exporting to the U.S. and other Western markets. By last year, China-U.S. trade was $582 billion, but tensions have flared over China's widening trade imbalance with the U.S. That led to the first tariff skirmish during the first Trump term.",
      "The trade deficit has since narrowed but stayed stubbornly high, at a time when the U.S. and other Western markets have also grown concerned about another onslaught of Chinese products such as electric vehicles.",
      "During his four-year term, former President Joe Biden stressed that the U.S. was not trying to decouple from China but to \u201cde-risk.\" He took the \u201csmall-yard, high-fence\u201d approach, under which his administration put up barriers in targeted sectors such as advanced chips, artificial intelligence and quantum computing that have national security implications.",
      "Now, Trump is declaring universal tariffs on all Chinese goods but has said he's also willing to talk with Beijing. It remains unclear what his goals might be.",
      "\u201cWhat are they looking for in those negotiations? How much is it possible to reduce these tariffs? What are the other demands apart from China removing its retaliatory tariffs that the United States wants to put forward. We don't know what that would be,\u201d said Greta Peisch, who served as the general counsel for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative in 2021-2024.",
      "The message from China's leadership is loud and clear. It will talk only when the U.S. stops \u201cmaximum pressure and capricious and destructive behavior,\" said Lin Jian, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson.",
      "Li Cheng, professor of political science at the University of Hong Kong, said the Chinese leadership is upset over being singled out by Trump when the U.S. president paused \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs for 90 days for all other countries. Beijing wants to make sure that \u201cDonald Trump not state one thing in the morning and say other things in the evening,\" Li said, and that Trump's policies on China are not hijacked by his anti-China, hawkish advisers.",
      "With no leadership-level negotiations in the immediate future, businesses are exploring their options.",
      "Lisa Li, who works in sales for an athletic wear manufacturer in the northern Chinese province of Hebei, said her business was negotiating with clients over whether they could split the increased costs. It's too early to say if her company is to give up on the U.S. market, she said, but it will \u201cdefinitely expand other avenues for sales,\u201d such as in Australia or Europe.",
      "In the eastern Chinese city of Wenzhou, a manufacturing hub, a holiday lights maker was less optimistic. Bo, who shared only his surname out of concern for retaliation, said he could \u201conly give up\u201d if the tariff hikes were here to stay because other markets might not work.",
      "\u201cIn the past few years, the European market has been in a slump,\u201d Bo said. \u201cSo we had wanted to try and develop our business in the United States.\u201d",
      "In Hong Kong, Danny Lau, who runs an aluminum-coating factory in the nearby southern Chinese city of Dongguan, said one of his U.S clients would keep buying from him for an ongoing project but was unsure about the next project. Another client told Lau that the chances are slim to strike a deal when tariffs are so high. Lau has been exploring other markets, but he says it's not easy because some may find his high-quality products too expensive.",
      "At a port in the Chinese city of Shanghai, ships heading to the U.S. had almost vanished by Thursday, the day after Trump's tariff on China took effect, according to a report by the financial news site Caixin. Major shipping lines were drastically cutting back on trans-Pacific routes, the report said.",
      "For the longer term, the tariff war is likely to prompt Chinese businesses to diversify their supply chains and move part of their manufacturing capacity outside of China, and even to the United States, said Hu, the consultant.",
      "Some might follow in the footsteps of the Tianjin steelmaking business, which gave up trading with the U.S. after both Trump and Biden raised tariffs on Chinese steel. \u201cThe best plan is to not come into contact,\u201d said David Yu, who works in the company's foreign sales department.",
      "However, not everyone is ready to give up on the U.S. market. Zou, the exporter in Ningbo, describes the U.S. market as \u201creliable and without finicky demands.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's the best market on Earth,\u201d he said. \"I am waiting for the rainbow after the storm.\u201d",

      "Argentina's statistics agency says that monthly inflation has accelerated to its fastest pace in seven months, with consumer prices up 3.7% from the month before mainly as a result of rising food prices",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Monthly inflation in Argentina accelerated in March to its fastest pace in seven months, the country's official statistics agency reported on Friday, with consumer prices up 3.7% from the month before mainly as a result of rising food prices.",
      "The steep hike, compared to a 2.4% inflation rate for February, surprised financial analysts and worried Argentines who have become increasingly concerned that President Javier Milei's progress on lowering price increases might be stalling. The last time inflation rose this much on a monthly basis was in August 2024, when prices jumped 4.2%.",
      "The inflation numbers come at a critical juncture for South America's second-biggest economy. Earlier this week, the International Monetary Fund announced a new $20 billion loan agreement with Argentina. The IMF\u2019s executive board is expected to vote on the program later Friday.",
      "While Milei considers the IMF deal crucial to his efforts to stabilize Argentina's long troubled economy, the still-vague agreement has spread jitters among traders who expect that Argentina will have to impose a new monetary and foreign-exchange policy as a condition of receiving the cash. But further devaluing the peso, now pegged to the U.S. dollar, risks capital flight and even higher inflation.",
      "Milei came to power in December 2023 with a pledge to pull Argentina out of its yearslong inflationary spiral.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping global tariffs could cause planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions to drop temporarily, but that won\u2019t help the climate long-term",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping global tariffs have stirred widespread anxiety about a severe economic downturn -- and curiosity, for some, about how it might affect the world\u2019s warming climate.",
      "Experts say a slowdown in international trade might have a brief and slight benefit in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which come in part from fuels like gas and oil that are used to move goods around the world via ships, planes and vehicles. But any such benefit in reducing emissions, which cause climate change, will be swamped by sharply rising costs worldwide that will hurt efforts to transition to green energies.",
      "\u201cI would say it might help the climate in the first year or two if we have a downturn in economic activity or a recession, which no one wants,\u201d said Rob Jackson, head of the Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists who monitor greenhouse gas emissions yearly. \u201cBut it will hurt the climate long-term because tariffs impact clean tech more than most other industries because of trade with China.",
      "\u201cAny emissions reduction would be temporary,\" said Dan Jasper, senior policy advisor at Project Drawdown. \u201cI'm deeply skeptical that this would have positive impacts on climate change and in particular the energy transition.\u201d",
      "Climate experts have closely studied changes in world economic activity the last century, from the Great Depression to the recent coronavirus pandemic, looking for insights to help shape policies to reduce carbon emissions. A major U.S.-China trade war would be a very different dynamic than other recent slowdowns, as China produces much of the equipment needed for a transition to renewable energies, such as solar panels.",
      "Trump imposed, then suspended for 90 days, import taxes on dozens of countries Wednesday. He escalated his trade war with China, raising tariffs on its products to well above 100%. China makes more than 80% of the world\u2019s solar panels.",
      "The tariffs could slow global trade and economic activity. Carbon dioxide emissions dropped during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and during the global financial crisis in 2009, then rebounded within a year.",
      "Jackson said he expects at most a 1% drop in emissions if full tariffs are implemented \u2014 significant, but far less than the 5.7% that his group calculated for the pandemic's first year. And Jackson noted that the world can't reach net-zero carbon emissions to try to limit future warming without structural changes, namely replacing fossil energy and manufacturing with clean renewable energy.",
      "\u201cA drop in emissions is important. But it boomerangs back to the same levels or keeps increasing afterwards,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we really haven\u2019t done anything meaningful to address climate issues.\u201d",
      "Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, also thinks there could be a slight, temporary drop in greenhouse gas emissions if tariffs paralyze businesses and people aren't working. But, he said, the higher prices for components for new renewable energy facilities will make some not economical to build and there will be far fewer imports of electric vehicles, both of which will lead to more emissions.",
      "The transition to electric vehicles is an important part of the shift to clean energy to reduce emissions from road transport. The United States is a top importer of EVs and China is a top exporter.",
      "Renewable energy investor Excelsior Energy Capital announced Tuesday that it has raised just over $1 billion to continue investing equity in solar, energy storage, wind and other energy transition projects across the United States. Co-founder and managing partner Chris Moakley said they need stability and predictable costs \u2014 tariffs cause volatility.",
      "\u201cIf there is an increase in tariffs, I think there\u2019s going to be a time where we will have a slowdown,\u201d he said. \u201cThe overall economics of these investments and transactions, there's going to need to be a reset.\u201d",
      "Grid-scale batteries and solar panels, as well as power transformers, are among the hardest hit by price increases on imports, said David Shepheard, partner and energy expert at the global consultant Baringa.",
      "Combining batteries with green energy is a fast-growing climate solution. Batteries allow renewables to replace fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal, while keeping a steady flow of power when sources like wind and solar are not producing. Shepheard calculated a 55% price increase for grid-scale batteries if the tariffs are fully implemented on China, where about 80% of these batteries are manufactured, undermining the case for using solar and battery storage to satisfy a surging demand for electricity.",
      "If prices for renewables increase, the United States will turn more to fossil fuels, tying the nation to carbon-emitting power sources for decades, Shepheard added.",
      "President Joe Biden sought to lock in a trajectory for reducing the nation\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. Trump began reversing the country\u2019s energy policies his first day in office with a spate of executive orders aimed at boosting oil, gas and coal. He's also moved aggressively against clean energy technologies, including halting offshore wind lease sales in federal waters, canceling clean energy loans and threatening action against states' climate laws.",

      "Many homeowners paid privately for the testing after their insurance companies refused, revealing gaps in coverage. The group hopes the data will help residents who can\u2019t afford it to convince their insurers to cover testing and remediation.",
      "\u201cIf I can prove my community is not fit for human habitation then maybe I can show my home won\u2019t be,\u201d said Jane Lawton Potelle, founder of Eaton Fire Residents Unite.",
      "It's not easy to understand how and when it is safe to return home, Lawton Potelle said. The fine print of insurance policies can be frustrating and confusing, and the government has not stepped in to help.",
      "The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it has no plans to conduct widespread environmental testing. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health is tracking environmental testing largely by academic researchers and a handful from government agencies, but most studies assess outdoor contamination.",
      "Reports from other urban wildfires, in which building materials, appliances, cars and more burn at incredibly high temperatures, show increased levels of heavy metals including lead and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as benzene that are tied to negative health risks. But insurance companies haven't standardized testing for those contaminants.",
      "Home insurance broadly covers fire damage, but there is a growing dispute over what damage must be covered when flames don't torch the property.",
      "California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara released a bulletin in March that put the onus on companies to properly investigate reported smoke damage, saying they cannot deny such claims without investigating thoroughly, including paying for professional testing as warranted. But many residents have been left to fight for coverage anyway.",
      "Janet Ruiz, spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute that represents many major insurance companies, said it's hard to compare neighbors because every claim is unique due to each home\u2019s physical structure, actual damage and defined insurance coverage limits.",
      "\u201cIt can vary and insurance companies are sensitive to what the claim is,\u201d Ruiz said. \u201cYou have to work with your insurance companies and be reasonable about what may have happened.\u201d",
      "Dave Jones, director of the Climate Risk Initiative at University of California, Berkeley, and former state insurance commissioner, said testing should be covered even though some insurance companies disagree.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly reasonable for people to have some kind of environmental test done so that their home is safe and their property is safe,\" Jones said. \"We\u2019re talking about very catastrophically high temperature fires where all sorts of materials are melted and some of them become toxic.\"",
      "The state's insurer of last resort, known as the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, has been scrutinized for years over how it handles smoke damage claims. A 2017 change to the FAIR Plan limited coverage to \u201cpermanent physical changes,\u201d meaning smoke damage must be visible or detectable without lab testing for claims to be approved. State officials said that threshold was too high and illegal, and ordered a change.",
      "Dylan Schaffer, an attorney leading a class action lawsuit challenging FAIR Plan\u2019s threshold, said he was surprised private carriers are disputing similar fire damage claims.",
      "\u201cThe damage is not due to smoke, the damage is contamination from fire,\u201d Schaffer said. \u201cThey make it complicated because it saves them money.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Altadena residents on the FAIR Plan say their claims are still being denied. Jones believes the debate will only end when lawmakers take action.",
      "FAIR Plan spokeswoman Hilary McLean declined to comment on the ongoing litigation and individual cases, but said the FAIR Plan pays all covered claims based on the adjusters\u2019 recommendations.",
      "\u201cOur policy, like many others, requires direct physical loss for there to be coverage,\u201d McLean said.",
      "Lawton Potelle said the first inkling that her house might be toxic came after meeting with her AAA insurance adjuster in the days after the fire. Even though she had worn a mask, her chest still ached and her voice rasped, and she wondered whether her home was safe for her 11-year-old.",
      "Stephanie Wilcox said her toddler\u2019s pediatrician recommended testing their home. Her Farmers Insurance policy includes coverage for lead and asbestos in addition to her wildfire coverage, but after multiple denials, she paid out of pocket.",
      "\u201cAfter the initial inspection, (Farmers) had told us remediation would cost about $12,000 and that it would be habitable, like we could move back in tomorrow,\u201d she said. \"But now there\u2019s no way.\u201d",
      "She plans to ask for a new estimate including lead abatement and other costs, citing the results.",
      "Similarly, Zach Bailey asked in late January for contamination testing. The house he shares with his wife and toddler sits in an island of largely spared homes among blocks wiped out by the fire. After months of denials, State Farm agreed to pay for lead and asbestos testing because the remediation company cited federal worker safety regulations.",
      "It shouldn't have been that hard, he said.",
      "\u201cIt feels like the insurance companies should have a playbook at this point,\" he said. \u201cThey should have a process to keep people safe because this isn\u2019t the first disaster like this.\u201d",

      "The visit comes at a complex moment for Europe and China. The tariffs announced last week \u2014 and then paused \u2014 by U.S. President Donald Trump could mean that the European Union pursues more trade with China \u2014 the world\u2019s third-largest consumer market after the United States and the EU.",

      "Musk and Saudi Arabia have had a complicated history. Back in 2018, the Tesla CEO claimed he had secured funding from the kingdom\u2019s sovereign wealth fund to take the company private. That deal never happened, leading to lingering tensions.",
      "With the launch of its first showroom and service center in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, Tesla makes its long-anticipated entry into the Saudi market.

      "\"Tesla is one of the most important EV companies in the world, so it\u2019s a big deal to have them present in our market,\u201d he added.",
      "However, the kingdom still faces significant challenges in infrastructure, with a limited number of public EV charging stations available. The government has announced plans to expand charging networks as part of its sustainability goals.",
      "Musk has a large fan base in the kingdom, praised by many for his creativity and innovation, and seen as a visionary of the future.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s always looking ahead,\" said Mohammed Osama, a teenager who describes himself as enthusiastic about everything Tesla. \"Maybe a few things don\u2019t make sense right now, but in the future, it\u2019ll all come together \u2014 he\u2019s building something bigger.\u201d",

      "Though Tesla has faced criticism and even vandalism in parts of the United States and elsewhere, after Musk took a prominent role in President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.

      "Still, many in Saudi Arabia believe that won't impact Tesla's performance in the kingdom.",

      "American shrimpers have been hammered in recent years by cheap imports flooding the U.S. market and restaurants, driving down prices to the point that profits are razor thin or shrimpers are losing money and struggling to stay afloat.",
      "Tariffs, they hope, could level the playing field and help their businesses not just survive but thrive.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been tough the last several years that we\u2019ve tried to fight through this,\" said Reed Bowers, owner of Bowers Shrimp Farm in Palacios, Texas. Tough times meant difficult choices for many. \"Cutting people off, laying people off, or reduce hours or reduce wages ... whatever we can do to survive.\"",
      "Since 2021, the price of imported shrimp has dropped by more than $1.5 billion, according to the Southern Shrimpers Alliance trade association, causing the U.S. shrimp industry to lose nearly 50% of its market value.",
      "The shrimpers alliance complains that the overseas industry has benefitted from billions of dollars invested in shrimp aquaculture, cheap or even forced labor, use of antibiotics banned in the U.S., and few or no environment regulations.",
      "More than 90% of shrimp consumed in the U.S. is imported, according to the alliance.",

      "But Trump's tariffs will also force shrimpers to balance the higher costs of equipment, such as trawl cables, webbing, chains and shackles. Some of those items have recently been increasing in price, Wallis said.",
      "\"We got be careful that there\u2019s a good balance,\u201d he said.",
      "If the American shrimping industry collapses, Wallis sees a future where foreign trawlers are operating in the Gulf of Mexico, which Trump renamed the \u201c Gulf of America. \u201d",

      "BILLINGS, Mont. -- President Donald Trump's nominee to oversee an agency that manages a quarter-billion acres of public land has withdrawn her nomination following revelations that she criticized the Republican president in 2021 for inciting the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "The withdrawal of Kathleen Sgamma to lead the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management was announced Thursday morning at the start of her confirmation hearing before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.",
      "David Bernhardt, who served as interior secretary in Trump\u2019s first term, suggested on X that Sgamma\u2019s withdrawal was \u201cself-inflicted\u201d and he included a link to a website that posted her 2021 comments. Bernhardt indicated that people whose views don\u2019t align with Trump\u2019s should not seek political appointments in his administration.",
      "\u201cI am disgusted by the violence witnessed yesterday and President Trump\u2019s role in spreading misinformation that incited it,\u201d Sgamma said in the comments earlier reported by Documented, which describes itself as a watchdog journalism project.",
      "Sgamma confirmed her withdrawal on LinkedIn and said it was an honor to have been nominated.",
      "\u201cI remain committed to President Trump and his unleashing American energy agenda and ensuring multiple-use access for all,\u201d said Sgamma. Since 2006 she's been with the Denver-based Western Energy Alliance, an oil industry trade group, and has been a vocal critic of the energy policies of Democratic administrations.",
      "White House spokesperson Liz Huston said the administration looked forward to naming another nominee but did not offer a timeline.",
      "The longtime oil and gas industry representative appeared well-poised to carry out Trump's plans to roll back restrictions on energy development, including in Western states where the land bureau has vast holdings. The agency also oversees mining, grazing and recreation.",
      "Sgamma's withdrawal underscored the Trump administration's creation of a \u201cloyalty test\u201d to weed out subordinates who are out of step with him, said Aaron Weiss, deputy director of the left-leaning Center for Western Priorities.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the world we're in \u2014 if that\u2019s what happened \u2014 where being sane and acknowledging reality with the White House is enough to sink a nomination,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump has been testing how far Republicans are willing to go in supporting his supercharged \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d agenda. Few Republicans have criticized Trump after his sweeping pardons of supporters, including violent rioters, charged in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.",
      "Most congressional Republicans have played down the potential negative impact of Trump\u2019s actions, including widespread tariffs on U.S. allies, and have stressed the importance of uniting behind him.",
      "The Bureau of Land Management plays a central role in a long-running debate over the best use of government-owned lands, and its policies have swung sharply as control of the White House has shifted between Republicans and Democrats. Under President Joe Biden, a Democrat, it curbed oil drilling and coal mining on federal lands while expanding renewable power. The agency under Biden also moved to put conservation on more equal footing with oil drilling and other extractive industries in a bid to address climate change.",
      "Trump is reversing the land bureau's course yet again.",
      "On Thursday, officials announced that they will not comprehensively analyze environmental impacts from oil and gas leases on a combined 5,500 square miles (14,100 square kilometers) of bureau land in Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming. The leases were sold to companies between 2015 and 2020 but have been tied up by legal challenges.",
      "Also this week, Trump signed an executive order aimed at boosting coal production. That will end the Biden administration's ban on new federal coal sales on bureau lands in Wyoming and Montana, the nation's largest coal fields.",
      "The land bureau had about 10,000 employees at the start of Trump\u2019s second term, but at least 800 employees have been laid off or resigned amid efforts by the Trump administration to downsize the federal workforce.",
      "It went four years without a confirmed director during Trump's first term. Trump moved the agency\u2019s headquarters to Colorado before it was returned to Washington, D.C., under Biden.",
      "Senate energy committee Chairman Mike Lee said he would work with the administration to find a new nominee for the bureau.",
      "\"Its work directly impacts millions of Americans \u2014 especially in the West \u2014 and its leadership matters,\" the Utah Republican said.",
      "Utah officials last year launched a legal effort to wrest control of Bureau of Land Management property from the federal government and put it under state control. They were turned down by the U.S. Supreme Court.",

      "In the aftermath of Wednesday\u2019s tariff whiplash, President Donald Trump is deciding exactly what he wants out of trade talks with as many as 75 nations in the coming weeks",
      "WASHINGTON -- In the aftermath of this week's tariff whiplash, President Donald Trump is deciding exactly what he wants out of trade talks with as many as 75 nations in the coming weeks.",
      "Trump is also figuring out next steps with China. He upped his tariffs on Chinese goods to 145% after China placed retaliatory taxes of 84% on imports from the U.S. While his 90-day pause on other tariffs caused the stock market to rally on Wednesday, countries still face a baseline 10% import tax instead of the higher rates announced on April 2.",
      "\u201cThere will be a transition cost and transition problems,\u201d Trump said at Thursday's Cabinet meeting. \u201cBut in the end it\u2019s going to be a beautiful thing.\u201d",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, told Fox News\u2019 \u201cFox and Friends\" on Thursday that the administration already has \u201coffers on the table from more than 15 countries.\u201d",
      "Hassett said the next step will be determining exactly what Trump wants out of the negotiations.",
      "\u201cWe have a meeting today with all the top principals where we\u2019re going to present to the president a list of what we think his priorities might look like,\" Hassett said. \"And I\u2019m sure he\u2019s going to, you know, have his own ideas about where to move things.\u201d",
      "Here's a look at where Trump's tariffs showdown stands:",
      "With $28.9 trillion in publicly held debt, the U.S. government can still be beholden to the investors who lend it money. Trump might be willing to run roughshod over political rivals, judges he dislikes and a host of political norms, but the bond market showed that it can temper his plans.",
      "Going into Wednesday, the interest rate on a 10-year U.S. Treasury note was increasing and approaching 4.5%. That meant the U.S. government was having a tough time finding possible buyers for its debt, as market participants were wondering if Trump's tariffs had caused foreign buyers to sour on the U.S. government. Higher interest rates for the government could trigger even higher mortgage rates and auto loans for consumers, among other problems.",
      "Trump on Wednesday said investors were getting \u201cyippy,\u201d but after his tariff pause he described the bond market as \u201cbeautiful.\u201d",
      "The S&P 500 stock index jumped 9.5% after the pause was announced. But reality crept back in Thursday and the S&P 500 slumped nearly 3.5% as interest rates on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose. Sure, Trump was no longer going to put a 20% tariff on goods from the European Union, a 24% tariff on Japan or 25% on South Korea. But those nations still have imports taxed at an elevated 10%, Trump's new baseline as trade talks begin. And tariffs went up against China, locking the world's two largest economies in a trade war.",
      "Plus, the trade war has expanded with China, and 25% tariffs still apply to imported autos, steel and aluminum. Imports from Canada and Mexico, the two largest U.S. trading partners, still face tariffs of as much as 25%. And Trump still plans tariffs on pharmaceutical drugs, lumber, copper and computer chips.",
      "\u201cWhile we appreciate the pause, the reciprocal tariff of 10% still represents more than double the tariff on imports of leather footwear from countries like Vietnam and Cambodia,\u201d said Tom Florsheim, CEO of the Weyco Group, a footwear company. \u201cEven at this level, it means a significant cost increase that will impact consumers.\u201d",
      "Because tariffs are taxes paid by importers, the costs generally get passed along to consumers and businesses in the form of higher prices. The Budget Lab at Yale University estimated Thursday that even with the pause, Trump's current tariff regime would pull down a household's average disposable income by $4,364.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said any trade agreements will be \u201cbespoke\u201d deals, rather than some overarching pact among a group of countries. Trump has laid out a series of grievances and goals regarding tariffs, but Canadian and European counterparts have said the actual asks from administration officials have been vague so far.",
      "Trump has said he wants to eliminate the $1.2 trillion trade deficit, which means he no longer wants the U.S. to import more goods than it exports to other nations. He also wants revenues from tariffs to offset his income tax cut plans. The president has also said he wants the tariffs to bring back factory jobs and raise workers\u2019 wages.",
      "Aides have said Trump wants other nations to scrap regulations and other policies, such as Europe's value-added taxes, that he deems to be a barrier to U.S. goods, an ask that would require other countries to change their laws. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said the goal is to get other nations to \u201crespect\u201d Trump.",
      "His goals might not necessarily be in line with what other nations want.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen posted on X that she's \u201cconsistently advocated for a zero-for-zero tariff agreement between the European Union and the United States.\u201d",
      "Lori Wallach, director of the Rethink Trade program at the American Economic Liberties Project, said Trump needs to be more publicly forthright about what he wants out of trade talks and tariffs.",
      "\u201cAbsent transparency about what is being demanded, we could end up with the worst of all outcomes \u2014 a bunch of bad special interest deals, all of the economic damage caused by tariff uncertainty and no trade rebalancing, U.S. manufacturing capacity or goods jobs,\u201d she said.",
      "The Trump administration views China as violating basic trade norms with how it subsidizes its manufacturers, takes intellectual property from its global competitors, suppresses wages for its workers and manipulates its currency.",
      "The White House clarified that the 125% tariffs that Trump announced Wednesday against China were actually 145%, once his previous 20% fentanyl tariffs were included.",
      "Census Bureau data show the U.S. ran a $295 billion trade deficit last year with China. Because U.S. consumers and businesses are such a major customer of Chinese manufacturers, Bessent has said that gives the U.S. an edge in terms of inflicting pain on that nation's economy through tariffs. Of course, China has also spent several years preparing for a trade war.",
      "Trump at his Cabinet meeting expressed hope that he could get an agreement with China, though he didn't offer any specifics on what he was seeking.",
      "\u201cWell, we\u2019ll see what happens with China,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI would love to be able to work a deal.\u201d",
      "Wendong Zhang, an economist at Cornell University, said the Chinese economy might suffer a steeper hit to its gross domestic product than the U.S., but it's \u201clikely to stick to its guns\u201d due to internal public support and the ability to increase consumption domestically on goods that might no longer be going to the U.S.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump will need to deal with voters who might be frustrated over the higher price of electronics and other goods resulting from the trade wars.",
      "\u201cMany products that the U.S. imports are predominantly from China: smartphones (73%), laptops (78%), video game consoles (87%), toys (77%), and also antibiotics for U.S. livestock production,\" Zhang said in an email. \u201cResourcing from other countries will take time and result in much higher costs.\u201d",

      "House Speaker Mike Johnson is vowing to try again to pass the Republican budget framework after abruptly postponing Wednesday night's vote",
      "WASHINGTON -- After abruptly halting votes, House Speaker Mike Johnson vowed to try again Thursday to approve a Republican budget framework, having worked into the night to satisfy GOP holdouts who refused to advance trillions of dollars in tax breaks without deeper spending cuts.",
      "Even a hefty push from President Donald Trump couldn't heave the package to approval. Johnson was forced to abandon Wednesday's scheduled action as the Republican hardliners left him without enough support, and risked upending what the president calls the \u201cbig, beautiful bill,\" which is central to his agenda of tax cuts, mass deportations and a smaller federal government.",
      "\u201cThe president is very anxious for us to get this done,\u201d Johnson, R-La., said as he left a late-night meeting with the GOP lawmakers. He said he expects votes on Thursday.",
      "Pushing the budget framework forward would log another milestone for Johnson, who can only lose a few detractors from his slim majority. A failed vote, particularly as the economy was convulsing over Trump\u2019s trade wars, would be a major setback for the Republican agenda in Washington.",
      "\u201cStop grandstanding!\u201d Trump had admonished Republicans during a black-tie fundraising dinner at the National Building Museum earlier in the week.",
      "Trump told the Republicans, \"Close your eyes and get there.\u201d",
      "But by Wednesday afternoon, the outcome was in flux. At least a dozen conservative Republicans, if not more, stood firmly against the plan. Several of them, including members of the ultraconservative Freedom Caucus, made the unusual move of walking across the Capitol to meet privately with Senate GOP leaders to insist on deeper cuts.",
      "As night fell, Johnson pulled a group of Republicans into a private meeting room as House proceedings came to a standstill. They stayed into the night hashing out alternatives.",
      "Johnson said he spoke with Trump for about five minutes while the GOP meeting was taking place. The GOP speaker said they're trying to figure out the minimal number of cuts and savings \u201cthat will satisfy everyone.\u201d",
      "Options include amending the Senate bill or having a conference committee work out the differences, among others. \"There\u2019s a few different ideas on the table,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "\u201cWe want everybody to have a high degree of comfort about what is happening here, and we have a small subset of members who weren\u2019t totally satisfied with the product as it stands,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "But House GOP conservatives, including several of those who met personally with Trump at the White House this week, remained concerned that the Senate GOP's blueprint, approved last weekend, does not slash spending to the level they believe is necessary to help prevent soaring deficits.",
      "\u201cThe Math Does Not Add Up,\u201d Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, posted on social media. He said he would not support it.",
      "Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., the chair of the Freedom Caucus, led others to met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and other top Senate Republicans.",
      "\u201cAll we can do is make sure that they understand where we\u2019re coming from and how close we want to work with them to get to the final product,\u201d Thune said afterward.",
      "But the Senate GOP leader panned the idea of the House sending back an amended version, which would require another potential all-night voting session like the one senators endured last weekend. \u201cWe can\u2019t do that \u2014 another vote-a-rama, that drags it on indefinitely,\u201d Thune said.",
      "The House and Senate are still at the beginning phase of a process that will take weeks, if not months, as they turn their budget resolutions into legislative text \u2014 a final product with more votes ahead later this spring or summer.",
      "Democrats, in the minority, do not have enough votes to stop the package, but have warned against it.",
      "House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said the Republicans' budget plan is reckless and callous as it proposes slashing budgets to give tax breaks to the wealthy.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re here to make it clear,\u201d Jeffries said. \u201cHands off everyday Americans struggling to make ends meet.\u201d",
      "Central to the budget framework is the Republican effort to preserve the tax breaks approved in 2017, during Trump's first term, while potentially adding the new ones he promised on the campaign trail. That includes no taxes on tipped wages, Social Security income and others, ballooning the price tag to some $7 trillion over the decade.",
      "The package also allows for budget increases with some $175 billion to pay for Trump's mass deportation operation and as much for the Defense Department to bolster military spending.",
      "It all would be partly paid for with steep cuts to domestic programs, including health care, as part of the $2 trillion in reductions outlined in the House GOP version of the package, though several GOP senators have signaled they are not willing to go that far.",
      "To clip costs, the Senate is using an unusual accounting method that does not count the costs of preserving the 2017 tax cuts, some $4.5 trillion, as new spending, another factor that is enraging the House conservatives.",
      "Two Republican senators voted against their package during an overnight weekend session \u2014 Maine Sen. Susan Collins objected to steep cuts to Medicaid in the House's framework, while Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul argued the whole package relied on \u201cfishy\u201d math that would add to the debt.",
      "The package would also boost the nation's debt limit to allow more borrowing to pay the bills. Trump had wanted lawmakers to take the politically difficult issue off the table. With debt now at $36 trillion, the Treasury Department has said it will run out of funds by August.",
      "But the House and Senate need to resolve their differences on the debt limit, as well. The House GOP raises the debt limit by $4 trillion, but the Senate GOP boosted it to $5 trillion so Congress would not have to revisit the issue again until after the fall 2026 midterm election.",
      "With Trump's trade wars hovering over the debate, House Republicans tucked a provision into a procedural vote that would prevent House action \u2014 as the Senate has taken \u2014 to disapprove of Trump\u2019s tariffs.",

      "Lee, who narrowly lost the 2022 election to Yoon, led the liberal Democratic Party\u2019s campaign to oust the former president over his December declaration of martial law.",
      "Lee recently stepped down as the party\u2019s chairman to focus on campaigning for the June 3 election. He is considered the clear front-runner in party's primary. Kim Dong-yeon, the Democratic governor of Gyeonggi province and a longtime financial policymaker, also told reporters Wednesday that he intends to run for president.",
      "Yoon\u2019s downfall has left the conservative People Power Party in disarray, with roughly 10 politicians expected to seek the nomination, reflecting a split between Yoon loyalists, who still control the party\u2019s leadership, and reformists calling for a fresh start.",
      "In a video message, Lee said that Yoon\u2019s martial law saga exposed the country\u2019s deep divisions and social conflicts, and argued that the root cause was a widening rich-poor gap. He promised aggressive government spending to jolt economic growth and ease income polarization.",
      "\u201cWe have more than we did in the past, but wealth is too concentrated in certain areas,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWith economic growth rates declining worldwide, it has become difficult to maintain and develop an economy solely on the strength of the private sector. However, with government-led talent development and extensive investments in technological research and development, we can revive the economy.\u201d",
      "Lee said it was crucial to maintain a robust alliance with the United States and to pursue three-way cooperation with Japan, but he stressed that South Korea\u2019s national interest should come first in \u201cevery decision.\u201d",
      "Lee, who has served as a lawmaker, provincial governor and city mayor, is adored by supporters for his outspoken style and has long positioned himself as an anti-elitist. His critics view him as a populist who stokes division and demonizes conservative opponents while failing to offer realistic funding plans to achieve his ambitious goals.",
      "Kweon Seong-dong, PPP floor leader and a staunch Yoon loyalist, said that if Lee becomes president, he will \u201cruthlessly wield the sword of dogmatism and retribution\u201d and further deepen the country\u2019s divisions.",
      "Lee also has his own set of legal troubles, facing five different trials for corruption and other criminal charges.",
      "Earlier this month, the Constitutional Court upheld Yoon\u2019s impeachment by the legislature and formally removed him from office over the martial law decree, triggering a presidential by-election within 60 days. The next president will serve a full 5-year term.",
      "Former PPP leader Han Dong-hoon, head of the party\u2019s anti-Yoon faction, announced his presidential bid Thursday, positioning himself as a conservative who opposed martial law and appealing to centrist voters to stop the inauguration of a populist \u201cmonster government\u201d led by Lee. Among the conservatives\u2019 presidential hopefuls, former Labor Minister Kim Moon Soo is considered to be the most pro-Yoon.",
      "Kim, Daegu Mayor Hong Joon-pyo and senior PPP lawmaker Ahn Cheol-soo \u2014 a former computer software entrepreneur who finished third in the 2017 presidential vote \u2014 have declared their intentions to run for president. Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon is expected to enter the race later.",

    "story": [
      "The 29 vehicles in a Rolls-Royce and Bentley museum outside Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, are getting the best of care in their golden years",
      "MECHANICSBURG, Pa. -- Mike Fowler had been faintly aware that a museum of Rolls-Royce and Bentley vehicles existed near his boyhood home in the suburbs of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, but the car enthusiast didn't expect the experience he got when he started volunteering there.",
      "Fowler had oil on his hands within a half-hour of his first volunteer session at the Rolls-Royce and Bentley Museum. More than a year later, he keeps a list on his phone with notes about cars in the collection to help him get them started properly or disconnect their batteries.",
      "Fowler is part of a group of about 50 volunteers who gather twice a month at the museum to help out, including cleaning, maintaining and driving the fleet of customized iconic vehicles, many designed to be driven by a chauffeur. For many volunteers, it\u2019s an opportunity to experience a life few people can afford.",
      "\u201cYou take it out on the road and you are transported to a different time, a different mentality,\u201d said Fowler, a 28-year-old Camp Hill resident.",
      "Newcomers are first paired with a more experienced volunteer for about a year and must pass the museum\u2019s driving school. They start with the most modern vehicles, which have automatic transmissions.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re very protective of the collection. We\u2019re its caretakers, and we take it very seriously. So you can\u2019t just come in off the street and start driving,\u201d said Sarah Holibaugh, the museum\u2019s head librarian and archivist. \u201cBut it should be that way.\u201d",
      "The 29 antique and collectible Rolls-Royce and Bentley automobiles that date as far back as the late 1920s are the central attraction of the largely overlooked and seldom visited museum, which is easy to miss among the surrounding miles of farm fields and stretch of nondescript industrial buildings just outside Mechanicsburg. The museum, owned by the Rolls-Royce Foundation, includes a showroom, maintenance area and a third room being converted into a library and reading room.",
      "\u201cI often wonder if the homes around here know the foundation exists,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cOr if they always just wonder, \u2018Why do we see these vintage Rolls-Royce and Bentleys roaming around from time to time?\u2019\"",
      "The museum has its roots in nearby Harrisburg, where Rolls-Royce put an owners' club in the 1960s, located between large dealerships in New York and Washington. After Hurricane Agnes devasted that location in 1972, a businessman donated the Mechanicsburg property for a new facility. The 6,000-person owners' club, with members in 26 countries and a headquarters in the same complex, is a separate entity but works closely with the museum.",
      "Though admission is just $5, the museum launched in 2004 gets only about 1,000 visitors a year. It typically draws members of car clubs, groups of seniors and students on school field trips, with visits that have to be scheduled in advance.",
      "It also has rented out its cars for films and similar uses. The museum's 1961 Rolls-Royce Phantom V was in last year\u2019s Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet biopic about Bob Dylan, \u201cA Complete Unknown,\u201d and a 1959 Silver Cloud I from the collection appeared in Season 4 of the series \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.\u201d",
      "Volunteers also help preserve and digitize the museum's archive of ownership and service records for North America, which span from 1907 until 2004, shortly after Rolls-Royce and Bentley were acquired by BMW and Volkswagen, respectively. Records for cars made for the European market are available through the Rolls-Royce Enthusiasts\u2019 Club in the United Kingdom.",
      "The North American records, which are available for a fee and produce the foundation's biggest revenue stream, have helped prove cars outside of their collection were once owned by famed director Alfred Hitchcock, actor Zsa Zsa Gabor and hockey great Wayne Gretzky.",
      "Foundation records have also debunked claims about purported prior ownership, including a Rolls-Royce vehicle thought to have been owned by country singer Hank Williams Jr.",
      "\u201cWe were able to absolutely prove that it was not owned by him,\u201d recalled volunteer Randy Churchill, a Boiling Springs man now retired from a marketing career. \u201cThey just thought they had a million-dollar gold mine on their hands.\u201d",
      "Vehicles in the museum\u2019s collection range in value from about $30,000 to about $120,000. A whiskey delivery truck appraised at $320,000 has been donated and will soon be on display.",
      "Many of the cars Rolls-Royce has built are still on the road and used models can be surprisingly cheap. But maintaining an older Rolls, with its customized features and expensive parts, can be pricey, noted volunteer Ron Deguffroy, a retired psychologist from Chambersburg.",
      "\u201cThe most expensive Rolls-Royce you will buy,\" he said, \u201cis a cheap one.\u201d",

      "A new executive order from President Donald Trump that's part of his effort to invigorate energy production launches the possibility that his Department of Justice will go to court against state laws aimed at slashing planet-warming greenhouse gas poll...",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- A new executive order from President Donald Trump that's part of his effort to invigorate energy production raises the possibility that his Department of Justice will go to court against state climate change laws aimed at slashing planet-warming greenhouse gas pollution from fossil fuels.",
      "Trump\u2019s order, signed Tuesday, comes as U.S. electricity demand ramps up to meet the growth of artificial intelligence and cloud computing applications, as well as federal efforts to expand high-tech manufacturing. It also coincides with \u201cclimate superfund\u201d legislation gaining traction in various states.",
      "Trump has declared a \u201c national energy emergency \" and ordered his attorney general to take action against states that may be illegally overreaching their authority in how they regulate energy development.",
      "\u201cAmerican energy dominance is threatened when State and local governments seek to regulate energy beyond their constitutional or statutory authorities,\u201d Trump said in the order.",
      "He said the attorney general should focus on state laws targeting climate change, a broad order that unmistakably puts liberal states in the crosshairs of Trump's Department of Justice.",
      "Michael Gerrard, director of the Columbia University\u2019s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, said it would be an \u201cextraordinarily bold move\u201d for the federal government to go to court to try to overturn a state climate law.",
      "Gerrard said the quickest path for Trump's Department of Justice is to try to join ongoing lawsuits where courts are deciding whether states or cities are exceeding their authority by trying to force the fossil fuel industry to pay for the cost of damages from climate change.",
      "Democratic governors vowed to keep fighting climate change.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom accused Trump of \u201cturning back the clock\u201d on the climate and said his state's efforts to reduce pollution \u201cwon\u2019t be derailed by a glorified press release masquerading as an executive order.\u201d",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, cochairs of the U.S. Climate Alliance, which includes 22 governors, said they \u201cwill keep advancing solutions to the climate crisis.\"",
      "Vermont and New York are currently fighting challenges in federal courts to climate superfund laws passed last year. Trump suggested the laws \u201cextort\u201d payments from energy companies and \u201cthreaten American energy dominance and our economic and national security.\u201d",
      "Both are modeled on the 45-year-old federal superfund law, which taxed petroleum and chemical companies to pay to clean up of sites polluted by toxic waste. In similar fashion, the state climate laws are designed to force major fossil fuel companies to pay into state-based funds based on their past greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "Several other Democratic-controlled states, including New Jersey, Massachusetts, Oregon and California, are considering similar measures.",
      "The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the oil and natural gas industries, applauded Trump\u2019s order that it said would \u201cprotect American energy from so-called \u2018climate superfunds.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cDirecting the Department of Justice to address this state overreach will help restore the rule of law and ensure activist-driven campaigns do not stand in the way of ensuring the nation has access to an affordable and reliable energy supply,\" it said.",
      "The American Petroleum Institute, along with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, filed the lawsuit against Vermont. The lawsuit against New York was filed by West Virginia, along with several coal, gas and oil interests and 21 other mostly Republican-led states, including Texas, Ohio and Georgia.",
      "Make Polluters Pay, a coalition of consumer and anti-fossil fuel groups, vowed to fight Trump's order and accused fossil fuel billionaires of convincing Trump to launch an assault on states.",
      "The order, it said, demonstrates the \u201ccorporate capture of government\u201d and \u201cweaponizes the Justice Department against states that dare to make polluters pay for climate damage.\u201d",
      "Separately, the Department of Justice could join lawsuits in defense of fossil fuel industries being sued, Gerrard said.",
      "Those lawsuits include ones filed by Honolulu, Hawaii, and dozens of cities and states seeking billions of dollars in damages from things like wildfires, rising sea levels and severe storms.",
      "In the last three months, the U.S. Supreme Court has declined to get involved in a couple climate-themed lawsuits.",
      "One was brought by oil and gas companies asking it to block Honolulu's lawsuit. Another was brought by Alabama and Republican attorneys general in 18 other states aimed at blocking lawsuits against the oil and gas industry from Democratic-led states, including California, Connecticut, Minnesota, New Jersey and Rhode Island.",
      "Trump\u2019s order set off talk in state Capitols around the U.S.",
      "That includes Pennsylvania, where the governor is contesting a court challenge to a regulation that would make it the first major fossil fuel-producing state to force power plant owners pay for greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "John Quigley, a former Pennsylvania environmental protection secretary and a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Kleinman Center for Energy Policy, wondered if the Department of Justice would begin challenging all sorts of state water and air pollution laws.",
      "\u201cThis kind of an order knows no bounds,\" Quigley said. \"It's hard to say where this could end up.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Inflation likely declined last month as the cost of energy, used cars and hotel rooms may have fallen, though President Donald Trump's remaining tariffs could lift prices soon.",
      "Consumer prices probably rose 2.6% in March from a year ago, the Labor Department is expected to report Thursday, according to economists' projections compiled by FactSet. That would be down from February's yearly gain of 2.8%. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, prices are expected to have risen 3%, down from 3.1% in February.",
      "The projected figures, if accurate, would suggest inflation is starting to cool again after remaining elevated for most of the fall and winter. Core inflation was stuck at 3.3% for five months before declining in February.",
      "Still, inflation remains above the 2% target set by the inflation-fighters at the Federal Reserve. And on a monthly basis, core prices are forecast to rise 0.3% in March. If sustained, price increases at that pace would easily top the Fed's target. Overall prices are expected to tick up just 0.1% in March, however. Economists pay closer attention to the core figures because they provide a better guide to where inflation is headed.",
      "Most economists had forecast higher inflation this year as a result of the sweeping tariffs on 60 nations that President Donald Trump announced last week. Yet on Wednesday, Trump paused those duties for 90 days. A universal tariff of 10% remains in place, as well as 25% duties on steel, aluminum, cars and many items from Canada and Mexico.",
      "And import taxes on China have been ramped up to 125%, after China retaliated against Trump's earlier decisions to place large duties on imports from China.",
      "Even with the pause, many companies are still uncertain where trade policy will go next. Trump has also said that duties on pharmaceutical imports will be imposed.",
      "Consumers will likely see some prices rise because of the existing duties, including the massive tariffs on China. The United States imports more than $60 billion of iPhones and other mobile phones every year from China, as well as massive amounts of clothes, shoes and toys.",
      "Many U.S. companies will likely shift production out of China, a process that had already started during Trump's first term when he slapped duties on some of its exports. Still, China remains the Unite States' third-largest trading partner.",
      "Shifting supply chains out of China, however, will likely take time and come with its own costs, which could raise prices for U.S. consumers in the coming months.",
      "Last week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said that the central bank was likely to keep its key interest rate unchanged at about 4.3% as it waited to see how Trump's policies impacted the economy. Trump called for the Fed to cut rates on Friday.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of waiting and seeing going on, including by us,\u201d Powell said. \u201cAnd that just seems like the right thing to do in this period of uncertainty.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump delivered another jarring reversal in American trade policy Wednesday, suspending for 90 days import taxes he\u2019d imposed barely 13 hours earlier on dozens of countries while escalating his trade war with China. The moves triggered a powerful stock market rally on Wall Street but left businesses, investors and America\u2019s trading partners bewildered about what the president is attempting to achieve.",
      "The U-turn came after the sweeping global tariffs Trump announced last week set off a four-day route in global financial markets, paralyzed businesses and raised fears the U.S. and world economies would tumble into recession.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt tried to characterize the sudden change in policy as part of a grand negotiating strategy. But to those outside the Trump administration, it looked like a cave-in to market pressure and to growing fears that the president\u2019s impetuous use of import taxes -- tariffs -- would cause massive collateral economic damage.",
      "\u201cOther countries will welcome the 90-day stay of execution \u2014 if it lasts \u2014 but the whiplash from constant zig-zags creates more of the uncertainty that businesses and governments hate,\u201d said Daniel Russel, vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute. \u201cThe Administration\u2019s blunt-force tactics have rattled allies, who see the sudden reversal as damage control following the market meltdown, rather than a pivot to respectful, balanced negotiations.\u2019\u2019",
      "Trump\u2019s turnaround Wednesday capped a wild week in U.S. trade policy. On Wednesday April 2 \u2014 which Trump labeled \u201cLiberation Day\u2019\u2019 \u2014 the president announced plans to impose tariffs on almost every country on earth, upending the world trading system. The first of his new tariffs -\u2013 a 10% \u201cbaseline\u2019\u2019 tax on imports from most countries \u2013 went into effect Saturday.",
      "At midnight Wednesday, he upped the ante by slapping what he called \u201creciprocal\u2019\u2019 taxes on countries he accused of unfair trading practices and adding to U.S. trade deficits. Those are the tariffs he suspended for 90 days, saying the pause would give countries time to negotiate with him and his trade team.",
      "There was one exception to the reprieve: He raised the tariff on Chinese imports to a staggering 125%, punishing Beijing for announcing retaliatory tariffs on the United States. Meanwhile, the 10% baseline tariffs \u2013 a substantial act of protectionism in their own right \u2013 remain in place.",
      "Trump\u2019s ever-changing trade war tactics \u2014 which include earlier levies on cars, steel and aluminum, and Mexico and Canada \u2014 have already done damage, forcing dazed companies to delay or cancel plans as they tried to figure out what Trump was doing and how they should respond.",
      "Some companies temporarily laid off workers after Trump\u2019s widespread tariffs were announced, while there were signs that many firms held off on hiring amid the widespread uncertainty the tariffs created.",
      "Carmaker Stellantis temporarily cut 900 jobs at factories in Michigan and Indiana after production was halted at two plants in Canada and Mexico in the wake of Trump's 25% duties on imported cars.",
      "And Cleveland-Cliffs laid off 1,200 workers at a factory in Michigan and an iron ore mine in Minnesota in response to a drop in demand from auto companies. Cleveland-Cliffs said it would resume production at the two facilities once auto production returned to the U.S.",
      "Minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s March 18-19 meeting, released Wednesday, showed that many of its policymakers said that their business contacts \u201creported pausing hiring decisions because of elevated policy uncertainty.\"",
      "And Delta Air Lines said earlier Wednesday that demand for domestic leisure trips and corporate travel has stalled because of the uncertainty around global trade. In a conference call with investors, the company said it was cutting capacity. It also declined to provide a full-year financial forecast.",
      "\u201cRight now, it\u2019s hard to know how this is going to play out, given that this is somewhat self-imposed,\u201d Delta CEO Ed Bastian said. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that sanity will prevail and we\u2019ll move through this period of time on the global trade front relatively quickly.\u201d",
      "Businesses have sought greater clarity around Trump's ultimate tariff policies for weeks. It's not clear that the 90-day pause has reduced their uncertainty.",
      "Jeff Jaisli, CEO of the New Jersey-based importer/exporter Jagro, said Trump\u2019s Truth Social post on Wednesday had made things \u201ceven worse\u2019\u2019 and more confusing. He was trying to figure out which tariffs applied to which countries.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re scrambling to find correct information and procedures for entries we\u2019re processing NOW in real time,\u2019\u2019 he said by email. He could find no guidance on the websites of the White House or the Customs and Border Protection agency, which collects tariffs. Earlier, Jaisli called Trump's tariffs \"a grenade that was thrown into the room that\u2019s going to cause chaos.''",
      "Trump's tariffs have set off a tit-for-tat trade war with China, the world's second-biggest economy. Even before Trump upped his taxes on China to 125%, the Chinese had set their own tariffs on the United States at 84%.",
      "The World Trade Organization's director-general, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, warned that the rising tension could reduce U.S.-China merchandise trade by 80% and \"severely damage the global economic outlook.\u201d",
      "\u201cOf particular concern is the potential fragmentation of global trade along geopolitical lines,\u201d she wrote in a statement late Wednesday. \u201cA division of the global economy into two blocs could lead to a long-term reduction in global real GDP by nearly 7%.\u201d",
      "Citing WTO projections, she warned the negative effects could ripple through to other economies, especially developing ones. She urged countries to ensure an open global trading system and resolve differences through cooperation.",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. companies struggled to figure out how to respond to huge levies on Chinese products they'd come to rely on.",
      "Jessica Bettencourt is CEO of Klem\u2019s, a third-generation store in Spencer, Massachusetts that sells everything from lawn and garden items to workwear and gifts. She said that the escalation of tariffs from China have made her stop ordering any new fourth-quarter product that is holiday, gifts or toys. She is also reconsidering any fall apparel and footwear orders that aren\u2019t already placed.",
      "\u201cThe worst thing is uncertainty and we have massive uncertainty,\u201d said Jason Goldberg, chief commerce strategy officer at Publicis Groupe, a global marketing and communications company. \u201cNo one can make any moves. Everybody is trying to save as much cash and defer any unnecessary expense. People are getting laid off. Orders are getting cancelled. Expansion plans are being put on hold.\u201d",

      "Piastri held off an unexpected challenge from Mercedes driver George Russell to take pole in qualifying Saturday in a sign McLaren is still the F1 team to beat in 2025.",
      "A team mix up cost Russell and Mercedes teammate Kimi Antonelli each one spot on the grid after penalties were imposed after the qualifying session.",

    "story": [
      "The Chicago Cubs had a big night against the defending champion Los Angeles Dodgers",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The Chicago Cubs had a big night against the defending champion Los Angeles Dodgers.",
      "One night after being shut out, the Cubs broke out for 14 runs and 15 hits in the final three innings of a 16-0 victory Saturday night, to hand the Dodgers their first home loss of the season and their worst home shutout loss in franchise history.",
      "The Cubs finished 21 hits, including nine for extra bases.",
      "\u201cThe boys came out swinging, and it was pretty cool to see,\u201d said Chicago's Carson Kelly, who homered twice among his three hits and drove in three runs. \u201cKudos to our guys for working at-bats, really working counts, getting good pitches to drive and not missing them. We also ran the bases well and took our walks \u2026 I think it\u2019s just the mentality of this team that we\u2019re gonna fight to the end no matter what the score is.\u201d",
      "Michael Busch, once a top prospect in the Dodgers\u2019 farm system, had four hits, including a homer and two doubles, and drove in three runs. The first baseman is batting .308 (12 for 39) with three homers, six doubles and 11 RBIs in 10 career games against the Dodgers.",
      "Ian Happ had three hits and scored two runs, and Miguel Amaya replaced the injured Seiya Suzuki (right-wrist pain) in the fifth inning and homered among his two hits and drove in three runs.",
      "Kelly keyed a five-run seventh inning by with a homer 384 feet over the left-field wall against Dodgers reliever Ben Casparius, and then crushed a 391-foot homer on a floater from infielder-turned-pitcher Miguel Rojas for a two-run shot in the ninth.",
      "\u201cYou have to take a quick swing, not a big swing,\u201d Kelly said, when asked how hard it is to homer off a 40-mph pitch. \u201cYou have to find the right timing of it.\u201d",
      "The Cubs pushed their major league-league-leading run total to 112, which is 21 more than the second-place New York Yankees (91), and they have outscored opponents by 41 runs, a margin nearly twice as much as any other team.",
      "Busch, who homered off Dodgers starter Roki Sasaki for a 1-0 lead in the second, came within inches of a monster game when he was robbed of a grand slam by center fielder Andy Pages to end the third.",
      "\u201cI saw him (make the catch) \u2014 unfortunately,\u201d said Busch, a former minor league teammate of Pages. \u201cHe\u2019s a good player. I didn\u2019t want him to do that, so we\u2019re gonna have to have a conversation.\u201d",
      "Sasaki (0-1) left with a 1-0 deficit after allowing one run and four hits in five innings, striking out three and walking two. However, the Cubs then broke through against a Dodgers bullpen that entered with a 2.15 ERA, the fourth-best mark in baseball.",
      "Busch doubled and scored on Justin Turner\u2019s RBI single off Casparius for a 2-0 lead in the sixth, and Amaya (single), Busch (single), Dansby Swanson (single) and Nico Hoerner (sacrifice fly) drove in runs after Kelly\u2019s leadoff homer in the seventh.",
      "Kyle Tucker had a two-run single and Amaya a two-run homer in the eighth, and the Cubs teed off on Rojas in the ninth.",
      "The offensive outburst backed a superb start by Cubs right-hander Ben Brown, who used only two pitches \u2014 a four-seam fastball that averaged 95.6 mph and a knuckle-curve that averaged 86.9 mph \u2014 to blank the Dodgers on five hits in six innings, striking out five and walking none.",
      "Brown (2-1) gave up five runs and seven hits in four innings of his previous start, a no-decision against San Diego.",
      "\u201cJust trying to do the exact opposite of last week,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThis past week was a grind working on things, mentally going through things, but I put in that effort, and it obviously showed tonight.",
      "\u201cI was able to slow the game down, slow the heart rate down, execute pitch by pitch and go back to where I was last year \u2026 when my stuff is there, we can get through lineups like that.\u201d",

      "Alexander Volkanovski reclaimed the featherweight championship early Sunday morning, defeating Diego Lopes by unanimous decision at UFC 314",
      "MIAMI -- Alexander Volkanovski reclaimed the featherweight championship early Sunday morning, defeating Diego Lopes by unanimous decision at UFC 314.",
      "Two judges scored the fight 49-46 and the other had it 48-47.",
      "Volkanovski (27-4) had successfully defended his belt four times before losing to Israel Makhachev on Feb. 11, 2023.",
      "Now he has it back.",
      "President Donald Trump, a longtime friend of UFC President and CEO Dana White and a fan of the sport, watched from the front row. Shaquille O'Neal approached Trump and shook his hand. Cabinet officials Tulsi Gabbard, Marco Rubio and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also were in attendance as was X (formerly Twitter) owner and White House adviser Elon Musk.",
      "In the co-main event, No. 12 lightweight contender Paddy Pimblett continued this rise with a technical knockout of No. 7 Michael Chandler at 3:07 of the third round. Plimbett, a 30-year-old from Liverpool, England, has won all seven of his bouts since moving to the organization, giving him a 23-3 record overall.",
      "\u201cI want that world title,\u201d Pimblett said. \u201cSome say I'll never be champ, I'll never get run, I'll never be in the top 10. But what now?\u201d",
      "At nearly 39, Chandler has some decisions to making after winning just two of his most recent seven bouts. He is 23-10.",
      "Featherweight Bryce Mitchell, who fought for the first time since praising Adolf Hitler and denying the Holocaust on a podcast, was also on the card. He later backed off his comments and though White heavily criticized Mitchell, he didn\u2019t discipline him.",
      "Mitchell was little match for Jean Silva in their featherweight fight. Silva won by submission with a guillotine choke with 1:08 left in the second round.",
      "Volkanovski, despite getting cut below his right eye in the second and being floored by an overhand right in that round, dominated the first three rounds. But Lopes' glove caught Volkanovski's other eye in the fourth round and then pounced, but failed to put him away.",
      "That set up the fifth round and, barring a knockout, Volkanovski appeared on his way to victory even though Lopes spent much of the fight verbally challenging him and inviting him to box. Theatrics to the contrary, Volkanovski was the aggressor.",
      "Volkanovski had hoped to get another shot at Ilia Topuria and avenge his loss from more than a year ago at UFC 298. But Topuria moved up to the lightweight division, leaving the featherweight class vacant.",
      "In stepped Lopes, the third-ranked challenger, to take on Volkanovski.",
      "This was the 10th consecutive title fight for Volkanovski, the 36-year-old top-ranked contender from Australia. Lopes, a 30-year-old from Brazil, was in first title bout.",
      "Volkanovski was a -160 favorite at BetMGM Sportsbook to defeat Lopes (26-7), whose five-match winning streak ended.",
      "In preparing for Lopes, Volkanovski said he fully committed himself by beginning training camp earlier than usual and focusing on the workout recovery process and dieting in addition to the physical demands. He said he has never been this lean going into a bout.",
      "Volkanovski had plenty of reason for wanting to get to work. He took an extended layoff after losing in February 2024 to Topuria. More than that, he\u2019s coming off defeats in three of his past four fights, including losing the two most recent matches. All four fights occurred in less than a year, so he was much more rested.",

      "CARSON, Calif. -- Diego Fag\u00fandez scored a goal on Saturday night for LA and the short-handed Galaxy tied the Houston Dynamo 1-1.",
      "LA\u2019s Mathias J\u00f8rgensen, known as \u201cZanka\u201d, was shown a red card for denial of an obvious goal-scoring opportunity for Ponce in the 28th minute and the Galaxy played a man down the rest of the way.",
      "Christian Ram\u00edrez was fouled by Jos\u00e9 Artur de Lima J\u00fanior and Fag\u00fandez put away the ensuing free kick, tucking a shot under the crossbar and inside the right post from nearly-30 yards out to make it 1-1 in the 57th minute.",
      "Ezequiel Ponce opened the scoring in the 14th. Sebastian Kowalczyk, charging down the left side into the area, tapped a side-footer to Amine Bassi for a one-touch pass from the center of the box to Ponce, who re-directed it into the net from point-blank range to give Houston (1-4-3) a 1-0 lead.",
      "Blake Gillingham had a save for the Dynamo.",
      "LA (0-5-3) equaled its franchise worst start to a season, matching the 2003 team that went eight straight matches without a win to begin a campaign and is off to the third-worst start to a season in MLS history. Only the 2019 Colorado Rapids (two) and Toronto FC in 2012 (0) have collected fewer than three points from their first eight matches of a season in MLS history.",
      "John McCarthy had two saves for the Galaxy, who had 49% possession and were outshot 12-6.",
      "Fag\u00fandez, who turned 30 on Valentine's Day, started the match and became the youngest player in league history to reach 400 regular season appearances.",
      "The Galaxy commemorated the franchise's 30th season, and honored the 1996 team with players from the squad in attendance.",

      "Jaron Ennis crowned himself the best fighter in the 147-pound division when he stopped Eimantas Stanionis after six rounds and claimed three shares of the welterweight division with a decisive win in boxing\u2019s return to Atlantic City",
      "ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. -- Jaron Ennis crowned himself the best fighter in the 147-pound division when he stopped Eimantas Stanionis after six rounds and claimed three shares of the welterweight division crown with a decisive win Saturday night in boxing's return to Atlantic City.",
      "Ennis ran his record to 34-0 after the fight was waved off once Stanionis was unable to continue after the sixth round. Ennis sent Stanionis to the ropes and down to one knee with a series of left-handed uppercuts and body shots. Ennis stumbled Stanionis with a big blow to the body right before the bell \u2014 and the Philly fighter stared him down as he strutted to the corner.",
      "The seventh round never came.",
      "Ennis, out of northwest Philadelphia and a rising star in the sport, was already the IBF welterweight champion and he took the WBA and Ring Magazine away from Stanionis (15-1). Ennis said in the ring it was too early to decide if he would move up in weight class.",
      "There was a decided Philly flavor in Boardwalk Hall for Ennis' unification victory. \u201cBoots\u201d was accompanied to the ring by Philadelphia 76ers All-Star guard Tyrese Maxey \u2014 who draped the IBF belt over his right shoulder for the ring walk \u2014 and Philly rapper Meek Mill's music played between rounds.",
      "The 27-year-old Ennis has won eight straight fights overall and made four straight successful title defenses since he defeated Ukrainian fighter Karen Chukhadzhian for the championship in January 2023.",
      "The 30-year-old Stanionis, who represented Lithuania in the 2016 Olympic Games, was elevated to full WBA champion in August when Terence Crawford vacated the WBA belt.",
      "Boardwalk Hall hadn't held a major title fight since Sergey Kovalev beat Bernard Hopkins on Nov. 8, 2014, in a light heavyweight championship bout. Eleider Alvarez beat Kovalev and won the 175-pound championship by knockout at Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in 2018 in what can be generously described as the last big-time bout in Atlantic City.",
      "As Atlantic City casinos withered over the last dozen or so years, so did interest in hosting boxing cards.",
      "T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas and Madison Square Garden and Barclays Center in New York host some of the biggest domestic cards while the true headline bouts \u2014 topped by Tyson Fury\u2019s win over Francis Ngannou in October 2023 \u2014 are held in Saudi Arabia. Celebrity bouts such as Jake Paul\u2019s win over a 58-year-old Tyson have become the rage and can pack 70,000 fans inside a football stadium \u2014 though an expected sellout crowd of about 10,000 fans brought the building to life Saturday night.",
      "Ennis was raised in the Germantown section of Philadelphia and was a Golden Gloves gold medalist as an amateur. He made his pro debut in 2016. As for that Boots nickname? His dad was a boxer and Ennis picked it up as a kid when he tagged along to training sessions in the gym.",
      "Ennis headlined a card in July that attracted a surprising 14,119 fans in Philadelphia to the Wells Fargo Center and his next bout in November at the home of the Flyers and 76ers saw that number dip to about 10,000 fans at the fight.",
      "He's has been vocal about wanting to fight Errol Spence Jr. or Crawford in any weight class. He\u2019d also like a shot at Canelo Alvarez. Ennis also hasn\u2019t ruled out a move up in weight class to 154 pounds.",
      "With Maxey dancing with him in the ring, Ennis can settle for being the best at 147.",

      "ST. LOUIS -- Owen Michaels scored two third-period goals to seal Western Michigan\u2019s first Frozen Four championship in a 6-2 victory over Boston University on Saturday night.",
      "Iiro Hakkarainen and Wyatt Schingoethe had a goal and assist each, with Ty Henricks and Cole Crusberg-Roseen also scoring to cap the Broncos\u2019 first Frozen Four appearance in the program\u2019s 52-year history. Hampton Slukynsky stopped 24 shots and top-seeded Western Michigan (34-7-1) closed its winningest season with 10 straight victories.",
      "The Broncos reached the final with Michaels scoring his second goal 26 seconds into double-overtime in 3-2 victory over defending champion Denver in the semifinals Thursday night. The sophomore forward from Northville, Michigan, was voted the Frozen Four\u2019s outstanding player.",
      "In defeating the five-time champion Terriers, the Broncos become the fourth program to win the title in its championship game debut, joining Denver in 1958, Cornell (1967) and Lake Superior State (1988). Western Michigan also made it three-for-three for Michigan-based teams winning the tournament when played in St. Louis, after Michigan State won in 2007 and Michigan Tech in 1975.",
      "The win didn\u2019t come easily. The Terriers appeared to cut the lead to 4-3 with 8:04 remaining when Matt Copponi jammed in a rebound through Slukynsky\u2019s legs. Though replays clearly showed the puck going over the line, the goal was disallowed because the whistle had blown.",
      "Cole Eiserman and Shane Lachance scored for Boston University (24-14-2). Mikhail Yegorov stopped 22 shots in a matchup up freshman goalies.",
      "After Schingoethe and Eiserman traded goals in the first 7:12, the Broncos never trailed after Crusberg-Roseen scored with 4:59 left in the first period. Alex Bump was stopped on a 3-on-3 break, but BU\u2019s clearing attempt was intercepted by Crusberg-Roseen, who snapped a shot in through a crowd from the right circle.",
      "Trailing 3-2 to open the third period, Boston University had its best chance to tie it 3:30 into the frame during a scramble in front. Slukynsky stopped Cole Hutson\u2019s initial shot and then Tom Willander\u2019s chance. BU\u2019s Matt Copponi then slid the puck under the goalie only to have it stopped by defender Joona Vaisanen.",
      "A replay review showed the puck under Vaisanen\u2019s skate just outside the goal line.",
      "Michaels scored four minutes later to make it 4-2. Driving up the right wing on a 2-on-1 break Michaels slapped a shot inside the far post. His second goal came into an empty net.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has been predicting its barrage of tariffs targeting China will push Apple into manufacturing the iPhone in the U",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- President Donald Trump's administration has been predicting its barrage of tariffs targeting China will push Apple into manufacturing the iPhone in the United States for the first time.",
      "But that's an unlikely scenario even with U.S tariffs now standing at 145% on products made in China \u2014 the country where Apple has manufactured most of its iPhones since the first model hit the market 18 years ago.",
      "The disincentives for Apple shifting its production domestically include a complex supply chain that it began building in China during the 1990s. It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product.",
      "\u201cThe concept of making iPhones in the U.S. is a non-starter,\u201d asserted Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, reflecting a widely held view in the investment community that tracks Apple's every move. He estimated that the current $1,000 price tag for an iPhone made in China, or India, would soar to more than $3,000 if production shifted to the U.S. And he believes that moving production domestically likely couldn't be done until, at the earliest, 2028. \u201cPrice points would move so dramatically, it's hard to comprehend.\u201d",
      "Apple didn't respond to a request for comment Wednesday. The Cupertino, California, company has yet to publicly discuss its response to Trump\u2019s tariffs on China, but the topic may come up on May 1 when Apple CEO Tim Cook is scheduled to field questions from analysts during a quarterly conference call to discuss the company\u2019s financial results and strategy.",
      "And there is no doubt the China tariffs will be a hot-button issue given Apple\u2019s stock price has dropped by nearly 20% and lowered the company\u2019s market value by $600 billion since Trump began increasing them on April 2.",
      "If the tariffs hold, Apple is widely expected to eventually raise the prices on iPhones and other popular products because the Silicon Valley\u2019s supply chain is so heavily concentrated in China, India and other overseas markets caught in the crossfire of the escalating trade war.",
      "The big question is how long Apple might be willing to hold the line on its current prices before the tariffs\u2019 toll on the company\u2019s profit margins become too much to bear and consumers are asked to shoulder some of the burden.",
      "One of the main reasons that Apple has wiggle room to hold the line on its current iPhone pricing while the China tariffs remain in place is because the company continues to reap huge profit margins from the revenue generated by the subscriptions and other services tied to its product, said Forrester Research analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee. That division, which collected $96 billion in revenue during Apple\u2019s last fiscal year, remains untouched by Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "\u201cApple can absorb some of the tariff-induced cost increases without significant financial impact, at least in the short term,\u201d Chatterjee said.",
      "Apple tried to appease Trump in February by announcing plans to spend $500 billion and hire 20,000 people in the U.S. through 2028, but none of it was tied to making an iPhone domestically. Instead, Apple pledged to fund a Houston data center for computer servers powering artificial intelligence \u2014 a technology the company is expanding into as part of an industrywide craze.",
      "When asked this week about whether Trump believes Apple intends to build iPhones in the U.S., White House Press Secretary Karoline Levitt pointed to Apple's investment promise as evidence that the company thinks it could be done. \u201cIf Apple didn\u2019t think the United States could do it, they probably wouldn\u2019t have put up that big chunk of change,\u201d Leavitt said.",
      "U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also predicted tariffs would force a manufacturing shift during an April 6 appearance on a CBS news program. \u201cThe army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones, that kind of thing is going to come to America,\u201d Lutnick said.",
      "But during a 2017 appearance at a conference in China, Cook expressed doubt about whether the U.S. labor pool had enough workers with the vocational skills required to do the painstaking and tedious work that Lutnick was discussing.",
      "\u201cIn the U.S. you could have a meeting of tooling engineers and I\u2019m not sure we could fill the room,\u201d Cook said. \u201cIn China, you could fill multiple football fields.\u201d",
      "Trump also tried to pressure Apple, to no avail, into shifting iPhone production to the U.S. during his first term as president. But the administration ultimately exempted the iPhone from the tariffs he imposed on China back then \u2014 a period when Apple had announced a commitment to invest $350 billion in the U.S. Trump's first-term tariffs on China also prompted Apple to begin a process that led to some of its current iPhones being made in India and some of its other products being manufactured in Vietnam.",
      "Cook also took the president on a 2019 tour of a Texas plant where Apple had been assembling some of its Mac computers since 2013. Shortly after finishing that our, Trump took credit for the plant that Apple had opened while Barack Obama was president. \"Today I opened a major Apple Manufacturing plant in Texas that will bring high paying jobs back to America,\u201d Trump posted on Nov. 19, 2019.",

      "WASHINGTON -- See you later La Nina, we hardly knew you.",
      "La Nina, the natural cooling flip side of the better known and warmer El Nino climate phenomenon, has dwindled away after just three months. The La Nina that appeared in January, months later than forecast, was a weak one, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Thursday.",
      "Earth is now in a neutral setting in the El Nino Southern Oscillation cycle, which is generally the most benign of the three states that help influence hurricane formation, droughts, floods and global temperatures. NOAA forecasts the neutral setting to last most if not all of 2025. That makes longer-term weather forecasts a bit trickier because one of the major factors is not pushing one way or the other.",
      "La Nina is an irregular rising of unusually cold water in a key part of the central equatorial Pacific that changes weather patterns worldwide. It typically brings more Atlantic hurricanes in the summer, but it won't be a factor this year. In the United States, La Ninas tend to cause drier weather in the South and West and often make it wetter in parts of Indonesia, northern Australia and southern Africa.",
      "Studies have found that La Ninas tend to be costlier than El Ninos and neutral conditions.",
      "Before this three-month La Nina, the world had an unusually long three-year La Nina that ended in 2023.",

      "Beef has a grading system for fat and expected flavor, but being able to gauge the quality of tuna is new, according to Hideto Okada, who oversees AI at Fujitsu.",

Unlike the CT scan or X-ray, it doesn\u2019t use radiation, which can harm tissue.",
      "Chris Edwards, a medical doctor and professor at Queensland University of Technology, who trains sonographers, or health-care professionals who specialize in ultrasound, has studied how ultrasound can be used to see the fattiness of a human liver, linked to diabetes and other health problems.",

      "President Donald Trump offered some financial advice on Wednesday morning that ended up making a lot of money for any lucky investor who listened to him",
      "NEW YORK -- When Donald Trump offered some financial advice Wednesday morning, stocks were wavering between gains and losses.",
      "But that was about to change.",
      "\u201cTHIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT,\u201d he wrote on his social media platform Truth Social at 9:37 a.m.",
      "Less than four hours later, Trump announced a 90-day pause on nearly all his tariffs. Stocks soared on the news, closing up 9.5% by the end of trading. The market, measured by the S&P 500, gained back about $4 trillion, or 70%, of the value it had lost over the previous four trading days.",
      "It was a prescient call by the president. Maybe too prescient.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s loving this, this control over markets, but he better be careful,\u201d said Trump critic and former White House ethics lawyer, Richard Painter, noting that securities law prohibits trading on insider information or helping others do so. \u201cThe people who bought when they saw that post made a lot of money.\u201d",

      "Asked for clarification on the timing in an email to the White House later, a spokesperson didn't answer directly but defended Trump's post as part of his job.",
      "\u201cIt is the responsibility of the President of the United States to reassure the markets and Americans about their economic security in the face of nonstop media fearmongering,\" wrote White House spokesman Kush Desai.",

      "The ambiguity about what Trump meant didn't stop people from pouring money into that stock.",
      "Trump Media closed up 22.67%, soaring twice as much as the broader market, a stunning performance by a company that lost $400 million last year and is seemingly unaffected by whether tariffs would be imposed or paused.",
      "Trump\u2019s 53% ownership stake in the company, now in a trust controlled by his oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., rose by $415 million on the day.",

      "Microsoft says it's \u201cslowing or pausing\u201d some of data center construction, including a $1 billion project in Ohio",
      "Microsoft said it is \u201cslowing or pausing\u201d some of its data center construction, including a $1 billion project in Ohio, the latest sign that the demand for artificial intelligence technology that drove a massive infrastructure expansion might not need quite as many powerful computers as expected.",
      "The tech giant confirmed this week that it is halting early-stage projects on rural land it owns in central Ohio's Licking County, outside of Columbus, and will reserve two of the three sites for farmland.",
      "\u201cIn recent years, demand for our cloud and AI services grew more than we could have ever anticipated and to meet this opportunity, we began executing the largest and most ambitious infrastructure scaling project in our history,\u201d said Noelle Walsh, the president of Microsoft's cloud operations, in a post on LinkedIn.",
      "Walsh said \u201cany significant new endeavor at this size and scale requires agility and refinement as we learn and grow with our customers. What this means is that we are slowing or pausing some early-stage projects.\u201d",
      "Microsoft didn't say Wednesday what other projects it has slowed outside of Ohio, but in late December it revealed it was pausing the later phases of a large data center project in Wisconsin.",
      "Analysts with TD Cowen reported earlier this year that Microsoft was also scaling back some of its international data center expansion and canceling some leases in the U.S. for use of data centers operated by other companies.",
      "Other analysts for months have tied some of the changes to a shift in Microsoft's close relationship with its business partner OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT.",
      "\u201cOpenAI was moving in one direction\u201d by prioritizing the development of ever-more advanced AI systems, which require vast computing resources to train on troves of data, while \u201cMicrosoft may not have been moving that same direction,\u201d said Craig Ellis, director of research at B. Riley Securities.",
      "The two companies announced on Jan. 21 that they were altering the agreement that had made Microsoft the exclusive provider of OpenAI's computing power, enabling the smaller company to build its own capacity, \u201cprimarily for research and training of models.\u201d It was the same day that newly inaugurated President Donald Trump touted OpenAI's partnership with Oracle and SoftBank to pledge $500 billion in new AI infrastructure in the U.S., starting with a data center in Texas.",
      "Microsoft has long built data centers around the world to run its cloud computing services. The generative AI boom accelerated the demand for such facilities, both to train new AI systems and to keep them running as millions of people start using chatbots and other AI tools at work and home.",
      "The computing it takes to run AI tools is expensive and requires a large amount of electricity \u2014 so much so that Trump this week cited AI needs as part of the justification for using his emergency authorities to boost the U.S. coal industry, a reliable but polluting energy source. Tech companies have also sought to tap into nuclear power, including a proposed Microsoft-backed revival of the shuttered Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania, which would feed an electricity grid supplying data centers in Ohio as well as Virginia, the nation's biggest data center hub.",
      "Microsoft said it still plans to spend more than $80 billion globally to expand its AI infrastructure this fiscal year, which ends in June, and has already doubled its data center capacity over the past three years.",
      "\u201cWhile we may strategically pace our plans, we will continue to grow strongly and allocate investments that stay aligned with business priorities and customer demand,\u201d Walsh said.",
      "The Ohio pause nevertheless came as a disappointment to local officials.",
      "Licking County has also attracted data center investments from Microsoft rivals Google and Meta Platforms and a highly anticipated semiconductor factory from Intel, though the struggling chipmaker in February pushed back the expected completion date for the project's first stage to 2030.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Thanks to a mouse watching clips from \u201cThe Matrix,\u201d scientists have created the largest functional map of a brain to date \u2013 a diagram of the wiring connecting 84,000 neurons as they fire off messages.",
      "Using a piece of that mouse\u2019s brain about the size of a poppy seed, the researchers identified those neurons and traced how they communicated via branch-like fibers through a surprising 500 million junctions called synapses.",
      "The massive dataset, published Wednesday by the journal Nature, marks a step toward unraveling the mystery of how our brains work. The data, assembled in a 3D reconstruction colored to delineate different brain circuitry, is open to scientists worldwide for additional research \u2013 and for the simply curious to take a peek.",
      "\u201cIt definitely inspires a sense of awe, just like looking at pictures of the galaxies,\u201d said Forrest Collman of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle, one of the project\u2019s leading researchers. \u201cYou get a sense of how complicated you are. We\u2019re looking at one tiny part ... of a mouse\u2019s brain and the beauty and complexity that you can see in these actual neurons and the hundreds of millions of connections between them.\u201d",
      "How we think, feel, see, talk and move are due to neurons, or nerve cells, in the brain \u2013 how they\u2019re activated and send messages to each other. Scientists have long known those signals move from one neuron along fibers called axons and dendrites, using synapses to jump to the next neuron. But there\u2019s less known about the networks of neurons that perform certain tasks and how disruptions of that wiring could play a role in Alzheimer's, autism or other disorders.",
      "\u201cYou can make a thousand hypotheses about how brain cells might do their job but you can\u2019t test those hypotheses unless you know perhaps the most fundamental thing \u2013 how are those cells wired together,\u201d said Allen Institute scientist Clay Reid, who helped pioneer electron microscopy to study neural connections.",
      "With the new project, a global team of more than 150 researchers mapped neural connections that Collman compares to tangled pieces of spaghetti winding through part of the mouse brain responsible for vision.",
      "The first step: Show a mouse video snippets of sci-fi movies, sports, animation and nature.",
      "A team at Baylor College of Medicine did just that, using a mouse engineered with a gene that makes its neurons glow when they\u2019re active. The researchers used a laser-powered microscope to record how individual cells in the animal\u2019s visual cortex lit up as they processed the images flashing by.",
      "Next, scientists at the Allen Institute analyzed that small piece of brain tissue, using a special tool to shave it into more than 25,000 layers, each far thinner than a human hair. With electron microscopes, they took nearly 100 million high-resolution images of those sections, illuminating those spaghetti-like fibers and painstakingly reassembling the data in 3D.",
      "Finally, Princeton University scientists used artificial intelligence to trace all that wiring and \u201cpaint each of the individual wires a different color so that we can identify them individually,\u201d Collman explained.",
      "They estimated that microscopic wiring, if laid out, would measure more than 3 miles (5 kilometers). Importantly, matching up all that anatomy with the activity in the mouse's brain as it watched movies allowed researchers to trace how the circuitry worked.",
      "The Princeton researchers also created digital 3D copies of the data that other scientists can use in developing new studies.",
      "Could this kind of mapping help scientists eventually find treatments for brain diseases? The researchers call it a foundational step, like how the Human Genome Project that provided the first gene mapping eventually led to gene-based treatments. Mapping a full mouse brain is one next goal.",
      "\u201cThe technologies developed by this project will give us our first chance to really identify some kind of abnormal pattern of connectivity that gives rise to a disorder,\u201d another of the project's leading researchers, Princeton neuroscientist and computer scientist Sebastian Seung, said in a statement.",

      "The Assumption University students, all teenagers, were arraigned in January and entered not guilty pleas. Since then, their lawyers had filed motions seeking to dismiss the charges, saying authorities lacked probable cause to believe they committed crimes.",
      "Following a hearing last month, a Worcester District Court judge on Tuesday dismissed the conspiracy and kidnapping charges against Kelsy Brainard, Easton Randall, Kevin Carroll, Isabella Trudeau and Joaquin Smith. It wasn't immediately known if charges were still pending against a sixth student, whose case was being handled in juvenile court.",
      "\u201cIsabella is very happy the judge applied the law correctly,\u201d her lawyer, Robert Iacovelli, told WCVB-TV.",

      "Messages seeking comment were emailed Wednesday to the Worcester County District Attorney's office and to the university, where campus police had conducted an investigation.",
      "The Worcester Telegram & Gazette reported that defense lawyers entered into the court record a video of a university police officer interrogating one of the students as part of their argument to dismiss the charges. They said the officer presented an incomplete and distorted picture of the evidence.",
      "A report filed by campus police said a 22-year-old active-duty military service member connected with a woman on Tinder and was invited inside a basement lounge. Within minutes, \u201ca group of people came out of nowhere and started calling him a pedophile,\u201d accusing him of wanting sex with 17-year-old girls, according to the report.",
      "The man told police that he broke free and was chased by at least 25 people to his car, where he was punched in the head and his car door was slammed on him before he managed to flee.",
      "Campus surveillance video shows a large group of students, including the woman, \u201call with their cellphones out in what seems to be a recording of the whole episode,\u201d the police statement said. They are seen \u201claughing and high fiving with each other\u201d in what appeared to be \u201ca deliberately staged event,\u201d and there was no evidence to indicate the man was seeking sexual relations with girls, the police report said.",
      "Randall had told officers they were inspired by the \u201ccatch a predator\u201d trend, which he said \u201cis big on TikTok.\" He said their group shared ideas of what to tell the man through the Tinder app to lure him to campus, and then spread word through a dormitory chat group that a \u201cpredator\u201d was in the building, the report said.",
      "After the assault, Brainard reported the man to police as a sexual predator, police said, which they determined to be false.",

      "Lilt, an artificial intelligence company, began providing translations in late 2023, replacing manual translations that the weather service had said were labor-intensive and not sustainable and eventually. It eventually provided them in Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, French and Samoan. The contract lapse comes as President Donald Trump's administration is seeking to slash spending in federal agencies, including cuts within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that have led to high employee vacancy rates at NWS offices.",
      "NOAA referred questions about the contract to a message on its website announcing the contract had lapsed. Lilt did not respond to requests for comment.",

      "He said translated weather alerts saved lives during a deadly tornado outbreak in Kentucky in 2021. A Spanish-speaking family interviewed afterward said they got a tornado alert on their cellphone in English but ignored it because they didn't understand it, he said. When the same alert came in Spanish, they quickly sought shelter, he said.",

      "The translations are important for more than extreme weather events, said Andrew Kruczkiewicz, a senior researcher at the Columbia Climate School at Columbia University. General weather forecasts are essential for a number of sectors including tourism, transportation and energy. Families and businesses can make more informed decisions when they can get weather information that often includes actions that should be taken based on the forecast.",
      "Norma Mendoza-Denton, a professor of anthropology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said there are many people in the U.S. that function with limited English relevant to their daily routines. For example, a shopkeeper might be able to have short conversations with customers, but might not have the same understanding when it comes to reading weather or climate terminologies.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. House is rethinking its voting rules after a push from Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna to allow proxy voting for new parents",
      "WASHINGTON -- Anna Paulina Luna was at her Florida home in fall 2023, caring for her newborn son and turning over a question in her mind as a member of Congress:",
      "\u201cHow do I change this?\u201d",
      "Luna, then a first-time mom and first-term lawmaker, could no longer fly to Washington to cast votes in the U.S. House, a crucial part of the job, due to complications from childbirth \u2014 which she blamed at least partially on her hectic schedule, having flown to and from the capital during most of her pregnancy.",
      "Luna began reading House rules and found what seemed like a simple solution: allowing proxy voting for new moms.",
      "What Luna considered a minor rule change, affecting just a few \u2014 only about a dozen women had given birth while serving in Congress \u2014 over time escalated into a standoff against her own Republican leadership and her allies in the hard-right Freedom Caucus.",
      "In a matter of months, it became a highly charged debate that crossed party lines, united a younger generation of lawmakers and raised fresh questions about how a more than 200-year-old institution accommodates working parents in the 21st century. The conflict turned on weighty history and thorny procedures, highlighting the difficulties of abiding by documents and rules written long before air travel and Zoom screens \u2014 and long before women served in Congress.",
      "\u201cWhen the Constitution was written, this was not really a topic,\u201d Luna said.",
      "When Luna was about to become a new mom, planning for the big change ahead, she asked then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy how she would be able to vote in the days after giving birth. That was 2023, and she didn\u2019t realize she was stepping on a political landmine.",
      "At the start of the pandemic, more than two years before Luna was elected, Democrats in the majority had created a proxy voting system to contain COVID-19 and avoid overcrowding in the chamber.",
      "McCarthy had called the practice \u201c a dereliction of duty,\u201d an excuse for members to skip out on work, and the resolution creating the system passed without  a single Republican vote.",
      "When Republicans won the House majority in 2022, McCarthy abandoned proxy voting \u2014 and for a time, there was no talk of bringing it back.",
      "Once Luna was cleared to fly and returned to Washington, she kept the proxy voting proposal to herself. It wasn\u2019t the right time: The House was in turmoil, having just ousted McCarthy from the speaker\u2019s job and choosing Rep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana as his replacement.",
      "But a few months later, Luna made her move.",
      "She introduced a bill in January 2024 that would allow a mother to designate a proxy for six weeks, but by autumn, her legislation had gone nowhere, languishing in committee. Luna decided to launch a discharge petition \u2014 a workaround that allows legislation with 218 supporters to force a vote on the House floor. But she got just a handful of signatures.",
      "\u201cI went through every and exhausted every avenue,\u201d Luna said.",
      "Then she turned to Democrats, drafting a new proposal this year with Reps. Brittany Pettersen of Colorado and Sara Jacobs of California that would extend proxy voting to not just moms but all new parents for 12 weeks, double the time Luna had initially proposed.",
      "Pettersen, who was previously the first member of the Colorado legislature to give birth, said she \u201ccame to Congress wanting to work on this.\u201d",
      "In a matter of months, Republican Rep. Mike Lawler of New York, a father to two young girls, became the 218th member to sign the discharge petition, the tally needed to force a vote.",
      "But only a dozen signatures came from Republicans.",
      "Pushback was fierce, from members of the Freedom Caucus and from the speaker himself. Johnson repeatedly called proxy voting \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d Herself among the more far-right conservatives in the House, her desk adorned with a model of President Donald Trump on Mount Rushmore, Luna resigned from the Freedom Caucus, accusing them of working against her.",
      "Luna felt that she had done everything she could to address Johnson\u2019s concerns. She agreed that members had abused the practice in the past, but said her proposal included \u201cguard rails.\u201d",
      "Johnson tried to snuff out Luna\u2019s discharge petition with a rare legislative maneuver, linking it to a vote that was needed to advance one of the GOP priorities, a voter ID bill.",
      "The aggressive move angered several Republicans, including some who didn\u2019t even support Luna\u2019s proposal. Johnson's gambit failed on the floor.",
      "Johnson called the outcome \u201cunfortunate\u201d and reiterated the argument that proxy voting for moms was a \u201cPandora\u2019s box\u201d that would open the door for members who\u2019d rather not show up to work. Then he sent lawmakers home for the week.",
      "That\u2019s when Luna had a talk with Trump.",
      "\u201cI think she\u2019s great, Anna,\u201d Trump said aboard Air Force One.",
      "The president recalled that he had spoken to her the previous day. When it came to proxy voting, Trump wondered why the idea was \u201ccontroversial.\u201d",
      "Johnson sprang into action and quickly posted on social media that he had also spoken with Trump, quoting him saying, \u201cMike, you have my proxy on proxy voting.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, a political storm was brewing against Luna. Right-wing influencers flooded Twitter to accuse Luna of holding up Trump\u2019s agenda as House floor action stalled. She faced attacks from fellow Republicans.",
      "On a Sunday afternoon this month, Luna announced that she and leadership had reached an agreement.",
      "They would resurrect a well-worn congressional procedure that \u201cpairs\u201d two members of Congress who plan to vote on opposite sides of an issue, canceling out their votes \u2014 a way to accommodate the absent member.",
      "\u201cIf we truly want a pro-family Congress, these are the changes that need to happen,\u201d Luna posted on X.",
      "The plan was quickly tucked into an upcoming procedural vote. This time, it succeeded.",
      "Reviews were mixed.",
      "Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J., called the solution \u201cbizarre\u201d and said it was unlikely any member would voluntarily participate, essentially nulling their own vote, when the margins were so narrow in Congress.",
      "But GOP Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, a member of the Freedom Caucus who opposes all proxy voting, said he would consider participating in pairing.",
      "\u201cWe want to make it to where people can, you know, deal with whatever life curveballs they get,\u201d Roy said.",
      "Not everyone, though, is satisfied.",
      "The day that Congress voted on vote-pairing, Pettersen stood outside the House chamber, cradling her son in her arms. \u201cWhat Republican would be willing to vote present for me this week?\u201d she asked. \u201cNobody.\u201d",

      "Khalil is scheduled to appear before an immigration judge in Louisiana on Friday, a hearing that comes after the judge gave the government a deadline earlier this week to present evidence to back up several allegations made against Khalil, including that he misrepresented information on his green card application.",

      "The memo makes no mention of previous allegations that he misrepresented information on his green card application and instead doubles down on an obscure section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that deems migrants deportable \"if the Secretary of State has reasonable ground to believe that the alien's presence or activities in the United States would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\"",
      "The two-page memo also makes the case for why another person, whose name is redacted, should be deportable under the same arguments.",

      "Rubio \"talks about First Amendment activity in the United States and the effect on people in the U.S. His 'determination' has absolutely nothing to do with foreign policy.\"",
      "Van Der Hout also described as \"bogus\" the earlier allegations about alleged misrepresentations on Khalil's visa application and regarding negotiations he was involved in with Columbia over the student encampment.",
      "\"But it is zero to do with the foreign policy charge, and there is zero support for the government's allegations about any misrepresentation,\" Van Der Hout said. \"We're not concerned with that at all.\"",

      "The case could set the precedent that the government can silence its critics and remove them, in what can become \"a dangerous slope,\" Van Der Hout said.",
      "\"What the Rubio letter talks about is they're trying to protect -- they say -- Jewish people in the United States, from antisemitism. But what is the antisemitism? It is criticizing Israel and the United States for the slaughtering that is going on in Gaza and Palestine,\" Van Der Hout said.",
      "\"That's what this case is about, and that's what this case is really centered on, the rights of people in this country, citizens and immigrants alike -- who are all protected by the Constitution, by the First Amendment -- to be able to speak out whatever their views may be, popular or not,\" Van Der Hout said.",
      "Khalil's lawyers plan to request to depose Rubio in court to understand what grounds he had to make the determination that Khalil's presence in the US poses a risk to U.S. foreign policy interests.",
      "The immigration judge has said she will make a finding on whether Khalil is removable on Friday, according to Khalil's attorneys.",
      "\"But we are far from the end of the road if that happens,\" Johnny Sinodis, a lawyer and partner at Van Der Hout who is representing Khalil, said Thursday. If the immigration judge determines that Khalil is, in fact, removable, the case will move into a next phase but Khalil can still litigate his right to remain in the U.S.",
      "\"This process plays out in immigration court, and it will most certainly require several more hearings before a final decision can be made in the immigration case,\" Sinodis said.",

    "summary": "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said at Thursday\u2019s Cabinet meeting that, by September, his agency will \"know what has caused the autism epidemic.\"",
    "story": [
      "Kennedy said he believes as many as 1 in 31 children have autism.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made a significant commitment at Thursday's Cabinet meeting at the White House, saying that his agency will \"know what has caused the autism epidemic\" by September.",
      "Kennedy said that HHS had launched, at President Donald Trump's direction, a large research effort involving \"hundreds of scientists from around the world\" to look into the rising rates of autism diagnoses.",
      "\"At your direction, we are going to know by September,\" Kennedy said. \"We've launched a massive testing and research effort that's going to involve hundreds of scientists from around the world.\"",
      "\"In September, we will know what has caused the autism epidemic and we'll be able to eliminate those exposures,\" he added.",
      "Trump commended Kennedy on the September goal, speculating -- without scientific backing -- that the answer to driving down rates could be \"you stop taking something, you stop eating something or maybe it's a shot, but something's causing it.\"",
      "Kennedy and Trump have both made it a priority to understand what's causing the rise in autism rates in the U.S.",
      "Scientists have been studying the cause of autism for decades, and have identified genetics and several other factors as possibly playing a role.",
      "It is true that estimated autism rates have climbed in the past 20 years, however experts say these rising rates are likely largely due to better awareness, a wide definition of autism spectrum disorder, and better access to services, leading to more children being screened and diagnosed. It's possible that a yet-unknown factor is also contributing to the increase.",
      "In 2000, approximately 1 in 150 children in the U.S. born in 1992 were diagnosed with autism. By 2020, 1 in 36 children born in 2012 were diagnosed, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "At the Cabinet meeting, Kennedy said that he believes those rates have risen, per new data to be released, to 1 in 31 children.",
      "In a later interview on Fox News' \"The Story with Martha MacCallum,\" Kennedy said the National Institutes of Health would oversee the study and that it would look into \"everything.\"",
      "\"We\u2019re going to look at everything. Everything is on the table -- our food system, our water, our air, we will find out what\u2019s triggering this epidemic,\" Kennedy said. \"We know it is an environmental toxin that is causing this cataclysm. Through research at NIH, we will find an answer to this question.\"",
      "In his confirmation hearing, NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya said he \"fully\" supported childhood vaccination and didn't \"generally believe\" there was a link between vaccines and autism. But he said finding answers on the rise in autism cases generally was a vital public health goal.",
      "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, chairman of the Senate health committee, encouraged Bhattacharya to look into autism rates, but strongly dissuaded him and Kennedy from \"plow[ing] the barren ground\" of investigating vaccines and autism, because it had already been debunked \"multiple times.\"",
      "\"If we\u2019re pissing away money over here, that\u2019s less money that we have to actually go after the true reason,\" Cassidy, a doctor, told Bhattacharya during his hearing.But Kennedy has also brought on a well-known vaccine skeptic, David Geier, to study the connection between vaccines and autism, the Washington Post and New York Times have reported.",
      "The concern, experts say, is that while investing more into research could provide answers, Kennedy has also frequently raised the question of MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccines as a link, despite dozens of studies debunking the claim.",
      "The elevated platform for vaccine hesitancy poses a particular risk as hundreds of measles cases are spreading across western Texas, largely in unvaccinated communities, and two unvaccinated school-aged children have died.",
      "Despite Kennedy's efforts to investigate vaccines and autism, he said in an interview with CBS News on Wednesday that he encouraged vaccination, a notably supportive departure from some of Kennedy's past comments.\"The government's position, my position, is that people should get the measles vaccine,\" he said, though added that it shouldn't be mandated.",

    "story": [
      "The president told social media followers, \"THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY.\"",
      "Two Democratic senators are demanding answers from the White House over serious concerns that President Donald Trump's rollbacks on his tariffs and his social media posts earlier Wednesday may have been part of insider trading among White House allies.",
      "Sens. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., sent a letter to Trump's chief of staff, Susie Wiles, and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on Thursday asking for an investigation into potential conflicts of interest over the actions that took place Wednesday.",
      "Hours before Trump announced he was rolling back tariffs to 10% to all countries except China, which sent the stock market soaring, he posted on Truth Social: \"BE COOL! Everything is going to work out well. The USA will be bigger and better than ever before!\" and \"THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT.\"",
      "\"This sequence of events raises grave legal and ethics concerns. The President, his family, and his advisors are uniquely positioned to be privy to and take advantage of non-public information to inform their investment decisions,\" the senators said in their letter.",
      "Stocks were down Wednesday morning before Trump's Truth Social post immediately caused markets to spike. Nasdaq soared 12.1% at close, the index's largest single-day gain since 2021, while the Dow jumped 7.8%, its biggest one-day increase in five years.",
      "The White House has not immediately commented.",
      "The senators asked the Office of Government Ethics to probe whether any White House or executive branch officials, to include special government employees, were informed of the announcement in advance and what financial transactions were made by officials with knowledge of nonpublic information.",
      "The senators also said they wanted answers to several questions about Wednesday's chain of events, including whether any Trump's family members were informed of the deliberations prior to Trump's Truth Social post announcing the tariff changes and if there were any records of communications with executive branch officials, family members or special government employees.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Wednesday that the president's decision was part of his plan and that 75 countries had called to negotiate with the president. They did not provide further details.",
      "Hours later, however, Trump told reporters he made his decision Wednesday morning.",
      "\"I think it probably came together early this morning, fairly early this morning. Just wrote it up. I didn't -- we didn't have the use of, we didn't have access to lawyers, or it was just brought up. We wrote it up from our hearts,\" he said.",
      "Michael Guttentag, a Loyola Law School professor who has written several research papers on insider trading, told ABC News there is no universal national insider trading law. Rather, cases have been prosecuted, generally, through court decisions that have set precedents.",
      "\"Generally, the other issue is the standard test for insider trading is, 'Did you have material nonpublic information?,'\" he told ABC News.",
      "However, in 2012, Congress passed the Stock Act of 2012, which made it illegal for Congress members and anyone part of the executive branch to take part in insider trading.",
      "Guttentag said it would not be hard to determine if insider trading took place within the White House as one would just need to start by pulling up the trading records, match them with individuals linked to the executive office and the time Trump's announcement was made.",
      "He noted former U.S. Rep. Chris Collins was prosecuted on insider trading in 2018 after the Office of Congressional Ethics determined he used his congressional connections to inform his son to sell stocks of a pharmaceutical company that was about to get information on a drug trial. Investigators were able to determine Collins made the call to his son while at a picnic at the White House almost immediately after he received the e-mail about the failed drug trial.",
      "He ultimately resigned from his seat and pleaded guilty to insider trading in 2019 but was pardoned by Trump in December 2020.",
      "Guttentag said the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission would be in charge of investigating the civil and criminal allegations of potential violations of the 2012 Stock Act.",
      "While Trump and other officials declined to talk more about Schiff and Gallego's request, some other Democratic senators at the Capitol on Thursday also questioned the timing of the announcement and the rise in stocks.",
      "\"Look, it shouldn't be an investigation by Democrats or Republicans, it should be an independent investigation. And if the president and his cabinet and his family have nothing to hide, they should want an investigation like that. Let's just clear up the smoke here,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., told reporters.",
      "\"Over and over again we see evidence of self-dealing and efforts to improve your bottom-line net worth with the policies of this administration,\" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said. \"I think it deserves closer scrutiny.\"",
      "But some Republicans dismissed the concern.",
      "Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, called the assertion of insider trading \"ridiculous\" and said Democrats were just looking to \"take a dig\" at Trump.",
      "\"It's pretty obvious that when the stock market is in a dip that maybe if you have some money, you might consider investing and make some money when it picks back up again. I think any idea of insider trading is ridiculous,\" Cornyn told reporters.",
      "Guttentag noted investigating possible insider trading within the executive branch and prosecuting them if there any solid evidence is a long hill to climb. However, he said it is imperative that ethics rules are followed.",
      "\"People tend to find insider trading reprehensible. If [investigators] could share evidence that people were trading in this window, it would be important in establishing transparency and keeping the rule of law,\" he said.",

      "Ackman speaks out after getting an earful from small businesses.",
      "Hedge fund honcho Bill Ackman joined a growing list of President Donald Trump's billionaire backers calling for the White House to slam the brakes on tariffs just hours before Trump authorized a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for most countries that went into effect Wednesday morning.",
      "Ackman took to social media early Wednesday, asking Trump to put a 90-day pause on tariffs, arguing the president can \"accomplish his objectives without destroying small businesses in the short term.\"",
      "In a lengthy post on X, Ackman, founder of Pershing Square Capital Management, issued a dire warning of what could happen if the tariffs weren't halted immediately.",
      "\"If the president doesn't pause the effect of the tariffs soon, many small businesses will go bankrupt,\" Ackman wrote. \"Medium-sized businesses will be next.\"",
      "Ackman joined other billionaires, including some like him who supported Trump's campaign for reelection, in turning a cold shoulder to the escalating tariff war. Trump claims the tariffs are necessary for leveling the playing field for the United States importers, saying, \"foreign trade and economic practices have created a national emergency.\"",
      "It was not immediately clear if the pushback from his billionaire supporters prompted Trump to hit pause.",
      "Other billionaire moguls -- including investor and philanthropist Stanley Druckenmiller, Citdel owner Kenneth Griffin and even Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a senior adviser to the president -- have spoken out against Trump's tariffs after supporting the president's re-election campaign.",
      "Speaking at an event in Miami on Monday night, Griffin called Trump's tariffs a \"huge policy mistake,\" according to The Wall Street Journal. In a rare social media post on Sunday, Druckenmiller wrote, \"I do not support tariffs exceeding 10%.\"",
      "Musk has publicly blasted Trump's senior trade adviser Peter Navarro, one of the architects of Trump's tariff policy, calling him \"truly a moron\" and \"dumber than a sack of bricks\" after Navarro described him as a \"car assembler.\" In a live stream speech to Italy's League Congress Conference in Florence, Italy, on Saturday, Musk expressed hope for the U.S. and Europe to create \"a very close, stronger partnership\" and reach a \"zero-tariff\" policy soon.",
      "A 10% tariff on all U.S. trading partners went into effect on Saturday. Additional reciprocal tariffs against more than 60 countries that place duties on U.S. imports went into effect at 12:01 a.m. ET on Wednesday. But on Wednesday afternoon, Trump was pausing the reciprocal tariffs on most countries about 13 hours after they went into effect and eight days after he announced them in a White House news conference.",
      "The pause would not apply to China, however, because government officials there were unwilling to make a deal, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.",
      "Trump had already raised tariffs on China to 104% after China refused to back down from imposing a 34% tariff on U.S. goods. On Wednesday, China responded by jacking up tariffs on U.S. products to 84%, prompting Trump to tack on an additional 21%, bringing China's tariff to 125%.",
      "European Union countries on Wednesday backed the European Commission\u2019s proposal to push back on Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminum with a set of countermeasures.",
      "Ackman spoke out against tariffs, saying he is \"receiving an increasing number of emails and texts from small business people I do business or have invested in, expressing fear that they will not be able to pass on their increased costs to their customers and will suffer severely negative consequences.\"",
      "In his post Wednesday, Ackman shared an email from the founder of a cold brew coffee business he said he received before China's announced retaliatory tariffs. The cold brew coffee founder said his cost for glass bottles sourced from China will go up 50%, while chai sourced from India will increase by 26% and coffee imported from Ethiopia, Peru and Canada will climb by 10%.",
      "\"Will my clients tolerate a near doubling of their contract costs overnight, or will they expect me to absorb the increases my vendors are already threatening?\" the business owner wrote in the email to Ackman. \"If clients resist price hikes and my employees demand higher wages to offset their rising cost of living, we end up in a lose-lose scenario -- no spending and no jobs.\"",
      "Ackman ended his post by writing, \"May cooler heads prevail.\"",
      "Following Trump's announcement that he was pausing tariffs on most countries, Ackman issued a series of new posts on X, including one saying, \"This was brilliantly executed by @realDonald Trump. Texbook, Art of the Deal.\"",
      "\"The benefit of @realDonaldTrump\u2019s approach is that we now understand who are our preferred trading partners, and who the problems are. China has shown themselves to be a bad actor,\" Ackman said in a post. \"Our counterparties also have a taste of what life is like if they don\u2019t take down their trade barriers.\"",
      "Ackman added, \"This is the perfect setup for trade negotiations over the next 90 days\" and he offered a piece of advice for China: \"Pick up the phone and call the President. He is a tough but fair negotiator. The longer China holds out and retaliates, the worse the outcome for China.\"",

      "\"It is with great regret that I must inform you that your position is being abolished and you have been reached for reduction in force (RIF) action,\" the notices read, in part.",
      "The RIF was one of the first major steps in massively reducing the Education Department after President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing Secretary of Education Linda McMahon to close the agency on March 20.",
      "Both Trump and McMahon have suggested they will continue reducing the size of the agency and return education power and decisions to the states.",
      "The president has said that the RIF'd employees either weren't showing up to work or they weren't good at their jobs. But the notices explained that the separation is not based on performance evaluations -- it is due to the \"reduction in the number of positions\" at the agency. The notices also said that employees have the right to appeal this reduction.",

      "\"What they're doing is illegal,\" Willoughby told ABC News. \"They know it's illegal. It creates damage to people. They're damaging not only what they say is the deep state \u2014 really dedicated federal workers who are working professionally on behalf of education families and young people but they're also damaging these families and these kids in these communities, many of them who voted for this administration and the constituents of these senators and representatives, who are saying nothing about it.\"",
      "The letter sent on Thursday is a required 60-day notice alerting federal employees of their final days, according to a source familiar with the matter. Until those 60 days are up, the affected employees are on paid administrative leave. On June 10, they will no longer be employed.",
      "\"ED appreciates the service you have rendered,\" the notice said, adding, \"We deeply regret that this decision affects you, and we recognize the difficulty of the moment.\"",
      "Last month the department announced that about half of its 4,000-plus employees were eliminated either through its reduction, voluntary separations or retirements. Dozens more probationary employees were let go -- and then rehired after a court order overturned the administration's terminations.",
      "Chief Human Capital Officer Jacqueline Clay sent the official email, with the subject line of Notice of Separation Due To Reduction In Force, between 3 and 4 p.m. ET along with associated documents, including information on employee benefits and severance pay.",

      "After years of a shortened crab fishing season aimed at preventing whale entanglements off the West Coast, California crabbers are experimenting with a new fishing method that allows them to stay on the water longer while keeping the marine mammals safe",
      "After years of a shortened crab fishing season aimed at preventing whale entanglements off the West Coast, California crabbers are experimenting with a new fishing method that allows them to stay on the water longer while keeping the marine mammals safe.",
      "The state has been running a pilot program since 2023 to try out so-called pop-up gear to protect whales while finding a solution to fishermen's woes and is expected to fully authorize the gear for spring Dungeness crab fishing in 2026.",
      "The gear, which uses a remote device to pull up lines laid horizontally across the sea floor, also is being tried on lobster in Maine, black sea bass in Georgia and fisheries in Australia and Canada.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, it has been six years we've been delayed or closed early for whales,\u201d said Brand Little, a San Francisco Dungeness crab fisherman who is among those participating in the pilot.",
      "\"This is a way to get our industry back,\" he said.",
      "The effort comes after reports of whale entanglements off the Pacific Coast spiked a decade ago during a marine heat wave. The change in temperature drove whales, many of them threatened or endangered humpbacks, to seek out food sources closer to the California coast, where they were caught in vertical fishing lines that had been strung between crab pots on the ocean floor and buoys bobbing on the surface.",
      "In response, California state regulators barred Dungeness crab fishing when whales are known to be present. That shortened the season significantly, giving fishermen a narrow window in which to make a living. So some began trying pop-up gear and determined the method works and is worth the additional cost.",
      "The gear lets fishermen use a remote-operated, acoustic release device to pop-up a crab pot from the ocean floor rather than have it tethered to a floating buoy. Pots can be strung together with ropes laid horizontally instead of vertically, so whales can pass over them while migrating through the area.",
      "\u201cIf you remove the vertical line, you have removed the entanglement risk, and you have allowed a fishery to continue,\u201d said Ryan Bartling, senior environmental scientist supervisor with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.",
      "Many long-time Dungeness crab fishermen have been slow to warm up to the idea due to the cost, which can run $1,000 per pop-up device plus an on-board unit. It also takes time to restring the pots after an intense winter season of derby-style fishing, which takes place when whales are calving in warmer waters to the south.",
      "There also is a need for a unified tracking system since the gear isn\u2019t visible on the surface, Bartling said.",
      "More than four dozen whales were entangled in fishing nets in 2015, compared with an annual average of 10 in prior years, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "Many were humpback whales, which were listed as endangered in the 1970s and have been recovering since protections were put in place, the agency said.",
      "Environmental advocates sued California over the increased entanglements and reached a settlement with the state in 2019 that encouraged the use of ropeless gear.",
      "Bart Chadwick, who owns San Diego-based Sub Sea Sonics, said he previously used pop-up technology to retrieve expensive equipment while conducting environmental work at sea. When he retired from his job, he made tweaks so it could be adapted for fishing.",
      "\u201cIt allows them to fish in places they wouldn\u2019t otherwise,\u201d Chadwick said, adding the technology also reduces gear losses.",
      "Most Dungeness crab fishermen make their money during the early part of the season when whales typically aren't near the California coast. Experts say the pop-up gear won't work then due to crowding and the technology is currently being considered solely for the smaller spring season, which starts April 16 in central California.",
      "Geoff Shester, senior scientist at conservation organization Oceana, said he thinks the method could eventually be used more broadly if fishermen find it efficient and cost-effective.",
      "\u201cThink about electric cars, or hybrids, or even digital cameras,\" Shester said. \"Every time you have a new technology, there is a lot of resistance at first.\u201d",
      "Crab fisherman Ben Platt said he was a vocal opponent but will join this year's pilot since multiple pots now can be strung together, making the method simpler and cheaper. Still, he said many fishermen have concerns and aren't likely to get on board.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to see and take a look at the results,\u201d Platt said.",
      "For Stephen Melz, who fishes out of Half Moon Bay, California, having more time out on the ocean is key. Years ago, he said he would go out for Dungeness crab starting in November and fish through the spring.",
      "Now, with the shortened season, he said there is no room for error and the gear helps him get out so he can pay his bills.",
      "\u201cBetter than just sitting at dock,\u201d he said.",

      "MIAMI -- President Donald Trump entered to a standing ovation and cheers from a crowd of thousands attending a UFC event on Saturday night, shaking hands with supporters against a backdrop of fans waving his trademark MAGA hats.",
      "Just as Trump entered, he greeted podcast host Joe Rogan, who sat to the right of the president. On the other side of Trump sat Elon Musk, billionaire and chief of the Department of Government Efficiency. Trump, who accented his dark suit with a bright yellow tie, pumped his fist in the air, prompting cheers to strains of \u201cTaking Care of Business.\u201d",
      "He brought along several members of his administration and White House team, including Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., FBI Director Kash Patel, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and White House communications aides Steven Cheung and Taylor Budowich. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, also joined Trump for UFC 314.",
      "Trump entered the arena with UFC President Dana White, with whom he has been close for decades. He was also accompanied by his granddaughter, Kai Trump, the daughter of Donald Trump Jr.",
      "The Republican president is a longtime UFC fan and sports enthusiast, who has frequently attended major fights. The mixed martial arts fight at Miami\u2019s Kaseya Center was Trump's first UFC visit since he took office in January, and it came weeks after Trump attended the Saudi-sponsored LIV golf tournament at his golf club in Miami.",
      "In a further nod to his sports enthusiasm, Trump has also attended the Super Bowl and Daytona 500 since taking office. He sat cageside at a UFC championship fight in New York City last November, shortly after he won the 2024 election.",
      "Aside from the president, the main event for the UFC 314 fight is a championship bout between Australian former champion Alexander Volkanovski and Brazilian fighter Diego Lopes, who are competing for the featherweight championship title. It's the fourth UFC event in Miami, in a county that supported the president by about 11 percentage points in the November election.",
      "The president arrived in West Palm Beach on Friday for his 10th visit to South Florida since he became president, spending the evening in his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach. He flew to Miami after playing golf at his club in West Palm Beach.",
      "\u201cYou know who\u2019s going to win? Dana White. Dana White\u2019s gonna win,\u201d Trump told reporters Saturday night aboard Air Force One.",
      "His close affiliation with UFC helped boost his 2024 presidential campaign among young male voters prior to the November election, where he made promoting hypermasculine tones a signature of the campaign.",

      "The Trump administration has confirmed to a federal judge that a Maryland man who was mistakenly deported last month remained confined in a notorious prison in El Salvador",
      "The Trump administration confirmed to a federal judge Saturday that a Maryland man who was mistakenly deported last month remains confined in a notorious prison in El Salvador.",
      "But the government's filing did not address the judge's demands that the administration detail what steps it was taking to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the United States. The government said only that Abrego Garcia, 29, is under the authority of the El Salvador government.",
      "Abrego Garcia's location was confirmed to the court by Michael G. Kozak, who identified himself in the filing as a \u201cSenior Bureau Official\u201d in the State Department's Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs.",
      "The filing comes one day after a U.S. government attorney struggled in a hearing to provide U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis with any information about Abrego Garcia\u2019s whereabouts. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the Trump administration must bring him back.",
      "Xinis issued an order Friday requiring the administration to disclose Abrego Garcia's \u201ccurrent physical location and custodial status\u201d and \u201cwhat steps, if any, Defendants have taken (and) will take, and when, to facilitate\u201d his return.",
      "\u201cIt is my understanding based on official reporting from our Embassy in San Salvador that Abrego Garcia is currently being held in the Terrorism Confinement Center in El Salvador,\u201d Kozak\u2019s statement said. \u201cHe is alive and secure in that facility. He is detained pursuant to the sovereign, domestic authority of El Salvador.\u201d",
      "Kozak's statement did not address the judge's latter requirements.",
      "Xinis was exasperated Friday with the government's lack of information.",
      "\u201cWhere is he and under whose authority?\u201d the judge asked during the hearing. \u201cI\u2019m not asking for state secrets. All I know is that he\u2019s not here. The government was prohibited from sending him to El Salvador, and now I\u2019m asking a very simple question: Where is he?\u201d",
      "The judge repeatedly asked a government attorney about what has been done to return Abrego Garcia, asking pointedly: \u201cHave they done anything?\u201d",
      "Drew Ensign, a deputy assistant attorney general, told Xinis that he had no personal knowledge about any actions or plans to return Abrego Garcia. But he told the judge the government was \u201cactively considering what could be done\u201d and said that Abrego Garcia\u2019s case involved three Cabinet agencies and significant coordination.",
      "Before the hearing ended, Xinis ordered the U.S. to provide daily status updates on plans to return Abrego Garcia.",
      "The Justice Department did not immediately respond Saturday evening to an Associated Press request for comment.",
      "Abrego Garcia has lived in the U.S. for roughly 14 years, during which he worked construction, got married and was raising three children with disabilities, according to court records.",
      "If he is returned, he will get to face the allegations that prompted his expulsion: a 2019 accusation from local police in Maryland that he was an MS-13 gang member.",
      "Abrego Garcia denied the allegation and was never charged with a crime, his attorneys said. A U.S. immigration judge subsequently shielded him from deportation to El Salvador because he likely faced persecution there by local gangs that terrorized his family.",
      "The Trump administration deported him there last month anyway, later describing the mistake as \u201can administrative error\u201d but insisting he was in MS-13.",

      "FRANKFORT, Ky. -- Signs of renewal are underway at the Buffalo Trace Distillery in Kentucky since floodwaters that inundated the whiskey-making campus receded. But executives say the painstaking task of inspecting any bourbon barrels touched by the high water will take time.",
      "The historic distillery has resumed shipping spirits and hopes to reopen its bottling operation in the coming days, Jake Wenz, CEO and president of the Sazerac Co. and the distillery, said Friday. The campus could reopen to visitors soon on a limited basis but for now is closed to guests through Sunday.",
      "\u201cRestoration of this National Historic Landmark is our top priority to ensure a quick return to making quality, award-winning whiskey and welcoming guests from around the world,\" Wenz said in a release.",
      "The Frankfort, Kentucky-based distillery \u2014 which produces some of the most sought-after bourbon brands \u2014 was inundated by floodwaters from the nearby Kentucky River after days of downpours overfilled rivers to near-record levels across parts of the Bluegrass State.",
      "Now that the murky floodwaters are gone, the cleanup at Buffalo Trace is progressing. Teams of engineers and restoration experts have been assessing damage in the buildings that were flooded.",
      "The overall amount of damage is still being determined, the distillery said.",
      "Those damage assessments include some of the barrels filled with aging whiskey. Bourbon gets its flavor and golden brown color during aging. Workers were able to move some barrels of bourbon to upper floors of storage warehouses before the prolonged rains produced the flooding.",
      "Inspections of any barrels touched by the flood began Thursday and will continue until each is carefully assessed, a process that could take several weeks to complete, the distillery said. It hasn\u2019t said how many barrels were affected but said it doesn\u2019t expect any meaningful loss of inventory.",
      "\"This is a very involved process, including both barrel inspection as well as a rigorous quality testing that we do with all of our products,\u201d said Harlen Wheatley, master distiller at Buffalo Trace.",
      "Based on its experience from previous floods, the distillery is \u201cconfident in our process\u201d and that it successfully recovered the barrels affected by the flood, Wheatley said. The distillery has markers of several high-water marks from previous floods inside its buildings.",
      "\u201cA lot of heart and soul goes into every product we make, which is why our team is dedicated to testing with heavy scrutiny each barrel possibly affected by floodwaters to ensure there are no issues,\u201d he said.",
      "Crews started cleaning up the distillery's visitor center, where the flood reached the first floor. During repairs, the distillery said it plans to reopen a modified version of its visitor center as soon as possible.",
      "As a first step, the distillery plans to operate a modified retail hub from its visitor check-in center. Access will be via an email reservation system offered first to people who had tours interrupted by the flooding.",
      "Buffalo Trace Distillery is owned by Sazerac and its popular bourbons include the Buffalo Trace, Eagle Rare and W.L. Weller brands.",

      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- A Kansas man who was falsely accused of being among the shooters who opened fire at a rally celebrating the Kansas City Chiefs\u2019 Super Bowl victory last year has died, his attorney said.",
      "Denton Loudermill Jr., of Olathe, was briefly handcuffed but was never charged in the chaos that followed the deadly shooting. He later filed lawsuits against three Republican Missouri state senators and a Tennessee congressman who shared social media posts that falsely implicated him.",
      "Those cases were all dismissed, largely on jurisdictional issues.",
      "Attorney LaRonna Lassiter Saunders confirmed Loudermill\u2019s death in a statement Friday but gave no details on the circumstances. Loudermill was 49.",
      "\u201cMore details will be provided in time, but for now, we ask that you honor the family\u2019s need for privacy as they come together to grieve this tremendous loss,\u201d she wrote.",
      "The Feb. 14, 2024, shooting outside Union Station in Kansas City, Missouri, killed a well-known DJ and injured more than 20 others, many of them children.",
      "Loudermill\u2019s lawsuits said he froze when the gunfire erupted, standing in the middle of the chaos so long that police had put up crime scene tape by the time he finally started to walked away. As he tried to leave, officers stopped him and told him he was moving \u201ctoo slow.\u201d They handcuffed him and put him on a curb, where people began taking pictures and posting them on social media, the lawsuits said.",
      "Loudermill ultimately was led away and told he was free to go. But soon posts began appearing on X that included a picture of Loudermill, a car wash employee who was born and raised in the U.S. The posts called him an \u201cillegal alien\u201d and a \u201cshooter,\u201d even though he had no involvement, the lawsuits said.",
      "Three men were ultimately charged with murder, and several other people faced other charges stemming from the shootings, which authorities said stemmed from a dispute between two groups of people.",
      "Lassiter Saunders said she would continue fighting to clear Loudermill's name.",
      "\u201cWhile the family takes this time to mourn, we want to make it clear that this is not over. Mr. Loudermill should not have spent his final days burdened with stress and chasing down a lie that went viral due to the careless and heartless actions of a Congressman, Missouri senators, and social media influencers, who couldn\u2019t be bothered to verify the truth before destroying a man\u2019s life.",

      "The lawyers raised the subject as they submitted a proposed questionnaire to be filled out by individuals summoned for his May 5 trial in Manhattan federal court.",
      "In a letter to a judge late Friday, the lawyers said they want to know the willingness of would-be jurors to watch videos that are sexually explicit or show physical assault. They also say they want to know their views toward people with multiple sexual partners.",
      "Prosecutors in a letter of their own criticized the defense's proposed questionnaire as too long and touching on subjects that would be better asked in person by the judge, if at all.",
      "They said some of the defense's proposed 72 questions, some containing subparts, were \u201cutterly irrelevant to the ability to serve on a jury.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors also cited the sex trafficking trial of Ghislaine Maxwell as an example of how a lengthy questionnaire can be damaging.",
      "After Maxwell was convicted of sex trafficking in December 2021, a juror admitted that he had failed to disclose that he was a sex abuse victim, blaming his oversight in part on being \u201cdistracted as he filled out the questionnaire\" and having \u201cskimmed way too fast,\u201d causing him to misunderstand questions.",
      "Judge Arun Subramanian has told lawyers that questionnaires will be distributed to hundreds of prospective jurors at the end of April so that questioning of prospective jurors can begin on May 5, with opening statements likely on May 12.",
      "Combs, 55, has pleaded not guilty to allegations that he subjected individuals to sexual abuse over a two-decade period. The Bad Boy Records founder has remained incarcerated without bail since his September arrest.",
      "An indictment accuses Combs of using the \u201cpower and prestige\u201d he wielded as a music mogul to intimidate, threaten and lure women into his orbit, often under the pretense of a romantic relationship.",
      "The indictment said he then used force, threats and coercion to cause victims, including three women specified in the court papers, to engage in commercial sex acts.",
      "It said he subjected his victims to violence, threats of violence, threats of financial and reputational harm and verbal abuse.",
      "Prosecutors have said that a key piece of the evidence at trial will be a video showing Combs punching his former protege and girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie, and throwing her on the floor in a hotel hallway.",
      "Defense lawyers have argued that prosecutors built their case on charges that try to demonize sex acts between consenting adults.",
      "They told the judge they were unable to reach a consensus with prosecutors for what prospective jurors should be asked on questionnaires.",

      "U.S. importers are bracing for the impact of President Donald Trump's staggering 145% levy on Chinese imports",
      "WASHINGTON -- Rick Woldenberg thought he had come up with a sure-fire plan to protect his Chicago-area educational toy company from President Donald Trump\u2019s massive new taxes on Chinese imports.",
      "\"When he announced a 20% tariff, I made a plan to survive 40%, and I thought I was being very clever,\" said Woldenberg, CEO of Learning Resources, a third-generation family business that has been manufacturing in China for four decades. \"I had worked out that for a very modest price increase, we could withstand 40% tariffs, which was an unthinkable increase in costs.\"",
      "His worst-case scenario wasn\u2019t worst-case enough. Not even close.",
      "The American president quickly upped the ante with China, raising the levy to 54% to offset what he said were China\u2019s unfair trade practices. Then, enraged when China retaliated with tariffs of its own, he upped the levies to a staggering 145%.",
      "Woldenberg reckons that will push Learning Resource\u2019s tariff bill from $2.3 million last year to $100.2 million in 2025. \u201cI wish I had $100 million,\u201d he said. \u201cHonest to God, no exaggeration: It feels like the end of days.\u201d",
      "It might at least be the end of an era of inexpensive consumer goods in America. For four decades, and especially since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, Americans have relied on Chinese factories for everything from smartphones to Christmas ornaments.",
      "As tensions between the world\u2019s two biggest economies \u2014 and geopolitical rivals \u2014 have risen over the past decade, Mexico and Canada have supplanted China as America\u2019s top source of imported goods and services. But China is still No. 3 \u2014 and second behind Mexico in goods alone \u2014 and continues to dominate in many categories.",
      "China produces 97% of America\u2019s imported baby carriages, 96% of its artificial flowers and umbrellas, 95% of its fireworks, 93% of its children\u2019s coloring books and 90% of its combs, according to a report from the Macquarie investment bank.",
      "Over the years, American companies have set up supply chains that depend on thousands of Chinese factories. Low tariffs greased the system. As recently as January 2018, U.S. tariffs on China averaged just over 3%, according to Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "\u201cAmerican consumers created China,\u201d said Joe Jurken, founder of the ABC Group in Milwaukee, which helps U.S. businesses manage supply chains in Asia. \u201cAmerican buyers, the consumers, got addicted to cheap pricing. And the brands and the retailers got addicted to the ease of buying from China.\"",
      "Now Trump, demanding that manufacturers return production to America, is swinging a tariff sledgehammer at the American importers and the Chinese factories they rely on.",
      "\u201cThe consequences of tariffs at this scale could be apocalyptic at many levels,\" said David French, senior vice president of government affairs at the National Retail Foundation.",
      "The Yale University Budget Lab estimates that the tariffs that Trump has announced globally since taking office would lower U.S. economic growth by 1.1 percentage points in 2025.",
      "The tariffs are also likely to push up prices. The University of Michigan's survey of consumer sentiment, out Friday, found that Americans expect long-term inflation to reach 4.4%, up from 4.1% last month.",
      "\"Inflation\u2019s going up in the United States,\" said Stephen Roach, former chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia and now at Yale Law School\u2019s China Center. \u201cConsumers have figured this out as well.\"",
      "It's not just the size of Trump\u2019s tariffs that has businesses bewildered and scrambling; it\u2019s the speed and the unpredictability with which the president is rolling them out.",
      "On Wednesday, the White House said the tariffs on China would hit 125%. A day later, it corrected that: No, the tariffs would be 145%, including a previously announced 20% to pressure China to do more to stop the flow of fentanyl into the United States.",
      "China in turn has imposed a 125% tariff on the U.S. effective Saturday.",
      "\u201cThere is so much uncertainty,\u201d said Isaac Larian, the founder of MGA Entertainment, which makes L.O.L. and Bratz dolls, among other toys. \u201cAnd no business can run on uncertainty.\u201d",
      "His company gets 65% of its product from Chinese factories, a share he is trying to winnow down to 40% by the end of the year. MGA also manufactures in India, Vietnam and Cambodia, but Trump is threatening to levy heavy tariffs on those countries, too, after delaying them for 90 days.",
      "Larian estimates that the price of Bratz dolls could go from $15 to $40 and that of L.O.L. dolls could double to $20 by this year's holiday season.",
      "Even his Little Tikes brand, which is made in Ohio, is not immune. Little Tikes depends on screws and other parts from China. Larian figures the price for its toy cars could rise to $90 from a suggested retail price of $65.",
      "He said MGA would likely cut orders for the fourth quarter because he is worried that higher prices will scare off consumers.",
      "Marc Rosenberg, founder and CEO of The Edge Desk in Deerfield, Illinois, invested millions of dollars of his own money to develop $1,000 ergonomic chairs, which were to start production in China next month.",
      "Now\u2019s he calling off production and exploring markets outside the U.S., including Germany and Italy, where his chairs wouldn\u2019t face Trump\u2019s triple-digit tariffs.",
      "He had looked for ways to make the chairs in the United States and had discussions with potential suppliers in Michigan, but the costs would have been 25% to 30% higher.",
      "\"They didn\u2019t have the skilled labor to do this stuff, and they didn\u2019t have the desire to do it,\u201d Rosenberg said.",
      "Woldenberg\u2019s company in Vernon Hills, Illinois, has been in the family since 1916. It was started by his grandfather as a laboratory supply company and evolved over the years into Learning Resources.",
      "The company specializes in educational toys such as Botley: The Coding Robot and the brainteaser Kanoodle. It employs about 500 people \u2014 90% in the United States \u2014 and makes about 2,400 products in China.",
      "Woldenberg is reeling from the size and suddenness of Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "\u201cThe products I make in China, about 60% of what I do, become economically unviable overnight,\u201d he said. \"In an instant, snap of a finger, they\u2019re kaput.\"",
      "He described Trump\u2019s call for factories to return to the United States as \u201ca joke.\"",
      "\u201cI have been looking for American manufacturers for a long time ... and I have come up with zero companies to partner with,\u201d he said.",

      "A helicopter crash that killed six in New York City has renewed concerns about the safety of the popular sightseeing excursions",
      "NEW YORK -- A helicopter ride giving a thrilling sweep of Manhattan\u2019s iconic skyline has long been on the to-do list for New York City tourists of means.",
      "For several hundred dollars, tour companies fly passengers high above the rivers that encircle the city, showcasing a stunning, bird's-eye view of the Statue of Liberty, One World Trade Center and other monumental landmarks.",
      "But Thursday\u2019s crash that killed a family of five visiting from Spain and the helicopter\u2019s pilot, a Navy SEAL veteran, has renewed concerns about the safety of the popular sightseeing excursions.",
      "Since 2005, five helicopters on commercial sightseeing flights have fallen into the Hudson and East rivers as a result of mechanical failures, pilot errors or collisions, killing 20 people.",
      "Longtime opponents have revived calls to ban or limit \u201cnonessential\u201d helicopter flights, including the roughly 30,000 sightseeing rides over the city each year.",
      "Mayor Eric Adams on Friday said he doesn\u2019t support further restrictions on the aircraft, saying they\u2019re crucial for everything from transporting Wall Street executives to police work, and that tens of thousands of tourist flights happen each year with no problems.",
      "\u201cPeople want to see the city from the sky,\u201d he said on WINS radio, though he added that \"it must be done right.\u201d",
      "The Democrat said the city's airspace is highly regulated, pilots are well-trained and the aircraft are well maintained.",
      "Not everyone has his level of comfort.",
      "\u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t go on them,\u201d Al Yurman, a former investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board, said of helicopter tours. \u201cI feel like the industry doesn\u2019t look after itself the way it should.\u201d",
      "Tourist flights seemed like they might be in jeopardy after a disaster in 2009, when a Liberty Helicopters sightseeing flight carrying Italian visitors collided with a private plane over the Hudson River, killing nine.",
      "After that crash, which involved missed radio communications, a distracted air traffic controller and two pilots who didn't see each other until it was too late, the Federal Aviation Administration created new safety rules for the congested airspace over the city's rivers.",
      "A few years later, New York City cut the number of flights allowed at Manhattan\u2019s downtown heliport in half, capping them at just under 30,000 a year.",
      "Then, in 2018, five people died when a helicopter offering \u201copen door\u201d flights crashed in the East River after a passenger's restraint tether snagged on a fuel switch, stopping the engine. The pilot escaped but the passengers couldn't get out of their safety harnesses and drowned.",
      "That crash prompted more industry scrutiny.",
      "Late last month, the company that arranged that flight, FlyNYON, settled a lawsuit over the crash for $90 million. FlyNYON's chief executive, Patrick Day, said it had made numerous changes to improve safety, including changing its passenger restraint system, switching to a different model of helicopter, adding training for pilots and hiring a safety officer.",
      "\u201cThe introspection and self-critical analysis we have undertaken in the last six-and-a-half years have shaped our view of what it means to be an industry leader, and we\u2019re a safer, smarter, and stronger company for it,\u201d Day said.",
      "The cause of Thursday\u2019s crash is still undetermined.",
      "Videos taken by bystanders showed the Bell 206 helicopter breaking apart mid-flight. The cabin plummeted into the water without its severed tail boom or main rotor, which spun off into a different part of the river and hasn't been recovered.",
      "Nationwide, there were 88 helicopter accidents last year across all sectors \u2014 the lowest in 25 years, according to Jeff Smith, chairman of the Eastern Region Helicopter Council, a trade group for helicopter operators based in Kearny, New Jersey, where many Manhattan tour companies depart.",
      "Helicopter tours, he added, accounted for a small fraction of all those accidents.",
      "\u201cWe shoot for vision zero, which means no fatalities,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe train for that. We preach it. It is a cornerstone of our industry.\u201d",
      "Justin Green, an aviation lawyer and former Marine helicopter pilot, agreed there\u2019s nothing especially problematic about New York\u2019s helicopter tour industry, despite the crashes that seem to happen every few years.",
      "At the same time, he said, tour operators should be required to equip their aircraft with modern safety measures, such as terrain awareness technology.",
      "Steve Cowell, a Colorado-based aviation expert, suggested the FAA should take a more active role in scrutinizing smaller operators with known financial difficulties.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, when people fly, they oftentimes do not check into the safety records or financial viability of the company,\u201d Cowell said. \u201cThey\u2019re placing their trust and confidence in the abilities of not only the pilots but the maintainers.\u201d",
      "New York Helicopter, operator of the aircraft that crashed Thursday, had gone through a bankruptcy and been sued twice by creditors in recent months, an AP review found.",
      "The company declined to answer questions, but released a statement saying it was \u201cprofoundly saddened\" by the deaths of its passengers and pilot.",
      "\u201cThe safety and well-being of our passengers and crew has always been the cornerstone of our operations,\u201d it said.",

      "ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla. -- Animal lovers now have a place to hang out with the \u201cit\u201d animals of the moment \u2014 big furry rodents.",
      "In the back of a real estate office building in what is known as America's oldest city, capybaras are crawling into visitors' laps, munching on corn on the cob and hunting for scratches from humans at The Capybara Cafe in St. Augustine, Florida.",
      "\u201cYou give them lots of scratches and love,\" said Stephanie Angel, who opened The Capybara Cafe late last year. \"A lot of times they\u2019ll climb on your lap because they\u2019re very used to people, and if you\u2019re really good at giving scratches, they\u2019ll actually fall over. So that\u2019s always our goal to get them so comfortable that they fall over.\u201d",
      "Since opening its doors in October in downtown St. Augustine, near the Flagler College campus, hundreds of animal lovers have visited the site to give the capybaras head scratches. Reservations are booked several months in advance by patrons like Leah Macri, who recently visited the northeast Florida location from Orlando with her daughter.",
      "\u201cTheir fur kind of feels like straw a bit,\u201d Macri said.",
      "After entering a reception area with couches and an open pen of baby chicks, visitors are escorted into a smaller room in groups of a half dozen or so people. Blankets are placed over their laps, and three capybaras are brought into the room. Other animals like a skunk, wallaby and armadillo are also introduced into the room, and they crawl among the humans and into their laps. The cost is $49 per person for a half-hour encounter, and $99 for an hour-long encounter that involves the other animals.",
      "Even though she had come for the capybaras, Macri enjoyed holding the armadillo the most.",
      "\u201cHe was the cuddly, like the best. He was just the softest,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was just very sweet.\u201d",
      "The capybara \u2014 a semi-aquatic South American relative of the guinea pig \u2014 is the latest in a long line of \u201cit\u201d animals to get the star treatment in the United States. During last year's holiday shopping season, shoppers could find capybara slippers, purses, robes and bath bombs. Axolotls, owls, hedgehogs, foxes and sloths also had recent turns in the spotlight.",
      "The web-footed capybaras can grow to more than 4 feet (1.2 meters) long and weigh well north of 100 pounds (45 kilograms).",
      "Several zoos and wildlife parks across the U.S. offer encounters with capybaras, but Angel said none of them provide the intimacy with the animals that visitors get at the Capybara Cafe.",
      "Angel said she plans to open another capybara cafe across the state in St. Petersburg, Florida, soon. The St. Augustine location doesn't sell coffee or hot food, like a cafe implied in its name, but it does sell capybara-themed T-shirts, coffee mugs and stuffed animals.",
      "The cafe was created to financially support the Hastings, Florida-based nonprofit Noah's Ark Sanctuary Inc., an animal refuge, Angel said.",
      "Chris Cooper, who visited the Capybara Cafe with his wife, was surprised at how rough and coarse the capybaras' hair was.",
      "\u201cAnd I wasn't expecting how affectionate they were,\u201d said Cooper, who drove up 157 miles (253 kilometers) from Weeki Wachee to see the critters. \u201cThey enjoyed the hands-on rubs.\u201d",

      "He was detained March 8 in the lobby of his university-owned apartment.",
      "Khalil isn\u2019t accused of breaking any laws during the protests at Columbia.

      "Khalil\u2019s lawyers have challenged the legality of his detention, saying the Trump administration is trying to deport him for an activity that is protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has cited a rarely used statute to justify Khalil\u2019s deportation, which gives him power to deport those who pose \u201cpotentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\u201d",
      "Immigration Judge Jamee E. Comans ruled Friday the government's contention that Khalil's presence in the U.S. posed \u201cpotentially serious foreign policy consequences\u201d was enough to satisfy requirements for his deportation.",
      "Comans said the government had \u201cestablished by clear and convincing evidence that he is removable.\u201d",
      "Federal judges in New York and New Jersey previously ordered the government not to deport Khalil while his case plays out in court.",
      "Khalil's attorneys said they will keep fighting. They plan to appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals. They can also pursue an asylum case on his behalf.",
      "Even though the judge found Khalil removable on foreign policy grounds, nothing will happen quickly in the immigration proceeding, his attorney, Marc Van Der Hout, said.",
      "The judge gave them until April 23 to seek a waiver.",

The Alabama Department of Public Health agreed to take several steps as part of the settlement, including not fining people with inadequate home systems, creating a comprehensive plan for the region and other steps.",
      "The agreement was the result of the Justice Department's first environmental justice investigation under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.",

      "SALEM, Ore. -- Oregon's DMV says it has found new cases of people being registered to vote despite not showing proof of U.S. citizenship, as it continues to review voter registration records following the disclosure of the errors last fall.",
      "A DMV report released Thursday revealed 118 new cases, in addition to the roughly 1,600 known cases of people who didn't show proof of citizenship yet were registered to vote. Nearly all of the newfound errors, or 111 cases, involved people whose information was entered into a previous computer system that was in place between 2010 and 2020.",
      "In total, the technical and clerical errors are so far known to have resulted in 1,739 people being mistakenly registered to vote, according to the Secretary of State's office, which said many were later confirmed to be citizens. As of this month, the office has determined that only 30 of those people voted in an election \u2014 a tiny fraction of the state's roughly 3 million registered voters.",
      "The Secretary of State\u2019s elections division investigated the 30 cases, according to the office's webpage on the DMV automatic voter registration errors. Eight cases were closed, 19 are still under active investigation by the office and three were referred to the Oregon Department of Justice for further investigation.",
      "Most of the clerical errors stemmed from a drop-down menu option in the DMV's computer system that staff used when entering personal information, according to authorities.",
      "\u201cNone of these people intended to register, represented themselves as eligible to vote, or made any claim to U.S. citizenship. We are sorry for the error and want to be clear that the people mistakenly registered bear no responsibility for it,\u201d the Secretary of State's webpage says.",
      "The DMV has been reviewing records and issuing monthly reports since the errors were revealed last fall. The mistakes occurred in part because Oregon allows some residents who aren\u2019t citizens to obtain driver\u2019s licenses, and the state\u2019s so-called \u201cMotor Voter\u201d law automatically registers most people to vote when they seek a new license or ID.",
      "The DMV will continue sampling Motor Voter data on a monthly basis through 2025. Both the department and the Secretary of State's office say they have put new controls in place to prevent the error from occurring.",
      "The DMV resumed automatic voter registrations in February after Gov. Tina Kotek had ordered a pause because of the errors.",

      "A Cuban woman who had come to the United States illegally has been sentenced to 7 1/2 years in prison for her part in a human smuggling operation that led to the deaths of 16 people",
      "MIAMI -- A Cuban woman who had come to the United States illegally was sentenced Friday to 7 1/2 years in prison for her part in a human smuggling operation that led to the deaths of 16 people.",
      "Yaquelin Dominguez-Nieves, 26, who had been living in Sebring, Florida, was sentenced in Miami federal court, according to court records. She pleaded guilty in January to conspiring to smuggle people into the U.S.",
      "According to court documents, Dominguez-Nieves and her then-boyfriend, who was still living in Cuba, organized a human smuggling operation in November 2022. Dominguez-Nieves collected at least $11,500 from the migrants\u2019 family members in South Florida with the promise to bring the migrants from Cuba into the U.S.",
      "The boyfriend, who has not been arrested, loaded about 18 migrants onto a small fishing vessel with no life jackets and with a captain who did not appear to know how to operate the vessel, according to the two survivors.",
      "The vessel sank about 30 miles (50 kilometers) into its journey. The victims included children ranging from nine months to seven years old, as well as two 16-year-olds, officials said. Four of the migrants\u2019 bodies were recovered at sea, and their cause of death was ruled drowning.",

      "MISSION, Kan. -- With egg prices stubbornly high, the internet has offered up a host of alternatives, with crafters painting rocks and influencers dyeing everything from marshmallows to potatoes.",
      "\u201cFinally a use for B sized potatoes!!\u201d one commenter wrote in response to a video posted on Facebook.",
      "But amid the laughing emojis, LOLs and people simply posting \u201chuh,\u201d there has been a lot of interest from price-conscious parents as U.S. egg prices increased again last month to reach a new record high of $6.23 per dozen. Relief could be coming: There is evidence that prices are falling, and grocery stores may start offering discounts to get shoppers in the door.",
      "But even with all that, egg prices are higher than ever. That has the idea of coloring potatoes or rocks, which first made the rounds after a 2023 spike in prices, making a resurgence.",
      "One video that is circulating shows a grinning mom filling cupcake tins with dye. Her child then skewered marshmallows with toothpicks before gently lowering them into the dye and proudly displaying the creations on a glass platter. Another influencer created marshmallow chicks by dipping marshmallows in yellow food coloring, dabbing dots of black icing to create eyes and and then attaching orange M&Ms for a nose and feet.",
      "Other videos feature shoppers plucking hefty bags of potatoes off the shelf, along with egg dye.",
      "\u201cPotatoes are about the only thing I can afford,\" one grateful online commenter posted. Another boiled it down into a single-word response: \u201cCheaper.\u201d",
      "Kelly Friedl of Chicago dyes eggs for Easter with her two kids every year. But because of this year's high prices, she came up with an alternative: foil eggs. Cut egg shapes out of cardboard, wrap them in foil, and you have shiny eggs to decorate and reuse.",
      "\u201cOur mom used to buy three dozen eggs,\u201d said Friedl, 59, who leads a childcare products company called Urban Infant. \u201cI don\u2019t think we even ate all the eggs, but it\u2019s the memory of doing something with your mom.\u201d",
      "For many families like Friedl's, dyeing eggs isn\u2019t so much about eating eggs. That meant having some go bad in the fridge wasn\u2019t such a big deal when a dozen cost less than $2, as they consistently did for years, outside the 2015 bird flu outbreak and the current one. But not now.",
      "Paas, a supplier of egg dyeing kits, said that while 94% of those who celebrate Easter will dye eggs this year, 78% of families said they would dye fewer of them than in past years due to the expense.",
      "The craft retailer Michaels said their craft egg kits are flying off the shelves. Sales of two of the kits are up 20% compared to the same time last year, said Melissa Mills, senior vice president and general merchandising manager at Michaels.",
      "Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest retailer, declined to comment on sales of dyeable plastic eggs and other alternatives, but said it wasn\u2019t the first year it carried them. Among some options for shoppers: a carton of 12 plastic eggs that include four liquid dye packets and four egg-dyeing bags and Play-Doh Easter eggs.",
      "Despite the change in tradition, Friedl\u2019s family is looking forward to the holiday.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a super crafty family and the most valued gift in our house is a gift that someone has made you,\u201d Friedl said. \u201cWe get together every year and do eggs, and we love it.\u201d",

      "Well, well, well.",
      "In a US customs messaging note quietly slipped out in the early hours of Saturday, a series of numbers were listed as exempt from the 125% tariff on goods entering the country from China.",
      "The code \"8517.13.00.00\" means very little to most of the world, but in the US customs list it represents smartphones.",
      "The inclusion meant that the number one Chinese export to America by value last year was exempted from the import taxes, alongside other electronic devices and components, including semiconductors, solar cells and memory cards.",
      "In the context of the US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick just days ago announcing that part of the point of escalating tariffs on China was to bring back iPhone production to the US, this was a stunning about-turn.",
      "The US has now excluded the single biggest Chinese export, and certainly the most high profile finished good from tariffs, without publicly announcing it at first.",
      "Trump exempts smartphones and computers from new tariffs",
      "Why Trump is hitting China on trade - and what might happen next",
      "It is worth considering what would have happened in the absence of this exemption.",
      "The effect of 125% tariffs on Apple's Zhengzou manufacturing facility in eastern China would have started to show in weeks at most across American Apple stores. It would have been a totemic \"sticker shock\" for the White House tumultuous tariff push.",
      "According to one Counterpoint, a global technology market research firm, as much as 80% of Apple's iPhones intended for US sale are made in China.",
      "The tech giant's manufacturing profit margins are estimated to be  between 40-60%. Typical iPhone prices might have moved closer to $2,000 than $1,000. The other option for Apple could have been to spread the cost across all of its global prices, but would the rest of the world accepted paying the Trump tariff tax?",
      "A very public repricing of iPhones has been avoided, but still may occur if, as the White House House has said, that the previously imposed 20% tariffs on China related to the powerful opioid fentanyl, remain in place.",
      "Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, is a key player here. He can walk into a meeting with both US president Donald Trump and China president Xi Jinping. It is not an outlandish prediction to suggest that, if it comes, any peace in the US-China trade war could be brokered by Cook.",
      "That's based on his deep fundamental role in connecting the two economies. He was hand selected by Apple's co-founder Steve Jobs for his unrivalled expertise in just-in-time supply logistics.",
      "'Art of the Repeal'",
      "This is all moving rather quickly now. Weekend reports in the US press claim White House trade hawk Pete Navarro is being side lined too in favour of US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.",
      "Navarro was the author of the infamous equation that set so-called reciprocal tariff rates in proportion to the size of a country's trade surplus with the US, calling it \"the sum of all cheating\".",
      "Bessent is now leading negotiations with trade partners seeking to avoid the reapplication of those rates after the 90-day pause.",
      "There is a big question after 10 days of chaos. What is the incentive for other nations to offer much here? The Trump administration is clearly spooked by the bond market reaction to the president's trade plans, and questions surrounding the safe haven status of US debt for investors.",
      "In trying to stave off effective interest rates on bonds rising to 5%, the US needs deals more than just those in surplus countries.",
      "Indeed this weekend's broad range of exemptions are in and of themselves an astonishing U-turn on the principle embodied in the notorious tariff chart held up by Trump in the Rose Garden.",
      "Just under a quarter of China's total exports are now exempt from the 125% tariff, according to Capital Economics.",
      "The consultancy suggests there are other big winners from the exemptions, with 64% of exports to the US from Taiwan, 44% from Malaysia, and just under 30% from both Vietnam and Thailand now also exempt.",
      "The 10% universal tariff is now riddled with exemptions, and the biggest carve outs are for many nations with massive trade surpluses from electronics manufacturing.",
      "The new tariff equation is to give an effective discount from the universal 10% (through exemptions) to those with the biggest surpluses. For example, Taiwan has a $74bn surplus with the US, and Vietnam a $124bn surplus.",

      "The business secretary has refused to confirm if the government can get the sufficient raw material supplies in time to keep the blast furnaces at British Steel running, after it took control of the Chinese-owned plant.",
      "Emergency legislation was rushed through Parliament on Saturday to prevent owners Jingye shutting down its two blast furnaces in Scunthorpe.",
      "Asked if he could guarantee the furnaces would remain open, Jonathan Reynolds said he would not comment \"on the commercial aspect of supply\" but the takeover gave the \"opportunity\" to obtain the coal needed.",
      "The government said Jingye had been selling off raw materials, as well as not ordering more, before officials took control.",
      "Asked several times by Laura Kuenssberg on whether he was sure he would be able to get the supply of coal before current stocks run out, Reynolds insisted \"I'm not going to get into that\" but the takeover \"was essential to maintaining steel production in the UK\".",
      "Speaking on the programme, Reynolds said the situation remains \"difficult and challenging\".",
      "But Saturday's emergency legislation \"enables\" the government to keep the blast furnaces working, he said. Once a blast furnace is switched off it becomes incredibly difficult to restart production.",
      "\"If we hadn't acted the blast furnaces were gone and in the UK primary steel production would have gone,\" he said.",
      "\"If we hadn't acted, you'd be asking how we support the thousands who've lost their jobs.\"",
      "The Conservatives have criticised the government for not stepping in sooner to save the plant and protect jobs.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Tory shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said \"the government could have seen this coming earlier\".",

      "The company rejected an offer of support in the region of \u00a3500 million, the government said, instead demanding more than twice that figure with few guarantees the blast furnaces would stay open.",
      "In the Commons on Saturday, Reynolds said Jingye had not been negotiating \"in good faith\", while on Sunday he suggested it had not been acting \"rationally\".",
      "Jingye had put the UK's ability to produced virgin steel at risk, Reynolds told the programme - adding \"it might not be sabotage, it might be neglect\".",
      "British Steel's plant in Scunthorpe is the last plant in the UK capable of producing virgin steel, which has fewer imperfections and is used in major construction projects like new buildings and railways.",
      "Were the plant to cease production, the UK would become the only member of the G7 group of leading economies without the ability to make it - a prospect the government views as a risk to the country's long-term economic security.",
      "The government is looking for a buyer to take over British Steel.",
      "Earlier on Sunday, Reynolds told Sky News he would not sell it to another Chinese company.",
      "He said: \"I think we have got to be clear about what is the sort of sector where, actually, we can promote and co-operate, and ones frankly where we can't. I wouldn't personally bring a Chinese company into our steel sector.\"",
      "Reynolds told the BBC he could not say what the British Steel takeover will cost taxpayers while a buyer is found.",
      "He argued the market value of the company is \"effectively zero\" and the taxpayer will have to \"stand behind\" the company's losses of around \u00a3700,000 a day.",
      "Asked about whether the 2019 sale to Jingye was a mistake by the Boris Johnson government, Griffith said the Conservatives had approved \"the only deal on the table\" - and with support from unions and local MPs.",

      "Reform UK Leader Nigel Farage criticised the Conservatives for selling a \"strategic industry to a foreign government\".",

      "\"I can't keep up with the president. Every day is something new,\" said Anna Woods, 42, who recently received a message from her son's summer camp warning that the tariffs might affect pricing of standard gear such as T-shirts.",

      "\"I just feel like we're living in uncertain times,\" she said, adding: \"I do need to make some purchases .... Everything is going up.\"",
      "The latest tariffs include a 10% tax on the vast majority of imports - and an eye-popping 145% duty on goods from China, which is the third biggest supplier of imports to the US after the European Union and Mexico and a key source of essentials such as smartphones, shoes and umbrellas.",
      "The measures followed previous orders that added 25% levies on cars, steel, aluminium and some goods from Canada and Mexico.",
      "In all, Trump's orders have pushed the average effective tariff rate on imports in the US to the highest level in more than a century.",
      "In stores, the immediate impact has been limited, since many firms stockpiled some products in anticipation of some tariffs.",

      "The first thing I notice is the lack of a strong aroma. There's no familiar, powerful waft of cocoa when opening this bag of sweets, the packet of biscuits, or the caramel-filled truffles.",
      "And as I taste each one as part of my solemn commitment to inform the public, I don't get quite the same burst of chocolate flavour that you might expect from treats with that familiar, waxy, light brown chocolate-like coating. The thing is, this isn't chocolate. It's made with sunflower seeds. Or fava (also called broad) beans.",
      "The selection before me is just a smattering of the non-cocoa containing alternatives to chocolate that are creeping into the European retail market right now. Their makers have spied an opportunity, partly because real chocolate prices are soaring.",
      "\"The average increase in price for chocolate was 9% over 2024,\" says Richard Caines, principal analyst in UK food and drink research at market research firm Mintel. \"In January just gone, it's shot up by 14%.\"",
      "That's the retail price of chocolate. The wholesale price of the key ingredient, cocoa \u2013 which is made from fermented, roasted and ground cacao beans \u2013 has increased by an astonishing 300% in 2024.",
      "\"I have been looking at this chocolate market for quite a few years now \u2013 I don't remember a big story like this on costs going up,\" adds Mr Caines.",
      "A key reason for this increase is climate change-related weather impacts on cacao farms, particularly in West Africa.",
      "Plus, some farmers in Ghana are turning away from cacao production in favour of illegal gold-mining, according to reports.",
      "It means that there was a deficit of roughly 500,000 tonnes of cocoa in the global market last year.",
      "Real chocolate could become a \"luxury\" item in the future says Massimo Sabatini, co-founder and chief executive of Italian firm Foreverland, which makes a cocoa powder alternative called Choruba.",
      "The company opened its production facility in March, where staff process not cacao beans but carob husks.",
      "Carob trees produce small, brown, banana-shaped pods containing seeds. It's possible to process the pods to create a cocoa-like powder. This chocolate alternative has a long history, however \u2013 and not a very happy one.",
      "A New Yorker article claims a generation was \"traumatized\" by carob-based confectionary during the 1970s. It didn't taste as good as real chocolate, and it didn't melt in your mouth in the same way, apparently.",
      "But Mr Sabatini insists that he and his colleagues have come up with a worthy product. He acknowledges that carob \"really doesn't taste like chocolate\" but adds that Foreverland's fermentation and roasting process removes some of the carob flavour to get it closer to cocoa.",
      "Their carob-based dark chocolate alternative is sweeter and more caramel-like than real dark chocolate, he explains.",
      "There could be health benefits to this. \"We can reduce drastically the sugar content,\" says Mr Sabatini. Carob is also higher in fibre and lower in fat than cocoa.",
      "German food manufacturer Planet A Foods has developed a different chocolate alternative. Sara Marquart, co-founder and chief technology officer, says her goal is not to replace chocolate but to help fill the gap in the market caused by volatility in cocoa availability and prices.",
      "Unlike Foreverland, Planet A Foods have chosen sunflower seeds as the key ingredient in their cocoa powder alternative, ChoViva.",
      "\"We process sunflower seeds like cocoa beans,\" explains Dr Marquart. \"It's a highly abundant ingredient, there's millions and millions of tonnes on the market.\"",
      "ChoViva is now present in roughly 35 different retail products, mostly on the market in Germany and France \u2013 though it also appears in mini egg-shaped sweets sold by Aldi in the UK. The sweets are made with peanuts and have a chocolate-like coating containing ChoViva.",
      "When I try them, the flavour is overwhelmingly dominated by the salty peanut at the egg's core. But the chocolatey texture of the coating is impressive. The same applies to ChoViva-covered biscuits made by the firm.",
      "I note that the chocolate-like coating is rather thin and not overly flavourful. But again, the texture is pretty much what you'd expect from real chocolate, though not quite as melty.",
      "The company's ChoViva-covered popcorn is probably the most chocolatey item I try \u2013 the popcorn doesn't usurp its coating.",
      "Overall, there's nothing here that would perturb a consumer. Especially one unaware that these products don't actually contain chocolate.",
      "A UK start-up also keen to compete in this space is Nukoko. Two of its founders previously ran a real chocolate business and teamed up with a food scientist to form their new venture.",
      "\"We saw first-hand the issues with the chocolate supply chain,\" says Ross Newton, co-founder. Like Foreverland and Planet A Foods, Nukoko has opted for a key ingredient that the firm can source and process locally \u2013 to reduce food miles and insulate against supply chain risks. But in Nukoko's case the raw material of choice is not carob or sunflower seeds but fava beans.",
      "\"There's around a million tonnes harvested in the UK every year,\" says Mr Newton.",
      "It's early days for the company but he adds that he hopes to begin selling their cocoa powder alternative to food firms later this year.",
      "Mr Newton says imitating the flavour of real chocolate is very hard but that, out of 25 crucial flavour compounds in real chocolate, his company's product manages to include 24 of them \u2013 though in some cases at slightly different concentrations.",
      "The company sends me four caramel-filled truffles to try. The caramel totally dominates and the truffles are very sweet. But the chocolate alternative is as smooth and glossy as you'd expect, and very satisfying to chew.",
      "\"Anything new that comes out has got to meet equal taste expectations,\" says Mr Caines, noting how discerning consumers are when it comes to their favourite chocolate-containing products. Getting them to embrace alternatives devoid of cocoa will be no mean feat.",
      "He adds that alternatives might fare best when used in bakery products \u2013 such as the chips in chocolate chip cookies: \"The chocolate is not so much the star of the show there so it might actually be more acceptable.\"",
      "Should chocolate alternatives meet with success, there is some risk that this could negatively impact cacao farmers, says Tonya Lander, a lecturer in biology at Oxford University.",
      "\"It's something that should be worked through with farmers or farmer collectives,\" she says. Cacao farmers are among the poorest agricultural workers in the world.",
      "Nukoko, Planet A Foods and Foreverland all say they don't aim to replace chocolate, rather, the goal is to fill the gap left by cocoa production shortfalls.",
      "Dr Lander and colleagues have studied environmental factors that influence yield from cacao trees.",
      "Poor pollination and high temperatures negatively affect how much cacao the trees produce, the researchers report in a study published in February.",
      "By shading cacao trees on plantations, for example, it might be possible to improve harvests and potentially reduce the volatility of cocoa supplies. Such interventions, besides switching to cocoa alternatives, could help satisfy confectionary-obsessed consumers in the coming years.",

    "summary": "Countries break ten-year deadlock to agree measures to reduce commercial shipping emissions.",
    "story": [
      "Countries have agreed a global deal to tackle shipping emissions, after nearly ten years of negotiations.",
      "The agreement covers the vast majority of the world's commercial shipping and means that starting in 2028, ship owners will have to use increasingly cleaner fuels or face fines.",
      "The deal was nearly derailed after Saudi Arabia forced a last minute vote and the US pulled out of talks in London \u2013 but it eventually passed on Friday.",
      "Small island states and environmental groups were angry that a blanket tax was not  agreed to and called the deal \"unfit for purpose\".",
      "Shipping agrees net-zero goal but critics unmoved",
      "Clean energy's share of world's electricity reaches 40%, report says",
      "Shipping accounts for around 3% of global emissions. But unlike many other sectors it has struggled to reduce its carbon footprint over the last decade and is reliant on fossil fuels like diesel.",
      "But the agreement means it is now the first industry in the world with internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.",
      "The agreement was passed at the UN's International Maritime Organisation (IMO) meeting.",
      "It will require owners of large international vessels to increase their use of less carbon intensive fuels or face a penalty of up to $380 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions they emit from burning fuel.",
      "Although the final agreement was passed, it had to be put to a vote - an unusual move for UN bodies that usually agree measures by consensus.",
      "The vote was requested by Saudi Arabia, who did not support the agreement, and this position was shared by a dozen other oil-producing nations, including Russia.",
      "Although they opposed the proposal, they will be bound to implement it because they are members of the IMO.",
      "There have been moves to improve the efficiency of ships, but emissions have continued to increase in line with global trade - 90% of which is carried by ships.",
      "The most effective measure would be to switch ships away from fossil fuels to green fuels, but that would be very expensive.",
      "\"There is no fuel as cheap as diesel that ships use today because when we take crude oil out of the ground, we take out all the nice bits, that's the kerosene for aviation, diesel and petrol for cars,\" said Faig Abbasov, programme director for maritime transport at think tank Transport and Environment.",
      "\"Whatever is left at the bottom, that's what ships burn. So no fuel will be as cheap as this because not much energy goes into its production,\" he said.",
      "In comparison, the most environmentally friendly fuels like e-kerosene and ammonia are created from initially splitting water atoms to obtain hydrogen, which is a very energy-intensive and costly process.",
      "Figures vary depending on the fuel type but the World Economic Forum estimates that these green fuels are 3-4 times more expensive to produce.",
      "\"There's still a huge cost gap between the fossil fuels and the zero emission fuels and we need to close this gap. So you need carrots and sticks and in shipping the stick is not that big yet to use sustainable fuels,\" said Refke Gunnewijk, program manager for sustainable transport at the Port of Rotterdam.",
      "Some island states also abstained and said the deal was a watered down version of what they hoped for. An earlier proposal to apply a blanket carbon tax or levy - which would have been a world first - was dropped.",
      "\"Let us be clear about who has abandoned 1.5\u00b0C. Saudi Arabia, the US and fossil fuel allies pushed down the numbers to an untenable level and blocked progress at every turn,\" said Ralph Regenvanu, minister of energy and climate change for Vanuatu.",
      "Their disappointment was shared by environmental groups.",
      "\"This week, IMO member states squandered a golden opportunity for the global shipping sector to show the world how it can turn the tide on catastrophic climate heating, putting their own goals out of reach\", said Delaine McCullough, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition.",
      "It is estimated that the agreement could achieve an 8% reduction in emissions for the sector by 2030, according to the maritime consultancy UMAS. This would be short of the IMO's target agreed two years ago to cut emissions by 20% by the end of the decade.",
      "But China and Brazil had previously raised concerns that a levy could result in a significant price increase for basic goods like food. Both countries backed the final deal.",
      "Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum, said that the deal was a compromise.",
      "\"It is a difficult set of decisions, but it is the first regulation of its kind and that is to be celebrated,\" he said.",
      "Listen: How to clean up the shipping industry",
      "Listen: How to clean up the shipping industry",
      "Fahnestock added it was unclear if the penalties were enough to close the cost gap between the fuel types.",
      "\"You may have incentivised shipowners to prepare a bit for the future fuels but whether the signal is strong enough to get the billions of dollars of investment into the production facilities for these fuels - I don't think these regulations will overcome that. I think more will need to be done,\" he said.",
      "Any money raised from the penalties will be put into a \"Net Zero\" fund, with money spent on scaling up greener fuels and supporting developing countries.",
      "It is this \"redistribution\" that prompted the US delegation to pull out of the talks on Tuesday night. A letter was sent by the US to all countries at the IMO negotiations saying any levy would cause inflation and if it was passed then \"reciprocal measures\" would be taken.",
      "Although the US move was at odds with its long-held position at the IMO, it was in keeping with President Trump's push back on climate action seen over the last few months - such as withdrawing the US from the Paris Climate Agreement.",
      "But industry and country delegates appeared unperturbed when speaking to the BBC on Wednesday and continued with negotiations.",
      "The US only flags 178 cargo ships that represent 0.57% of worldwide commercial shipping tonnage. So if it took the decision not to implement the new proposals it is unlikely to make a significant difference to the funds raised.",

    "story": [
      "There were some heroic efforts from Donald Trump and those around him on Wednesday night to suggest the past seven days were something other than absolute chaos.",
      "By this reading, Trump's 4D game of chess has left China in check. Certainly the Chinese economy faces a massive hit from punitive tariffs in its biggest market. But even accounting for the President's roll back, the US has still erected a massive protectionist tariff wall, not seen since the 1930s.",
      "The world is left with a universal 10% tariff, irrespective of whether that country (for example the UK or Australia) actually sells less to the US than the US sells to it.",
      "There is now no difference between the EU, which clearly does have a massive trade deficit in goods and was preparing to retaliate, and the UK.",
      "There is also an anxious wait to find out what comes next. One of the questions is whether President Trump pushes ahead with tariffs on medicines, the UK's second biggest goods export.",
      "Plus there is potential logistical chaos on the cards from a little-noticed multi-million dollar port tax for every cargo vessel docking in the US that was \"made in China\". That is more than half of the global merchant fleet - and it is due next week.",
      "Even with Trump's stated 90 day pause on implementing higher tariffs, there remains too much uncertainty for companies to go through the rigmarole of rerouting global trade.",
      "The China fallout",
      "The central issue now, however, is that the world's two great economic superpowers are facing off against each other like rutting stags.",
      "Tariffs at these sky-high rates are massively hitting business between two nations which together account for around 3% of the entire world's trade. The main motorway of the global economy is effectively shut.",
      "The visible tangible consequences of all this will become very real very quickly: Chinese factories will close, workers will stroll from plant to plant looking for work.",
      "Beijing will need to organise a stimulus package to account for the loss of whole percentage points of GDP, the kind of thing that happens when a natural disaster flattens a major city. Painful, but manageable at a cost, though not forever.",
      "Meanwhile the US will see consumer prices surge. President Trump might try to order these US companies not to raise prices, but the effect will come through soon enough.",
      "In theory this will be in sharp contrast to what is happening in other countries in the world. Across the border in Canada, or in Europe, not only will there not be such China-sourced price rises, there could be price cuts.",
      "From trade wars to currency wars",
      "Trade wars on this scale do not stay confined to the flow of goods. They tend to become currency wars.",
      "What we saw this week was the trade turmoil spread to credit markets, especially the US bond market, having already hit share prices.",
      "Indeed there was an invaluable reveal for the game theory of this conflict. The Trump administration revealed a key pressure point with its concern about the \"yippy\" - as Trump called it - bond market.",
      "As trading in US government debt continued overnight in Asia, the effective interest rate on these bonds rose to 5%.",
      "This sort of borrowing should not move in such an erratic fashion.",
      "The last time this happened was in the \"Dash for Cash\", the key moment of financial fragility at the very beginning of the pandemic. The world was focussed on life or death in March 2020, but this potential further crisis was alleviated only by emergency action.",
      "Effectively, the President's row back was a form of emergency policy change.",
      "Was the Chinese government behind this rash of US government bond sales in Asia? Probably not. However, what happened on Wednesday highlighted a vulnerability for Trump.",
      "China is the second biggest holder of US government debt in the world and if it chose to, dumping all that debt would be catastrophic for America. But doing so would be a form of mutually assured economic destruction - the losses for China would be huge.",
      "More importantly, what the bond markets were telling Trump is that they are deeply sceptical about his tariff policy.",
      "The US does have the Federal Reserve, which does have some power to tranquillise bond markets. But right now it does not look like its chairman Jerome Powell will ride to the rescue.",
      "The bond market scepticism echoes the sentiment of the ascendant Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. He is now pushing for Trump to reach trade deals with their allies because the US needs them to take on China.",
      "Given the US was previously calling these same close allies cheaters, looters and pillagers, there is no way this was the strategy all along.",
      "This does matter. The US needs the EU, UK, the rest of the G7 on side in terms of China. China probably needs those countries just to stay neutral, and carry on soaking up its exports.",
      "The rest of the world has seen Trump's team struggle to explain tariffing penguin islands or poor African economies and the President himself recirculating the suggestion he was crashing stock markets on purpose. And they've witnessed the fact that the tariff rates were changed after they came into effect and also the absurd nature of the equation used to calculate them.",
      "It's in this context that Trump's handling of the situation has handed leverage back to the rest of the world, because neither friend nor foe will know quite what they are negotiating  with this America.",
      "There is a calm, welcomed by all, but it could be rather brief.",
      "Trump has turned his back on the foundation of US economic might - the fallout will be messy",
      "War has changed Zelensky - but now is the time for him to transform again",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 16:37:19 GMT",
    "summary": "Some analysts say that if costs incurred by tariffs pass to consumers, US iPhone prices could rise by hundreds of dollars.",
    "story": [
      "The world's most popular gadgets - phones, laptops, tablets, smartwatches - could be about to get a lot more expensive in the US.",
      "Many of them are made in China, which now faces a 145% tariff on its goods imported to the US, under President Donald Trump's controversial trade policy.",
      "The effect this may have on the iPhone and its maker Apple is under the spotlight - with some analysts saying if costs are passed onto consumers, iPhone prices in the US could rise by hundreds of dollars.",
      "And if the tariffs impact the value of the dollar, it could become more expensive to import iPhones and other devices around the world - potentially leading to higher prices in UK shops.",
      "Ben Wood of CCS Insight told the BBC that if tariffs remain in place, Apple may raise iPhone prices globally when the next iteration is launched.",
      "\"It is unlikely the company would want to have differentiated pricing globally,\" he said - as the tech giant would want to avoid people buying the device cheaply in the UK and selling it on for profit in the US.",
      "Though others say they believe it could result in cheaper prices if firms which normally send their goods to the US instead send them to countries which don't have such steep tariffs, like the UK.",
      "And there may be a significant change if the cost of tariffs is passed onto consumers globally - longer contracts to spread out the cost of the device.",
      "While a phone contract may typically last two years, Mr Wood said some firms already offer four year deals, and he believed \"we might see five-year contracts\" in 2025.",
      "\"One could argue it is almost like having a mortgage for your smartphone,\" he said.",
      "Where are iPhones made?",
      "The US is a major market for iPhones and Apple accounted for more than half of its smartphones sales last year, according to Counterpoint Research.",
      "It says as much as 80% of Apple's iPhones intended for US sale are made in China, with the remaining 20% made in India.",
      "Along with fellow smartphone giants such as Samsung, Apple has been trying to diversify its supply chains to avoid over-reliance on China in recent years.",
      "India and Vietnam emerged as frontrunners for additional manufacturing hubs.",
      "As tariffs took effect, Apple reportedly looked to speed up and increase its production of India-produced devices in recent days.",
      "Reuters reported on Thursday that Apple chartered cargo flights to ship more than 600 tons of iPhones from India to the US.",
      "Amid Trump's 90-day pause on tariffs, including those levied on India, the country may be set to benefit from an iPhone manufacturing boost.",
      "The BBC has approached Apple for comment on the impact of tariffs on their operations and prices, but has not had any response yet.",
      "How exposed is Apple to tariffs?",
      "Trump and his advisors have said the aim of its tariffs are to encourage more US manufacturing.",
      "However, the tech industry relies on a global network of suppliers for product components and assembly.",
      "This, and finding skilled workers to match the fast pace and low cost of production in Asia, means relocating supply chains is no simple feat.",
      "Apple committed a $500bn (\u00a3385bn) investment in the US in February - which the Trump administration believes will result in more homegrown manufacturing.",
      "But Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said shifting parts of its supply chain from cheaper manufacturing hubs in Asia to the US will take a lot of time, and money.",
      "\"The reality is it would take 3 years and $30 billion dollars in our estimation to move even 10% of its supply chain from Asia to the US with major disruption in the process,\" he wrote on X on 3 April.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Will iPhone prices go up?",
      "Apple have not revealed yet whether they plan to pass on the costs of the tariffs onto consumers in the US and increase prices.",
      "Some analysts believe Apple is in a more fortunate position than others, having reaped more money from its products than it has spent on making them.",
      "\"As a company with lucrative margins on its devices, Apple can absorb some of the tariff-induced cost increases without significant financial impact, at least in the short term,\" says Forrester principal analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee.",
      "But he notes the company's strong branding and popularity may allow it to pass some costs to consumers without too much backlash.",
      "\"The brand commands better loyalty than its competitors, and it is unlikely that a manageable price increase will send these customers fleeing into the arms of Android-based competitors.\"",
      "Some estimates suggest iPhone prices in the US could as much as triple if costs were passed to consumers.",
      "Following Trump's tariff increase on China to 125%, the cost for a China-made iPhone 16 Pro Max with 256GB storage would have surged from $1,199 to $1,999, according to estimates by investment banking firm UBS.",
      "They estimate a less significant increase on the iPhone 16 Pro 128GB storage - which is made in India - by five percent from $999 to $1046.",
      "While some analysts such as Dan Ives have suggested that the cost of a \"Made in USA\" iPhone could soar to as much as $3500.",
      "What can consumers do about it?",
      "There's still plenty of uncertainty about what happens next, and how companies like Apple will respond to tariffs remains to be seen.",
      "This hasn't stopped some US customers reportedly rushing to Apple stores to buy its smartphones.",
      "The BBC spoke to shoppers outside an Apple Store in New York who had bought products in fear of a potential price hike.",
      "Anthony Cacioppo, a 53-year-old DJ and security technician, purchased the new iPhone.",

      "\"I bought it because the tariffs are coming, I want to buy before the prices go up and I expect they will,\" said Julia Baumann, a personal finance editor, of her new MacBook.",
      "We will likely have to wait until the autumn to see how much the next iPhone will cost.",
      "But if it looks like costs incurred by tariffs will result in higher price tags, some may look to rival handsets or second-hand devices.",
      "CCS Insight estimates that 5.5m second-hand smartphones will be sold in the UK in 2025, representing 29.7% of the total market.",
      "The iPhone remains one of the most expensive smartphones on the market - and brands such as Google and Samsung offer phones with similar features at a lower cost.",
      "The other option, and perhaps the most cost-effective, could be for people to skip upgrades to newer iPhone models and look to slightly older, cheaper versions.",
      "\"The path of least resistance would be to keep the smartphone they already have for longer,\" said Mr Wood.",

      "US shares have rocketed after US President Donald Trump said he would suspend steep tariffs on goods from most countries, and instead impose a 10% import tax rate.",
      "The White House said it was backing off on higher levies for trade partners that had agreed to negotiate, although Trump said he would raise tariffs on goods from China even further, to at least 125% \"effective immediately\".",
      "The S&P 500 soared 9.5% in the biggest one-day rally since 2008, following days of turmoil sparked by the tariffs.",
      "Trump's decision came less than 24 hours after the latest round of tariffs had come into force, hitting key trade partners, such as Vietnam, which saw its imports facing a new levy of 46%.",
      "The duties, which the president had announced last week, were higher and more far-reaching than many on Wall Street had anticipated.",
      "In the aftermath of the announcement, the S&P plunged more than 10% and many analysts warned of the rising risk of economic recession in the US and globally.",
      "By Wednesday, the fears had hit the bond market, where investors started dumping US government debt.",
      "\"Although President Donald Trump was able to resist the stock market sell-off, once the bond market began to weaken too, it was only a matter of time before he folded,\" said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist for Capital Economics.",
      "He said he expected Trump to return to the plan for a 10% universal tariff that he called for in his presidential campaign last year, though warned that it would take time for for the US and China to work out a deal.",
      "\"It is difficult to see either side backing down in the next few days,\" he said. \"But we suspect that talks will eventually happen, although a full rollback of all the additional tariffs applied since Inauguration Day appear unlikely.\"",

      "Companies such as Nike, which makes roughly half its footwear in Vietnam, jumped 11%, while Apple soared roughly 15%.",
      "Despite the gains on Wednesday, the leading indexes in the US remained lower than they were before Trump's announcement, with the S&P 500 off about 3% and down more than 8% for the year.",
      "The levies on goods from China, America's third largest supplier of imports, remain an economic challenge.",
      "The country sent more than $400bn in goods to the US last year and was the source of an estimated 60% of footwear imports and roughly 36% of clothing imports in January, according to the American Apparel and Footwear Association.",
      "Before Trump's announcement, the National Retail Federation had warned that shipments handled by US ports in May were likely to be 20% lower than a year earlier due to the tariffs.",
      "In appearances after his decision on Wednesday, Trump said that he hoped to strike a deal with China, and was also considering granting exemptions to tariffs for individual companies, a shift from earlier comments.",
      "\"I saw last night where people were getting a little queasy,\" he said, acknowledging the concerns, though he has signalled he remains committed to duties on key strategic sectors, such as cars, steel and aluminium, and is eyeing other industries such as pharmaceuticals and lumber.",
      "His decision to offer a respite from the so-called reciprocal duties followed rising political pressure in Washington and from other influential figures that had backed him during last year's presidential campaign, including Tesla boss Elon Musk, billionaire Bill Ackman and Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy.",
      "But the abrupt climbdown still caught many off-guard.",
      "Almost at the same time as Trump posted his move on social media, Goldman Sachs issued a report predicting a recession in the US economy triggered by the steep duties.",
      "Two hours later, the bank said it was reverting to its earlier forecast, which, even assuming lower tariffs than the president had announced last week, expected minimal growth this year and put the odds of a recession at 45%.",
      "Mr Ackman, who had earlier called for a 90-day tariff pause, praised the president on social media: \"Thank you on behalf of all Americans,\" he said."

      "The rise came after Trump pressed ahead with sweeping tariffs on goods being imported into the US, while Washington's trade war with China escalated further - although Trump on Wednesday did put a 90-day pause on higher tariffs for some countries.",
      "After the US implemented a 104% tariff on products from China at midnight on Wednesday, Beijing hit back with 84% levy on American products. Trump later raised the tariff on China to 125%.",
      "Stock markets have been falling sharply over the past few days in reaction to the escalating global trade war and fears of tariffs leading to higher prices, although US stocks soared when Trump announced the 90-day pause and a lowered 10% reciprocal tariff for other countries.",
      "However, the sale of bonds in the US poses a major problem for the world's biggest economy.",

      "'US recession a coin toss'",
      "JP Morgan, the investment banking giant, has raised the likelihood of a US recession from 40% to 60% and warned that American policy was \"tilting away from growth\".",
      "Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Liberum, told the BBC that the Fed could decide to cut interest rates in a bid to protect US jobs by making it easier for businesses to borrow cash as they face higher costs from tariffs.",
      "He said it was a \"coin toss\" over whether the US would enter a recession.",
      "This is defined as a prolonged and widespread decline in economic activity typically characterised by a jump in unemployment and fall in incomes.",
      "'US sneezes, UK catches a cold'",
      "Mr El Erian said the UK was likely to be impacted by the US bonds sell-off.",
      "\"When US treasuries sneeze, UK government bonds catch a cold - we have seen a significant move up in UK bond yields which means more pressure on the Budget,\" he added.",

    "summary": "An emergency law has handed control of the UK's only remaining plant making virgin steel to the government.",
    "story": [
      "The UK government has taken control of British Steel's plant in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, after it was put at risk of imminent closure.",
      "MPs were called back to Parliament on Saturday from their Easter break to pass an emergency law that handed control of the Chinese-owned site to the government, in order to keep its two blast furnaces operating.",
      "What is British Steel and how many people work there?",
      "British Steel's plant in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, employs 2,700 people, about three-quarters of the company's entire workforce.",
      "It is the last plant in the UK capable of producing virgin steel, which is used in major construction projects like new buildings and railways.",
      "Two huge blast furnaces are used to produce the steel, which has fewer imperfections than the recycled steel made elsewhere in the country.",
      "Were the plant to cease producing virgin steel, the UK would become the only member of the G7 group of leading economies without the ability to make it - a prospect the government views as a risk to the country's long-term economic security.",
      "Who owns British Steel and has it been nationalised?",
      "The company was founded in 2016 when Tata Steel sold its loss-making long products division in Scunthorpe to private investment firm Greybull Capital for a token \u00a31.",
      "The new owners renamed the business British Steel.",
      "Following a period of financial instability, British Steel was taken over by the government's insolvency service in 2019 and then acquired by Chinese steel-making firm Jingye the following year.",
      "In late March 2025, Jingye said the plant was losing around \u00a3700,000 a day and launched a consultation on its closure.",
      "The government held talks with Jingye aimed at keeping the plant operational.",
      "After these appeared to have largely broken down, emergency legislation was fast-tracked through Parliament in a single day on Saturday - handing control of the plant to the government.",
      "Jingye still owns the site, but the business secretary now has sweeping powers to control management and workers to make sure production continues.",
      "This means British Steel has not been nationalised - which is when a government takes ownership and control of a company.",
      "But Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds acknowledged that public ownership was \"the likely option\".",
      "While the government hopes to secure private investment to save the plant, ministers admit there are currently no companies willing to buy it.",
      "Why did the government step in?",
      "The supplies needed to keep the blast furnaces running - coking coal and iron pellets - are running low at the Scunthorpe plant.",
      "This added time pressure to the talks, because once a blast furnace shuts down it is a costly and complex process to restart it.",
      "Unions said the situation was on a \"cliff-edge,\" while the Community Union described the lack of supplies as an \"extreme emergency\".",
      "The government offered to buy the raw materials needed to keep the furnaces running earlier this week, but Jingye did not agree to that proposal.",
      "In the Commons on Saturday, the business secretary said Jingye had wanted \"an excessive amount\" of money.",
      "He said it had become clear during negotiations that the company intended to \"refuse\" to buy enough material to keep the furnaces running, and \"to cancel and refuse to pay for existing orders\".",
      "\"The company would therefore have irrevocably and unilaterally closed down primary steel making at British Steel,\" he added.",
      "The emergency law gives the government the ability to order raw materials to keep the furnaces running, and to direct the company's workforce and board.",
      "The government has told the company's UK management to keep the site operational, and the new law will ensure that any employees who are sacked by the Chinese owners can be reinstated.",
      "Why is the Scunthorpe plant losing money?",
      "Jingye said the blast furnaces were \"no longer financially sustainable,\" blaming \"highly challenging\" market conditions, tariffs and costs associated with transitioning to lower-carbon production techniques.",
      "UK steel production has been falling for several decades and the financial pressures facing the industry were heightened in March when the US imposed a 25% tariff on any steel it imports.",
      "Global over-production of steel has created \"a glut of steel on the international market\", according to a UK government briefing on the industry, which has pushed prices down. British manufacturers also face higher costs, particularly on electricity, than elsewhere.",
      "Who else produces steel in the UK?",
      "There are 1,160 businesses in the UK steel industry, directly supporting 40,000 other firms across the country, according to government figures.",
      "Tata Steel at Port Talbot in Wales was once the UK's largest virgin steel producer but it turned off its blast furnace in September 2024, saying it was losing \u00a31.7m a day.",
      "An agreement with the UK government was reached which saw it commit \u00a3500m to help the company move to greener forms of steelmaking.",
      "Other steelmakers in the UK include Liberty Steel, Celsa, Marcegaglia and Outokumpu.",
      "Liberty Steel also has a plant in Scunthorpe which is facing closure. More than 120 jobs are at risk, with bosses blaming high energy costs.",
      "In 2023 the UK steel industry contributed \u00a32.3 billion to the UK economy -  equivalent to 0.1% of total UK economic output and 1.0% of manufacturing output.",
      "In the same year, the UK produced 5.6 million tonnes of crude steel, or 0.3% of the world's total. In comparison, China produced more than 1,000 million tonnes, 54% of global production.",
      "The EU produced 126 million tonnes of steel in 2023, 7% of the world's total. Compared with EU countries, the UK ranked as the eighth largest steel producer, after Germany, Italy, Spain, France, Austria, Poland and Belgium.",

      "Last month, the Florida-based firm claimed to have successfully tested a tiny data centre the size of a hardback book that hitched a ride to the Moon on the Athena Lunar Lander from US space exploration firm Intuitive Machines. This, in turn, had been launched by a rocket from Elon Musk's SpaceX.",
      "Data centres are the vast warehouses that house stacks of computers that store and process data used by websites, companies and governments.",
      "Lonestar says that putting them on the Moon will offer customers secure, reliable data processing, while taking advantage of unlimited solar energy to power them.",
      "The environmental campaigners fighting against data centres",
      "Data centre power use 'to surge six-fold in 10 years'",
      "Concern UK's AI ambitions could lead to water shortages",
      "And while space-based data centres may sound far-fetched, it's an idea that's really starting to take off.",
      "Part of the reason is rocketing demand and the difficulty of finding suitable sites on Earth.",
      "The ever-expanding use of artificial intelligence (AI) computing has seen a massive increase in the amount of data that needs to be stored and processed around the world.",
      "As a result, the need for data centres has shot up too, with annual demand set to rise between 19% and 22% by 2030, according to global management consultants McKinsey.",
      "New facilities are springing up all the time - but it's getting hard to find places to put them. Data centres are large and sprawling, and use enormous amounts of power and water for cooling.",
      "And increasingly local people don't want them built nearby.",
      "Putting data centres in space \u2013 either in orbit around Earth, or on the Moon - the theory goes, means they can't do quite so much harm. There's more-or-less unlimited energy available from the sun, for example, and no neighbours to complain about the environmental impacts.",
      "Not only that, space-based data centres could specialise in services for spacecraft and other space facilities, with space-to-space data transfers quicker than from the ground.",
      "Last summer, a European Commission-funded feasibility study into orbiting data centres published its results.",
      "The Ascend report by carried out by Thales Alenia Space - a joint venture between French and Italian aerospace groups Thales and Leonardo - published its results.",
      "It determined that deploying data centres in space \"could transform the European digital landscape\", and be \"more eco-friendly\".",
      "Thales Alenia Space envisages building a constellation of 13 satellites measuring  a combined 200m-by-80m, and with a total data processing power of around 10 megawatts (MW). That's equivalent to a current medium-sized, ground-based data centre, with some 5,000 servers.",
      "Based on technologies that already exist or are under development, the satellites would be assembled in orbit.",
      "Damien Dumestier, Ascend project architect at Thales Alenia Space, says that for space-based data centres to be more environmentally friendly than existing ground-based ones it will be necessary to make the rocket launchers 10 times less emissive over their lifecycles. He says this looks possible.",
      "\"But in order to cover the new technology's developments and the production capacity ramp-up to benefit from scale, we have to consider larger system capacity, around 200MW, meaning 200 of our envisaged large space infrastructures and 200 launches,\" he says.",
      "\"The main question is when an adapted launcher will be ready. Depending on the investment and decisions to be taken, this could be done for 2030 or 2035, meaning commercial viability before 2037.\"",
      "However, despite this optimism from firms aiming to develop the technology, Dr Domenico Vicinanza, associate professor of intelligent systems and data science at Anglia Ruskin University in the UK, says there are numerous big hurdles before space-based data centres can be a viable proposition.",
      "\"Even with the contribution and advancements of companies like SpaceX, launching hardware into orbit remains extremely expensive,\" he says. \"Each kilogram sent into space costs thousands of dollars.",
      "\"Space-based data centres would require not only the data equipment but also the infrastructure to protect, power, and cool them. All of which add up in weight and complexity.\"",
      "Cooling the equipment will be a particular problem,  because even though space is cold, conventional cooling systems don't work well without gravity.",
      "Meanwhile, space weather can damage electronics, while the ever-increasing quantity of space debris puts the physical hardware at risk.",
      "Dr Vicinanza adds: \"And fixing problems in orbit is far from straightforward. Even with robotics and automation, there are limits to what can be repaired remotely.",
      "\"A big hardware failure might necessitate a costly human mission, potentially making downtime stretch for weeks or months.\"",
      "Yet firms like Lonestar are supremely confident, and say that they are responding to demand. \"We wouldn't be doing this if the customers weren't asking us to,\" says Mr Scott.",
      "Its next target is to put a small data centre in orbit around the moon in 2027. Meanwhile, other companies are hoping to get there a bit faster, such as Washington state-based Starcloud, which is due to launch a satellite-based data centre next month, and start commercial operations in mid-2026.",
      "Lonestar's Mr Eidele says that space-based facilities offer more security for governments and businesses because their data does not need to be routed through terrestrial networks. Instead the information can be beamed directly from space to a dedicated ground station.",
      "\"It's like having the vaults at the back of the bank,\" he says. \"You don't have to open it every day, but it's there to provide an extra measure of security, and the distance from the Earth to the moon offers that - it's that much harder to hack, that much harder to access.\"",
      "The distance to the Moon means that data takes about a second and a half to reach the ground - this doesn't matter for some applications, like longer-term data storage and backups.",
      "And meanwhile, says Lonestar founder and chief executive Chris Stott, space-based data centres can help organisations meet regulations about data sovereignty - the need to hold peoples' data in the country of origin.",

      "The app, called Maple Scan, is one of numerous emerging in Canada to help people shop local. Others include Buy Canadian, Is This Canadian? and Shop Canadian.",
      "Maple Scan's founder, Sasha Ivanov, says his app has had 100,000 downloads since it launched last month. He believes the momentum around buying Canadian is here to stay.",
      "\"Lots of Canadians have told me, 'I'm not going back'. It's important that we support local regardless,\" he says.",

      "Meanwhile, other European Union exports will get tariffs of 20%, while the UK is facing 10%.",
      "Trump says the tariffs will boost US manufacturing, raise tax revenue and reduce the US trade deficit. However, they have spooked global markets, which have fallen sharply over the past month.",
      "Trump has even expressed a desire for Canada to join the US as its 51st state, something the Canadian government was quick to strongly reject.",
      "Ottawa has also responded with C$60bn ($42bn; \u00a332bn) in counter tariffs, as well as additional tariffs on the US auto sector.",
      "And there has been a substantial drop in the number of Canadians travelling to the US.",

      "Douglas Irwin, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College in the US, who specializes in the history of US trade policy, believes the economic impact of the boycott may be limited. \"It is hard to judge how economically significant the consumer boycotts will be in terms of reducing trade with the United States,\" he says.",

Ryan Christiansen, Caledonia's president and head distiller, says his business had an order on track for shipment to Quebec cancelled directly after tariffs were announced.",

      "Hong Fu is the world's second-biggest maker of trainers (sneakers) supplying shoes to Nike, Converse, Adidas, Puma and many others. It makes around 200 million pairs of sports shoes a year.",
      "So when it made a big investment in India's market, the footwear industry took note.",
      "Hong Fu is currently building a giant plant in Panapakkam, in the state of Tamil Nadu in south eastern India. When fully operational, some time in the next three to five years, it will make 25 million pairs of shoes a year, employing as many as 25,000 workers.",
      "The project has Indian partners, including Aqeel Panaruna, the chairman of Florence Shoe Company: \"The international market is saturated and they [Hong Fu] were looking for a new market,\" he explains.",
      "\"There is a drastic increase in non-leather footwear in India. It has huge potential,\" Mr Panaruna added.",
      "The Indian government is keen to attract such investment, hoping it will raise standards in the footwear industry and boost exports.",
      "To spur the industry, last August the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) introduced new quality rules for all shoes sold in India.",
      "Under those standards, for example, materials will have to pass tests of strength and flexibility.",
      "\"These BIS standards are really about cleaning up the market. We've had too many low-quality products flooding in, and consumers deserve better,\" says Sandeep Sharma a journalist and footwear industry expert.",

      "\"Many organised brands struggle to expand their retail footprint in semi-urban and rural areas because we cater to them.\"",
      "So how will the new government standards affect makers like Ashok?",
      "\"It's complicated,\" says Mr Sharma.",
      "\"I think the government is trying to walk a tightrope here. They can't just shut down thousands of small businesses that employ millions of people - that would be economic suicide.",
      "\"What I'm seeing is more of a carrot-and-stick approach. They're pushing for standards, but also rolling out programs to help small manufacturers upgrade their processes. It's not about wiping out the unorganised sector but gradually bringing them into the fold.\"",
      "Making the situation more complicated is that the unorganised sector is well-known for making counterfeit shoes of big brands.",
      "While popular among Indian shoppers looking for a stylish bargain, other countries have long-complained about the losses caused.",

      "Mr Agrawal says his company, Zen Barefoot, is unusual as much of the Indian footwear industry is not very innovative.",
      "\"There are very few people who are ready to take time and invest in new technologies here. Indian manufacturing is a very profit- first market, ROI [return on investment] driven.",
      "\"And in a lot of cases, even the government is not ready to enable these industries through grants or tax relief, which makes it quite difficult.\"",

      "\"Most homegrown brands rely on off-the-shelf soles from the market, but when we started Comet, we realized that these were lacking in quality, durability, and grip,\" he says.",
      "Change is coming to the footwear sector he says. \"The shift to high value is now happening.\"",
      "\"Many high value brands need to move their manufacturing to India. In 3-5 years, we should have a robust ecosystem to compete in the international sneaker market,\" he adds.",
      "Back in Agra, Ashok hopes that the unorganised sector is not neglected amid the growth of India's footwear industry.",
      "\"The government should give us accreditation and certificates so our factories don't close down. Once we too are included in the organised sector no one can beat India in the shoe manufacturing industry.\"",
      "But Mr Sharma says change is inevitable.",
      "\"The market is definitely going to shift. We'll see the bigger players getting bigger - they have the money to adapt quickly.",

      "The economic uncertainty caused by US President Donald Trump's trade tariffs may mean UK interest rates fall further than expected.",
      "When the Bank of England held interest rates at 4.5% at its last meeting in March, most analysts thought it would cut twice in 2025, but many now anticipate four cuts will take rates down to 3.5%.",

      "What are interest rates and why do they change?",
      "An interest rate tells you how much it costs to borrow money, or the reward for saving it.",
      "The Bank of England's base rate is what it charges other lenders to borrow money.",
      "This influences what lenders then charge their customers for loans such as mortgages, as well as the interest rate they pay on savings accounts.",
      "The Bank moves rates up and down in order to control UK inflation - which is the increase in the price of something over time.",
      "It has a target to keep inflation at 2%.",
      "When inflation is high, it may decide to raise rates to bring inflation back down.",
      "The idea is to encourage people to spend less and reduce demand.",
      "Once inflation is at or near the target, the Bank may hold rates, or cut them.",
      "What has happened to UK interest rates and will they go down further?",
      "It is difficult to predict exactly what will happen to interest rates. The Bank has to consider whether inflation remains at or below its target, and how the UK economy is doing more generally.",
      "It also pays close attention to the performance of the global economy, which has been thrown into chaos by US tariffs.",
      "The main inflation measure, CPI, was 2.8% in the 12 months to February 2025, down slightly from the previous month.",
      "Although that is far below the peak of 11.1% reached in October 2022, it remains above the 2% target.",
      "After many months of keeping interest rates at a 16-year high of 5.25%, the Bank of England cut them to 5% in August 2024, and again to 4.75% in November. Rates fell again to 4.5% in February, where they stayed in March.",
      "When the Bank cut rates in February, it also cut its growth forecast for the UK economy in 2025.",
      "It said it expected the UK to only narrowly avoid falling into recession - where the economy shrinks for two three-month periods in a row - and predicted that inflation would rise towards 4% later in 2025.",
      "Announcing the decision to hold rates in March, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey warned about global economic uncertainty but said that he still believed interest rates were on a \"gradually declining path\".",
      "The Bank was concerned about the possible impacts of increases to the amount of National Insurance paid by employers and the minimum wage, both of which took effect at the start of April.",
      "There are growing fears that the US tariffs could spark a full-blown international trade war, push up prices and fuel inflation around the world - including in the UK.",
      "If that happens and the economy suffers, the Bank may may feel it has to cut rates further than it had planned to do at the start of the year.",

    "summary": "The way the boy was held on the floor in a special school was unlawful, a use-of-force expert tells BBC.",
    "story": [
      "CCTV of an autistic pupil being restrained by staff in a seclusion room at a special school is \"brutal\" and \"unlawful\", a restraint expert has told the BBC.",
      "The footage shows the 12-year-old being held face-down on the floor in a prone restraint involving five members of staff.",
      "His mother, who gave it to the BBC, said she was \"horrified\" when she watched it.",
      "The management of the school, in Leeds, said multiple investigations found staff had no case to answer and the expert views were a \"difference of opinion\".",
      "The BBC has also spoken to an autistic pupil who was aged five when he was detained for prolonged periods at a different school.",
      "The BBC's investigation into seclusion - facilities known variously as calming, quiet or safe rooms - began last year when we uncovered CCTV of non-verbal pupils being abused and neglected at Whitefield School in north London.",
      "A spokesperson for the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer described those failings as \"horrendous\" and said they \"must never happen again\".",
      "Now, we have separately learned of concerns about the use of such rooms elsewhere, including footage recorded in October 2023 at Springwell Leeds Academy North site - a school for pupils with social, emotional and mental health special needs.",
      "The CCTV includes one 50-minute video in which an 12-year-old autistic pupil is repeatedly restrained by staff and shown trying to kick them.",
      "Near the end of the footage, the child swings his arm at staff and is then manoeuvred to the floor. He is then held in a prone restraint for three minutes.",
      "Eric Baskind, an expert on the use of force in institutional settings who has reviewed the footage, said the restraint is \"too brutal, unnecessary and, in my view, unlawful\" - an opinion endorsed by a second expert asked to review the footage by the BBC.",
      "Mr Baskind said the force was unreasonable as staff members already had control of the boy and could have moved him into a sitting position on the bench instead.",
      "\"They just dragged him [into the prone position],\" he said. \"That would have been really traumatic, and it would have escalated the hostility in the situation, which is the exact opposite of what they ought to have been trying to do.\"",
      "A third expert, education consultant Elizabeth Swan, said the use of force was \"unreasonable, excessive and unnecessarily prolonged\".",
      "She also said the room resembled a \"holding cell\" and many autistic children find being deprived of sensory stimulation traumatising.",
      "The boy's mother, Zoe, requested the footage from the school through an application for his personal information known as a subject access request, and later shared it with the BBC.",
      "\"This is a child and these are five grown adults in a school where he's supposed to be safe,\" she said.",
      "\"A calming room should be a room for children to calm down with blankets, teddies and soft lighting. Not a padded cell. You wouldn't put an animal in there.\"",
      "In response, Wellspring Academy Trust's chief executive, Mark Wilson, told the BBC that it had conducted three investigations into the footage and found no case to answer against staff.",
      "He also said that an investigation by Leeds City Council's local authority designated officer - responsible for managing allegations against adults who work with children - had found that malpractice was unsubstantiated.",
      "In a further statement, Mr Wilson said the incident was typical of those that happen in schools \"from time to time\" and this \"difference of opinion\" concerned footage which was \"selective\", lacking context and sound, and misrepresentative of staff care. He also said the school was rated \"good\" by Ofsted.\u00ad",
      "Although the door to the room at the Leeds school was open, the BBC's investigation into seclusion has revealed that pupils are also sometimes locked in rooms elsewhere. Zip up tents have also been used - and even, in one instance, a cage.",
      "We have spoken to an eight-year-old autistic pupil who was repeatedly locked inside seclusion rooms at a different school while aged five.",
      "The boy - whose identity we have protected - told the BBC that being sent there was \"horrible\" and left him feeling angry and worried.",
      "\"It was just very scary because they can put me in there for as long as they want,\" he said.",
      "Our initial investigation into Whitefield School in London showed pupils being pushed into rooms with Rhino pads - that are often used in rugby training - and also being thrown to the floor and left sitting in vomit, before its calming rooms were shut in 2017.",
      "However, no rules have been changed and schools in the UK are not legally required to tell parents when they place their child in seclusion.",
      "In 2021, 550 hours of CCTV were handed to the Metropolitan Police after it had been discovered by new leadership at Whitefield School - but the force's investigation into staff concluded last year without anyone being charged.",
      "Now the BBC has learned that the local authority where the school is based, Waltham Forest, was warned that calming rooms were being over-used at Whitefield the year before they were shut down following an Ofsted inspection - but it failed to act.",
      "A charity, the British Institute of Learning Disabilities, visited the school and warned of the harms of seclusion. Waltham Forest did not comment when approached by the BBC.",
      "The Education Secretary, Bridget Phillipson, has repeatedly declined to be interviewed about the lack of regulation of calming rooms.",
      "In response to our latest findings, the government said a consultation is under way about use of force and restrictive interventions - and it is awaiting the findings of a Waltham Forest investigation.",
      "Draft guidance asks schools to have a policy on seclusion but this will not be a legal requirement.",
      "Meanwhile, the families of Whitefield pupils have now formed a campaign group that is calling on the government to act.",
      "Maria - the parent of one of the 39 affected Whitefield pupils - said ministers \"have seen the footage and said 'this can't happen again' - and yet there's no change.\"",
      "\"Anything that happens to any other child or young person since they said that is on them - as their inaction makes them culpable.\"",
      "Maria said footage of her son in the Whitefield calming rooms was the \"most degrading, dehumanising and undignified video\" she had ever seen.",
      "Gemma Grant, of the Challenging Behaviour Foundation charity, said school staff face enormous challenges but seclusion rooms are \"outdated and inhumane\" and should be banned.",
      "While schools will legally be required to report use of force to parents in England from September, there will still be no statutory requirement to tell them about the use of seclusion, despite it being \"really clear it's causing harm to children\", according to Mrs Grant.",
      "In Scotland, guidance already advises that schools report seclusion to parents as soon as possible, but it is not a legal requirement. In Northern Ireland, statutory guidance on seclusion is being developed, while in Wales schools are asked to obtain parental consent.",

      "\"These children are not spending these hours on their phones while sat in school,\" Dame Rachel said in a new report.",
      "She said schools should educate young people about online risks - but parents and carers needed more help to manage their children's online habits and technology companies must \"take responsibility for making the online world safe\".",
      "She added that she would back any head teacher's decision to ban phones, but added: \"It should always be their choice, based on their knowledge of what's best for the children in their own classrooms, not a direction imposed nationally by the government.\"",

      "It looks like a simple, repetitive game, but is actually a test of a fundamental skill that is developing in the toddler's growing brain. Henry is wearing a sensor-laden cap with wires emerging from it that are attached to a large piece of analytical machinery. While Henry plays the game, the cap is scanning his brain activity and building up a picture of how well he can control his decision making.",
      "It is a test of inhibitory control, one of the skills scientists at the University of Bristol are measuring in babies and toddlers, as part of a mission to understand how and when very young children develop abilities that enable them to focus and learn.",
      "Scientists already know these skills are critical - but they don't yet know at what point they are established in an infant brain.",
      "The development of hundreds of children - from the age of six months to five years - is being tracked as they form the key skills that will shape their academic and social abilities.",
      "But what is really special about this pioneering project is that it is a human experiment within another decades-long human experiment. The mothers of 300 of the children being studied are themselves part of a project that has monitored their health since they too were babies, in the 1990s.",
      "A lifetime of data is being gathered that could reveal links between the brain development of the children being studied now and the health, experiences and genetics of their parents.",
      "For a study of child development, already having all this rich information about the parents is \"completely unique in the world\", lead researcher Dr Karla Holmboe says.",
      "\"We need to know when different skills develop and we need to understand how individual children develop over time.\"",
      "Children who are struggling when they start school tend to continue to struggle, Dr Holmboe explains.",
      "\"That can even continue into adulthood. So, there's this whole period of development that we need to understand so we can support children at a much younger age.\"",
      "During the study, young participants and their parents are invited to the university psychology lab to play scientific games and have their brain activity measured. Many have MRI scans at the ages of six months, three years and five years, generating a true picture of their young, developing brains.",
      "Key to the smiley face game Henry is playing is where that face appears on the iPad screen. Just as the toddler gets used to the face repeatedly popping up on the right side of his screen, it randomly starts appearing on the other side too.",
      "\"We're seeing if Henry can resist the urge to just keep tapping on the right,\" explains research assistant Carmel Brough, \"and instead look for where the smiley face is.\"",
      "This skill, explains Dr Holmboe, is critical when children start school.",
      "\"In a classroom, a child needs to be able to focus and not let their attention drift,\" she says. \"To learn new things, we need to be able to stop old habits.\"",
      "In another room, Jaxon, who is also aged two, is playing a game designed to test his working memory.",
      "A research assistant encourages him to watch as she puts stickers in different pots. The toddler is then asked to recall which pots contain stickers, and which do not. The motivating factor? Jaxon can keep all the stickers he finds.",
      "\"Working memory is when we need to keep a little bit of information in our head to solve a problem or do a task - like a puzzle, or even just remembering where we put something two minutes ago,\" explains Dr Holmboe. \"For children, you can imagine we need these skills when we learn maths or learn to read.",

      "The project's data has been made available to scientists around the world and has been cited in thousands of scientific papers.",
      "One study of the diets of children of the 90s provided evidence that, while a child's fussy eating is often worrying, it is unlikely to have any lasting impact on their health and development.",
      "Thanks to repeated health-screenings that have been key to the project, it also revealed that one in five young people shows signs of fatty liver disease, and one in 40 young people may have liver scarring - caused largely by obesity and alcohol consumption. This has shown just how common the condition is and provided insights into ways it can be prevented through diet.",
      "And the scientific revelations keep on coming. Last month, the study revealed that children who lacked oily fish in their diets were less sociable and kind.",
      "In this latest study \u2013 of the children of the children of the 90s \u2013 scientists are looking specifically at formative abilities and brain development. They will follow each child until they start school.",

      "In an exclusive interview, Katie Wheeler and John Meehan told the BBC that life without Genevieve was \"unbearable\".",
      "When she sent her daughter to nursery, she \"never in a million years thought that anything like this would happen\", says Ms Wheeler.",
      "The couple have described as \"horrifying\", figures obtained by the BBC that show there were almost 20,000 reports of serious childcare incidents in England's nurseries in the past five years.",
      "That is an average of about 75 \"significant events\" reported to Ofsted each week - including incidents of serious injury or significant harm. There have even been rare cases involving deaths.",
      "The latest figures for serious incidents in the year 2023-24 are 40% higher than five years previously.",
      "Ofsted - which inspects England's education providers - says the rise may, in part, be due to its increased efforts to ensure nurseries report such events.",
      "Industry body, the Early Years Alliance, says most providers prioritise safety and that safeguarding breaches are extremely rare.",
      "Ms Wheeler and Mr Meehan are now calling for more frequent Ofsted inspections and for CCTV footage to be checked by inspectors.",
      "Genevieve had been at the now-closed Tiny Toes nursery in Stockport, Greater Manchester, for a week when she died.",
      "CCTV footage showed her struggling and coughing, but nursery worker Kate Roughley did not check on her properly until she was \"unresponsive and blue\", her trial heard. Roughley received a 14-year prison sentence for manslaughter in May last year.",
      "\"I couldn't understand how a baby of this age could go to sleep for a nap in the afternoon and then not wake up,\" Ms Wheeler told us.",
      "\"I completely lost who I was, that night in hospital, holding her.\"",
      "Nurseries made more than 4,200 reports of serious childcare incidents in 2023-24, the BBC has found, compared with 3,021 in 2019-20 - according to Ofsted figures, obtained through a Freedom of Information request.",
      "Ofsted - which regulates more than 27,000 non-domestic childcare settings in England - says these were reports it had assessed as urgent.",
      "Incidents could range from injuries or illnesses, to serious accidents and deaths. They also include events affecting nursery premises, such as fires or floods.",
      "Ofsted's broad criteria for reporting can mean nursery workers \"err on the side of caution\", the Early Years Alliance says - meaning investigations often find no safeguarding breach has, in fact, occurred.",
      "But a childcare expert says the rise in the number of reports highlights a \"dire situation\".",
      "\"Standards [of care] are so low that the government surely has an obligation to improve them,\" says Helen Penn, professor of early childhood from the University of East London.",
      "Parents often rely on Ofsted's inspections and subsequent ratings to help them choose the best childcare setting.",
      "Full inspections usually happen every six years, but the regulator can inspect more often if a nursery is graded as inadequate or requiring improvement - or if concerns are raised.",
      "Schools rated good or outstanding are usually inspected every four years - and more frequently if graded lower.",
      "More than 1,500 nursery inspections had been brought forward after receiving reports of serious childcare incidents - Ofsted told us.",
      "But a former Ofsted inspector told us the regulator is not conducting enough inspections to identify poor practice and protect children.",
      "The ex-inspector, who did not want to be named, says inspections are a \"tick box exercise\" which are \"very easy to manipulate\".",
      "\"As long as they can say: 'We've asked all these questions, what more can we do?' But you do that once every so many years - how is that safeguarding the children?\" she says.",
      "Details of organisations offering support with child bereavement are available at BBC Action Line",
      "Details of organisations offering support with child bereavement are available at BBC Action Line",
      "The BBC has spoken to more than 20 former and current nursery workers, all from different premises across England, who said they had witnessed poor care.",
      "Many said frequent short-staffing was a factor in children being put at risk - and that Ofsted inspectors were not always able to spot this.",
      "Until 2015, inspectors would arrive at nurseries unannounced - but only a third of inspections are now carried out this way. Most nurseries are informed the day before.",
      "The notice period is used by some nurseries to deliberately mislead inspectors, some nursery workers told us. Managers ask friends or family to attend, they say, to make a nursery appear fully staffed.",
      "One former worker said 15 babies had been left sleeping in a room with only a baby monitor and no staff members to look after them. But when Ofsted announced an inspection, managers called in staff from other locations.",
      "The ex-Ofsted inspector says she witnessed workers man-handling children during inspections. \"If you can do that in front of someone, what are you planning on doing if nobody is watching?\" she adds.",
      "Misleading inspections is an \"appalling practice\", says Yvette Stanley, Ofsted's Head of Early Years and Social Care - adding that inspectors have to rely on the \"integrity of providers\".",
      "As police reviewed nursery CCTV as part of their investigation into Genevieve's death, it revealed a second staff member had also been causing harm to children.",
      "Rebecca Gregory was jailed for three years last September after being convicted of the wilful neglect and ill-treatment of children, including threatening and pushing babies younger than one.",
      "Ofsted inspectors do not routinely check CCTV footage - and the regulator says it cannot mandate CCTV use in nurseries.",
      "There is no government guidance on checking footage during inspections and it does not have the resources to do this, it adds.",
      "The former owners of Tiny Toes in Stockport say they cannot comment because of an ongoing investigation by Stockport Council.",
      "Local authorities are responsible for investigating any safeguarding concerns at nurseries.",
      "In light of our findings from Ofsted about a broad range of incidents, we asked councils across England about the specific number of times harm had been caused to children by nursery workers.",
      "Seventy-two out of more than 150 councils responded to Freedom of Information requests with figures indicating there had been 5,795 reports or allegations of children being harmed by nursery workers, over a five-year period between 2019 and 2024.",
      "There were like-for-like figures from 36 councils for both that period and the five years up to 2015, when Ofsted stopped routine no-notice inspections.",
      "Reports of harm to young children almost tripled over that time - from 1,303 between 2010-15, to 3,342 between 2019-24. These figures may include cases where the incident was either accidental or unproven.",
      "Standards of care are low and if something does not change there will be \"more accidents, more harm to babies, more unhappy parents and children,\" says early childhood professor Helen Penn.",
      "Ofsted says it is giving \"conspicuous care and monitoring\" to reports of harm to children.",
      "More frequent inspections may be a solution, says Ofsted's Yvette Stanley, but she says the regulator does not currently have the resources available to do this.",
      "\"We think we do enough no-notice inspections to reassure ourselves in the cases where the data is worrying,\" she adds.",
      "The Early Years Alliance added that children's safety should \"never be compromised\" and it welcomed any action which strengthens this.",
      "The Department for Education (DfE) has said it will introduce stronger safeguarding measures in early years settings in September, including \"enhanced recruitment practices\" intended to prevent unsuitable people from working with children.",
      "A spokesperson said the department will \"continue to closely monitor whether any further changes to safeguarding requirements are needed in early years to keep children as safe as possible\"."

    "summary": "A planned UK version of the legendary US comedy show is described as a \"difficult proposition\".",
    "story": [
      "US TV institution Saturday Night Live has entertained viewers and created comedy stars for 50 years. Can a British version reach the same heights?",
      "For five decades, the phrase \"Live from New York, it's Saturday night!\" has boldly opened episodes of Saturday Night Live, with its tried and tested mix of topical sketch comedy, celebrity cameos and big-name musical guests.",
      "Now, the stateside staple is to come live from London after Sky announced that a \"star-studded\" UK spin-off, fronted by British comedic talent, will launch next year.",
      "Overseen by the US original show's creator Lorne Michaels, now 80, the broadcaster is promising the same \"live, fast-paced style\" as its American cousin.",
      "Comedy heritage",
      "Since being launched by Michaels in 1975, SNL has been a livewire springboard for comedic talents like Bill Murray, Eddie Murphy, Tina Fey, Will Ferrell and Mike Myers.",
      "Famed for its ever-revolving cast, Joe Piscopo of the 1980s cohort summed it up in a documentary marking the show's 50th anniversary: \"They took sketch comedy to a whole other level,\" he said. \"Comedy slowly became rock 'n' roll.\"",
      "The unpredictable live premise, combined with its longevity, has helped maintain its status. No other show has been nominated for (331) or won (90) more Emmy Awards.",
      "\"I don't think you can underestimate that heritage when accounting for its current success,\" says the Guardian's TV and comedy writer Rachel Aroesti. \"Which is something the UK version obviously won't be able to emulate.\"",
      "The heritage is one reason why the show still attracts major young stars like Timothee Chalamet, who grew up watching it even as linear TV audiences have dropped sharply in the streaming age.",
      "\"In the US, the guests' involvement is often newsworthy in itself - they also know their presence will generate a lot of publicity, so it's a win-win situation,\" Aroesti adds.",
      "\"I would be surprised if the UK version is able to attract the same calibre of guest.\"",
      "'Courageous' move",
      "The Atlantic writer Helen Lewis says the general industry reaction has been that commissioning a UK version is a \"courageous\" move - wishing the team luck with the \"difficult proposition\".",
      "There are some notable differences between the two transatlantic TV industries.",
      "The US SNL budget will be far bigger than UK TV norm, paying for a large cast and a team of writers working to the wire to keep jokes current.",
      "\"In the American version, it's a very expensive format, having a writers' room and keeping a cast of actors on retainer, essentially, the whole time. That's really expensive,\" Lewis told BBC Radio 4's PM programme.",
      "The US comedy culture is also different, Lewis believes.",
      "\"The humour can sometimes be much more slapsticky. Quite a lot of the time, Americans struggle with British humour because they think we're extremely mean.\"",
      "Comedy writer Jack Bernhardt agrees that there are different comedic traditions. UK sketch groups often form through friendships and showcase their talent at the Edinburgh Fringe, whereas many US comedians train at improv and sketch clubs, specifically honing their skills for shows like SNL.",
      "Bernhardt says these differences \"can't necessarily be fixed by commissioning the UK version of SNL - it's an entire comedy culture that would need to shift\".",
      "\"That's not to say one can't do the other,\" he adds. \"Just that this version of a sketch show isn't necessarily playing to the unique strengths of the UK comedy scene. And that's even before we get into the difficulties of doing a live show.\"",
      "Given these challenges, importing a legacy brand name like SNL may seem a gamble, especially at a time when the UK TV industry is faltering.",
      "However, the US show's fortunes have held relatively firm this decade, even if ratings are well below the pre-streaming era.",
      "Vulture found that SNL averages 8.4 million weekly viewers, outperforming all other late-night shows combined. It's also US network TV's top entertainment series among adults aged 18 to 49.",
      "\"You rarely hear anyone asking whether SNL will 'survive', only how once Michaels moves on,\" wrote reporter Josef Adalian. \"Linear TV may be fighting for its life, yet SNL seems safe.\"",
      "Crucially, the sketch format lends itself perfectly to social media age, being easily digestible on digital platforms. According to the Economist, online SNL clips are averaging about 216 million views per episode on TikTok, X and YouTube. Sure, these viewers are not watching live, but the content undoubtedly lives.",
      "Previous attempts to translate US late-night shows to the UK have often struggled.",
      "However, in the 1980s, Saturday Live - later renamed Friday Night Live - ran for four seasons and helped the careers of Ben Elton, Harry Enfield, Stephen Fry and Rik Mayall, while Channel 4's The 11 O'Clock Show gave breaks to Ricky Gervais and Sacha Baron Cohen.",
      "British comedy producer Jimmy Mulville, whose company Hat Trick Productions has made shows including Have I Got News For You and Whose Line is it Anyway?, says the opportunity to develop new talent will be one of the key draws for Sky, despite the risks.",
      "\"If Sky get this right, they'll create new stars, and from that they can spin-off other shows with those performers,\" he explains. \"These shows can be fantastic, they can go on for years, and they can show off new talent all the time.\"",
      "He says the producers will need to assemble the right team of writers and performers.",
      "\"If it's well-produced, I've no reason to see why it shouldn't be successful,\" says Mulville, who co-hosts Insiders: The TV Podcast.",
      "He recently took the BBC's long-running topical panel show Have I Got News For You to the US, where it has been commissioned for a second season by CNN. One US talent agent warned that the show was \"too British\" to work across the pond, he recalls.",
      "\"I said, 'Yes it is, but I'm going to get it written by Americans and performed by Americans for Americans'.\"",
      "The reverse will be true for SNL. \"In the UK, you're going to have it written by British writers with British performers for a British audience. So it's not an American show any more.\"",
      "Indeed, being \"live from London\" won't be enough on its own to succeed, and SNL UK will need to feel like a truly British comedy creation and not just a reheated imitation of an American hit.",

      "After going back into the main house, Hughes told him Siwa \"was very upset earlier\", and she informed Rourke it was \"not an acceptable word\".",
      "He told her: \"I want to apologise. I've got a habit of having a short fuse. And I don't mean nothing by it. I do mean it [sorry]. If I didn't, I wouldn't say it to you.\"",

    "summary": "Imagination should have no limit when drawing up new resorts, rollercoaster and theme park experts say.",
    "story": [
      "A new Universal theme park near Bedford - the first in Europe - was announced to much fanfare earlier this week.",
      "Set to open in 2031, construction is to begin at the 476-acre (1.9-sq-km) site, where attractions are likely to feature James Bond, Paddington and The Lord of the Rings.",
      "But from deciding how many loops to include on a coaster, to making sure even the trees blend in seamlessly with an area's design, building a dream world is a painstaking task.",
      "To find out what planning lies behind the thrills, and what sort of things we could expect when the new Universal park finally arrives, BBC News spoke to some rollercoaster experts.",
      "Building an iconic rollercoaster",
      "Of course, any good theme park needs some good rides - but maybe it's an understatement to say that's a tall order.",
      "While \"at least two or three iconic rides\" are needed, these need not necessarily be the fastest, tallest or most innovative to stand out, explains Andy Sinclair-Harris, creative director at Katapult, which has designed attractions for the likes of Legoland and Alton Towers.",
      "\"What is more important is the depth of storytelling,\" he says, so that you're fully immersed in the experience of the ride.",
      "A good example, says Robbie Jones, insights director at Katapult, is a Harry-Potter-themed rollercoaster called Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure, located at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Universal's Orlando resort. Riders sit in replicas of Hagrid's motorbike and zoom through recreations of settings from the popular film series.",
      "\"There's nothing particularly brand new or absolutely amazing about that ride, other than it tells a story amazingly well,\" he adds.",
      "How Universal Studios almost came to Essex",
      "Bond and Paddington could star at Universal park",
      "If the rumours that there's going to be a Back to the Future ride at Universal's UK venture are true, those behind it will be ensuring that the DeLorean time machine is included, he says.",
      "During the brainstorming stage of building a resort, rides are often \"developed as storytelling tools\" in a \"specific genre or world\", says Joseph Bright, CEO at Scruffy Dog, which provides creative project management for theme parks.",
      "While an iconic ride might help to \"anchor\" a zone of a park, \"it's never developed in isolation\" - rather \"cohesion is critical [and] every element... must serve the wider guest story\".",
      "Dennis Speigel, founder of International Theme Park Services, says meticulous planning goes into the most immersive rides.",
      "He adds that the size of a rollercoaster is partly dictated by the number of guests its designers hope to get on board - \"between 1,500 and 2,000 an hour\" at popular parks.",
      "Usually, that means a coaster that is over 3,000ft (914m) long, with the first dip \"somewhere in the 150ft (45m) range\".",
      "Mr Speigel says that while an upcoming coaster at Six Flags Qiddiya in Saudi Arabia is set to break records when it sends riders speeding at over 150mph (240 km/h) around the tracks, most coasters today reach between 70-90mph (110-145 km/h) on their first drop.",
      "Once the larger rides are planned out, theme park designers then consider what he describes as \"flat rides\", which cater to less thrill-seeking crowds.",
      "\"Those are your smaller rides that take people around and around, like a merry-go-round or a monster,\" he says. \"[They're] rides that can often be bought off the shelf from a manufacturer.\"",
      "Your route to the ride is key",
      "When you step foot in a theme park, you're probably thinking about the rides you'll be going on - but you might think less about how you get there.",
      "During the design phase, you have to let your imagination run wild, says Mr Sinclair-Harris. \"Budget is a thing, but when you have those first initial discussions, you shouldn't be tempered by anything,\" he says.",
      "The \"story\" of your park is crucial, he adds. \"It's knowing the story, the characters and being true to that world.\"",
      "Discussions about potential ride dimensions and manufacturers soon follow, as well as a masterplan, which configures how attractions, pathways and amenities all fit into the space. It often determines how long people will end up queuing for.",
      "An artist's conception of the Universal UK park depicts a huge lake in middle of what appears to be different themed areas. Far from just looking pretty, it can allow crowds to fan out to multiple rides without congestion forming around one.",
      "Alton Towers has a lake too. Theme park vlogger and fanatic Charlotte Branford - known as Diary of a RollerCoaster Girl - believes it means other visitors often choose to go left around it (to the Wicker Man ride), or right around it (towards the Smiler).

      "These reminders can range from having to face medical appointments with no available interpreter to being excluded from important decisions about your own life, he says.",
      "\"All those things add up over time and generate a sense of injustice,\" Mager says, adding that artist Christine Sun Kim describes this feeling as \"deaf rage\".",
      "It is a feeling partly borne out of the frustration and isolation of living in a hearing-centred world.",
      "This rage, alongside a love of 70s thrillers, is what inspired Mager's new drama.",
      "The bilingual thriller features both British Sign Language (BSL), with subtitles, and spoken English. The majority of the cast in Reunion are deaf or use BSL in their roles.",
      "The four-part series, from the producers of Adolescence, tells the story of Daniel Brennan (Matthew Gurney), a deaf man on a journey of revenge after spending a decade in prison.",
      "Mager, a lifelong fan of 70s thrillers, says he wanted to put his own \"twist\" on films like Get Carter and The Outfit (which feature \"intimidating men in cool clothes\" on a mission of vengeance) by drawing on the deaf experience as well.",
      "\"Reunion starts out like those classic thrillers, but ends up in a very different place,\" the writer says.",
      "As main character Brennan hunts down a man known only as Monroe, viewers become aware of a painful secret he's been hiding and the struggles he is facing to find justice in a hearing-centred world.",

      "'Unfortunately, that's still the reality'",
      "Mager says communication is a central theme of Reunion and the drama shows how each character struggles with it.",
      "One key example is a scene where Brennan's daughter Carly has to pass on painful information to her mother and father that would usually be relayed by professionals, due to a lack of interpreters.",
      "\"Unfortunately, that's still the reality today,\" Mager says, explaining his wife recently experienced this, having to interpret for her mother at a hospital appointment, because an interpreter had not been booked.",
      "Mager says this shows how deaf people often have to rely on someone else voicing them in order to be understood.",
      "\"That can be hard for a deaf person to relinquish that control over what they're saying to someone else,\" he says.",
      "Another thing Mager wanted to draw attention to was literacy rates in deaf children.",
      "A key plot point in Reunion is that Brennan is unable to read or write in English which, coupled with the prison's failure to book interpreters, means he misses important letters from his daughter and does not have his case details fully explained.",
      "\"Deaf children often lag behind their hearing counterparts in education, particularly [in] reading and writing,\" Mager says.",
      "The writer adds that, in his opinion, this is partly due to language deprivation, resulting from deaf children not being given access to the language they're most comfortable with from a young age.",
      "According to Simon Want, from the National Deaf Children's Society, many deaf children face barriers to accessing a good education.",

      "In a new report, the Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) committee urged the government to improve support measures for producers while safeguarding the creation of distinctly British content.",
      "It follows an inquiry into the UK TV and film industry which examined the effects of the rise of streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon and Apple TV.",
      "The report noted how \"vital\" dramas such as Adolescence are to the country's \"identity, national conversations and talent pipeline\", which they say is now \"under threat\".",
      "It is \"time for streamers to put their money where their mouth is\", the report read, suggesting that streaming companies should pay \"5% of their UK subscriber revenue into a cultural fund to help finance drama with a specific interest to British audiences\".",
      "Chair of the CMS committee, MP Dame Caroline Dinenage, noted how recent \"big box-office blockbusters made in Britain have showcased the UK's world-class film and high-end television industry like never before\".",
      "\"But the boom in inward investment of recent years now risks crowding out our many talented independent British producers,\" she said.",
      "She added: \"While streamers like Netflix and Amazon have proved a valuable addition for the industry and economy, unless the government urgently intervenes to rebalance the playing field, for every Adolescence adding to the national conversation, there will be countless distinctly British stories that never make it to our screens.\"",

      "A Netflix spokeswoman said: \"The UK is Netflix's biggest production hub outside of North America - and we want it to stay that way.",
      "\"But in an increasingly competitive global market, it's key to create a business environment that incentivises rather than penalises investment, risk taking and success. Levies diminish competitiveness and penalise audiences who ultimately bear the increased costs.\"",

      "The arrival of the streamers into the UK market \"drove up the price of everything\", Kosminsky told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday, to the point where the public service broadcasters \"couldn't afford to make their programs anymore, so we need a new pot of money.\"",
      "He underlined how 17 other countries in Europe have imposed a similar levy \"so that public service broadcasters can stay in the game.\"",
      "Speaking on the same programme, former BBC One controller Peter Fincham replied saying he did not agree.",

      "'Support freelancers'",
      "The report also noted while the introduction of tax breaks for independent British films, and for film and TV studios in England may have helped, it was not a \"silver bullet\" for solving many of the issues facing British producers.",
      "As well as providing greater support and resources for UK TV production workforces, it also suggested that lawmakers should consider cutting VAT on cinema tickets as well as doing more to meet the challenges posed by AI.",
      "Commenting on the report, Paul W Fleming, general secretary of Equity, which represents British performers, said the government should \"heed the call\" for the licensing of creative works in all cases where they are used to train artificial intelligence models.",

      "Big tech firms \"must be held to account\", he added, \"brought to the table and made to pay creators what they owe.\"",

      "It stressed how the industry \"benefits hugely from the flexibility afforded by a predominantly freelance workforce\" and therefore more should be done to \"support freelancers when they are out of work\"; such as the introduction of a minimum hourly wage or guaranteed basic income.",

    "story": [
      "The young cast of Alex Garland and Ray Mendoza\u2019s film Warfare had to bond pretty quickly, to play a US military unit whose lives depended on each other, during the Iraq war in 2006.",
      "Familiarity was crucial, so before filming began, the cast were sent on a three-week military bootcamp.",
      "They lived together, learning military jargon and gun safety and were pushed beyond their limits - all of which brought them closer together.",
      "First off though, they agreed to shave each other's heads to look the part, boosting trust and familiarity.",
      "\"We shaved our heads on day one, and got tattoos at the end of the process, so it bookended the experience,\" Poulter tells the BBC.",
      "The actor, who recently appeared in The Bear and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3, plays Captain Eric, who was part of a group of US soldiers and Iraqi scouts on a surveillance mission.",
      "We see how it goes wrong, with devastating consequences.",
      "Heartstopper star Connor plays newcomer Tommy, hitting home how young the soldiers were - he's just turned 21, the same age Tommy was at the time.",
      "The actor says the decision to get a shared tattoo with his castmates after filming wrapped was a \"no-brainer\". The casts of The Avengers and The Lord of the Rings did the same thing after their final films.",
      "Warfare's actors decided their tattoo would say \"Call On Me\", to reflect their brotherhood, while referencing Erik Prydz's 2004 dance hit, which kicks the film off.",
      "The cast features some other big names, including Reservation Dogs' D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, Sh\u014dgun's Cosmo Jarvis, Stranger Things and the forthcoming Beatles biopic's Joseph Quinn, and Riverdale's Charles Melton.",
      "\"It was really formative for me,\" Connor says about his time  on the film. \"I've made friends I really do believe I will know for a long time.",
      "\"We all wanted to commemorate it - we are so proud of the work we've done together.\"",
      "The movie is based entirely on a real-life mission that took place during the Iraq war, and is built on the memories of the US soldiers who were there.",
      "The group was embedded in the home of an ordinary Iraqi family, who we briefly see in the film, in Ramadi - an area controlled by Al-Qaeda forces.",
      "The military's goal had been to slip into and observe the area under the cover of darkness, to ensure the safe passage of ground forces there the next day.",
      "What they didn't know what that they were next door to an insurgent house, making them the target of an attack.",
      "Shot in real-time, Warfare has no music or flashbacks, so there's no let-up for the audience. You're dropped into the thick of the action for the whole film.",
      "The soldiers in command have to make split-second decisions amid the pain and chaos, with the Iraqi family caught in the crossfire.",
      "Oscar nominee Garland, whose back catalogue includes the 28 Days film franchise and Ex Machina, got the idea for Warfare when he was making last year's film Civil War.",
      "He was working on the battle scenes with Hollywood stunt man and gunfight co-ordinator Ray Mendoza.",
      "\"During the edit process of Civil War, I was able to really focus on some of the work Ray had done, and how sophisticated and how nuanced it was,\" Garland recalls.",
      "They got chatting about Mendoza's previous life as a US Navy Seal, and about the Ramadi operation, where he was its communications officer.",
      "Mendoza said he'd always wanted to make a film about that mission.",
      "The veteran had a very big reason for wanting to recreate what happened that day - to help replace the lost memories of his colleague Elliott Miller.",
      "Miller, a former Navy Seal, was so badly injured in Ramadi that he suffered traumatic brain injury and memory loss, and had to have a leg amputated.",
      "During the mission, Mendoza carried the unconscious soldier to the rescue tank that ultimately saved his life.",
      "\"Elliott doesn't remember it, and when he woke up, he had a lot of questions,\" Mendoza says.",
      "\"No matter how many maps we drew, or how many times we wrote it out - without that core memory, I think he's had a hard time.",
      "\"It just raised more questions than answers. So I wanted to recreate this one.\"",
      "So Garland and Mendoza decided to make Warfare together, sharing writing and directing credits, and dedicating the film to Miller.",
      "The crucial question is whether seeing the film helped Miller piece things together.",
      "\"It did, yeah - he was a sponge,\" Mendoza says.",
      "\"We walked him through it - he had a lot of questions, he's got kids that have questions.",
      "\"It's now a film memory, but it's as close as he's gonna have \u2013 he's super grateful.\"",
      "Miller was played by Jarvis, who calls him \"a funny guy... he's great - a living embodiment of perseverance\".",
      "It was a \"unique situation to be in when you're entrusted with portraying somebody that's sitting right across from you\", Jarvis said, about having the person he was playing actually on set.",
      "\"But because he didn't remember [what happened], a lot of my references had to come from his colleagues.\"",
      "The soldiers' casting has caused some excitement online, with some publications breathily calling the actors \"all of the internet's boyfriends\" and \"red hot rising stars\".",
      "Garland arches an eyebrow at this, and Mendoza jumps in to talk about why those actors were chosen.",
      "\"I've said this to them, so I'm not trying to offend them, but we weren't looking for the best actors. They're all great actors. We were looking for the right actors,\" he says.",
      "\"So what that means is their willingness to push their bodies past a comfort level that they're maybe not used to. 'You're gonna be exhausted. You're gonna be required to rely on other people. It's not about you, it's about the team'.",
      "\"And the ones that jump at that opportunity, you're like, 'Yep, that's the attitude that we need'.\"",
      "Collating and cross-checking the soldiers' memories was a big job, largely undertaken by Garland.",
      "\"I think there's an inherent value in attempting to be honest and truthful about something as serious and significant as war,\" he says.",
      "He shot the film in a studio in a suburb north of London, on a former World War Two airfield, making it in real-time to recreate \"a real incident of combat... as honestly, forensically and accurately as possible\".",
      "Not surprisingly, while sharing credits with Garland, former US Navy Seal Mendoza ran the actors' bootcamp.",
      "He was played by Woon-A-Tai, who calls him \"a brilliant instructor who instilled a lot of confidence in us\", while also making gun safety a top priority.",
      "The actor was also fascinated by the narrative not being \"dramatised or Hollywoodised\".",
      "\"To see these guys not obey orders - and do what they needed to save their platoon was interesting to me,\" he says, talking about the soldiers' evacuation process.",
      "Mendoza thinks the film may also help veterans who are struggling to express what warfare can be like.",
      "\"Some of these things are harder to explain in words,\" he says. \"So art imagery is how I'm able to communicate that.\"",
      "Connor echoes this, saying: \"A lot of these men are very much less inclined to talk about themselves in these situations, whether it be to be due to humility, or a difficulty in really articulating it.",
      "\"A lot of them just don't really enjoy talking about their involvement.\"",
      "The film has been called \"the most harrowing \u2013 and honest \u2013 depiction of modern combat ever made\" by the Telegraph, while the New Yorker said it offers a \"hyperrealist rebuke of the American war movie\".",
      "The Guardian said the \"film-makers' message gets lost in the deafening blizzard of battle\", while Empire added: \"It may well be cinema's most effective, purest anti-war film: there is no sentimentality, no hand-wringing, but most significantly not a second of it makes war look cool, or attractive.\"",
      "Poulter says he admires the film-makers' determination to make Warfare purely factual.",
      "\"Hopefully this film contributes to a better understanding of just how negative, and how the consequences of war are characterised by a lot of loss...",
      "\"I think this is as much an anti-war film as you can possibly hope to see.\"",

      "If you're on TikTok, you will have seen the bar, which combines the flavours of chocolate, pistachio and tahini with filo pastry, and is inspired by the Arab dessert Knafeh.",
      "The original, called Can't Get Knafeh of It, by FIX Chocolatier, has been sold exclusively in the UAE since 2022. It become so popular on social media that it's only on sale for two hours a day and often sells out within minutes.",
      "But now imitations, known by the nickname \"Dubai chocolate\", have hit UK supermarkets including Waitrose, Lidl and Morrisons, with some supermarkets limiting the number of bars customers are allowed to buy.",
      "Yezen Alani, who co-owns FIX with his wife Sarah Hamouda, told the BBC the global attention Dubai chocolate was getting was \"flattering and humbling\".",
      "The FIX chocolate bar was first imagined by Hamouda in 2021, who craved the flavours while she was pregnant.",
      "Alani and Hamouda started developing the bar a year later, running the business alongside their corporate jobs.",
      "\"Sarah and I were brought up in the UK and we moved to Dubai 10 years ago, so we've got Western and Arab roots.",
      "\"We wanted to create flavours that were inspired by that,\" Alani says.",
      "Part of the appeal of the chocolate is its exclusivity - you can only order it using a food delivery app, rather than walking into a shop or grabbing it at the supermarket.",
      "It costs around \u00a315 per bar and can only be bought during specific hours of the day to ensure the company can fulfil all their orders.",
      "I also saw similar bars sold in many shops in the region, dubbed \"Dubai chocolate\" and adorned with pictures of pistachios and filo pastry.",
      "Alani says the \"copycat\" bars are \"very frustrating because people are trying knockoffs, which damages our brand\".",
      "One of the reasons for the bar's surge in popularity has been social media - with a viral video by TikTok user Maria Vehera  from 2023 being cited as one of the main reasons for its rise to prominence.",
      "It shows Vehera trying the Knafeh bar for the first time - along with several others made by the same chocolatier - and has been liked nearly seven million times.",
      "The way the bar looks is made for social media -  from the attractive orange and green spots on top of the smooth milk chocolate to the crunch sound it makes when you break off a piece.",
      "Chocolate combined with pistachio isn't new but the real standout element is the crunchy nature of the filling, with the filo pastry adding a texture and thickness to the bar.",
      "Since the Can't Get Knafeh of It bar is only available in one country, other brands have started to sell their versions in the UK, including Swiss chocolate manufacturer Lindt whose Dubai chocolate is being sold for \u00a310 in supermarkets.",
      "Since stocking the bar, Waitrose says they've had to introduce a two-bar limit for customers in order to regulate stock levels.",
      "Another version has also been sold by Home Bargains, while supermarket Lidl has its own version for \u00a34.99 and is also limiting purchase numbers.",
      "One influencer documented how the has bar been kept behind tills for this reason.",
      "Having tried the Lindt bar and a couple of other versions being sold in corner shops, there is quite a contrast.",
      "The FIX chocolate is billed as a \"dessert bar\" and needs to be kept in the fridge, with a short expiry date like many dairy items.",
      "This isn't the case for the others, which have been designed to have a longer shelf life.",
      "You can also see the difference in taste and texture - the original bar is almost double the width of the Lindt bar, which is more aligned to the size and shape of a standard chocolate bar.",
      "When Alani and Hamouda first started out, they employed one person to fulfil around six to seven orders a day.",
      "But since growing in popularity, primarily thanks to TikTok, their business now employs 50 people, who fulfil 500 orders a day.",
      "One big talking point has been the price of the product, which is \u00a315 per bar.",
      "\"It's all handmade, every single design is done by hand,\" Alani says.",
      "\"We use premium ingredients and the process is not like making other bars - you've got the baking, moulding the chocolate to the design and with the filling itself, even the pistachios are hand-picked and processed\".",
      "Speaking to Arabian Business last year, Hamouda said: \"My mother used to make Knafeh, and that's something I wanted to capture my own way.",
      "\"Knafeh was the first flavour we perfected. The crunch, the pistachio, it had to be just right,\" she added.",
      "Despite the product's success, Alani says \"it's been a tough journey\" as the pair have been working together full time while also raising their two children.",
      "\"There's been times where we've wanted to give up, but we said to ourselves 'we'll keep going as long as we can pay the rent' and now we have no regrets as its worked out\"."

      "\"We liked sweaty little venues clubs in the middle of town.\"",
      "There have been mixed reviews of the concert with Pulp guitarist Mark Webber telling BBC 6 Music describing the show as \"a slight anticlimax\".",
      "\"There was a lot of anticipation but it didn't sound very good,\" he said.",
      "\"It was very windy and the vibe wasn't there.\"",
      "Haslam said that was another example of the lack of experience of putting on such big shows.",
      "\"I don't think anyone appreciated that you need to a lot of amplification to reach the back of the crowd, because all the sound just gets lost in the atmosphere,\" he said.",
      "Mead, who is helping on a documentary project about the concert, said recently-found footage revealed \"key moments\".",
      "\"When the band play I Wanna Be Adored and you see the crowd, it's electric,\" he said.",
      "\"It's like nothing else \u2013 wall-to-wall bouncing from the front to the back.\"",
      "He said there was also \"blissed-out dancing\" during Fools Gold and \"everyone's arms in the air\" for I Am the Resurrection.",
      "Haslam also remembers fans filing out of the gig in \"very, very high spirits\".",
      "\"Whatever the problems with the sound and waiting around and all of that, I think for those young people, they knew they'd had a day out to remember,\" he added.",
      "Why has it become the stuff of legend?",
      "Until a full recording came to light in 2024, it was thought the concert had not been captured on film, making it the subject of much mystique for those who weren't there.",
      "But even with the new find, Haslam believes the gig was significant because The Stone Roses \"didn't play that often\" and it felt like \"a life-changing moment\".",
      "\"It was an opportunity to see this band that had somehow seemed to be the most significant band of the era.",
      "\"It was the culmination of two or three years when a certain look and a sound that was a kind of cross between funky indie and rave really animated a new generation.\"",
      "He said the Spike Island show was part of a series of gigs that \"took The Stone Roses from being a big local band and a kind of Manchester secret to being internationally renowned\".",
      "Crews travelled from France and Germany for the event while fans came from across the country.",
      "Haslam said there \"wasn't really anything similar afterwards\" for the band due to the time it took the band to release a second album.",
      "\"That took far too long - four or five years - so a lot of the momentum went out of the Roses at that point and by the time they came back, that part of the world had all moved on to Oasis\".",
      "He said Spike Island \"was the only moment where you had The Stone Roses absolutely at their peak, playing music that had been quite underground but had been becoming accepted by the mainstream - that mix of euphoric rave vibe with rock music\".",
      "What happened to The Stone Roses?",
      "After the Spike Island show, The Stone Roses became embroiled in a long legal battle with their record label and did not release a follow-up album, The Second Coming, until 1994.",
      "Three months after its release, Reni left the band and was followed a year later by Squire.",
      "Brown and Mani tried to carry on with guitarist Aziz Ibrahim and drummer Robbie Maddix joining the band, but within a few months, they dissolved the band.",
      "Squire, Brown and Mani went on to have post-Roses success, while Reni left music altogether.",
      "After years of rumours, the original line-up finally reformed in 2011, going on to play huge gigs across the globe before Squire confirmed in 2019 that they had split once more.",
      "How did the gig come to inspire Pulp?",
      "Though Pulp had been a working band for over a decade when Spike Island happened, they did not break into the mainstream until the release of their His 'n' Hers album in 1994, before becoming huge stars with the release of their landmark single Common People a year later.",
      "That song was taken from their most successful album, Different Class, which also spawned the hit, Sorted for E's and Wizz, which Cocker has now revealed was a sister song to the new single and was also based on a fan's experience of the Stone Roses' gig.",
      "The inspiration for that track was \"a girl that I was speaking to at The Leadmill (nightclub) in Sheffield one night,\" he said.",
      "\"She said all that she could remember were people going round saying, 'Is everyone sorted for E's and wizz?'.",
      "\"So that phrase stuck in my mind.\"",
      "He said he did not go to Spike Island, but had written the new song's lyrics after speaking to various attendees, including musician Jason Buckle, from the band All Seeing I, who co-wrote the single.",
      "\"All he could remember was a DJ who between every song said, 'Spike Island come alive, Spike Island come alive',\" he said.",

      "Renowned for its often savvy and disturbing takes on humanity and our relationship with technology, Black Mirror is back for a seventh series at a time when the pace of change in both politics and tech has left many of us - including lawmakers - struggling to keep up.",

      "It doesn't take long to make David Hockney laugh.",
      "At nearly 88 years old, he is frail but still very dapper in his beige, red and black houndstooth suit with a white silk handkerchief poking out of the pocket, and trademark round yellow glasses perched on his nose.",
      "Britain's most popular artist chuckles a lot, his throaty laugh betraying his many years of smoking.",
      "But, he tells me, as a young student from Bradford at the Royal College of Art in London in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the other students laughed at him.",
      "\"People would mock my accent,\" he says. But it didn't faze him. Hockney knew his worth even then. \"I'd look at their artworks and I'd think, well, if I drew like that, I'd keep my mouth shut.\"",
      "What would the young boy growing up in Bradford think about the life he'd go on to have and the work he'd create?",
      "\"He'd have thought it was pretty daft.\"",
      "For decades, Hockney has been among the world's greatest living artists, and he is now opening his biggest ever show.",
      "As we sit together in a vast gallery at the Louis Vuitton Foundation, a stunning museum designed in reflective glass on the edge of the Bois de Boulogne in Paris, I ask him what he thinks of the exhibition.",
      "He says it's his best ever, and bursts into laughter again.",
      "It's an expression of pure delight at the 11 rooms filled across four floors with his art - and at being alive to see it. \"I'm just laughing, I mean we made it!\"",
      "Two years ago, when they started planning the exhibition, \"I just thought I probably wouldn't be here\", he says. \"I'm still a smoker, a happy smoker fed up of bossy people telling you what to do... but I didn't know.\"",
      "Hockney is sporting a badge that says \"End Bossiness Soon\" in a gallery dedicated to his love of spring. During the pandemic in 2020, Hockney, who was living in Normandy, used his iPad to paint the trees and flowers blooming as spring arrived.",
      "Those 220 iPad works adorn this gallery, floor to ceiling, the walls bursting with blossom and pure joy, made at a time when the world wasn't feeling very hopeful.",
      "Visitors to the show are greeted at the entrance by Hockney's message from that time: \"Do remember they can't cancel the spring.\"",
      "Hockney has been in poor health. He now has two full-time carers, who have accompanied him to Paris from London, where he now lives. Portraits of both, sitting in their dark blue nurses' uniforms, are the most recent works in the exhibition, made earlier this year.",
      "A self-portrait of Hockney, painting and smoking a cigarette (his two great loves) is also very new.",
      "He still paints for four to six hours every day, he tells me.",
      "He believes you can't judge a painter until their last work is done - but looking at his own work gathered together in Paris, \"I can see what I was always trying to do, really\".",
      "And he promises that \"anybody who has just a little visual sensibility will really enjoy this show\".",
      "His great-nephew Richard Hockney, who has regularly sat for him for 28 years, since he was four years old, including for this exhibition, tells me everyone was determined the artist would make it to Paris.",
      "The night before, Hockney got into a car with his dachshund Tess to be driven across the Channel. And on the morning before they left, they were playing him variations of the jazz classic April in Paris.",
      "Having arrived, \"he is glowing\", Richard says. \"I think this will keep him going for a long, long time, to be honest.\"",
      "And with spring unfolding in the French capital, it's entirely appropriate that the artist known for chronicling spring would open his exhibition, David Hockney 25, now.",
      "This is a man who would fly back from his home in Los Angeles when he heard the hawthorn had begun to blossom in his native Yorkshire, just so he could paint the dazzling spectacle.",
      "Some of his earliest works, including probably his most famous, A Bigger Splash, are also on show in Paris.",
      "That painting, capturing the moment of a swimmer diving into a Santa Monica pool, is on the wall next to Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures), the south of France pool painting that broke records when it sold at auction in 2018 for \u00a370m.",
      "Next to those are Mr and Mrs Clark and Percy, another of Hockney's most recognisable works, which depicts his good friend Celia Birtwell and her husband Ossie Clark, with their white cat on his knee.  Seeing them brought together in one room is spectacular.",
      "But the show's main focus is the last 25 years because \"it's 2025\", he says. \"People think it's miserable, but in 1925 they'd had the First World War.\"",
      "It's a visual feast, full of the bright colours and optimism for which Hockney has become known.",
      "\"I've always had it. I've always thought it was an absurd world.\"",
      "A world to laugh at, to look at closely, as Hockney does, and to paint vibrantly.",
      "Some of the iPad paintings are huge. He's \"amazed they could be blown up so big\" when they were created on something so small.",
      "One room is almost pitch dark to show off paintings he did of the Moon, made possible by advances in iPad technology.",
      "There's also a floor devoted to his portraits (about 60), including a 2022 painting of singer Harry Styles in a striped cardigan with a set of pearls around his neck.",

      "Children in Africa and South East Asia were found to be most at risk.",
      "Antimicrobial resistance - known as AMR - develops when the microbes that cause infections evolve in such a way that antibiotic drugs no longer work.",

      "A new study now reveals the toll that AMR is taking on children.",

      "Increased use of antibiotics",
      "Antibiotics are used to treat or prevent a huge range of bacterial infections - everything from skin infections to pneumonia.",
      "They are also sometimes given as a precaution to prevent, rather than treat, an infection - for example if someone is having an operation or receiving chemotherapy treatment for cancer.",
      "Antibiotics have no impact on viral infections, though - illnesses such as the common cold, flu or Covid.",
      "But some bacteria have now evolved resistance to some drugs, due to their overuse and inappropriate use, while the production of new antibiotics  - a lengthy and costly process - has slowed right down.",
      "The report's lead authors, Doctor Yanhong Jessika Hu of Murdoch Children's Research Institute in Australia and Professor Herb Harwell of the Clinton Health Access Initiative, point to a significant growth in the use of antibiotics that are meant to only be held back for the most serious infections.",
      "Between 2019 and 2021 the use of \"watch antibiotics\", drugs with a high risk of resistance, increased by 160% in South East Asia and 126% in Africa.",
      "Over the same period, \"reserve antibiotics\" -  last-resort treatments for severe, multidrug-resistant infections - rose by 45% in South East Asia and 125% in Africa.",
      "Dwindling options",
      "The authors warn that if bacteria develop resistance to these antibiotics, there will be few, if any, alternatives for treating multidrug-resistant infections.",
      "Prof Harwell is presenting the findings at the Congress of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases in Vienna later this month.",
      "\"AMR is a global problem. It affects everyone. We did this work really to focus on the disproportionate way in which AMR affects children,\" he said ahead of the event.",

      "Is there a solution to AMR?",
      "The WHO describes AMR as one of the most serious global health threats we face, but speaking from Vienna, Prof Harwell warns that there are no easy answers.",
      "\"It's a multi-faceted problem that extends into all aspects of medicine and really, human life,\" he said.",
      "\"Antibiotics are ubiquitous around us, they end up in our food and the environment and so coming up with a single solution is not easy.\"",
      "The best way to avoid a resistant infection is to avoid infection altogether, which means higher levels of immunisation, water sanitation and hygiene are needed, he adds.",
      "\"There's going to be more antibiotics use because there's more people who need them, but we need to make sure that they are used appropriately and the correct medicines are used.\"",
      "Dr Lindsey Edwards, a senior lecturer in microbiology at King's College London, said the new study \"marks a significant and alarming increase compared to previous data\".",

      "Key to the smiley face game Henry is playing is where that face appears on the iPad screen. Just as the toddler gets used to the face repeatedly popping up on the right side of his screen, it randomly starts appearing on the other side too.",
      "\"We're seeing if Henry can resist the urge to just keep tapping on the right,\" explains research assistant Carmel Brough, \"and instead look for where the smiley face is.\"",

      "\"Working memory is when we need to keep a little bit of information in our head to solve a problem or do a task - like a puzzle, or even just remembering where we put something two minutes ago,\" explains Dr Holmboe. \"For children, you can imagine we need these skills when we learn maths or learn to read.",

      "The project's data has been made available to scientists around the world and has been cited in thousands of scientific papers.",
      "One study of the diets of children of the 90s provided evidence that, while a child's fussy eating is often worrying, it is unlikely to have any lasting impact on their health and development.",
      "Thanks to repeated health-screenings that have been key to the project, it also revealed that one in five young people shows signs of fatty liver disease, and one in 40 young people may have liver scarring - caused largely by obesity and alcohol consumption. This has shown just how common the condition is and provided insights into ways it can be prevented through diet.",

    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump says he will soon announce \"major\" tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals, a move that could end decades of low-cost global trade in medicines.",
      "For years, most countries, including the US, have imposed few or no tariffs on finished drugs, thanks in part to a 1995 World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreement aimed at keeping medicines affordable.",
      "This shift comes after Trump introduced a blanket 10% tariff on other imports last week, as part of a broader effort to bring manufacturing back to the US.",
      "His new \"reciprocal\" tariffs - including a duty of 104% on goods arriving from China - came into force on Wednesday, intensifying a global trade war and further shaking markets.",
      "Pharmaceutical buyers, so far spared from such measures, are now preparing for what may come next.",
      "The US has typically imported vast quantities of finished medicines from India, Europe and China without buyers paying tariffs - although active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), used to make drugs, do face some duties.",
      "Speaking at a fundraiser dinner for his Republican Party on Tuesday, Trump said: \"We're going to be announcing very shortly a major tariff on pharmaceuticals. And when they hear that, they will leave China.\"",
      "He also told reporters on board his Air Force One plane last week that \"pharma\" tariffs would arrive \"at a level that you haven't really seen before\", saying these would be announced \"in the near future\".",
      "In 2024, the US imported $213bn (\u00a3168bn) worth of medicines - more than two and a half times the total a decade earlier.",
      "While short on detail, his comments have rattled buyers, especially those relying on Indian imports. India supplies nearly half of all US generics, or cheaper versions of popular drugs, saving the country billions in healthcare costs.",

      "Indian pharma stocks fell sharply on the news. India sends about a third of its $13bn annual pharma exports to the US, which is a key market.",
      "At the moment, Americans pay little or no tax on imports of Indian medicines - compared with the duty of nearly 11% paid by Indians importing American medicines.",
      "Indian drugmakers warn that tariffs would force them to raise prices, which could ultimately drive up US medical bills. While firms like Cipla and Dr Reddy's have US plants, most say moving production is not viable for low-margin generic drugs.",
      "European drugmakers are also on alert. After a high-level meeting between European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and top pharma firms on Tuesday, the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) warned that tariffs could shift production away from Europe, and to the US.",
      "The EFPIA, whose members include major pharmaceutical companies such as Bayer, Novartis, and Novo Nordisk - the maker of the star diabetes type 2 drug Ozempic - expressed concerns that rising tariffs could disrupt Europe's role as a key player in global pharmaceutical production.",
      "In 2024, pharmaceuticals were the EU's largest export to the US, worth a reported $127bn (\u00a3100bn).",
      "Major companies have urged the EU to act swiftly, seeking policy changes to enhance Europe's competitiveness and prevent a \"mass exodus\" to the US. They have also expressed concerns about potential EU retaliatory tariffs, which could disrupt supply chains and affect patients on both sides of the Atlantic.",

      "Asked if he could guarantee the furnaces would remain open, Jonathan Reynolds said he would not comment \"on the commercial aspect of supply\" but the takeover gave the \"opportunity\" to obtain the coal needed.",

      "Speaking on the programme, Reynolds said the situation remains \"difficult and challenging\".",

      "British Steel's plant in Scunthorpe is the last plant in the UK capable of producing virgin steel, which has fewer imperfections and is used in major construction projects like new buildings and railways.",

      "A government department run by one of Sir Keir Starmer's most senior ministers is cutting almost a third of its jobs as ministers seek to accelerate civil service reform.",
      "Officials at the Cabinet Office - headed by Pat McFadden - are being told today that 2,100 of their 6,500 jobs will be cut or moved to other parts of government over the next two years. Along with other reforms, the Cabinet Office says the cuts will save \u00a3110m a year by 2028.",

      "A source said he was \"leading by example\" with the cuts to his own department.",

      "The UK economy grew by more than predicted in February and exports to the US increased by \u00a3500m as businesses rushed to beat US tariffs.",
      "The economy expanded by 0.5%, with the services sector having a strong month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.",
      "The better-than-expected figures come as the UK economy braces itself for the impact of tariffs imposed on goods imported to the US, with analysts warning that growth could prove short-lived.",
      "Tariffs on steel and aluminium came into effect on 12 March, while a 10% tariff on other goods came into effect this week.",
      "Goods exports from the UK to the US increased for the third consecutive month and are now at the highest level since November 2022, the ONS said.",
      "\"There are clear signs that UK firms increased goods exports to the US ahead of the introduction of tariffs,\" said William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC).",
      "\"Data for the past three months shows a 23% increase in the value of goods flowing from the UK across the Atlantic,\" Mr Bain said.",
      "Economists had predicted UK growth of just 0.1% in February, but the ONS said several factors contributed to the surprise rise which was driven by a boost in manufacturing and production.",
      "The government has made growing the UK economy its top priority in its effort to improve living standards.",
      "Liz McKeown, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said February's surprise growth was due to computer programming, telecoms and car dealerships in the services sector all having \"strong months\".",
      "She added that manufacturing, electronics and pharmaceutical businesses performed well, and the car making industry also picked up after \"its recent poor performance\".",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves called the latest growth figures an \"encouraging sign\", but added the government was \"not complacent\".",
      "\"We must go further and faster to kickstart economic growth, provide security for working people and put more money in their pockets,\" she added.",
      "The UK is subject to the blanket 10% tariff on nearly all of its goods being brought into the US, which is expected to hit British exporters and also affect economic growth.",
      "Mr Bain from the BCC said securing a deal with the US and removing trade barriers with the EU would be \"key to cushioning the negative impacts of the sweeping new US tariffs\".",
      "Speaking to reporters, Reeves said: \"We continue to engage with our counterparts in the United States and of course we want to secure the best deal possible for British jobs and British industry and we are absolutely committed and resolved to do everything we can,\" she told reporters.",
      "How fast is the UK's economy growing?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Alongside the better-than-expected growth, the ONS revised up its figure for January from a contraction of 0.1% to no growth.",
      "Monthly figures alone can be volatile so should be taken in context. The more stable three-month average to February shows growth is up 0.6%.",
      "This would have been considered normal growth a decade ago, but has been elusive in recent years.",
      "However, it suggests that recent talk of a recession has been way off the mark.",
      "But February's figure comes ahead of the impact of tax rises on businesses and household energy and water bill increases on the economy, along with US tariffs.",
      "Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist, said the UK's \"surprisingly strong growth will prove short lived, as rises in tariffs and taxes bite\".",
      "\"The big picture is that the economy has grown in only four of the last nine months and it's hard to see the economy strengthening much from here,\" she said.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said: \"Since coming to office, Labour's choices have killed growth stone dead and there is still a long way to go to recover.\"",

      "'Pragmatic and sensible'",
      "However, the Reform UK leader has not ruled out more informal routes to share power with other parties.",

    "story": [
      "A share of the revenue streaming services make from subscription fees should be paid into a fund to support British high-end TV production, an influential group of MPs has said.",
      "In a new report, the Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) committee urged the government to improve support measures for producers while safeguarding the creation of distinctly British content.",
      "It follows an inquiry into the UK TV and film industry which examined the effects of the rise of streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon and Apple TV.",
      "The report noted how \"vital\" dramas such as Adolescence are to the country's \"identity, national conversations and talent pipeline\", which they say is now \"under threat\".",
      "It is \"time for streamers to put their money where their mouth is\", the report read, suggesting that streaming companies should pay \"5% of their UK subscriber revenue into a cultural fund to help finance drama with a specific interest to British audiences\".",
      "Chair of the CMS committee, MP Dame Caroline Dinenage, noted how recent \"big box-office blockbusters made in Britain have showcased the UK's world-class film and high-end television industry like never before\".",
      "\"But the boom in inward investment of recent years now risks crowding out our many talented independent British producers,\" she said.",
      "She added: \"While streamers like Netflix and Amazon have proved a valuable addition for the industry and economy, unless the government urgently intervenes to rebalance the playing field, for every Adolescence adding to the national conversation, there will be countless distinctly British stories that never make it to our screens.\"",

      "This week, it became fourth most popular English-language series in Netflix's history with 114 million views.",
      "A Netflix spokeswoman said: \"The UK is Netflix's biggest production hub outside of North America - and we want it to stay that way.",
      "\"But in an increasingly competitive global market, it's key to create a business environment that incentivises rather than penalises investment, risk taking and success. Levies diminish competitiveness and penalise audiences who ultimately bear the increased costs.\"",
      "The Association for Commercial Broadcasters and On-Demand Services (COBA) said a levy risks damaging streamers' investment in the UK.",
      "Coba executive director Adam Minns said: \"Especially in this economic climate, a levy risks impacting existing content budgets for UK shows, jobs, and growth, along with raising costs for businesses.",
      "\"Ironically, it could actually damage public service broadcaster dramas by reducing co-production budgets at streamers.\"",
      "He added pressure on domestic production stemmed from the real terms decline in the TV licence fee.",
      "A BBC spokesman said the corporation \"continues to invest\" in British content but faced \"significant financial challenges due to pressure on the licence fee and rising industry costs\".",
      "\"It is therefore integral that the BBC and the wider UK creative industries have the support in place to drive growth in the creative economy and support homegrown content and storytelling.\"",
      "The report released on Thursday noted how last year there was a 27% decrease in the number of domestic high-end TV productions made in the UK and a 25% fall in spend.",
      "The calls for greater help come after Wolf Hall director Peter Kosminsky told BBC News last month that the industry was in crisis, and that public service broadcasters including the BBC and ITV could no longer afford to make high-end British drama.",
      "Fair levy or unfair tariff?",
      "The arrival of the streamers into the UK market \"drove up the price of everything\", Kosminsky told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday, to the point where the public service broadcasters \"couldn't afford to make their programs anymore, so we need a new pot of money.\"",
      "He underlined how 17 other countries in Europe have imposed a similar levy \"so that public service broadcasters can stay in the game.\"",
      "Speaking on the same programme, former BBC One controller Peter Fincham replied saying he did not agree.",
      "\"I think this sounds to me a little bit like a tariff - to use a more fashionable word - and indeed a form of protectionism.\"",
      "A spokeswoman for the Department of Culture Media and Sport (DCMS) said: \"We acknowledge the challenges facing our brilliant film and TV industry and are working with it through our industrial strategy to consider what more needs to be done to unlock growth and develop the skills pipeline.",
      "\"We thank the committee for its report which we will respond to in due course.\"",
      "'Support freelancers'",
      "The report also noted while the introduction of tax breaks for independent British films, and for film and TV studios in England may have helped, it was not a \"silver bullet\" for solving many of the issues facing British producers.",
      "As well as providing greater support and resources for UK TV production workforces, it also suggested that lawmakers should consider cutting VAT on cinema tickets as well as doing more to meet the challenges posed by AI.",
      "Commenting on the report, Paul W Fleming, general secretary of Equity, which represents British performers, said the government should \"heed the call\" for the licensing of creative works in all cases where they are used to train artificial intelligence models.",

      "Big tech firms \"must be held to account\", he added, \"brought to the table and made to pay creators what they owe.\"",
      "The cross-party committee recommended the government and British Film Institute (BFI) should launch a national awareness campaign, highlighting the employment opportunities offered by film and high-end TV, and \"the range of skills the industry requires\".",
      "It stressed how the industry \"benefits hugely from the flexibility afforded by a predominantly freelance workforce\" and therefore more should be done to \"support freelancers when they are out of work\"; such as the introduction of a minimum hourly wage or guaranteed basic income.",
      "Head of industry union Bectu, Philippa Childs, said: \"We welcome this timely and incisive report from the committee which identifies many of the urgent challenges currently facing the industry and its workforce.\"",

    "story": [
      "The first Universal theme park in Europe will be built in the UK, the government has promised.",
      "The attraction is planned for the site of a former brickworks near Bedford and could create an estimated 28,000 jobs before opening in 2031.",
      "Universal estimated the 476-acre complex could attract 8.5 million visitors in its first year.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer said the multibillion-pound investment by the company would \"see Bedford home to one of the biggest entertainment parks in Europe, firmly putting the county on the global stage\".",
      "The prime minister joked that his children, aged 14 and 16, were uncharacteristically interested in the news.",
      "\"They don't take that much interest in the announcements I'm making every day, I have to admit, but this one has really caught their eye,\" said Starmer, speaking on a visit to Kimberley College in nearby Stewartby.",
      "Universal, which has made films including Minions and Wicked, has theme parks in Orlando and Los Angeles in the US, as well as in Japan, Singapore and China.",
      "The site - which is the former Kempston Hardwick brickworks - will be \"one of the largest and most advanced\" theme parks on the continent once complete, the production company says.",
      "A full planning proposal will be submitted to the UK government, with construction expected to start in 2026.",
      "Universal had previously given its name to the PortAventura resort in Spain, but it is understood the UK attraction will be the first in Europe it has designed and built from scratch.",
      "Universal Destinations and Experience said 80% of those employed in the new jobs would be from Bedford, central Bedfordshire, Luton and Milton Keynes.",
      "Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy hailed the \"landmark investment\" as \"fantastic news\" for the economy.",
      "\"This is not just about bringing great American creations to Britain, this is also about showcasing great British creations to the world,\" she told BBC Breakfast.",
      "\"These are things like James Bond, Paddington Bear, these are things like Harry Potter. We've got so much to be proud of.\"",
      "Universal's Orlando resort in Florida brought in 9.75 million visitors in 2023, while its Hollywood resort saw 9.66 million the same year - according to the Theme Index Report.",
      "In 2016, NBCUniversal agreed to a seven-year deal with Warner Bros. That meant it had television rights to show the Harry Potter films and the Fantastic Beasts franchise.",
      "The prime minister said the theme park would create jobs across construction, artificial intelligence and tourism.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the government had agreed with Universal that British steel would be used \"where possible\" on the project.",
      "\"That's the case with HS2, with Heathrow, and with this private investment here in Bedfordshire,\" she said.",
      "According to plans from Universal Destinations & Experiences, the UK site would include a theme park, a 500-room hotel and a retail complex.",
      "Universal has already bought 476 acres for the project, but could buy more land to increase the plot to about 700 acres - which would improve transport links.",
      "Residents living in surrounding villages have responded positively to the plans, though some are concerned infrastructure will not be enough to support the amount of expected visitors.",
      "Universal said it had surveyed more than 6,000 local people and organisations, and 92% of those supported the project.",
      "Universal said it would make upgrades to the Wixams railway station and build a new station on the East West Rail line near the resort.",
      "It would also add dedicated slip roads to the A421, which flooded in October after heavy rainfall.",
      "On Thursday, Secretary of State for Transport Heidi Alexander approved expansion plans at the nearby London Luton Airport.",
      "Universal previously described the Bedford site as \"an ideal location with convenient, fast rail links to London and London Luton Airport\".",
      "Nandy also said the government's commitment to improve local transport infrastructure had helped secure the deal with Universal.",
      "Shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said the previous Conservative administration worked closely with Universal Studios to \"secure the land\" and \"bring forward the plans\".",
      "\"We're pleased that, despite Labour's economic mismanagement, Universal Studios has committed to investing in Bedfordshire,\" he added.",
      "Mike Cavanagh, the president of Comcast Corporation, which owns Universal, said he was excited to expand the parks brand into Europe.",
      "The company said it would work with Bedford Borough Council on the project.",
      "The local authority was one of six councils to support the plans last year, alongside Central Bedfordshire, Luton, Milton Keynes, north Northamptonshire and west Northamptonshire councils.",
      "Mayor of Bedford Tom Wootton told BBC Breakfast it was the \"best news\" for the town in \"a very long time\".",
      "\"Some of the brightest and most fantastic people at Universal are working on [the infrastructure],\" he said.",
      "Bedford residents had mixed thoughts on the plans when asked on Wednesday.",
      "Margaret Wilson, 85, from Elstow, said she would not visit the theme park but believed her grandsons, aged 19 and 16, would enjoy it.",
      "But she said: \"It will be four years until anything is built. Who knows what will happen in four years?\"",
      "Maria Perez, a warehouse worker in the area, said the theme park would be \"really great\" for families and young people.",
      "\"It will be good for the economy, for the town and for the people. People will invest more.\"",
      "She said it would not be good for rent prices, but overall felt it would be positive for Bedford.",
      "Jagdeep Singh is a 36-year-old business change analyst from Kempston.",
      "While he believed the theme park would drive businesses and bring jobs, he feared the number of visitors could have a negative effect.",
      "\"I worried a bit about traffic on the bypass - what's going to happen to our hospitals if there's any accidents?\" he added.",

    "summary": "The vote later won't determine British Steel's future, but is a first step towards a possible nationalisation.",
    "story": [
      "\"Who was going to blink first?\"",
      "A source involved in the fraught negotiations since the election over the future of British Steel told me that as time passed, and literally, coal to keep the furnaces burning started to run out, that was the question - was the government going to offer even more to the Chinese owners of British Steel, Jingye, or act itself?",
      "On Saturday, the government is changing the law to answer that question.",
      "Unless something truly weird happens, Parliament will vote to give Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, the power to tell British Steel what to do \u2013 in practice, buying coal to keep the fires burning, to keep the once mighty steel industry alive.",
      "Follow latest updates as Parliament recalled over British Steel",
      "Follow latest updates as Parliament recalled over British Steel",
      "Even on Thursday he was offering taxpayers' cash to buy the raw materials to keep the furnaces alive as a sweetener for Jingye.",
      "At one point in the talks, sources suggest they were asking for a billion-pound taxpayer bailout to keep the plant alive. But I'm told that price wouldn't have been accompanied by any guarantee that jobs would be saved, or the plant protected for good.",
      "Taking control on Saturday does not do that. The Chinese owners will remain the shareholders, for now. But Labour's decision literally and metaphorically keeps the flames alive \u2013 the government hopes. And it commits taxpayers to start coughing up to save the steel industry \u2013 for how long, is a more complicated question.",
      "So what then? Theoretically, Jingye could \"get their act together and take the company back\", one insider suggests.",
      "Talking to interested parties on Friday night, that seemed vanishingly unlikely.",
      "The UK government has spent the last couple of weeks trying to tempt them to stay on board with huge inducements. That failed, so the chances of getting back involved seem pretty slim.",
      "Why is British Steel in trouble and who owns it?",
      "Why is British Steel in trouble and who owns it?",
      "There is the possibility that another company wants to swoop in and rescue the business.",
      "Again, don't hold your breath \u2013 the company has been losing money hand over fist, the blast furnaces are nearing the end of their useful life, and the cost of energy it gulps is enormous.",
      "So in the current state, taking on the business as an offer? It's not that pretty. Remember Jingye were the only bidder last time round \u2013 when a Conservative source says, \"there were no other bidders \u2013 the alternative was closure or nationalisation, and the Conservatives were never going to nationalise\". So will Labour?",
      "As of this weekend, that seems pretty likely. Remember the action in Parliament later does not mean nationalisation. But it's a necessary first step if that is what's going to happen.",
      "You've probably heard ministers again and again say \"all options are on the table\"  - that's their get out of jail card where they don't commit to anything in case their preferred option suddenly disappears. But as MPs gather to vote on the next steps, a journey towards nationalisation certainly feels like the direction.",
      "Two different sources who have been part of the wider discussions tell me the prime minister has come to believe that taking British Steel back into public hands is what the government will have to do. There are practical and political reasons for why that might come to pass.",
      "First, for the government to have a hope of achieving its aims - building infrastructure, spending more on defence at home, growing the economy and protecting jobs - it is logical to preserve a steel industry in this country.",
      "That's not just because ministers are loathe to see good jobs disappear. But because in government, the capacity to make steel is an important part of what the UK needs to be able to do. If the plant closes, the UK would become the only G7 country without primary steel making capability.",
      "That wasn't something the government was willing to tolerate. So if the private sector won't do it \u2013 enter the state. Although, it wouldn't be unfair to wonder why they have ended up making this decision at the last minute when the fuel for the furnaces is about to run out, given it was three weeks ago that the company sounded the alarm about possible closures.",
      "Second, that requirement to act has become politically attractive because it fits into Sir Keir Starmer's more and more familiar script, that the new world order has changed \u2013 governments need to be more active and agile in protecting their own interests.",
      "It follows, if, as Treasury Minister Darren Jones, told us last week, globalisation is over, then the UK has to be able to make the materials and products like steel that it really needs itself.",
      "One source remarks: \"Dragging the Tories to Parliament over the weekend to back the Labour government's plans to save British steel: I can finally see why people said government was worth it\".",
      "It is politics after all.",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has blamed the government's \"incompetence\" for the last-minute recall, while Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said it was an opportunity to come up with \"a serious plan\" for domestic steel production.",
      "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said the government's plan was just a \"short-term sticking plaster\" and both he and the Green Party have called for public ownership as the only option.",
      "It is worth remembering the problems in the steel industry didn't start with Donald Trump, or this government, or even Jingye. Steel was nationalised in 1967, then sold back into the private sector in 1988.",
      "Frantic negotiations with government about jobs, bailouts, survival are familiar. But there is gathering momentum around nationalisation as the solution, in a way unthinkable not so long ago.",
      "Hypothetical conversations started at the top of government a couple of months ago about the possibility, detailed work only in the last week or so. But there is a growing consensus - one source familiar with the situation even says, \"nationalisation is inevitable and has been for some time\".",
      "But \u2013 \"the hurdles are huge\" \u2013 a source tells me. The most obvious obstacle? Cold hard cash, way beyond the initial price tag for raw materials to keep Scunthorpe going for a few more weeks.",
      "In the long term, the blast furnaces are near the end of their life, the plant needs investment, massive investment, to make it safe and to have a proper future. One industry source told me modern electric furnaces could have a price tag as as much as \u00a33bn each, and Scunthorpe might need two.",
      "Energy costs for new or existing furnaces are enormous. In Number 10 and Number 11 there is an acknowledgement that the costs of energy for industry can be crippling. That could be another area where government is keen to act.",
      "The government hasn't yet shared, or hasn't yet worked out, what the potential cost of taking on the plant in the long term might be. A Treasury source says it will have to be within the current plans for spending. And you don't need me to remind you again how tight Number 11 says money is, how tightly Chancellor Rachel Reeves wants to stick to her spending rules.",
      "And yet \u2013 if a big ticket effective nationalisation is the political choice, and it runs to many billions? Let's see.",
      "MPs voting later won't determine the entire future for British Steel. But it puts the government on a path to make real some of its rhetoric in recent weeks, as one figure put it \u2013 \"neoliberalism is over. Ownership matters again -  Labour needs to define Britain's place in this new,  new world order\".",
      "But passing a law in a rush is one thing. Political excitement another. Sir Keir used to attract ire from the left of his own party for walking away from some of his previous beliefs in common ownership, nationalising vital industries. Embarking on an expensive and complicated adventure to preserve a struggling multi-billion pound industry was not meant to be part of the plan.",

    "published": "Sun, 13 Apr 2025 01:48:28 GMT",
    "summary": "An emergency law has handed control of the UK's only remaining plant making virgin steel to the government.",
    "story": [
      "The UK government has taken control of British Steel's plant in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, after it was put at risk of imminent closure.",
      "MPs were called back to Parliament on Saturday from their Easter break to pass an emergency law that handed control of the Chinese-owned site to the government, in order to keep its two blast furnaces operating.",
      "What is British Steel and how many people work there?",
      "British Steel's plant in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, employs 2,700 people, about three-quarters of the company's entire workforce.",
      "It is the last plant in the UK capable of producing virgin steel, which is used in major construction projects like new buildings and railways.",
      "Two huge blast furnaces are used to produce the steel, which has fewer imperfections than the recycled steel made elsewhere in the country.",
      "Were the plant to cease producing virgin steel, the UK would become the only member of the G7 group of leading economies without the ability to make it - a prospect the government views as a risk to the country's long-term economic security.",
      "Who owns British Steel and has it been nationalised?",
      "The company was founded in 2016 when Tata Steel sold its loss-making long products division in Scunthorpe to private investment firm Greybull Capital for a token \u00a31.",
      "The new owners renamed the business British Steel.",
      "Following a period of financial instability, British Steel was taken over by the government's insolvency service in 2019 and then acquired by Chinese steel-making firm Jingye the following year.",
      "In late March 2025, Jingye said the plant was losing around \u00a3700,000 a day and launched a consultation on its closure.",
      "The government held talks with Jingye aimed at keeping the plant operational.",
      "After these appeared to have largely broken down, emergency legislation was fast-tracked through Parliament in a single day on Saturday - handing control of the plant to the government.",
      "Jingye still owns the site, but the business secretary now has sweeping powers to control management and workers to make sure production continues.",
      "This means British Steel has not been nationalised - which is when a government takes ownership and control of a company.",
      "But Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds acknowledged that public ownership was \"the likely option\".",
      "While the government hopes to secure private investment to save the plant, ministers admit there are currently no companies willing to buy it.",
      "Why did the government step in?",
      "The supplies needed to keep the blast furnaces running - coking coal and iron pellets - are running low at the Scunthorpe plant.",
      "This added time pressure to the talks, because once a blast furnace shuts down it is a costly and complex process to restart it.",
      "Unions said the situation was on a \"cliff-edge,\" while the Community Union described the lack of supplies as an \"extreme emergency\".",
      "The government offered to buy the raw materials needed to keep the furnaces running earlier this week, but Jingye did not agree to that proposal.",
      "In the Commons on Saturday, the business secretary said Jingye had wanted \"an excessive amount\" of money.",
      "He said it had become clear during negotiations that the company intended to \"refuse\" to buy enough material to keep the furnaces running, and \"to cancel and refuse to pay for existing orders\".",
      "\"The company would therefore have irrevocably and unilaterally closed down primary steel making at British Steel,\" he added.",
      "The emergency law gives the government the ability to order raw materials to keep the furnaces running, and to direct the company's workforce and board.",
      "The government has told the company's UK management to keep the site operational, and the new law will ensure that any employees who are sacked by the Chinese owners can be reinstated.",
      "Why is the Scunthorpe plant losing money?",
      "Jingye said the blast furnaces were \"no longer financially sustainable,\" blaming \"highly challenging\" market conditions, tariffs and costs associated with transitioning to lower-carbon production techniques.",
      "UK steel production has been falling for several decades and the financial pressures facing the industry were heightened in March when the US imposed a 25% tariff on any steel it imports.",
      "Global over-production of steel has created \"a glut of steel on the international market\", according to a UK government briefing on the industry, which has pushed prices down. British manufacturers also face higher costs, particularly on electricity, than elsewhere.",
      "Who else produces steel in the UK?",
      "There are 1,160 businesses in the UK steel industry, directly supporting 40,000 other firms across the country, according to government figures.",
      "Tata Steel at Port Talbot in Wales was once the UK's largest virgin steel producer but it turned off its blast furnace in September 2024, saying it was losing \u00a31.7m a day.",
      "An agreement with the UK government was reached which saw it commit \u00a3500m to help the company move to greener forms of steelmaking.",
      "Other steelmakers in the UK include Liberty Steel, Celsa, Marcegaglia and Outokumpu.",
      "Liberty Steel also has a plant in Scunthorpe which is facing closure. More than 120 jobs are at risk, with bosses blaming high energy costs.",
      "In 2023 the UK steel industry contributed \u00a32.3 billion to the UK economy -  equivalent to 0.1% of total UK economic output and 1.0% of manufacturing output.",
      "In the same year, the UK produced 5.6 million tonnes of crude steel, or 0.3% of the world's total. In comparison, China produced more than 1,000 million tonnes, 54% of global production.",
      "The EU produced 126 million tonnes of steel in 2023, 7% of the world's total. Compared with EU countries, the UK ranked as the eighth largest steel producer, after Germany, Italy, Spain, France, Austria, Poland and Belgium.",

      "The reason for my trip to Lincolnshire is because it is right at the heart of some of the big battles on 1 May.",
      "There are elections to the county council here, and to a new Greater Lincolnshire mayor.",
      "As one of the most pro-Brexit parts of the country during the referendum on leaving the EU almost a decade ago, and having elected a Reform UK MP in Boston and Skegness last year, it is perhaps no surprise to see Nigel Farage hoping for further breakthroughs here.",
      "Jaymey McIvor, a Reform councillor, told me his party was taking inspiration from Elon Musk's chainsaw-wielding cuts, promising \"a US Doge-style approach to the waste and dis-efficiency that we are seeing in all of our councils\".",
      "About an hour's drive north from here is Doncaster in south Yorkshire, where energy secretary Ed Miliband is an MP, and Labour is defending control of both the council and the mayoralty.",
      "An hour to the west is Nottinghamshire County Council, where elections will test support for Kemi Badenoch's Conservatives, currently clinging on in control but facing challenges from Labour, Reform and independents in what has often been a bellwether area.",
      "Head south from here and reach Cambridgeshire County Council, where Ed Davey hopes his Lib Dems can become the \"party of Middle England\" by turning their current coalition into a full majority, locking out the Tories.",
      "Steve Jarvis, Lib Dem group leader on Hertfordshire County Council, acknowledged his party was less strong these days in the north but was poised to make gains \"across the southern part of England\".",
      "And go east from Grantham and you'll find, well, nothing happening: Norfolk County Council was one of nine areas where elections were postponed while the government embarks on local government reorganisation, merging two-tier district and county councils into single unitary authorities.",

      "For most other nations, Donald Trump has paused implementing higher taxes on US imports for 90 days.",

      "The UK appeared to have come off lightly compared to other economies.",

      "The exact impact remains very uncertain. But some of the emerging fallout may have an upside - and here's why.",
      "Business",
      "Those most directly exposed in the UK to this trade war are British businesses - from carmakers to food producers - selling goods into the US.",
      "As American importers buying their products pay 10% more, they face a dilemma of whether to squeeze profits, share the pain across the supply chain or hope customers will be prepared to pay higher prices.",

      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Growth",
      "The blow to growth via trade will likely be less marked in the UK than elsewhere, in part because of what Britain sells to America.",
      "Two-thirds of British exports to the US are services - the likes of banking, insurance  and advertising - which aren't subject to tariffs. The UK's success in this area makes it a particular area of strength in its trade portfolio.",
      "But that strength can also be a weakness.",
      "Some services exports are linked to goods; think after-sales services or marketing. The demand for those could be affected by tariffs in the US.",
      "Sales of services exports could more broadly be impacted elsewhere if demand from other countries suffers.",
      "Some in the advertising industry are already fretting because spending on their services are often the first to suffer when there are budget cutbacks.",
      "And that trade success could be a vulnerability.",
      "The Bank of England notes that the size of the UK's export sector compared to the economy, and its financial sector, means it may be susceptible to risks to financial stability from weaker global growth.",
      "It's for all these reasons that Chancellor Rachel Reeves is warning that growth in the UK will be hit, even if we're now on a level playing field with other countries in terms of the 10% tariff.",
      "That's worrying, not just for households and businesses, but for the chancellor's own sums - weaker growth puts more of a strain on the public finances.",
      "That's why there's been speculation that we may see more tax rises come the Autumn Budget, if she's to stick to her fiscal rules.",
      "ISAs and pensions",
      "Compounding that dilemma, potentially, are movements in the bond markets.",
      "Those are usually seen as safe investments in times of strife but there have been signs of heavy selling, which could lead to higher borrowing costs for governments.",
      "And the wild swings in stock markets around the world, egged on by the heightened risk of global recession, have not been good news for investors in the UK.",
      "When share prices drop, they reduce the value of products such as ISAs and pension funds.",
      "But as seasoned analysts caution, those sorts of funds are long-term ones. Swings in the value of investments tend to get smoothed out over time - and most people aren't drawing from such funds day-to-day. On the whole, households here are less exposed to the stock market directly than those in America are.",
      "Interest rates",
      "There may be a silver lining to the market volatility.",
      "Prices of oil and commodities such as copper and sugar have been falling.",
      "That may bode well for lower inflation, as might the diversion of cheap goods from countries struggling to sell in the US.",
      "Against a backdrop of weaker growth, investors are speculating that the Bank of England may cut interest rates four more times this year, touting potential relief for millions of households.",
      "The Bank of England itself has noted that, in any case, British households are well placed to weather the storm - our debt relative to our incomes is at its lowest level since 2001.",
      "Moreover, the banking system, the Bank judges, is well placed to absorb shocks. Lessons from the 2008 financial crisis have been learnt.",

    "summary": "Countries break ten-year deadlock to agree measures to reduce commercial shipping emissions.",
    "story": [
      "Countries have agreed a global deal to tackle shipping emissions, after nearly ten years of negotiations.",
      "The agreement covers the vast majority of the world's commercial shipping and means that starting in 2028, ship owners will have to use increasingly cleaner fuels or face fines.",
      "The deal was nearly derailed after Saudi Arabia forced a last minute vote and the US pulled out of talks in London \u2013 but it eventually passed on Friday.",
      "Small island states and environmental groups were angry that a blanket tax was not  agreed to and called the deal \"unfit for purpose\".",
      "Shipping agrees net-zero goal but critics unmoved",
      "Clean energy's share of world's electricity reaches 40%, report says",
      "Shipping accounts for around 3% of global emissions. But unlike many other sectors it has struggled to reduce its carbon footprint over the last decade and is reliant on fossil fuels like diesel.",
      "But the agreement means it is now the first industry in the world with internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.",
      "The agreement was passed at the UN's International Maritime Organisation (IMO) meeting.",
      "It will require owners of large international vessels to increase their use of less carbon intensive fuels or face a penalty of up to $380 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions they emit from burning fuel.",
      "Although the final agreement was passed, it had to be put to a vote - an unusual move for UN bodies that usually agree measures by consensus.",
      "The vote was requested by Saudi Arabia, who did not support the agreement, and this position was shared by a dozen other oil-producing nations, including Russia.",
      "Although they opposed the proposal, they will be bound to implement it because they are members of the IMO.",
      "There have been moves to improve the efficiency of ships, but emissions have continued to increase in line with global trade - 90% of which is carried by ships.",
      "The most effective measure would be to switch ships away from fossil fuels to green fuels, but that would be very expensive.",
      "\"There is no fuel as cheap as diesel that ships use today because when we take crude oil out of the ground, we take out all the nice bits, that's the kerosene for aviation, diesel and petrol for cars,\" said Faig Abbasov, programme director for maritime transport at think tank Transport and Environment.",
      "\"Whatever is left at the bottom, that's what ships burn. So no fuel will be as cheap as this because not much energy goes into its production,\" he said.",
      "In comparison, the most environmentally friendly fuels like e-kerosene and ammonia are created from initially splitting water atoms to obtain hydrogen, which is a very energy-intensive and costly process.",
      "Figures vary depending on the fuel type but the World Economic Forum estimates that these green fuels are 3-4 times more expensive to produce.",
      "\"There's still a huge cost gap between the fossil fuels and the zero emission fuels and we need to close this gap. So you need carrots and sticks and in shipping the stick is not that big yet to use sustainable fuels,\" said Refke Gunnewijk, program manager for sustainable transport at the Port of Rotterdam.",
      "Some island states also abstained and said the deal was a watered down version of what they hoped for. An earlier proposal to apply a blanket carbon tax or levy - which would have been a world first - was dropped.",
      "\"Let us be clear about who has abandoned 1.5\u00b0C. Saudi Arabia, the US and fossil fuel allies pushed down the numbers to an untenable level and blocked progress at every turn,\" said Ralph Regenvanu, minister of energy and climate change for Vanuatu.",
      "Their disappointment was shared by environmental groups.",
      "\"This week, IMO member states squandered a golden opportunity for the global shipping sector to show the world how it can turn the tide on catastrophic climate heating, putting their own goals out of reach\", said Delaine McCullough, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition.",
      "It is estimated that the agreement could achieve an 8% reduction in emissions for the sector by 2030, according to the maritime consultancy UMAS. This would be short of the IMO's target agreed two years ago to cut emissions by 20% by the end of the decade.",
      "But China and Brazil had previously raised concerns that a levy could result in a significant price increase for basic goods like food. Both countries backed the final deal.",
      "Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum, said that the deal was a compromise.",
      "\"It is a difficult set of decisions, but it is the first regulation of its kind and that is to be celebrated,\" he said.",
      "Listen: How to clean up the shipping industry",
      "Listen: How to clean up the shipping industry",
      "Fahnestock added it was unclear if the penalties were enough to close the cost gap between the fuel types.",
      "\"You may have incentivised shipowners to prepare a bit for the future fuels but whether the signal is strong enough to get the billions of dollars of investment into the production facilities for these fuels - I don't think these regulations will overcome that. I think more will need to be done,\" he said.",
      "Any money raised from the penalties will be put into a \"Net Zero\" fund, with money spent on scaling up greener fuels and supporting developing countries.",
      "It is this \"redistribution\" that prompted the US delegation to pull out of the talks on Tuesday night. A letter was sent by the US to all countries at the IMO negotiations saying any levy would cause inflation and if it was passed then \"reciprocal measures\" would be taken.",
      "Although the US move was at odds with its long-held position at the IMO, it was in keeping with President Trump's push back on climate action seen over the last few months - such as withdrawing the US from the Paris Climate Agreement.",
      "But industry and country delegates appeared unperturbed when speaking to the BBC on Wednesday and continued with negotiations.",
      "The US only flags 178 cargo ships that represent 0.57% of worldwide commercial shipping tonnage. So if it took the decision not to implement the new proposals it is unlikely to make a significant difference to the funds raised.",

      "Two-year-old Henry is completely transfixed by the iPad in front of him. Every time a smiley face appears he taps the screen - and his tap transforms the face into a cartoon of a dancing animal.",
      "It looks like a simple, repetitive game, but is actually a test of a fundamental skill that is developing in the toddler's growing brain. Henry is wearing a sensor-laden cap with wires emerging from it that are attached to a large piece of analytical machinery. While Henry plays the game, the cap is scanning his brain activity and building up a picture of how well he can control his decision making.",
      "It is a test of inhibitory control, one of the skills scientists at the University of Bristol are measuring in babies and toddlers, as part of a mission to understand how and when very young children develop abilities that enable them to focus and learn.",
      "Scientists already know these skills are critical - but they don't yet know at what point they are established in an infant brain.",
      "The development of hundreds of children - from the age of six months to five years - is being tracked as they form the key skills that will shape their academic and social abilities.",
      "But what is really special about this pioneering project is that it is a human experiment within another decades-long human experiment. The mothers of 300 of the children being studied are themselves part of a project that has monitored their health since they too were babies, in the 1990s.",
      "A lifetime of data is being gathered that could reveal links between the brain development of the children being studied now and the health, experiences and genetics of their parents.",
      "For a study of child development, already having all this rich information about the parents is \"completely unique in the world\", lead researcher Dr Karla Holmboe says.",
      "\"We need to know when different skills develop and we need to understand how individual children develop over time.\"",
      "Children who are struggling when they start school tend to continue to struggle, Dr Holmboe explains.",
      "\"That can even continue into adulthood. So, there's this whole period of development that we need to understand so we can support children at a much younger age.\"",
      "During the study, young participants and their parents are invited to the university psychology lab to play scientific games and have their brain activity measured. Many have MRI scans at the ages of six months, three years and five years, generating a true picture of their young, developing brains.",
      "Key to the smiley face game Henry is playing is where that face appears on the iPad screen. Just as the toddler gets used to the face repeatedly popping up on the right side of his screen, it randomly starts appearing on the other side too.",
      "\"We're seeing if Henry can resist the urge to just keep tapping on the right,\" explains research assistant Carmel Brough, \"and instead look for where the smiley face is.\"",
      "This skill, explains Dr Holmboe, is critical when children start school.",
      "\"In a classroom, a child needs to be able to focus and not let their attention drift,\" she says. \"To learn new things, we need to be able to stop old habits.\"",
      "In another room, Jaxon, who is also aged two, is playing a game designed to test his working memory.",
      "A research assistant encourages him to watch as she puts stickers in different pots. The toddler is then asked to recall which pots contain stickers, and which do not. The motivating factor? Jaxon can keep all the stickers he finds.",
      "\"Working memory is when we need to keep a little bit of information in our head to solve a problem or do a task - like a puzzle, or even just remembering where we put something two minutes ago,\" explains Dr Holmboe. \"For children, you can imagine we need these skills when we learn maths or learn to read.",
      "\"These are what I call 'building blocks' of really important skills.\"",
      "The study will also assess language development and processing speed - a measure of how quickly children pick up new information.",
      "The Children of the 90s project is now 35 years old. Focused primarily on health, by tracking 14,500 children born between 1991 and 1992, it has revealed insights into obesity, autism and, more recently, the effect of the pandemic on mental health.",
      "The project's data has been made available to scientists around the world and has been cited in thousands of scientific papers.",
      "One study of the diets of children of the 90s provided evidence that, while a child's fussy eating is often worrying, it is unlikely to have any lasting impact on their health and development.",
      "Thanks to repeated health-screenings that have been key to the project, it also revealed that one in five young people shows signs of fatty liver disease, and one in 40 young people may have liver scarring - caused largely by obesity and alcohol consumption. This has shown just how common the condition is and provided insights into ways it can be prevented through diet.",
      "And the scientific revelations keep on coming. Last month, the study revealed that children who lacked oily fish in their diets were less sociable and kind.",
      "In this latest study \u2013 of the children of the children of the 90s \u2013 scientists are looking specifically at formative abilities and brain development. They will follow each child until they start school.",
      "Emily, who was studied as a child of the 90s, is Henry's mum. Today, her young son sits on her lap as he works on one of the research team's carefully designed puzzles.",
      "\"We've both been a part of this since birth,\" Emily says. \"It wasn't a choice for me at the start - my mum signed me up. But it is now, and I just think it's fascinating.\"",
      "Helping children to thrive in the future is the aim, Dr Holmboe says. Because when children start school, she explains \"a lot of things are already set.",
      "\"This is the groundwork that will help us support children at the right time.\"",
      "Henry and Jaxon finish their puzzles and games and take off their brain-scanning hats.",
      "\"My boys just love coming here,\" says Emily. \"They love all the toys - they get free snacks. So I'll continue coming just as long as they want to.",

    "summary": "The BBC finds evidence of fraud in the production of a \"green\" diesel meant to cut emissions.",
    "story": [
      "The UK government is investigating a fast-growing \"green fuel\" called HVO diesel amid claims of significant fraud, the BBC has learned.",
      "HVO is increasingly popular as a transport fuel and for powering music festivals and its backers say it can curb carbon emissions by up to 90% as it can be made from waste materials like used cooking oil.",
      "But industry whistleblowers told the BBC they believe large amounts of these materials are not waste but instead are virgin palm oil, which is being fraudulently relabelled.",
      "And data analysed by the BBC and shared with the UK's Department for Transport casts further doubt on one of the key ingredients in HVO, a material called palm sludge waste.",
      "Europe used more of this waste in HVO and other biofuels in 2023 than it is thought possible for the world to produce.",
      "In response to the BBC's findings, the Department for Transport said they \"take the concerns raised seriously and are working with stakeholders and international partners to gather further information\".",
      "HVO, or hydrotreated vegetable oil, has been called something of a wonder-fuel in recent years as it can be used as 100% substitute for diesel reducing planet warming emissions.",
      "UK consumption rocketed from 8 million litres in 2019 to about 699 million litres in 2024, according to provisional government figures.",
      "Its green credentials rely heavily on the assumption that it is made from waste sources, particularly used cooking oil or the waste sludge from palm oil production.",
      "But industry whistle-blowers have told the BBC that they believe virgin palm oil and other non-waste materials are often being used instead.",
      "That would be bad news for the planet, as virgin palm oil is linked to increased tropical deforestation, which adds to climate change and threatening endangered species like orang-utans.",
      "This palm oil \"floods the market like cancer,\" one large European biofuel manufacturer told the BBC.",
      "They said that to stay in business they have to go along with the pretence that they are using waste materials.",
      "Another whistle-blower, a former trader of these biofuels, also speaking anonymously, gave the BBC his account of one recent case dealing with supposedly waste products.",
      "\"I believe that what I bought was multiple cargos of virgin palm oil that has been wrongly classified as palm oil sludge,\" they said.",
      "\"I called one of the board members and told them about the situation, and then I was told that they didn't want to do anything about it, because the evidence would be burned.\"",
      "As well as this testimony, data compiled by campaign group Transport & Environment and analysed by the BBC suggests that more palm sludge waste is being used for transport biofuels than the world is probably able to produce.",
      "The figures show that the UK and EU used about two million tonnes of palm sludge waste for HVO and other biofuels in 2023, based on Eurostat and UK Department for Transport figures.",
      "EU imports of this sludge appear to have risen further in 2024, according to preliminary UN trade data, although the UK appears to have bucked this trend.",
      "But the data analysed by the BBC, which is based on well-established UN and industry statistics, suggests the world can only produce just over one million tonnes of palm sludge waste a year.",
      "This mismatch further suggests non-waste fuels such as  virgin palm oil are being used to meet Europe's rapid growth in biofuels, according to researchers and industry figures.",
      "\"It's a very easy game,\" said Dr Christian Bickert, a German farmer and editor with experience in biofuels, who believes that much of the HVO made with these waste products is \"fake\".",
      "\"Chemically, the sludge and the pure palm oil are absolutely the same because they come from the same plant, and also from the same production facilities in Indonesia,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"There's no paper which proves [the fraud], no paper at all, but the figures tell a clear story.\"",
      "Underpinning the sustainability claims of biofuels is an independent system of certification where producers have to show exactly where they get their raw materials from.",
      "It is mainly administered by a company called ISCC, and in Europe it has a long-standing reputation for ensuring that waste materials turned into fuel really do come from waste, by working with national authorities.",
      "But in Indonesia, Malaysia and China, three of the main sources of the raw ingredients claimed to be waste for HVO, supervision is much more difficult.",
      "\"ISCC is simply not allowed to send anybody to China,\" said Dr Christian Bickert.",
      "\"They have to rely on certification companies in China to check that everything is OK, but China doesn't allow any inspectors in from outside.\"",
      "This concern is echoed by several other groups contacted by the BBC.",
      "Construction giant Balfour Beatty, for example, has a policy of not using the fuel, citing sustainability concerns.",
      "\"We just are not able to get any level of visibility over the supply chain of HVO that would give us that level of assurance that this is truly a sustainable product,\" Balfour Beatty's Jo Gilroy told BBC News.",
      "The European Waste-based and Advanced Biofuels Association represents the major biofuel manufacturers in the EU and UK.",
      "In a statement they said \"there is a major certification verification issue that needs to be addressed as a matter of priority\", adding that the \"ISCC should do much more to ensure that non-EU Biodiesel is really what it claims to be\".",
      "In the light of growing fraud allegations, the Irish authorities have recently restricted incentives for fuels made from palm waste.",
      "The BBC also understands that the EU is about to propose a ban on ISCC certification of waste biofuels for two-and-a-half years, although it is expected to say it is not aware of direct breaches of renewable goals.",
      "It would then be up to individual member countries to decide whether to accept certifications.",
      "In response, the ISCC said it was \"more than surprised\" by the EU's move, adding that it had been \"a frontrunner in implementing the most strict and effective measures to ensure integrity and fraud prevention in the market for years\".",

      "The scan provides a new view of a boiler room, confirming eye-witness accounts that engineers worked right to the end to keep the ship's lights on.",
      "And a computer simulation also suggests that punctures in the hull the size of A4 pieces of paper led to the ship's demise.",
      "\"Titanic is the last surviving eyewitness to the disaster, and she still has stories to tell,\" said Parks Stephenson, a Titanic analyst.",

      "More than 700,000 images, taken from every angle, were used to create the \"digital twin\", which was revealed exclusively to the world by BBC News in 2023.",
      "Because the wreck is so large and lies in the gloom of the deep, exploring it with submersibles only shows tantalising snapshots. The scan, however, provides the first full view of the Titanic.",
      "The immense bow lies upright on the seafloor, almost as if the ship were continuing its voyage.",

      "Experts have been studying one of the Titanic's huge boiler rooms - it's easy to see on the scan because it sits at the rear of the bow section at the point where the ship broke in two.",
      "Passengers said that the lights were still on as the ship plunged beneath the waves.",
      "The digital replica shows that some of the boilers are concave, which suggests they were still operating as they were plunged into the water.",
      "Lying on the deck of the stern, a valve has also been discovered in an open position, indicating that steam was still flowing into the electricity generating system.",

      "A new simulation has also provided further insights into the sinking.",
      "It takes a detailed structural model of the ship, created from Titanic's blueprints, and also information about its speed, direction and position, to predict the damage that was caused as it hit the iceberg.",
      "\"We used advanced numerical algorithms, computational modelling and supercomputing capabilities to reconstruct the Titanic sinking,\" said Prof Jeom-Kee Paik, from University College London, who led the research.",
      "The simulation shows that as the ship made only a glancing blow against the iceberg it was left with a series of punctures running in a line along a narrow section of the hull.",
      "Titanic was supposed to be unsinkable, designed to stay afloat even if four of its watertight compartments flooded.",
      "But the simulation calculates the iceberg's damage was spread across six compartments.",
      "\"The difference between Titanic sinking and not sinking are down to the fine margins of holes about the size of a piece of paper,\" said Simon Benson, an associate lecturer in naval architecture at the University of Newcastle.",
      "\"But the problem is that those small holes are across a long length of the ship, so the flood water comes in slowly but surely into all of those holes, and then eventually the compartments are flooded over the top and the Titanic sinks.\"",
      "Unfortunately the damage cannot be seen on the scan as the lower section of the bow is hidden beneath the sediment.",
      "The human tragedy of the Titanic is still very much visible.",
      "Personal possessions from the ship's passengers are scattered across the sea floor.",
      "The scan is providing new clues about that cold night in 1912, but it will take experts years to fully scrutinise every detail of the 3D replica.",

      "Paleogeneticist Dr Nic Rawlence, also from Otago University, explained how ancient dire wolf DNA - extracted from fossilised remains - is too degraded and damaged to biologically copy or clone.",
      "\"Ancient DNA is like if you put fresh DNA in a 500 degree oven overnight,\" Dr Rawlence told BBC News. \"It comes out fragmented - like shards and dust.",
      "\"You can reconstruct [it], but it's not good enough to do anything else with.\"",
      "Instead, he added, the de-extinction team used new synthetic biology technology - using the ancient DNA to identify key segments of code that they could edit into the biological blueprint of a living animal, in this case a grey wolf.",
      "\"So what Colossal has produced is a grey wolf, but it has some dire wolf-like characteristics, like a larger skull and white fur,\" said Dr Rawlence. \"It's a hybrid.\"",
      "Dr Beth Shapiro, a biologist from Colossal Biosciences, said that this feat does represent de-extinction, which she described as recreating animals with the same characteristics.",
      "\"A grey wolf is the closest living relative of a dire wolf - they're genetically really similar - so we targeted DNA sequences that lead to dire wolf traits and then edited grey wolf cells... then we cloned those cells and created our dire wolves.\"",
      "According to Dr Rawlence though, dire wolves diverged from grey wolves anywhere between 2.5 to six million years ago.",
      "\"It's in a completely different genus to grey wolves,\" he said. \"Colossal compared the genomes of the dire wolf and the grey wolf, and from about 19,000 genes, they determined that 20 changes in 14 genes gave them a dire wolf.\"",
      "The edited embryos were implanted in surrogate domestic dog mothers. According to the article in Time, all three wolves were born by planned caesarean section to minimise the risk of complications.",
      "Colossal, which was valued at $10bn (\u00a37.8bn) in January, is keeping the wolves on a private 2,000-acre facility at an undisclosed location in the northern US.",
      "The pups certainly look like many people's vision of a dire wolf and the story has gathered global attention. So why is this scientific distinction important?",
      "\"Because extinction is still forever,\" Dr Rawlence told BBC News. \"If we don't have extinction, how are we going to learn from our mistakes?",

      "Clean energy's share of world's electricity reaches 40%, report says",
      "Shipping accounts for around 3% of global emissions. But unlike many other sectors it has struggled to reduce its carbon footprint over the last decade and is reliant on fossil fuels like diesel.",
      "But the agreement means it is now the first industry in the world with internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.",
      "The agreement was passed at the UN's International Maritime Organisation (IMO) meeting.",
      "It will require owners of large international vessels to increase their use of less carbon intensive fuels or face a penalty of up to $380 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions they emit from burning fuel.",
      "Although the final agreement was passed, it had to be put to a vote - an unusual move for UN bodies that usually agree measures by consensus.",
      "The vote was requested by Saudi Arabia, who did not support the agreement, and this position was shared by a dozen other oil-producing nations, including Russia.",
      "Although they opposed the proposal, they will be bound to implement it because they are members of the IMO.",
      "There have been moves to improve the efficiency of ships, but emissions have continued to increase in line with global trade - 90% of which is carried by ships.",
      "The most effective measure would be to switch ships away from fossil fuels to green fuels, but that would be very expensive.",
      "\"There is no fuel as cheap as diesel that ships use today because when we take crude oil out of the ground, we take out all the nice bits, that's the kerosene for aviation, diesel and petrol for cars,\" said Faig Abbasov, programme director for maritime transport at think tank Transport and Environment.",
      "\"Whatever is left at the bottom, that's what ships burn. So no fuel will be as cheap as this because not much energy goes into its production,\" he said.",
      "In comparison, the most environmentally friendly fuels like e-kerosene and ammonia are created from initially splitting water atoms to obtain hydrogen, which is a very energy-intensive and costly process.",
      "Figures vary depending on the fuel type but the World Economic Forum estimates that these green fuels are 3-4 times more expensive to produce.",
      "\"There's still a huge cost gap between the fossil fuels and the zero emission fuels and we need to close this gap. So you need carrots and sticks and in shipping the stick is not that big yet to use sustainable fuels,\" said Refke Gunnewijk, program manager for sustainable transport at the Port of Rotterdam.",
      "Some island states also abstained and said the deal was a watered down version of what they hoped for. An earlier proposal to apply a blanket carbon tax or levy - which would have been a world first - was dropped.",
      "\"Let us be clear about who has abandoned 1.5\u00b0C. Saudi Arabia, the US and fossil fuel allies pushed down the numbers to an untenable level and blocked progress at every turn,\" said Ralph Regenvanu, minister of energy and climate change for Vanuatu.",
      "Their disappointment was shared by environmental groups.",
      "\"This week, IMO member states squandered a golden opportunity for the global shipping sector to show the world how it can turn the tide on catastrophic climate heating, putting their own goals out of reach\", said Delaine McCullough, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition.",
      "It is estimated that the agreement could achieve an 8% reduction in emissions for the sector by 2030, according to the maritime consultancy UMAS. This would be short of the IMO's target agreed two years ago to cut emissions by 20% by the end of the decade.",
      "But China and Brazil had previously raised concerns that a levy could result in a significant price increase for basic goods like food. Both countries backed the final deal.",

      "Fahnestock added it was unclear if the penalties were enough to close the cost gap between the fuel types.",
      "\"You may have incentivised shipowners to prepare a bit for the future fuels but whether the signal is strong enough to get the billions of dollars of investment into the production facilities for these fuels - I don't think these regulations will overcome that. I think more will need to be done,\" he said.",
      "Any money raised from the penalties will be put into a \"Net Zero\" fund, with money spent on scaling up greener fuels and supporting developing countries.",
      "It is this \"redistribution\" that prompted the US delegation to pull out of the talks on Tuesday night. A letter was sent by the US to all countries at the IMO negotiations saying any levy would cause inflation and if it was passed then \"reciprocal measures\" would be taken.",

    "summary": "The BBC finds evidence of fraud in the production of a \"green\" diesel meant to cut emissions.",
    "story": [
      "The UK government is investigating a fast-growing \"green fuel\" called HVO diesel amid claims of significant fraud, the BBC has learned.",
      "HVO is increasingly popular as a transport fuel and for powering music festivals and its backers say it can curb carbon emissions by up to 90% as it can be made from waste materials like used cooking oil.",
      "But industry whistleblowers told the BBC they believe large amounts of these materials are not waste but instead are virgin palm oil, which is being fraudulently relabelled.",
      "And data analysed by the BBC and shared with the UK's Department for Transport casts further doubt on one of the key ingredients in HVO, a material called palm sludge waste.",
      "Europe used more of this waste in HVO and other biofuels in 2023 than it is thought possible for the world to produce.",
      "In response to the BBC's findings, the Department for Transport said they \"take the concerns raised seriously and are working with stakeholders and international partners to gather further information\".",
      "HVO, or hydrotreated vegetable oil, has been called something of a wonder-fuel in recent years as it can be used as 100% substitute for diesel reducing planet warming emissions.",
      "UK consumption rocketed from 8 million litres in 2019 to about 699 million litres in 2024, according to provisional government figures.",
      "Its green credentials rely heavily on the assumption that it is made from waste sources, particularly used cooking oil or the waste sludge from palm oil production.",
      "But industry whistle-blowers have told the BBC that they believe virgin palm oil and other non-waste materials are often being used instead.",
      "That would be bad news for the planet, as virgin palm oil is linked to increased tropical deforestation, which adds to climate change and threatening endangered species like orang-utans.",
      "This palm oil \"floods the market like cancer,\" one large European biofuel manufacturer told the BBC.",
      "They said that to stay in business they have to go along with the pretence that they are using waste materials.",
      "Another whistle-blower, a former trader of these biofuels, also speaking anonymously, gave the BBC his account of one recent case dealing with supposedly waste products.",
      "\"I believe that what I bought was multiple cargos of virgin palm oil that has been wrongly classified as palm oil sludge,\" they said.",
      "\"I called one of the board members and told them about the situation, and then I was told that they didn't want to do anything about it, because the evidence would be burned.\"",
      "As well as this testimony, data compiled by campaign group Transport & Environment and analysed by the BBC suggests that more palm sludge waste is being used for transport biofuels than the world is probably able to produce.",
      "The figures show that the UK and EU used about two million tonnes of palm sludge waste for HVO and other biofuels in 2023, based on Eurostat and UK Department for Transport figures.",
      "EU imports of this sludge appear to have risen further in 2024, according to preliminary UN trade data, although the UK appears to have bucked this trend.",
      "But the data analysed by the BBC, which is based on well-established UN and industry statistics, suggests the world can only produce just over one million tonnes of palm sludge waste a year.",
      "This mismatch further suggests non-waste fuels such as  virgin palm oil are being used to meet Europe's rapid growth in biofuels, according to researchers and industry figures.",
      "\"It's a very easy game,\" said Dr Christian Bickert, a German farmer and editor with experience in biofuels, who believes that much of the HVO made with these waste products is \"fake\".",
      "\"Chemically, the sludge and the pure palm oil are absolutely the same because they come from the same plant, and also from the same production facilities in Indonesia,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"There's no paper which proves [the fraud], no paper at all, but the figures tell a clear story.\"",
      "Underpinning the sustainability claims of biofuels is an independent system of certification where producers have to show exactly where they get their raw materials from.",
      "It is mainly administered by a company called ISCC, and in Europe it has a long-standing reputation for ensuring that waste materials turned into fuel really do come from waste, by working with national authorities.",
      "But in Indonesia, Malaysia and China, three of the main sources of the raw ingredients claimed to be waste for HVO, supervision is much more difficult.",
      "\"ISCC is simply not allowed to send anybody to China,\" said Dr Christian Bickert.",
      "\"They have to rely on certification companies in China to check that everything is OK, but China doesn't allow any inspectors in from outside.\"",
      "This concern is echoed by several other groups contacted by the BBC.",
      "Construction giant Balfour Beatty, for example, has a policy of not using the fuel, citing sustainability concerns.",
      "\"We just are not able to get any level of visibility over the supply chain of HVO that would give us that level of assurance that this is truly a sustainable product,\" Balfour Beatty's Jo Gilroy told BBC News.",
      "The European Waste-based and Advanced Biofuels Association represents the major biofuel manufacturers in the EU and UK.",
      "In a statement they said \"there is a major certification verification issue that needs to be addressed as a matter of priority\", adding that the \"ISCC should do much more to ensure that non-EU Biodiesel is really what it claims to be\".",
      "In the light of growing fraud allegations, the Irish authorities have recently restricted incentives for fuels made from palm waste.",
      "The BBC also understands that the EU is about to propose a ban on ISCC certification of waste biofuels for two-and-a-half years, although it is expected to say it is not aware of direct breaches of renewable goals.",
      "It would then be up to individual member countries to decide whether to accept certifications.",
      "In response, the ISCC said it was \"more than surprised\" by the EU's move, adding that it had been \"a frontrunner in implementing the most strict and effective measures to ensure integrity and fraud prevention in the market for years\".",

      "\"Solar power has become the engine of the global energy transition,\" said Phil Macdonald, the managing director of Ember.",
      "\"Amid the noise, it's essential to focus on the real signal. Hotter weather drove the fossil generation increase in 2024, but we're very unlikely to see a similar jump in 2025.\"",

      "Back to the 1940s",
      "The report says that clean energy sources contributed more than 40% of global electricity generation for the first time since the 1940s. Back then demand was much lower, and hydroelectric power stations contributed a significant share.",
      "The big picture is that the rise in the global demand for electricity continues to outpace the growth in renewable energy.",
      "That means that though the percentage generated by clean power has risen to 40.9% the amount of greenhouse gases being emitted has yet to start falling.",
      "According to the Ember report global demand for electricity rose by 4% in 2024.",
      "This was partly due to an increased use of air conditioning in what was a particularly hot year. That meant that fossil fuel generation, mostly coal (34%) and gas (22%), increased by 1.4% and global emissions of the climate warming gas CO2 rose to an all time high of 14.6bn tonnes.",

    "story": [
      "The world's most popular gadgets - phones, laptops, tablets, smartwatches - could be about to get a lot more expensive in the US.",
      "Many of them are made in China, which now faces a 145% tariff on its goods imported to the US, under President Donald Trump's controversial trade policy.",
      "The effect this may have on the iPhone and its maker Apple is under the spotlight - with some analysts saying if costs are passed onto consumers, iPhone prices in the US could rise by hundreds of dollars.",
      "And if the tariffs impact the value of the dollar, it could become more expensive to import iPhones and other devices around the world - potentially leading to higher prices in UK shops.",
      "Ben Wood of CCS Insight told the BBC that if tariffs remain in place, Apple may raise iPhone prices globally when the next iteration is launched.",
      "\"It is unlikely the company would want to have differentiated pricing globally,\" he said - as the tech giant would want to avoid people buying the device cheaply in the UK and selling it on for profit in the US.",
      "Though others say they believe it could result in cheaper prices if firms which normally send their goods to the US instead send them to countries which don't have such steep tariffs, like the UK.",
      "And there may be a significant change if the cost of tariffs is passed onto consumers globally - longer contracts to spread out the cost of the device.",
      "While a phone contract may typically last two years, Mr Wood said some firms already offer four year deals, and he believed \"we might see five-year contracts\" in 2025.",
      "\"One could argue it is almost like having a mortgage for your smartphone,\" he said.",
      "Where are iPhones made?",
      "The US is a major market for iPhones and Apple accounted for more than half of its smartphones sales last year, according to Counterpoint Research.",
      "It says as much as 80% of Apple's iPhones intended for US sale are made in China, with the remaining 20% made in India.",
      "Along with fellow smartphone giants such as Samsung, Apple has been trying to diversify its supply chains to avoid over-reliance on China in recent years.",

      "As tariffs took effect, Apple reportedly looked to speed up and increase its production of India-produced devices in recent days.",
      "Reuters reported on Thursday that Apple chartered cargo flights to ship more than 600 tons of iPhones from India to the US.",
      "Amid Trump's 90-day pause on tariffs, including those levied on India, the country may be set to benefit from an iPhone manufacturing boost.",
      "The BBC has approached Apple for comment on the impact of tariffs on their operations and prices, but has not had any response yet.",
      "How exposed is Apple to tariffs?",
      "Trump and his advisors have said the aim of its tariffs are to encourage more US manufacturing.",
      "However, the tech industry relies on a global network of suppliers for product components and assembly.",
      "This, and finding skilled workers to match the fast pace and low cost of production in Asia, means relocating supply chains is no simple feat.",
      "Apple committed a $500bn (\u00a3385bn) investment in the US in February - which the Trump administration believes will result in more homegrown manufacturing.",
      "But Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said shifting parts of its supply chain from cheaper manufacturing hubs in Asia to the US will take a lot of time, and money.",

      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Will iPhone prices go up?",
      "Apple have not revealed yet whether they plan to pass on the costs of the tariffs onto consumers in the US and increase prices.",
      "Some analysts believe Apple is in a more fortunate position than others, having reaped more money from its products than it has spent on making them.",
      "\"As a company with lucrative margins on its devices, Apple can absorb some of the tariff-induced cost increases without significant financial impact, at least in the short term,\" says Forrester principal analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee.",
      "But he notes the company's strong branding and popularity may allow it to pass some costs to consumers without too much backlash.",
      "\"The brand commands better loyalty than its competitors, and it is unlikely that a manageable price increase will send these customers fleeing into the arms of Android-based competitors.\"",
      "Some estimates suggest iPhone prices in the US could as much as triple if costs were passed to consumers.",
      "Following Trump's tariff increase on China to 125%, the cost for a China-made iPhone 16 Pro Max with 256GB storage would have surged from $1,199 to $1,999, according to estimates by investment banking firm UBS.",
      "They estimate a less significant increase on the iPhone 16 Pro 128GB storage - which is made in India - by five percent from $999 to $1046.",
      "While some analysts such as Dan Ives have suggested that the cost of a \"Made in USA\" iPhone could soar to as much as $3500.",
      "What can consumers do about it?",
      "There's still plenty of uncertainty about what happens next, and how companies like Apple will respond to tariffs remains to be seen.",
      "This hasn't stopped some US customers reportedly rushing to Apple stores to buy its smartphones.",
      "The BBC spoke to shoppers outside an Apple Store in New York who had bought products in fear of a potential price hike.",

      "CCS Insight estimates that 5.5m second-hand smartphones will be sold in the UK in 2025, representing 29.7% of the total market.",
      "The iPhone remains one of the most expensive smartphones on the market - and brands such as Google and Samsung offer phones with similar features at a lower cost.",
      "The other option, and perhaps the most cost-effective, could be for people to skip upgrades to newer iPhone models and look to slightly older, cheaper versions.",
      "\"The path of least resistance would be to keep the smartphone they already have for longer,\" said Mr Wood.",

    "summary": "The UK government sought to keep details of its row with Apple over requested access to its encrypted cloud storage tool private.",
    "story": [
      "A judge has sided with a coalition of civil liberties groups and news organisations - including the BBC - and ruled a legal row between the UK government and Apple over data privacy cannot be held in secret.",
      "The Home Office wants the right to be able access information secured by Apple's Advanced Data Protection (ADP) system, citing powers given to it under the Investigatory Powers Act.",
      "At the moment Apple has no such capability - such data can only be accessed by the user - and says it does not want to create what it calls a \"backdoor\" into ADP because of concerns it would eventually be exploited by hackers and criminals.",
      "The government's request prompted fierce criticism from privacy campaigners and some US politicians.",
      "In February, Apple pulled ADP from the UK and in March it launched legal proceedings against the government, in a case which is being heard by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal.",
      "The government argued it would damage national security if the nature of the legal action and the parties to it were made public - what are known as the \"bare details of the case\".",
      "In a ruling published on Monday morning, the tribunal rejected that request - pointing to the extensive media reporting of the row and highlighting the legal principle of open justice.",
      "\"It would have been a truly extraordinary step to conduct a hearing entirely in secret without any public revelation of the fact that a hearing was taking place,\" it states.",
      "\"For the reasons that are set out in our private judgement, we do not accept that the revelation of the bare details of the case would be damaging to the public interest or prejudicial to national security,\" it later adds.",
      "In a statement the Home Office said it would not comment on legal proceedings or individual notices but said its \"first priority is to keep people safe.\"",
      "\"There are longstanding and targeted investigatory powers that allow the authorities to investigate terrorists, paedophiles and the most serious criminals and they are subject to robust safeguards including judicial authorisations and oversight to protect people's privacy,\" it added.",
      "It stressed it was not seeking blanket data access - and any requests to view individual accounts protected by ADP would need a court approved warrant.",
      "Wider implications",
      "Civil and digital rights organisations in the UK, which criticised the Home Office request, have welcomed Monday's ruling.",
      "They, along with news organisations  - including the BBC - made legal representations for the case to be heard in public.",
      "\"This is bigger than the UK and Apple,\" said Jim Killock, executive director of Open Rights Group.",
      "\"The Court's judgment will have implications for the privacy and security of millions of people around the world.\"",
      "The Open Rights Group campaigned alongside Big Brother Watch and Index on Censorship against the proposal to hold the hearing in secret.",
      "Big Brother Watch interim director Rebecca Vincent says the judgement is \"effectively chipping away at the pervasive climate of secrecy surrounding the Investigatory Powers Tribunal's consideration of the Apple case\".",
      "\"The Home Office's order to break encryption represents a massive attack on the privacy rights of millions of British Apple users, which is a matter of significant public interest and must not be considered behind closed doors,\" she adds.",

      "\"As we have said many times before we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will.\"",
      "How does ADP work?",
      "ADP is an opt-in data security tool designed to provide users of devices such as iPhones with a more secure way to protect data such as photos and notes stored in their iCloud accounts.",
      "It uses what is known as end-to-end encryption (E2EE), meaning only the user has the \"key\" necessary to unscramble and access the data.",
      "E2EE is also used to protect data on messaging services including WhatsApp and Signal.",
      "It makes the data very secure - but poses a problem for law enforcement agencies.",

      "The Indian government is keen to attract such investment, hoping it will raise standards in the footwear industry and boost exports.",

      "\"This is the dream scenario for tech investors,\" Dan Ives, who is the global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities,  posted on X. \"Smartphones, chips being excluded is a game-changer scenario when it comes to China tariffs.\"",

      "But on Wednesday he announced he would implement a 90-day pause for countries hit by higher US tariffs - except China, whose tariffs he raised to 145%.",
      "Trump said the tariff increase for China was because of the country's readiness to retaliate with its own 84% levy on US goods.",

      "However,  she could potentially still face charges when she leaves office next year and loses her presidential immunity.",

      "The investigation began after a news report drew attention to luxury watches she wore at public events.",

    "story": [
      "More than three million children around the world are thought to have died in 2022 as a result of infections that are resistant to antibiotics, according to a study by two leading experts in child health.",
      "Children in Africa and South East Asia were found to be most at risk.",
      "Antimicrobial resistance - known as AMR - develops when the microbes that cause infections evolve in such a way that antibiotic drugs no longer work.",
      "It has been identified as one of the biggest public health threats facing the world's population.",
      "A new study now reveals the toll that AMR is taking on children.",
      "Using data from multiple sources, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank, the report's authors have calculated there were more than three million child deaths in 2022 linked to drug-resistant infections.",
      "Drug-resistant infections killing millions - study",
      "Scientists discover new part of the immune system",
      "Experts say this new study highlights a more than tenfold increase in AMR-related infections in children in just three years.",
      "The number could have been made worse by the impact of the Covid pandemic.",
      "Increased use of antibiotics",
      "Antibiotics are used to treat or prevent a huge range of bacterial infections - everything from skin infections to pneumonia.",
      "They are also sometimes given as a precaution to prevent, rather than treat, an infection - for example if someone is having an operation or receiving chemotherapy treatment for cancer.",
      "Antibiotics have no impact on viral infections, though - illnesses such as the common cold, flu or Covid.",
      "But some bacteria have now evolved resistance to some drugs, due to their overuse and inappropriate use, while the production of new antibiotics  - a lengthy and costly process - has slowed right down.",
      "The report's lead authors, Doctor Yanhong Jessika Hu of Murdoch Children's Research Institute in Australia and Professor Herb Harwell of the Clinton Health Access Initiative, point to a significant growth in the use of antibiotics that are meant to only be held back for the most serious infections.",
      "Between 2019 and 2021 the use of \"watch antibiotics\", drugs with a high risk of resistance, increased by 160% in South East Asia and 126% in Africa.",
      "Over the same period, \"reserve antibiotics\" -  last-resort treatments for severe, multidrug-resistant infections - rose by 45% in South East Asia and 125% in Africa.",
      "Dwindling options",
      "The authors warn that if bacteria develop resistance to these antibiotics, there will be few, if any, alternatives for treating multidrug-resistant infections.",
      "Prof Harwell is presenting the findings at the Congress of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases in Vienna later this month.",
      "\"AMR is a global problem. It affects everyone. We did this work really to focus on the disproportionate way in which AMR affects children,\" he said ahead of the event.",
      "\"We estimate three million deaths of children worldwide associated with antimicrobial resistance.\"",
      "Is there a solution to AMR?",
      "The WHO describes AMR as one of the most serious global health threats we face, but speaking from Vienna, Prof Harwell warns that there are no easy answers.",
      "\"It's a multi-faceted problem that extends into all aspects of medicine and really, human life,\" he said.",
      "\"Antibiotics are ubiquitous around us, they end up in our food and the environment and so coming up with a single solution is not easy.\"",
      "The best way to avoid a resistant infection is to avoid infection altogether, which means higher levels of immunisation, water sanitation and hygiene are needed, he adds.",
      "\"There's going to be more antibiotics use because there's more people who need them, but we need to make sure that they are used appropriately and the correct medicines are used.\"",
      "Dr Lindsey Edwards, a senior lecturer in microbiology at King's College London, said the new study \"marks a significant and alarming increase compared to previous data\".",
      "\"These findings should serve as a wake-up call for global health leaders. Without decisive action, AMR could undermine decades of progress in child health, particularly in the world's most vulnerable regions.\"",

      "President Donald Trump pulled the US out of a previous nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers in 2018, and has long said he would make a \"better\" deal.",
      "The talks are seen as an important first step in establishing whether a deal can be done.",
      "At two-and-a-half hours, the first meeting was brief, reportedly respectful - and set the stage for a second round.",
      "That was probably as good as it could get when Iranian and US officials sat down in Muscat, the capital of Oman - whose top diplomat mediated the primarily indirect negotiations.",
      "They were the most significant talks since Trump pulled the US out of the Iran nuclear deal of 2015 during his first term in office.",
      "The verdict of Iran's lead negotiator, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, was positive.",

      "This meeting ran with the delegations in separate rooms, relaying messages through Oman's foreign minister, Badr bin Hamad al-Busaidi.",
      "Witkoff, who is leading the US delegation, had previously only spoken of meeting face-to-face.",

      "Iran, mindful of pressure from hardliners at home, underlined how limited their face-to-face exchange was, with no photographs taken.",
      "In a statement following the talks, the White House said the discussions \"were very positive and constructive\", noting that Witkoff had emphasised to Iran that he had instructions to resolve the adversaries' \"differences through dialogue and diplomacy, if that is possible\".",
      "\"These issues are very complicated, and special envoy Witkoff's direct communication today was a step forward in achieving a mutually beneficial outcome,\" the statement added.",
      "Araghchi had said ahead of the discussions that his country wanted a \"fair agreement\".",
      "After the talks concluded, he said discussions next week may not happen in Oman, but would still be mediated by the Middle Eastern nation. The White House said they would take place next Saturday.",
      "\"Neither we, nor the other party, want fruitless negotiations, discussions for discussions' sake, time wasting or talks that drag on forever,\" Araghchi told Iranian state television.",

      "An unnamed source in Oman told news agency Reuters that the talks would seek to de-escalate regional tensions and secure prisoner exchanges.",
      "Trump revealed the talks would take place during a visit by Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House on Monday. The Israeli prime minister said on Tuesday that both leaders had agreed that Iran \"will not have nuclear weapons\".",
      "Netanyahu has called for a \"Libya-style deal\", referring to the north African nation completely dismantling its weapons programme in an agreement reached with Western powers in 2003. That would be completely unacceptable to Iran.",
      "Iran insists its nuclear activities are entirely peaceful and that it will never seek to develop or acquire nuclear weapons.",
      "Iranian officials have made it clear the negotiations will focus only on its nuclear programme, not its broader defence capability, such as its ballistic missile programme.",
      "Ahead of the talks, Trump said on Friday that he wanted Iran \"to be a wonderful, great, happy country - but they can't have nuclear weapons\".",

      "Erik and Lyle were convicted of killing their parents in their Beverly Hills mansion in 1989, a notorious case that still divides Americans. They are currently serving life in prison without the possibility of parole in California.",
      "Friday's ruling means a pair of high-profile hearings next week to decide whether the convicted killers will be resentenced,  will continue.",
      "Los Angeles District Attorney Nathan Hochman has voiced fierce opposition to resentencing the pair, after his predecessor put the process in motion just before the November election.",
      "The brothers' effort is based on a California law that allows certain inmates who were aged under 26 at the time of their crimes to seek resentencing and potential parole eligibility - recognising that brain development continues into a person's mid-20s.",
      "If the brothers are resentenced to 50 years to life as they have requested, it would make them immediately eligible for parole.",

This is the outcome Los Angeles District Attorney Nathan Hochman is pushing for, arguing the brothers have not fully accepted responsibility for their crimes and therefore don't qualify for a reduced sentence.",
      "Alternatively, the court could side with former DA George Gasc\u00f3n's earlier recommendation and resentence the brothers to 50 years to life. This would make them immediately eligible for parole, as they've already served more than 30 years. But eligibility doesn't guarantee release; they would still need to convince a parole board they are no longer a danger to society.",
      "Another possibility is that the judge opts for a modified sentence that reduces their punishment but does not immediately open the door to parole. In that case, the brothers could face several more years behind bars before becoming eligible.",
      "The resentencing bid is one of three routes the brothers have been chasing in recent months in hopes of being freed.",

      "Depending on the results, the governor could grant clemency, commuting their sentences to make them eligible for parole or even releasing them outright.",

    "story": [
      "US TV institution Saturday Night Live has entertained viewers and created comedy stars for 50 years. Can a British version reach the same heights?",
      "For five decades, the phrase \"Live from New York, it's Saturday night!\" has boldly opened episodes of Saturday Night Live, with its tried and tested mix of topical sketch comedy, celebrity cameos and big-name musical guests.",
      "Now, the stateside staple is to come live from London after Sky announced that a \"star-studded\" UK spin-off, fronted by British comedic talent, will launch next year.",
      "Overseen by the US original show's creator Lorne Michaels, now 80, the broadcaster is promising the same \"live, fast-paced style\" as its American cousin.",
      "Comedy heritage",
      "Since being launched by Michaels in 1975, SNL has been a livewire springboard for comedic talents like Bill Murray, Eddie Murphy, Tina Fey, Will Ferrell and Mike Myers.",
      "Famed for its ever-revolving cast, Joe Piscopo of the 1980s cohort summed it up in a documentary marking the show's 50th anniversary: \"They took sketch comedy to a whole other level,\" he said. \"Comedy slowly became rock 'n' roll.\"",
      "The unpredictable live premise, combined with its longevity, has helped maintain its status. No other show has been nominated for (331) or won (90) more Emmy Awards.",
      "\"I don't think you can underestimate that heritage when accounting for its current success,\" says the Guardian's TV and comedy writer Rachel Aroesti. \"Which is something the UK version obviously won't be able to emulate.\"",
      "The heritage is one reason why the show still attracts major young stars like Timothee Chalamet, who grew up watching it even as linear TV audiences have dropped sharply in the streaming age.",
      "\"In the US, the guests' involvement is often newsworthy in itself - they also know their presence will generate a lot of publicity, so it's a win-win situation,\" Aroesti adds.",
      "\"I would be surprised if the UK version is able to attract the same calibre of guest.\"",
      "'Courageous' move",
      "The Atlantic writer Helen Lewis says the general industry reaction has been that commissioning a UK version is a \"courageous\" move - wishing the team luck with the \"difficult proposition\".",
      "There are some notable differences between the two transatlantic TV industries.",
      "The US SNL budget will be far bigger than UK TV norm, paying for a large cast and a team of writers working to the wire to keep jokes current.",
      "\"In the American version, it's a very expensive format, having a writers' room and keeping a cast of actors on retainer, essentially, the whole time. That's really expensive,\" Lewis told BBC Radio 4's PM programme.",
      "The US comedy culture is also different, Lewis believes.",
      "\"The humour can sometimes be much more slapsticky. Quite a lot of the time, Americans struggle with British humour because they think we're extremely mean.\"",
      "Comedy writer Jack Bernhardt agrees that there are different comedic traditions. UK sketch groups often form through friendships and showcase their talent at the Edinburgh Fringe, whereas many US comedians train at improv and sketch clubs, specifically honing their skills for shows like SNL.",
      "Bernhardt says these differences \"can't necessarily be fixed by commissioning the UK version of SNL - it's an entire comedy culture that would need to shift\".",
      "\"That's not to say one can't do the other,\" he adds. \"Just that this version of a sketch show isn't necessarily playing to the unique strengths of the UK comedy scene. And that's even before we get into the difficulties of doing a live show.\"",
      "Given these challenges, importing a legacy brand name like SNL may seem a gamble, especially at a time when the UK TV industry is faltering.",
      "However, the US show's fortunes have held relatively firm this decade, even if ratings are well below the pre-streaming era.",
      "Vulture found that SNL averages 8.4 million weekly viewers, outperforming all other late-night shows combined. It's also US network TV's top entertainment series among adults aged 18 to 49.",
      "\"You rarely hear anyone asking whether SNL will 'survive', only how once Michaels moves on,\" wrote reporter Josef Adalian. \"Linear TV may be fighting for its life, yet SNL seems safe.\"",
      "Crucially, the sketch format lends itself perfectly to social media age, being easily digestible on digital platforms. According to the Economist, online SNL clips are averaging about 216 million views per episode on TikTok, X and YouTube. Sure, these viewers are not watching live, but the content undoubtedly lives.",
      "Previous attempts to translate US late-night shows to the UK have often struggled.",
      "However, in the 1980s, Saturday Live - later renamed Friday Night Live - ran for four seasons and helped the careers of Ben Elton, Harry Enfield, Stephen Fry and Rik Mayall, while Channel 4's The 11 O'Clock Show gave breaks to Ricky Gervais and Sacha Baron Cohen.",
      "British comedy producer Jimmy Mulville, whose company Hat Trick Productions has made shows including Have I Got News For You and Whose Line is it Anyway?, says the opportunity to develop new talent will be one of the key draws for Sky, despite the risks.",
      "\"If Sky get this right, they'll create new stars, and from that they can spin-off other shows with those performers,\" he explains. \"These shows can be fantastic, they can go on for years, and they can show off new talent all the time.\"",
      "He says the producers will need to assemble the right team of writers and performers.",
      "\"If it's well-produced, I've no reason to see why it shouldn't be successful,\" says Mulville, who co-hosts Insiders: The TV Podcast.",
      "He recently took the BBC's long-running topical panel show Have I Got News For You to the US, where it has been commissioned for a second season by CNN. One US talent agent warned that the show was \"too British\" to work across the pond, he recalls.",
      "\"I said, 'Yes it is, but I'm going to get it written by Americans and performed by Americans for Americans'.\"",
      "The reverse will be true for SNL. \"In the UK, you're going to have it written by British writers with British performers for a British audience. So it's not an American show any more.\"",
      "Indeed, being \"live from London\" won't be enough on its own to succeed, and SNL UK will need to feel like a truly British comedy creation and not just a reheated imitation of an American hit.",

    "summary": "India\u2019s obesity crisis is surging - and the humble pot belly may be a bigger villain than it seems.",
    "story": [
      "The Indian pot belly - once a badge of prosperity, indulgence and aging respectability - has long been a target of satire and social commentary.",
      "In literature, it quietly signalled comfort or complacency; in films, it became a shorthand for the lazy official, gluttonous uncle, or a corrupt policeman. Cartoons exaggerated it to mock politicians. In rural settings, it was once considered a status symbol - a sign that \"this man eats well\".",
      "But what was once dismissed or even celebrated is now raising alarm bells. The obesity crisis in India is ballooning - and the seemingly harmless pot belly may be a far bigger villain than we think.",
      "India had the second-highest number of overweight or obese adults in 2021, with 180 million affected - behind only China. A new Lancet study warns this number could soar to 450 million by 2050, nearly a third of the country's projected population.",
      "Globally, more than half of all adults and a third of children and adolescents are expected to face the same fate.",
      "At the heart of this issue in India lies the pot belly, or in medical terms, abdominal obesity.",
      "This form of obesity refers to the accumulation of excess fat around the belly and doctors say it's more than a cosmetic concern. As far back as the 1990s, studies showed a clear link between belly fat and chronic conditions like Type 2 diabetes and heart disease.",
      "Obesity isn't just abdominal. It appears in different patterns, depending on fat distribution: peripheral obesity affects the hips, thighs, and buttocks, while generalised obesity involves fat spread more evenly across the body.",
      "The numbers on abdominal obesity in India are already troubling. According to the latest National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) -  which, for the first time, measured waist and hip sizes - about 40% of women and 12% of men in India have abdominal obesity.",
      "Abdominal obesity, based on Indian guidelines, means a waist over 90cm (35 inches) for men and 80cm (31 inches) for women. Among women aged 30 to 49, nearly one in two already show signs of it. Urban populations were found to be more affected than rural ones, with high waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratios emerging as a key red flag.",
      "Indians are getting fatter - and it's a big problemWhy are Indian children getting fatter?",
      "Indians are getting fatter - and it's a big problem",
      "Why are Indian children getting fatter?",
      "So why is belly fat such a big deal?",
      "One reason is insulin resistance - a condition where the body stops responding properly to insulin, the hormone that helps regulate blood sugar. Abdominal fat disrupts how the body uses insulin, making it harder to control blood sugar.",
      "Studies have found South Asians, including Indians, tend to have more body fat than white Caucasians at the same Body Mass Index. (BMI is a simple measure of body fat based on a person's weight in relation to their height.)",
      "It's not just how much fat you have - it's where it goes. In South Asians, fat tends to collect around the trunk and under the skin, but not always deep in the abdomen as visceral fat.",
      "Though South Asians may have less of the more harmful deep abdominal fat around organs like the liver and pancreas, studies show their larger, less efficient fat cells struggle to store fat under the skin. As a result, excess fat spills into vital organs that regulate metabolism - like the liver and pancreas - raising the risk of diabetes and heart disease.",
      "Scientists still don't fully understand the biological reasons behind the fat distribution patterns. Though numerous genetic studies have been conducted, no single gene has consistently explained this tendency.",
      "One theory offers an evolutionary root. India, for centuries, was wracked by famines and chronic food shortages, leaving generations to survive on meagre nutrition.",
      "In such conditions, the human body adapted for survival in extreme scarcity.",
      "The body needed a depot for this energy and the abdomen, being the most expandable area, became the prime storage site. Over time, as food became more plentiful, this fat store continued to grow -  eventually to harmful levels.",
      "\"It's a conjectural but plausible evolutionary theory - one that can't be proven, but makes sense,\" says Anoop Misra, who heads Delhi's Fortis-C-DOC Centre of Excellence for Diabetes, Metabolic Diseases and Endocrinology.",
      "Last year, in a paper doctors belonging to the Indian Obesity Commission redefined obesity guidelines for Asian Indians, moving beyond BMI to better reflect how body fat relates to early health risks.",
      "They created a two-stage clinical system that considers fat distribution, related diseases and physical function.",
      "Stage one involves a high BMI, but without abdominal obesity, metabolic disease, or physical dysfunction. In such cases, lifestyle changes like diet, exercise and sometimes medication are usually enough.",
      "Stage two includes abdominal obesity - the harmful visceral fat -  and is often accompanied by health issues like diabetes, knee pain or palpitations. This stage signals higher risk and calls for more intensive management.",
      "This classification guides treatment intensity. Once belly fat appears, early action is key - new weight loss drugs like semaglutide and tirzepatide are proving effective at targeting it, doctors say.",
      "\"As shocking as it may sound, even people with a normal weight can have dangerous levels of belly fat,\" says Dr Misra.",
      "Indian physicians say abdominal obesity is rising due to lifestyle changes - more junk food, takeaways, instant meals and greasy home cooking. Between 2009 and 2019, Cameroon, India and Vietnam saw the fastest growth in per capita sales of ultra-processed foods and beverages, studies found.",
      "So, what needs to be done?",
      "Experts say Indians need tougher lifestyle changes than Western norms recommend. While 150 minutes of weekly exercise may suffice for their European men, their South Asians counterparts need around 250\u2013300 minutes to offset slower metabolism and less efficient fat storage, studies show.",
      "\"Our bodies simply aren't as good at handling excess fat,\" says Dr Misra.",
      "In short, the pot belly isn't just a punchline - it's a warning sign. And India is sitting on a ticking health time bomb.",

      "Friday was Omri's birthday. His second in captivity. As he turns 48, somewhere in the tunnels of Gaza, Lishay will be writing again, with tales of two daughters who were still babies when he last saw them.",
      "Released hostages say Omri was seen alive last July. Lishay's belief in her husband's survival seems unshakeable, but this is the toughest time of the year.

      "Along with a merchandise stall to support the families and a \"virtual reality hostage experience\", it's all part of a collective effort to keep the plight of the missing in the public eye and maintain political pressure on the Israeli government.",
      "Lishay and her daughters have yet to return to the house where family life was blown apart in a few traumatic hours, 18 months ago.",

    "story": [
      "When F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote \"The Great Gatsby\" at the height of the roaring '20s, he couldn't possibly realize that the book would emerge as one of the very top contenders for \"the great American novel.\"",
      "In fact, when Fitzgerald \u2013 a St. Paul, Minnesota native whose debut novel \"This Side of Paradise\" launched him into national prominence at the age of 24 \u2013 died in 1940 at the early age of 44, the book was already in danger of falling into obscurity.",
      "Now, 100 years after the book's first publication on April 10, 1925, it endures as one of the country's foremost tales of American hubris, modern yearning and class consciousness. And its clear-eyed assessment of the attainability of the American dream remains incisive with each passing decade.",
      "Fitzgerald's book, long a staple in high school literature classes, tells the story of Nick Carraway, a Midwesterner (and veiled Fitzgerald stand-in) who becomes enamored with the bon vivant, Jazz Age lifestyle on Long Island, specifically the effects of mutli-millioniare Jay Gatsby.",
      "Like Carraway, Gatsby is a Midwesterner who has trekked to the East Coast to make a name for himself. It's Carraway's cousin Daisy Buchanan who serves as the catalyst for Gatsby's downfall, and ultimately Carraway's own disillusionment. All the while, a symbolic green light beckons from the distance.",
      "When the book was first published, reviews were largely positive, though not unanimous. Fitzgerald, who originally wanted to title the book \"Trimalchio in West Egg\" before being persuaded to go with a title he thought far more generic, watched as the book languished on the vine commercially, selling fewer than 25,000 copies in the initial push.",
      "He would only complete one further novel in his lifetime: 1934's \"Tender is the Night,\" a thinly-veiled roman \u00e0 clef of Fitzgerald's own marriage to socialite Zelda Sayre, detailing their mutual descent into alcoholism and mental illness. Fitzgerald's early death from a heart attack was likely fuelled by years and years of alcohol abuse. Ironically, he'd gone sober just ahead of the cardiac event.",
      "If \"The Great Gatsby\" never achieved the level of esteem it now enjoys during the author's own life, it wasn't long after his death that Fitgerald's literary reputation took off.",
      "When the Modern Library asked authors, historians, critics and publishers on the eve of Y2K to rank their picks for the world's best novels of the 20th century, it was \"The Great Gatsby\" that\u00a0stood above all other U.S. contenders near the top of the poll. (The novel landed in second place, bookended by Irish author James Joyce's \"Ulysses\" and \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" in the top three.)",
      "The novel has since launched multiple film adaptations, has been transposed to the stage, and since going into the public domain in 2021, has been the subject of an endless array of reimaginings, remixes and mashups. It's even cleared space around itself as a modern-day meme, in the form of an animated .GIF depicting Leonardo Dicaprio (playing Gatsby in Baz Luhrmann's 2013 film adaptation) smirking as he offers a champagne toast flanked by ostentatious fireworks.",
      "Host of \"Gatsby\" centennial events planned in New York, Minnesota",
      "A host of \"Gatsby\"-themed events are planned to mark the novel's centennial anniversary. In New York, the Empire State Building announced plans to light up in green in a nod to the novel's symbolic green light at the end of Tom and Daisy's dock.",
      "There was also a rowdy \"Roaring Twenties\" party at the Empire Steak House in New York, which was an opulent opera house in Fitzgerald's era. Billed as the \"nation's most extravagant celebration,\" the event featured live jazz, period dancing, and speeches from officials with the New York Public Library.",
      "In honor of the legendary stage play, Broadway has marked the occasion with a release of new block tickets for the show. Tickets are on sale now and will run through Jan. 4, 2026.",
      "The iconic Victorian-themed New York bar, Oscar Wilde, is also hosting a Gatsby-inspired soir\u00e9e on Saturday. The event information markets the celebration as \"an all-day affair of music, opulence and mischief.\" Events kick off at 2 p.m. and continue into the evening until 11 p.m.",
      "Additionally, multiple restaurants are offering exclusive discounts on cocktails, and even a free drink at some places. Gatsby's Landing, Nothing Really Matters, Angelina Bakery and The Plaza are all listed as participants. All events and discounts are ongoing throughout the month of April.",
      "In Fitzgerald's hometown of St. Paul, the events include a new exhibit of the author's life and times at the Minnesota History Center, as well as various, less-than-sober events leaning into the novel's party-friendly Prohibition-era setting.",
      "If you managed to get through high school without having been assigned to read the book, there are a number of live readings of the book scheduled this month, including at St. Paul's Gale Family Library.",

But it means that as I get older, there's more wiggle room and acceptance for her flaws and mine.\"",

      "In 2019, there were 1,274 confirmed measles cases.",

      "\"The ultimate goal is for all Americans to have access to crisis care for mental health and substance use issues, in the way that 911 provides rapid response for physical health emergencies,\" SAMHSA told CBS News in a statement. \"The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration is working diligently to support the development and sustainability of local treatment and support connected to 988, including the expansion of mobile crisis services and 24/7 walk-in crisis care clinics across the country.

      "Morris said additional cuts could lead to \"a very dire situation.\"",

      "Because of past fraud by rogue brokers, some Affordable Care Act policyholders may get an unexpected tax bill this season.",
      "But that isn't the only potential shock. Other changes coming soon - stemming from proposals by the administration of President Donald Trump - could affect their coverage and its cost. And sorting out related problems and challenges may take longer as federal workers are laid off and funding for assistance programs is cut.",
      "First up: taxes",
      "Tax season is when some consumers learn they were fraudulently enrolled in an ACA plan or switched to a different one without their knowledge.",
      "Those unauthorized enrollments or changes took off in late 2023 and continued through last year, drawing more than 274,000 complaints in the first eight months of 2024 to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, mostly about rogue agents or call centers.",
      "Tax problems can arise if those enrollments resulted in premium tax credits exceeding the amount the consumer should have received. In those cases, consumers may have to pay all or part of those credits back. The amount owed could range from a few hundred dollars to thousands, with some caps based on income.",
      "The first clue some people have is when they get a 1095-A form in the mail.",
      "Those documents are sent out by the state and federal marketplaces to the IRS and ACA enrollees, showing any tax credit payments made to health insurers on a taxpayer's behalf. Taxpayers use the premium tax credit information from the 1095-A when completing their return.",
      "Returns can be held up if the IRS has information indicating the taxpayer has ACA coverage that they failed to report on their return, or if there are other discrepancies.",
      "The Biden administration last year took steps to slow the fraudulent switching, including requiring a three-way call between the broker, client, and marketplace for some enrollment issues.",
      "\"While we may be seeing less [fraud], we're still dealing with 2024 taxes,\" said Erin Kinard, director of systems and intake for the Health and Economic Opportunity Program at Pisgah Legal Services, a nonprofit serving western North Carolina that offers both legal help and assistance with ACA problems.",
      "Consumers who suspect they were fraudulently enrolled should immediately call their federal or state ACA marketplace, experts say. Some consumers will be referred to special federal caseworkers throught he marketplaces. But some of those caseworkers are now part of the broad reduction in force by theTrump administration.",
      "In recent days, \"they laid off two divisions on the Affordable Care Act side,\" said Jeffrey Grant, who oversaw ACA issues as CMS' deputy director for operations in the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight before leaving in February.",

Other consumers have found they were enrolled even though they had affordable employer coverage, making them ineligible for ACA subsidies.",
      "That's what happened to Anthony Akra and his wife, Ashley Zukoski, in Charlotte, North Carolina. They were enrolled in a plan without their knowledge in 2023, by a broker in Florida with whom they had never spoken. The couple had health insurance through Zukoski's employer. The broker listed an income that qualified the household for a large subsidy that fully offset the monthly premium cost, so the couple never received a bill. One day, a 1095-A form showed up in their mailbox.",
      "\"I didn't know what the hell it was,\" said Akra, who said the form showed that he had been receiving hundreds of dollars a month in premium tax credits.",
      "He would owe a big chunk of that back unless he could get the plan retroactively canceled. Because their pharmacy, part of a national chain, had switched them to the new plan, also without telling them, they had used the new coverage every time they filled a prescription. That inadvertent use of the policy complicated their efforts to get the fraudulent coverage revoked.",
      "Meanwhile, the IRS withheld more than $4,000 from their tax refund based on the information sent through that 1095-A form.\u00a0 Months passed, but with assistance from a \"navigator\" program \u2014 a government-fundednonprofit that helps people deal with insurance problems \u2014 they were able to get the incorrectinsurance canceled and a refund at the end of October.",
      "It is not unusual for people to spend weeks or even months trying to sort out the mess, said Kinard, whose organization is similar to the one that helped Akra.",
      "While navigator programs nationwide are still operating to help people sign up for health coverage or address issues, the Trump administration has targeted their funding for a 90% cut. Meanwhile, ACA enrollees may face a range of other surprises due to policy and budget steps proposed by the Trump administration.",
      "More Potential Changes",
      "Congress must decide whether to extend premium tax credits that were enhanced during the covid pandemic, which expanded eligibility for the credits and made them larger for many enrollees. Keeping them in place would be expensive, with the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation estimating it would add $335 billion to the deficit through 2034.",
      "That debate will come amid another deficit-affecting decision: whether to extend tax cuts enacted during the first Trump administration, which would add trillions to the budget deficit through 2034.",
      "If the enhanced subsidies are not renewed, monthly premium costs would rise by an average of over 75%, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. Premiums could more than double in some states, including many GOP-led ones, such as Texas, Mississippi, Utah, Wyoming, and West Virginia.",
      "That could spark a political backlash. Additionally, the enhanced subsidies are seen as a main reason for strong enrollment growth, leading to more than 24 million people signing up for ACA plans for this year.",
      "A recent KFF study found the 15 states with the most enrollment growth since 2020 were all won by Trump in 2024.",
      "A proposed rule released last month by the Trump administration includes provisions to shorten the annual enrollment period, get rid of a special open enrollment period that allows low-income people to sign up year-round, and require stricter verification of income and other information when people apply for coverage. The administration says most of these steps are needed to reduce fraud in the system.",
      "The administration estimates that 750,000 to 2 million fewer people would enroll in coverage as a result of the changes.",
      "The new rule, if finalized, will make it harder for people to enroll, said Xonjenese Jacobs, director of Florida Covering Kids & Families at the University of South Florida College of Public Health. Losing the year-round enrollment for very low-income people, for example, would affect people short on cash who move often to stay with relatives or friends, and those who have unsteady employment, making it hard to know when or where to enroll and what their income might be in the coming year.",
      "\"They don't have the same ability to plan,\" Jacobs said. \"It's definitely going to make a difference for a lot of the individuals that we service.\""

    "summary": "The redeployment comes after another unvaccinated child died in the measles outbreak in Texas.",
    "story": [
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has begun redeploying staff to respond to the deadly outbreak of measles in Texas, a spokesperson said Monday, a week after steep layoffs at the agency impacted its response to the spread of the virus.",
      "\"A team of three deployed yesterday to meet with county and state officials to assess the immediate needs to respond to this outbreak. The team is meeting with officials again today,\" CDC spokesperson Jason McDonald said in an email.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. first said Sunday that the CDC would be redeploying to Texas at its governor's request, after another unvaccinated child died in the measles outbreak. An 8-year-old girl was the second fatality there this year.",
      "\"Once the assessment is complete, more CDC staff will be sent to Texas per Sec. Kennedy's order and the governor's request. The first teams deployed to Texas arrived on March and returned to CDC on April 1,\" McDonald said.",
      "Multiple agency staff working on the CDC's measles response were among the thousands cut from the agency last week, officials have told CBS News.",
      "A handful of employees at agencies within the department have been brought back to work so far, multiple officials said, at least through the end of the 60 day period before their layoff notices formally take effect.",
      "McDonald did not comment on whether laid-off staff who had been working on the agency's measles response would be among those Kennedy might reinstate.",
      "The ongoing outbreak in Texas and neighboring states has driven this year's tally of U.S. measles cases to the highest levels seen since a large wave of cases in 2019, which was the worst in the U.S. in decades.",
      "While dozens of measles cases are reported every year, usually linked to undervaccinated travelers returning from trips outside the country, health authorities have warned that ongoing community spread of the virus this year is now threatening America's status of having eliminated endemic spread of the virus.",
      "There have been six measles outbreaks so far this year, a CDC spokesperson told CBS News on Friday. The outbreak in Texas and neighboring states makes up the majority of cases. Smaller outbreaks are also ongoing in New Jersey, Georgia, Ohio and Kansas.",
      "Details of the sixth outbreak have not yet been released, the spokesperson said, citing patient privacy.",
      "Kennedy calls vaccine \"most effective way\" to stop measles spread",
      "While in Texas, Kennedy also posted on X that the \"most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.\" The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps and rubella, and is normally given in two doses in early childhood.",
      "Kennedy's range of statements about the measles vaccine in recent weeks have drawn scrutiny from health experts, including after a Fox News interview in which he falsely inflated the shot's risks.",
      "In a later post, Kennedy also said he had met with \"two extraordinary healers\" who he said have \"healed some 300 measles-stricken Mennonite children using aerosolized budesonide and clarithromycin.\"",
      "Budesonide can sometimes help to treat respiratory illnesses, reducing inflammation in the lungs, said pediatrics professor Dr. James Campbell of the University of Maryland in an email in March. CBS News reached out to Campbell after Kennedy previously hailed \"miraculous and instantaneous recovery\" from use of these treatments.",
      "\"In 2025, we should not have to treat measles in the US because it is completely preventable, but of course, like all preventable diseases, we do,\" said Campbell.",
      "Campbell is vice chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee that develops recommendations for treating measles and other infectious diseases.",
      "Clarithromycin, an antibacterial drug, has no effect on viruses like measles but can be used by doctors to treat coinfections from some bacterial pneumonias that sometimes develop in infected children, Campbell said. However, it does not work for all bacteria.",
      "\"These choices should be made on an individual basis by the doctors, not as sweeping recommendations for all children with measles,\" said Campbell. He said that the drugs don't have evidence proving they should be used as routine treatments for measles and cautioned against \"sweeping statements about how those singular choices related to treatment of measles in general.\"",
      "\"Vaccination will prevent measles, but for those who do get measles, rigorous studies, and not anecdotal reports, will help us to better treat them,\" said Campbell.",
      "Kennedy's embrace of alternative therapies has been contradicted by other health experts, including former Trump administration officials.",
      "\"My children and grandchildren will not die of measles, because they are vaccinated.\u00a0 And there is no substitute, nor any effective treatment, for measles,\" Dr. Brett Giroir, an adviser to the department this year, wrote in an opinion piece published by RealClearHealth last week.",
      "The editorial from Giroir, who previously worked as assistant secretary of health during President Trump's first term, was published before news of the second child to die in the Texas measles outbreak. In the U.S., a child last died from measles in 2015.",
      "\"One child's death from measles is a tragedy not only for the family and their community but also for our nation.\u00a0 If we can't stop measles, really what can we do?\u00a0 Let's not wait for another tragedy,\" Giroir said.",

    "summary": "Some people whose homes survived the Eaton wildfire in January are struggling to convince their insurers to test their properties for safety.",
    "story": [
      "All sense of survivors' guilt was fleeting for those residents whose homes remained standing after wildfires ripped through the Los Angeles area three months ago.",
      "Many worried that smoke from the Eaton wildfire that destroyed more than 9,000 structures and killed 18 people may have carried toxins, including lead, asbestos and heavy metals, into their homes. But they struggled to convince their insurers to test their properties to ensure it was safe to return.",
      "Nicole Maccalla, a data scientist, said embers burned more than half of her roof, several windows and eaves were damaged, and her house in Altadena was left filled with ash, debris, soot and damaged appliances. She said her insurance adjuster said USAA would pay for contamination testing, but after choosing a company and coming back with the results, her claim was rejected. The adjuster said the company only covered testing in homes with major damage.",
      "\"Every single item is a battle,\" said Maccalla. \"It's denials and appeals and denials and appeals, and you wait weeks and weeks and weeks for responses.\"",
      "Maccalla and others banded together as Eaton Fire Residents United, sharing indoor environmental testing data and compiling the results in an online map. Of 81 homes tested so far for lead, all show elevated levels, according to the group.",
      "\"I've already had multiple people reach out and say: 'Thank you for publishing this map \u2026 because my insurance company has changed their mind and approved testing,'\" said Maccalla, who helped design the data collection to verify results and maintain privacy.",
      "Many homeowners paid privately for the testing after their insurance companies refused, revealing gaps in coverage. The group hopes the data will help residents who can't afford it to convince their insurers to cover testing and remediation.",
      "\"If I can prove my community is not fit for human habitation then maybe I can show my home won't be,\" said Jane Lawton Potelle, founder of Eaton Fire Residents United.",
      "It's not easy to understand how and when it is safe to return home, Potelle said. The fine print of insurance policies can be frustrating and confusing, and the government has not stepped in to help.",
      "No help from FEMA",
      "The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it has no plans to conduct widespread environmental testing. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health is tracking environmental testing largely by academic researchers and a handful from government agencies, but most studies assess outdoor contamination.",
      "Reports from other urban wildfires, in which building materials, appliances, cars and more burn at incredibly high temperatures, show increased levels of heavy metals including lead and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as benzene that are tied to negative health risks. But insurance companies haven't standardized testing for those contaminants.",
      "Home insurance broadly covers fire damage, but there is a growing dispute over what damage must be covered when flames don't torch the property.",
      "California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara released a bulletin in March that put the onus on companies to properly investigate reported smoke damage, saying they cannot deny such claims without investigating thoroughly, including paying for professional testing as warranted. But many residents have been left to fight for coverage anyway.",
      "Janet Ruiz, spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute that represents many major insurance companies, said it's hard to compare neighbors because every claim is unique due to each home's physical structure, actual damage and defined insurance coverage limits.",
      "\"It can vary and insurance companies are sensitive to what the claim is,\" Ruiz said. \"You have to work with your insurance companies and be reasonable about what may have happened.\"",
      "Disputes over fire damage coverage",
      "Dave Jones, director of the Climate Risk Initiative at University of California, Berkeley, and former state insurance commissioner, said testing should be covered even though some insurance companies disagree.",
      "\"It's perfectly reasonable for people to have some kind of environmental test done so that their home is safe and their property is safe,\" Jones said. \"We're talking about very catastrophically high temperature fires where all sorts of materials are melted and some of them become toxic.\"",
      "The state's insurer of last resort, known as the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, has been scrutinized for years over how it handles smoke damage claims. A 2017 change to the FAIR Plan limited coverage to \"permanent physical changes,\" meaning smoke damage must be visible or detectable without lab testing for claims to be approved. State officials said that threshold was too high and illegal, and ordered a change.",
      "Dylan Schaffer, an attorney leading a class action lawsuit challenging FAIR Plan's threshold, said he was surprised private carriers are disputing similar fire damage claims.",
      "\"The damage is not due to smoke, the damage is contamination from fire,\" Schaffer said. \"They make it complicated because it saves them money.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Altadena residents on the FAIR Plan say their claims are still being denied. Jones believes the debate will only end when lawmakers take action.",
      "FAIR Plan spokeswoman Hilary McLean declined to comment on the ongoing litigation and individual cases, but said the FAIR Plan pays all covered claims based on the adjusters' recommendations.",
      "\"Our policy, like many others, requires direct physical loss for there to be coverage,\" McLean said.",
      "Potelle said the first inkling that her house might be toxic came after meeting with her AAA insurance adjuster in the days after the fire. Even though she had worn a mask, her chest still ached and her voice rasped, and she wondered whether her home was safe for her 11-year-old.",
      "Stephanie Wilcox said her toddler's pediatrician recommended testing their home. Her Farmers Insurance policy includes coverage for lead and asbestos in addition to her wildfire coverage, but after multiple denials, she paid out of pocket.",
      "\"After the initial inspection, (Farmers) had told us remediation would cost about $12,000 and that it would be habitable, like we could move back in tomorrow,\" she said. \"But now there's no way.\"",
      "She plans to ask for a new estimate including lead abatement and other costs, citing the results.",
      "Similarly, Zach Bailey asked in late January for contamination testing. The house he shares with his wife and toddler sits in an island of largely spared homes among blocks wiped out by the fire. After months of denials, State Farm agreed to pay for lead and asbestos testing because the remediation company cited federal worker safety regulations.",
      "It shouldn't have been that hard, he said.",
      "\"It feels like the insurance companies should have a playbook at this point,\" he said. \"They should have a process to keep people safe because this isn't the first disaster like this.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 11 Apr 2025 17:06:23 -0400",
    "summary": "U.S. businesses are starting to add a tariff fee to customer bills and shopping carts to offset rising import costs.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's volley of tariffs has U.S. companies scrambling for ways to absorb \u2014 and if possible avoid \u2014 the added business costs.",
      "Some enterprises, from small businesses to nationally recognized brands, have already announced higher prices, citing President Trump's tariffs. While others, from footwear companies to furniture brands, are warning consumers to brace for increased costs to come.",
      "Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told\u00a0CNBC\u00a0Thursday that he expects the tariffs to lead to higher prices on a host of consumers goods, noting that the site's third-party sellers are likely to pass on tariff-related costs.",
      "Some consumers are also preparing for price hikes by\u00a0stocking up on goods\u00a0they think are likely to become more expensive if U.S. \"reciprocal levies\" on dozens of countries,\u00a0which are paused for 90 days, take effect.",
      "A 10% tariff on all U.S. imports remains in place. China, which accounts for nearly a third of all goods imported into the U.S., faces levies of up to 145% for some items. In an escalation of the trade war between the world's two largest economics, Beijing fired back Friday by announcing it will hike duties on American exports from 84% to 125% and deriding Mr. Trump's tariffs as a \"joke.\"",
      "Tariff fees on what you buy",
      "Although the tariffs and retaliatory moves by other countries have yet to hit economic growth, U.S. businesses aren't waiting around. Some are introducing \"tariff surcharges,\" announcing new prices on their websites and in letters to consumers.",
      "Labucq, which sells high-end footwear that is fabricated in Italy, addressed tariffs and their effect on pricing in a recent social media\u00a0post. The company said a 20% U.S. tariff on imports from the European Union, which Mr. Trump announced on April 2 before pausing them, would require the company to hike prices by 10% beginning April 15. Labucq said its pricing will then jump by an additional roughly 10% on May 7, noting the increases are necessary for it to \"remain sustainable.\"",
      "Dame, a sexual wellness brand that makes adult toys and personal care products, has implemented a $5 \"Trump tariff surcharge\" that is automatically added to customers' online shopping carts at checkout.",
      "Dame CEO Alexandra Fine said the fee doesn't cover all of its extra costs and that the company is analyzing its pricing given that most of its products are made in China. \"Our whole industry is in China, so we've already seen the impact,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Fine also said she wants to be transparent with customers about what is happening, rather than quietly inflating prices.",
      "\"The intention of adding the Trump tariff surcharge as a line item at checkout was to remind people that this is an extra tax on us. I wanted people to understand why it's more expensive \u2014 that it's because of political decisions that were made,\" she said.",
      "Other companies are also moving to raise prices. In a quarterly earnings call last month, a senior executive with U.S. chip maker Micron said some of its products would be subject to higher U.S. tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China and that it plans to \"pass those costs along to our customers.\"",
      "Honeywell Building Automation, which designs safety and efficiency systems for buildings, in early March announced new pricing related to fresh tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. The company started applying a 6.4% \"tariff surcharge\" on its building management systems, excluding software and subscription services, saying the move was necessary \"to mitigate the impact of tariffs.\" Honeywell also said it would eliminate the extra duty \"as soon as such tariffs are no longer in force.\"",
      "Lemonade out of lemons",
      "Other companies are using the situation as a promotional tool. While it's true that consumers could eventually pay more if they wait to purchase furniture, electronics, automobiles and more, \"pre-tariff sales\" play into consumers' fear that prices could rise, and can be an effective way to boost sales, according to experts.",
      "\"The tariffs are injecting uncertainty into the marketplace and when there is high uncertainty, consumers tend to overestimate their losses, so they try to hedge their losses as much as possible in a very irrational way,\" Denish Shah, professor of marketing at Georgia State University's Robinson College of Business, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "And in times of market uncertainty, explains Denish, consumers are prone to panic-buying.",
      "\"They tend to stockpile necessities, fearing that tomorrow, suddenly, prices could go up. So they'll say, 'Let me try to accelerate all the purchases I can that I would have made anyway,'\" he said.",
      "That said, consumers' overarching goal, particularly after battling years of relentless inflation, is to save money. \"Consumers are very price-sensitive in this environment, so they are going to react very strongly to sales that companies are promoting,\" Shah added.",
      "The pre-tariff sales strategy is already working for some sellers, such as Burlap & Barrel, a spice company that imports single-origin spices from around the world. It sources ingredients from small farms in Guatemala, Iceland, India, Spain, Turkey, Vietnam and more. Over the weekend, the spice importer announced\u00a0a \"spring cleaning-turned-impromptu Tariff sale,\" marking down all products by 20%, through Tuesday.",
      "\"When we planned this sale, we thought it'd be a routine springtime promotion, but in the last few days it has turned into something very, very different,\" Burlap & Barrel wrote in a social media post. The company said that it's waiting to see how tariffs are applied to its products, but it's sure that they \"will be bad for our business,\" given that it cannot easily overhaul its supply chains.",
      "The company states that it is running the sale \"To show that we're serious about not raising our prices, and to finance another year or purchasing from smallholder farmers in the face of economic instability and political crisis.\"",
      "Another company, Freewrite, sent an email to customers on Friday urging them to buy its digital typewriters before it hikes prices on its China-made products next week due to the tariffs.",
      "\"Everyone, including our contract manufacturing partners, is helping us explore our options, but the truth is that it is incredibly difficult to move factories. It takes careful planning, huge expense and much more time than we have,\" Freewrite CEO Adam Leeb wrote in the email. \"On Monday, we will be raising prices. Not because we want to, but because we have to.\"",
      "Large chains are putting their own spin on tariff-related promotions. Furniture maker Raymour & Flanigan is urging customers to \"lock in pre-tariff pricing\" in a banner on its website. The company does not indicate what kind of price hikes it could implement in the future, though, as a result of the new levies.",

    "story": [
      "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the U.S. economy faces a critical stretch, while also warning of the ongoing uncertainty caused by President Trump's tariff policies.",
      "\"The economy is facing considerable turbulence (including geopolitics), with the potential positives of tax reform and deregulation and the potential negatives of tariffs and 'trade wars,' ongoing sticky inflation, high fiscal deficits and still rather high asset prices and volatility,\" he said Friday during the banking giant's first-quarter earnings call.",
      "Dimon told Wall Street analysts that JPMorgan expects tariffs to increase inflation roughly 0.5% this year. But he also expressed confidence that the Trump administration is eager to negotiate trade agreements with other countries, which would ease the strain on the economy.",
      "\"I would like to see the administration negotiate trade deals. I think that will be good for everybody, and they want to do it, too,\" he said.",
      "Dimon, considered the country's most influential banking leader, said earlier this week that U.S. tariffs could lead to higher inflation, weaker economic growth and potentially even a recession.",
      "\"Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth,\" he said in his annual shareholder letter Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump this week\u00a0paused most country-based tariffs\u00a0for 90 days \u2014 a move that came as CEOs and Wall Street investors publicly pressed the White House to reconsider its trade measures and as financial markets gave a resounding thumb's down to U.S. trade policies.",
      "After suspending the \"reciprocal\" tariffs, Mr. Trump said he had watched an interview with Dimon on Fox Business in which the banker said the tariffs would make a recession a \"likely outcome,\" according to Bloomberg.",
      "Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, CEO of Pershing Square, also decried the tariffs this week,\u00a0saying\u00a0on social media Sunday that \"we are in the process of destroying confidence in our country as a trading partner, as a place to do business, and as a market to invest capital.\"",
      "JPMorgan Chase earnings",
      "JPMorgan also reported first-quarter earnings on Friday that beat Wall Street expectations.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-hhs-poverty-levels-medicaid-benefits/",
    "published": "Fri, 11 Apr 2025 12:27:10 -0400",
    "summary": "Recent cuts eliminated a small, specialized workforce that sets the poverty standards determining who is eligible for Medicaid as well as assistance with food, home heating, child care, and more.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's firings at the Department of Health and Human Services included the entire office that sets federal poverty guidelines, which determine whether tens of millions of Americans are eligible for health programs such as Medicaid, food assistance, child care, and other services, former staff said.",
      "The small team, with technical data expertise, worked out of HHS' Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, or ASPE. Their dismissal mirrored others across HHS, which came without warning and left officials puzzled as to why they were \"RIF'ed\" \u2014 as in \"reduction in force,\" the bureaucratic language used to describe the firings.",
      "\"I suspect they RIF'ed offices that had the word 'data' or 'statistics' in them,\" said one of the laid-off employees, a social scientist whom KFF Health News agreed not to name because the person feared further recrimination. \"It was random, as far as we can tell.\"",
      "Among those fired was Kendall Swenson, who had led development of the poverty guidelines for many years and was considered the repository of knowledge on the issue, according to the social scientist and two academics who have worked with the HHS team.",
      "The sacking of the office could lead to cuts in assistance to low-income families next year unless the Trump administration restores the positions or moves its duties elsewhere, said Robin Ghertner, the fired director of the Division of Data and Technical Analysis, which had overseen the guidelines.",
      "The poverty guidelines are \"needed by many people and programs,\" said Timothy Smeeding, a professor emeritus of economics at the La Follette School of Public Affairs at the University of Wisconsin. \"If you're thinking of someone you fired who should be rehired, Swenson would be a no-brainer,\" he added.",
      "Under a 1981 appropriations bill, HHS is required annually to take Census Bureau poverty-line figures, adjust them for inflation, and create guidelines that agencies and states use to determine who is eligible for various types of help.",
      "There's a special sauce for creating the guidelines that includes adjustments and calculations, Ghertner said. Swenson and three other staff members would independently prepare the numbers and quality-check them together before they were issued each January.",
      "Everyone in Ghertner's office was told last week, without warning, that they were being put on administrative leave until June 1, when their employment would officially end, he said.",
      "\"There's literally no one in the government who knows how to calculate the guidelines,\" he said. \"And because we're all locked out of our computers, we can't teach anyone how to calculate them.\"",
      "ASPE had about 140 staff members and now has about 40, according to a former staffer. The HHS shake-up merged the office with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ, whose staff has shrunk from 275 to about 80, according to a former AHRQ official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "HHS has said it laid off about 10,000 employees and that, combined with other moves, including a program to encourage early retirements, its workforce has been reduced by about 20,000. But the agency has not detailed where it made the cuts or identified specific employees it fired.",
      "\"These workers were told they couldn't come into their offices so there's no transfer of knowledge,\" said Wendell Primus, who worked at ASPE during the Bill Clinton administration. \"They had no time to train anyone, transfer data, etc.\"",
      "HHS defended the firings. The department merged AHRQ and ASPE \"as part of Secretary Kennedy's vision to streamline HHS to better serve Americans,\"\u00a0 spokesperson Emily Hilliard said. \"Critical programs within ASPE will continue in this new office\" and \"HHS will continue to comply with statutory requirements,\" she said in a written response to KFF Health News.",
      "After this article published, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon called KFF Health News to say others at HHS could do the work of the RIF'ed data analysis team, which had nine members. \"The idea that this will come to a halt is totally incorrect,\" he said. \"Eighty million people will not be affected.\"",
      "Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has so far declined to testify about the staff reductions before congressional committees that oversee much of his agency. On April 9, a delegation of 10 Democratic members of Congress waited fruitlessly for a meeting in the agency's lobby.",
      "The group was led by House Energy and Commerce health subcommittee ranking member Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), who told reporters afterward that Kennedy must appear before the committee \"and tell us what his plan is for keeping America healthy and for stopping these devastating cuts.\"",
      "Matt VanHyfte, a spokesperson for the Republican committee leadership, said HHS officials would meet with bipartisan committee staff on April 11 to discuss the firings and other policy issues.",
      "ASPE serves as a think tank for the HHS secretary, said Primus, who later was Rep. Nancy Pelosi's senior health policy adviser for 18 years. In addition to the poverty guidelines, the office maps out how much Medicaid money goes to each state and reviews all regulations developed by HHS agencies.",
      "\"These HHS staffing cuts \u2014 20,000 \u2014 obviously they are completely nuts,\" Primus said. \"These were not decisions made by Kennedy or staff at HHS. They are being made at the White House. There's no rhyme or reasons to what they're doing.\"",
      "HHS leaders may be unaware of their legal duty to issue the poverty guidelines, Ghertner said. If each state and federal government agency instead sets guidelines on its own, it could create inequities and lead to lawsuits, he said.",
      "And sticking with the 2025 standard next year could put benefits for hundreds of thousands of Americans at risk, Ghertner said. The current poverty level is $15,650 for a single person and $32,150 for a family of four.",
      "\"If you make $30,000 and have three kids, say, and next year you make $31,000 but prices have gone up 7%, suddenly your $31,000 doesn't buy you the same,\" he said, \"but if the guidelines haven't increased, you might be no longer eligible for Medicaid.\"",
      "The 2025 poverty level for a family of five is $37,650.",
      "As of October, about 79 million people were enrolled in Medicaid or the related Children's Health Insurance Program, both of which are means-tested and thus depend on the poverty guidelines to determine eligibility.",
      "Eligibility for premium subsidies for insurance plans sold in Affordable Care Act marketplaces is also tied to the official poverty level.",
      "One in eight Americans rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, and 40% of newborns and their mothers receive food through the Women, Infants, and Children program, both of which also use the federal poverty level to determine eligibility.",
      "Former employees in the office said they were not disloyal to the president. They knew their jobs required them to follow the administration's objectives. \"We were trying to support the MAHA agenda,\" the social scientist said, referring to Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" rubric. \"Even if it didn't align with our personal worldviews, we wanted to be useful.\"",

    "story": [
      "When Kathleen Whitman's daughter's Bernadoodle, Cody, swallowed a Kong toy, the family faced a veterinary emergency requiring immediate surgery.",
      "X-rays at their local suburban clinic suggested what looked like a hair tie tangled in Cody's intestines. When referred to a corporate emergency hospital, the family was quoted $10,000 for the procedure.",
      "\"They literally told me in the waiting room with a clipboard, thinking I was just coming in and we were doing $10,000,\" Whitman said. \"I said, 'No, I'm just coming in to hear the price.\"",
      "Desperate for an alternative, Whitman reached out to Vetique, a boutique veterinary clinic in Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood. There, Dr. Jessica Trice and Dr. Jennifer Remnes performed the surgery for what Whitman called \"an appropriate fee\" that was significantly less than $10,000.",
      "During the surgery, she and her daughter waited in the clinic's lobby with glasses of Prosecco while receiving regular updates.",
      "\"The humans were taken care of just as much as the puppy in distress was,\" Whitman said.",
      "This experience mirrors what many pet owners report when comparing corporate-owned emergency animal hospitals to independent practices. Kara Adams, whose 16-year-old rescue dog Shadow needed emergency eye surgery, also chose Vetique over corporate alternatives.",
      "When Adams called Vetique explaining she had only $1,000 available, staff accommodated her financial constraints.",

      "\"Just coming from a corporation for many years, the whole thing is about quantity, getting all those pets,\" Trice explained after spending 10 years at Banfield Pet Hospital, followed by five years as a medical director at VCA Animal Hospitals. \"We feel the best way is not pushing about the number of quantity, because it gets very sloppy and you lose that interaction and relationship with the clients.\"",

      "\"As a new grad, you're still learning and trying to break into this brand-new world. I was seeing like 30 pets a day,\" Remnes said.",
      "She later moved to VCA before its Mars acquisition, initially enjoying the autonomy because \"each hospital was able to operate as they liked to.\" After the corporate takeover, however, the pressure intensified.",
      "\"It was like, 'Oh, you need to see this number of pets, or we're decreasing your salary.' That's what's burning out the industry,\" Remnes said. \"You literally burn people out doing that. You can't possibly offer your best when you're crammed with all of these patients.\"",
      "These pressures contribute to a profession in crisis. A 2024 study in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association found that U.S. veterinarians are more likely to experience serious mental health struggles than most people.",
      "\"We have forums on Facebook where our industry has one of the highest suicide rates,\" Remnes noted. \"It's because of things like this, when you're given spreadsheets and quotas rather than focusing on patient care.\"",
      "Their solution was to create a different business model. Instead of maximizing patient volume, Vetique prioritizes extended appointment times and a calming environment with luxury touches like sparkling epoxy floors, examination tables with faux fur coverings and exam rooms named after the founders' pets.",
      "\"I'd rather see four pets a day. That meant that family was getting my full attention, that pet was getting everything that I do,\" Remnes explained.",
      "Alongside traditional veterinary medicine, Trice offers acupuncture, herbal remedies and chiropractic treatments \u2014 holistic approaches she had wanted to pursue at corporate practices but was discouraged from using.",
      "Surging pet care prices",
      "Setting prices at Vetique involves balancing fair market rates with the clinic's added value. What Remnes found surprising was how significantly corporate prices have increased in recent years. \"Prices are so drastically different from when I was at VCA seven years ago. They're charging actually close to what we're charging as a general practice for an exam,\" she noted.",
      "This observation led her to reconsider Vetique's own pricing strategy.",
      "\"It's like, 'Well, we can actually probably charge more, because we offer all these experiences along with it.' It's trying to find a happy medium, trying to be fair, but also knowing our value.\"",
      "Despite the appeal of the boutique model, both Remnes and Trice acknowledge significant business challenges. The clinic is in its third year of operation, still within the typical three-to-five-year window before seeing substantial returns. Unlike corporate-backed veterinary chains, Vetique is entirely funded through a bank loan.",
      "Vetique's founders see their clinic not as a competitor to corporate chains but as an alternative model for the industry. \"We're not competing,\" Trice said. \"We're creating a new veterinary culture.\"",
      "Corporate giants reshape vet landscape",
      "John Volk, senior consultant with Brakke Consulting, said veterinary practices historically grow 4-5% annually and carry minimal accounts receivable, making them attractive to investors.",
      "\"Pet care in general is very attractive to the financial community,\" Volk said. \"It's a very steady growth industry, and it's a cash business, so they carry very little accounts receivable because pet owners pay for their services at time of service.\"",
      "Mars Inc., best known for candy brands like M&M's and Snickers, has quietly become the largest owner of veterinary hospitals in the U.S. through a series of major acquisitions.",
      "The privately held company owns three of the nation's largest veterinary chains: Banfield Pet Hospital, VCA Animal Hospitals, and BluePearl Specialty and Emergency Pet Hospital \u2014 giving it control of more than 2,000 clinics across North America.",
      "Mars entered the pet care industry in 2007 by acquiring Banfield, which primarily operates inside PetSmart locations. In 2017, it significantly expanded its footprint by purchasing VCA for $9.1 billion \u2014 one of the largest acquisitions in veterinary history,\u00a0according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.",
      "VCA operates more than 900 hospitals in the U.S. and Canada, while Banfield has over 1,000 clinics nationwide. Unlike VCA, which grew by acquiring independent practices, Banfield has mostly launched new locations within retail stores.",
      "Mars's scale allows for standardized protocols, shared technology platforms and subscription-based wellness plans across its network. According to the company website, Mars Veterinary Health serves more than 25 million pets annually.",
      "While private equity firms have been acquiring veterinary practices since the late 1980s, the trend has accelerated significantly over the past 15 years. Volk estimates approximately 30% of veterinary practices are now corporate-owned.",
      "Despite the growth in corporate ownership, Volk sees no evidence that care quality differs significantly between corporate and independent practices.",
      "\"I've not seen any data to suggest that the services provided by corporately owned practices are materially different than services provided by independently owned practices,\" he said.",
      "However, some policymakers have raised concerns about the impact of consolidation on pricing. In January 2023, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, specifically called out Mars Veterinary Health and other large veterinary corporations in a letter to the Federal Trade Commission. Warren cited \"troubling reports of anti-competitive consolidation\" and suggested these corporate entities were using market power to \"raise prices for consumers and lower wages for veterinarians.\"",
      "Even as consolidation continues, Volk finds that independent practices remain viable. \"If you have a DVM degree and don't have a bad personal history, you can get money to buy or start a practice,\" he said. \"Veterinarians are one of the lowest-risk borrowers of any category.\"",
      "For new veterinarians, the industry offers growing opportunities. The American Veterinary Medical Association reports the average starting salary in companion animal medicine reached approximately $137,000 in 2024.",
      "Design, investment, and a human touch",
      "When clients walk into a Bond Vet clinic, they won't find the sterile environment or cluttered waiting rooms traditionally associated with veterinary offices. Instead, they'll encounter soft pastel colors, comfortable seating and an atmosphere deliberately designed to feel more like a high-end hospitality experience than a medical facility.",
      "\"The industry has two categories of clinics historically \u2014 many designed very clinical, cold and sterile, and then others called mom and pop, which could be cluttered or dirty,\" said Garrett Lewis, CEO of Bond Vet. \"The question is how to solve both problems.\"",
      "That solution \u2013 creating premium veterinary experiences with transparent pricing and greater accessibility \u2013 has attracted significant private equity investment.",
      "While these premium services might suggest significantly higher costs, Lewis emphasizes transparency in Bond Vet's pricing model. \"When someone comes in, you can look at the laptop and see exactly what the pricing is,\" he said. \"Our prices are just a little bit above average, but the experience is what differentiates us.\"",
      "This transparency extends to digital platforms, where clients can check prices online or via text before visiting. During appointments, veterinarians show pricing information directly to clients on laptops, allowing for discussion about options.",
      "Bond Vet, backed by a $170 million investment from Warburg Pincus, has expanded to 57 locations across the Northeast and Midwest since its founding in 2019. The company was inspired by human-focused healthcare models like One Medical, focusing on convenience, design, and a better experience for both pets and owners.",
      "\"They saw the same issue, which was that the industry wasn't serving clients and pets at a much higher level,\" Lewis said of Bond Vet's founders, who included a veterinarian and her husband. \"They quickly found it was very different to change culture and design in existing practices, so they rebooted from the ground up.\"",
      "Bond Vet's approach represents a broader trend in veterinary medicine, where traditional practices are being reinvented with a focus on client experience alongside medical care.",
      "Bond Vet's model bridges the gap between traditional veterinary practices and emergency hospitals, offering urgent care alongside preventative services \u2013 all with a hospitality-focused approach.",
      "\"In the 90s, if you needed sick care, your veterinarian would say, 'Come on in.' If you needed preventive care, they'd say, 'Come on in,'\" Lewis explained. \"What happened in the 2000s is a lot of specialization occurred where practices became just preventative and started referring out anything that looked urgent or sick.\"",
      "Bond Vet handles non-emergency urgent cases that might otherwise end up in expensive emergency rooms. \"ER practices see about 40% of their volume as urgent rather than emergent cases. Clients go to ER and spend twice as much, often having to wait longer,\" Lewis noted.",
      "These clinics feature design elements specifically created to reduce stress for pets \u2014 an approach that appears to be working. \"I always see dogs dragging their owners into the clinic, which is not a common thing,\" Lewis said.",
      "The \"no walls\" philosophy breaking ground",
      "Imagine walking into a veterinary emergency room and instead of being separated from your pet during a crisis, you're welcomed directly onto the treatment floor. At  VEG ER for Pets, this isn't just possible \u2014 it's mandatory.",
      "\"We built an entire business around it,\" said Dr. David Bessler, founder and CEO of VEG ER for Pets. \"It's much easier doing something 100% of the time than trying to do it 90% of the time.\"",
      "With 102 locations across 28 states, VEG ER for Pets represents an approach to emergency veterinary medicine that stands apart from both traditional practices and newer primary care models.",
      "Unlike other veterinary innovators that blend primary and urgent care, VEG ER for Pets focuses exclusively on emergency medicine \u2013 a deliberate strategy that Bessler calls \"a bit of a crazy bet.\"",
      "\"We took the hardest part of an industry, emergency, and created an entire business around that,\" said David Glattstein, co-founder and president of VEG ER for Pets. \"It's hard to make money, it's hard to get the team, it's hard to recruit, it's hard to train.\"",
      "VEG ER for Pets' most distinctive feature is its commitment to keeping pets with their owners throughout the entire treatment process, even during emergencies \u2014 an approach not found in traditional emergency hospitals, where pets are typically treated in back rooms away from owners.",
      "This transparency extends to the physical design of newer hospitals, which have eliminated traditional waiting rooms entirely. \"Our newer hospitals don't even have a lobby,\" Glattstein explained. \"You literally walk in and you're in the middle of the treatment floor.\"",
      "In a notable departure from many veterinary innovators, VEG ER for Pets has achieved financial independence from its initial investors and now funds its expansion through its own operations.",
      "\"VEG ER for Pets is now independently able to do that,\" Glattstein stated. \"We don't need anyone else to advocate for us or to pay for us. We're not beholden to anybody. We're beholden to our customers, and we're beholden to our veggies.\"",
      "This independence allows the company to maintain its distinctive approach while continuing to open 25-30 new locations annually.",
      "The company's exclusive focus on emergency care, while limiting in some ways, has allowed it to \"crack the code\" on veterinary emergencies according to Glattstein. \"We've kind of cracked the code on one way of doing things in emergency that results in a better experience for all of the souls that are there experiencing that at the same time.\"",

    "summary": "Inflation cooled in March, but economists expect prices to reaccelerate as some of President Trump's tariffs kick in.",
    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index in March rose 2.4% on an annual basis, showing progress in the Federal Reserve's battle to bring down inflation to a 2% rate.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was forecast to rise 2.6% last month, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in those prices over time.",
      "March's report comes after\u00a0inflation rose 2.8% on an annual basis in February.",
      "On a monthly basis, prices actually fell 0.1% in March, the first monthly drop in nearly five years.",
      "Inflation eased last month due partly to lower fuel prices, with gasoline tumbling 9.8% on an annual basis, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said.",
      "Another reason prices fell was sharp drops in travel-related costs, including airfares, which decreased 5.3% just from February to March. Hotel room prices dropped 3.5%.",
      "Economists said those declines in part reflected much slower international demand as the number of tourists visiting the United States has fallen sharply amid Trump's aggressive trade policy.",
      "Visits to the United States from overseas fell nearly 12% last month, according to government data.",
      "What experts say",
      "Easing inflation combined with President Trump's announcement yesterday of a 90-day pause in his reciprocal tariffs should help alleviate some concerns for the Federal Reserve when it meets on May 7 to make its next interest rate decision, said Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank.",
      "But because other tariffs orchestrated by Mr. Trump have recently gone into effect \u2014 such as auto tariffs \u2013 inflation nevertheless could pick up later this year, experts say.",
      "Yet March's data is \"backward looking\" and doesn't reflect the trade policy changes orchestrated by the Trump administration, noted Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions in Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs are still expected to lift inflation later in the year as the impact of the import duties trickle through the economy. Because tariffs are paid by U.S. importers like Walmart when they accept shipments of foreign goods, they typically pass off all or some of the tariff cost onto consumers through higher prices.",
      "The president's 90-day pause excludes China, a major exporter to the U.S., which will continue to face tariffs of 125% on its goods. And Mr. Trump's 10% universal duty will also likely to push up prices in the coming months, economists say. The higher import taxes will likely weigh on the economy's growth as well.",
      "What the CPI shows about egg prices",
      "Although consumer prices cooled in March, the CPI data showed egg prices continued to inch higher last month. According to the CPI figures, egg prices increased in March to reach a new record-high of $6.23 despite a drop in wholesale prices and no egg farms having bird flu outbreaks.",
      "More recently, grocers have told CBS News that egg prices are\u00a0showing signs of easing.",
      "Bird flu outbreaks were cited as the major cause of price spikes in January and February after more than 30 million egg-laying chickens were killed to prevent the spread of the disease.",
      "Since the current bird flu outbreak began, more than 168 million birds have been slaughtered, most of them egg-laying chickens. Any time a bird gets sick, the entire flock is killed to help keep bird flu from spreading. That can have an effect on the egg supply because massive egg farms may have millions of birds.",
      "What the CPI means for your money",
      "Despite today's cooler-than-expected CPI numbers, inflationary risks are still a threat to the U.S. economy, especially as some of Mr. Trump's tariffs are still in place while others are merely delayed, experts say.",
      "\"Going forward, the Fed is likely to face a difficult trade-off as tariff-driven price increases start to feed through to the inflation data and activity remains soft,\" Haigh said. \"We expect the Fed's initial reaction to be cautious, but the risks remain that a sharper than expected slowdown in the economy could result in a resumption of the Fed's easing cycle.\"",
      "Three of four economists polled by FactSet expect the Fed will hold rates steady at its next meeting on May 7. The current federal funds \u2014 the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 now stands in a range 4.5% to 4.75%.",
      "That means consumers and businesses are unlikely to see any relief on loan rates in the near term, although economists are penciling in cuts later in the year, with the majority forecasting a reduction at the Fed's June 18 meeting.",

      "CBS has lost distribution rights to \"Wheel of Fortune\" and \"Jeopardy!,\" with a Los Angeles court rejecting the network's bid for a preliminary injunction that would have blocked Sony from taking over.",
      "Sony, which produces the two iconic game shows, filed a complaint in October 2024 alleging that CBS entered into unauthorized licensing agreements. Specifically, the entertainment company claimed CBS licensed the shows at below-market rates and failed to maximize advertising revenue, among other alleged contract violations (CBS News and CBS are owned by Paramount Global.)",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 18:45:25 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump had brushed off the stock market's plunge, but turmoil in the bond market got his administration's attention.",
    "story": [
      "Even as stocks plunged in reaction to his administration's sweeping tariffs, President Trump expressed\u00a0confidence in his trade policies, saying last week that \"markets are going to boom.\" But by Wednesday, a collective thumb's down to the tariffs by bond investors had given Mr. Trump pause.",
      "With U.S. and global financial market tumbling, he abruptly suspended his administration's \"reciprocal tariffs\" on dozens of other countries for 90 days, acknowledging that the bond market was \"getting a little queasy.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's about-face was by no means the first time a sitting American president had blinked in the face of bond investors expressing alarm over U.S. policies they viewed as fiscally reckless and harmful to their portfolios. In their first terms, both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama also found themselves knocked back when the bond market rebelled at the cost of some of their strategic priorities.",
      "The \"bond vigilantes\" ride again",
      "Americans might think of bonds as a less risky asset class they turn to in their 401(k)s to offset more volatile investments, such as stock. But the $2.8 trillion Treasury market is also a bedrock of the U.S. government. The federal government finances the country's debt by selling Treasury bills to investors, who prize the asset because of the country's sterling credit rating and its guarantee of making good on interest payments.",
      "As the Trump administration's reciprocal tariffs went into effect on Wednesday, the bond prices slid and the yield on 2-year Treasury notes rose by as much as 0.3 percentage points, marking the biggest intraday move since 2009, according to financial data firm FactSet. (Bond prices move in inverse relation to their interest rates, or yields.)",
      "Such sudden moves can signal that investors are dumping their bonds. That pushes bond prices lower but boosts yields, which are the returns that bond holders pay to investors.",
      "\"Why is this happening? Fixed-income investors may be starting to worry that the Chinese and other foreigners might start selling their U.S. Treasuries,\" economist Ed Yardeni said in an April 8 research note.",
      "Yardeni, who coined the term \"bond vigilantes\" in the 1980s to describe fixed-income investors who express their disapproval of government policies by dumping Treasuries, added that the bond market was cautioning that \"the Trump administration may be playing with liquid nitro.\"",
      "In another report after Mr. Trump announced the tariff pause, Yardeni noted, \"The Bond Vigilantes have struck again. As far as we can tell, at least with respect to U.S. financial markets, they are the only 1.000 hitters in history.\"",
      "Some Trump administration officials acknowledged that the bond market's hostile reaction to the tariffs influenced the decision to pause the tariffs.",
      "\"[The] bond market was telling us, 'Hey, it is probably time to move,'\" White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett\u00a0said\u00a0on CNBC on Thursday.",
      "Soon after Mr. Trump announced his April 2 tariffs, economists raised concerns\u00a0about the potential impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "The president claimed the tariffs, which he called \"reciprocal\" because they were aimed at equalizing the trade barriers between the U.S. and its trading partners, would help revive manufacturing to the U.S. and raise revenue for the federal government.",
      "But experts warned that the tariffs, which ranged from a baseline 10% for most nations up to more than 100% for Chinese imports, raised the risks of a recession and would likely reignite inflation. Investors dumped stocks and bonds as they digested the economic risks of Mr. Trump's tariff barrage.",
      "While the stock market plunge hurt millions of Americans' retirement savings, the turmoil in the bond market creates very real pressures on the nation's finances. Because the Treasury Department pays interest to debt holders, any increase in yields puts more financial strain on the nation's coffers.",
      "\"Developments in the last 24 hours suggest we may be headed for serious financial crisis wholly induced by U.S. government tariff policy,\" Harvard University economist and former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers\u00a0said\u00a0in an April 9 thread on social media.",
      "He added, \"Long-term interest rates are gapping up, even as the stock market moves sharply downwards. This highly unusual pattern suggests a generalized aversion to U.S. assets in global financial markets.  We are being treated by global financial markets like a problematic emerging market.\"",
      "An expensive problem",
      "Given the size of the Treasury market, the surging bond yields and broader market turmoil could create an expensive problem for the federal government. For Mr. Trump, the timing was especially poor as he pushes Congress to pass an extension of his 2017 tax cuts, which are forecast to cost trillions over the next decade.",
      "In 2024, the U.S. spent more than $1 trillion to service its debt, more than double its roughly $500 billion in 2020, according to Treasury data. That's largely due to higher interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve to battle the post-pandemic surge in inflation.",
      "An increase in bond yields could add to that expense, putting even more pressure on the federal budget.",
      "\"Although President Donald Trump was able to resist the stock market selloff, once the bond market began to weaken, too, it was only a matter of time before he folded on his eye-wateringly high tariffs,\" noted economist Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics in an April 9 research note.",

The company, co-owned by Karen Sadaka and Teddy Sadaka, works with brands including Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren and Kenneth Cole, but most of its plants have shut down as garment jobs were shipped overseas.",

      "U.S. stocks soar in relief rally",
      "On Wall Street, the S&P 500 surged 9.5%, an amount that would count as a good year for the market. It had been sinking earlier in the day on worries that Mr. Trump's trade war could drag the global economy into a recession. But then came the posting on social media that investors worldwide had been waiting and wishing for.",

      "China was a huge exception, though, with Mr. Trump saying tariffs are going up to 125% against its products. That raises the possibility of more swings ahead that could stun financial markets. The trade war isn't over, and an escalating battle between the world's two largest economies can create plenty of damage. U.S. stocks are also still below where they were just a week ago, when Trump announced worldwide tariffs on what he called \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "But on Wednesday, at least, the focus on Wall Street was on the positive. The Dow shot to a gain of 2,962 points, or 7.9%. The Nasdaq composite leaped 12.2%. And the S&P 500 had its third-best day since 1940.",
      "The relief came after doubts had crept in about whether Mr. Trump cared about the financial pain the U.S. stock market was taking because of his tariffs. The S&P 500, the index that sits at the center of many 401(k) accounts, came into the day nearly 19% below the record its set less than two months ago.",
      "That surprised many professional investors who'd long thought a president who used to crow about records for the Dow under his watch would pull back on policies if they sent markets reeling.",
      "Wednesday's rally pulled the S&P 500 index away from the edge of what's called a \"bear market.\" That's what professionals call it when a run-of-the-mill drop of 10% for U.S. stocks, which happens every year or so, graduates into a more vicious fall of 20%. The index is now down 11.2% from its record.",
      "Bonds rebound",
      "Wall Street also got a boost from a relatively smooth auction of U.S. Treasurys on Wednesday. Earlier jumps in Treasury yields had indicated increasing levels of stress and Trump said he had been watching the bond market \"getting a little queasy.\"",
      "Higher yields on Treasurys put pressure on the stock market and push upward on rates for mortgages and other loans for U.S. households and businesses. U.S. Treasury yields have historically dropped - not risen - during volatile times because the bonds are usually seen as some of the safest possible investments.",
      "This week's sharp rise had brought the yield on the 10-year Treasury back to where it was in late February.",
      "After approaching 4.50% in the morning, the 10-year yield pulled back to 4.34% following Trump's pause and the Treasury's auction.",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 08:42:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump's aggressive use of tariffs has fueled concerns about the economy and roiled the stock market.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's barrage of \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on countries around the world this year has rattled consumers, businesses and investors. Although President Trump on Wednesday announced a 90-day pause on most of his new tariffs, he upped import duties on Chinese goods to 125% \u2014 escalating a conflict between the world's two largest economies.",
      "We asked you what questions you had about tariffs and answered some of those in a CBS News 24/7 special. Read on for some answers to your questions below.",
      "Are global tariffs legal, and have U.S. levies on other countries risen or fallen over the years?",
      "CBS MoneyWatch: Tariffs are legal under World Trade Organization rules, although participating countries must comply with certain restrictions and levies are generally capped.",
      "As a result, nations have long had the right to impose multilateral tariffs, although those costs vary widely based on trade agreements, product type and many other factors.",
      "In the 19th century, average U.S. tariff rates on trading partners routinely exceeded 30%. The government sharply reduced those levies after the Great Depression, cutting them to single digits. After resuming power in 2025, President Trump raised the effective U.S. tariff to 22% \u2014 the highest since 1909.",
      "For the Trump administration, are these massive tariffs intended to pressure other nations into more favorable trade deals, or is the goal to push American businesses to invest more in domestic manufacturing? Or both?",
      "Both, correct. These historically large tariffs have several main objectives. In the short term, the tariffs are intended to pressure countries to come to the table to negotiate what Mr. Trump sees as more favorable trade deals.",
      "Over the long term, Trump administration officials say that sharply raising U.S. tariffs will spur both domestic and foreign companies eager to avoid the added costs to expand here at home, creating jobs, reinvigorating manufacturers and boosting economic growth.",
      "President Trump has also long argued that global trade rules, enshrined in entities like the World Trade Organization, disdvantage the U.S. by, for example, permitting countries like China, Germany and Japan to subsidize key industries. He blames those rules for fueling large global trade imbalances that have saddled the U.S. with a large, and growing, trade deficit.",
      "Another goal of tariffs is to generate federal revenue \u2014 funds that Mr. Trump will likely need to offset additional tax cuts he has promised to Americans and to corporations.",
      "Why do some people oppose deploying tariffs against countries that impose tariffs on the U.S.?",
      "Most mainstream economists think the kind of sweeping tariffs imposed by Mr. Trump on nearly all U.S. imports act as a tax on businesses and consumers. Such levies raise the cost of many essential items, leading to higher prices for American households; depress economic growth; and could even trigger a recession.",
      "Under this view, a trade war in which countries jack up tariffs on their economic partners effectively makes them all poorer.",
      "By contrast, trade experts also say that targeted tariffs \u2014 implemented as but one element in a larger industrial strategy \u2014 can help protect critical U.S. industries and workers from unfair foreign competition.",
      "How do these tariffs impact consumers, especially when it comes to prices on everyday items like groceries or housewares?",
      "Tariffs are taxes paid by importers such as Walmart, which must pay the fees to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection when it accepts shipments at American ports. As a result, U.S. businesses typically pass on most or all of that cost to consumers through higher prices.",
      "For instance, after Mr. Trump added tariffs to imported washing machines during his first term, the median price of those appliances jumped more than 11%, tacking on about $86 to the cost of a new unit, according to University of Chicago researchers.",
      "While consumers can opt for U.S.-made merchandise, domestic manufacturers also may raise their prices due to tariffs. Sometimes that's due to an increase in the cost of imported goods they need to manufacture their products. But some companies also take the opportunity to hike prices because the newly expensive foreign-made products provide them with more pricing flexibility.",
      "Without Mr. Trump's pause, imported vegetables, fruit and nuts were set to rise by 19% due to the tariffs, according to a recent analysis from the Yale Budget Lab, a public policy think tank. That would have boosted prices for those foods by more than 6%, after adjusting for an expected 0.6% increase in the cost of the same items grown in the U.S.",
      "What's the long-term outlook \u2014 are these tariffs likely to strengthen the U.S. economy or just cause temporary disruption?",
      "Economists say Mr. Trump's tariffs have increased the risk that the U.S. and other nations could tumble into a recession in the next year. Because tariffs raise prices, Americans are expected to cut back on spending \u2014 a potentially major problem given that 70 cents of every $1 in the nation's gross domestic product is based on consumer spending.",
      "For instance, the tariffs could slow GDP growth to 1.4% in 2025, while core inflation could rise to 3.9% this year, according to an April 2 forecast from Oxford Economics. That would represent a significant slowdown from the economy's 2.8% growth rate in 2024.",
      "Other experts say leaving sharply higher U.S. tariffs in place could leave much deeper scars. GDP growth could fall by 0.6 percentage points over the next decade, the Yale Budget Lab estimated.",
      "What is the end goal for the Trump administration's tariffs?",
      "Mr. Trump has said he believes tariffs will bring back manufacturing jobs. By making it more expensive to sell foreign-made goods in the U.S., the president wants to convince American and foreign companies to build factories here.",
      "But he's also highlighted other goals for his tariff barrage, such as convincing other nations to give more favorable trading terms to the U.S.",
      "Lastly, Mr. Trump has pointed to tariffs as a way to raise billions in revenue for the U.S. government, even though economists point out that tariffs are essentially a sales tax which are paid by American consumers.",
      "Does Mr. Trump really think he's going to be able to rebuild manufacturing in America again?",
      "Mr. Trump is adamant that tariffs can revive manufacturing in the U.S., which has been on the decline for at least half a century. Yet economists and other experts aren't so sure.",
      "There are several reasons for their skepticism. For one, building the types of factories and infrastructure to support the manufacturing that is now handled by other nations, such as China and Vietnam, would require years and billions in investment.",
      "The U.S. manufacturing sector has been shrinking for decades, so companies repatriating factories from abroad would struggle to find enough skilled workers, especially in technology and other areas higher up the industrial value chain",
      "And because of the uncertainty caused by Mr. Trump's tariffs, some businesses might not want to commit to such an investment given that the import duties might disappear or be sharply lowered \u2014 as they were today.",
      "What could happen to block the U.S. tariff increases?",
      "Several factors could halt the tariffs imposed by Mr. Trump, according to experts.",
      "First, Congress could introduce a resolution to terminate the emergency declaration used by Mr. Trump to issue the tariffs. Since both the Senate and House are controlled by Republicans, that would require several members of the GOP to join Democrats in voting against Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "But Mr. Trump would likely veto any such measure that reached his desk, which means that two-thirds of both chambers would need to vote in favor of the measure in order to make it veto-proof.",
      "Second, the courts could intervene and rule that Mr. Trump has exceeded his authority. Already, there has been a lawsuit filed by a small business in Florida that argues that Mr. Trump has overstepped by issuing the April 2 tariffs, and that the power should belong to Congress alone.",
      "Third, the violent reaction in financial markets that followed Mr. Trump's latest tariff salvo could persuade him to change course. His move on Wednesday to pause many of the tariffs followed a five-day plunge in stocks that put the S&P 500 on the verge of entering a bear market \u2014 when equities fall at least 20% from their most recent high.",
      "That steep decline in stock prices hurts tens of millions of Americans saving for retirement and could lead them to cut their spending, a big drag on economic growth.",

      "Despite the pause, experts noted that uncertainty remains an issue for U.S. businesses, given that the tariffs could restart in 90 days and that the penalties on China \u2014 a major trading partner \u2014 are likely to dampen economic growth.",

      "President Trump has shaken up\u00a0stock markets\u00a0around the world as he announced\u00a0sweeping tariffs\u00a0on what he dubbed \"Liberation Day\"\u00a0last week, then partially reversed course shortly after. The Trump administration's imposition and walkback of tariffs has led to stock volatility and sparked worries of a global trade war and recession.",
      "In the United States, many are concerned about levies driving up the price of everyday goods, and Goldman Sachs economists on Monday cited them in a report\u00a0raising the odds of a recession to 45%. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned the tariffs could slow the economy and\u00a0\"will likely increase inflation.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's April 2 announcement set out a baseline 10% tax on all U.S. imports, plus additional \"reciprocal\" tariffs on imports from 90 countries. He pitched the tariffs as a strategy to reduce the trade deficit between the U.S. and other global powers, including China and the European Union.",
      "Exactly a week later, the president paused many of the newly announced reciprocal duties, with the exception of those placed on China.",
      "The reversal came a little over a month after Mr. Trump imposed 25% tariffs\u00a0on nearly all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, and\u00a0then announced a pause just two days later.",

      "As markets fluctuate, and with many of his most recent\u00a0reciprocal import duties\u00a0paused, here's what Mr. Trump has said about the tariffs.",
      "Trump reverses course, pauses tariffs",
      "Two days after Mr. Trump said during a\u00a0meeting with Israeli Prime Minister\u00a0Benjamin Netanyahu that he's not looking at any pauses in tariffs, he announced a 90-day pause on most of his planned tariffs and a lowering of the \"reciprocal tariff\" rate to 10% \u2014 with the exception of China.",
      "The U.S.\u00a0stock market surged\u00a0immediately after the president's announcement.",
      "When reporters asked about mixed messages from his administration on whether the tariffs are permanent or open to negotiation, the president said on April 7, \"they both can be true.\"",
      "\"We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and they're going to be fair deals,\" Mr. Trump said. \"No other president's going to do this, what I'm doing.\"",
      "On April 9, citing China's unwillingness to negotiate, Mr. Trump announced on Truth Social that he's raising taxes on China to 125%. China announced earlier in the day that it would\u00a0raise its tariffs on U.S. products to 84%.",
      "The president previously said there are \"other things besides tariffs\" that could be open to negotiation, like other countries' \"standards and tests\" that Mr. Trump said make trading more difficult, but he didn't provide further details.",
      "\"Hang tough\"",
      "In a Truth Social post on April 5 as his 10% universal tariffs took effect, Mr. Trump urged Americans to \"hang tough\" and acknowledged things \"won't be easy.\"",
      "\"China has been hit much harder than the USA, not even close. They, and many other nations, have treated us unsustainably badly,\" he wrote.",
      "\"We have been the dumb and helpless 'whipping post,' but not any longer. We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before. Already, more than FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT, and rising fast! THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL WIN. HANG TOUGH, it won't be easy, but the end result will be historic. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\"",
      "\"Sometimes you have to take medicine\"",
      "Mr. Trump doubled down on his trade position while speaking to reporters on April 6 on Air Force One, making clear he did not intend to budge on the reciprocal tariffs set to take effect later this week, nor the universal levies already implemented.",
      "Addressing the U.S. market plunge\u00a0that followed his April 2 announcement \u2014 Wall Street's worst in five years \u2014 and seemingly preparing Americans for more potential market pain to come, the president said, \"I don't want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\"",
      "\"What's going to happen with the market I can't tell you, but I can tell you our country has gotten a lot stronger,\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "He also said various world leaders had expressed interest in negotiating to roll back tariffs as global markets, reacting to the levies, began to nosedive, too.",
      "\"I spoke to a lot of leaders, European, Asian, from all over the world,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They're dying to make a deal. And I said, we're not going to have deficits with your country. We're not going to do that, because to me a deficit is a loss. We're going to have surpluses or at worst, going to be breaking even.\"",
      "Echoing Mr. Trump's sentiment, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick suggested the administration would not waver on the new round of tariffs, in an interview on\u00a0\"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"\u00a0Arguing the policies will help protect U.S. factories and \"reset the power of the United States of America,\" Lutnick acknowledged that \"it is going to be a big change.\"",
      "\"This is the moment that the United States of America takes hold of itself, and Donald Trump has been talking about this his whole life,\" Lutnick said. \"This is Donald Trump's agenda, and we're all here to help him execute.\"",
      "\"Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!)\"",
      "In the hour before trading opened on Wall Street on Monday, April 7, the president took to Truth Social to support his flurry of tariffs and appeared to coin a new Trump-ism referencing panic.",
      "\"The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO,\" Mr. Trump said in the post. \"Don't be Weak! Don't be Stupid! Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!). Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!\"",
      "He posted as international markets were experienced significant losses, with indices in Australia, Germany, Hong Kong, Shanghai, South Korea, Taiwan and Tokyo all dropping. U.S. markets went on to have a roller-coaster day, with the S&P 500 ending down a modest 12 points, or 0.2%, at 5,062, the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 349 points, or 0.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite eked out a small gain, rising 15 points to close up 0.1%.",
      "Additional tariffs on China",
      "Mr. Trump vowed on Monday, April 7, to raise duties imposed on China to 50% after Beijing issued retaliatory tariffs of 34% on the U.S. over the weekend.",
      "On Truth Social, the president said Beijing had acted despite his previous \"warning\" that the U.S. would only respond to retaliatory tariffs with even higher taxes for the issuing country, and urged its leaders to withdraw the 34% increase or face higher costs.",
      "\"Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!\" Mr. Trump said. \"Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"",
      "China did not withdraw its tariffs and the ratcheting up continued, with Mr. Trump increasing U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to 104% and then and then 125% as China upped\u00a0its tariffs on U.S. goods to 84%.",

      "A global trade war is brewing as the U.S. imposes tariffs on a growing list of countries, heightening concerns about economic growth and roiling stock markets around the world.",
      "President Trump on April 2 announced so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from about 90 nations that are above a 10% across-the-board tax applied to all imports to the U.S. Describing the announcement as \"Liberation Day,\" the president said the new taxes are needed to erase a trade deficit between the U.S. and other countries, ranging from China to the European Union.",
      "Some nations are facing only the universal tariff of 10%, while imports from dozens of other countries are charged a higher specific reciprocal import levy. For instance, Australian imports face the baseline rate of 10%, while China-made products are now paying an import duty that has jumped to 104%\u00a0\u2014 the reciprocal tariffs combined with previously announced duties of 20% \u2014 after slapping its own tariffs on U.S. imports.",
      "\"Reciprocal. That means they do it to us, and we do it to them,\" Mr. Trump said in his April 2 remarks.",
      "However, on April 9 Mr. Trump backed away from parts of his plan, announcing a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs and lowering the tariff rate to 10% for almost all nations. The notable exception was China, with Mr. Trump saying that he's instead raising the tariff rate on the country's imports to 125%.",
      "\"Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World's Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Stocks soared after Mr. Trump's April 9 announcement, with the S&P 500 gaining 8.4% in afternoon trading and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surging 7%. Still, some on Wall Street cautioned that the pause is still on track to end in 90 days, which could signal more volatility ahead.",
      "\"The tariff clouds parted for the first time today, but it's too soon to know how sunny the skies will be tomorrow \u2014 or 90 days from now,\" said Daniel Skelly, head of Morgan Stanley's Wealth Management Market Research & Strategy Team, in an email.",
      "Worst-hit countries",
      "Before he announced the pause, Asian nations were set to face the worst of the brunt, with Cambodia facing a tax rate at 49% and Vietnam at 46%, according to Nationwide Chief Economist Kathy Bostjancic.",
      "Mr. Trump also said such levies will boost domestic manufacturing and level the playing field with other countries that impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports than the U.S. charges for their products. Still, economists are forecasting that the tariffs will cause inflation to reignite, while also prompting some trade partners to retaliate with higher tariffs on American imports to their nations.",
      "If the tariffs are maintained by the Trump administration and if other nations impose retaliatory tariffs, both the U.S. and other countries \"will suffer serious recessions,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "China retaliated by saying it planned to impose a retaliatory\u00a034% import fee\u00a0on American products, followed by Mr. Trump retaliating with plans to impose an additional 50% tariff on its imports and China ratcheting up its rate to 84%.",
      "Full list of Trump's reciprocal tariffs by country",
      "When do these tariffs go into effect?",
      "The reciprocal rates were originally set to go into effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 9, but later that day President Trump announced a\u00a0postponement for 90 days. That's in addition to a baseline 10% tariff which took effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 5.",
      "How did the Trump administration decide what tariffs to charge which countries?",
      "Mr. Trump said his administration determined the tariff rate for each country based on the monetary levies those nations charge on U.S. imports, as well as non-monetary trade barriers like regulations that make it tougher for American products to enter those markets.",
      "The president added that the reciprocal tariffs are still only half the rates charged by those nations on U.S. products, characterizing his new levies as \"kind.\"",
      "Are other countries retaliating against U.S. tariffs?",
      "Yes. China said it would impose a\u00a034% tariff on imports\u00a0of all U.S. products starting April 10, and then raised the level to 84%. The Chinese Commerce Ministry also said it would implement tighter restrictions on exports of rare earths \u2014materials used in products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries \u2014 as well impose 27 additional U.S. companies to trade sanctions.",

      "Apple iPhones could become even pricier under President Trump's reciprocal tariffs on roughly 90 foreign nations, which were slated to take effect Wednesday, but are now on hold for 90 days, with the exception of levies on China.",
      "In a move that threatens to raise costs on all electronics, including iPhones, the White House on Tuesday said it would follow through on a threat to enact a 104% tariff on all Chinese goods imported into the U.S. The levy took effect Wednesday at 12:01 a.m. EDT. Later Wednesday, Mr. Trump raised the tariff rate to 125%, effective immediately.",
      "The price for the popular tech tool, which starts at $599 for the most basic model, the iPhone 16e, is poised to increase by hundreds of dollars, depending on how Apple responds to the sweeping levies. The iPhone 16 Pro 128 GB, which features Apple Intelligence, costs $999.",
      "The iPhone accounts for about half of Apple's revenue. Most of its smartphones are manufactured in China.",
      "Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives said in a research note Tuesday that the added levies could create a \"category 5 price storm\" for personal electronics and other gadgets. Taxing China and other nations at such rates is the equivalent of \"flipping a boat upside down in the ocean with no life rafts,\" he added.",
      "How much more could an iPhone cost?",
      "The iPhone 16 Pro Max 256 GB, which is among the devices that are assembled in China, retails for $1,199. Under the new tariffs on Chinese imports, the price of the device could rise by $675, or 56%, lifting the price tag to $1,874, an April 9 analysts from UBS Investment Research shows.",

      "Apple didn't respond to a request for comment on how the Trump tariffs could affect iPhone prices.",
      "What if Apple moved production to the U.S.?",
      "President Trump has said the new U.S. tariffs are aimed at spurring both domestic and foreign companies to build in the U.S. But for Apple and other companies, manufacturing their products in the U.S. entail significantly higher labor costs \u2014 costs that would largely be passed on to consumers.",
      "If Apple were to begin assembling iPhones in the U.S, a Chinese-made device that previously sold for $1,000 would cost $3,500 if manufactured in New Jersey, Texas or some other state, Ives estimated.",
      "\"Saying we can just make this in the USA is a statement that incredibly understates the complexity of the Asia supply chain and the way electronics, chips, semi fabs, hardware, smartphones, etc. are made for U.S. consumers over the last 30 years,\" he said in a report.",
      "As a result, Ives is highly skeptical that tariffs alone will lead companies to shift their manufacturing plants from low-cost havens like China to the U.S., calling the idea \"absurd.\"",
      "But some companies, including Apple, could attempt to rejigger supply chains to avoid the steepest tariffs. For example, Apple plans to manufacture more iPhones in India to reduce its reliance on China, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported, citing people familiar with the matter.",

Kozak, a senior State Department official, said in the filing submitted minutes after a 5 p.m. deadline set by the judge. \"He is alive and secure in that facility.

They will never threaten or menace our Citizens again!\"",
      "The state department's filing comes one day after a U.S. government attorney struggled in a hearing to provide U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis with any information about Garcia's whereabouts.

    "summary": "The Trump administration could release files on the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy \u2014 the U.S. health secretary's father \u2014 within days, after decades of public fascination about the killing.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration plans to release new documents on former Sen. Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 assassination in the coming days, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said Thursday, bringing fresh attention to a killing that has drawn public fascination for decades.",
      "It's not clear what \u2014 if any \u2014 new information will emerge from the release. But the disclosures have drawn the backing of President Trump and his health and human services secretary, the slain politician's son Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "During the cabinet meeting in which Gabbard announced the planned release, the health secretary \u2014 who has claimed for years his father's convicted assassin, Sirhan Sirhan, may be innocent \u2014 said he's \"very grateful\" for the release, while Mr. Trump said, \"it's time.\"",
      "Why is the Trump administration releasing files on RFK?",
      "Days after taking office, Mr. Trump signed an executive order directing his government to release files on the 1960s assassinations of three high-profile figures: President John F. Kennedy, his brother Robert F. Kennedy and Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.",
      "The administration released a set of newly unredacted files on John F. Kennedy's 1963 killing last month. Gabbard said in a Cabinet meeting Thursday there are \"over a hundred people working around the clock to scan the paper\" around Robert F. Kennedy and King's 1968 assassinations, and her team will \"have those ready to release here within the next few days.\"",
      "What do we expect in the newly released RFK files?",
      "It's unclear what documents on Robert F. Kennedy's assassination are held by the federal government or slated for release. It also remains to be seen whether the disclosures will contain new information, though, on Thursday, Gabbard referenced files that have been \"sitting in boxes in storage for decades\" and \"have never been scanned or seen before.\"",
      "Many files on Robert F. Kennedy's assassination \u2014 which was handled by local police investigators in California, where he was killed \u2014 are already public. The state of California has held tens of thousands of pages of documents on the killing since the late 1980s, including troves of records from the Los Angeles Police Department's initial investigation into Sirhan. The bulk of those documents are publicly available, the state says, writing, \"every effort has been made to provide the fullest possible disclosure of the records.\"",
      "The University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, also maintains an archive with public records on the assassination.",
      "Tim Tate, a writer who argues Sirhan did not fire the bullets that killed Robert F. Kennedy, told CBS News he's \"cautious\" about the Trump administration's promise to release new documents. He noted the files held by the California state archive \u2014 including records from a separate FBI probe on the assassination \u2014 are supposed to be comprehensive. While it would be \"disturbing\" if any files from the FBI or other agencies were omitted, it's unclear what, if anything, was withheld, he said.",
      "Tate said it's possible \"it could all turn out to be a great big nothing burger.\"",
      "Similarly, writer Dan Moldea \u2014 who says Sirhan was solely responsible for the assassination \u2014 said he \"can't imagine something coming out on the RFK files that is going to be striking.\"",
      "\"I can't imagine anything of any importance coming out of this,\" Moldea said. \"Anything important would have been in the LAPD files.\"",
      "But Lisa Pease, a writer who has argued Sirhan did not kill Robert F. Kennedy, told CBS News she believes the federal government may hold documents that could shed new light on the assassination. She pointed to records suggesting the CIA communicated with the Los Angeles Police Department about Sirhan during its probe into the killing.",
      "\"We've only ever seen the LAPD's side of that conversation, so this is our first chance to maybe, hopefully, find the CIA's records pertaining to those conversations,\" Pease said. \"I think there might be some very interesting files.\"",
      "Who assassinated RFK \u2014 and why is RFK Jr. interested in it?",
      "Robert F. Kennedy, then a New York senator and leading Democratic presidential primary candidate, was fatally shot at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 5, 1968. Five others were injured. Sirhan was convicted of first-degree murder in the killing in 1969 and has spent over a half-century in California state prison, losing over a dozen requests for parole.",
      "Sirhan\u2014 whose family is Palestinian \u2014 has admitted to killing Kennedy and suggested he was motivated by the presidential candidate's support for Israel, though he has also asserted his innocence at various points or claimed he couldn't remember key details from the slaying.",
      "For decades, some critics of the investigation have questioned whether Sirhan was the true assassin or claimed he wasn't the only gunman. They often cite conflicts between an autopsy report and eyewitness testimony or muddled evidence about the number of gunshots. Still, plenty of other researchers have supported the conclusion that Sirhan acted alone.",
      "One skeptic is Kennedy's son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who met with Sirhan in prison in 2018 and later told the Washington Post he was \"disturbed that the wrong person might have been convicted of killing my father.\" He and his brother Douglas Kennedy backed Sirhan's 2021 bid for parole, and\u00a0California's parole board later recommended Sirhan's release, though Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom later rejected the request.",
      "Several of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s siblings disagree with the health secretary, vehemently pushing back against Sirhan's bids for parole. Chris Kennedy told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" in 2021 that he doesn't believe Sirhan's claims of innocence: \"I know he's a murderer, so it's not a big leap to believe he's a liar,\" he said.",

And then if there is a prior medical history of risk factor or some other issue, maybe an EKG, a chest X-ray, ultrasound, echocardiogram, that sort of thing.\"",
      "But Gounder noted there's another element to it as well.",
      "\"A presidential physical is not your typical physical exam,\" she said. \"I think it makes more sense to think about this as a curated medical PR event, really intended to reassure the public that the president is able to perform his duties.\"",
      "In November 2023, Mr.\u00a0Trump posted a letter\u00a0from his doctor of osteopathic medicine, Bruce Aronwald, summarizing his September checkup.

      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis said in a written order that the administration \"made no meaningful effort to comply\" with her directive to file a declaration addressing three questions related to the confinement of\u00a0Kilmar Abrego Garcia\u00a0at a Salvadoran supermax prison: his current physical location and custodial status; what stems the administration has taken to facilitate his return to the U.S.; and what steps they will take and when to facilitate his release.",
      "\"From this court's perspective, defendants' contention that they could not answer these basic questions absent some nonspecific 'vetting' that has yet to take place, provides no basis for their lack of compliance,\" she wrote.",
      "Xinis directed the administration to file daily declarations providing information in response to her queries. Her written order came after a hearing Friday.\u00a0 The Justice Department had told her in a filing earlier in the day that it was unable to provide the information she requested about Abrego Garcia and called a Friday morning deadline she set to provide the details \"impracticable.\"",
      "Xinis had\u00a0ordered the Trump administration to give her information about Abrego Garcia after the Supreme Court on Thursday reaffirmed her directive for the federal government to \"facilitate\" his release from Salvadoran custody.",
      "During the hearing Friday afternoon, Xinis asked Drew Ensign, a Justice Department lawyer, why he could not provide answers to her questions, including on Abrego Garcia's whereabouts.",
      "\"I'm not asking for state secrets,\" she said. \"I'm asking a very simple question: where is he?\"",
      "Ensign repeatedly said he was not given information that he could provide to the court, including Abrego Garica's custodial status and who had authority over him. Trump administration officials are still evaluating the Supreme Court's order, he said.",
      "Xinis repeatedly pressed Ensign about where Abrego Garcia is. He noted that his lawyers said Abrego Garcia's last known location is in El Salvador and acknowledged the government has not put forth information to the contrary.",
      "The judge called the lack of evidence from the Justice Department about Abrego Garcia's whereabouts \"extremely troubling.\"",
      "\"It behooves this case and how the system of justice works that the following be communicated to your clients: You are the officer of the court. You are the instrument to represent\" the government, Xinis said. She said that the record in the case currently shows that despite her directive to take steps to bring Agrego Garcia back to the U.S., \"your clients have done nothing to facilitate\" his return.",
      "\"I'm not sure what to take from the fact that the Supreme Court has spoken quite clearly and yet I can't get an answer today about what you've done, if anything, in the past,\" Xinis said.",
      "Ensign told the judge that the federal government \"intends to comply with the Supreme Court's order.\" He said that while the administration is prepared to answer her questions about Abrego Garcia's whereabouts and what actions have been taken to secure his return, they may assert privileges.",
      "Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Abrego Garcia's lawyer, said his lawyers and family have not had contact with Abrego Garcia, and accused the Trump administration of \"playing games with their own lawyers.\"",
      "\"They clearly didn't comply\" with the district court's order to turn over information about Abrego Garcia, he said.",
      "In the\u00a0filing to the court ahead of the hearing, Justice Department attorneys told the judge they \"are not in a position where they 'can' share any information requested by the court. That is the reality.\"",
      "\"Defendants received the order late in the evening last night. They are reviewing the order and actively evaluating next steps,\" they wrote. \"It is unreasonable and impracticable for defendants to reveal potential steps before those steps are reviewed, agreed upon, and vetted. Foreign affairs cannot operate on judicial timelines, in part because it involves sensitive country-specific considerations wholly inappropriate for judicial review.\"",
      "The Justice Department lawyers said that the judge gave them an \"insufficient amount of time\" to review the Supreme Court's order and argued she has not yet provided clarity as to the scope of her initial directive, as the high court told her to do.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys opposed the government's request for more time to respond to the judge's directives and accused the Justice Department of continuing \"to delay, obfuscate, and flout court orders, while a man's life and safety is at risk.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia, who lives in Maryland with his wife and children, was arrested and removed to El Salvador last month after Trump administration officials accused him of having ties to the MS-13 gang.\u00a0 His lawyers said he has no affiliation with MS-13, and has never been charged or convicted of any criminal offenses in the U.S. or El Salvador.",
      "The 29-year-old is being confined at the notorious Salvadoran prison known as CECOT, along with other migrants sent there by the administration as part of an agreement with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele. Under the deal, the U.S. government is paying the Salvadoran government $6 million to hold U.S. detainees.",
      "But Abrego Garica's case emerged as a flashpoint in President Trump's immigration crackdown after a U.S. immigration official acknowledged in a court filing that his removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error\" and \"oversight.\"",
      "In 2019, an immigration judge granted Abrego Garcia relief known as withholding of removal, which forbids the government from returning him to his home country of El Salvador because he is more likely than not to face persecution from local gangs, according to court records.",
      "While the Trump administration admitted the error in sending Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, it has argued that the district court has no jurisdiction over the Salvadoran government and therefore cannot force it to release Abrego Garcia from its prison. Justice Department lawyers have said that the Salvadoran government has custody of Abrego Garcia, so he cannot be returned to the U.S. unless it releases him.",
      "Abrego Garcia and his wife filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Maryland following his arrest and removal, alleging it violated federal immigration law. They sought an order requiring his return to U.S. custody.",
      "Xinis granted that request last week following a hearing and directed the government to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. no later than 11:59 p.m. Monday. The dispute ended up before the Supreme Court, and Chief Justice John Roberts put that deadline on hold to allow the high court more time to consider the matter.",
      "Then, on Thursday, the Supreme Court unanimously agreed that the Trump administration had to \"facilitate\" the release of Abrego Garcia from Salvadoran custody and \"ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador\" \u2014 to provide Abrego Garcia with due process of law.",
      "But the Supreme Court also directed the district court to clarify its order, and specifically the directive that the government \"effectuate\" Abrego Garcia's return.",
      "\"The district court should clarify its directive, with due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs,\" the court said. \"For its part, the government should be prepared to share what it can concerning the steps it has taken and the prospect of further steps.\"",

      "Jena, Louisiana \u2014 An immigration judge in Louisiana on Friday allowed the Trump administration to move forward with its effort to deport Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil, upholding one of the deportation grounds cited by the government.",
      "Assistant Chief Immigration Judge Jamee Comans ruled that the administration's determination that Khalil poses \"adverse foreign policy consequences\" for the U.S. is \"facially reasonable\" and makes Khalil deportable.",
      "The judge gave Khalil's lawyers until April 23 to file applications for relief to stop his deportation to Syria or Algeria on this ground. Khalil was born in Syria but is a citizen of Algeria, according to court documents.",
      "Comans held in abeyance the second deportation ground cited by the Trump administration: a claim that Khalil committed immigration fraud because he allegedly omitted information about his work history in his green card application.",
      "Comans made the determinations Friday afternoon, inside the courtroom of the privately operated U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Jena where Khalil has been held for weeks.",
      "Khalil, a vocal member of the protests at Columbia University over the war in Gaza, was arrested in early March by ICE, outside of his New York City apartment, where he lived with his pregnant U.S. citizen wife.",
      "After Comans issued her ruling, Khalil, attired in a blue uniform and sandals, asked to be allowed to give remarks.",
      "Khalil noted that the judge had previously talked about \"due process and fundamental fairness,\" and the former Columbia student said those principles were not followed in his case.",
      "Khalil said the Trump administration shipped him \"1,000 miles away\" from his family. He concluded by telling the judge that the cases of other migrants detained here at the ICE facility in Jena, Louisiana should also be addressed with urgency.",
      "After the hearing, Marc van der Hout, an attorney for Khalil, said in a statement, \"Today, we saw our worst fears play out: Mahmoud was subject to a charade of due process, a flagrant violation of his right to a fair hearing, and a weaponization of immigration law to suppress dissent. This is not over, and our fight continues.\"",
      "\"If Mahmoud can be targeted in this way, simply for speaking out for Palestinians and exercising his constitutionally protected right to free speech, this can happen to anyone over any issue the Trump administration dislikes,\" van der Hout added.",
      "The government hasn't charged Khalil with any crime, but it has argued in immigration court that he should be stripped of his green card and deported on two civil immigration grounds.",
      "The Trump administration has invoked a rarely used provision of immigration law that allows the government to seek the deportation of noncitizens whose \"presence or activities\" are determined to \"have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\"",
      "Faced with a deadline this week to provide evidence against Khalil, the Department of Homeland Security filed a memorandum by Secretary of State Marco Rubio outlining the foreign policy rationale.",
      "Rubio cited no specific evidence against Khalil, a 30-year-old legal permanent resident whose American citizen wife is in the late stages of pregnancy. But he said Khalil's presence in the country undermines \"U.S. policy to combat anti-Semitism around the world and in the United States, in addition to efforts to protect Jewish students from harassment and violence in the United States.\"",
      "The Trump government has separately alleged that Khalil committed immigration fraud by failing to disclose certain information in his green card application, including his work for the British Embassy in Beirut and the United Nations agency for Palestinian migrants and refugees.",
      "Khalil's attorneys harshly criticized Rubio's memo and the government's case against Khalil. They claim the government is violating Khalil's right to free speech.",
      "\"If the secretary of state claims the power to arrest, detain and deport someone, including a lawful permanent resident, simply because that person dissents from U.S. foreign policy, there are no limits. There's no beginning and no end to that kind of executive power,\" said Johnny Sinodis, an attorney for Khalil's immigration case, on Thursday.",
      "Khalil has separately sued the government over his arrest, detention and the effort to deport him. That case, in federal court in New Jersey, seeks an order that would require Khalil's release and the rescinding of the Rubio determination. It also asks a judge to prohibit the Trump administration from targeting noncitizens \"who engage in constitutionally protected expressive activity in the United States in support of Palestinian rights or critical of Israel.\"",

      "The motion filed Friday in the U.S. District Court of the Southern District said U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi ordered the death penalty to \"carry out President Trump's agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again.\"",
      "Mangione, 26, who faces state murder and terrorism charges in New York, along with\u00a0federal murder and stalking charges, is accused of murdering\u00a0United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson\u00a0last year in New York City.",
      "Mangione has\u00a0pleaded not guilty to 11 state charges\u00a0and is not eligible for the death penalty in New York State. He has not yet been arraigned on the federal charges.",
      "Karen Agnifilo and Avi Moskowitz, Mangione's attorneys, wrote in the motion that their client seeks relief because the attorney general prejudiced the grand jury pool and has corrupted the grand jury process by publicly issuing the death penalty direction to prosecutors via a press release.",
      "\"Luigi Mangione's murder of Brian Thompson \u2014 an innocent man and father of two young children \u2014 was a premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America. After careful consideration, I have directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in this case as we carry out President Trump's agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again,\" Bondi said in a statement earlier in April.",
      "His attorneys also argued that Bondi's Instagram post\u00a0following the press release in which she stated that Mangione was guilty of murder further prejudiced the grand jury process in the Southern District. They also referenced a television appearance where the Attorney General reiterated that Mangione hunted down and executed Thompson. His attorneys wrote that Bondi's \"pattern of public statements show with remarkable clarity and consistency that she has ordered this capital prosecution unabashedly for political reasons.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 11 Apr 2025 12:27:10 -0400",
    "summary": "Recent cuts eliminated a small, specialized workforce that sets the poverty standards determining who is eligible for Medicaid as well as assistance with food, home heating, child care, and more.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's firings at the Department of Health and Human Services included the entire office that sets federal poverty guidelines, which determine whether tens of millions of Americans are eligible for health programs such as Medicaid, food assistance, child care, and other services, former staff said.",
      "The small team, with technical data expertise, worked out of HHS' Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, or ASPE. Their dismissal mirrored others across HHS, which came without warning and left officials puzzled as to why they were \"RIF'ed\" \u2014 as in \"reduction in force,\" the bureaucratic language used to describe the firings.",
      "\"I suspect they RIF'ed offices that had the word 'data' or 'statistics' in them,\" said one of the laid-off employees, a social scientist whom KFF Health News agreed not to name because the person feared further recrimination. \"It was random, as far as we can tell.\"",
      "Among those fired was Kendall Swenson, who had led development of the poverty guidelines for many years and was considered the repository of knowledge on the issue, according to the social scientist and two academics who have worked with the HHS team.",
      "The sacking of the office could lead to cuts in assistance to low-income families next year unless the Trump administration restores the positions or moves its duties elsewhere, said Robin Ghertner, the fired director of the Division of Data and Technical Analysis, which had overseen the guidelines.",
      "The poverty guidelines are \"needed by many people and programs,\" said Timothy Smeeding, a professor emeritus of economics at the La Follette School of Public Affairs at the University of Wisconsin. \"If you're thinking of someone you fired who should be rehired, Swenson would be a no-brainer,\" he added.",
      "Under a 1981 appropriations bill, HHS is required annually to take Census Bureau poverty-line figures, adjust them for inflation, and create guidelines that agencies and states use to determine who is eligible for various types of help.",
      "There's a special sauce for creating the guidelines that includes adjustments and calculations, Ghertner said. Swenson and three other staff members would independently prepare the numbers and quality-check them together before they were issued each January.",
      "Everyone in Ghertner's office was told last week, without warning, that they were being put on administrative leave until June 1, when their employment would officially end, he said.",
      "\"There's literally no one in the government who knows how to calculate the guidelines,\" he said. \"And because we're all locked out of our computers, we can't teach anyone how to calculate them.\"",
      "ASPE had about 140 staff members and now has about 40, according to a former staffer. The HHS shake-up merged the office with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ, whose staff has shrunk from 275 to about 80, according to a former AHRQ official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "HHS has said it laid off about 10,000 employees and that, combined with other moves, including a program to encourage early retirements, its workforce has been reduced by about 20,000. But the agency has not detailed where it made the cuts or identified specific employees it fired.",
      "\"These workers were told they couldn't come into their offices so there's no transfer of knowledge,\" said Wendell Primus, who worked at ASPE during the Bill Clinton administration. \"They had no time to train anyone, transfer data, etc.\"",
      "HHS defended the firings. The department merged AHRQ and ASPE \"as part of Secretary Kennedy's vision to streamline HHS to better serve Americans,\"\u00a0 spokesperson Emily Hilliard said. \"Critical programs within ASPE will continue in this new office\" and \"HHS will continue to comply with statutory requirements,\" she said in a written response to KFF Health News.",
      "After this article published, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon called KFF Health News to say others at HHS could do the work of the RIF'ed data analysis team, which had nine members. \"The idea that this will come to a halt is totally incorrect,\" he said. \"Eighty million people will not be affected.\"",
      "Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has so far declined to testify about the staff reductions before congressional committees that oversee much of his agency. On April 9, a delegation of 10 Democratic members of Congress waited fruitlessly for a meeting in the agency's lobby.",
      "The group was led by House Energy and Commerce health subcommittee ranking member Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), who told reporters afterward that Kennedy must appear before the committee \"and tell us what his plan is for keeping America healthy and for stopping these devastating cuts.\"",
      "Matt VanHyfte, a spokesperson for the Republican committee leadership, said HHS officials would meet with bipartisan committee staff on April 11 to discuss the firings and other policy issues.",
      "ASPE serves as a think tank for the HHS secretary, said Primus, who later was Rep. Nancy Pelosi's senior health policy adviser for 18 years. In addition to the poverty guidelines, the office maps out how much Medicaid money goes to each state and reviews all regulations developed by HHS agencies.",
      "\"These HHS staffing cuts \u2014 20,000 \u2014 obviously they are completely nuts,\" Primus said. \"These were not decisions made by Kennedy or staff at HHS. They are being made at the White House. There's no rhyme or reasons to what they're doing.\"",
      "HHS leaders may be unaware of their legal duty to issue the poverty guidelines, Ghertner said. If each state and federal government agency instead sets guidelines on its own, it could create inequities and lead to lawsuits, he said.",
      "And sticking with the 2025 standard next year could put benefits for hundreds of thousands of Americans at risk, Ghertner said. The current poverty level is $15,650 for a single person and $32,150 for a family of four.",
      "\"If you make $30,000 and have three kids, say, and next year you make $31,000 but prices have gone up 7%, suddenly your $31,000 doesn't buy you the same,\" he said, \"but if the guidelines haven't increased, you might be no longer eligible for Medicaid.\"",
      "The 2025 poverty level for a family of five is $37,650.",
      "As of October, about 79 million people were enrolled in Medicaid or the related Children's Health Insurance Program, both of which are means-tested and thus depend on the poverty guidelines to determine eligibility.",
      "Eligibility for premium subsidies for insurance plans sold in Affordable Care Act marketplaces is also tied to the official poverty level.",
      "One in eight Americans rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, and 40% of newborns and their mothers receive food through the Women, Infants, and Children program, both of which also use the federal poverty level to determine eligibility.",
      "Former employees in the office said they were not disloyal to the president. They knew their jobs required them to follow the administration's objectives. \"We were trying to support the MAHA agenda,\" the social scientist said, referring to Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" rubric. \"Even if it didn't align with our personal worldviews, we wanted to be useful.\"",

      "A Senate committee heard from several experts Thursday on setting a year-round time standard instead of switching back and forth with daylight saving time. President Trump recently called it a \"50/50 issue,\" but he previously vowed to get rid of daylight saving.",
      "At the hearing, the committee's chairman, Sen. Ted Cruz, said there is a general consensus among his colleagues that the system of switching the clocks needs to be changed, but he said there is disagreement about whether to adopt universal standard time or daylight saving time.",
      "\"I personally struggle with the two choices here, because it's a question of what do you care about more: sunshine and joy and fun and money, or health, mental health, physical health,\" said Cruz, a Republican from Texas. \"And the honest answer for most people, gosh, I care about all that stuff.\"",
      "Cruz said an alternative has been discussed to pick daylight saving time, but letting states opt out. Arizona and Hawaii current opt out of changing the clock. But others said in Thursday's hearing that having different standards for different states could cause widespread confusion.",
      "The Senate Commerce Committee hearing notice did not set a preference for daylight saving time or standard time, but instead said it would focus on \"various issues around whether the country should continue 'springing forward' and 'falling back' each year with time.\"",
      "Daylight saving time begins in March, when clocks are moved forward an hour, and ends in October, when the clocks go back to standard time.",
      "The twice-yearly time changes are\u00a0generally unpopular\u00a0among Americans, with 63% saying they\u00a0would like to eliminate\u00a0them completely, compared to just 16% who said they would not, according to an Economist/YouGov poll in November 2021.",
      "\"People across our country are tired of the constant cycle of falling back and springing forward,\" Democratic Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware said, calling it time for a \"thoughtful solution\" across the country.",
      "\"The important thing is that we land of something consistent and make smart investments to keep people safe,\" she said.",
      "\"Time is always complicated and the system we have is complicated, but it's complicated because it's a human creation,\" said Scott Yates, the founder of the Lock the Clock movement, which supports getting rid of twice-yearly time changes.",
      "\"The sun moving around the earth doesn't actually have anything to do with time,\" Yates said. \"We need this system, but this system has this bug right now, and the bug is daylight saving time, the switching of the clocks. And so if we have a little bit of time, a couple of years, so the individual states can address all of these complexities and make those decisions, then we will be able to get rid of this bug permanently. It is something we have been stuck with since World War I, and this is our opportunity to finally fix it.\"",
      "A 2020\u00a0commentary\u00a0for the journal JAMA Neurology found evidence linking the annual transition to daylight saving time to\u00a0increased strokes,\u00a0heart attacks\u00a0and\u00a0teen sleep deprivation.",
      "The Senate in 2022 passed a bill called the Sunshine Protection Act to make daylight saving time permanent, but the bill never went anywhere in the House. The 2022 bill had 17 cosponsors from both parties and was spearheaded by then-Sen. Marco Rubio, who is now the Secretary of State in the Trump administration.",
      "President Trump has given a range of comments about his views. He said in March that it's a \"50/50 issue,\" saying \"it's hard to get excited about it. I assume people would like to have more light later, but some people want to have more light earlier because they don't want to take their kids to school in the dark.\"",
      "But on Friday, after the latest hearing, he posted on social media: \"The House and Senate should push hard for more Daylight at the end of a day. Very popular and, most importantly, no more changing of the clocks, a big inconvenience and, for our government, A VERY COSTLY EVENT!!!\"",
      "In December, he said the \"Republican Party will use its best efforts to eliminate Daylight Saving Time, which has a small but strong constituency, but shouldn't!\"",
      "Mr. Trump in the past had supported making daylight saving time\u00a0permanent \u2014 that is, keeping clocks shifted one hour ahead, which happens in the spring. His\u00a0December comment\u00a0called for daylight saving time to be eliminated.",
      "In addition to Yates, testifying Thursday was Jay Karen, chief executive officer of the National Golf Course Owners Association; Karin Johnson, practicing physician and professor of neurology at UMass Chan School of Medicine Baystate, on behalf of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine; and David Harkey, president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.",

      "Who are the oldest living U.S. presidents?",
      "The oldest living president is Biden, who turned 82 on Nov. 20, 2024, just weeks after the election. Mr. Trump and two former presidents, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, all 78 years old, roughly tied for second.",
      "Who was the longest-living president?",
      "Jimmy Carter who died at the age of 100\u00a0in December 2024, was the oldest living former U.S. president in history. Carter, a Democrat from Georgia, served one term, from 1977 to 1981. He\u00a0broke the longevity milestone in 2019, at 94 years old, surpassing George H.W. Bush to become the longest-living president.",
      "More than 1,000 people recently paid tribute to the former president at a\u00a0benefit concert\u00a0ahead of his centennial. He\u00a0celebrated his 100th birthday\u00a0on Oct. 1, 2024, more than a year after it was announced he had entered hospice care.",

    "published": "Fri, 11 Apr 2025 01:12:00 -0400",
    "summary": "U.S. and Russian intelligence agencies negotiated an agreement to free American Ksenia Karelina in exchange for a Russian detainee.",
    "story": [
      "Russia released Ksenia Karelina, a dual U.S.-Russian national who was sentenced to 12 years in prison for treason in August last year, in a new prison swap on Thursday. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed her release in a social media post early Thursday, but offered no information about the terms of her release.",
      "The Wall Street Journal first reported\u00a0Karelina's release, saying she was freed in a swap arranged by the two countries' intelligence agencies, and a CIA official later told CBS News that the agency had played a central role in the deal on behalf of the U.S. government.",
      "\"American Ksenia Karelina is on a plane back home to the United States,\" Rubio said in his post. \"She was wrongfully detained by Russia for over a year and President Trump secured her release.\"",
      "The plane landed around 11 p.m. EDT at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, where she was greeted by several people including her boyfriend, professional boxer Chris van Heerden. In a touching moment, Karelina and van Heerden had a long embrace.",
      "In a statement first published by the Journal and later provided to CBS News, CIA Director John Ratcliffe said, \"President Trump brought home another wrongfully detained American from Russia,\" and added his praise for \"the CIA officers who worked tirelessly to support this effort\" and for the United Arab Emirate of Abu Dhabi, which he said had enabled the exchange. The swap of the two detainees was carried out in Abu Dhabi.",
      "Ratcliffe was directly involved in the negotiations, which he conducted with an unnamed senior Russian intelligence official, the CIA said.",
      "The top level communication indicates a deepening of efforts by the Trump administration to improve ties with Moscow. Mr. Trump has been pushing both Russia and Ukraine to negotiate a peace agreement to end the three-year war sparked by Russia's ongoing full-scale invasion of its neighbor.",
      "In exchange for Karelina, who lives in California, the CIA official confirmed that the U.S. had freed Arthur Petrov, a German-Russian national arrested in Cyprus 2023 at the request of U.S. authorities. According to the Journal, he was being held on allegations of exporting sensitive microelectronics.",
      "\"Much of the swap was negotiated by the U.S. government, with CIA playing a key role engaging with Russian intelligence,\" a CIA spokesperson said Thursday, adding, \"The exchange shows the importance of keeping lines of communication open with Russia, despite the deep challenges in our bilateral relationship.\"",
      "Karelina was sentenced to 12 years in a Russian penal colony after pleading guilty to treason. She was arrested while on visit to Russia for donating about $51 to an American-based humanitarian group that was helping Ukrainians impacted by the war, according to Russian state media.",
      "Her lawyers said she acknowledged transferring the funds, though she did not admit she intentionally directed them to organizations that might have used the money for actions against Russia. She didn't expect that her donation would end up supporting anti-Russian activities, according to her lawyers.",
      "Van Heerden\u00a0told CBS News last year that she had made the small donation in 2022, \"exercising her First Amendment rights,\" adding that \"she has done nothing wrong.\"",
      "Van Heerden said he was uneasy about Karelina's decision to return to Russia for a visit, given the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, but he said she \"had no worry in the world,\" and that she had assured him it would be safe since she was entering the country as a dual American-Russian citizen.",
      "\"She wanted to go home. She made it very clear that she wanted to go home,\" Van Heerden told Gayle King on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Wanting to fulfill her wish to visit home, Van Heerden said he bought her a plane ticket as a birthday gift, and the pair first traveled together to Istanbul. He had originally intended to travel with her to Russia from there, but he didn't feel comfortable, so she traveled alone to Russia, and he returned to Los Angeles.",
      "Russia imprisoned a number of Americans as tension with Washington soared amid the build up to, and eventually the full-scale war in Ukraine. Paul Whelan, Wall Street Journal reporter\u00a0Evan Gershkovich\u00a0and teacher\u00a0Marc Fogel\u00a0were all designated wrongfully detained like Karelina and freed in previous prisoner swaps with Moscow.",
      "Among the U.S. nationals still jailed in Russia is U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Gordon Black, whose three-year, nine-month prison sentence for robbing and threatening his Russian girlfriend was reduced earlier this week by seven months by a Russian court.",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 23:21:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal immigration official acknowledged last week that the removal of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man, to El Salvador was an \"administrative error.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday said the Trump administration must facilitate the release of a Maryland man mistakenly deported from custody in El Salvador, but ordered additional proceedings before a federal district court.",
      "In an unsigned decision, the high court acknowledged that a late Monday deadline set by the district court judge to secure the return to the U.S. of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, and paused by Chief Justice John Roberts had already passed, effectively granting in part the emergency relief sought by the Trump administration.",
      "But the court said that the district court's order \"properly requires the government to 'facilitate'\" Abrego Garcia's release from Salvadoran custody and to \"ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.\"",
      "The Supreme Court went on to say that the intended scope of the term \"effectuate\" in the lower court's decision is unclear and may exceed its authority. The high court directed the district court to provide more clarification with the case sent back for further proceedings.",
      "\"The district court should clarify its directive, with due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs,\" the court said in an unsigned opinion. \"For its part, the Government should be prepared to share what it can concerning the steps it has taken and the prospect of further steps.\"",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Paula Xinis issued an order Thursday evening following the Supreme Court's decision directing the Trump administration to facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia \"as soon as possible.\"",
      "She gave the Department of Justice until 9:30 a.m. Friday to detail where Abrego Garcia is and the plans to bring him back to the U.S.",
      "There were no noted dissents, and the three liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, noted their respect for the court's disposition of the application. Sotomayor said in a statement joined by Kagan and Jackson that there is agreement among the justices \"that the proper remedy is to provide Abrego Garcia with all the process to which he would have been entitled had he not been unlawfully removed to El Salvador.\"",
      "\"As the Supreme Court correctly recognized, it is the exclusive prerogative of the President to conduct foreign affairs,\" a DOJ spokesperson said Thursday. \"By directly noting the deference owed to the Executive Branch, this ruling once again illustrates that activist judges do not have the jurisdiction to seize control of the President's authority to conduct foreign policy.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers asked the Trump administration in a court filing to facilitate his release from the notorious Salvadoran supermax prison known as CECOT Thursday evening and to dispatch a plane to retrieve him. They cited the \"grave risk to his safety in El Salvador.\"",
      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to step in after a federal district judge on Friday ordered it to take immediate action to return Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. The 29-year-old Salvadoran national was arrested by immigration authorities on March 15 and was among the more than 200 people sent on deportation flights to El Salvador last month.",
      "Abrego Garcia's case sparked backlash after a federal immigration official acknowledged in a court filing last week that his removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error\" and \"oversight.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. illegally in 2011 when he was 16 years old and was arrested in 2019, according to court documents. During immigration proceedings, the Department of Homeland Security claimed that Abrego Garcia was a member of the gang MS-13, citing a Chicago Bulls hat and hoodie he was wearing and allegations from a confidential informant who said he belonged to a branch of MS-13 that operates on Long Island, New York, court records show.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers said he has never lived on Long Island and has no affiliation with MS-13. They also said he has no criminal history and has never been charged or convicted of any criminal offenses in the U.S. or El Salvador.",
      "An immigration judge detained Abrego Garcia after denying a request for release on bond, which was upheld by an immigration appeals board. But he was ultimately granted withholding of removal to El Salvador, a legal status that prohibits the government from returning him to his home country because he is more likely than not to face persecution from local gangs, according to court records.",
      "Abrego Garcia was released from custody following that decision and has lived for six years in Maryland with his wife and their children. He had regular check-ins with immigration authorities, according to court filings, but was arrested on March 12 after he was stopped by immigration agents while driving with his son in the back seat. Abrego Garcia was taken into custody and transported to Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities in Baltimore, Louisiana and Texas before he was flown to El Salvador, according to legal filings.",
      "After Abrego Garcia was sent to the Salvarodan prison last month, he and his wife, a U.S. citizen, filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Maryland alleging his removal violated federal immigration law and seeking an order requiring his return to U.S. custody.",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis granted that request following a hearing Friday and directed the government to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. no later than 11:59 p.m. Monday. The Justice Department asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit to halt that order, and while its request was pending, asked the Supreme Court to intervene. The 4th Circuit then declined to pause the district court's decision.",
      "In a filing with the Supreme Court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that the lower court order \"sets the United States up for failure\" because it interfered with President Trump's ability to conduct foreign diplomacy and set a tight timeline for compliance. He wrote that the U.S. cannot force the release of Abrego Garcia because he is now in the custody of the Salvadoran government.",
      "\"The United States does not control the sovereign nation of El Salvador, nor can it compel El Salvador to follow a federal judge's bidding,\" the solicitor general wrote.",
      "Sotomayor warned in her statement that the government's argument \"implies that it could deport and incarcerate any person, including U. S. citizens, without legal consequence, so long as it does so before a court can intervene.\"",
      "Lawyers for Abrego Garcia called his case \"one of one,\" and argued in court papers that requiring the government to facilitate their client's return is \"not novel,\" because the district court's order just requires the Trump administration to correct its own error.",
      "\"The executive branch may not seize individuals from the streets, deposit them in foreign prisons in violation of court orders, and then invoke the separation of powers to insulate its unlawful actions from judicial scrutiny,\" they wrote.",
      "Abrego Garcia's legal team called the government's mistake in removing him \"Kafka-esque,\" and noted that he has lived in the U.S. for several years without any issues.",
      "\"The government offers no evidence that he has become a threat overnight,\" they wrote.",
      "Migrants removed from the U.S. are being housed in CECOT as a result of a temporary agreement the Trump administration reached with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, under which the U.S. government is paying the Salvadoran government $6 million to hold U.S. detainees for a year.",
      "Citing this arrangement, Abrego Garcia's lawyers argued that the U.S. government \"functionally controls Abrego Garcia's detention \u2014 it has simply contracted with El Salvador to be the jailer.\"",
      "Lower courts also said that the government has control over Abrego Garcia, since he is being temporarily housed in CECOT at the Trump administration's request.",
      "\"The government's claim that it can remove an individual from the United States pursuant to such an agreement and thereby lose the ability to reclaim that individual and return him to the country for process (or for any other purpose) cannot stand,\" Judge Stephanie Thacker, who sits on the 4th Circuit, wrote in an opinion. She added that \"the government's actions in this case most assuredly violated the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.\"",
      "Thacker, who was joined by Judge Robert King, wrote that \"the government cannot escape its responsibility to return Abrego Garcia to the United States by claiming it now lacks authority to control El Salvador.\"",
      "While the Trump administration has acknowledged that it inadvertently sent Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, it has argued that the federal courts do not have the power to demand his return since he's no longer in U.S. custody. Administration officials have also claimed that he is an MS-13 \"leader,\" though they have not produced evidence to support the allegations.",
      "During last week's hearing before Xinis, Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni repeatedly struggled to answer the judge's questions but said he wasn't given sufficient information by the administration.",
      "\"The facts are conceded, plaintiff Abrego Garcia should not have been removed,\" Reuveni said.",
      "When questioned about why the government is not able to return Abrego Garcia, Reuveni said he \"asked the government the same question\" and did not receive an answer. The Justice Department lawyer said multiple times he was \"frustrated\" with the government's lack of cooperation in the case.",
      "Following Friday's argument, Reuveni was placed on administrative leave, and Sauer said in a filing that his statements were \"inappropriate\" and \"do not reflect the position of the United States.\"",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News about Reuveni's employment status, Attorney General Pam Bondi said, \"At my direction, every Department of Justice attorney is required to zealously advocate on behalf of the United States. Any attorney who fails to abide by this direction will face consequences.\"",

    "story": [
      "Faced with a deadline to provide evidence in its deportation case against activist Mahmoud Khalil, lawyers for the federal government instead filed a memorandum by Secretary of State Marco Rubio to a Louisiana immigration court.",
      "In the memo, which was obtained by CBS News, Rubio wrote that Khalil's role in protests on the campus of Columbia University is in conflict with American foreign policy objectives. Rubio did not cite specific evidence against Khalil. He stated that Khalil is deportable under a little-known statute in federal immigration law that provides the government is entitled to deport noncitizens whose presence in the U.S. damages national foreign policy interests.",
      "Rubio argued that the presence of Khalil, a 30-year-old legal permanent resident, undermines \"U.S. policy to combat anti-Semitism around the world and in the United States, in addition to efforts to protect Jewish students from harassment and violence in the United States.\"",
      "Khalil was a prominent voice in the spring 2024 pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University, where he earned a master's degree from the School of International and Public Affairs in December 2024. He was detained by federal immigration authorities at his university-owned apartment as his pregnant wife looked on. He was moved from New York to a detention center in New Jersey before being flown to a remote facility in Jena, Louisiana.",
      "The government claims that Khalil has supported Hamas, and can be deported if it is determined his presence and activities threaten the foreign policy interests of the U.S., citing alleged support for Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group. To date, CBS News has not found evidence that Khalil has said he supports Hamas.",
      "Assistant chief immigration Judge Jamee Comans on Tuesday said she would terminate the case unless the government showed evidence supporting the removal of the former Columbia student. Khalil's attorney Marc Van Der Hout said at the hearing that he had \"not received a single document\" of evidence from the government.",
      "\"I'd like to see the evidence,\" Comans said, demanding that the government make a filing within 24 hours.",
      "In response, the Department of Homeland Security submitted the two-page memo from Rubio, which includes references to Khalil and one other lawful permanent resident whose name was redacted.",
      "Rubio wrote that they should be removed from the country because their \"presence or activities would compromise a compelling U.S. foreign policy interest.\"",
      "\"The foreign policy of the United States champions core American interests and American citizens,\" he continued, \"and condoning anti-Semitic conduct and disruptive protests in the United States would severely undermine that significant foreign policy objective.\"",
      "Rubio pointed to Khalil's participation in what he descirbed as \"antisemitic protests and disruptive activities,\" which he said creates a \"hostile environment for Jewish students,\" as well as \"unlawful activity\" during those protests.",
      "\"The government can't just operate on hidden law based on one executive official's say so,\" said Baher Azmy, Legal Director of the Center of Constitutional Rights during a press call about Khalil on Thursday. \"Does anyone here know what conduct they would have to engage in that would trigger an adverse foreign policy interest to The United States? No one does. No one can. Which is what's so dangerous about this law.\"",
      "Comans has set a removability hearing for Khalil on Friday at 1 p.m., at which she could determine whether sufficient evidence has been provided to support the continuation of his immigration case.",
      "The government had previously said Khalil should be expelled for what it's described as \"material support\" for the militant group Hamas via his role in campus protests against Israel.",
      "Khalil's attorneys, who have also sued the government on his behalf, lambasted the government, saying the government was depriving him of his right to free speech.",
      "\"After a month of hiding the ball since Mahmoud's late-night unjust arrest in New York and taking him away to a remote detention center in Louisiana, immigration authorities have finally admitted that they have no case whatsoever against him,\" said Van Der Hout. \"Instead, the government is clearly going after Mahmoud and persecuting him for exercising his First Amendment rights.\"",
      "After Khalil's arrest, President Trump said it was just the first \"of many to come.\" His statement heralded a crackdown on students and alleged \"agitators\" who have protested against Israel.",
      "Foreign-born students across the country have since faced the knocks of immigration agents at the door, and deportation proceedings.",
      "\"If the secretary of state claims the power to arrest, detain and deport someone, including a lawful permanent resident, simply because that person dissents from US foreign policy, there are no limits. There's no beginning and no end to that kind of executive power,\" said Johnny Sinodis, an attorney for Khalil's immigration case.",
      "\"This is not a routine immigration case or even routine habeas case,\" he added. \"This case is intentionally projecting a message of repression about who can say what in this country and the consequences to your liberty and your life if you object to U.S. policy.\""

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/save-act-voter-registration-citizenship-married-women-name-change/",
    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 16:36:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The SAVE Act could change voter registration requirements for millions of people. Here's how.",
    "story": [
      "A claim circulating on social media suggests that married people who changed their last name will face difficulties when trying to vote under the proposed Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act.",
      "Experts say the bill, which\u00a0passed in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday, April 10, would not explicitly prevent these voters from casting a ballot, but it could create barriers to registration by requiring them to show additional documentation.",
      "The measure now heads to the Senate. If it passes in the Senate and is\u00a0signed into law, the act would amend the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, which requires states\u00a0to offer voter registration when obtaining a driver's license, to mandate documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration.",
      "This means that common forms of ID used for voter registration, including driver's licenses, would no longer be accepted as they are not generally considered proof of citizenship. Instead, voters would have to present documents such as a U.S. passport, a birth certificate, or naturalization paperwork to register.",
      "The Center for American Progress analysis estimated as many as 69 million have taken their spouse's name but do not have a matching birth certificate. \"The fate of those 69 million women are basically up in the air, the way the bill is written,\" said Greta Bedekovics, associate director of democracy policy at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy and advocacy group.",
      "Opponents argue that the law could also make voting more difficult for military and rural voters by upending both mail-in and online voter registration. Bedekovic said it would make an in-person trip to the election office the only \"viable way for Americans across the country to register to vote,\" adding that rural voters are less likely to have a passport and may have to travel hours to obtain and submit documents.",
      "According to Congress.gov, the bill also \"establishes criminal penalties\" for registering someone who does not have the right documents to vote.",
      "Eliza Sweren-Becker, senior counsel in the Brennan Center's Voting Rights and Elections Program, noted that the bill \"does not specify what extra documents\" married individuals would need to produce, adding that \"election officials, who would face legal risks under the bill, would be hesitant to register women whose documentation name does not match their current name.\"",
      "\"This in-person 'show your papers' requirement would keep many eligible voters out of the voting booth \u2014 beyond the millions who already lack ready access to their citizenship documents \u2014 and cause chaos for election administration,\" said Sweren-Becker.",
      "As of January 2025, eight states require proof of citizenship to register to vote, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Americans widely support both voter ID requirements and proof of citizenship. A\u00a02024 Gallup survey found more than 4 in 5 respondents supported proof of citizenship requirements for first-time voters.",
      "Supporters of the bill, including U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly, a Republican from Pennsylvania, argue that it is necessary to prevent noncitizens from voting.",
      "However,\u00a0noncitizen voting is already illegal and rare. In a study following the 2016 election, the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice found just 30 suspected cases of noncitizen voting out of 23.5 million votes cast in the 42 jurisdictions reviewed.",
      "A 2023 Pew Research survey found\u00a0that about 80% of women married to men in the U.S. take their husband's last name. Under the SAVE Act, if their voter registration name differs from the name on their birth certificate or passport, they may need to show additional documents.",
      "If the SAVE Act were to become law, Bedekovics said married women who have changed their names should obtain certified copies of all marriage certificates, locate their birth certificates, and keep any change-of-name documentation on hand for any updates to their voter registration.",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 16:14:04 -0400",
    "summary": "The vote was initially delayed amid conservatives' concerns about the level of spending cuts.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House on Thursday adopted a budget blueprint for President Trump's agenda after Republican leaders scrambled to convince GOP holdouts who want deeper spending cuts to back it.",
      "The resolution was adopted in a 216-214 vote, with two Republicans \u2014 Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Victoria Spartz of Indiana \u2014 joining all Democrats to vote against it.",
      "About a dozen House conservatives ultimately flipped their opposition after receiving assurances from leaders that the Senate would pursue $1.5 trillion in savings, at a minimum.",
      "\"Our two chambers are directly aligned,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said before the vote. \"We're committed to finding at least $1.5 trillion in savings for the American people while also preserving our essential programs.\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, echoed that the Senate is \"aligned with the House in terms of what their budget resolution outlined in terms of savings.\"",
      "\"The speaker talked about $1.5 trillion dollars. We have a lot of United States senators who believe that is a minimum,\" Thune said.",
      "The lower chamber was set to vote Wednesday evening on the budget resolution but punted after several House conservatives resisted increasing pressure from Mr. Trump to accept the blueprint that would open the door to implementing his border security, defense, energy priorities and extending expiring tax cuts.",
      "Approving the budget plan in both chambers is the first step in the reconciliation process, which allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold required to advance most legislation in the Senate and pass Mr. Trump's agenda with a simple majority. Going that route allows Republicans, who have control of the House and Senate, to pass the measure without any support from Democrats.",
      "The House and Senate worked on separate blueprints earlier this year but more recently reached a compromise resolution, which the Senate adopted early Saturday morning. Republican leaders in the House worked to unite their divided party behind the budget plan this week before Congress leaves town for a two-week recess.",
      "The Senate set much lower minimum floors for spending cuts at just about $4 billion, though committees could find far more. The compromise resolution also allows for the House to slash at least $1.5 trillion in spending.",
      "The Senate also wants to account for tax cuts enacted during Mr. Trump's first term with a tactic known as \"current policy baseline,\" which assumes that continuing expiring policies will cost nothing. Under that baseline, the nearly $4 trillion it would cost to extend the 2017 tax cuts would not be counted, further frustrating House conservatives.",
      "Johnson said House and Senate committees would be working in a \"collaborative fashion\" over the two-week recess to find savings.",
      "Before backing the resolution, House conservatives wanted assurances from the Senate that there will be deeper spending cuts, which sent leadership scrambling to find another compromise.",
      "\"We just don't trust the Senate,\" Rep. Eric Burlison, a Missouri Republican, told reporters Wednesday night after fiscal hawks huddled with Johnson for more than hour as the vote was delayed. \"We all campaign on spending cuts, but again and again, that doesn't happen. And when the Senate sent over something that said $4 billion is their floor, that was unacceptable to a lot of us.\"",
      "Burlison was among those who changed their minds and voted in favor of the resolution. Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas said he and other holdouts were moved to support the resolution by a White House commitment to making \"significant cuts,\" Johnson's \"firm commitment\" to maintain House Republicans' framework of tying tax cuts to spending cuts and Thune's \"strong statement\" promising at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts.",
      "Massie, one of the two Republicans who held firm on his \"no\" vote, called it \"a framework for financial collapse.\"",
      "\"I don't believe they're going to make any cuts of any consequence. Now they may change spending, reduce spending here, and increase spending there, but overall, the money spent next year is going to be more than the money spent this year,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump increased pressure on House Republicans in recent days to swallow the blueprint, telling holdouts on Tuesday night, \"close your eyes and get there.\" He added that individual lawmakers may not get \"every little ounce\" of what they want in the legislation.",
      "\"It's a phenomenal bill. Stop grandstanding,\" Mr. Trump said at the House GOP campaign arm's fundraising dinner.",
      "Democrats have railed against the proposed cuts, arguing the Republican plan will lead to massive cuts in entitlement programs such as Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security.",
      "\"The budget resolution that passed the House today will set in motion some of the most extreme cuts to health care, nutritional assistance and the things that matter to everyday Americans in our nation's nearly 250-year history,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said Thursday. \"It's a disgrace.\"",

      "Wynn-Williams began working at Meta, then known as Facebook, as the director of Global Public Policy in 2011. In her almost seven years with the company, Wynn-Williams told the panel she witnessed the company provide \"custom built censorship tools\" for the Chinese Communist Party. She said a Chinese dissident living in the United States was removed from Facebook in 2017 after pressure from Chinese officials. Facebook said at the time it took action against the regime critic, Guo Wengui, for sharing someone else's personal information.",
      "Wynn-Williams described the use of a \"virality counter\" that flagged posts with over 10,000 views for review by a \"chief editor,\" which Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut called \"an Orwellian censor.\" These \"virality counters\" were used not only in Mainland China, but also in Hong Kong and Taiwan, according to Wynn-Williams's testimony.",

Routh aimed his rifle at an agent, who opened fire, which led Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing, they said.",
      "Uthmeier, a Republican, criticized the Biden administration, accusing it of trying to \"frustrate our efforts\" and \"block\" his office's investigation. He lauded FBI director Kash Patel and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi for being willing to \"work together to pursue justice.\"",
      "Routh is jailed on federal charges of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, possessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, assaulting a federal officer, being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition, and possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number.",
      "He is due in court on the federal charges in September. The lag between his arrest and his next court date was granted to give his attorneys time to review hundreds of hours of footage from police body cameras and surveillance cameras, and to pore over material from Routh's 17 cellphones and other electronic devices.",
      "On Tuesday, the government submitted new evidence against Routh, alleging that in March and April 2024, Routh spent over a week in West Palm Beach, \"engaging in apparent reconnaissance for his assassination attempt.\"",
      "\"Routh's acidity is undeniably necessary context for the jury to understand the significance of Routh's conduct on September 15 at Trump International because it shows his planning for what happened that day and his familiarity with locations he revisited on and leading up to September 15, including the South Bay area where he camped in the weeks beforehand, and Southern Boulevard, the main road from South Bay to Trump International,\" the government wrote in the court documents.",
      "The government also alleged that Routh sought to acquire anti-aircraft weapons to shoot down Mr. Trump's plane.",

      "Ambassador Brink has not responded to a request for comment.",
      "One senior U.S. official told CBS that her resignation stems from an unusual mix of personal and policy concerns, including the recent USAID layoffs. Brink is serving in a war zone far from her family, since Kyiv is designated as an unaccompanied post, where officers serve without bringing their families with them.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio intended to keep Brink, a career foreign service officer, in the job and declined the initial resignation she had submitted in January as part of the standard turnover between administrations.",
      "Brink's resignation comes at a pivotal moment for U.S.-Ukraine relations. The Trump administration has tried to broker an end to the Russian invasion in part by ending the policy of diplomatically isolating Vladimir Putin, who invaded Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "While Ukraine accepted a U.S. ceasefire proposal, Russia has not. It is not clear whether President Trump has set any deadline for conclusion of the diplomacy, but he's continuing to have special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff at the fore of outreach to Russia.",

Mr. Trump told Zelenskyy to reach a ceasefire agreement with Russia or \"we're out,\" and Vice President JD Vance accused the Ukrainian president of being \"disrespectful\" after he challenged the vice president's assertion that the war had dragged on because of a lack of diplomacy from Ukraine and the Biden administration. Vice President JD Vance also admonished Zelensky: \"Have you said 'thank you' once, this entire meeting?\"",
      "The Trump administration subsequently paused military and intelligence aid to Ukraine amid the fallout. That intelligence support resumed once Ukraine agreed to go along with the Trump administration's outreach to Putin. Mr. Trump continues to sit on the nearly $4 billion in remaining U.S. military aid already designated for Ukraine. The U.S. has been a key supplier of weapons since the Russian invasion began.",

      "Immediately after Mr. Trump announced the pause, the U.S. stock market surged. It had fallen significantly after the president's initial announcement on the tariffs. A universal tariff of 10% remained in place for nearly every country, except China, which faces an even higher tariff of 125%. China raised its own tariffs against the U.S.",
      "Horsford pressed Greer for details of the pause.",
      "\"I understand it's 90 days. I haven't spoken to the president since I've been in this hearing,\" Greer said.",
      "Horsford interrupted, \"So the trade representative hasn't spoken to the president of the United States about a global re-ordering of trade?\"",
      "\"Yes I have, I'm just here in a hearing with you,\" Greer interjected.",
      "\"And yet he announced it on a tweet? W.T.F.? Who's in charge?\" Horsford yelled.",
      "\"The president of the United States is in charge,\" Greer said.",
      "\"And what do you know about those details?\" Horsford asked. Before Greer could answer, he said, \"It looks like your boss just pulled the rug out from under you.\"",
      "\"There's no strategy,\" Horsford said. \"You just found out. Three seconds ago. Sitting here. We saw you. If you came here knowing that you were going to be turned off, that these tariffs were going to be turned off, why didn't you include that in your opening statement? Why didn't you reference that as part of your testimony?\"",
      "Greer repeated he doesn't disclose his conversations with the president.",
      "\"These were specific questions we asked you all along,\" Horsford said. \"What's the strategy? These are real consequences for the American people and small businesses. \u2026 This is amateur hour and it needs to stop. What does this even mean for your negotiating strategy? How are you in charge of negotiation if the president is tweeting about this from wherever the hell he is?\"",
      "\"The president was elected and he runs the trade policy and I advise him and execute his policy,\" Greer said.",
      "\"Did you know that this was happening?\" Horsford pressed.",
      "\"We had been discussing all kinds of options, Sir,\" Greer said.",
      "\"There was no strategy. There was no plan,\" Horsford said, adding that Mr. Trump \"put our economy in disarray and near collapse.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued the tariffs were a \"negotiating strategy.\"",
      "Horsford asked Greer if this was market manipulation.",
      "When Greer answered, \"No,\" Horsford, said \"Why not? If it was a plan. If it was always the plan, how is this not market manipulation?\"",
      "\"We're trying to reset the global trade system,\" Greer said.",
      "\"And what has that done? How have you achieved any of that? But to enact enormous harm on the American people?\" Horsford said. \"Tariffs are a tool. It can be used in the appropriate way to protect U.S. jobs and small businesses, but that's not what this does, so if it's not market manipulation, what is it? Who's benefitting? What billionaire just got richer?\"",
      "Horsford then slammed Republicans for their budget plan and repeated to Greer, \"Who's in charge? Because it sure doesn't look like it's the trade representative. You just got the rug pulled out from under you.\"",
      "\"I wish I could feel some empathy, but the empathy I have is for the American people whose very wellbeing and livelihoods are being effected. This is not a game. This is real life,\" Horsford said before yielding his time.",

This is to ensure that HHS better serves the American people at the highest and most efficient standard,\" HHS spokesperson Vianca Rodriguez Feliciano said in a statement.",
      "In addition to the blood disorders division, Kennedy's layoffs wiped out the entire leadership team atop CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities that housed it. Support staff for the center, as well as its Disability and Health Promotion Branch, were also cut.",

      "A now-stalled upcoming release of data had been expected to help shed light on a recent increase in cognitive disability among younger adults, an official said.",
      "\"There seems to be a step back to see developmental disabilities, like autism, being only in childhood. The branch provided key public health expertise for disability in adulthood, where people spend most of their lives,\" said a current CDC official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",

      "Also eliminated in the cuts were CDC staff overseeing a partnership with the Special Olympics \u2014 an organization founded by Kennedy's aunt, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, and now chaired by his cousin, Timothy Shriver.

    "story": [
      "In what could be a key 2025 bellwether, Virginia's race for governor will also make history, all but guaranteeing the Commonwealth's first female governor. Democrat Abigail Spanberger, a former congresswoman and CIA officer, will face Republican Lt. Governor Winsome Earle-Sears, a Marine veteran, after both state parties confirmed their nominees in recent days.",
      "One of the only competitive races of the year, the Virginia gubernatorial contest will be closely watched by both parties \u2014 and is often treated as a referendum on the president's party. Historically, Virginia has voted for a governor of the opposite political party, every time a new president has been elected since 1977.",
      "The race is already breaking state records for fundraising, with Earle-Sears raising more than $3 million from January to March and Spanberger raising around $6.7 million during the same period, according to the campaigns.",
      "In an interview with \"America Decides,\" Spanberger told CBS News she believes national issues will weigh heavily on the race, from the Trump administration's mass layoffs of federal employees, more than 144,000 of whom live in Virginia, as well as what she called an \"antagonistic trade war.\"",
      "\"All of this impacts Virginia, and the stakes of this election reflect that,\" said Spanberger.",
      "When asked whether Earle-Sears supports President Trump's tariff policy, her campaign deflected but said in a statement, \"After leftists like Joe Biden and Abigail Spanberger devastated our economy and standing in the world\u2014President Trump is doing the work to put America first again.\"",
      "Earle-Sears has attacked Spanberger for her votes in Congress supporting Biden administration policies including the Inflation Reduction Act, which passed in 2022 with no Republican support. Earle-Sears argues it has contributed to inflation.",
      "\"I think it's a ridiculous assertion given that my opponent has been eager to claim credit for some of the funding that came through some of those federal dollars to Virginia's Commonwealth,\" Spanberger told CBS News. \"But, the reality is that my opponent is endeavoring to distract, because she's not talking about the fact that we've seen an absolute tanking of the stock market because of Donald Trump's actions.\"",
      "While the economy is a top issue for Virginians and both candidates, advocates are also hoping gun safety mobilizes voters.",
      "Spanberger is set to receive the endorsement of Everytown for Gun Safety Thursday, the group first told CBS News. Everytown, established by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, is also contributing $1 million to the race, which will include organizing efforts and political ads.",
      "Spanberger herself became a volunteer for pro-gun control group Moms Demand Action after leaving the CIA.",
      "\"Abigail Spanberger understands that common-sense laws to keep guns out of dangerous hands are crucial to ensuring public safety,\" John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, said of the endorsement.",
      "Everytown also points to their success at the state legislative level in 2023 when nine gun safety volunteers won races and helped flip the House of Delegates, the lower house of Virginia's legislature, to Democratic control.",
      "The group says internal polling from that year revealed it's a top three issue for Virginia voters in battleground districts across Northern Virginia, Richmond and Hampton Roads.",
      "Youngkin vetoed an assault weapons ban and other gun control bills that passed the state legislature last year.",
      "He did sign two other gun measures, including one that bans auto sears, a device that converts semi-automatic handguns into automatic weapons. He also signed \"Lucia's Law,\" making it a crime for parents who allow children deemed as threats to access firearms.",
      "Earle-Sears has supported the governor's vetoes.",
      "In 2021, Earle-Sears became the first Black woman ever elected to statewide office in Virginia. She will have to appeal to moderates and independent voters in the blue-leaning state but has given mixed messages on her support for Mr. Trump in recent years.",
      "In 2020, she co-chaired the group \"Black Americans to re-elect President Trump,\" but in 2022, following the midterms, she told FOX Business it was \"time to move on.\"",
      "\"A true leader understands when they have become a liability,\" she said during the interview. \"A true leader understands when it's time to step off the stage.\"",
      "She went on to vote for Mr. Trump in 2024. A source close to the campaign says she sees the president as a federal partner. It remains to be seen if Mr. Trump offers Earle-Sears an endorsement given the high stakes of this year's few marquee races.",
      "While Mr. Trump made inroads in Virginia during the 2024 presidential election, the state comfortably went for Vice President Kamala Harris in November.",

      "So far, the only known Denisovan fossils include partial jawbones, a few teeth and part of a finger bone found in caves in Siberia and Tibet. Some scientists believe fossils found in a cave in Laos may also belong to Denisovans.",
      "The probable identification of the jawbone from Taiwan as Denisovan expands the region where scientists know these ancient people once lived, said Tsutaya.",
      "\"Denisovans must therefore have been capable of adapting to a wide range of habitat types,\" study co-author Frido Welker told the Reuters news agency.",
      "The partial jawbone was first recovered when a fishing operation dredged the seafloor in the Penghu Channel near the Taiwan Strait. After it was sold to an antique shop, a collector spotted it and purchased it in 2008, then later donated it to Taiwan's National Museum of Natural Science.",
      "Based on the composition of marine invertebrates found attached to it, the fossil was dated to the Pleistocene era. But exactly which species of early human ancestor it belonged to remained a mystery.",
      "The condition of the fossil made it impossible to study ancient DNA. But recently, scientists in Taiwan, Japan and Denmark were able to extract some protein sequences from the incomplete jawbone.",
      "An analysis showed some protein sequences resembled those contained in the genome of a Denisovan fossil recovered in Siberia. The findings were published in the journal Science.",
      "While the new research is promising, Rick Potts, director of the Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Project, said he would like to see further data before confirming the Taiwan fossil as Denisovan.",
      "Potts, who was not involved in the new research, praised the study for \"a fantastic job of recovering some proteins.\" But he added, such a small sliver of material may not give a full picture.",
      "At one time, at least three human ancestor groups - Denisovans, Neanderthals and Homo sapiens - coexisted in Eurasia and sometimes interbred, researchers say.",
      "\"We can identity Neanderthal elements and Denisovan elements\" in the DNA of some people alive today, said Tsutaya.",
      "Scientists still don't know exactly why Denisovans went extinct.",
      "\"We have so little archaeological and fossil information about Denisovans that we can only speculate as to why they disappeared,\" Welker told Reuters. \"A lasting legacy, though, is that some human populations in East and Southeast Asia carry some Denisovan ancestry in their genomes today.\"",

      "\"The remains of three children not older than 4 years were found on three sides of the altar,\" Paiz told The Associated Press.",
      "\"The Teotihuacan were traders who traveled all over the country (Guatemala),\" Paiz said. \"The Teotihuacan residential complexes were houses with rooms and in the center altars; that's what the residence that was found is like, with an altar with the figure representing the Storm Goddess.\"",

      "Mar\u00eda Bel\u00e9n M\u00e9ndez, an archaeologist who was not involved with the project, said the discovery confirms \"that there has been an interconnection between both cultures and what their relationships with their gods and celestial bodies was like.\"",
      "\"We see how the issue of sacrifice exists in both cultures. It was a practice; it's not that they were violent, it was their way of connecting with the celestial bodies,\" she said.",
      "The altar is just over a yard wide from east to west and about 2 yards from north to south. It is about a yard tall and covered with limestone.",

      "\"It is very daunting when you think about the small number of people that have actually done it. I still get very uncomfortable when people say, 'astronaut,'\" King said. \"I in no means feel like an astronaut. They said, 'But, Gayle, if you go to space, you're an astronaut.'\"",
      "King said traveling to space was never her dream, but she considered the opportunity and message it would send.",
      "\"There was something about being part of the first female team to me,\" King said. \"The group of women that they put together is so extraordinary to me that I thought, 'Wow. Why would I not wanna be a part of that?'\"",
      "King, who turned 70 in December, said she never thought this experience would have been possible just 6 months ago.",

      "\"Luca's 3, so he understands. \u2026 He'll be 4 in September, so he knows Gaila's going on a rocket ship and he wanted to go.\"",

      "Millions of Americans witnessed a total solar eclipse chart its way across the United States in 2024. Viewers in\u00a0the path of totality\u00a0saw the moon completely block the sun.",
      "The awe-inspiring experience won't happen in the U.S. again until 2044, with only three states in the path, and 2045, with more than a dozen states in the path.",
      "\"A total solar eclipse is one of the most spectacular things anyone can see in their lifetime,\" Virginia Tech astrophysicist Nahum Arav told CBS News. The eclipse \"looks like a black hole in the sky,\" said Arav, who watched the paths of totality of eclipses in 1991 and 2017.",
      "The 2024 eclipse started on the Pacific Coast of Mexico, and then moved into Texas. The eclipse's visibility tracked\u00a0through 15 states\u00a0\u2014 Oklahoma, Illinois, Ohio,\u00a0Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont,\u00a0New Hampshire\u00a0and Maine, among them \u2014 before heading northward into Canada and then exiting North America.",

      "When is the next total solar eclipse in the U.S. after the 2024 eclipse?",
      "Solar eclipses happen about twice a year, said Arav. \"Eclipses happen all over the Earth evenly,\" he told CBS News \u2014 but noted the timings when they occur are not regular. That means\u00a0eclipses can occur within just a few years, or every few decades, in North America.",
      "Before the eclipse in 2024, the last total solar eclipses visible from the U.S. were in 2017 and\u00a01979. The 2017 solar eclipse was the first whose path of totality crossed the entire continent in 99 years.",
      "Even though eclipses may seem to occur randomly, scientists can pinpoint exactly when and where they will happen.",
      "\"There is no ambiguity, as we know exactly where it will land,\" said Arav.",
      "There will be eight total solar eclipses visible from parts of the continental U.S. in the 21st century, Arav said, with one occurring about every 12 years, on average.",
      "The next one is predicted to occur on Aug. 23, 2044, NASA said. However, the path of totality from this eclipse will only touch three states, according to\u00a0The Planetary Society, a nonprofit organization dedicated to public interest in space.",
      "This next eclipse will mainly be observed in Canada, Arav said.",
      "Path of totality for the 2044 total solar eclipse",
      "The 2044 eclipse will start in Greenland on Aug. 23, 2044, and will continue its path through Canada.",
      "The total solar eclipse will be short, mostly appearing in Canada. It will be visible from just three states in the U.S.: Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota.",
      "The path of totality will cross Williston and Dickinson, North Dakota, and Great Falls, Montana.",
      "Path of totality for the 2045 total solar eclipse",
      "The next solar eclipse that crosses a significant portion of the continental U.S. will be in 2045, said Arav. That year, a solar eclipse on Aug. 12 will darken skies in parts of the U.S., Haiti, Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Guyana, French Guiana, Suriname and Brazil.",
      "It will be visible in many states as it moves from coast to coast. The eclipse will start in California and move east to end in Florida, similar to 2017, Arav said.",
      "There will be numerous U.S. cities where eclipse watchers can view the total eclipse, including Reno, Nevada; Colorado Springs, Colorado; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Little Rock, Arkansas; Jackson, Mississippi; and Orlando, Florida.",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 14:34:07 -0400",
    "summary": "Meta whistleblower Sarah Wynn-Williams testified Wednesday afternoon before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism.",
    "story": [
      "Meta whistleblower Sarah Wynn-Williams told senators in testimony Wednesday on Capitol Hill that the social media company worked \"hand in glove\" with the Chinese government to censor its platforms, among other allegations.",
      "\"I saw Meta executives repeatedly undermine U.S. national security and betray American values,\" Wynn-Williams said in her opening remarks, which were obtained by CBS News before the hearing.",
      "Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism and led the bipartisan hearing, said Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg \"made censorship his business model.\"",
      "\"The evidence that we have in black and white is a company and leadership that is willing to do anything, anything, work with America's chief competitor, work with our chief adversary,\" Hawley said.",
      "Hawley sent a letter to Zuckerberg Thursday requesting his testimony before the subcommittee, writing, \"The American people deserve to know the truth about your company.\"",
      "Wynn-Williams began working at Meta, then known as Facebook, as the director of Global Public Policy in 2011. In her almost seven years with the company, Wynn-Williams told the panel she witnessed the company provide \"custom built censorship tools\" for the Chinese Communist Party. She said a Chinese dissident living in the United States was removed from Facebook in 2017 after pressure from Chinese officials. Facebook said at the time it took action against the regime critic, Guo Wengui, for sharing someone else's personal information.",
      "Wynn-Williams described the use of a \"virality counter\" that flagged posts with over 10,000 views for review by a \"chief editor,\" which Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut called \"an Orwellian censor.\" These \"virality counters\" were used not only in Mainland China, but also in Hong Kong and Taiwan, according to Wynn-Williams's testimony.",
      "Wynn-Williams also told senators Chinese officials could \"potentially access\" the data of American users. When Meta engineers expressed concern about data security, Wynn-Williams testified that Meta leadership, including Zuckerberg, were indifferent.",
      "Wynn-Williams testified Zuckerberg was \"personally invested\" in Meta's business relationship with China, claiming he committed to learning Mandarin and \"had weekly Mandarin sessions with employees.\"",
      "Wynn-Williams alleged Meta's artificial intelligence model known as \"Llama\" was used to help DeepSeek. DeepSeek is a Chinese AI company that sent shockwaves through the American technology industry earlier this year when its AI model was shown to be competitive with OpenAI's ChatGPT at a fraction of the cost.",
      "In a statement last year on Llama, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone wrote, \"The alleged role of a single and outdated version of an American open-source model is irrelevant when we know China is already investing over 1T to surpass the US technologically, and Chinese tech companies are releasing their own open AI models as fast, or faster, than US ones.\"",
      "Wynn-Williams encouraged senators to continue investigating Meta's role in the development of artificial intelligence in China, as they continue their probe into the social media company founded by Zuckerberg.",
      "\"The greatest trick Mark Zuckerberg ever pulled was wrapping the American flag around himself and calling himself a patriot and saying he didn't offer services in China, while he spent the last decade building an $18 billion business there,\" she said.",
      "In response to her opening statement, a Meta spokesperson called Wynn-Williams' testimony \"divorced from reality and riddled with false claims.\"",
      "\"While Mark Zuckerberg himself was public about our interest in offering our services in China and details were widely reported beginning over a decade ago, the fact is this: we do not operate our services in China today,\" Meta said in a statement.",
      "Meta, which changed its name from Facebook in 2021, operates some of the most popular social media platforms in the United States, including its previous namesake Facebook as well as Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads.",
      "Washington is taking a more aggressive posture toward China and its growing threat to American economic interests and national security. The Trump administration increased tariffs on imported goods from China to 125% Wednesday. The administration also continues to pursue the sale of TikTtok, a short-form video platform owned by Chinese company ByteDance, to an American buyer. And on Capitol Hill in 2023, the House of Representatives created the Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party to investigate China's challenge to American global power.",
      "In March, Wynn-Williams published a memoir called \"Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed and Lost Idealism\" about her time at Meta.",

      "The technology giant has taken a number of steps to mitigate the impact of President Trump's steep tariffs on China. That includes ramping up iPhone production in India, which is subject to far lower levies than China, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week. Apple continues to make most iPhones in China.",
      "Apple has added workers in its main India factory, extending shifts to reach its goal of ramping up production by 20%, Reuters reported.",
      "Mr. Trump on April 2 announced a 27% tariff on India, which Mr. Trump on Wednesday\u00a0paused for 90 days\u00a0along with import taxes on dozens of other countries as the U.S. seeks to negotiate more favorable trade deals. By contrast, a 125% \"reciprocal tariff\" on China remains in effect.",
      "Apple chartered cargo flights to transport the smartphones to the U.S. because it \"wanted to beat the tariff,\" a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Apple reportedly spent eight months lobbying Indian airport authorities to cut the phones' customs clearance time down from 30 hours to six hours. The company has chartered about six cargo jets since March, Reuters reported, citing two sources, including an senior Indian government official.",

Recent data from UBS Investment Research shows that a 125% tariff on Chinese imports could lift the retail cost of an iPhone 16 Pro Max 256 GB, which is assembled in China, as much as 67%, lifting the price $800 from $1,199 to $1,999.",

      "In a move that threatens to raise costs on all electronics, including iPhones, the White House on Tuesday said it would follow through on a threat to enact a 104% tariff on all Chinese goods imported into the U.S. The levy took effect Wednesday at 12:01 a.m. EDT. Later Wednesday, Mr. Trump raised the tariff rate to 125%, effective immediately.",
      "The price for the popular tech tool, which starts at $599 for the most basic model, the iPhone 16e, is poised to increase by hundreds of dollars, depending on how Apple responds to the sweeping levies. The iPhone 16 Pro 128 GB, which features Apple Intelligence, costs $999.",
      "The iPhone accounts for about half of Apple's revenue. Most of its smartphones are manufactured in China.",
      "Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives said in a research note Tuesday that the added levies could create a \"category 5 price storm\" for personal electronics and other gadgets. Taxing China and other nations at such rates is the equivalent of \"flipping a boat upside down in the ocean with no life rafts,\" he added.",
      "How much more could an iPhone cost?",
      "The iPhone 16 Pro Max 256 GB, which is among the devices that are assembled in China, retails for $1,199. Under the new tariffs on Chinese imports, the price of the device could rise by $675, or 56%, lifting the price tag to $1,874, an April 9 analysts from UBS Investment Research shows.",
      "The cost of an iPhone 16 Pro 128 GB, which is made in India and costs $999, could increase to $1,119, an increase of 12%, the investment bank found.",

      "Apple didn't respond to a request for comment on how the Trump tariffs could affect iPhone prices.",
      "What if Apple moved production to the U.S.?",
      "President Trump has said the new U.S. tariffs are aimed at spurring both domestic and foreign companies to build in the U.S. But for Apple and other companies, manufacturing their products in the U.S. entail significantly higher labor costs \u2014 costs that would largely be passed on to consumers.",
      "If Apple were to begin assembling iPhones in the U.S, a Chinese-made device that previously sold for $1,000 would cost $3,500 if manufactured in New Jersey, Texas or some other state, Ives estimated.",
      "\"Saying we can just make this in the USA is a statement that incredibly understates the complexity of the Asia supply chain and the way electronics, chips, semi fabs, hardware, smartphones, etc. are made for U.S. consumers over the last 30 years,\" he said in a report.",
      "As a result, Ives is highly skeptical that tariffs alone will lead companies to shift their manufacturing plants from low-cost havens like China to the U.S., calling the idea \"absurd.\"",
      "But some companies, including Apple, could attempt to rejigger supply chains to avoid the steepest tariffs. For example, Apple plans to manufacture more iPhones in India to reduce its reliance on China, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported, citing people familiar with the matter.",

      "One of the last memories Reggie has of that day is his mother buying him a chocolate chip cookie at the Hammond Square Mall. He also remembers her kissing him goodbye but everything else is a blur.",
      "\"48 Hours\" and contributor Vladimir Duthiers investigate what happened in the decades that followed in \"The Day My Mother Never Came Home.\" The episode is now streaming on Paramount+.",
      "It was a hot summer day in August 1987 when Selonia's body was found inside her blue Chevy Sprint in a parking area about one-and-a-half miles from the Reed home. Police said she had been bludgeoned, stabbed multiple times and stripped naked. It was clear, police said, that she was sexually assaulted.",
      "Selonia's husband Reginald Reed Sr. had reported her missing an hour or so before her body was found. Reginald told police on the morning of Aug. 23, 1987, that Selonia told him she was going out with a girlfriend the night before. That girlfriend later told police the two had \"no plans\" to go out that night, but Reginald stuck to his story.",
      "As the investigation unfolded, police learned that Selonia had told relatives that Reginald was physically abusive and had talked about getting a divorce. He became an early suspect, but none of that suspicion reached the ears of Reggie, who was only a child.",
      "Reggie was questioned by police after they received permission from his father. The police videotaped Reggie's interview with a police detective while his father sat next to him. He vouched for his father's version of events, saying the two of them spent the evening playing video games and sleeping in the same sofa bed. In effect, Reggie became his father's alibi. Years later, Reggie viewed that interview and became emotional when he saw his 6-year-old self crying that he wanted his \"mommy\" and \"daddy.\"",
      "\"I just can't imagine what it's like as a 6-year-old to have to sit there,\" said Duthiers.",
      "\"Looking at that, it's still hard to believe that that's me,\" said Reggie. \"Watching that video just brings back so \u2026 so many questions and \u2014 and pain because \u2026 I see me crying.\"",
      "Reggie wrote a memoir about his experiences titled, \"The Day My Mother Never Came Home.\"",
      "Reggie had no idea that his father was the prime suspect in the case until 25 years later in 2012 when a Texas Ranger showed up at his home. By then, Reggie was 31, had graduated college and was working for a pharmaceutical company near San Antonio.",
      "\"I was like, where's this coming from?\" Reggie told \"48 Hours.\" \"I remember asking, is there any new evidence that was surfaced?\"",
      "But over the next few years, the new lead investigator in the case, Lt. Barry Ward of the Louisiana State Police, was able to come up with new evidence. Eventually, it was enough that Reginald and an alleged accomplice were indicted for second-degree murder.",
      "The accomplice, a friend of Reginald named Jimmy Ray Barnes, agreed to testify against Reginald in exchange for a five-year prison sentence. In November 2022, Reginald Reed Sr. was found guilty of second-degree murder for killing Selonia Reed and was later sentenced to life in prison.",
      "Ward told Reggie that police believe Reginald likely murdered Selonia in their bedroom while Reggie slept. Detectives believe he then placed her body in her car and drove to the spot where it was found. Reginald's co-conspirator Jimmy Ray Barnes testified at trial that he met Reginald at the crime scene and saw Reginald in that car next to Selonia's body.",
      "To this day, Reggie continues to question his father's guilt.",
      "\"I want justice, but I didn't think justice was gonna come at the price of my dad going to prison for life,\" Reggie told Duthiers who asked: \"Do you believe that your father murdered your mother?\"",
      "\"I don't know \u2026 another question \u2014 do I think my dad had some involvement?\u202fMaybe. I don't know though. I don't know. So that's where I'm just, it's like a tug-of-war game.\"",
      "Reggie said he struggles to square what the state claims with the father he knew. Reggie appreciates that his father was loving to him, put him through private school and raised him to be the man he is today.",
      "\"Just knowing the type of father he is,\" Reggie said. \"I can't just turn a page and just look at my father as a complete monster.\"",

      "At 1:31 a.m., Waterman's phone was again contacted by the same burner phone as the day before. Security video showed Waterman leaving a Holiday Inn Express in Hauppauge, Long Island, around the same time. This was the last time she was seen alive.",
      "\"I can't bring her back\"",
      "Liliana Waterman was just 3 years old when her mother disappeared. In her first television interview in 2020, Liliana (pictured with Megan Waterman) told \"48 Hours\" that if she could talk to her mom, she would tell her how much she loves her. \"I never got to really say those words,\" Liliana told correspondent Erin Moriarty. She said she misses her mom every day.",

      "Amber Costello, a 27-year-old escort living on Long Island, was contacted by someone using a burner phone. The next day, she left her house to meet a client and never returned.",
      "After Costello's disappearance, police say her roommate Dave Schaller told them about her clients. He described one of them as looking like an \"ogre\" and having \"a first-generation Chevrolet Avalanche.\" On the night she went missing, Schaller says, a client offered Cistello $1,500 for the night \u2013 six times her hourly rate.",
      "In 2011, Schaller spoke to Moriarty. \"This guy was so relentless,\" Schaller said. \"He called several times. He was on the phone with her for quite a while each time.\" He says the client got Costello, an experienced escort, to do something she never did: leave home without her purse or cellphone and meet him in his car. At nearly midnight, Schaller says Costello left the house, walked down the street, and he never saw her again.",

      "In December 2011, a year-and-a-half after she went missing, and a year after the Gilgo Four were found, investigators found\u00a0 Gilbert's remains. But they don't believe she was murdered.",
      "Years later, the Suffolk County Police Department released the full audio of Shannan's 21-minute 911 call on May 1, 2010, the morning she disappeared. Police Commissioner Rodney Harrison said in an interview with Erin Moriarty, Gilberts's death was likely not a murder. \"It's an unfortunate incident, but right now we believe that she just ran into the marsh and unfortunately drowned,\" Harrison said.",
      "February 2022: A fresh look at the case",
      "For nearly a decade after the discovery of the Gilgo Four, the investigation stalled. Until, in February 2022, a new task force was formed by Suffolk County Police Commissioner Rodney Harrison and Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney. In an interview withMoriarty, DA Tierney said, \"... a mere six weeks later ... Rex Heuermann was identified for the first time.\"",
      "A tip from the past",
      "How did investigators get a suspect in six weeks? It turns out that in the original case files were a number of critical clues that the new task force was finally able to connect. Costello's roommate Dave Schaller had previously described one of Costello's clients and the type of vehicle he drove to investigators. The vehicle was a first-generation Chevrolet Avalanche.",
      "With a description of an\"ogre-like\" man, and the make and model of his truck, police took a closer look at Costello's phone records from 2010. Schaller had told them that before Costello disappeared, there was one client that called her incessantly.",
      "The burner phone clue",
      "Police back then knew the client was using a burner phone. And they knew that the Brainard-Barnes, Barthelemy, Costello and Waterman \u00a0had all been in contact with burner numbers right before they disappeared.",
      "In 2012, with the help of the FBI, police determined that most of those calls connected to cell towers inside a small area of Massapequa Park, Long Island. They called this area \"the box.\" According to DA Tierney, \"the box\" consisted of a couple of blocks within Massapequa Park.",
      "A suspect in sight",
      "Armed with their small radius of \"the box\" and the description of an \"ogre-like\" man that drove a Chevrolet Avalanche, the task force now had a prime suspect. Police identified an architect named Rex Heuermann as the man they believed may have been responsible for the murders.",
      "And when they looked at Heuermann's personal cellphone records, they say that his phone was in the same area as those burner phones when they were used to contact victims. They also say that when the burner phones contacted victims, they were often in Massapequa Park, where Heuermann lived, or midtown Manhattan, where his architectural firm was located. In 2023, they noticed Heuermann going into a phone store to make a payment on a burner phone.",
      "A DNA hit",
      "Police began to tail Heuermann. When he threw out a pizza box into a trash can in midtown Manhattan, investigators found that Heuermann's DNA on the pizza crust was consistent with a DNA profile found on a male hair discovered with Megan Waterman's body. With DNA evidence, along with the cellphone records linking Heuermann to the burner phones, officers made an arrest.",
      "July 14, 2023: A suspect in custody",
      "Rex Heuermann, of Massapequa Park, Long Island,\u00a0 was\u00a0charged with multiple counts of murder\u00a0in the deaths of Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman and Amber Costello. Heuermann is currently the prime suspect for the murder of Maureen Brainard-Barnes, but he has not been charged with her death.",
      "When asked about Heuermann's innocence at a press conference, Heuerman's attorney Michael Brown said, \"What has my client told me? He told me he didn't do this.\"",
      "Digging for evidence",
      "Police spent 12 days looking through Heuermann's house, pulling guns out of the basement, and digging in the backyard. Another important piece of evidence taken into possession was a first-generation Chevrolet Avalanche registered to Heuermann at the time of the murders. It was sitting on property he owns in South Carolina when they recovered it.",
      "An opportunity to kill?",
      "A married man, Heuermann has a daughter and stepson with his second wife, Asa Ellerup. Ellerup, who was born in Iceland, would take the children to see her family there in the summers. It was during these trips and others, police believe, that Heuermann killed the women.",
      "Heuermann pleaded not guilty",
      "Heuermann was arraigned in Suffolk County Court in Riverhead, New York. He pleaded not guilty to the murders of Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman and Amber Costello. The judge ordered that he be held without bail in a Suffolk County jail where he is currently awaiting trial.",
      "Remembering Amber, Melissa and Megan",
      "Investigators hope that the arrest can give victims' families a sense of peace. Police Commissioner Harrison told Erin Moriarty, \"He took away somebody's mother, somebody's daughter, somebody's sister, not just one person, multiple individuals.\"",
      "Other investigations?",
      "Investigations spread to South Carolina and Las Vegas where Heuermann owns property, with detectives there taking a fresh look at cases of missing women. Heuermann has not been charged in any additional investigations.",
      "As for the other bodies found near Gilgo Beach \u2013 Jessica Taylor, Valerie Mack, Karen Vergata, \"Peaches\", the toddler girl, and the Asian male \u2013 none of them have been linked to Heuermann.",
      "Prosecutors: Suspect's cheek swab matches pizza box DNA",
      "DNA from Heuermann's cheek swab matches the DNA that authorities had previously collected from a pizza crust and used to link Heuermann to one of the victims, according to prosecutors during a Sept. 27, 2023 court appearance. Heuermann's lawyer disputed the significance of the DNA sample.",
      "Jan. 16, 2024: Heuermann charged with fourth killing",
      "Six months after his arrest, Rex Heuermann was indicted in the death of a fourth alleged victim, Maureen Brainard-Barnes. Investigators said they linked Brainard-Barnes' murder to Heuermann via DNA from a female hair found in the buckle of a belt used to bind her ankles, feet and legs - eight trillion to one that it matched Heuermann's wife Asa Ellerup or daughter Victoria, who was tailed on a commuter train and threw out an energy drink, according to court documents. Prosecutors made it clear they believed all hair transfer were made from Heuermann to his alleged victims. The family was out of town for the murders of the Gilgo Beach Four. Heuermann has pleaded not guilty to the murders.",
      "June 6, 2024: Two more cases linked to Heuermann",
      "Heuermann was charged with\u00a0killing two more women 10 years apart on Long Island \u2014 the 1993 murder of Sandra Costilla and the 2003 murder of Jessica Taylor. Costilla's death was not previously tied to the Gilgo case. The Suffolk County\u00a0district attorney's office says\u00a0DNA from hair found near Costilla and Taylor's remains and pick-up truck evidence connect Heuermann to their killings. Heuermann has pleaded not guilty to all charges.",
      "Dec. 17, 2024: Heuermann charged with 7th killing",

For years, she was known only as \"Jane Doe #6.\" Her partial remains were found in Manorville, Long Island, in 2000, and more of her remains were found on Gilgo Beach more than 10 years later.",

      "CONNECTING THE CLUES",
      "For more than a decade after the discovery of the Gilgo Four, Rex Heuermann's name never appeared on a suspect list until a new task force was formed with Suffolk County police commissioner Rodney Harrison and Suffolk County D.A. Ray Tierney.",
      "Ray Tierney: In February of 2022 we formed the task force \u2026 and then a mere six weeks later \u2026 Rex Heuermann was identified for the first time.",
      "A suspect in six weeks? So how did they do it? It turns out that buried in the original case files were a number of critical clues that the new task force was finally able to connect. Remember Amber's roommate Dave Schaller?",
      "Dave Schaller:\u00a0 She's like, \"I love you.\"\u00a0 You know, she gave me a hug. \u2026 And she left.",
      "He had told police about one of Amber's clients and his vehicle.",
      "Ray Tierney: Just a large, built man \u2026 and that, he was driving this, this first-generation Chevy Avalanche.",
      "A first-generation Chevy Avalanche. With a description of an ogre-like man, and the make and model of his truck, police took a closer look at Amber's phone records from 2010. Schaller had told them that before Amber disappeared, there was one particular client calling incessantly.",
      "Dave\u00a0Schaller: He called several times. He was on the phone with her for quite a while each time.",
      "Police back then knew the client was using a burner phone. That's a prepaid phone that anyone can buy and use anonymously. And they knew that Maureen, Melissa and Megan had all been in contact with burner numbers right before they disappeared.",
      "In 2012, with the help of the FBI, they determined that most of those calls connected to cell towers inside a small area of Massapequa Park. They called it \"the box.\"",
      "Erin Moriarty: So how large an area is that box?",
      "Ray Tierney: It's, you know, a couple of blocks within \u2014 within Massapequa Park.",
      "The new task force began the search for a large-built man who also lived in that small area and owned a Chevy Avalanche at the time of the disappearances.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Was there a \"aha!\" moment when, all of a sudden, his name came up?",
      "Rodney Harrison: Once we were able to attach the \u2026 Avalanche inside of that Massapequa box, which then attached to Rex Heuermann, that was a moment where we said, OK, there's something here.",
      "The task force now had a prime suspect. And when they looked at Heuermann's personal cellphone records, they found that his phone was in the same area as those burner phones when they were used to contact a victim in Massapequa Park or in midtown Manhattan.",
      "RAY TIERNEY (at news conference): it was always consistent.",
      "Tierney says this was also true for those awful calls Melissa's family got from that man using her phone back in 2009.",
      "Steve Cohen: He said, \"Do you know what I did to your sister?\" \u2026 and he said \u2026 \u00a0\"Well, I killed Melissa.\"",
      "The task force says that it confirmed that Heuermann does in fact use burner phones. Investigators say he had two different burner numbers in 2022, and they say they watched him put money on one of those accounts at a cellphone store in Midtown Manhattan.",
      "And according to court papers, the team also documented three email accounts using fake names, including John Springfield, Thomas Hawk and Hunter1903a3, and all linked to those burner numbers. And prosecutors say that Heuermann was using a burner phone to send these selfies to \"solicit and arrange for sexual activity.\"",
      "One of those accounts linked to Heuermann, prosecutors wrote, was used to conduct \"thousands of searches related to sex workers, sadistic, torture-related pornography and child pornography.\"",
      "RAY TIERNEY (at news conference): There was a lot of torture, porn, and \u2026 depictions of women, being abused, being raped, and being killed.",
      "Investigators also say that while they were busy watching Heuermann, Heuermann was trying to watch them \u2014 conducting searches on the task force and the Gilgo victims.",
      "RAY TIERNEY (at news conference): Not only pictures of the victims, pictures of their relatives \u2026 their sisters, their children, and he was trying to locate those individuals.",
      "The circumstantial evidence was building, but investigators also had physical evidence from the Gilgo Four\u2014including one male hair that was found in the burlap used to \"restrain and transport\" Megan Waterman's body. They wanted to see if they could link it to Heuermann.",
      "Police tailed Heuermann, and when he threw out a pizza box in a trash can in midtown Manhattan \u2014 they pounced.",
      "Ray Tierney: The pizza, which was \u2026 obviously very significant.",
      "Tierney says that Heuermann's DNA that was found on that pizza crust was consistent with a DNA profile from the hair found with Megan Waterman's body, and that DNA profile is only found in .04 percent of the population.",
      "Ray Tierney: That was a remarkable day. It was, you know, the weekend and, you know, you read, you get the report and you read it and then you read it again, and then you read it a third time and then you read it a fourth time, and then you start making calls.",
      "With the DNA, the search histories and the burner phone evidence, the team felt it was time.",
      "Ray Tierney: When we decided to take down the case, we, you know, it was a sudden decision. \u2026 We did see him contacting a number \u2014 of sex workers \u2026 using a burner phone, which obviously is concerning.",
      "Plainclothes officers arrested him around the corner from his office.",
      "Rodney Harrison: I don't think he had any clue. I don't think he had any clue that we were onto him.",
      "Police spent 12 days looking through Heuermann's home, pulling those guns out of the basement, and digging in the backyard. They say it will take some time to comb through what they have now, and they were tight lipped about what they found.",
      "REPORTER 1 (at news conference): Has the search been fruitful?",
      "RODNEY HARRISON: Great question and the answer's yes.",
      "REPORTER 2: \u2026 Can you elaborate on fruitful? You said yes, it's fruitful.",
      "RODNEY HARRISON: There have been items that we have taken into our possession, that makes it fruitful.",
      "And one more big piece of evidence taken into possession: a first-generation Chevy Avalanche Heuermann once used. It was sitting on property he owns in South Carolina when they recovered it.",
      "RAY TIERNEY (at news conference): We were able to seize that Chevy Avalanche pursuant to a search warrant. And we're certainly going to analyze that.",
      "But there were female hairs found on some of the victim's bodies that don't belong to the victims. So, who do they belong to?",
      "THE FAMILY OF A SUSPECTED SERIAL KILLER",
      "After Rex Heuermann's arrest, his quiet neighborhood in Massapequa Park was overrun by investigators and media, focusing intense scrutiny on the ramshackle home and its remaining residents: his stepson, Christopher Sheridan; daughter, Victoria Heuermann, and his wife more than 25 years, Asa Ellerup.",
      "Bob Macedonio: So, their life going forward is always gonna be the wife or the children of (a) suspected serial killer. That's what it's gonna be from now on.",
      "Attorney Bob Macedonio represents Ellerup, who has since filed for divorce from Heuermann. He says she was as stunned as anyone by the accusations.",
      "Bob Macedonio: She had no idea any of this was going on \u2026 The allegations are shocking. Nobody wants to think that they've been living with, sleeping next to a serial killer for the past 25 years.",
      "As it turns out, Ellerup may have inadvertently helped focus the investigation on her husband. Investigators say they've identified strands of female hair that were found on two of the victims.",
      "D.A. Ray Tierney | Suffolk County: One hair on Waterman \u2026 comes back to his wife, or the DNA profiles are consistent. And then \u2026 the DNA profile from Costello is consistent with \u2026 the wife.",
      "Although prosecutors have evidence that Ellerup was out of town when those murders occurred, they will have to explain how those hairs got on the victims. Suffolk County D.A. Ray Tierney says it could be as simple as transfer.",
      "Ray Tierney: You live at home with a spouse a little bit of your hair falls on your shoulder, as well as your spouse's. Then you go out and you interact with the third party and that hair gets on them.",
      "Ellerup has not been charged or named a suspect in any of the murders.",
      "Erin Moriarty: You don't believe that Rex Heuermann's wife was involved in this in any way?",
      "Ray Tierney: There's no evidence to indicate that. No.",
      "Along with the public scrutiny of Ellerup, there has also been support from people that perhaps know all too well what she's going through. Kerri Rawson, the daughter of serial killer Dennis Rader, who named himself BTK, tweeted: \"Asa and her kids are also victims.\"",
      "MELISSA MOORE (at news conference): I can tell that they are going through hell.",
      "And from Melissa Moore, the daughter of Keith Jesperson \u2014 a serial killer known as the \"Happy Face Killer\" for taunting authorities with letters signed with a happy face.",
      "BOB MACEDONIO (at news conference): She reached out immediately to myself and we put her in contact with Asa.",
      "At a news conference, Macedonio announced Moore set up a GoFundMe page for Ellerup, which raised over $50,000. It is money he says will largely go to medical bills \u2014 Asa is battling breast and skin cancer. And because Rex Heuermann was the sole provider for the family, Macedonio says she will soon lose her health insurance.",
      "BOB MACEDONIO (at news conference): Asa would like me to express her thanks for the support she has received. Um, she is going through a very difficult time.",
      "Ellerup's children have also paid a heavy price. Her daughter, Victoria, who worked for her father at the architectural consulting firm, and her son, Christopher, are both now unemployed. Ellerup struggles to support them, says Macedonio, while she's also trying to figure out how to start over.",
      "Erin Moriarty: How is she getting through every day?",
      "Bob Macedonio: Honestly?",
      "Erin Moriarty: Yeah.",
      "Bob Macedonio: Minute by minute. \u2026 She has no one else to turn into at this time. \u2026 Family and friends have been hesitant to have her come over because they don't want the media attention. She gets followed wherever she goes.",
      "For the moment, she and her children continue to live in the house in Massapequa Park, which the family says was excessively damaged during the police search. It's a daily reminder of the unimaginable crimes her estranged husband is charged with and the investigation that continues into what else he may have done.",
      "THE ONE WHO GOT AWAY?",
      "Rex Heuermann, awaiting trial, is locked inside a Suffolk County jail in a 60-square-foot cell. He denies killing Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman, and Amber Costello \u2014 their voices now silent as the sand where they had been ruthlessly discarded.",
      "Erin Moriarty: How sure are you as you're sitting here now that Rex Heuermann is the Long Island serial killer?",
      "Ray Tierney: So, we're just at the beginning stage of this case \u2026 but we would not have brought this indictment if we weren't confident in our case.",
      "Rodney Harrison: He took away somebody's mother, somebody's daughter, somebody's sister \u2014 not just one person, multiple individuals.",
      "Heuermann is currently the prime suspect for the murder of Maureen Brainard-Barnes.",
      "And for investigators, an obvious question still hangs heavy: if Heuermann is a killer, are there other victims?",
      "Erin Moriarty: I mean, isn't there a real concern that there may be other victims out there?",
      "Ray Tierney: Always.",
      "Rodney Harrison: Who's to say there's not more bodies out there that we need to investigate?",
      "In 2011, police did find other bodies along Ocean Parkway after finding the Gilgo Four.",
      "There is victim number 5, Jessica Taylor \u2013 an escort who went missing in 2003.",

      "And then there is Nikkie Brass.",
      "Nikkie Brass: I remembered him because one, he's massive. And how many massive, like 6-foot, 5 architects work in Manhattan and live in Massapequa?",
      "Now a hairdresser, Brass claims she may be one that got away. She told us she used to work as an escort. And while \"48 Hours\" cannot substantiate her story, Brass claims she can't shake her memory of the night she says she was solicited for sex by Rex Heuermann, and says she fled the restaurant where they met.",
      "Nikkie Brass: I had never gone anywhere and like felt, fear. My gut was telling me I needed to get away and I never had that before.",
      "Brass says what she found most disturbing is that Heuermann himself brought up those bodies bound in burlap by Gilgo Beach.",
      "Nikkie Brass: He wanted to, like, really get into it. Like, he asked me how I thought they could get rid of the bodies without being caught in that area. And I said, like, I've never been over there. \u2026 I've never even seen Gilgo Beach. \u2026 And his response was, well, it's really dark and desolate.",

      "More women coming forward claiming connections with Gilgo Beach murders suspect, sheriff says",
      "Brass is now represented by John Ray, an attorney who is also representing Shannan Gilbert's family. In December 2011, investigators finally found Shannan in the marsh not far from Gilgo Beach. But they don't believe she was murdered.",
      "Rodney Harrison: It's an unfortunate incident, but right now we believe that she just ran into the marsh and unfortunately drowned.",
      "A former investigator told us that he believes Shannan was high on drugs that night and says her death was an accident \u2014 something John Ray just can't believe. While he doesn't think Shannan was a victim of Heuermann, he does believe she was murdered and points to that 911 call.",
      "John Ray (December 2013): It makes absolutely no sense that she's found where she is, except that someone else put her there, or killed her there.",
      "While questions remain about Shannan's last hours, there's no question she's the reason so many families may finally be getting answers they have long waited for. \"48 Hours\" spoke to her sister, Sherre Gilbert, in 2011.",
      "Sherre Gilbert: Yeah, if my sister, you know, didn't make that 911 call \u2026 I don't think that these other women would have been recovered yet",
      "Now investigators hope that with an arrest they can give the victim's families, who stood with them, a sense of justice and of peace.",
      "Ray Tierney: I've gotten to know the families and I'm inspired by them, and I'm impressed by their patience.",

      "In the aftermath of Selonia's murder, her family came forward with more information -- some of it directed at one of Reginald's friends, Jimmy Ray Barnes. Turns out Barnes smoked Winston cigarettes -- the same brand found in Selonia's car. And Selonia's sister Gwen Smith said that Selonia did not like Jimmy Ray.",
      "Gwen Smith: And apparently she knew Jimmy Ray's voice 'cause she started screaming \u2026 \"come inside. I don't trust him.\" So she was scared of him \u2026",

      "Ward would learn that Barnes, along with Reginald, came under even more scrutiny two days after the murder. A witness came forward to say she had seen two men around John's Curb Market on the night Selonia was murdered.",
      "Lt. Barry Ward: She became suspicious and \u2026 later wrote down on a piece of scrap paper, the license plate. \u2026 As it turns out \u2026 that was the vehicle that Reginald Reed was known to, um, operate in. That was his car.",
      "Some two weeks later, police assembled a photo array and showed it to the witness.",
      "Lt. Barry Ward: The witness identified the driver as Reginald Reed and the passenger as Jimmy Ray Barnes.",
      "Barnes was given a polygraph test and police at the time said he passed. But it wasn't long before Jimmy Ray left Hammond.",
      "Reginald denied having anything to do with Selonia's murder. But neighbors told police the marriage was troubled. Family members say Selonia had accused her husband of physical abuse and there was talk of divorce. The police continued investigating but prosecutors never brought the case to a grand jury.",

      "Gwen Smith: I started feeling like nothing was gonna be done about her murder, and we would not get justice.",
      "Time passed, and Reginald continued to live in Hammond. He even ran for mayor in 1998.",

      "As far as Ward could determine, the crucifix and screwdriver found within days of the murder led nowhere. But the detective was drawn to several life insurance policies Reginald had taken out on Selonia that paid out more than $700,000. Some of those policies were taken out the same month that Selonia was murdered.",
      "Ward wanted to reinterview Reggie Jr. in 2012. Reggie was 31 years old and living in Texas. Ward sent a Texas Ranger to begin the questioning.",
      "Reggie Reed: \u2026 he told me why he was here, and it was to \u2026 discuss \u2026 my mother's murder.",

      "It's true that the insurance policies had been discovered by the original detectives, but Ward had organized them in a way that he felt was damning. The Texas Ranger asked Reggie about those policies.",
      "Reggie Reed: He showed me a graph, a timeline \u2026 it showed each insurance policy that were taken out close to her death.",
      "Vladimir Duthiers: Did you all of a sudden say, I need to get to the bottom of this or what?",
      "Reggie Reed: It was eye-opening \u2026 cause I'm like, well, that doesn't look good \u2026 I got to learn what, like what's all this?",
      "Reggie struggled to make sense of it all.",
      "Reggie Reed: I did talk to my dad about it over the phone, and his response was \u2026 he -- he took out policies on everyone.",
      "Reggie said he finds it hard to square what the investigation revealed with the loving father who raised him.",
      "Reggie Reed: I look back, I'm like, man, he really -- he really did do some great stuff for me. He was a great provider.",
      "Ward took a deep dive into the case file and focused on that Winston cigarette butt found in Selonia's car. He sent it out for DNA testing, something that was not widely available in 1987. There was a match in the national crime DNA database CODIS, but not to Jimmy Ray.",
      "Barry Ward: It came back to \u2026 a man by the name of Billy Ray Barnes.",

      "Ward found Jimmy Ray Barnes in the Atlanta area where he said Jimmy Ray told him he'd fled Hammond because he was afraid of Reginald Reed. Jimmy Ray Barnes said back then, he'd been shot at three times and hit once in the neck. He suspected the shooter was Reginald Sr. but had no proof.",
      "Lt. Barry Ward: Jimmy said he was known to carry a gun. But you fast forward \u2026 25, now 30 years \u2026 Reginald Reed was now an old man.",

      "JIMMY RAY BARNES: Yeah.",
      "BARRY WARD: \u2026 is that a guess or is that the amount he offered?",
      "JIMMY RAY BARNES: That was the amount he offered.",

      "JIMMY RAY BARNES: \u2026 I don't trust the law no more.",
      "Ward confronted Barnes about that polygraph test from the original case file. Barnes allegedly had passed that polygraph, but Ward suspected Jimmy Ray secretly had asked his identical twin Billy Ray to take that test.",
      "LT. BARRY WARD: I talked to Billy \u2026 and he said he took that polygraph test \u2026 And if Billy looked like you and was questioned over a murder that you took part in and he doesn't know anything about it, he's probably going to pass that polygraph test. Would that be fair to say?",
      "JIMMY RAY BARNES: I don't know. I'm not going to answer that cause I -- I know I'm the one who took the polygraph test.",
      "Ward believed he had a solid case to finally bring charges. He had Jimmy Ray's DNA connected to the crime scene and his videotaped statement about Reginald offering him $50,000 to kill Selonia. But, Ward said, prosecutors always wanted more.",
      "Lt. Barry Ward: I would get phone calls through the years from \u2026 prosecutors \u2026 who had asked me to reinterview family members \u2026 find out additional information, test more evidence \u2026 it was busy work.",
      "Then, in 2018, a newly hired prosecutor, Taylor Anthony, got assigned the case.",
      "Vladimir Duthiers: Why reopen a 35-year-old case? What was the trigger?",
      "Taylor Anthony: Well, why reopen it? It's an interesting question \u2026 this was a case to me right away when I looked at it \u2026 that there was a story to be told.",
      "Anthony was impressed by all the investigative work done by Ward, so he reached out, but Ward told Anthony he was too busy and that he felt he'd been let down by other prosecutors.",
      "Lt. Barry Ward: My initial response was to just get this guy off the phone.",
      "Taylor Anthony: He said, look, I've already poured hundreds of man hours into that case \u2026 and y'all, didn't do anything and \u2026 He said \u2026 You're wasting your time, kid \u2026 have a nice life, basically.",

      "Lt. Barry Ward: We pulled up early in the morning when the sun was coming up and he was coming out of this camper \u2026 putting a belt in his pants. \u2026 And he said, uh, hey, \"who y'all looking for?\" \u2026 I said, \"you, Jimmy.\" And he goes, \"Oh, you, again.\"",
      "But this time the new prosecutor had with him an agreement, approved by a judge, giving Barnes complete immunity if he testified to everything he knew about Selonia's murder.",

      "Anthony was quick to take him up on that challenge.",
      "Lt. Barry Ward: A couple of weeks later \u2026 a grand jury in Tangipahoa Parish returned second-degree murder indictments for both Reginald Reed and Jimmy Ray Barnes. \u2026 immediately \u2026 we went to Reginald's home \u2026 I knocked on the door, identified who I was and that I had an arrest warrant for him for the murder of his wife \u2026 He \u2026 really had no emotion.",

      "Reggie Reed: Yeah. I asked him -- I asked him. And he -- he -- he maintains his innocence.",
      "Sitting in another Hammond jail cell was Jimmy Ray Barnes. He now had a lawyer and asked to speak with Det. Barry Ward and Taylor Anthony.",
      "Taylor Anthony: So, Barry and I went and met with him again. \u2026 And in exchange for him telling us everything he knew \u2026 he was offered a deal to plead to accessory after the fact to murder and was given a five-year prison sentence.",

      "LaToia Williams-Simon: Their entire case is circumstantial.",
      "Williams-Simon says the state's case was weak: there was no murder weapon, no fingerprints or DNA tying Reed to Selonia's homicide.",
      "LaToia Williams-Simon: I was confused as to how they were really gonna prove their case. \u2026 There's no direct evidence.",
      "But prosecutor Taylor Anthony believed his prosecution would deliver justice to Selonia.",
      "Taylor Anthony: The reason I became a prosecutor is to fight for people like this \u2026 I see a woman \u2026 whose body has been desecrated, violated, mutilated, and nobody spoke up for her and fought for her. And there is a quote that I love, and it goes \u2026 \"The dead cannot cry out for justice. It is the duty of the living to do so for them.\" \u2026 And that's my job.",
      "Anthony told jurors about the $700,000 from the insurance policies on Selonia's life.",
      "Vladimir Duthiers: So, what was your theory once you put all these pieces together?",
      "Taylor Anthony: My theory was that \u2026 Selonia and Reginald were in a marriage that was about to come to an end \u2026 there was a history of abuse and that Selonia was tired of it and she was ready to leave Reginald. ... I think \u2026 he was angry and he saw an opportunity for some money. \u2026 I think that's why he killed this woman.",
      "Vladimir Duthiers: The case that they're presenting, which is this man takes out all these life insurance policies on a young, healthy 26-year-old woman \u2026 what is his rationale for having done that?",
      "Vanessa Williams: But they're missing the biggest part of it.",
      "Vladimir Duthiers: Which is?",
      "Vanessa Williams: It wasn't just on her. It was on himself. It was on the child. \u2026 It was family policies. So, it's not like he just went and took out policies on Selonia only.",
      "Prosecutor Anthony was frank with jurors, telling them that the state would not produce a murder weapon or the exact location where Selonia was stabbed. He focused on what the prosecution did have, including that white lotion found on Selonia's body.",
      "Taylor Anthony: \u2026 later police were able to find a bottle of lotion in the Reed household that matched that type of lotion that was on her body.",
      "The prosecutor also showed jurors a photograph of some scratches on Reginald Reed Sr.'s neck taken on the day Selonia's body was found.",
      "Taylor Anthony: They wanted to take photographs of his neck, and he was very hesitant \u2026",
      "Anthony said Reed told police two different stories about how he got those scratches but after forensic testing, it was determined that none of Reginald's DNA was found under Selonia's fingernails.",
      "LaToia Williams-Simon: They believe that the killer is Mr. Reginald Reed. So, anything that goes to contradict that they're gonna completely block out.",
      "Williams-Simon pointed to Jimmy Ray Barnes' long criminal record of arrests.",
      "LaToia Williams-Simon: It couldn't be introduced at trial.",
      "Vladimir Duthiers: Because?",
      "LaToia Williams-Simon: And the reason why his criminal rap sheet couldn't be introduced at trial is because these aren't convictions \u2026",
      "But Williams-Simon says Jimmy Ray's arrests were for violent crimes.",
      "LaToia Williams-Simon: False imprisonment and aggravated assault, aggravated battery with a dangerous weapon, murder \u2026 These are things that the jury had a right to know, but because of the law, they didn't find out.",
      "Jimmy Ray Barnes ultimately took the stand as part of his plea agreement. There were no cameras in the courtroom. In a recording taken from Barnes' police interview conducted by Ward before the trial, he told the same story as when he testified:",
      "On the night of the murder, Barnes said he promised to meet Reginald Reed Sr. in the parking area outside John's Curb Market where Selonia's body had been found.",
      "JIMMY RAY BARNES (recorded interview): When I got there, he was getting out of the little blue car. The little blue car was parked there.",

      "JIMMY RAY BARNES (recorded interview): I did see the body in there. And uh, I panicked ...",
      "Taylor Anthony: My understanding after the fact is that Jimmy Ray Barnes talked to Reggie [Sr.] and said, \"where is the money? You told me $50,000.\" \u2026 he says he never got a penny of it.",
      "Prosecutor Anthony contends that, after the men drove away, Reginald Reed Sr. returned and \"staged\" the crime scene, stripping off Selonia's clothes, covering her with that white lotion, and leaving other evidence to make it appear as a sex crime.",
      "Vladimir Duthiers: And what does your dad say to that?",
      "Reggie Reed: He says it's completely BS. He says \u2026 it's no way. We were at home playing Nintendo.",
      "Williams-Simon had her own theory of what happened that night.",
      "LaToia Williams-Simon: All of the information that we've received about Jimmy Ray Barnes is that \u2026 he was borderline obsessed with Selonia \u2026 I believe that maybe he encountered her, tried to make a pass at her that was \u2026 rejected, and that's where you see that anger, that rage, that hatred.",
      "Sitting through the trial, Reggie admitted that the relentless focus on his mother's murder was upsetting, especially as he watched that crime scene video which he had never seen before.",

      "The firing squad is an execution method with a long and violent history around the world. It has been used to punish mutinies and desertion in armies, as frontier justice in America's Old West and as a tool of terror and political repression in the former Soviet Union and Nazi Germany.",

      "Mahdi's is the 12th execution in the U.S. this year. Twenty-five prisoners in nine states were killed in all of 2024. Alabama and Louisiana have killed inmates by nitrogen gas. Florida, Oklahoma, Arizona and Texas have executed men by lethal injection, while South Carolina has used both the firing squad and lethal injection.",
      "Mahdi admitted he killed Orangeburg Public Safety officer James Myers in 2004, shooting him at least eight times before burning his body. Myers' wife found him in the couple's Calhoun County shed, which had been the backdrop to their wedding 15 months earlier.",
      "Myers' shed was a short distance through the woods from a gas station where Mahdi tried but failed to buy gas with a stolen credit card and left behind a vehicle he had carjacked in Columbia. Mahdi was arrested in Florida while driving Myers' unmarked police pickup truck.",
      "Mahdi also admitted to the killing three days earlier of Christopher Boggs, a Winston-Salem, North Carolina, convenience store clerk who was shot twice in the head as he checked Mahdi's ID. Mahdi was sentenced to life in prison for that killing.",
      "Mahdi's final appeal was rejected this week by both the U.S. and South Carolina Supreme Courts. His lawyers said Mahdi's original attorneys put on a shallow case trying to spare his life that didn't call on relatives, teachers or others who knew him and ignored the impact of months spent in solitary confinement in prison as a teen.",
      "The defense's case to spare Mahdi's life before a judge lasted only about 30 minutes. It \"didn't even span the length of a Law & Order episode, and was just as superficial,\" Mahdi's lawyers wrote.",
      "Mahdi's earliest memory was his father slamming his mother through a glass table and later lying to his son and saying his mother was dead. Mahdi's father pulled him out of school in fifth grade when officials suggested he needed behavioral help, defense lawyers said.",
      "Prosecutors said Mahdi constantly used brutality to solve his problems. As a death row prisoner, he stabbed a guard and hit another worker with a concrete block. Mahdi was caught three times with tools he could have used to escape, including a piece of sharpened metal that could be used as a knife, according to prison records.",
      "\"The nature of the man is violence,\" prosecutors wrote.",

      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis said in a written order that the administration \"made no meaningful effort to comply\" with her directive to file a declaration addressing three questions related to the confinement of\u00a0Kilmar Abrego Garcia\u00a0at a Salvadoran supermax prison: his current physical location and custodial status; what stems the administration has taken to facilitate his return to the U.S.; and what steps they will take and when to facilitate his release.",
      "\"From this court's perspective, defendants' contention that they could not answer these basic questions absent some nonspecific 'vetting' that has yet to take place, provides no basis for their lack of compliance,\" she wrote.",
      "Xinis directed the administration to file daily declarations providing information in response to her queries. Her written order came after a hearing Friday.\u00a0 The Justice Department had told her in a filing earlier in the day that it was unable to provide the information she requested about Abrego Garcia and called a Friday morning deadline she set to provide the details \"impracticable.\"",
      "Xinis had\u00a0ordered the Trump administration to give her information about Abrego Garcia after the Supreme Court on Thursday reaffirmed her directive for the federal government to \"facilitate\" his release from Salvadoran custody.",

      "The judge called the lack of evidence from the Justice Department about Abrego Garcia's whereabouts \"extremely troubling.\"",
      "\"It behooves this case and how the system of justice works that the following be communicated to your clients: You are the officer of the court. You are the instrument to represent\" the government, Xinis said. She said that the record in the case currently shows that despite her directive to take steps to bring Agrego Garcia back to the U.S., \"your clients have done nothing to facilitate\" his return.",
      "\"I'm not sure what to take from the fact that the Supreme Court has spoken quite clearly and yet I can't get an answer today about what you've done, if anything, in the past,\" Xinis said.",
      "Ensign told the judge that the federal government \"intends to comply with the Supreme Court's order.\" He said that while the administration is prepared to answer her questions about Abrego Garcia's whereabouts and what actions have been taken to secure his return, they may assert privileges.",
      "Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Abrego Garcia's lawyer, said his lawyers and family have not had contact with Abrego Garcia, and accused the Trump administration of \"playing games with their own lawyers.\"",
      "\"They clearly didn't comply\" with the district court's order to turn over information about Abrego Garcia, he said.",
      "In the\u00a0filing to the court ahead of the hearing, Justice Department attorneys told the judge they \"are not in a position where they 'can' share any information requested by the court. That is the reality.\"",
      "\"Defendants received the order late in the evening last night. They are reviewing the order and actively evaluating next steps,\" they wrote. \"It is unreasonable and impracticable for defendants to reveal potential steps before those steps are reviewed, agreed upon, and vetted. Foreign affairs cannot operate on judicial timelines, in part because it involves sensitive country-specific considerations wholly inappropriate for judicial review.\"",
      "The Justice Department lawyers said that the judge gave them an \"insufficient amount of time\" to review the Supreme Court's order and argued she has not yet provided clarity as to the scope of her initial directive, as the high court told her to do.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys opposed the government's request for more time to respond to the judge's directives and accused the Justice Department of continuing \"to delay, obfuscate, and flout court orders, while a man's life and safety is at risk.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia, who lives in Maryland with his wife and children, was arrested and removed to El Salvador last month after Trump administration officials accused him of having ties to the MS-13 gang.\u00a0 His lawyers said he has no affiliation with MS-13, and has never been charged or convicted of any criminal offenses in the U.S. or El Salvador.",

      "But Abrego Garica's case emerged as a flashpoint in President Trump's immigration crackdown after a U.S. immigration official acknowledged in a court filing that his removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error\" and \"oversight.\"",
      "In 2019, an immigration judge granted Abrego Garcia relief known as withholding of removal, which forbids the government from returning him to his home country of El Salvador because he is more likely than not to face persecution from local gangs, according to court records.",
      "While the Trump administration admitted the error in sending Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, it has argued that the district court has no jurisdiction over the Salvadoran government and therefore cannot force it to release Abrego Garcia from its prison. Justice Department lawyers have said that the Salvadoran government has custody of Abrego Garcia, so he cannot be returned to the U.S. unless it releases him.",
      "Abrego Garcia and his wife filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Maryland following his arrest and removal, alleging it violated federal immigration law. They sought an order requiring his return to U.S. custody.",
      "Xinis granted that request last week following a hearing and directed the government to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. no later than 11:59 p.m. Monday. The dispute ended up before the Supreme Court, and Chief Justice John Roberts put that deadline on hold to allow the high court more time to consider the matter.",
      "Then, on Thursday, the Supreme Court unanimously agreed that the Trump administration had to \"facilitate\" the release of Abrego Garcia from Salvadoran custody and \"ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador\" \u2014 to provide Abrego Garcia with due process of law.",
      "But the Supreme Court also directed the district court to clarify its order, and specifically the directive that the government \"effectuate\" Abrego Garcia's return.",
      "\"The district court should clarify its directive, with due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs,\" the court said. \"For its part, the government should be prepared to share what it can concerning the steps it has taken and the prospect of further steps.\"",

      "But after spending almost seven years behind bars waiting through legal delays and COVID, she is scheduled to go on trial for the murder of her husband, celebrity hairdresser and beauty executive Fabio Sementilli.",
      "As \"48 Hours\" contributor Michelle Miller reports, it's a tangled story. Her defenders say Monica Sementilli is an innocent victim. But if you believe prosecutors, she's a criminal. Authorities describe a case of lust, greed, and murder. Whichever it is, the drama unfolded on Jan. 23, 2017.",
      "Elyse Bleuel: There were fire trucks outside of her house\u2026and I was like, oh gosh \u2026 there was no police yet. It was just the first responders.",
      "Elyse Bleuel was a friend of Monica Simental's. \"48 Hours\" spoke with her in 2018. She says Monica texted her to come over the night Fabio was killed.",
      "Elyse Bleuel: it was her and her daughters \u2026 She just kept saying that \"he's gone, that I'm not a wife anymore\" \u2026 I just held her. I just held her.",
      "Elyse Bleuel: It was so painful, just the weeping\u2026the not being able to breathe\u2026she was beyond devastated\u2026 beyond devastated.",
      "Monica's husband, Fabio, was slumped over his chair by the pool.",
      "Michelle Miller: Had you seen the body? Had you seen?",
      "Elyse Bleuel: Didn't \u2026",
      "Elyse Bleuel: I just wanted to be the best possible comfort. \u2026 \u00a0I didn't know how to comfort that. \u2026 she couldn't speak in complete sentences until like the fourth day.",
      "Detectives quickly learned the victim, Fabio Sementilli, had been a superstar in the beauty business.",
      "\"48 Hours\" spoke with those who knew him best in 2017. Fabio's sister, Mirella Rota",
      "Mirella Rota: He was a happy man. And he wanted everybody around him happy.",
      "Luigi Sementilli: The best way to describe my dad, really, is like a cup of coffee in the morning.",
      "Luigi Sementilli is Fabio's son from an earlier marriage.",
      "Luigi Sementilli: He gets you going \u2026 he lifts your spirits \u2026 he gets you determined to charge the mountain of life.",
      "Michelle Miller: Did your friends say, \"Hey Luigi, is that your dad?\"",
      "Luigi Sementilli: Absolutely, yeah. It was kind of a fun thing, you know. \u2026 It's hard to avoid him when you type in Sementilli on Google, it's very hard \u2026 in fact when you type in my name, Luigi Sementilli, the first thing that comes up is his profile! (laughs)",
      "Fabio and his sister Mirella began cutting hair in Toronto, Canada.",
      "That's where Fabio met Monica, a customer and makeup artist he married in 1997.",
      "Joe Mercurio: The wedding was incredible.",
      "Restauranteur Joe Mercurio grew up with Fabio. He was best man at Fabio's wedding to Monica.",

      "FABIO SEMENTILLI (video): My own family unit is the most most dear to me.",
      "Then came that January day. It was late afternoon as he sat by the pool. Fabio was stabbed to death. His then-16-year-old daughter Isabella discovered his body.",
      "To investigators, the Sementilli case started out a mystery. But from early on, they had at least one intriguing clue.",
      "From a neighbor's security camera, they could see two figures in hoodies running close to the Sementilli's house at the time of the murder. A little while later, Fabio's Porsche was being driven away. Back then, Investigators didn't suspect Monica had anything to do with Fabio's death.\u00a0 She wasn't even home at the time he was killed. Instead, they looked at those two hooded figures.",
      "At the time of Fabio's murder in 2017, L.A was plagued with break-ins from notorious teams of criminals.",
      "Michelle Miller (watching video of a knock-knock burglary): What do you call these guys?",
      "Det. William Dunn: Well, we call them the knock-knock burglars.",
      "Michelle Miller: So, this is LAPD footage?",
      "Det. William Dunn: Yeah. They know what they're doing, and they know what they want.",
      "Michelle Miller:\u00a0 I mean... they're running wild!",
      "They were hitting homes of celebrities all over Los Angeles.",
      "CRIME SCENE EVIDENCE LEADS TO A SUSPECT",
      "It was 2017, and, for years, the homes of L.A. celebrities were targeted.",
      "LOCAL NEWS REPORT: At least seven celebrities had hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of jewelry taken.",
      "LOCAL NEWS REPORT: High-profile victims include $300,000 from former Lakers star Derek Fisher, $175,000 for Nikki Minaj\u2026and $2 million from Alanis Morrissette's Brentwood home.",
      "Det. William Dunn | LAPD (watching surveillance video of a knock-knock burglary): They're moving just as quick as they can.",
      "Det. William Dunn: In and out in about three minutes ... they ransack a bedroom, find some jewelry and get out.",
      "William Dunn, a Los Angeles Police Department detective at the time, had hours of videotape of the knock-knock burglars in action all over wealthy Los Angeles neighborhoods, including one from a home just a few miles from Fabio's, months after his murder.",
      "Michelle Miller (watching surveillance video of a knock-knock burglary): They seem to know what to look for.",
      "Det. William Dunn: Right, they're looking for jewelry. They're looking for cash.",
      "Michelle Miller: Look at him!",
      "Det. William Dunn: Yeah, see he's checking clothes, he's feelin the clothes to see if somebody's put jewelry or cash in some of the pockets.",
      "Det. William Dunn: See? Now he's seeing that safe.",
      "Michelle Miller: Ah!",
      "Det. William Dunn: See, and now he gets \u2013 he tells his buddy. Hey, look at what we've found. Now look at how many seconds, and this is a real heavy safe. \u2026 but they're very determined \u2026 they put a lot of effort into it and it's so heavy he can't \u2013 he can't lift the thing. But look at how he's just gonna slide that thing out.",
      "Michelle Miller: So they got the safe, that's pay dirt, and off they go.",
      "Det. William Dunn: They're gone. Yup! You see? They're gone.",
      "To detectives, those two hooded figures recorded on a neighbor's surveillance camera near Fabio's house right around the time of his murder looked a lot like the knock-knock burglars.",
      "And the Sementilli home had its own cameras. Detectives hoped they would find even more video of those hooded figures on those tapes.",
      "There were four cameras outside the Sementilli house, but when police came to look for the video, it was gone! A DVR was in the garage, it stored all the surveillance. Whoever broke in must have taken it.",
      "Strangely, besides taking Fabio's Porsche, that black box was one of the only things stolen from the house, say investigators. Monica told them she thought some inexpensive jewelry and $11,000 in cash was possibly missing, but she wasn't sure. Detectives say the home safe hadn't been touched.",
      "Luigi Sementilli: The only thing I thought that was unusual was why didn't they take more?\u00a0 Why didn't they take his watch?",
      "The suspected burglars left behind an $8,000 Rolex on Fabio's wrist.",
      "But within months, the knock-knock burglars began to fade as police suspects because the police were hanging on to a big secret. Nobody except investigators knew it at the time, but they discovered blood at the crime scene that did not belong to Fabio Sementilli. That meant detectives had DNA to work with. DNA that eventually led to a suspect.",
      "Capt. William Hayes | LAPD: We were able to develop forensic evidence \u2026 some of that was DNA, which identified Robert Baker.",
      "Robert Baker had been a racquetball league director at a Los Angeles gym, not far from Fabio's house. And Monica's friend, Elyse Bleuel, knew him. \"48 Hours\" spoke to her about him in 2018.",
      "Michelle Miller: How would you describe Rob Baker?",
      "Elyse Bleuel: He was cool. We all really liked him.",
      "Elyse Bleuel: He was one of those gym guys \u2014 you know, grrr!",
      "Bleuel played in his league.",
      "Elyse Bleuel: He was very alpha. He was a very alpha male. There was also kind of a sexual-ly thing about him.",
      "Michelle Miller: There was something sexual about him. What do you mean?",
      "Elyse Bleuel: You know how some guys just have just have this sexual kind of, I don't know, he was very manly \u2026 he was in shape, and he was kind of, you know, kept everything \u2014 he was in charge.",
      "He was also tangled up in the porn industry, even doing some acting.",
      "Bleuel didn't know much about Baker's background, but she did hear about his movie career from a friend who happened to spot him in an adult film.",
      "Elyse Bleuel: That's like the kind of gossip that \u2026 you just need to tell someone.",
      "Michelle Miller: Who did you tell?",
      "Elyse Bleuel: I told Monica.",
      "Monica was also in Robert Baker's racquetball league.",
      "Michelle Miller: What was her reaction?",
      "Elyse Bleuel: Well, it was pretty anticlimactic, I'll tell ya.",
      "Michelle Miller: Really?",
      "Elyse Bleuel: Yeah. 'cause a lotta times when we would have girl talk she'd get a little prude-y. \u00a0Like a little prude.",
      "What Bleuel didn't know was that Baker was also a registered sex offender.",
      "Capt. William Hayes: Robert Baker has a 1993 conviction out of a Long Beach case. It's for lewd and lascivious acts with a minor.",
      "Police say Baker served time for that offense against a teenage girl.",
      "For months, police watched Baker and they discovered two things. First, he was definitely not one of the knock-knock burglars, and second, he made thousands of calls and texts to of all people, Monica Sementilli.",
      "In fact, just days after Fabio's death, Monica held a wake in her backyard and Baker actually showed up.",
      "Michelle Miller: You did meet him?",
      "Mirella Rota: I did.",
      "Rota says she saw Monica hanging out with Baker.",
      "Mirella Rota: I saw her back \u2026 outside again, with a drink, smoking, and talking to this guy. \u2026 I found out that that was his name, Rob. And she introduced me to him.",
      "Luigi noticed him, too.",
      "Luigi Sementilli: Robert and Monica were in the corner talking to each other, sort of away from the party.",
      "And there was something else Luigi noticed about Baker.",
      "Luigi Sementilli: He had bandages on his hands.",
      "One guest even snapped pictures of Monica and Robert Baker together. If you look closely, you can just make out a bandage on Baker's finger. Police would later conclude Baker cut that finger when he killed Fabio. And that's how his blood was at the scene.",
      "Detectives visited Monica at home using what they called a \"ruse\" \u2014 telling her they were investigating the knock-knock burglars, when in fact they were investigating her and secretly following Monica and Baker. And according to authorities, it paid off. They say they found evidence that Monica and Baker were having an affair and conspired to kill Fabio.",
      "JUSTIN EISENBERG | LAPD Chief of Detectives [to reporters in June 2017]: Over the past several months, investigators have developed information and identified Robert Baker, 55 years old of Canoga Park and Monica Sementilli, 45 years old, of Woodland Hills, who is the wife of our homicide victim, as responsible for his murder.",
      "Mirella Rota: He said, \"We arrested Monica for the murder of your brother, and Robert Baker for the murder of your brother.\" And I was in shock. I'm like, \"They're \u2014 you sure?\" You know? I \u2014 I was in shock.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: According to the prosecution \u2026 these two were plotting and planning to kill Fabio so they could live their life together.",
      "Mary Fulginiti is a former federal prosecutor and a \"48 Hours\" consultant.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: It was a very complicated investigation.",
      "As authorities hustled Robert Baker and Monica Sementilli into court, they each pleaded \"not guilty.\" But almost six years later, Baker changed everything.",
      "Mary Fulginiti:\u00a0 When he came to court that day, people were stunned.",
      "ROBERT BAKER PLEADS NO CONTEST TO MURDER OF FABIO SEMENTILLI",
      "Monica Sementilli was being accused of cheating on Fabio with that racquetball coach Robert Baker and then\u2014along with Baker\u2014 planning Fabio's murder.",
      "Elyse Bleuel: My instant and thorough and complete reaction was there's no effing way \u2026 I was there. She was decimated.",
      "After months of crying and grieving alongside Monica, Fabio's family couldn't believe it either.",
      "Mirella Rota: Twenty-some years of my life she was like a sister. She was a cool aunt to my kids \u2026 she was loveable \u2026 my whole family felt that way about her (crying).",
      "Then, in 2023, Baker skipped trial altogether and pleaded no contest.",
      "Mary Fulginiti:\u00a0 Robert Baker pleads no contest.\u00a0 And that's in essence accepting responsibility for the murder. He's ultimately sentenced to life without parole.",
      "JUDGE RONALD COEN (in court): The maximum sentence in this case is life imprisonment without the possibility of parole plus one year. \u2026 You understand this?",
      "ROBERT BAKER: Yes, sir.",
      "But while Baker was accepting responsibility for Fabio's death, Monica wasn't.",
      "MIRELLA ROTA (in court) : What he and Monica did to my brother, Fabio, is unforgivable.",
      "But Monica's own daughters, Isabella and Gessica, supported their mom.",
      "GESSICA SEMENTILLI (in court): We will continue to stand by our mother as we have done for the last six years, and we will fight for her innocence.",
      "As Monica prepared to go to trial, her defense attorney Leonard Levine made a statement.",
      "LEONARD LEVINE: We are confident that Robert Baker's guilty pleas and his truthful testimony will finally establish once and for all that Monica Sementilli had nothing to do with the planning or the murder of Fabio Sementilli, her husband.",
      "Monica's defense team wasn't answering questions before trial, so \"48 Hours\" asked New York-based defense attorney Julie Rendelman to review Monica's defense team's pre-trial motions.",
      "Julie Rendelman: There's no witnesses that we know of so far that are going to come forward and testify that she planned this murder.",
      "She says Monica's relationship with Baker doesn't prove anything.",
      "Michelle Miller: It seems to strengthen the DA's case that not only did she have an affair, but the person she was having the affair with is the killer.",
      "Julie Rendelman: I hear you, but the problem is \u2014 is that simply because an individual is having an affair, the \u2014 you cannot take the leap to get to an individual being responsible, um, for the death of their loved one, certainly not beyond a reasonable doubt.",
      "But the prosecution says the affair is key to establishing a conspiracy between Monica and Robert Baker \u2014 an alleged conspiracy detectives spent months tracking.",
      "Michelle Miller: How long was that investigation?",
      "Mary Fulginiti: Five months. Five to six months.",
      "While the DA also declined an interview before going to trial, former prosecutor Mary Fulginiti reviewed the case against Monica.",
      "Michelle Miller (outside the Sementilli's home): So, this is the scene of the crime?",
      "Mary Fulginiti: Yeah \u2026 You know, this is where the two joggers, you know, came according to the video from a neighbor, uh, running up here toward the house.",
      "Prosecutors say that first hooded figure \u2014 in the green sweatshirt\u2014 is Robert Baker.",
      "Michelle Miller: So, what about that accomplice?",
      "Mary Fulginiti: We don't know who that person is. \u2026 it's a mystery.",
      "Michelle Miller: What does this indictment say about Monica Sementilli?",
      "Mary Fulginiti: This indictment is a very detailed outline and timeline of the plot to kill Fabio Sementilli.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: Motive here is simple. I mean, this is love and money. This is one of the oldest crimes in the book where, you know, two lovers desperately wanting to be together, and they try to get rid of one of the spouses so they can be together for what? For financial benefit. \u2026 And that would mean the three quarters of a million life insurance policy, the house, 401ks.",
      "Police say the plan was to stage the scene to make it look like the work of the knock-knock burglars and throw police off their trail. And they believe Monica was deeply involved.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: They believe \u2026 she was the one that coordinated everything, the one that showed him, you know, where the house was, where the DVR was, so that he knew where to go to rip it out of the walls. How to get into the house.",
      "And that's not all. The prosecutor says six months before the murder, Monica forwarded an email sharing details of her home security system with Baker.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: She provided the password, the username, the log in credentials, as well as the user manual to Robert Baker, the same day that she received it from the surveillance company.",
      "And then there's the day of the murder. Prosecutors say Monica's behavior that day is a key element of her role in the conspiracy to kill Fabio. According to prosecutors, surveillance video shows Monica left home at 3:26 p.m. driving the family's black Ford F-150 pickup.",
      "Michelle Miller (standing in a Target parking lot): This is where she came, according to prosecutors, to establish her alibi?",
      "Mary Fulginiti: So, a lot happens in this parking lot. \u2026 she pulls in here in her Ford-150 pickup truck right in front of this store \u2026 stops for just a few minutes.",
      "Prosecutors say they have video where it appears an individual gets into Monica's truck. They say that person was Robert Baker. Monica then goes alone into the Target store and begins shopping. But as she leaves, prosecutors say this surveillance photo shows her fixated on her phone.",
      "They would tell a grand jury it appears she was streaming video from her home \u2014 a lot of it.",
      "THE EVIDENCE AGAINST MONICA SEMENTILLI",
      "So what was Monica Sementilli watching on her phone that afternoon at about the time her husband was being murdered?",
      "Mary Fulginiti. The phone records and data show that she's connecting to a unique IP address. \u2026 It happens to be the IP address of the house. And there's a large amount of data that's being consumed. And that large amount of data is consistent with video streaming, i.e, the surveillance video of the house.",
      "Surveillance video? According to the DA, it might have been video from her home security cameras.",
      "But could Monica have been watching the actual murder?",
      "Mary Fulginiti: No\u2026 The surveillance cameras in the house are \u2014 are facing outside, but they're not facing in the pool area, which was where Fabio was located at the time. So, they didn't actually capture the murder, but they would capture obviously who was coming and going.",
      "Monica could have been watching everything else, prosecutors say.",
      "Mary Fulginiti (with Miller in the Target parking lot): They're going to argue \u2026 she's watching the scene, the scene of the crime to see the comings and goings of when Baker and the accomplice are going into the house, when are they leaving the house so that she knows when she can leave here and go home.",
      "Prosecutors say while she is watching the feed, Baker and his accomplice were on the Sementilli property stalking Fabio.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: According to the prosecution, \"it was a very targeted attack that was done with the intent to kill.\" They also go on to say that \"he was stabbed in the neck, it cut his jugular vein, cut the carotid artery.\"",
      "And there's more evidence of the plot to kill Fabio. Prosecutors say Baker was planning a future with Monica.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: The DA says that about two months before the murder, Baker told a friend that he had been dating this woman for about a year, and that he sent a picture of that woman, and that woman was Monica.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: And then two months later Fabio was killed.",
      "Authorities also say Monica's behavior after the murder is suspect. She didn't move her teenage daughters out of the house or have her security system repaired.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: And the prosecutors argued that the reason why she had no concern, because she knew who the killer was, and she was with him.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: This is a woman who is pretending to be a grieving widow and making all these posts on social media.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: Who at the same time is carrying on a torrid love affair with the man who actually killed her husband.",
      "Prosecutors made explicit photos public in court filings. Some we can't show you. They say its evidence the secretive romance continued after Fabio's death.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: I mean, that's a double life. \u2026 The D.A. presented a photograph of Monica and \u2014 and Baker to the grand jury. And it was a photograph of Monica actually grabbing his crotch. \u2026 And this was one, uh, that was taken in Vegas.",
      "Michelle Miller: There was also this \u2014 this photo of a mirror.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: Right. \u2026 it was a photo of the back of Monica \u2026 with Mrs. Baker, uh, written lipstick on the mirror.",
      "Michelle Miller: The \u2026 lipstick and the mirror \u2026 What \u2014 what does that tell them?",
      "Mary Fulginiti: Again, this all goes to motive. I mean, Mrs. Baker \u2026 she wanted to be Mrs. Baker.",
      "But when detectives asked Monica about Robert Baker, prosecutors say she told them she wasn't even sure of his last name. They say she also told them she wasn't sure how to work the home security cameras.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: To quote the prosecution here, they say, \"She's a liar, she's a manipulator, she's a cheater. And everything that comes out of her mouth has to be taken with a large grain of salt large enough so that you could choke on it.\"",
      "Mary Fulginiti: If they can show that Monica lied about her lifestyle, about the affair, about a variety of other things, that they'll convince the jury that she's also lying about her involvement in this conspiracy to kill Fabio.",
      "And they say when she was later confronted about why Baker's blood was found in her house, she continued to lie.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: She comes up with some cockamamie story about, you know, playing racquetball with Baker and hitting him in the finger and that it was bleeding and there was a bloody towel and she had to bring it home and \u2014 and that's why his blood was at the house.",
      "But Fulginiti says one of the biggest pieces of evidence against Monica is what happened when police came up with a plan to secretly record the couple. It began when they pulled them over as they were driving.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: It's a ruse by the police. \u2026 They say that they think the car that they're in is stolen and they wanted to, you know, just check it out and you know, probably isn't and they handcuff them per protocol, put them into the police vehicle. But what they don't know is that vehicle's wired and that there's a van up the street with police in it listening to their every word. And it's at that point, Monica says, and I'm gonna quote here: \"Somebody must have talked. Somebody is doing this to us.\" And then she said, \"They must have something. They must have something.\"",
      "Mary Fulginiti: That's pretty damning evidence. \u2026 as a former prosecutor that is close to an admission to being involved in this conspiracy.",
      "According to detectives, Monica was also recorded telling her cellmate, \"He's not just my lover \u2026 he's my confidante \u2026 he's my everything.\"",
      "Detectives also intercepted letters Monica wrote to Baker from behind bars saying, \"I'm always amazed how we both know what the other is thinking. DESTINED!\" And \"I miss you so much my love!\"",
      "Mary Fulginiti: When you look at these pieces in the totality, it's going to put together a pretty perfect puzzle here. And the puzzle will paint this picture that Monica conspired with Baker, that he did not do it alone, that they did it together.",
      "But Monica's defenders say the case against her is flimsy, and they say Baker did it without her.",
      "Julie Rendelman: Robert Baker may have killed him because he wanted him out of the way. Maybe he did it because he hoped that by killing him, he would get Monica to himself. \u2026 That in and of itself does not establish that Monica was in on the murder.",
      "DEFENDING MONICA SEMENTILLI",
      "Monica Sementilli's defense is adamant she had absolutely nothing to do with Fabio's murder.",
      "Julie Rendelman: The defense's position is that there is no hard evidence, actually no evidence that establishes Monica Sementilli participated in conspiracy.",
      "And if you can't prove a conspiracy, you can't prove Monica's guilt says Rendelman.",
      "Michelle Miller: The sheer number of circumstances that seem to weave together\u2014 the parking lot meeting \u2026 the walking into the store and watching video that has streamed live from the home \u2026 the password being given to the killer \u2026 all of those things, the sum of them, wouldn't a jury believe is just too much of a coincidence?",
      "Julie Rendelman: Obviously, I can't answer for what the jury is gonna say. Um, the defense, I could promise you, is going to attempt to poke holes \u2014 holes in every single piece of evidence you just spoke about.",
      "Michelle Miller: So, let's go step-by-step \u2026 the sharing of that password for the surveillance video.",
      "Julie Rendelman: So, there is no question that she shared the password.",
      "But Rendelman says there's no connection between sharing that password and a murder plot.",
      "Julie Rendelman: There's absolutely no evidence between the six months that she shared it and the day he was killed, that establishes there was any plan in place between them whatsoever to have her husband killed, not a text, not an email, not a conversation with her best friend saying she's over her relationship.",
      "Julie Rendelman: The second issue is, there's absolutely no evidence that Robert Baker downloaded the app or ever even used the app.",
      "Michelle Miller: Let's talk about the actions in the parking lot the day of the murder. \u2026 someone appears to be getting into the car.",
      "Julie Rendelman: Keep a couple things in mind. One is from the defense's perspective \u2026 the video footage is so grainy that you can't make out who if anybody is getting into Monica Sementilli's car.",
      "And what about the allegation that she was watching video of the house as the murder took place?",
      "Michelle Miller: Once she went inside the Target \u2014 there was a point in time where she seemed fascinated, fixated on her phone.",
      "Julie Rendelman: Well, I'll tell you one thing. The prosecution doesn't know what she was watching on her phone. They cannot articulate nor will they ever be able to articulate what was going on in that phone.",
      "Michelle Miller: But it was being streamed from her home.",
      "Julie Rendelman: She could be watching a show, just like any one of us watched your show while we're walking along.",
      "Michelle Miller: The prosecution really digs in on Monica's character, the fact that she's having an affair.",
      "Julie Rendelman: Well, let me quote what the defense says in \u2014in regards to that. \"The prosecutor's evidence of Ms. Sementilli's affair and specifically the sexist and lurid manner in which it was presented \u2026 was irrelevant, improper and unfairly prejudicial to Ms. Sementilli.\"",
      "Julie Rendelman: They go on and say, \"the sexual and romantic details of their affair were simply irrelevant to the question, whether they conspired to murder Fabio Sementilli.\"",
      "But then why lie to investigators \u2014 allegedly saying she was unsure of Robert Baker's last name?",
      "Julie Rendelman: The question becomes, why is she lying? Is she lying because she committed a murder or is she lying because she has been in a tryst with someone for quite a while and doesn't want the world to know particularly, law enforcement?",
      "Prosecutors did find it suspicious that on the night Fabio died, Monica was already inquiring about his life insurance. But Rendelman says it's not odd.",
      "Julie Rendelman: I understand, um, how it could look insensitive to start asking about a life insurance policy so soon after. But if you're, uh, an individual that is not financially sound, you have two girls at home, you have potentially a mortgage to pay, you have bills to pay, you are going to be worried about the financial security of your family.",
      "And come trial, says Rendelman, what may really help Monica is that she won't be tried with Baker. \u00a0The jury will not see the man who committed the actual murder at the defense table next to Monica. \u00a0And that could make the case harder for prosecutors, says Fulginiti.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: The fact that he's her lover and the killer, the one that the DNA's around the house, I mean that \u2014 there is a spillover effect. And that all would've, you know, potentially impacted, I think, the jury in this case. And he's no longer there.",
      "Michelle Miller: Would you say it was his last gift to Monica?",
      "Mary Fulginiti: Yeah, I would 'cause there's absolutely no other reason for him actually to plead straight up, without any real plea bargain here, to life without the possibility of parole, except I guess his last murderous chivalrous act.",
      "But it seems Baker may have an even bigger impact on Monica's case. \"48 Hours\" went to see him in jail, and he told us Monica had nothing to do with the murder of Fabio and she never knew that he was Fabio's killer. Baker also told us that he's no longer in touch with Monica and he has not decided if he will testify.",
      "Another factor that could help Monica, says Rendelman, the daughters Monica shared with Fabio are standing behind their mother.",
      "Julie Rendelman: And so, there's an argument to be made that the jury is looking at the daughter saying, \"if they believe her after all this, shouldn't we?\"",
      "As for Monica herself, she's never spoken publicly \u2013 except at a memorial for her deceased husband.",

She was headed to Target where prosecutors said she was establishing her alibi. Before Monica entered the store, according to prosecutors, there is video where it appears an individual got into Monica's truck. Prosecutors said that person was Robert Baker, a local racquetball coach who Monica had been having an affair with for about a year prior to Fabio's murder. Monica's defense attorneys have disputed the prosecution's interpretation of the video from the parking lot. According to the district attorney, Monica then went alone into the Target store and began shopping.",

Prosecutors also said that around the time of Fabio's murder, phone records showed that Monica's iPhone was connected to her home's IP address and her phone was consuming a large amount of data consistent with streaming live video.",
      "The prosecution\u202fstated in pre-trial motions that Monica was monitoring\u202fthe comings and goings at her home so that Baker and the unknown accomplice could enter and kill Fabio \"without any interruption.\" But according to Monica's defense team, there is no evidence that can prove what exactly she was watching on her phone at that time.

      "CASE UPDATE: On April 11, 2025, a jury found Monica Sementilli, the wife of famed hairdresser Fabio Sementilli,\u00a0guilty of murder\u00a0for his 2017 death in which he was beaten and stabbed in their Los Angeles home.",
      "It's an awkward moment sitting down with a murderer especially when you arrive unannounced.",
      "Robert Baker, 61, who pleaded no contest last summer to the 2017 Los Angeles murder of famed hairstylist and beauty industry executive Fabio Sementilli, 49, approached the glass that separated us with a \"who are you?\" look on his face.",
      "As a producer for \"48 Hours\" who has followed the case since 2017, I made the trip to Los Angeles' North County Correctional Facility on March 2 to see if Baker would be willing to share information about the brutal crime and, perhaps, his alleged accomplice\u00a0Monica Sementilli, 52. Monica was the wife of victim\u00a0Fabio Sementilli, and she was Baker's lover before they both landed in jail, nearly five months after the crime, accused of conspiracy to commit murder. Their case is profiled by \"48 Hours\" contributor Michelle Miller in\u00a0\"The Monica Sementilli Affair,\"\u00a0now streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Baker seemed healthy and younger looking than the bedraggled figure I remembered from court. He had the fit and muscular appearance one might expect from a racquetball coach at the LA Fitness where he met Monica Sementilli, a mother of two teenage daughters living in a nearby, upscale L.A. neighborhood.",
      "Once I introduced myself, it was Baker who offered the initial icebreaker to our conversation, expressing surprise at the effort I had taken to find him in that remote jail in the mountain town of Castaic. Getting there can be a one-hour drive from L.A., and visitors are only permitted on Saturdays and Sundays. There are two separate intake areas to pass through, which involves a bus ride \u2013 not to mention security, where a reporter must leave pens, recorders and phones behind.",
      "So, the effort had paid off, it got the conversation started, and earned me credibility for finding him. These meetings can be difficult. The main issue is we are being recorded and the cops and prosecutors who put Baker away and have plans to put his former lover away listen, and presumably can and will use anything he says against him \u2013 or her \u2013 if possible.",
      "Nevertheless, our conversation moved along.\u00a0 Baker had an easy wide smile with a gap between his front teeth. The phone receivers we each used had short cords so that kept us face to face, staring straight into each other's eyes, from about 20 inches apart through safety glass.",
      "Despite his reluctance to address most issues, deferring answers to \"when this is all over\" (meaning the end of Monica's upcoming trial which starts April 2), he was resolute about one point: Monica was not involved in the murder, as she is charged.",
      "\"Monica did not know.\u00a0 She didn't know s***.\u00a0 If she did find out, I would have been in here (jail) a lot sooner,\" he said. His claim was a bombshell.\u00a0 Monica, who has already spent nearly six years in jail, did not conspire with him to kill her husband Fabio, he said.",
      "Despite what the prosecutor characterizes as overwhelming circumstantial evidence against Monica, there is no smoking gun connecting her to the conspiracy.\u00a0 A fact her attorneys are banking on for a not guilty verdict at trial.",
      "Why did Robert Baker plead guilty without a deal?",
      "I asked about his decision to plead no contest despite not getting a deal and accepting the sentence of life without parole. With his blood and DNA at the crime scene, having cut his finger stabbing Fabio to death, Baker had little chance to beat the charges. But even if his chances at trial were one in a million, most people take that shot. \"Why not you?\" I asked him.",
      "He seemed resigned to his fate but explained \"due process\" was the reason. Much of our conversation shifted to facial expressions, as he was clearly reluctant to be recorded saying certain things. I found myself unconsciously following his lead \u2014   and at that moment, I gave him an exaggerated \"What does that mean?\" face.",
      "\"You think there's due process?\" he responded to my look, as if I was the naivest person on earth to have faith in the criminal justice system that snared him.\u00a0 The phrase due process would serve as his unsatisfying default answer for many substantive questions.",
      "I asked if his plea was \"a gift\" for Monica, which he immediately scoffed at, seemingly taking offense, as if going down for life could be a gift.",
      "I pointed out, what he knew well, that for more than five years Monica's attorneys had tried many times to sever the cases against the lovebirds into separate trials, but the judge denied them at each turn.\u00a0 So, I noted when Baker pleaded no contest, voil\u00e0, thanks to his decision, Monica got what she had been asking for, to stand trial alone.\u00a0 He remained dismissive.",
      "I asked if he had met Monica in a Target parking lot two miles from the Sementilli home in the hours before the murder, as the prosecutor alleged, presumably to get the 'coast is clear' message from Monica to attack and kill Fabio.",
      "That allegation prompted an eyes wide open, lips pursed, \"no way\" expression as he shook his head back and forth. It never happened, according to him.",
      "He complained about that and other prosecution evidence. The fact that he and Monica used the encrypted apps WhatsApp and Viber to communicate between themselves, or that Monica shared her family's home security system's private log-in credentials with him. So what? he asked.",
      "I pointed out that while millions of Americans did use encrypted apps and accessed home security systems remotely, an objective person, say, a juror, might well find it suspicious that the lovers shared those prior to Fabio's murder. Baker remained indignant that those facts could be used against him or Monica.",
      "What about his Facebook messages with a friend where Baker said, \"No not yet living with her [Monica] but it's coming soon.\"\u00a0 Once again, Baker shrugged that off, \"just a conversation between friends.\" That explanation put the incredulous \"Huh?\" look on my face.",
      "\"Just a conversation between friends,\" he repeated with a shrug and a \"that's all\" expression. He just did not seem to get the prosecutor's point that a conversation between friends is precisely what was so revealing, and potentially incriminating \u00a0particularly because he murdered Fabio soon after.",
      "Robert Baker's sentence: Life without parole",
      "I turned the conversation to his sentencing hearing where numerous family members assailed him for taking away Fabio, a man so loved by two daughters, a son, two sisters and an immense family and circle of friends.",
      "\"Heartbreaking,\" he repeated a few times, \"heartbreaking.\" Baker had cried during the hearing, perhaps when Monica's daughters testified. What they may have seen as crocodile tears decidedly did not make an impression on the devastated family members and friends.",
      "I asked if that emotion at the hearing meant he wanted to apologize to Fabio's family. He offered nothing in reply just repeating, \"heartbreaking.\"\u00a0 \"I'm not the monster,\" he said, his voice trailing off before I could hear a finished thought.",
      "At that point, I had to interject, explaining that I had seen the autopsy report. Fabio had been viciously stabbed seven times, three separate wounds each deemed fatal as vital arteries were targeted. A beloved father, brother, son, friend, ambushed and slaughtered without a chance to defend himself.",
      "\"I know, I know,\" he said, dropping his head without meeting my eyes. He said only very recently had he seen the crime scene photos of Fabio \u2013 the gore and violence of the murder juxtaposed with the backdrop: Fabio's chair, where his family remembers him smoking cigars, \"Big Daddy\" baseball cap on his head, conducting business, and enjoying life in his favorite domain - the back patio.",
      "It was Fabio's then 16-year-old daughter who would find his body \u2013 too heavy as deadweight for her to even turn him over.",
      "Will Robert Baker testify at Monica Sementilli's trial?",
      "Earlier in our conversation, Baker conceded that he had recently been meeting with Monica's defense attorneys. Ostensibly, they are sizing Baker up for the possibility that he might testify at Monica's trial and drop that aforementioned bombshell on the jurors: that Monica was not involved, that she had no knowledge, that she never suspected her lover as the killer.",
      "Baker told me he does not know whether he will testify or not.",
      "I asked if he wanted to testify \"for her?\" For the second time, he took offense. \"I would not do it for her,\" he said. \"It would be to tell the truth.\"",
      "The idea that he might testify was heralded by her defense lawyers as a case closer.",
      "\"We are confident that Robert Baker's guilty plea and his truthful testimony will finally establish once and for all that Monica Sementilli had nothing to do with the planning or the murder of Fabio Sementilli, her husband,\" said veteran L.A. criminal defense attorney Leonard Levine after Baker's sentencing.",
      "Legal experts that \"48 Hours\" spoke to were more circumspect. They acknowledged the power of that potential testimony. They also pointed out a jury might be skeptical after a withering cross-examination and an exploration of Baker's background. Baker's testimony represented a risky proposition, they reasoned \u2014 likely too risky.",
      "Background was a question Baker raised. I responded that I was aware of his acting experience in the industry \u2014 the porn industry. Baker nodded his approval at my research. It seemed odd, as if \u2014 like so many people that reporters deal with in Hollywood \u2014 Baker was asserting, 'I was an actor you know,'\u00a0rather than displaying unease with the courtroom optics of pornography.",
      "Our time was limited, so I chose not to raise his criminal background, a conviction for having sex with a minor, his teenage stepdaughter, who would marry him after his release from prison in the 1990s and enter the pornography world, doing movies with Baker. It seemed to be a tangent.",
      "Rather, I wanted to discuss the prosecution's claim that Monica was leading a double life after Fabio's murder.\u00a0 Prosecutors alleged she was expressing an outward appearance through social media that she was deeply in grief over the loss of her husband, while police simultaneously, surreptitiously documented a secretive, fun-filled romance with Baker \u2014 the killer.",
      "Baker chose not to shrug off this accusation, insisting that Monica's grief over Fabio's murder was intense and sincere. As validation, he offered that the two were no longer in contact and that she cursed him with her parting words, \"Murderer motherf*****,\" yelled across a hallway in lock up. He was alleging that once Monica learned Baker was the killer, she dropped him, but he did not say when.",
      "Another bombshell, the claim that their relationship was now over, as court documents had revealed 2017 love letters signed \"your wifey\u2026 Monica Baker 'til death,\" sent in jail. When a sheriff's deputy suddenly appeared, Baker turned and left, ending our interview abruptly.",
      "Outside I waited for my bus next to a sign that read \"Beware of Mountain Lions, Do Not Leave Children Unattended.\"\u00a0 Relishing the fresh, crisp, mountain air, I reflected on a lively, yet guarded, conversation that yielded glimpses of candor whether intentional or inadvertent from a murderer.",

    "story": [
      "CASE UPDATE: On April 11, 2025, a jury found Monica Sementilli, the wife of famed hairdresser Fabio Sementilli, guilty of murder for his 2017 death in which he was beaten and stabbed in their Los Angeles home.",
      "When Monica Sementilli and Robert Baker were arrested and accused of a murder conspiracy to kill Monica's husband, Fabio Sementilli, 49, their love affair continued in jail according to documents revealed in a \"48 Hours\" investigation of the case. Prosecutors allege their ongoing love affair behind bars, including recordings made during police sting operations, represent further evidence of a committed murder conspiracy between the lovebirds.",
      "\"It kind of hurts to not be touched or f***** or licked or loved by you,\" Monica, now 52, writes in one four-page letter to her codefendant. Baker, now 61, is blunt, recorded addressing Sementilli in lockup months after their arrest, \"I love you baby. I really do.\"",
      "On June 14, 2017, Baker and Monica were arrested and ultimately indicted for Fabio's murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Baker pleaded no contest\u00a0in July 2023, accepting a life sentence without parole. Monica will stand trial alone in April; she has pleaded not guilty. Their case is profiled by \"48 Hours\" contributor Michelle Miller in \"The Monica Sementilli Affair\" now streaming on Paramount+.",
      "On the day of their arrest, according to a recording released by police, Monica tells a cellmate how much Baker means to her: \"He's not just my lover, he's my confidant, he's my everything.\"",
      "Police engaged in an elaborate series of sting operations to continue to investigate the alleged conspiracy between the defendants even while they were held in custody, \"48 Hours\" has discovered. Police alternately used standard and creative means to intercept or record the defendants' interactions and statements, all of which is being offered as evidence of conspiracy in Monica's upcoming trial.",
      "For instance, \"48 Hours\" has confirmed that the cellmate to whom Monica spoke when she was first detained was an undercover police officer posing as an inmate to catch Monica speaking candidly on surreptitious recordings. Police call these types of jailhouse setups where officers pose as inmates inside jail Perkins Operations, referring to the case law which guides how these in-jail, sting operations are conducted.",
      "In the course of our investigation, \"48 Hours\" has learned that police went to even greater lengths than using undercover officers inside cells to ensnare Monica and Baker. As the two defendants were brought to courtrooms for their initial pre-trial hearings, detectives made arrangements for them to be held in adjoining cells prior to the hearings.",
      "Waiting in nearby cells to be brought into the courtroom, Monica and Baker had an opportunity to speak directly to each other. On six different occasions, first at the Van Nuys Courthouse and then at the downtown Los Angeles criminal courthouse, interactions between Monica and Baker were recorded.",
      "Beyond the sting operations, detectives also intercepted jail letters, referred to by inmates as \"kites,\" and listened to recorded jail phone calls to establish facts about the enduring love affair between Monica and Baker.",
      "\"48 Hours\" has obtained copies of three different jail love letters written from Monica to Baker which we have learned police intercepted while Monica intended to pass them to Baker in courthouse holding cells. \"48 Hours\" has learned that the detectives discovered the letters in holding cells while Monica and Baker attended the hearings. The detectives hastily made copies before carefully returning them for the inmates to retrieve after the hearings so that the defendants were unaware the love letters had been intercepted and copied.",
      "Meanwhile, Monica's defense has repeatedly argued, \"the sexual and romantic details of their affair were simply irrelevant to the question whether they conspired to murder Fabio Sementilli.\"",
      "According to prosecutors the information gleaned from these operations establishes that the ongoing jailhouse love affair is further evidence of the murder conspiracy between the accused.",
      "\"In essence, the defendants have promised one another that neither will cooperate with law enforcement or testify against the other to save themselves. Rather, they have promised one another that neither will cooperate with law enforcement or testify against the other to save themselves,\" wrote Deputy District Attorney Beth Silverman.",
      "The unusual situation where the two inmates could speak to each other while detained was designed by law enforcement purposely to record conversations between the unwitting defendants.",
      "Monica Sementilli and Robert Baker used secret code to express love and commitment inside jail, prosecutors cite as evidence of murder conspiracy",
      "According to a 2021 motion filed by the prosecutor, the recordings and intercepted love letters are evidence of an ongoing \"secrecy pact\" between the accused.",
      "\"The defendants often communicated with one another using cryptic language, phrases and codes created in order to secretly communicate without law enforcement's knowledge,\" including, \"the phrases, 'OMM,' '9pm,' 'LOML,' and '100,'\" according to a prosecution filing.",
      "Prosecutors allege these coded phrases establish the defendants' love and commitment not only to each other, but also the \"conspiracy\" and \"secrecy pact\" between them. \"OMM,\" they allege, means \"On My Mind,\" while they say \"9pm\" is a reference to a secretive plan to break jail rules and set timing for a phone call where a third party will connect the two to speak directly. The prosecutors contend \"LOML\" is an \"acronym meaning 'Love of My Life' and '100' indicates their 100% commitment to one another.\"",
      "According to prosecutors, another significant phrase is the one written at the end of one of Monica's love letters, \"R or D,\" an alleged abbreviation for the phrase \"Ride or Die.\"",
      "Detectives found a drawing \"depicting a couple embracing one another wearing only underwear and ski masks while holding guns\" in Baker's cellphone \"entitled 'Ride or Die.'\" There is a statement above the drawing, \"A relationship where you both love, protect and spoil each other is the best.\"",
      "\"The phrase 'Ride or Die' was frequently used between the defendants as an expression of their commitment to one another and their secrecy pact. On several occasions defendants expressed that they would remain loyal to one another, and never 'talk' to law enforcement about their conspiracy; in their words, they would 'Ride or Die' for one another,\" the 2021 filing asserts.",
      "Robert Baker and Monica Sementilli allegedly play sex games during recorded jailhouse encounters arranged and recorded by police",
      "The two lovers took advantage of six rendezvous engineered by detectives, according to motions filed in court. Monica and Baker were recorded \"talking to one another and engaging in masturbation and other sex games,\" wrote the prosecutor. The judge has ruled the alleged sex games portions of these recordings will not be admissible. Nevertheless, these encounters purportedly reveal the passionate nature of their continuing relationship in jail.",
      "Baker confirmed the sex games during an exclusive jailhouse interview with \"48 Hours\" on March 2. That's what happens when you are stuck in here, he said, gesturing to the jail side of the glass from where he talked to a reporter over a phone.",
      "Once those encounters stopped, the jailhouse co-defendants and lovebirds found ways to break the rules and remain in contact, according to prosecutors. In that 2021 filing, prosecutors said \"over the course of the last four years, the defendants made hundreds of calls through third parties \u2026 This allows them to speak to one another.\"",
      "These phone recordings have been shared with the defense as discovery but have not been made public.",
      "In excerpts reviewed by \"48 Hours\" from two of the six recorded encounters, there is talk of marriage, and in her letters, Monica consistently refers to herself as \"Mrs. Baker,\" \"Monica Baker\" and \"your wifey.\" \"MB\" is a code prosecutors allege is an abbreviation of Monica Baker.",
      "\"The defendants have continued to refer to one another as husband and wife while in custody for murdering Sementilli's legitimate husband,\" wrote the prosecutor, who cites this as dedication, not only to each other, but also to their murder conspiracy.",
      "Before the grand jury, prosecutor Silverman argued that the lovers' commitment motivated the conspiracy, saying they were \"plotting to kill [Fabio] in order to collect his substantial life insurance monies and be able to live hopefully happily ever after.\"",
      "Monica's attorneys have repeatedly challenged the evidence of a love affair as irrelevant to proving evidence of a murder conspiracy. There is no doubt, however, that Monica and Baker's\u00a0 commitment to their affair endured at least during the early months in jail, even for years according to the prosecutor.",
      "\"We will get married \u2026 You are the perfect wife for me. Beyond belief. My mind is like, I'm delirious,\" Baker says to Monica in a lockup recording.",
      "Similarly, she gushes to her lover as she ends a three-page-long letter, or \"kite,\" intercepted on Aug. 6, 2017, with \"Love your wifey\u2026 Monica Baker 'til death. R or D\"",
      "In jail sting, Robert Baker mentions Monica Sementilli facing \"difficulty\" of being \"disowned\" for loving and wanting to marry him",
      "\"48 Hours\" has identified one comment relating to this alleged jailhouse marriage talk that may indicate a separate issue at play in the murder conspiracy allegations.",
      "During the grand jury hearings, prosecutor Silverman argued divorce was not an option for Monica, so the couple instead turned to murder.",
      "\"She's from an Italian family, which means Catholic. They don't believe in divorce, her family won't, it won't be easy for them to take it \u2026 So again this provides a motive,\" said Silverman.",
      "Monica's defense attorneys have challenged this testimony as flimsy and misinterpreted, insisting the prosecutor has not established that divorce troubled Monica.",
      "However, in one of the recorded conversations between Baker and Monica on Aug. 31, 2017, which police refer to as \"lockup overhears,\" Baker seems to make a stunning admission regarding Monica while they discuss their desire to get married.",
      "\"So, when you gonna tell them \u2026 when you \u2026 when you gonna tell them \u2026 how we gonna tell 'em we're gonna get married? How we gonna do this? Then you'll really be officially disowned for loving somebody,\" Baker says in a seeming reference to Monica getting disowned for their relationship. Monica responds, \"I don't know \u2026 I think we may need to wait \u2026 until the trial, and see what happens with that.\"",
      "Baker then says, \"I'm not the one that has the, difficulty you do.\"",
      "The transcript made public in the prosecutor's motion is only an incomplete excerpt of the conversation. Nevertheless, this portion of the jailhouse exchange recorded by the Los Angeles Police Department seems to establish that Monica being \"disowned\" over her love for Baker may have been an issue for the lovers. Furthermore, Baker seems to confirm it as a \"difficulty\" for Monica. It is a tantalizing piece of a conversation, raising a significant issue that will almost certainly come into play during her trial.",
      "Monica's defense attorneys \"are not commenting on any evidence until it is presented at trial,\" said veteran L.A. criminal defense attorney Leonard Levine.",
      "Although it is unclear if the two defendants remain in contact today, after six years of incarceration, evidence appears to demonstrate the stunning revelation they remained dedicated to a relationship in the months after their arrest, perhaps extending for years. These love letters, sex games and promises seem to have continued even after Monica learned that evidence implicated Baker as her husband's killer.",
      "In an exclusive jailhouse interview with \"48 Hours,\" Baker claimed that now the two are prevented from contacting each other.\u00a0 He said, the last time they spoke, in a random encounter passing each other in lockup, she cursed him as a murderer. He did not indicate when this exchange occurred.",
      "Calling Baker a murderer would represent a significant turn in Monica's attitude, as evidenced through August 2017 in the jail letters and recordings. In his interview with \"48 Hours,\" Baker claimed that Monica took no part in a murder conspiracy and that he acted without her knowledge.",
      "Prosecutors dismiss the idea that Monica was not involved, detailing 56 overt acts which they argue constitute the conspiracy between the two lovers to murder the celebrity hairstylist turned beauty industry executive.",
      "Monica's defense attorneys intend to call Baker as a witness during Monica's trial.",
      "\"We are confident that Robert Baker's guilty plea and his truthful testimony will finally establish once and for all that Monica Sementilli had nothing to do with the planning or the murder of Fabio Sementilli, her husband,\" said Levine after Baker's sentencing.",
      "Whether or not Monica Sementilli's love affair with killer Robert Baker constitutes evidence of a criminal conspiracy or simply passionate infidelity will be at the heart of Fabio's wife's trial for his murder. Prosecutors plan to enter details of that love affair dating as far back as one year before the crime, continuing after Fabio's murder, and as revealed by \"48 Hours\"' investigation, even while the two were locked up awaiting trial.",

      "After one of the most turbulent weeks on Wall Street in recent history, stocks ended higher on Friday, with investors setting aside concerns \u2014 at least temporarily \u2014 about the growing trade war between the U.S. and China.",
      "The S&P 500 gained 95 points, or 1.8%, to 5,363, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 619 points, or 1.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 2.1%.",
      "After a week full of monstrous swings, the S&P 500 posted its best weekly performance since November 23, while the Nasdaq saw its best week since November 2022, according to the financial data firm FactSet. Even so, economists are cautioning that the growing trade war between the U.S. and China could crimp the nation's growth.",
      "\"'Rollercoaster' is not a technical term but it is probably the best adjective to describe price action across equity markets this week,\" noted Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial, in an email.",
      "Beijing on Friday announced that it would raise tariffs on U.S. goods to 125%. That matches the 125% duties on Chinese goods that President Trump\u00a0announced this week\u00a0\u2014 those tariffs will rise to as much as 145% for some of the Asian nation's products.",
      "\"The U.S. alternately raising abnormally high tariffs on China has become a numbers game, which has no practical economic significance, and will become a joke in the history of the world economy,\" a Chinese finance ministry spokesman said in a statement announcing the new tariffs. \"However, if the U.S. insists on continuing to substantially infringe on China's interests, China will resolutely counter and fight to the end.\"",
      "Pressure also eased a bit from within the U.S. bond market. The typically more boring corner of Wall Street has been flashing signals of stress this week that have been serious enough to demand attention from both Wall Street and President Trump.",
      "\"China's tit-for-tat retaliation in its rapidly escalating trade war with the U.S. exerted some renewed pressure on equities and the dollar today, with bonds still buffeted by expectations of monetary easing and signs of market dislocation,\" John Higgins, chief market economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.",
      "Gold prices rose more than 2% to $3,250 per ounce Friday following China's tariff hike as investors crowd into safe havens.",
      "The S&P 500 remains down nearly 13% from its latest peak on Feb. 19, while the Dow and Nasdaq have fallen 12% and 17%, respectively.",
      "Those declines reflect investor concerns about the impact of multilateral tariffs on corporate profits and on the broader economy, with some analysts raising the odds of a recession.",
      "\"While the White House has tried hard in the last 1.5 days to spin things positively on trade, with a lot of talk about negotiations, investors are seeing through the noise and realize the irreparable damage inflicted on the global economy from Trump's reckless tariff campaign,\" equities analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, told investors in a research note.",
      "The news for markets isn't uniformly grim. The Dow soared nearly 3,000 points on Wednesday, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq enjoyed their biggest one-day gains in decades after Mr. Trump\u00a0paused \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of countries, with the exception of China, for 90 days.",
      "Inflation in March also cooled more than forecasters expected, while recent signs show the job market remains resilient. How long those plates can keep spinning is unclear, especially as tariffs start nudging up costs for American consumers.",

    "summary": "Some people whose homes survived the Eaton wildfire in January are struggling to convince their insurers to test their properties for safety.",
    "story": [
      "All sense of survivors' guilt was fleeting for those residents whose homes remained standing after wildfires ripped through the Los Angeles area three months ago.",
      "Many worried that smoke from the Eaton wildfire that destroyed more than 9,000 structures and killed 18 people may have carried toxins, including lead, asbestos and heavy metals, into their homes. But they struggled to convince their insurers to test their properties to ensure it was safe to return.",
      "Nicole Maccalla, a data scientist, said embers burned more than half of her roof, several windows and eaves were damaged, and her house in Altadena was left filled with ash, debris, soot and damaged appliances. She said her insurance adjuster said USAA would pay for contamination testing, but after choosing a company and coming back with the results, her claim was rejected. The adjuster said the company only covered testing in homes with major damage.",
      "\"Every single item is a battle,\" said Maccalla. \"It's denials and appeals and denials and appeals, and you wait weeks and weeks and weeks for responses.\"",
      "Maccalla and others banded together as Eaton Fire Residents United, sharing indoor environmental testing data and compiling the results in an online map. Of 81 homes tested so far for lead, all show elevated levels, according to the group.",
      "\"I've already had multiple people reach out and say: 'Thank you for publishing this map \u2026 because my insurance company has changed their mind and approved testing,'\" said Maccalla, who helped design the data collection to verify results and maintain privacy.",
      "Many homeowners paid privately for the testing after their insurance companies refused, revealing gaps in coverage. The group hopes the data will help residents who can't afford it to convince their insurers to cover testing and remediation.",
      "\"If I can prove my community is not fit for human habitation then maybe I can show my home won't be,\" said Jane Lawton Potelle, founder of Eaton Fire Residents United.",
      "It's not easy to understand how and when it is safe to return home, Potelle said. The fine print of insurance policies can be frustrating and confusing, and the government has not stepped in to help.",
      "No help from FEMA",
      "The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it has no plans to conduct widespread environmental testing. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health is tracking environmental testing largely by academic researchers and a handful from government agencies, but most studies assess outdoor contamination.",
      "Reports from other urban wildfires, in which building materials, appliances, cars and more burn at incredibly high temperatures, show increased levels of heavy metals including lead and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as benzene that are tied to negative health risks. But insurance companies haven't standardized testing for those contaminants.",
      "Home insurance broadly covers fire damage, but there is a growing dispute over what damage must be covered when flames don't torch the property.",
      "California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara released a bulletin in March that put the onus on companies to properly investigate reported smoke damage, saying they cannot deny such claims without investigating thoroughly, including paying for professional testing as warranted. But many residents have been left to fight for coverage anyway.",
      "Janet Ruiz, spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute that represents many major insurance companies, said it's hard to compare neighbors because every claim is unique due to each home's physical structure, actual damage and defined insurance coverage limits.",
      "\"It can vary and insurance companies are sensitive to what the claim is,\" Ruiz said. \"You have to work with your insurance companies and be reasonable about what may have happened.\"",
      "Disputes over fire damage coverage",
      "Dave Jones, director of the Climate Risk Initiative at University of California, Berkeley, and former state insurance commissioner, said testing should be covered even though some insurance companies disagree.",
      "\"It's perfectly reasonable for people to have some kind of environmental test done so that their home is safe and their property is safe,\" Jones said. \"We're talking about very catastrophically high temperature fires where all sorts of materials are melted and some of them become toxic.\"",
      "The state's insurer of last resort, known as the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, has been scrutinized for years over how it handles smoke damage claims. A 2017 change to the FAIR Plan limited coverage to \"permanent physical changes,\" meaning smoke damage must be visible or detectable without lab testing for claims to be approved. State officials said that threshold was too high and illegal, and ordered a change.",
      "Dylan Schaffer, an attorney leading a class action lawsuit challenging FAIR Plan's threshold, said he was surprised private carriers are disputing similar fire damage claims.",
      "\"The damage is not due to smoke, the damage is contamination from fire,\" Schaffer said. \"They make it complicated because it saves them money.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Altadena residents on the FAIR Plan say their claims are still being denied. Jones believes the debate will only end when lawmakers take action.",
      "FAIR Plan spokeswoman Hilary McLean declined to comment on the ongoing litigation and individual cases, but said the FAIR Plan pays all covered claims based on the adjusters' recommendations.",
      "\"Our policy, like many others, requires direct physical loss for there to be coverage,\" McLean said.",
      "Potelle said the first inkling that her house might be toxic came after meeting with her AAA insurance adjuster in the days after the fire. Even though she had worn a mask, her chest still ached and her voice rasped, and she wondered whether her home was safe for her 11-year-old.",
      "Stephanie Wilcox said her toddler's pediatrician recommended testing their home. Her Farmers Insurance policy includes coverage for lead and asbestos in addition to her wildfire coverage, but after multiple denials, she paid out of pocket.",
      "\"After the initial inspection, (Farmers) had told us remediation would cost about $12,000 and that it would be habitable, like we could move back in tomorrow,\" she said. \"But now there's no way.\"",
      "She plans to ask for a new estimate including lead abatement and other costs, citing the results.",
      "Similarly, Zach Bailey asked in late January for contamination testing. The house he shares with his wife and toddler sits in an island of largely spared homes among blocks wiped out by the fire. After months of denials, State Farm agreed to pay for lead and asbestos testing because the remediation company cited federal worker safety regulations.",
      "It shouldn't have been that hard, he said.",

      "Dame CEO Alexandra Fine said the fee doesn't cover all of its extra costs and that the company is analyzing its pricing given that most of its products are made in China. \"Our whole industry is in China, so we've already seen the impact,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Fine also said she wants to be transparent with customers about what is happening, rather than quietly inflating prices.",
      "\"The intention of adding the Trump tariff surcharge as a line item at checkout was to remind people that this is an extra tax on us. I wanted people to understand why it's more expensive \u2014 that it's because of political decisions that were made,\" she said.",
      "Other companies are also moving to raise prices. In a quarterly earnings call last month, a senior executive with U.S. chip maker Micron said some of its products would be subject to higher U.S. tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China and that it plans to \"pass those costs along to our customers.\"",
      "Honeywell Building Automation, which designs safety and efficiency systems for buildings, in early March announced new pricing related to fresh tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. The company started applying a 6.4% \"tariff surcharge\" on its building management systems, excluding software and subscription services, saying the move was necessary \"to mitigate the impact of tariffs.\" Honeywell also said it would eliminate the extra duty \"as soon as such tariffs are no longer in force.\"",
      "Lemonade out of lemons",
      "Other companies are using the situation as a promotional tool. While it's true that consumers could eventually pay more if they wait to purchase furniture, electronics, automobiles and more, \"pre-tariff sales\" play into consumers' fear that prices could rise, and can be an effective way to boost sales, according to experts.",
      "\"The tariffs are injecting uncertainty into the marketplace and when there is high uncertainty, consumers tend to overestimate their losses, so they try to hedge their losses as much as possible in a very irrational way,\" Denish Shah, professor of marketing at Georgia State University's Robinson College of Business, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "And in times of market uncertainty, explains Denish, consumers are prone to panic-buying.",
      "\"They tend to stockpile necessities, fearing that tomorrow, suddenly, prices could go up. So they'll say, 'Let me try to accelerate all the purchases I can that I would have made anyway,'\" he said.",
      "That said, consumers' overarching goal, particularly after battling years of relentless inflation, is to save money. \"Consumers are very price-sensitive in this environment, so they are going to react very strongly to sales that companies are promoting,\" Shah added.",
      "The pre-tariff sales strategy is already working for some sellers, such as Burlap & Barrel, a spice company that imports single-origin spices from around the world. It sources ingredients from small farms in Guatemala, Iceland, India, Spain, Turkey, Vietnam and more. Over the weekend, the spice importer announced\u00a0a \"spring cleaning-turned-impromptu Tariff sale,\" marking down all products by 20%, through Tuesday.",
      "\"When we planned this sale, we thought it'd be a routine springtime promotion, but in the last few days it has turned into something very, very different,\" Burlap & Barrel wrote in a social media post. The company said that it's waiting to see how tariffs are applied to its products, but it's sure that they \"will be bad for our business,\" given that it cannot easily overhaul its supply chains.",
      "The company states that it is running the sale \"To show that we're serious about not raising our prices, and to finance another year or purchasing from smallholder farmers in the face of economic instability and political crisis.\"",
      "Another company, Freewrite, sent an email to customers on Friday urging them to buy its digital typewriters before it hikes prices on its China-made products next week due to the tariffs.",
      "\"Everyone, including our contract manufacturing partners, is helping us explore our options, but the truth is that it is incredibly difficult to move factories. It takes careful planning, huge expense and much more time than we have,\" Freewrite CEO Adam Leeb wrote in the email. \"On Monday, we will be raising prices. Not because we want to, but because we have to.\"",
      "Large chains are putting their own spin on tariff-related promotions. Furniture maker Raymour & Flanigan is urging customers to \"lock in pre-tariff pricing\" in a banner on its website.

    "story": [
      "Jena, Louisiana \u2014 An immigration judge in Louisiana on Friday allowed the Trump administration to move forward with its effort to deport Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil, upholding one of the deportation grounds cited by the government.",
      "Assistant Chief Immigration Judge Jamee Comans ruled that the administration's determination that Khalil poses \"adverse foreign policy consequences\" for the U.S. is \"facially reasonable\" and makes Khalil deportable.",
      "The judge gave Khalil's lawyers until April 23 to file applications for relief to stop his deportation to Syria or Algeria on this ground. Khalil was born in Syria but is a citizen of Algeria, according to court documents.",
      "Comans held in abeyance the second deportation ground cited by the Trump administration: a claim that Khalil committed immigration fraud because he allegedly omitted information about his work history in his green card application.",
      "Comans made the determinations Friday afternoon, inside the courtroom of the privately operated U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Jena where Khalil has been held for weeks.",
      "Khalil, a vocal member of the protests at Columbia University over the war in Gaza, was arrested in early March by ICE, outside of his New York City apartment, where he lived with his pregnant U.S. citizen wife.",
      "After Comans issued her ruling, Khalil, attired in a blue uniform and sandals, asked to be allowed to give remarks.",
      "Khalil noted that the judge had previously talked about \"due process and fundamental fairness,\" and the former Columbia student said those principles were not followed in his case.",
      "Khalil said the Trump administration shipped him \"1,000 miles away\" from his family. He concluded by telling the judge that the cases of other migrants detained here at the ICE facility in Jena, Louisiana should also be addressed with urgency.",
      "After the hearing, Marc van der Hout, an attorney for Khalil, said in a statement, \"Today, we saw our worst fears play out: Mahmoud was subject to a charade of due process, a flagrant violation of his right to a fair hearing, and a weaponization of immigration law to suppress dissent. This is not over, and our fight continues.\"",
      "\"If Mahmoud can be targeted in this way, simply for speaking out for Palestinians and exercising his constitutionally protected right to free speech, this can happen to anyone over any issue the Trump administration dislikes,\" van der Hout added.",
      "The government hasn't charged Khalil with any crime, but it has argued in immigration court that he should be stripped of his green card and deported on two civil immigration grounds.",
      "The Trump administration has invoked a rarely used provision of immigration law that allows the government to seek the deportation of noncitizens whose \"presence or activities\" are determined to \"have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\"",
      "Faced with a deadline this week to provide evidence against Khalil, the Department of Homeland Security filed a memorandum by Secretary of State Marco Rubio outlining the foreign policy rationale.",
      "Rubio cited no specific evidence against Khalil, a 30-year-old legal permanent resident whose American citizen wife is in the late stages of pregnancy. But he said Khalil's presence in the country undermines \"U.S. policy to combat anti-Semitism around the world and in the United States, in addition to efforts to protect Jewish students from harassment and violence in the United States.\"",
      "The Trump government has separately alleged that Khalil committed immigration fraud by failing to disclose certain information in his green card application, including his work for the British Embassy in Beirut and the United Nations agency for Palestinian migrants and refugees.",

There's no beginning and no end to that kind of executive power,\" said Johnny Sinodis, an attorney for Khalil's immigration case, on Thursday.",
      "Khalil has separately sued the government over his arrest, detention and the effort to deport him. That case, in federal court in New Jersey, seeks an order that would require Khalil's release and the rescinding of the Rubio determination.

    "story": [
      "Federal prosecutors were directed by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi this week to pursue the death penalty against Luigi Mangione, the man accused of murdering United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson last year in New York City.",
      "Mangione allegedly shot Thompson as the executive was headed to a health care conference on Dec. 4, killing the father of two on the street. The 26-year-old faces federal murder and stalking charges and 11 state charges, including murder and terrorism charges, which are not eligible for the death penalty.",
      "\"After careful consideration, I have directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in this case as we carry out President Trump's agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again,\" Bondi said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "Mr. Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office directing the Department of Justice to seek the death penalty where applicable.",
      "Attorneys for Luigi Mangione asked a judge to stop federal prosecutors from seeking the death penalty against their client, saying the U.S. government \"intends to kill Mr. Mangione as a political stunt.\"",
      "The motion filed 11 days after the death penalty announcement in the U.S. District Court of the Southern District said U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi\u00a0ordered\u00a0the death penalty to \"carry out President Trump's agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again.\"",
      "\"This move is one in a series of moves for the Trump administration to 'restore' the federal death penalty,\" said Corinna Barrett Lain, death penalty expert and a law professor at the University of Richmond School of Law.",
      "The Mangione case is the first high-profile one to come under his administration's directive, Lain said; however, the federal death row landscape has changed dramatically since Mr. Trump's first term \u2014 and the appetite for executions nationwide has plummeted. In 2024, there were 26 new death sentences; in 2004, there were 125, she said.",
      "New York State, where Mangione is charged, abolished the death penalty in 2007, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a not-for-profit organization based in D.C. According to their tracking, although there were prisoners on New York's death row in 2007,\u00a0an execution hasn't taken place there since Eddie Mays in 1963.",
      "Federal prosecutors might find themselves in the same situation with Mangione, Lain said, who has written a book on lethal injection, as it can take a federal death penalty case at least two decades to wind its way through the legal system.",
      "What is the federal death penalty?",
      "The federal death penalty is in all 50 states and U.S. ter\u00adri\u00adto\u00adries but is used rel\u00ada\u00adtive\u00adly rarely compared to the use of capital punishment by states. How it is applied is decided by a policy the U.S. Department of Justice has written in its justice manual, Robin Maher, executive director of the Death Information Policy Center, told CBS News.",
      "The manual details how \u2014 or why \u2014 federal prosecutors decide to seek a federal death sentence, said Maher.",
      "\"It's not clear that that process has been followed with respect to this decision to seek death for Mr. Mangione,\" Maher said.",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice said the death penalty can only be imposed on defendants convicted of capital offenses, such as murder, treason, genocide, or the killing or kidnapping of a congressman, the president, or a Supreme Court justice. Mr. Trump expanded the scope in his January executive order, saying federal prosecutors will seek the death penalty \"for the most serious, readily provable offenses.\"",
      "Each case is autho\u00adrized by the Department of Justice headquarters in Washington, D.C., in con\u00adsul\u00adta\u00adtion with local U.S. Attorney offices, who prosecute the cases.",
      "What is a federal execution?",
      "A num\u00adber of fed\u00ader\u00adal death sen\u00adtences were pros\u00ade\u00adcut\u00aded in states that have abol\u00adished the death penal\u00adty, the Death Information Policy Center said. Inmates who have received a federal death sentence are executed at the fed\u00ader\u00adal death cham\u00adber in the U.S. Penitentiary Terre Haute in Indiana.",
      "Most federal executions are carried out by lethal injection \u2014 until 2020, it was the sole method of execution. Methods were then expanded to include ones autho\u00adrized by the state in which the fed\u00ader\u00adal death sen\u00adtence was imposed. In some cases this could be by firing squad, such as the recent execution in South Carolina, or by\u00a0nitrogen gas, which was used in Alabama and Louisiana.",
      "Between the rein\u00adstate\u00adment of the fed\u00ader\u00adal death penal\u00adty in 1988 and 2024, 80 federal defen\u00addants were sen\u00adtenced to death and 16 were exe\u00adcut\u00aded.",
      "Under the first Trump administration, 13 people were executed over 6 months in 2020-2021, DPI confirmed to CBS News.",
      "Who is on federal death row?",
      "Fed\u00ader\u00adal death row pris\u00adon\u00aders from all over the coun\u00adtry are housed in the Special Confinement Unit at U.S. Penitentiary Terre Haute in Indiana.",
      "Many death row inmates die from old age, Lain said, and many are never executed. Cases can take at least a decade to wind through court and millions of dollars to judge, \"is this a life worth saving?\" said Lain, who said each death row case has two trials, one for the crime and the other for sentencing. In effect, criminals are being sentenced to \"life without parole with a random chance of execution,\" and the government is paying millions for the prosecution, she said.",
      "There are three prisoners currently on federal death row:\u00a0Roberts Bowers, who was convicted in 2023 for the mass shoot\u00ading at Tree of Life Synagogue;\u00a0Dylann Roof, who was convicted in 2017 for the fatal shoot\u00ading of nine parish\u00adioners in a Black church in Charleston, South Carolina; and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev\u00a0for the 2015 Boston Marathon bomb\u00ading.",
      "Then-U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland put a moratorium on federal executions in place shortly after taking office so that an internal DOJ review of execution policies and practices could take place, Maher said. That moratorium on executions was in place until the end of the Biden administration.",
      "Former President Joe Biden com\u00admut\u00aded the death sen\u00adtences of 37 out of 40 fed\u00ader\u00adal death row pris\u00adon\u00aders to sen\u00adtences of life without parole on Dec. 23, 2024, before he left office.",

      "Iran and the United States will hold more negotiations\u00a0next week over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program, Iranian state television reported Saturday at the end of the first round of talks between the two countries since President Trump returned to the White House.",
      "Iranian state TV also said U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi \"briefly spoke in the presence of the Omani foreign minister\" at the end of the talks, marking a direct interaction between the two nations locked in decades of tensions.",
      "The two sides spoke for over two hours at a location on the outskirts of Oman, ending the talks around 5:50 p.m. local time. The talks began at around 3:30 p.m. local.",
      "The White House said Witkoff was joined by U.S. Ambassador to Oman Ana Escrogima for the talks, which it described to be \"very positive and constructive.\"",
      "\"Special Envoy Witkoff underscored to Dr. Araghchi that he had instructions from President Trump to resolve our two nations' differences through dialogue and diplomacy, if that is possible,\" the White House said Saturday in a statement. \"These issues are very complicated, and Special Envoy Witkoff's direct communication today was a step forward in achieving a mutually beneficial outcome.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Saturday evening that the talks with Iran are \"going okay\" but declined to give further details.",
      "\"Nothing matters until you get it done,\" he said.",
      "The stakes of the negotiations couldn't be higher for the two nations\u00a0closing in on half a century of enmity. Trump repeatedly has threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran's nuclear program if a deal isn't reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.",
      "Talks took place Saturday afternoon in Oman",
      "AP journalists saw a convoy believed to be carrying Witkoff leave the Omani Foreign Ministry on Saturday afternoon and then speed off into the outskirts of Muscat. The convoy went into a compound and a few minutes later, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei wrote on the social platform X that the \"indirect talks\" had begun.",
      "\"These talks will be held at a location planned by the Omani host, with representatives of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United States seated in the halls and sides, conveying their points of view and positions to each other through the Omani Foreign Minister,\" Baghaei wrote.",
      "About an hour later, Baghaei appeared on Iranian state television and acknowledged the talks had been going on all that time.",
      "\"The objective of the Islamic Republic of Iran is very clear \u2014 we have only one goal, and that is to safeguard Iran's national interests,\" he said. \"We are giving a genuine and honest opportunity to diplomacy, so that through dialogue, we can move forward on the nuclear issue on one hand, and more importantly for us, the lifting of sanctions.\"",
      "Baghaei added: \"Look, this is just a beginning. So it is natural that, at this stage, both sides will present their foundational positions through the Omani mediator. Therefore, we do not expect this round of negotiations to be lengthy.\"",
      "Araghchi earlier spoke to Iranian journalists.",
      "\"If there is sufficient will on both sides, we will decide on a timetable. But it is still too early to talk about that,\" Araghchi said, in an audio clip published by IRNA. \"What is clear now is that the negotiations are indirect, and in our view only on the nuclear issue, and will be conducted with the necessary will to reach an agreement that is on an equal footing and leads to securing the national interests of the Iranian people.\"",
      "Trump and Witkoff both had described the talks as being \"direct.\"",
      "\"I think our position begins with dismantlement of your program. That is our position today,\" Witkoff told The Wall Street Journal before his trip. \"That doesn't mean, by the way, that at the margin we're not going to find other ways to find compromise between the two countries.\"",
      "He added: \"Where our red line will be, there can't be weaponization of your nuclear capability,\"",
      "Sanctions relief and enrichment remain top issues",
      "While the U.S. side can offer sanctions relief for Iran's beleaguered economy, it remains unclear just how much Iran will be willing to concede. Under the 2015 nuclear deal, Iran could only maintain a small stockpile of uranium enriched to 3.67%. Today, Tehran's stockpile could allow it to build multiple nuclear weapons if it so chooses and it has some material enriched up to 60%, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels. Judging from negotiations since Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the deal in 2018, Iran will likely ask to keep enriching uranium up to at least 20%.",
      "One thing it won't do is give up its program entirely. That makes the proposal of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of a so-called Libyan solution \u2014 \"you go in, blow up the facilities, dismantle all the equipment, under American supervision, American execution\" \u2014 unworkable.",

      "Abrego Garcia, who lives in Maryland with his\u00a0wife and children, was arrested and removed to El Salvador last month after Trump administration officials accused him of having ties to the MS-13 gang.

      "Sudan's notorious paramilitary group launched a two-day attack on famine-hit camps for displaced people that left more than 100 dead, including 20 children and nine aid workers, in the Darfur region, a U.N. official said Saturday.",
      "The Rapid Support Forces and allied militias launched an offensive on the Zamzam and Abu Shorouk camps and the nearby city of el-Fasher, the provincial capital of North Darfur province, on Friday, said U.N. Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan Clementine Nkweta-Salami.",
      "El-Fasher is under the control of the military, which has fought the RSF since Sudan descended into civil war two years ago, killing more than 24,000 people, according to the United Nations, though activists say the number is likely far higher.",
      "The camps were attacked again on Saturday, Nkweta-Salami said in a statement. She said that nine aid workers were killed \"while operating one of the very few remaining health posts still operational\" in Zamzam camp.",
      "\"This represents yet another deadly and unacceptable escalation in a series of brutal attacks on displaced people and aid workers in Sudan since the onset of this conflict nearly two years ago,\" she said.",
      "Nkweta-Salami didn't identify the aid workers but Sudan's Doctors' Union said in a statement that six medical workers with the Relief International were killed when their hospital in Zamzam came under attack on Friday. They include Dr. Mahmoud Babaker Idris, a physician at the hospital, and Adam Babaker Abdallah, head of the group in the region, the union said. It blamed the RSF for \"this criminal and barbaric act.\"",
      "In a statement Saturday evening, Relief International mourned the death of its nine workers, saying they were killed the previous day in a \"targeted attack on all health infrastructure in the region,\" including the group's clinic.",
      "The group said the central market in Zamzam along with hundreds of makeshift homes in the camp were destroyed in the attack.",
      "The offensive forced about 2,400 people to flee the camps and el-Fasher, according to the General Coordination for Displaced Persons and Refugees, a local group in Darfur.",
      "Zamzam and Abu Shouk shelter more than 700,000 people who have been forced to flee their homes across Darfur during past bouts of fighting in the region, Nkweta-Salami said.",
      "Late last month, the Sudanese military regained control over Khartoum, a major symbolic victory in the war. But the RSF still controls most of Darfur and some other areas.",
      "The two camps are among five areas in Sudan where famine was detected by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, IPC, a global hunger monitoring group.

    "published": "Fri, 11 Apr 2025 06:50:33 -0400",
    "summary": "Relatively little is known about Denisovans, an extinct group of human cousins that interacted with Neanderthals and Homo sapiens.",
    "story": [
      "An ancient jawbone discovered in Taiwan belonged to an enigmatic group of early human ancestors called Denisovans, scientists reported Thursday.",
      "Relatively little is known about Denisovans, an extinct group of human cousins that interacted with Neanderthals and our own species, Homo sapiens.",
      "\"Denisovan fossils are very scarce,\" with only a few confirmed finds in East Asia, said study co-author Takumi Tsutaya at the Graduate University for Advanced Studies in Japan.",
      "So far, the only known Denisovan fossils include partial jawbones, a few teeth and part of a finger bone found in caves in Siberia and Tibet. Some scientists believe fossils found in a cave in Laos may also belong to Denisovans.",
      "The probable identification of the jawbone from Taiwan as Denisovan expands the region where scientists know these ancient people once lived, said Tsutaya.",
      "\"Denisovans must therefore have been capable of adapting to a wide range of habitat types,\" study co-author Frido Welker told the Reuters news agency.",
      "The partial jawbone was first recovered when a fishing operation dredged the seafloor in the Penghu Channel near the Taiwan Strait. After it was sold to an antique shop, a collector spotted it and purchased it in 2008, then later donated it to Taiwan's National Museum of Natural Science.",
      "Based on the composition of marine invertebrates found attached to it, the fossil was dated to the Pleistocene era. But exactly which species of early human ancestor it belonged to remained a mystery.",
      "The condition of the fossil made it impossible to study ancient DNA. But recently, scientists in Taiwan, Japan and Denmark were able to extract some protein sequences from the incomplete jawbone.",
      "An analysis showed some protein sequences resembled those contained in the genome of a Denisovan fossil recovered in Siberia. The findings were published in the journal Science.",
      "While the new research is promising, Rick Potts, director of the Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Project, said he would like to see further data before confirming the Taiwan fossil as Denisovan.",
      "Potts, who was not involved in the new research, praised the study for \"a fantastic job of recovering some proteins.\" But he added, such a small sliver of material may not give a full picture.",
      "At one time, at least three human ancestor groups - Denisovans, Neanderthals and Homo sapiens - coexisted in Eurasia and sometimes interbred, researchers say.",
      "\"We can identity Neanderthal elements and Denisovan elements\" in the DNA of some people alive today, said Tsutaya.",
      "Scientists still don't know exactly why Denisovans went extinct.",
      "\"We have so little archaeological and fossil information about Denisovans that we can only speculate as to why they disappeared,\" Welker told Reuters. \"A lasting legacy, though, is that some human populations in East and Southeast Asia carry some Denisovan ancestry in their genomes today.\"",

    "summary": "U.S. and Russian intelligence agencies negotiated an agreement to free American Ksenia Karelina in exchange for a Russian detainee.",
    "story": [
      "Russia released Ksenia Karelina, a dual U.S.-Russian national who was sentenced to 12 years in prison for treason in August last year, in a new prison swap on Thursday. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed her release in a social media post early Thursday, but offered no information about the terms of her release.",
      "The Wall Street Journal first reported\u00a0Karelina's release, saying she was freed in a swap arranged by the two countries' intelligence agencies, and a CIA official later told CBS News that the agency had played a central role in the deal on behalf of the U.S. government.",
      "\"American Ksenia Karelina is on a plane back home to the United States,\" Rubio said in his post. \"She was wrongfully detained by Russia for over a year and President Trump secured her release.\"",
      "The plane landed around 11 p.m. EDT at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, where she was greeted by several people including her boyfriend, professional boxer Chris van Heerden. In a touching moment, Karelina and van Heerden had a long embrace.",
      "In a statement first published by the Journal and later provided to CBS News, CIA Director John Ratcliffe said, \"President Trump brought home another wrongfully detained American from Russia,\" and added his praise for \"the CIA officers who worked tirelessly to support this effort\" and for the United Arab Emirate of Abu Dhabi, which he said had enabled the exchange. The swap of the two detainees was carried out in Abu Dhabi.",
      "Ratcliffe was directly involved in the negotiations, which he conducted with an unnamed senior Russian intelligence official, the CIA said.",
      "The top level communication indicates a deepening of efforts by the Trump administration to improve ties with Moscow. Mr. Trump has been pushing both Russia and Ukraine to negotiate a peace agreement to end the three-year war sparked by Russia's ongoing full-scale invasion of its neighbor.",
      "In exchange for Karelina, who lives in California, the CIA official confirmed that the U.S. had freed Arthur Petrov, a German-Russian national arrested in Cyprus 2023 at the request of U.S. authorities. According to the Journal, he was being held on allegations of exporting sensitive microelectronics.",
      "\"Much of the swap was negotiated by the U.S. government, with CIA playing a key role engaging with Russian intelligence,\" a CIA spokesperson said Thursday, adding, \"The exchange shows the importance of keeping lines of communication open with Russia, despite the deep challenges in our bilateral relationship.\"",
      "Karelina was sentenced to 12 years in a Russian penal colony after pleading guilty to treason. She was arrested while on visit to Russia for donating about $51 to an American-based humanitarian group that was helping Ukrainians impacted by the war, according to Russian state media.",
      "Her lawyers said she acknowledged transferring the funds, though she did not admit she intentionally directed them to organizations that might have used the money for actions against Russia. She didn't expect that her donation would end up supporting anti-Russian activities, according to her lawyers.",
      "Van Heerden\u00a0told CBS News last year that she had made the small donation in 2022, \"exercising her First Amendment rights,\" adding that \"she has done nothing wrong.\"",
      "Van Heerden said he was uneasy about Karelina's decision to return to Russia for a visit, given the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, but he said she \"had no worry in the world,\" and that she had assured him it would be safe since she was entering the country as a dual American-Russian citizen.",
      "\"She wanted to go home. She made it very clear that she wanted to go home,\" Van Heerden told Gayle King on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Wanting to fulfill her wish to visit home, Van Heerden said he bought her a plane ticket as a birthday gift, and the pair first traveled together to Istanbul. He had originally intended to travel with her to Russia from there, but he didn't feel comfortable, so she traveled alone to Russia, and he returned to Los Angeles.",
      "Russia imprisoned a number of Americans as tension with Washington soared amid the build up to, and eventually the full-scale war in Ukraine. Paul Whelan, Wall Street Journal reporter\u00a0Evan Gershkovich\u00a0and teacher\u00a0Marc Fogel\u00a0were all designated wrongfully detained like Karelina and freed in previous prisoner swaps with Moscow.",
      "Among the U.S. nationals still jailed in Russia is U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Gordon Black, whose three-year, nine-month prison sentence for robbing and threatening his Russian girlfriend was reduced earlier this week by seven months by a Russian court.",
      "Robert Gilman, 72, is currently serving a 3 1/2-year sentence in Russia for assaulting a police officer, and\u00a0Travis Leake, a musician convicted on drug charges, was sentenced to 13 years in prison last summer.",
      "A Russian court\u00a0sentenced another 72-year-old American, Stephen Hubbard, to nearly seven years in prison in October for fighting alongside Ukraine's military.",

Vice President JD Vance also admonished Zelensky: \"Have you said 'thank you' once, this entire meeting?\"",

      "He said that the movie educates children \"on two levels: You're teaching them not only about the faith that you adhere to, but you're weaving in this incredible, iconic novelist that you're introducing them to on some level, and it just becomes a frame of reference for families.\"",

    "story": [
      "The country music couple posed Monday in front of Trisha Yearwood's Hollywood star.",
      "In 2014, when Garth Brooks made the decision to return to country music after leaving the industry for 14 years to raise his children, he found a remarkably different world than the one he'd known.",
      "The singer-songwriter announced his retirement in 2000 when he was at the top of his game, having released mega-hits like \"Friends in Low Places\" and \"The River\" during the '90s. After several years out of the spotlight spent taking care of his three daughters in his home state of Oklahoma, Brooks moved to Nashville after his youngest child made the decision to attend Belmont University in the city.",
      "When he arrived, he found that Music City had turned into a \"gutted town.\"",
      "GARTH BROOKS GAVE UP BEING \u2018BIGGEST SUPERSTAR ON PLANET\u2019 TO RAISE KIDS IN OKLAHOMA",
      "Garth Brooks performs at the ASCAP Centennial Awards at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City on Nov. 17, 2014. (Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for ASCAP)",
      "As Brooks wrote in his new book, \"The Anthology Part V,\" after he and his wife, fellow country superstar Trisha Yearwood, made the move back to Nashville, \"I saw that we'd lost over 80 percent of our songwriters. They were gone.\"",
      "He continued, \"It was a gutted town when it came to songwriters. And, I'm sorry, try and feed the world without farmers. The songwriters? They're the farmers that feed music, and they were gone. So you kind of said, okay, you're getting back into this thing. But there's a lot I am not happy about that's happened in the last fourteen years. \u2026 It created a mood. Things got darker.\"",
      "\"As much as I love songwriting, and as much as I love the publishers that independently push their songs, what's happened to the songwriter is technology.\"",
      "Brooks touched on the same topic again in another portion of the book, once again saying that Nashville had been \"gutted\" when he returned from Oklahoma. He wrote that he'd seen before \"how songwriters made a living and how dreams come true,\" but in 2014, all he could see \"was all we had lost.\"",
      "Garth Brooks performs for the Parade of Pennies in Nashville, Tennessee, on Jan. 1, 1989. (Beth Gwinn/Getty Images)",
      "Later in the book, when discussing his comeback album and its title track, \"Man Against Machine,\" Brooks explained more about what had changed in the 14 years he'd been gone: technology.",
      "\"As much as I love songwriting, and as much as I love the publishers that independently push their songs, what's happened to the songwriter is technology,\" the singer-songwriter explained. \"For fourteen years I watched from the sidelines as music fell a victim to technology.\"",
      "\"The iPod comes out, which leads to the smartphone. And music made the mistake of backing down to technology, because the threat that technology made to music was this: \u2018If you\u2019re not going to play our game, then all the iPods and smartphones will be filled with illegally downloaded stuff. And there's nothing we can do about that.'\"",
      "He added, \"Music blinked, and bam!, they let technology price their product. And all I can say is, can you believe \u2018Hotel California\u2019 is worth only 99 cents? \u2026 We understood that technology was taking over music, would eventually choke and damn near kill music while the technology prospered.\"",

      "Brooks struggled with navigating the change in the music industry as he also dealt with all the changes in his personal life \u2014 the move from Oklahoma to Tennessee and his last child leaving home (he admitted that \"the empty nest hit me a lot harder than I ever dreamed it would\") \u2014 but he said that the idea of streaming music \"might have been the hardest to get my head around.\"",
      "Coming from a time when fans had to buy physical copies of albums and singles and entering into a new era when so much was focused on digital products was something that he admitted he \"wasn't seeing a way through.\"",
      "To combat the issues he saw with digital music, Brooks launched GhostTunes in September 2014, his own digital music store, with the intent of giving a greater portion of money from the sales of the music to songwriters and artists. In 2017, GhostTunes was absorbed into Amazon Music, but as he wrote in \"The Anthology Part V,\" he doesn't consider it a failed business venture.",
      "Garth Brooks talks to the media during his World Tour Press Conference at Allstate Arena in Rosemont, Illinois, on Sept. 4, 2014. (David Banks/Getty Images)",
      "\"Anybody that calls GhostTunes a mistake can't see the writing on the wall, that technology is f---ing music over. The genie is so far out of the bottle at this point. I never want to offend anyone. With that said, my opinion is technology has no love for art. None whatsoever. It just has a love for something that can sell its hardware and software,\" he explained.",

      "Also in September 2014, Brooks kicked off The Garth Brooks World Tour \u2014 his first since his previous world tour wrapped in 1998. He recalled being \"scared s---less that no one would show up\" when he first announced new concerts, and when a ticket queue was set up for the first show, which took place in Chicago, he told his team that he'd be happy to see 100,000 people waiting online to buy tickets.",

      "Brooks added shows to meet the demand, eventually performing 11 concerts in Chicago alone. As for the decision to kick off the tour in the city, Marci Braun, a program director for US99, a Chicago radio station that helped promote the tour, explained, \"Put Garth's first comeback show in Nashville, and it's a country story. Put it in Oklahoma, it's a Garth story. Put it in Chicago? It's an American story.\"",
      "In the end, the comeback tour went on for three years, concluding with seven Nashville shows in December 2017. Randy Bernard, one of Brooks' managers, said, \"Garth came back bigger than when he left. It made a difference for country music as a whole, just like what he did in the '90s made a difference. \u2026 There was no one in the world doing the numbers he was doing.\"",

      "In 2016, Brooks won the Country Music Association's Entertainer of the Year award \u2014 something he'd won four times before in the '90s, but that he pushed for in 2016 for the sake of his band and crew, who he said \"were doing something nobody had done before. They were killing it. I mean killing it. Three-hundred-ninenty-one shows in something like seventy-two cities. It was absolutely nuts.\"",
      "Brooks won the award again in 2017 and 2019. In 2020, he announced that he no longer wanted to be considered for the honor.",
      "Garth Brooks won the Country Music Association's Entertainer of the Year award a record-setting seven times before removing himself from consideration for the award permanently. (Getty Images)",
      "Brooks believes that, being an entertainer, the work he and his team did during that lengthy comeback tour is what ultimately made his return to music such a big success story.",
      "\"The one thing that no one can take away, that nobody rules but you, is live,\" he shared. \"The live show, that's when it's just you and the people that determine whether your stuff is a success or a failure. \u2026 It's about passion. It's all on the line every time. You're just going straight to the people.\"",
      "Brooks continued: \"Live music was there before radio, before records, probably goes back further than any of us might even believe. One person throwing down a melody and rhythm for another: I'm guessing that if there was love \u2014 and surely if there was sex! \u2014 there had to have been music. Something like the age of streaming will never be powerful enough to take that away. Live music will win every time. When I think about this, really think about it, I stop worrying about the future of the music business.\"",

    "story": [
      "Fox News correspondent William La Jeunesse joins 'Fox News Sunday' to discuss the evolution of AI and the push lawmakers are making to regulate it.",
      "The use of artifical intelligence to reimagine the classic film \"The Wizard of Oz\" will likely see mixed reactions from fans, experts told Fox News Digital.",
      "While \"film purists\" may resist the idea of using generative AI to give classic films an entire makeover, the technology could \"breathe new life\" into hit movies \u2014 including \"The Wizard of Oz.\"",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery, Google Cloud and Magnopus have set out to do just that by creating an immersive experience for fans of the 1939 classic. The new \"Wizard of Oz\" experience is set to premiere at the Las Vegas Sphere on Aug. 28.",
      "\"The fan reaction will likely split into two distinct camps,\" Michael Walker, CEO of AI-First at Trilogy, told Fox News Digital. \"Film purists will object \u2014 and they have valid concerns about artistic integrity. The original work represents specific creative choices by directors, cinematographers and set designers who worked within the constraints of their era. Expanding and reimagining with AI creates something fundamentally different from their vision.\"",

      "\"On the other hand, this represents an exciting new way to connect classic films with audiences who increasingly expect immersive experiences,\" he explained. \"The technology could breathe new life into works that might otherwise fade from cultural relevance.\"",

      "The LED screen at Las Vegas Sphere wraps over and behind the audience \u2014 creating a problem when trying to transform the original film of the classic feature.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "\"Using versions of Veo, Imagen and Gemini specially tuned for the task, the Google teams and their partners developed an AI-based \u2018super resolution\u2019 tool to turn those tiny celluloid frames from 1939 into ultra-ultra-high definition imagery that will pop inside Sphere,\" according to a Google blog explaining the technology. \"Then, the teams perform AI outpainting, to expand the scope of scenes to both fill the space and fill in the gaps created by camera cuts and framing limitations. Finally, through performance generation, they\u2019re incorporating composites of those famed performances into the expanded environments. Together, these techniques help achieve the natural gestures, staging and fine details that conventional CGI struggles to match.\"",
      "Jim Dolan, executive chairman and CEO of Sphere Entertainment, said: \"When you have innovation like this, you don't always know where it's going to go. You have to be able to take a leap of faith. What you're going to see in \u2018The Wizard of Oz at Sphere\u2019 is clearly a leap of faith.\"",

      "\"The Wizard of Oz at Sphere\" is set to premiere on Aug. 28. (Moviestore/Shutterstock)",
      "Fans' reactions to this leap of faith will \"span the spectrum,\" Boon Chew, founder of CentaurLab.AI, told Fox News Digital: \"Some will be excited, others resistant. Predicting the majority reaction is tough, and in any case, popular opinion doesn\u2019t determine whether something is right or meaningful. Innovation isn't a democracy \u2014 it\u2019s a process of exploration.\"",
      "\"What truly matters is the outcome,\" Chew explained. \"If a reimagined classic resonates, its value will speak for itself. Dismissing it without seeing the result is less about merit and more about discomfort with change. A classic doesn\u2019t stop being a classic because it\u2019s expressed in a new way. In fact, the heart of a classic is its ability to endure, evolve, and inspire across generations. Some may say reimagining beloved films with AI is gimmicky or disrespectful. My take? Don\u2019t engage with the remake if it\u2019s not your thing \u2014 but let others explore and create. The only real line we shouldn\u2019t cross is legal or ethical: copyright, attribution and transparency.\"",
      "He continued: \"From an evolutionary standpoint, nothing should be frozen in time. Reimagining classics with generative AI opens up new doors \u2014 for education, storytelling and accessibility.\"",

      "LOW-CARB KETO DIET MAY NOT RAISE HEART DISEASE RISK, NEW STUDY SUGGESTS",
      "This new research confirmed earlier findings showing that the experimental drug \u2014 lepodisiran, made by Eli Lilly, who funded the study \u2014 can \"silence\" the main gene responsible for synthesizing Lp(a).",

      "What to know about Lp(a)",
      "Lipoprotein(a) levels are elevated in approximately 20-25% of people worldwide, according to the American Heart Association.",
      "This equates to approximately 64 million people in the U.S. and 1.4 billion people globally.",

      "\"Lipoprotein(a) is an independent risk factor for heart disease that is largely determined by genetics \u2014 that is, it is inherited,\" added Dr. Deepak L.

      "Lipoprotein(a) levels are elevated in approximately 20-25% of people worldwide, according to the American Heart Association.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "Lp(a) is primarily determined by differences in one gene, while LDL cholesterol levels are influenced by multiple genes.",
      "\"That's a very big difference, and LDL has a much larger environmental component,\" Nissen noted.",
      "\"Lp(a) is an independent risk factor for heart disease that is largely determined by genetics.\"",
      "Diet, exercise and weight loss can help decrease LDL levels, but they do not have an impact on Lp(a) levels, experts say.",

      "\"There is no approved pharmacotherapy for lipoprotein(a) by regulatory authorities in any country in the world,\" Nissen confirmed.",
      "Study design",
      "The researchers performed a clinical trial of 320 individuals from Argentina, China, Denmark, Germany, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain and the U.S. from Nov. 11, 2022, to April 17, 2023.",
      "The participants were randomly assigned to receive either a placebo or one or two subcutaneous injections of lepodisiran.",
      "Diet, exercise and weight loss can help decrease LDL levels, but they do not have an impact on Lp(a) levels, experts say. (iStock)",
      "The normal level of Lp(a) is less than 75 nanomoles per liter and the average level for people in the trial was about 250 nanomoles per liter, Nissen told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"They were very high \u2014 more than three times the upper limit of normal,\" he added.",
      "WHEN MEASURING HEART ATTACK RISK, ONE IMPORTANT RED FLAG IS OFTEN OVERLOOKED, DOCTORS SAY",
      "After one injection of the highest dose, participants showed a nearly 100% reduction in levels of lipoprotein(a) at six months.",
      "Those who received a second dose at six months maintained an almost 100% reduction at the one-year mark.",
      "In other words, the therapy removed virtually all lipoprotein(a) from the blood, according to Nissen.",
      "Unlike traditional cholesterol, which doctors typically monitor over time, lipoprotein(a) only needs to be checked once in a lifetime. (iStock)",
      "Cardiologists say these findings may ultimately help treat millions of Americans who have elevated levels of Lp(a).",
      "\"The results are very impressive,\" Bhatt said.",
      "Potential limitations",
      "The researchers noted that there were no major safety concerns, but 12% of participants reported mild reactions at the injection site.",
      "The study had only a few Black participants \u2014 a population that needs more research, as they are more likely to have elevated lipoprotein(a) concentrations than White persons, according to previous studies.",
      "(To address this concern, the researchers are enrolling many more Black patients in their larger phase 3 clinical trial.)",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Another limitation was that only two doses of lepodisiran were administered in the trial, so the effect of more doses is not known.",
      "The study also did not show that reducing Lp(a) levels also reduces the risk of heart attacks and strokes, outside experts noted.",
      "The European Society of Cardiology and the National Lipid Association in the U.S. both recommend that all adults check their Lp(a) levels. (iStock)",

      "All three of the recent California cases have been fatal, which Dr. Tom Boo, Mono County\u2019s public health officer described as \"tragic and alarming.\"",
      "\"We don\u2019t have a clear sense of where this young adult may have contracted the virus,\" Boo said in a press release.",
      "\"An increase in indoor mice elevates the risk of hantavirus exposure.\"",
      "One person had \"numerous mice\" in their home, but no evidence of mice was found in the other two homes, the release stated.",
      "\"The occurrence of three cases in a short period has me worried, especially this early in the year,\" Boo said.",

      "The most common\u00a0type of rodent to carry it in the U.S. is the deer mouse, the doctor confirmed.",
      "Most hantavirus cases are seen in rural areas, where it is more likely for rodents to get into homes or barns, the CDC noted.",
      "Siegel added that it rarely affects humans \"because only some of the rodents have it, and they don't all come into contact \u2014 but one-third to one-half of cases are fatal.\"",
      "Symptoms and treatment",
      "Early symptoms of hantavirus include fever, muscle aches, fatigue and\u00a0gastrointestinal issues that appear anywhere from one to eight weeks after exposure, according to Parry.",
      "\"These progress to serious respiratory symptoms like coughing, shortness of breath and fluid in the lungs four to 10 days later,\" he said.",
      "Hantavirus is an RNA virus that can be transmitted to humans through rodent droppings, causing severe illness. (iStock)",
      "Sin Nombre virus is the most common hantavirus in the United States, which causes hantavirus pulmonary syndrome with a mortality rate of approximately 38%.",

      "Early symptoms of hantavirus include fever, muscle aches, fatigue and\u00a0gastrointestinal issues that appear anywhere from one to eight weeks after exposure. (iStock)",
      "\"If a patient is experiencing full distress, it is less likely the treatment will be effective.\"",
      "Supportive care can include monitoring\u00a0heart function, administering fluids and oxygen, and placing the patient on a ventilator as needed. Patients may also receive broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, fever reducers and\u00a0pain relievers.",
      "\"Early intensive medical care is critical, because patients who have sudden acute disease can rapidly become severely sick and die.\"",
      "\"Although there is no cure for hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, it is important to seek medical care when short of breath, because the patient may need support from a mechanical ventilator or extra-corporal membrane oxygenator (ECMO) machine to deliver enough oxygen to their body,\" Dr. Sonja Bartolome, an expert in pulmonology and critical care at UT Southwestern Medical Center, previously told Fox News Digital.",

      "What is Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) bypass?",
      "Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) is a security feature in Windows that enforces strict rules about which applications can run. It helps block unauthorized software, but researchers have found ways to bypass these protections.",
      "Bobby Cooke, a red team operator at IBM X-Force Red,\u00a0confirmed that Microsoft Teams could be used as a WDAC bypass. He explained that during Red Team Operations, they were able to get around WDAC and execute their Stage 2 Command and Control payload.",

      "DOUBLECLICKJACKING HACK TURNS DOUBLE-CLICKS INTO ACCOUNT TAKEOVERS",
      "How hackers bypass Windows Defender Application Control",
      "One of the key ways attackers get around WDAC is by using Living-off-the-Land Binaries, or LOLBins. These are legitimate system tools that come pre-installed with Windows, but hackers can repurpose them to execute unauthorized code while avoiding security detection. Since these tools are trusted by the system, they provide an easy way to slip past defenses.",
      "Some bypass techniques involve DLL sideloading, where attackers trick legitimate applications into loading malicious DLLs instead of the intended ones. Additionally, if WDAC policies are not enforced properly, attackers can modify execution rules to allow unauthorized software to run.",
      "Hackers also use unsigned or loosely signed binaries. WDAC relies on code signing to verify an application\u2019s authenticity. However, attackers sometimes exploit misconfigurations where loosely signed or unsigned binaries are mistakenly allowed, letting them execute malicious payloads.",
      "Once an attacker bypasses WDAC, they can execute payloads without being flagged by traditional security solutions. This means they can deploy ransomware, install backdoors, or move laterally within a network without triggering immediate suspicion. Since many of these attacks use built-in Windows tools, detecting malicious activity becomes even more difficult.",

      "1. Keep Windows updated:\u00a0Microsoft regularly releases security updates that patch vulnerabilities, including those related to WDAC. Keeping Windows and Microsoft Defender up to date ensures you have the latest protection against known threats. If you\u2019re not sure how to do that, see my\u00a0guide on how to keep all your devices and apps updated.",
      "2. Be cautious with software downloads:\u00a0Only install applications from trusted sources like the Microsoft Store or official vendor websites. Avoid pirated software, as it can come bundled with malicious code that bypasses security protections like WDAC.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software: Based on the report, it does not appear that hackers require user interaction to bypass WDAC. The methods described suggest that an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities without direct user input, especially if they already have some level of access to the system.",
      "However, in real-world scenarios, attackers often combine such exploits with social engineering or phishing to gain initial access. For example, if an attacker gains access through a phishing attack, they might then use WDAC bypass methods to execute further malicious payloads.",
      "So, while direct user input may not be necessary for some bypass techniques, attackers often use user actions as an entry point before exploiting WDAC vulnerabilities. The best way to avoid becoming a victim is to have a strong antivirus software installed.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

We can therefore not only localize the seizure onset but provide a surgical treatment and potentially avoid a second and potentially more extensive or invasive procedure such as a craniotomy and resection of brain tissue.",
      "\"The NeuroOne electrodes allow us to control the conditions of the ablative procedure.

      "\"Regarding the implantation itself, she did very well and there were no adverse effects. The first ablation did not cause any acute complications. We then performed a second ablation a few days later after data was recorded from the electrodes demonstrating ongoing seizure activity to ensure that her seizures would not recur. This was also well-tolerated without complications. We have now followed up months after the electrodes were removed and there have been no signs of ill effects due to the implantation or the ablations. She has been seizure-free since the ablation and has done amazingly well.\"",
      "Clara\u2019s story offers hope for others living with drug-resistant epilepsy, which affects about one-third of the 3 million Americans with epilepsy. According to Rosa, \"The desire to expand ablation therapy to patients suffering from seizures that do not respond to drug therapy was our driving force.\"",

      "A broader impact on medicine",
      "NeuroOne\u2019s innovative technology isn\u2019t just limited to epilepsy treatment. The company plans to expand its applications to other areas, such as pain management for facial pain and lower back pain, using the same RF ablation technology. Rosa also sees potential for treating neurological conditions beyond epilepsy:\u00a0\"Pain management appears to be the largest opportunity outside of brain ablation.\"",
      "Dr. Freund believes this technology could dramatically improve long-term care for pediatric epilepsy patients like Clara:",
      "\"This technology could allow for limiting the number of procedures that are required to treat drug-resistant focal epilepsy and also provide immediate feedback as to whether or not a surgical treatment was effective. This could potentially reduce the risk of adverse events by limiting the number of times that a brain surgery would be needed. This technology also allows us to access deeper parts of the brain to provide surgical treatment.\"",
      "He added that the impact may soon be widespread:",
      "\"In our practice, we are now using these electrodes in every case that requires Stereo EEG for treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. I think as these types of electrodes are used at more centers and they get more experience, there would be no reason not to use them.\"",

      "Imagine receiving a notification about suspicious charges on a credit card you haven\u2019t even received yet. How could that happen?",
      "While it sounds surprising and unsettling, it's increasingly common due to the rise of digital credit card fraud. Criminals no longer need physical cards to make unauthorized transactions, thanks to methods such as data breaches, phishing schemes and card-not-present fraud.",
      "Here's how these schemes work and what steps you should take immediately to protect yourself.",
      "STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS \u2013 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S \u2018THE CYBERGUY REPORT\u2019 NOW",
      "Illustration of a crook stealing credit card info (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How it happens",
      "Even if a new credit card hasn\u2019t arrived yet, it may already be vulnerable. In many cases, the issue isn\u2019t about the card being physically stolen but about someone gaining access to your information digitally. Criminals can exploit online account features, mobile wallets or leaked personal data to start using your card before you\u2019ve even opened the envelope. Below are some of the most common ways this type of fraud happens.",
      "If a scammer already has access to your account, either through stolen login credentials, a hacked email or\u00a0malware, they can view the newly issued card number in the online dashboard or mobile app. Many credit card companies now allow instant access to digital card numbers for use in Apple Pay, Google Wallet or online purchases. This means that as soon as a new card is issued, it may be visible digitally before the physical card is even shipped. If a fraudster has access to your account, they can add the number to a digital wallet and begin spending before the envelope ever hits your mailbox.",
      "Some card issuers allow you to add your credit card to mobile wallets instantly, even before the physical card arrives. While this feature is convenient, it can also expose you to specific security risks tied to mobile wallet activation. Criminals may exploit this process by using stolen personal information to bypass security checks and add your card to their own Apple Pay or Google Wallet accounts. They might pose as you to request a new card, intercept or reroute the digital activation process, or even start making fraudulent purchases immediately. This type of fraud can be hard to detect, especially if you're not expecting a new card or if unauthorized charges blend in with legitimate transactions.",
      "Illustration of someone using their digital wallet (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "THIS IS HOW TO PROTECT YOUR CREDIT AND BANK CARDS FROM GETTING HACKED",
      "Another common scenario involves your personal information being compromised in a\u00a0phishing attack or large-scale\u00a0data breach. Thieves use this stolen data, such as your name, Social Security number, address and security question answers, to impersonate you and gain access to your account dashboard or reset login credentials. Once inside, they can retrieve new card details directly from the source or request a replacement card. Phishing scams often trick victims into revealing sensitive information through fake emails or websites, while data breaches expose vast amounts of personal data that criminals can exploit for fraudulent activities.",
      "Although charges made before a new credit card is received are rarely due to mail theft, this type of traditional fraud still poses a risk. Criminals may intercept your mail to steal sensitive documents, including credit cards, which can then be used for unauthorized purchases. To reduce this risk, avoid leaving important mail unattended in your mailbox. Consider using\u00a0Informed Delivery by USPS to track incoming mail or request that your credit card be delivered to a secure location, such as a P.O. box or directly to your bank branch.",

Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "2. Use strong antivirus software: If spyware or a keylogger has been installed on your device, it can continue to steal sensitive data, such as passwords and personal information, even after you change your credentials. To protect yourself, install strong antivirus software on all your devices.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Enable multifactor authentication (MFA): Add\u00a0MFA to all accounts tied to your financial information. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second verification step (e.g., a code sent to your phone) before accessing sensitive accounts.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4.\u00a0Use an identity theft protection service:\u00a0Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "5. Invest in personal data removal services: Consider using a personal data removal service to reduce your online exposure. These services continuously monitor and remove your sensitive information from data brokers and websites that could be exploited by criminals. This lowers the chances of your data being used in phishing scams or other fraudulent activities. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6. Ask your credit card company to investigate:\u00a0Contact your credit card provider directly and request a full investigation. Ask if there was any suspicious account activity, such as a login from a new device, before the fraudulent charges occurred. They may be able to trace when and how your account was accessed. Most card issuers will reverse fraudulent charges and can reissue a new card with a different number.",
      "7. Notify law enforcement:\u00a0File a report with the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission. If necessary, a police report should also be filed to document the fraud. This can be helpful for disputing charges and clearing your record.",
      "DON\u2019T LET THIS CREDIT CARD FRAUD NIGHTMARE HAPPEN TO YOU",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "So, we've uncovered how those sneaky credit card charges can surface even before you've held the card in your hands. It's a reflection of the increasingly digital world we live in, where our personal information can be vulnerable in surprising ways. Remember, use strong antivirus software and consider a personal data removal service to minimize your online footprint. If you find yourself in this situation, act fast by changing your passwords, enabling multifactor authentication and reporting the issue to your card company.",

      "What you need to know",
      "The X data leak is believed to stem from a combination of breaches, including a massive one that allegedly occurred in January 2025 and another in 2023. The leaked dataset, reportedly a 34 GB CSV file, contains 201,186,753 entries with information such as X screen names, user IDs, full names, locations, email addresses (from the 2023 breach), follower counts, profile data, time zones and profile images.",

      "If you have an account on X or think your data may have been part of the breach, here are seven important steps you can take to protect yourself.",
      "1) Use strong antivirus software",
      "This breach included email addresses linked to X accounts, prime fuel for phishing attacks. Hackers may now send emails that look like they\u2019re from X, Musk or support, asking you to \"verify your account\" or \"reset your password.\" These often contain links or attachments that can install malware or steal personal data.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Remove your personal data from the internet",
      "Since this X leak exposed full names, email addresses and other public-facing profile details, hackers can easily cross-reference it with other data broker sites to build a full profile on you. This could lead to impersonation or spear-phishing.",
      "To reduce your exposure, use a trusted data removal service that scans data broker websites and requests the deletion of your personal information. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3) Change your X account password",
      "Even though this particular breach may not have included passwords, there\u2019s still a significant risk, especially if you use the same password across multiple platforms. Once attackers have your email, they often try using it with common or previously leaked passwords to break into accounts.",
      "To change your X account password, go to Settings and privacy from your profile menu, then select\u00a0Your account and tap on\u00a0Change your password. Enter your current password, set a new strong password and confirm the change. You can do this via the mobile app or by logging in through the web. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "4) Make your X profile more private to reduce future risk",
      "Adjust your X account's privacy settings to limit the visibility of personal information, such as making your profile private. Ensure that only necessary information is publicly visible. Information that seems harmless, like your location, job title or birthday, can be used by cybercriminals to impersonate you or guess your login credentials. If your X profile includes any personal details that aren\u2019t necessary, now is the time to remove them.",
      "Keeping your profile minimal not only protects your privacy but also makes it harder for scammers to craft convincing phishing messages or social engineering attacks. Think twice before posting personal updates or details publicly, especially if they can be used to guess passwords or verify your identity.",
      "Go to\u00a0Settings > Privacy and safety and lock down your account visibility.",
      "5) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for your X and email accounts",
      "If hackers got your email from the X breach, they may try to reset your password.\u00a02FA helps stop this by requiring a second code to log in:",
      "Use an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy, not SMS, which can be interceptedSecure your email accounts, too, since they can be used to reset your X credentials",
      "Use an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy, not SMS, which can be intercepted",
      "Secure your email accounts, too, since they can be used to reset your X credentials",
      "6) Use a VPN on public Wi-Fi",
      "Protect your data when accessing X or other platforms on public networks by using a VPN to encrypt your connection. This will help safeguard your information from being intercepted by malicious actors. A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "7) Sign up for identity theft protection to catch if your X-linked info is abused",
      "With 200-plus million names and email addresses exposed, scammers may try opening accounts in your name or use your email in fraud attempts. Good identity protection can alert you if your info is being sold on the dark web. It can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my\u00a0tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "NEW PHISHING SCAM OUTSMARTS SECURITY CODES TO STEAL YOUR INFO",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The X breach is yet another reminder that patching a vulnerability is only one piece of a much larger puzzle. The persistence of leaked data \u2013 years after the original flaw was disclosed and fixed \u2013 highlights the long tail of exposure that comes with large-scale breaches. Even when credentials aren\u2019t involved, the combination of identifiers like email addresses, names and social connections can be weaponized through correlation attacks, data enrichment and AI-assisted social engineering.",

      "SafetyCore is an interesting addition to Android, offering on-device content filtering with machine learning. While it aims to enhance privacy and security, some users might have questions about its presence and functionality.

      "\"The Pentagon was saying if aviators are flying, and they identify something that they can't readily say what this is, then [officials] should, as a matter of national security, make sure that they catalog it and figure out what it was,\" Baker told Fox News Digital. \"There's a reason why you have a method of investigating these things.

    "summary": "An Israeli official says military operations and hostage talks are fully coordinated with the U.S., as officials remain optimistic about a deal. Israel continues its advance in Gaza.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meet at the White House amid reciprocal tariffs uproar, and the president addresses a wide range of questions.",
      "Nearly a month into Israel\u2019s renewed ground operation, U.S. backing appears to be shaping the conflict on multiple levels\u2014militarily, diplomatically and politically. Israeli officials have suggested the chances of a hostage deal have significantly increased, with some anticipating developments within the next two weeks.",
      "On Monday, sitting beside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office, President Donald Trump told reporters, \"We are trying very hard to get the hostages out. We're looking at another ceasefire. We'll see what happens.\" The remarks highlighted Trump\u2019s dual-track approach: continued diplomatic pressure on Iran and direct support for Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza.",
      "With what Israeli officials describe as a \"free hand\" to operate, Israel has expanded its offensive into Rafah and the strategically significant Morag Corridor. The stated aim is to increase pressure on Hamas and help secure the release of the remaining 59 hostages.",
      "ISRAEL LAUNCHES NEW GROUND OPERATION IN GAZA",
      "A senior Israeli security official told Fox News Digital that the campaign is being carried out in close coordination with the United States. \"Everything is coordinated with the Americans \u2014 both the negotiations and the operational activity. The goal is to bring the hostages home. We now have a free hand to act, and no longer facing the threat of a veto at the UN Security Council, unlike during the previous administration.\"",
      "The same official pointed to a shift in humanitarian policy that, in their view, has enhanced Israeli leverage. \"Unlike the previous administration, the U.S. is not forcing 350 aid trucks into Gaza every day. That gives us leverage,\" the official said, adding that limiting aid reduces Hamas\u2019s ability to control the population.",
      "On Saturday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz announced the IDF had completed the takeover of the Morag Axis. The Morag Corridor \u2014 which separates Rafah from Khan Younis \u2014 is part of an effort to establish a new buffer zone and degrade Hamas\u2019s operational capabilities. \"The logic is that the more territory Hamas loses, the more likely it will be to compromise on a hostage deal,\" the official said.",
      "IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir reinforced that strategy during a visit to front-line units this week. \"I expect you to defeat the Rafah Brigade and lead to victory wherever you are fighting,\" he told troops. The IDF had previously declared the Rafah Brigade dismantled in September, but forces have returned to key strongholds, where tunnel networks remain.",

      "Activity of troops of the 36th Division in the Rafah area on April 5th, 2025.\u00a0 (IDF)",
      "In the same statement on Saturday, Katz warned Gazans, \"Hamas is unable to protect the residents or the territory. Hamas leaders are hiding in tunnels with their families or living in luxury hotels abroad, with billions in bank accounts, using you as human shields. Now is the time to rise up, to get rid of Hamas, and to release all the Israeli hostages \u2014 that is the only way to stop the war.\"",
      "In their Oval Office meeting, Trump and Netanyahu reiterated their alignment on core issues. Netanyahu stated that Gazans should be \"free to choose to go wherever they want,\" in what some analysts view as a reference to renewed discussions about third-country resettlement. Trump went further, floating the idea of a U.S. presence in the Strip, noting, \"Gaza is an incredible piece of important real estate. Having a peace force like the United States there, controlling and owning the Gaza Strip would be a good thing.\"",
      "Javed Ali, a former senior director at the U.S. National Security Council and now a professor at the University of Michigan, offered a more measured view of the current military strategy. \"Now that we're almost a full month into the resumption of high-intensity IDF operations in the Gaza Strip against Hamas, Israel's military strategy appears to be focused on clearing and holding remaining pockets of known Hamas elements, which at the same time is displacing Palestinians throughout the territory.\"",
      "CEASEFIRE OVER AS ISRAEL STRIKES GAZA AFTER HAMAS REFUSED TO RELEASE HOSTAGES, OFFICIALS SAY",
      "Israeli forces establish the Morag Corridor in Gaza. (IDF)",
      "Ali said it remains unclear how Israel intends to manage or govern areas it clears. He drew comparisons to the U.S. experience in Iraq and Afghanistan. \"The U.S. encountered its own challenges in the post-9/11 wars with similar 'clear and hold' approaches, since insurgent and jihadist elements in both conflicts utilized guerrilla warfare tactics and terrorist attacks.\"",
      "While the Biden administration had previously emphasized humanitarian access, Ali noted that the current White House has not publicly pressed Israel to scale back its operations. \"That could change,\" he said, particularly as humanitarian conditions worsen or if negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program progress. \"If those talks gain momentum, Iran may pressure the U.S. to rein in Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas to preserve what remains of the group. Whether the U.S. team, led by Steve Witkoff, entertains such demands will be a key regional development to watch.\"",
      "On the ground, Israel has moved to reshape the humanitarian landscape in Gaza. The decision to restrict Hamas\u2019s access to aid reflects a broader policy shift under IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, who reversed his predecessor's stance and authorized the military to directly oversee the distribution of supplies. \"Hamas will not regain control over the aid, because that was its lifeline,\" an Israeli security official explained. \"It\u2019s what allowed it to maintain control over the territory throughout this period. People in Gaza know that Hamas controls the aid; if they realize that Hamas no longer does, its control within the Strip becomes ineffective.\"",
      "Israeli troops deployed to Gaza. (IDF)",
      "Humanitarian organizations and international leaders continue to condemn Israel. U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, speaking on April 8, condemned the ongoing blockade of aid. \"More than an entire month has passed without a drop of aid into Gaza. No food. No fuel. No medicine. Gaza is a killing field \u2014 and civilians are in an endless death loop,\" he said.",
      "Israel\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Oren Marmorstein, strongly rejected the Secretary-General\u2019s claims. \"As always, you don\u2019t let the facts get in the way when spreading slander against Israel,\" he posted on X. \"There is no shortage of humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip \u2014 over 25,000 aid trucks have entered during the 42 days of the ceasefire. Hamas used this aid to rebuild its war machine. Yet, not a word in your statement about the imperative for Hamas to leave Gaza. The people of Gaza are braver than you \u2014 they\u2019re calling, loud and clear, on Hamas to leave and stop abusing them.\"",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with Defense Minister Israel Katz (Israeli PM)",
      "Eugene Kontorovich, a senior legal scholar at the Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital: \"One doesn\u2019t need the Israeli Supreme Court to say there is no starvation in Gaza \u2014 this was admitted by the UN\u2019s own Food Security Phase Classification, which in June found that prior UN reports were inaccurate and that there is no famine. There is no serious evidence of starvation in Gaza, and what food scarcity does exist can be attributed to Hamas pillaging and hoarding aid. As the truth comes out, it becomes clear that the starvation claims were designed to halt Israel\u2019s legitimate self-defense against a genocidal attack.\"",

In late March, four Taiwanese soldiers, three of whom were part of a unit that provides security for Taiwan\u2019s Presidential Office, were jailed for up to seven years after being convicted of selling pictures of sensitive information to China.",
      "The verdicts came after last month\u2019s speech in which Lai condemned the\u00a0Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the harshest terms used by a Taiwanese leader in modern history. In his remarks, the president said Taiwan will not be \"bullied or manipulated\" and promised repercussions against those who make \"expressions of loyalty to the enemy.\"",
      "Lai, aware of Beijing\u2019s \"carrot and stick\" campaign, warned Taiwanese to be wary of China\u2019s \"United Front,\"\u00a0a political strategy employed by the CCP in which they \u2013 with plenty of smiles and often \"investment\" capital \u2013 enter international organizations and various influential groups and plant agents who then build alliances with targeted individuals, political parties and other interests.",

      "Yet some here are not buying Lai's threats. Dr. Huang Kwei-bo, a professor in the Department of Diplomacy at Taiwan\u2019s National Chengchi University, told Fox News Digital that all this \"get tough with China\" talk is mostly political theater: \"These dramatic Lai administration policy proposals are firstly maneuvers aimed at regaining control over Taiwan\u2019s parliament, as well as building momentum for upcoming local elections in late 2026.\"",

      "A broad majority of Taiwanese appear to want tougher measures against acts that threaten Taiwan\u2019s national sovereignty, but some analysts note the new tough talk has arrived just in time for Lai\u2019s party as it hopes to succeed in an ongoing effort to remove opposition Chinese Nationalist Party legislators from office, win control of municipal governments in local elections in November 2026 and then help Lai secure a second term in 2028.",

      "Soaring yields on 10- and 30-year Treasurys make it costlier for the federal government to borrow money. It\u2019s also bad news for consumers because the 10-year note\u2019s yield is directly linked to rates for mortgages, credit cards and personal and business loans.",
      "\u201cThis matters to nearly all Americans,\u201d said Natalie Colley, a partner and financial planner at the New York-based firm Francis Financial.",
      "\u201cGone are the days of a pension,\u201d she said, referring to the more than 70 million U.S. savers with access to 401(k) retirement accounts tied to markets. Volatility on Wall Street has unnerved many account holders in recent weeks, forcing some financial planners to do double duty as therapists to rattled clients.",
      "\u201cIf Treasurys are not a safe-haven asset, that has major implications for balance sheets across the board \u2014 businesses, nonprofits, pensions, households,\u201d said Ernie Tedeschi, a former top economist in the Biden administration who\u2019s now the director of economics at Yale University\u2019s Budget Lab. \u201cSo much of world finance is predicated on U.S. Treasurys being safe.\u201d",
      "He called recent bond market trends \u201cthe most concerning piece of data since the tariffs began.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s showing a deterioration in confidence in the U.S.\u2019s place in the world,\u201d he said.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has pushed back against such concerns, telling Fox Business on Wednesday, \u201cThere is nothing systemic about this. I think that it is an uncomfortable but normal deleveraging that\u2019s going on in the bond market.\u201d",
      "But experts see warning signs elsewhere, too. The value of the dollar relative to other global currencies has nosedived. This week it suffered its biggest drop since 2022 and ended Friday at its lowest level since September.",
      "\u201cEverything in the U.S. is not doing well right now,\u201d Kyla Scanlon, a financial educator and author of \u201cIn This Economy?: How Money and Markets Really Work,\u201d told her TikTok followers this week. \u201cThe U.S. dollar is getting crushed.\u201d",
      "She chalked up the currency\u2019s decline to \u201cthe erratic trade policy that we\u2019ve seen,\u201d adding: \u201cMarkets don\u2019t believe that the U.S. has a stable or clear economic plan.\u201d",
      "Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, flagged similar concerns.",
      "\u201cNormally when you see big tariff increases, I would have expected the dollar to go up. The fact that the dollar is going down at the same time I think lends some more credibility to the story of investor preferences shifting,\u201d he told CNBC on Friday.",
      "There are several other possible explanations. One has to do with the way hedge funds bet on bond markets. Another could be that investors are anticipating a run-up in inflation and demanding higher interest rates now so they don\u2019t lose money in the future.",
      "\u201cMaybe they feel, or the market feels, that the actions around tariffs are actually going to create upward inflationary pressure,\u201d said Douglas Boneparth, president of Bone Fide Wealth, an advisory firm in New York. \u201cThat very well could be part of the puzzle here.\u201d",
      "Even experts who are more hesitant to assign a cause to the bond sell-off say geopolitical factors are hard to ignore.",
      "So much of world finance is predicated on U.S. Treasurys being safe.",
      "Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics, yale budget lab",
      "\u201cThe idea of other countries turning away from America, I don\u2019t want to go down that rabbit hole necessarily,\u201d said Lee Baker, founder of Claris Financial Advisors in Atlanta. \u201cBut in this particular instance, America turned away from everybody else\u201d with steep new trade barriers.",
      "For now, Baker and other wealth advisers are cautioning clients not to react hastily to the recent volatility. Younger investors who aren\u2019t close to retirement \u2014 and typically have less exposure to the bond market \u2014 should stay the course, Colley said.",
      "\u201cMaking sure that you\u2019re in an appropriate asset allocation for your stage in life\u201d and building up some emergency savings can help create a \u201cfinancial moat that will insulate any investor at any point in their investing career from feeling panic around what\u2019s going on in the stock market,\u201d she said. If possible, she recommends keeping at least six months\u2019 of cash on hand for a rainy day.",
      "Older retirement savers can consider some protective measures, Baker said.",
      "His firm has been building buffer exchange-traded funds \u2014 so-called \u201cdefined-outcome\u201d ETFs tied to options contracts \u2014 into clients\u2019 portfolios. These funds tend to be more expensive and typically cap potential gains, but they offer robust downside protections and have seen a recent surge in interest. BlackRock launched a new iShares buffer ETF earlier this year, billing it as a way of \u201cmitigating risk while participating in market growth.\u201d",
      "Baker added that \u201cthere\u2019s a whole lot of other stuff in the world beyond stocks and bonds\u201d to consider investing in, such as real estate, infrastructure and private equity. But he cautioned that it\u2019s usually a good idea to consult a qualified adviser first, partly to avoid making important money moves out of fear.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s probably not a good idea to go whole hog in any of these,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we can certainly reduce your downside while giving you some upside with a combination of these things.\u201d"

      "The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield soared more than 50 basis points during the week, one of its largest jumps on record, as the whiplash from Trump\u2019s trade policy led investors to sell off U.S. assets.",
      "The\u00a0bond market\u2019s\u00a0move higher may have forced the White House\u2019s hand into some reversals, including a\u00a090-day tariff reprieve\u00a0on most countries in favor of a universal 10% rate announced Wednesday \u2014 excluding China.",
      "The items excluded from Trump\u2019s tariffs under the new guidelines are retroactive for products that have left the warehouse by April 5, 2025.

      "Xinis on Friday had directed the Trump administration to \u201ctake all available steps to facilitate\u201d Abrego Garcia\u2019s return following Thursday\u2019s high court order. She also asked for a daily update on Abrego Garcia\u2019s whereabouts.",
      "The Supreme Court decision did not require the Trump administration to immediately try to return Abrego Garcia because Xinis\u2019 deadline to bring him home had already passed. But the unsigned decision stated that the government \u201cshould be prepared to share what it can concerning the steps it has taken and the prospect of further steps.\u201d",
      "The ruling rejected the administration\u2019s emergency appeal of Xinis\u2019 April 4 order, which called for Abrego Garcia\u2019s return by April 7.",

But both parties are still waiting to see if they can convince a governor to try to flip one of their top targeted states next year.",
      "Democrats will have to reach into GOP territory to net the four seats they need to flip the chamber, while also defending competitive seats they currently hold in Georgia, Michigan and elsewhere. Republicans, meanwhile, are looking to grow their 53-47 majority in next year\u2019s elections while defending blue-leaning Maine, battleground North Carolina and some redder states.",
      "It\u2019s no surprise that both parties are eyeing governors as top recruits, since they have proved they can win statewide races and come with strong personal brands and fundraising bases \u2014 though, as some recent governors have learned, past wins do not always translate to Senate victories.",

Morgan Jackson, a Cooper adviser, said the former governor has not made a decision on a Senate run, and that Cooper has said he will not make a decision until after he finishes a fellowship at Harvard at the end of May.",

      "The fight for the Senate in 2026 is beginning to take shape, with more candidates launching campaigns in recent days and additional announcements expected in the coming weeks. But both parties are still waiting to see if they can convince a governor to try to flip one of their top targeted states next year.",
      "Democrats will have to reach into GOP territory to net the four seats they need to flip the chamber, while also defending competitive seats they currently hold in Georgia, Michigan and elsewhere. Republicans, meanwhile, are looking to grow their 53-47 majority in next year\u2019s elections while defending blue-leaning Maine, battleground North Carolina and some redder states.",
      "It\u2019s no surprise that both parties are eyeing governors as top recruits, since they have proved they can win statewide races and come with strong personal brands and fundraising bases \u2014 though, as some recent governors have learned, past wins do not always translate to Senate victories.",
      "Republicans\u2019 top target is Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff, the only Democratic senator running for re-election in a state President Donald Trump won in November. (Democrats are also defending a Senate seat in Michigan, now an open-seat contest with Sen. Gary Peters retiring.)",
      "While the GOP is eager to take on Ossoff, the party\u2019s field has been frozen while Gov. Brian Kemp weighs whether to jump into the race. Kemp, who is barred by term limits from running for governor again in 2026, has not made a decision on a Senate run and has just started the process of evaluating a potential campaign now that the state legislative session has concluded, according to a source familiar with his thinking.",
      "The source said there is no specific timeline for Kemp to make a decision \u2014 but that the governor is \u201cnot going to needlessly keep people waiting.\u201d",
      "Democrats, meanwhile, are waiting on a former governor to decide whether to take on one of their top targets: GOP\u00a0Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina.",
      "Democrats have not won a Senate race in the state since 2008, but former Gov. Roy Cooper, who could not run for re-election last year due to term limits, is seen as a strong recruit with proven statewide appeal.",
      "But Cooper is going to keep Democrats waiting for a little while longer. Morgan Jackson, a Cooper adviser, said the former governor has not made a decision on a Senate run, and that Cooper has said he will not make a decision until after he finishes a fellowship at Harvard at the end of May.",
      "Meanwhile, former Democratic Rep. Wiley Nickel launched his Senate campaign on Wednesday. On the prospect that Cooper could run, Nickel told Spectrum News\u2019 North Carolina Capital Tonight, \u201cWe\u2019ll cross that bridge when we get there.\u201d",
      "In Georgia, Republicans have been openly courting Kemp for months, with National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Tim Scott, R-S.C., telling Semafor back in January that Kemp is the party\u2019s \u201cNumber One recruit.\u201d",
      "Other Republicans are waiting in the wings in Georgia while Kemp weighs his options. Rep. Buddy Carter has suggested he would consider running if Kemp does not, and Reps. Rich McCormick and Mike Collins told Fox News that they aren\u2019t ruling out bids if the governor does not run. State Agriculture Commissioner Tyler Harper posted on X in February that he met with the NRSC,\u00a0and Insurance Commissioner John King also told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution late last year that he would \u201ctake a hard look\u201d at a Senate run \u2014 if Kemp stays out.",
      "NRSC spokesperson Joanna Rodriguez said in a statement to NBC News that the committee \u201cis going to work tirelessly with our incumbents and challengers to hold and expand the Republican Senate majority and continue delivering on President Trump\u2019s agenda for his entire term. We\u2019re committed to protecting red states and excited about the pickup opportunities we have in toss-up races in Georgia, Michigan, and New Hampshire.\u201d",
      "Democrats are eyeing another governor to take on their other top target: Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the only Republican senator up for re-election in a state former Vice President Kamala Harris won in November.",
      "Democratic Gov. Janet Mills did not rule out a run against Collins in a November interview with the Portland Press Herald but has been mum on the race since then.",
      "\u201cDemocrats have a Senate map that is ripe with offensive opportunities, particularly when coupled with the building midterm backlash against Republicans driven by their threats to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and their push to raise costs,\u201d said Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesperson Maeve Coyle. \u201cRepublicans have more seats to defend, and they\u2019re doing it in a hostile political environment.\u201d",
      "Open-seat shuffle",
      "While Georgia, North Carolina and Maine are the top states with Senate races in 2026, there are plenty more that could affect the balance of power. As the second-quarter fundraising period begins, some Senate hopefuls are also starting to solidify their plans in the three open-seat races where Democratic senators are not running for re-election.",
      "State Sen. Mallory McMorrow became the first major Democratic contender to jump into the race to replace Peters in battleground Michigan when she launched her campaign last week. But she isn\u2019t expected to be the last.",
      "Rep. Haley Stevens is considering a Senate run, along with Abdul El-Sayed, who stepped down from his post as the Wayne County health director last week. El-Sayed told the Detroit Free Press that he would make a decision \u201cwithin the next couple of weeks.\u201d First-term Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet, who had been weighing a run, told The Detroit News that she will instead run for re-election to the House.",
      "Former GOP Rep. Mike Rogers, the Republican nominee who lost last year\u2019s Michigan Senate race, said last month that he is \u201cseriously considering\u201d another campaign for Senate. The party\u2019s 2022 gubernatorial nominee, Tudor Dixon, is also weighing campaigns for governor or Senate in Michigan.",
      "New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen\u2019s decision to retire opened up the race in the Granite State, which could be competitive next year. Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas launched his Senate campaign last week, and fellow Rep. Maggie Goodlander is also still considering a run, according to a source familiar with her thinking.",
      "On the Republican side, former GOP Gov. Chris Sununu announced this week that he will not be running for Senate, noting he had been encouraged to run. But former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, who ran unsuccessfully against Shaheen in 2014, has been weighing a run for months. Brown is traveling the state and meeting with stakeholders, which he will continue to do \u201cover the next few weeks and months,\u201d said a Brown adviser. The former senator is in regular contact with Scott, the NRSC chairman.",
      "Democrats will also be defending an open seat in Minnesota, where Sen. Tina Smith is retiring, although it\u2019s not clear if Republicans can make the race competitive.",
      "Former basketball player Royce White, who lost\u00a0to Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar last year and has a history of controversial statements, is running again. The rest of the GOP field is still in flux, with names like former sportscaster Michele Tafoya and former professional basketball player Willie Burton in the mix as potential candidates.",
      "On the Democratic side, Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan launched her campaign for Senate last month, along with former state Senate Minority Leader Melisa L\u00f3pez Franzen. Democratic Rep. Angie Craig is also considering a Senate run, telling The Minnesota Star Tribune that she plans to make her decision this month. Craig is also planning to hold town halls in each of the state\u2019s four Republican-held congressional districts.",
      "Rep. Ilhan Omar, who had been weighing a Senate campaign,\u00a0announced Thursday that she will run for re-election to the House.",
      "Democratic recruitment in other, more Republican-leaning states could also affect the party\u2019s ability to go on offense next year.",
      "Former Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown has been weighing running in the special Senate election next year against appointed GOP Sen. Jon Husted, as well as a run for governor in 2026, according to a Brown spokesperson. Brown recently converted his federal Senate campaign committee into a PAC for his \u201cDignity of Work\u201d organization, but the spokesperson said this is not a sign that Brown has passed on a Senate run.",
      "\u201cSen. Brown has been clear that he has not made any decisions or ruled anything out,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "Former Democratic Rep. Colin Allred has also said he\u2019s considering another run for Senate in Texas, where GOP Sen. John Cornyn will also have to contend with a competitive primary race against state Attorney General Ken Paxton."

Kozak, a senior bureau official in the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs at the State Department, wrote in a two-page sworn declaration. \u201cHe is alive and secure in that facility. He is detained pursuant to the sovereign, domestic authority of El Salvador.\u201d",

I respect the Supreme Court,\u201d the attorneys quoted Trump as telling reporters Friday night.",

      "\u201cOf course,\u201d the man's lawyers wrote, \u201cthat is precisely what the Supreme Court did when it ruled that this Court\u2019s injunction \u2018properly requires the Government to \u201cfacilitate\u201d Abrego Garcia\u2019s release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.\u2019\u201d",

      "Xinis on Friday had directed the Trump administration to \u201ctake all available steps to facilitate\u201d Abrego Garcia\u2019s return following Thursday\u2019s high court order. She also asked for a daily update on Abrego Garcia\u2019s whereabouts.",
      "The Supreme Court decision did not require the Trump administration to immediately try to return Abrego Garcia because Xinis\u2019 deadline to bring him home had already passed. But the unsigned decision stated that the government \u201cshould be prepared to share what it can concerning the steps it has taken and the prospect of further steps.\u201d",
      "The ruling rejected the administration\u2019s emergency appeal of Xinis\u2019 April 4 order, which called for Abrego Garcia\u2019s return by April 7.",
      "On Friday, the government said it needed more time to provide Xinis with the requested information on Abrego Garcia.",
      "The Maryland father, a legal resident protected from deportation by a 2019 court order, was mistakenly sent to the Salvadoran prison along with other men who were alleged to be gang members.",
      "The Trump administration claims Abrego Garcia is a member of MS-13, though he has never been charged with or convicted of a crime.

      "Two of the oldest recordings, discovered in a basement where they\u2019d been stored for 30 years, were found on their original acetate disc recorded at the old WARL radio station in Arlington, NBC Washington reported. Many of the tracks were recorded in D.C. or Virginia.",

      "DETROIT \u2014 As President\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a025% tariffs on imported vehicles\u00a0remain in effect despite a pullback this week on other country-based levies, analysts are expecting massive global implications for the automotive industry due to the policies.",
      "They\u2019re expecting to see a drop in vehicle sales in the millions,\u00a0higher new and used vehicle prices, and increased costs of more than $100 billion for the industry, according to research reports from Wall Street and automotive analysts.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now is a structural shift, driven by policy, that\u2019s likely to be long-lasting,\u201d Felix Stellmaszek, Boston Consulting Group\u2019s global lead of automotive and mobility, told CNBC. \u201cThis may well be the most consequential year for the auto industry in history \u2014 not just because of immediate cost pressures, but because it\u2019s forcing fundamental change in how and where the industry builds.\u201d",
      "More from CNBC",

      "Automakers seek \u2018opportunity in the chaos\u2019 of Trump\u2019s tariffs",
      "BCG expects tariffs to add $110 billion to $160 billion on an annual run rate basis in costs to the industry, which could impact 20% of U.S. new-vehicle market revenues, increasing production costs for both U.S. and non-U.S. manufacturers.",
      "The Center for Automotive Research, a Michigan-based nonprofit think tank, believes costs for automakers in the U.S. alone will increase by $107.7 billion. That includes $41.9 billion for Detroit automakers\u00a0General Motors,\u00a0Ford Motor\u00a0and Chrysler parent\u00a0Stellantis.",
      "Both analyses take into account the 25% tariffs on imported vehicles implemented by Trump on April 3 as well as forthcoming levies of the\u00a0same amount on automotive parts\u00a0that are set to begin by May 3.",
      "Automakers and suppliers may be able to bear some of the cost increases, but they\u2019re also expected to pass them along to U.S. consumers, which could in turn lower sales, according to analysts.",
      "\u201cWe believe the tariffs as proposed will raise the cost of both importing and manufacturing vehicles in the US by at least a low to mid single digit thousand dollar level on average, and we believe it will be hard for the auto industry to fully pass this on, especially with softening consumer demand more generally,\u201d Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney said in a Thursday investor note.",
      "Goldman Sachs assumes new vehicle net prices in the U.S. will rise by roughly $2,000 to $4,000 over the next six- to 12-month timeframe to better reflect tariff costs.",
      "Automakers have\u00a0responded to the tariffs\u00a0in a variety of ways. Manufacturers that are mostly domestic, such as Ford\u00a0and Stellantis, have announced temporary deals for employee pricing, while others, such as British carmaker Jaguar Land Rover, have ceased U.S. shipments.\u00a0Hyundai Motor\u00a0also has said it would not raise prices for at least two months to ease consumer concerns.",
      "Consumer sentiment grew even worse than anticipated in April as the expected inflation level hit its highest since 1981, a closely watched University of Michigan\u00a0survey showed Friday.",
      "Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of insights at\u00a0auto advisory firm Telemetry, expects many automakers have at least a roughly two-month supply of non-tariff impacted vehicles that they will be able to sell down before needing to increase prices due to tariffs.",
      "Telemetry expects the higher costs for production, parts and other factors to result in upward of 2 million fewer vehicles sold annually in the U.S. and Canada, which will have ripple effects on the broader economy.",
      "\u201cA couple million-unit reduction in sales will have a broad impact economically,\u201d Abuelsamid said. \u201cThat\u2019s driven by higher prices, not just for vehicles, but across the board \u2026 which is going to limit people\u2019s\u2019 spending power.\u201d",
      "Affordability of new and used vehicles has been a problem for several years. On average, Cox Automotive reports new vehicles\u00a0cost nearly $50,000.\u00a0That figure doesn\u2019t include the cost of financing such a vehicle, which has risen significantly in recent years in an attempt to combat inflation.",
      "Auto loan rates remain near decades-high levels of\u00a0more than 9.64% for a new vehicle\u00a0and nearly 15% for a used car or truck, according to Cox.",
      "\u201cWe expect to see declining discounting and then accelerated price increases as the tariffs are passed through and supply tightens, leading to price increases on all types of most new vehicles,\u201d Cox Automotive Chief Economist Jonathan Smoke said during a\u00a0virtual event Monday.\u00a0\u201cOver the longer term, we expect production and sales to fall, newly used prices to increase, and some models to be eliminated.\u201d",
      "Expected price increases vary based on vehicle, but Cox estimates a $6,000 increase to the cost of imported vehicles due to the 25% tariff on non-U.S. assembled vehicles, as well as a $3,600 increase to vehicles assembled in the U.S. due to upcoming 25% tariffs on automotive parts. Those are in addition to $300 to $500 increases as a result of previously announced tariffs on steel and aluminum."

      "It turns out the captain, Robert Daly (a not-so-friendly Jesse Plemons) had cloned his workplace and kept his colleagues captive within a video game. By the end of the episode, Daly met his (well-deserved) end, the crew was finally free. The \u201cInfinity\u201d game\u2019s universe was at their disposal.",

      "What have the clones been up to since 'USS Callister'?",
      "Taking place a few months after the events of the original Season 4 episode, we learn that the \"Infinity\" clones are now mercenaries, robbing random players for credit sticks to (illegally) survive inside the game.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s 30 million players versus the five of us,\u201d clone Nanette (Milioti) points out.",

      "On the outside, real Dudani (Paul G. Raymond) urges Walton (Simpson) to address the in-game robberies, since it\u2019s not the first time a complaint has been filed. Walton ignores him, leading Dudani to quit on the spot.",
      "Meanwhile, a New York Times journalist visits Walton under the guise of writing a profile, but it\u2019s really a ruse to get him to talk about the banned DNA digital cloner that was found after Daly\u2019s death and the possibility of the rogue players being illegal clones. Walton kicks him out \u2014 but not before Nanette hears the entire conversation.",
      "Real Nanette takes the opportunity to help a visibly shaken Walton to ID the rogue players and discovers they\u2019re the clones of herself and Nate (Osy Ikhile).",

      "Inside the Callister, clone Karl (Billy Magnussen) throws out the idea of flying back into Daly\u2019s private game build. And though it seems improbable, it\u2019s not impossible.",
      "\u201cIf we can access the game\u2019s source code, we can compile a private development build of a whole universe of our own,\u201d clone Nanette says. \u201cThere\u2019d be no more credits, no more other players, no more threats. It would just be us, and we\u2019d be safe.\u201d",
      "The only problem? The only people who could access the source code, Daly and clone Walton, are dead. Or so they think.",
      "Clone Walton has a room aboard the Callister, which should not have spawned since he died before the ship reset itself and the rooms are assigned to players who are alive. Clone Nanette and Dudani believe that a small part of Walton must have survived, so he\u2019s alive in the game on a planet that spawned at the same time he died. Real Nanette has the same idea. She and real Walton enter the game.",

It wasn\u2019t a game but an immersive experience meant to mimic his favorite show \u201cSpace Fleet.\u201d Walton, thinking only about profits, convinced Daly to forgo his original plans and pivot to an multiplayer online game and subscription model.",

      "After realizing that real Walton is worried because the literal core of \u201cInfinity\u201d is illegal, clone Nanette tries to warn real Nanette. Clone Nanette is sadly too late, as her outside self is in coma, essentially brain dead after the accident. The accident comes as a shock to clone Nanette, but they continue on their journey to the Heart of Infinity.",
      "Back with the crew, the Callister has arrived to the Heart and clone Nanette is teleported to the core, which is an exact recreation of Daly\u2019s neighborhood.",

      "After clone Nanette finishes her story, clone Daly is grappling with the fact that his real self was a vile person, and that Walton exploited his talents.",
      "He agrees to help clone Nanette, but gives her a choice aside from simply leaving. Clone Daly explains that he can transfer her consciousness through the machine real Nanette is hooked up to. The catch? She can only choose one: go back to her old life, but the ship and the crew is wiped, or go with the original plan and save them all.",
      "Clone Nanette chooses to save them all, and clone Daly reveals there was always a choice to do them both; it was just a test of nobility based on an episode of \u201cSpace Fleet.\u201d Clone Daly begins the universe transfer, but he wants to \u201ccopy and paste\u201d instead of \u201ccut and paste\u201d so another copy of clone Nanette could stay with him.",
      "\u201cI will let her stay. I will treat her good,\u201d clone Daly insists.",
      "Clone Nanette objects, sending clone Daly into a rage and hurting her. Clone Nanette is able to save herself by killing clone Daly, but this activates a kill switch to the delete the game.",
      "Clone Nanette is thankfully able to complete transfer in the eleventh hour. \u201cInfinity\u201d is deleted, and Walton watches his company crash in real time.",
      "What happens to the Callister crew? What about Walton?",
      "Clone Nanette wakes up in the hospital in the body of real Nanette and is over the moon. She then receives a call from the Callister crew and they let her know there were saved \u2014 but they\u2019re also part of her consciousness and they can see what she\u2019s seeing.",
      "Three months later, Walton is arrested and charged after being on the run. We see Nanette indulging in his downfall with the rest of the Callister crew while working on a way to figure out extracting the crew from her consciousness and enjoying binging the crew\u2019s favorite show: \u201cThe Real Housewives of Atlanta.\u201d",
      "How did the stars feel about the twist?",
      "Milioti says that twist with Walton and Daly actually didn\u2019t come as a shock to her.",
      "\u201cIt felt (timely) that someone would be sentenced to the disease of capitalism. \u2018You must be productive of all costs,\u2019 but at the cost of your life,\u201d Milioti says. \u201cIt felt true for those characters. You would understand why it would drive Daly mad and it\u2019s something that Walton would completely do.\u201d",
      "The biggest twist for Milioti was actually Nanette\u2019s accident.",
      "\u201cI remember reading that like, \u2018Wow that is incredible\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cI never saw it . It happens so fast.\u201d",
      "How did they feel about the ending?",
      "Milioti loves the \u201ctwisted and unexpected\u201d ending for Nanette.",
      "\u201cI thought it was so demented and unexpected and strange and funny,\u201d she says. \u201cIt somehow enters us into a new genre of body possession comedy.\u201d",
      "Simpson he was surprised that they went in that direction, but that \u201cit seemed like the only way.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re going to explore a world like this, it\u2019s not just figuring out how to make a fun spot for people to enjoy the characters they love,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s about creating a reason for them to need to get to know them more. Now the sequel is essential viewing.\u201d",
      "Simpson is also satisfied with the downfall of his character.",

      "Will there be more to the Callister crew\u2019s story?",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a cracked door for sure,\u201d Milioti says.",
      "\u201cI think Charlie (Brooker), his mind, can go in 20 million different directions and I\u2019m sure if he wants to continue it, the idea would be very strange and cool and creepy and funny,\u201d she says.",
      "Simpson shared a similar sentiment.",
      "\u201cI feel like there\u2019s so many ways they could go,\u201d he says. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s like the rest of Black Mirror. It\u2019s about the writing, it\u2019s about finding the truth in what\u2019s so extraordinary. So I know if that were to happen again, Charlie would follow his instincts and I know everyone in the cast and crew would join in.\u201d",

      "\u201cI hear Mark saying, \u2018Why didn\u2019t you tell me who you were?\u2019\u201d Nicci recalls.",
      "\u201cAnd Tanner, who always walks around the house holding the phone in everyone\u2019s face, comes up to me while I\u2019m packing \u2014 hat on, bags half-zipped, just got back from my other son\u2019s shoot \u2014 and he goes, \u2018Mom, this is Mr. Mark. Say hi!\u2019\u201d she adds.",

      "\u201cHe doesn\u2019t think in terms of celebrity,\u201d she says. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t trying to name-drop or anything like that. He was just pumped to meet \u2018Mr. Mark.\u2019 That\u2019s what he called him, like he\u2019s someone\u2019s dad. He\u2019s not thinking of Mark as an actor or celebrity. Just a nice man whose daughter goes to Clemson.\u201d",
      "When Wahlberg asked why Tanner didn\u2019t mention who he was during their initial meeting, \u201cTanner just said, \u2018I was just excited to meet you.\u2019 That\u2019s it. So pure,\u201d Nicci explains.",
      "Tanner's FaceTime with Wahlberg coincided with another big moment in his life.",
      "He got a major surprise during his appearance on \u201cThe Kelly Clarkson Show\u201d earlier this month when he met his idol, Jack Black. Tanner previously received a video message from Black the last time he was on Clarkson\u2019s show and expressed that he wanted to be 31 when he met Black for the first time.",
      "Unfortunately, Tanner didn\u2019t get his wish. Instead, he got to meet Black when he was 26.",
      "After Black pretended to be delivering another pre-recorded video message for Tanner, the actor burst through the doors of the studio and rushed toward the stage to meet Tanner in person. Tanner's excitement was palpable as he ran toward the actor and gave him a hug.",
      "Their sweet interaction continued when Black joined Tanner, who dished plenty of admiration and praise for the actor. At one point, Tanner even told Black that he was going to get his phone number so the duo could work out together."

The stakes become immediately very high.\u201d",
      "What's the premise of 'Drop'?",
      "Single, widowed mom Violet (Fahy) finally decides to go on a first date, hinting that her last relationship \u2014 which resulted in the birth of her son Toby (Jacob Robinson) \u2014 wasn\u2019t healthy.",
      "With her sister, Jen (Violett Beane), babysitting Toby for the night at Violet\u2019s house, Violet embarks on her date at The Palate, an upscale restaurant on the top floor of a tall building.",
      "Violet gets a text from her date, a photographer named Henry (Brandon Sklenar), informing her he will be late, so she grabs a glass of wine at the bar first. There, she meets friendly bartender Cara (Gabrielle Ryan), flirty pianist Phil (Ed Weeks) and Richard (Reed Diamond) \u2014 a nervous man waiting for his blind date to arrive.",
      "She receives a meme over Digi Drop, the movie\u2019s version of AirDrop, but she declines it as Henry finally arrives, camera bag in tow, claiming if he leaves it in the car someone might break in to try and steal it.",
      "The two are seated and begin their date, with Violet explaining that she needs to keep her phone on the table in case Jen or Toby needs anything from her. Henry is completely fine with this, even giving her a hockey puck he bought as a gift for Toby.",
      "Their date goes smoothly, until Violet starts receiving multiple Digi Drops that get darker and darker in their content. She brings her concerns to Henry, but he says it's probably someone just pranking her. He explains you have to be within 50 feet of someone to send them a Digi Drop so he walks around the restaurant, measuring how far the prankster could be. He concludes that they must be in the dining room with them.",
      "Despite this, the date remains in good spirits until Violet gets a message over Digi Drop from an unknown user called \"Let's Play.\" They tell her to check her security cameras, which she does, seeing that there's a masked man in her home with a gun and a silencer.",
      "She then gets a text from Let's Play telling her to keep her mouth shut and that her phone is cloned so they can see everything she does. They tell her if she calls the cops, Toby dies.",
      "Let's Play tells Violet that if she wants Toby to live, she needs to steal and destroy the SD card from Henry's camera, which she does \u2014 pretending she lost her watch to distract him and flushing the crushed SD card down the toilet. Before she does, however, she sees some of the photos stored on it, which are of politicians and wire transfer statements.",
      "Then, she's given a much harder task: she's instructed to kill Henry if she wants Toby to live. Let's Play secretly stashed a vial of poison in the bathroom for her to use, which they explain will kill Henry \"quickly and painlessly.\"",
      "When Violet says she can\u2019t kill someone, Let\u2019s Play responds that she\u2019s killed someone before \u2014 she can do it again.",
      "Very aware of all the cameras on her and the bugs at her table and in the bathroom, she tries to determine who in the restaurant it could be, but to no avail. During all of this, Henry senses something is wrong and tries to leave the date. After being informed that Toby will die if Henry leaves, she convinces him to stay with a kiss.",
      "Henry stays and, despite the life-or-death situation going on, they are able to bond, with Henry sharing that he's worked for the mayor for five years \u2014 although he doesn't seem happy about it.",
      "When Henry asks her why she's a therapist, Violet explains that she works with abuse survivors as she's a survivor herself and wants to help others now. She says the trauma of abuse rears its head at different times, explaining away some of her weird behavior that evening.",
      "Over the course of the date, Violet struggles with the ethics of killing Henry, trying different tricks to secretly let others know her son is in danger \u2014 including secretly informing Phil, but this only gets him killed too.",
      "In response, Let's Play has the masked man in her home attack Jen, knocking her out with the butt of his gun. The masked man then picks Toby up and locks him in his room.",
      "Seeing how truly serious the situation is, Violet decides to kill Henry, convincing him to do a shot with her to reset.",
      "Who's behind 'Let's Play' in Drop?",
      "On her way to the bar to grab two tequila shots, Violet unknowingly knocks her purse over. Out spills the watch she had pretended to lose.",
      "At the bar, she tries to pour the poison into one of the shots but gets a message telling her she must pour it at the table. So, she declines the limes bartender Cara offers her and heads back to the table.",
      "There, Henry confronts her about the watch that fell out of her purse, asking her why she's lying to him. The two have a heartfelt conversation about being honest and genuine. Violet admits to staying in an abusive relationship even after her son was born. She says she is still stuck in it at times, revealing she once watched Blake almost kill Toby as she just sat there.",
      "\"And that's the kind of mother I am,\" she says, to which Henry confides that in the past, he's found himself in a messed-up situation that hurt good people for a long time and he still feels the guilt.",
      "Henry tells Violet that abusive people will make you feel guilty, even if they are dead. Violet tells Henry he's a good guy, but still pretends she forgot the limes for their shots. When Henry goes to grab them, she poisons his shot.",
      "Henry asks if they can toast to \"hope,\" which they do. The poisoned shot is on his lips, but Violet has a change of heart. She spills her red wine all over him so he won't take the shot.",
      "\"That wasn't smart,\" Let's Play texts Violet as Henry goes to clean up in the bathroom.",
      "Cara approaches Violet, saying she can tell she's been acting weird all night and offering to help get her out of a bad date. Then she gives away the clue that puts the pieces together for Violet.",
      "Cara tells her that Richard has been staring at Violet all night and is seated at a table another regular normally requests.",
      "Violet pieces together that Richard must be Let's Play as he's been watching her all night and Violet knew that whoever Let's Play was called ahead and requested her table and their own.",
      "She goes over to Richard and offers him a shot. He refuses the shot kindly but uses her name while turning it down. She tells him that she never told him her name.",
      "That's when Richard drops all pretenses and darkly tells her to sit. He takes out his earpiece and tells her he admires her tenacity, although he says it won't help her.",
      "He makes her drink one of the shots she brought over (non-poisoned) as he explains that the table he's sitting at is situated in the blind spot of the cameras. He explains that people hired him to get rid of Henry and the SD card as those were the final two loose ends left for covering up the mayor's fraud. He also reveals that Henry is an FBI informant.",
      "Richard's plan will have Violet take the fall for Henry's death as she's on camera poisoning his shot at her table and he made the poison from drugs Violet often prescribes. He says it will be painted as \"widow assassin strikes again,\" despite Violet maintaining she didn't kill her husband.",
      "Pants now clean, Henry approaches Violet and Richard. Richard immediately starts playing nice again, offering Henry the poisoned shot, which he initially refuses but then takes.",
      "Violet asks Henry to give them one more minute and she will explain everything. Henry excuses himself. Richard then calls the masked man to call off the kill mission on Toby and tells Violet that her son will be safe.",
      "He digs into the dessert in front of him, saying all that's left is for him to enjoy his dessert and watch Henry die.",
      "As Richard eats, Violet reveals that this meal reminds her of the last time her abusive husband Blake took her out for dinner. She says he would always take her for an \"apology dinner,\" which taught her how to be good at pretending.",
      "She tells Richard she only pretended to poison the shot and that while he was talking to Henry just a moment ago, she poisoned his dessert.",
      "Furious at being outsmarted, Richard pulls out a gun and shoots at Violet, but Henry pushes her out of the way \u2014 taking the bullet himself. One of Richard's bullets whizzes past and hits the glass wall, where small cracks begin to form.",
      "Violet confronts him, grabbing the closest thing she can reach: the puck Henry bought as a gift for Toby. She chucks the hockey puck at the cracks in the glass window, causing it to burst open where the force of the wind sucks Richard out of it.",
      "But the wind is so strong that Violet is also sucked out of the window.",
      "She grabs hold of a ripping tablecloth, dangling over the side of the building until a bleeding Henry pulls her back up to safety. She instructs Henry to apply pressure to his wound, then takes his keys and drives home quickly since before Richard died, he had instructed his counterpart to kill Jen and Toby.",
      "Back at Violet's house, Jen is mid fight with the intruder, trying her hardest to keep Toby safe. Violet arrives, grabbing a kitchen knife and sneaking up behind him to stab him in the chest.",
      "The masked man throws Violet across the table, kicking her in the side. The masked man gets ready to kill Violet, but Toby uses his remote control toy truck to deliver the gun to Violet, which she quickly grabs and kills the intruder with.",
      "What happens with Henry and Violet?",
      "The end of the movie takes place while Henry and Jen are both recuperating from gunshot wounds in the hospital. A news program in the background informs viewers that the mayor's office has been linked to an embezzlement scheme.",
      "Violet visits Henry with food, where he thanks her for saving his life. The pair agrees to a second date before drinking the milkshakes Violet brought for them."

Starting when Piper was 11, her account featured videos of her and her posse of tween sidekicks pulling pranks, performing skits and doing goofy viral challenges for millions of followers.",
      "However, for all their upbeat smiles on camera, Piper and her friends were experiencing a much darker reality behind the scenes, including alleged \u201cverbal, physical and, at times, sexual abuse\u201d at the hands of Piper\u2019s mother and producer, Tiffany Smith, a lawsuit filed in January 2022 by 11 former \u201cSquad\u201d members says.",

      "Read on to learn more about teen influencer Piper Rockelle, why her mom was sued for $22 million, and where they both are now.",
      "Who is Piper Rockelle?",
      "Piper Rockelle, 17, is an influencer with more than 30 million followers across YouTube, TikTok and Instagram.",
      "She rose to viral fame at age 8 when she began posting videos on YouTube with help from her mom and \u201cmomager,\u201d Tiffany Smith.",
      "When Piper was 11, Smith began recruiting other kids to appear in her daughter\u2019s videos, and the group of tweens and teens became known as \u201cPiper\u2019s Squad.\u201d",
      "Over the next few years, the Squad churned out hundreds of videos of themselves pulling pranks on each other, dancing to lip sync videos, completing viral challenges, and confessing to their crushes.",
      "The channel was incredibly lucrative for Smith and her daughter. At one point, Piper was earning more than half a million dollars per month for her video content, according to The Los Angeles Times.",
      "Other members of the Squad routinely earned five figures per month via their own YouTube channels thanks to their association with Piper, according to a 2022 court document.",
      "While Piper\u2019s channel was presented as a harmless collection of videos about a group of tweens\u2019 silly pranks and adventures, it reportedly had a darker side.",
      "As the years went on, former Squad members began speaking out about physical, sexual and emotional abuse they had allegedly suffered at the hands of Smith. Accusations of exploitation and labor violations also arose.",
      "A group of former Squad members sued Smith and her business partner, Hunter Hill, in January 2022. Piper was not named as a defendant in the lawsuit.",
      "Why was Piper Rockelle\u2019s mom sued?",
      "In 2022, 11 former members of Piper\u2019s \u201cSquad\u201d sued\u00a0Rockelle\u2019s mother, Tiffany Smith, seeking damages of at least $2 million each, or $22 million total.",

      "Hill, 28, portrayed a big brother-like figure to Piper on screen, but off camera he reportedly had a romantic relationship with Piper\u2019s mom and was \u201cthe primary director, editor and cinematographer\u201d of Piper\u2019s YouTube videos, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The complaint sought damages for sexual battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress, among several other alleged violations.",
      "The plaintiffs, all of whom were minors when the lawsuit was filed, accused Smith of \u201cgrossly inappropriate, offensive and abusive treatment.\u201d They claimed Smith made vulgar comments about their bodies, and at times touched them inappropriately.",
      "According to the complaint, Smith encouraged minors in the Squad to behave sexually with each other and to act proactively in videos and photos, such as urging them to make \u201csexy kissing faces\u201d or to \u201cwear something sluttier\u201d because \u201csex sells.\u201d",
      "According to the complaint, Smith and Hill would \u201csabotage\u201d children who left the Squad, targeting their individual YouTube channels.",
      "Smith and Hill allegedly engaged in a variety of tactics to \u201ctank\u201d former Squad members\u2019 online platforms, such as flooding them with bot subscribers, which can negatively affect how videos are promoted on YouTube, and falsely flagging their channels as \u201cinappropriate\u201d to get their content restricted.",
      "These alleged tactics led to a \u201csignificant loss\u201d in subscribers and viewerships for the plaintiffs, which translated to a loss of income, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Smith denied the allegations against her. In July 2023, she countersued for $30 million, accusing the plaintiffs\u2019 mothers of attempting to extort her by making false allegations of sexual abuse, according to NBC News. She later voluntarily abandoned the lawsuit.",
      "In a December 2022 interview with The Los Angeles Times, Smith questioned the motives of the plaintiffs bringing the lawsuit against her.",
      "\u201cThis whole case is based on lies that are driven by financial jealousy,\u201d she said. \u201cFinancial jealousy of a 15-year-old girl.\u201d",
      "Smith has also denied allegations that she violated California labor laws in the filming of the Squad videos. Several parents of former Squad members have said their children filmed up to 12 hours per day and did not receive proper education on set, according to the Times.",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to Hill for comment and has not heard back at the time of publication.",
      "\u201cImagine if these kids had been on a movie set for Lionsgate,\u201d Matthew Sarelson, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, told the Times in 2022. \u201cPeople would go to jail if this had happened at a studio.\u201d",
      "Smith has denied that she was running a professional production studio and said it was parents\u2019 responsibility to manage their kids\u2019 schooling.",
      "The Squad members\u2019 lawsuit was settled in October 2024 for $1.85 million, according to NBC News.",
      "\u201cThis was never about the money \u2014 it was about holding an individual accountable, telling the truth, and taking a step toward healing,\u201d Angela Sharbino, the parent of one of the plaintiffs, said in a statement, according to NBC News. \u201cAll of these kids have now moved on from the \u2018Squad\u2019 and are closing this chapter of their lives.\u201d",
      "Where are Piper Rockelle and Tiffany Smith now?Piper continues to share content on social media.",
      "After the 2022 lawsuit was filed, YouTube demonetized Piper\u2019s channel, meaning she could no longer earn revenue from her videos. She still posts occasional YouTube videos, such as a 10-minute vlog entitled \u201cWeek in my Life as a Full Time Influencer\u201d in November 2024.",
      "\u201cObviously I film vlogs like this, but I don\u2019t really get a lot out of it besides the satisfaction of knowing you guys enjoy watching them, and I get a lot of fun memories that I can go back and watch, which I think is cool,\u201d she says in the video.",
      "The teen adds that she now does other types of work to \u201cyou know, keep the house over my head,\u201d such as brand deals and paid TikTok videos.",
      "Smith and Hill still appear to oversee the creation of Piper\u2019s videos. In her 2024 \u201cWeek in the Life\u201d video, a narrator who appears to be Hill says Smith \u201ccompletely rearranged and decorated\u201d a room in their house so Piper could film TikTok videos at all hours.",
      "One scene from the 2024 vlog shows Piper decorating a Christmas tree at 11:30 p.m. as part of a paid brand deal.",
      "The narrator, who appears to be Hill, says in the video that after they are done filming the Christmas tree scene, they still have to shoot something for her vlog that is going out \u201cin a couple hours.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have to finish editing it and we don\u2019t have a thumbnail for it,\u201d he says. \u201cSo there are so many stresses, you guys have no idea what this is like.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut it\u2019s not that bad,\u201d Piper chimes in.",
      "Piper has more than 14 million fans on TikTok, where she posts frequent videos featuring her hanging out with her boyfriend, lip syncing to viral songs, and sometimes posing in bikinis and other revealing outfits.",
      "She also has an account on BrandArmy, a platform that allows creators as young as 13 to share paid photos and videos of themselves, with parental oversight. The site is only open to subscribers over the age of 18.",
      "In her 2024 vlog, Piper says she is \u201cgrateful\u201d for the opportunity to create content, but also shares a candid look at her life and responsibilities.",
      "\u201cI have no room to complain about my life because things could be a lot worse. But what I do have to say is, it is hard work on my end. I\u2019ve never had, like, a normal job, but whatever I\u2019m doing right now, it feels like a job. It takes a lot out of me. I go to bed at night and I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh my God, what did I do today?\u2019\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cAnd on top of everything, all I want to do most of the time is just go work out because it makes me so happy,\u201d she continues. \u201cIt\u2019s, like, the one moment in my life when everything is quiet and I don\u2019t have to think about anything or please anybody.\u201d"

In it, Rourke is heard making comments about Siwa in the backyard, including suggesting he could change the 21-year-old performer's sexuality.",

      "Titled \u201cToo Hurty Without It,\u201d Episode 5 puts the spotlight on Natalia Grace \u2014 portrayed by 27-year-old British actor Imogen Faith Reed \u2014 after her adoptive parents, Michael and Kristine Barnett, move and leave her on her own in a small apartment.",
      "The episode, creator and co-showrunner Katie Robbins tells TODAY.com, was meant to make viewers question \u201ceverything they\u2019ve seen before and their assumptions that they\u2019ve made\u201d surrounding Natalia and her circumstances.",
      "\u201cGood American Family\u201d is a fictionalization of Grace\u2019s true story. Born in Ukraine with a rare form of dwarfism, Grace was adopted by a New Hampshire couple in 2008, before they put her up for re-adoption in 2010, according to a 2021 document from the Court of Appeals in Indiana obtained by TODAY.com.",
      "Grace was then adopted by Michael and Christine Barnett, who began to suspect that she was not a little girl, but a grown adult who was trying to kill them. According to the Court of Appeals document, Grace's Ukrainian adoption paperwork stated she was born in 2003.",
      "The couple had Grace medically and psychologically tested, before they successfully had a court order to change her birth year from 2003 to 1989, \u201cbased on age estimates provided by a primary care physician and social worker,\u201d per the document from the Indiana Court of Appeals.",
      "Grace has maintained that she was a child at the time of her adoption, and that Kristine Barnett told her to say she was older. \u201cI was terrified of her. I was terrified, so when Kristine told me to tell people that I was 22, I listened because I didn\u2019t know what she would have me do. I didn\u2019t know what she would do to me,\u201d Grace says in the documentary \"The Curious Case of Natalia Grace.\"",
      "\u201cShe threatened me into telling people lies. At first I said, \u2018No, I\u2019m a kid,\u2019 and I guess she just got so mad,\" she continued.",
      "According to a 2019 affidavit filed in the Tippecanoe Court in Indiana obtained by\u00a0TODAY.com, a doctor at Peyton Manning Children\u2019s Hospital examined Grace and determined her age was about 8. A skeletal examination of Grace found she was 11 years old in 2012, per the affidavit.",
      "The document from the Indiana Court of Appeals also states that in 2013, the Barnetts did in fact move Grace into two apartments in Indiana and helped her get federal disability benefits and supportive services to help her \u201cas an adult.\u201d The couple then relocated to Canada with their three biological children.",
      "This is where Episode 5 starts. Prior to that, \u201cGood American Family\u201d was told from Kristine Barnett (Ellen Pompeo) and Michael Barnett\u2019s (Mark Duplass) perspective, depicting Natalia as a sinister adult pretending to be a child.",
      "The latest episode details Natalia living on her own without her walker. She struggles with everyday tasks like turning on the shower and getting into the bathtub, which makes her unable to bathe herself. Because of her small stature, she isn't able to reach the top cabinets in the kitchen and finds it difficult to make herself a meal. She is seen spending her days in front of the television, eating junk food as the apartment becomes a mess.",
      "All alone, at one point, she accidentally cuts her hand trying to open a can of food.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Natalia says, as her hand is covered in blood. \u201cMommy, please mommy. I don\u2019t know how to take care of this.\u201d",
      "She seeks help from a neighbor, who confuses her for a child, but Natalia tells her she's an adult who looks young.",
      "\u201cI remember reading the script and thinking, \u2018OK, this is going to be a big episode for me,\u201d Reid tells TODAY.com. \u201cIt was a little daunting because it\u2019s just me and long hours on set.\u201d",
      "The episode, Robbins tells TODAY.com, is the first time Natalia is seen on screen by herself.",
      "\u201cOne might not realize it watching the first four episodes, but in those first four episodes, you\u2019re never in a scene only with\u00a0Natalia. She can only be in a scene if she\u2019s in a scene with Kristine or Michael, because those episodes are from their perspective,\u201d Robbins says. \u201cSo by the time you get to (Episode) 5 and you\u2019re on the other side of that door, it\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve been in a room alone with her.\u201d",
      "As the episode continues, viewers see Natalia getting into trouble after she and the neighbor\u2019s grandson take the bus and get lost while attempting to go to the Barnetts\u2019 home.",
      "She is treated poorly by adoptive parents, who after the incident have to move her to a new apartment, which happens to be on the second floor and even smaller. The hardships continue for Natalia, who feels abandoned, yet attempts to \u201cstraighten up\u201d to earn her family\u2019s love.",
      "\u201cAll of a sudden you have to say, \u2018Oh my gosh, all these things that have come to believe about her, were they true, or were they not true?'\u201d",
      "Katie Robbins",
      "'\u201cAll of a sudden you have to say, \u2018Oh my gosh, all these things that have come to believe about her, were they true, or were they not true?'\u201d Robbins says. \u201cAnd that episode was incredibly emotional to write, and it was incredibly emotional to film.\u201d",
      "Robbins says that watching Reid film her solo scenes was incredibly emotional for everyone on set.",
      "\u201cWatching (Imogen) play those scenes, people on our crew, people who have been doing this job for decades and who have seen it all, seasoned pros, were crying watching her because of the vulnerability that she brings and because of the themes that it deals with,\u201d Robbins adds.",
      "Reid tells TODAY.com that the fifth episode does \u201csuch an amazing job\u201d of showing her character\u2019s point of view.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s just been abandoned, and she's not only 8 years old, but she has a disability, and it\u2019s just so heartbreaking to see her go through all of that,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd for her, to just get worse and worse as we go on, because (she) can\u2019t look after herself, Episode 5 is something that I\u2019m genuinely so proud of.\u201d",
      "Viewers will continue to see life from Natalia\u2019s perspective when Episode 6 of \u201cGood American Family\u201d premieres Wednesday, April 16."

      "A Russian ballistic missile strike killed at least 31 people and injured more than 80 others in the Ukrainian city of Sumy on Sunday, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, marking one of the deadliest single attacks on the country this year.",
      "The strike came amid rising tensions between Moscow and Kyiv, as both sides accuse each other of violating a tentative U.S.-brokered moratorium on attacks targeting energy infrastructure, while diplomatic efforts led by the U.S. have yielded few results.",
      "Zelenskyy condemned the latest attack, and accused Russia of \"taking the lives of ordinary people\" noting that the attack took place on Palm Sunday as people attended church services.",
      "\"Russian missiles hit an ordinary city street, ordinary life, residential buildings,\u201d he posted on X. \u201cOnly filthy scum can act like this.\"",
      "Handout footage released by the Ukranian government and verified by NBC News showed the moment one missile struck, igniting a blinding flash of light before a colossal plume of smoke emerges in the distance.",
      "In another video, an explosion rocks the camera as it shakily pans to a Sumy street suddenly shrouded in smoke. Vehicles were engulfed in flames, debris littered the streets, and panicked residents ran for cover or helped the injured, with at least one casualty sprawled across a sidewalk.",
      "The strikes coincided with ongoing diplomatic efforts by the U.S. that have notably excluded Ukraine",
      "On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin met with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff in St. Petersburg for four hours of closed-door talks. The meeting came after Donald Trump, on Truth Social, urged Witkoff to \u201cget moving\u201d on a ceasefire to end the \u201cterrible and senseless war.\u201d",
      "Neither Moscow nor Witkoff, who later traveled to Oman for talks with Iran, disclosed details of the meeting. Zelenskyy\u00a0has repeatedly insisted that his country should be involved in any talks regarding its future.",
      "The Sumy attack has cast further doubt on Russia\u2019s willingness to pursue a genuine resolution, while Zelenskyy called on Europe and the U.S. to \"respond firmly.\"",
      "\"Without pressure on Russia, peace is impossible,\" Zelenskyy added.",
      "But so far, efforts at diplomacy have fallen short.",
      "The two nations\u00a0used a high-level conference in Turkey on Saturday to once again trade accusations of violating a tentative\u00a0U.S.-brokered deal\u00a0to pause strikes on energy infrastructure, with the two foreign ministers speaking at separate events at the annual Antalya Diplomacy Forum.",
      "\u201cThe Ukrainians have been attacking us from the very beginning, every passing day, maybe with two or three exceptions,\u201d Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said, adding that Moscow would provide the U.S., Turkey and international bodies with a list of Kyiv\u2019s attacks during the past three weeks, and insisted Russia had stuck to the terms of the deal.",
      "His Ukrainian counterpart, Andrii Sybiha, contested that claim, saying Russia had launched \u201calmost 70 missiles, over 2,200  drones, and over 6,000 guided aerial bombs at Ukraine, mostly at civilians,\u201d since agreeing to the limited pause on strikes.",
      "\"This clearly shows to the world who wants peace and who wants war,\" he said.",
      "Russia currently holds about 20% of Ukraine's territory since it launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022."

    "summary": "Former MI6 chief Sir Richard Dearlove says that if President Donald Trump wants a Nobel Peace Prize he should hold off negotiating a Russia-Ukraine ceasefire.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 If President Donald Trump wants a Nobel Peace Prize, he should hold off negotiating a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia, Britain\u2019s former top spy told NBC News on Thursday.",
      "Richard Dearlove, the ex-head of British intelligence agency MI6, said that rushing a truce \u2014 and giving too many concessions to the Kremlin \u2014 could encourage President Vladimir Putin to launch other hostile forays into Europe.",
      "The Russians badly need a ceasefire, said Dearlove, citing waning Kremlin cash reserves and the falling price of crude oil, which Moscow exports to fund its war machine.",
      "\u201cUkraine is pretty close to a tipping point,\u201d he said in a wide-ranging interview. \u201cBut the worry at the moment is that Trump will do a premature deal with the Russians\u201d and make too many concessions.",
      "The \u201chighly undesirable\u201d consequences would be to \u201cembolden the Russians, over time, to be more aggressive and assertive in Europe,\u201d said Dearlove over a coffee at one of London\u2019s historic private members clubs.",
      "His remarks come as Ukraine\u2019s military chief said Russia had launched a new offensive in the Eastern European country.",
      "While often less critical of Trump\u2019s unorthodox approach than many other foreign policy experts, Dearlove said he finds Trump\u2019s general \u201clack of grace\u201d and \u201clack of decent behavior\u201d to be \u201cvery disconcerting\u201d \u2014 specifically his Oval Office bust-up with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in February.",
      "\u201cMy general view of Americans is they\u2019re gracious and they behave very respectfully,\u201d said a gently amused Dearlove, 80, an Olympic rower\u2019s son who spent a year at Connecticut\u2019s preparatory Kent School before gaining his degree back in Britain at the University of Cambridge. \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary the way that Trump has blown up all of that.\u201d",
      "The jovial, outspoken grandee of the British foreign policy establishment joined MI6 in 1966 and served as its chief \u2014 code-named \u201cC\u201d \u2014 between 1999 and 2004. He now co-hosts the \u201cOne Decision\u201d podcast, covering global news, alongside former U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta.",
      "He says he \u201cstrongly supports\u201d the American president\u2019s campaign to pressure European allies to spend more on defense, decrying the imbalance of Europe enjoying a relatively generous health care and benefits system while letting the U.S. foot the bill for Western defense.",
      "\u201cWhy should American taxpayers pay for indulgent social security programs in countries like Germany, France and Italy?\u201d he said.",
      "He dismisses \u201cSignalgate\u201d \u2014 in which Trump\u2019s team discussed bombing Yemen on the messaging app Signal \u2014 as a \u201cstupid\u201d and \u201csilly mistake\u201d that showed \u201ca degree of amateurism.\u201d And he said it wouldn\u2019t have a long-term impact on Western intelligence sharing.",
      "Reached for comment on Dearlove\u2019s remarks, White House principal deputy press secretary Harrison Fields said, \u201cPresident Trump is a master negotiator who has done more to bring about world peace during his tenure than any president in modern history.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe President\u2019s Peace Through Strength agenda has delivered historic achievements across the globe and restored American dominance on the world stage,\u201d Fields added. \u201cThe \u2018experts\u2019 have been wrong for decades, and doing the same thing while expecting a different result is the definition of insanity.\u201d",
      "The ex-MI6 head says his biggest short-term worry revolves around Trump\u2019s approach to Ukraine, which has involved parallel talks with both Kyiv and Moscow and has been lambasted by Trump\u2019s critics in the West as being too favorable to the latter.",
      "\u201cIf you want to get the Nobel Peace Prize, don\u2019t do a premature deal with Ukraine \u2014 wait,\u201d Dearlove said. (According to former aides, the president still covets the landmark award won by four of his predecessors, and for which Trump has been nominated at least twice before.)",
      "Dearlove believes the Russians are on the back foot and will only come under more pressure to accept terms. \u201cThe Russians themselves badly need a ceasefire, but Putin is incapable of seeking one because he \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a reverse gear,\u201d Dearlove said.",
      "On Iran, responding to Trump\u2019s announcement that the U.S. will hold direct talks with Tehran over its nuclear program, Dearlove says he believes the administration will \u201cdemand a very high price\u201d \u2014 namely that Iran give up its entire nuclear program, both for energy and weapons.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a bottom line for Trump and Israel that Iran must not have nuclear capability,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty clear that if Iran were to try to weaponize or if the intelligence suggests that they are weaponized, then there would be a joint Israeli-American attack.\u201d",
      "Trump didn\u2019t rule out military action if the talks don\u2019t succeed, saying Tehran would have a \u201cvery bad day\u201d if diplomacy failed.",
      "Dearlove agreed: \u201cIf the Iranians don\u2019t negotiate, or if they mislead, which they\u2019re quite capable of doing, they\u2019re ones heading for a crisis.\u201d",
      "Dearlove was head of MI6 when the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003, and was later criticized by a public inquiry for his handling of intelligence alleging that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, a key argument steering Britain into the war alongside Washington. At the inquiry in 2017, he described claims he was too close to the British government as \u201ccomplete rubbish.\u201d And, according to a BBC interview in 2023, he is among a minority of people who believe that Iraq did have some kind of weapons program, but that its components may have been moved into neighboring Syria.",
      "Looking ahead, Dearlove believes by far the biggest issue is how the West deals with China.",
      "\u201cPax Americana\u201d \u2014 the \u201cAmerican peace\u201d that has largely held since 1945 and is a byword for Washington\u2019s postwar global dominance \u2014 has \u201cdefinitively disintegrated,\u201d he said. In its stead, there has to be \u201csome sort of understanding between the United States and China,\u201d whose President Xi Jinping \u201cwants to create a world by 2050 which is aligned with China\u2019s value system,\u201d he added.",
      "\u201cChina and the West are intimately intertwined: You can\u2019t take them apart, you can\u2019t disentangle them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, it\u2019s totally opposed to the Western value system.\u201d",
      "He characterizes Xi\u2019s Chinese Communist Party as \u201ctalking about global domination\u201d \u2014 something vehemently rejected by Beijing.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s going to have to be some sort of international agreement which accommodates what I would describe as the two spheres of influence,\u201d he said. Otherwise, China is \u201cgoing to end up in a confrontation with the United States at some point in the 21st century.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Iran and the U.S. met on Saturday and have agreed to resume talks on nuclear issues and sanctions next week, the White House said.",
      "In a statement released after the talks concluded earlier in the day, the White House described the discussions as \"positive and constructive,\" a sentiment echoed by Iran's foreign ministry.",
      "The stakes for the talks could not be higher, as they represent a rare instance of interaction between the two nations after decades of tension.",
      "U.S Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi had a brief exchange in the presence of Oman's foreign minister at the end of Saturday's talks, the Associated Press reported, citing Iranian state TV.",
      "\u201cBoth sides made serious efforts to show their willingness for a fair and suitable agreement,\u201d Araghchi said, adding that the next round of talks will be in one week.",
      "Israel, which views Iran as an existential threat, and the U.S. see Iran as a rogue regime intent on pursuing weapons of mass destruction that will stop at little to undermine its opponents.",
      "Iran\u2018s leadership, meanwhile, faces a choice between giving up its nuclear aspirations, which would most likely render it more vulnerable in the long run, or continuing along the path of nuclear development and dramatically raise the risk of an attack from Israel and the U.S.",
      "While Iran has always denied that it wants to develop nuclear weapons, top officials have repeatedly said that if it is attacked, this will change and eventually push it toward building a nuclear bomb.",
      "President Donald Trump revealed the negotiations in a surprise announcement Monday while standing alongside the leader of Iran's arch enemy, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
      "While Trump touted the discussions as \"direct\" talks with Tehran,  Araghchi quickly countered by saying the negotiations would be indirect, at least for now.",
      "The White House has not responded to questions about the discrepancy.",
      "On Saturday Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei wrote on the social platform X that the \u201cindirect talks\u201d had begun.",
      "Indirect talks would likely function as a \u201cstarting point and a communication\u00a0bridge\u201d to help both sides understand each other\u2019s positions, according to Aniseh Bassiri Tabrizi, an associate fellow at Chatham House\u2019s Middle East and North Africa program.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s probably going to be more maximalist than any follow-up conversation that they might have,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to remember there has not been any direct engagement between the U.S. and Iran for awhile.\u201d",
      "Tough talk",
      "The American team is taking a tough stance as it goes into talks this weekend, with the U.S. issuing fresh sanctions Wednesday.",
      "Hanging over discussions in the Gulf kingdom of Oman will be Trump\u2018s threat that if the talks fail to yield results, \u201cIran is going to be in great danger.\u201d Trump has threatened to bomb Iran if it refuses to strike a deal on the future of its nuclear program.",
      "The bid to end Iran's nuclear program is one that Trump has resumed from his first term, when he pulled the U.S. out of the landmark 2015 Iranian nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Under the JCPOA, Iran agreed to dismantle much of its nuclear program and allow inspections of its facilities in exchange for sanctions relief.",
      "Trump withdrew from the JCPOA because, he said, it was a \"horrible one-sided deal\" that did not address Tehran's ballistic missile program nor its network of proxies throughout the region. The U.S. move infuriated the Iranian government after it had adhered to the terms the agreement signed with the Obama administration and five other world powers.",
      "Saturday's talks also come after repeated warnings from Rafael Grossi, the head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, that Iran was \u201cdramatically\u201d accelerating its enrichment of uranium up to 60% purity, inching closer to the around 90% level that constitutes weapons grade.",
      "In an op-ed in The Washington Post, Araghchi\u00a0maintained there was no evidence Tehran had violated its commitment not to seek nuclear weapons. It was \u201cwilling to clarify our peaceful intent and take the necessary measures to allay any possible concern.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the conflict in the Gaza Strip that has consumed the Middle East for the past year and a half has seen two of Iran\u2019s key nonstate allies in what\u2019s known as its axis of resistance, Hamas and Hezbollah, severely weakened by Israeli forces, with Washington increasingly taking aim at the Houthis in Yemen.",
      "'Very high price'",
      "Richard Dearlove, former head of the  British intelligence agency MI6, told NBC News in an interview Thursday he believed the Trump administration would \u201cdemand a very high price\u201d \u2014 that Iran give up its entire nuclear program, both for energy and weapons.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a bottom line for Trump and Israel that Iran must not have nuclear capability,\u201d he said.",
      "Seyed Hossein Mousavian, a Middle East security and nuclear policy specialist at Princeton University and a former spokesman for Iran in its nuclear negotiations with the West, said he did not believe that if talks this weekend failed to produce such a result that the immediate \"alternative would be war.\"",
      "Trump, for his part, has offered little reassurance, warning Monday: \u201cIf the talks aren\u2019t successful, I think it\u2019s going to be a very bad day for Iran.\"",
      "\u201cIran definitely is in a different situation from where it was, say, back in 2016 or even 2023,\u201d Tabrizi said, noting that \u201ca lot has happened over the past year and a half\u201d alone, with the weakening of Tehran\u2019s proxies.",
      "Mousavian agreed, saying both sides will be using the indirect talks as an opportunity to \u201cassess each other and the intentions of the other side.\u201d",
      "But time is of the essence. With Iran\u2019s proxies severely weakened and its air defenses damaged in tit-for-tat clashes with Israel last year, Israel and Republican hawks in Washington believe the moment is ripe for military action against Iran\u2019s nuclear sites."

      "The letter comes as Israel has ramped up its offensive in Gaza, trying to increase pressure on Hamas to return the 59 hostages still being held. More than half are presumed dead. Israel has imposed\u00a0a blockade\u00a0on food, fuel and humanitarian aid that has left civilians facing acute shortages as supplies dwindle.

      "Still, the reference to \u201czones\u201d is likely to have raised alarms in Kyiv, reinforcing fears that U.S. negotiations might acknowledge Russia\u2019s de facto control of occupied Ukrainian territory.",
      "Ukraine has repeatedly rejected any ceasefire or peace deal involving the ceding of land. Meanwhile Russia\u2019s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in March that the Kremlin would not accept peacekeeping troops from any NATO country \u201cunder any condition.\u201d",

      "\u201cHe [the pilot] called in that he was landing and that he needed fuel, and it should have taken him about three minutes to arrive, but 20 minutes later, he didn\u2019t arrive,\u201d Roth told the paper, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re all devastated.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump called the crash \"terrible\" in a Truth Social Post Thursday night. \"God bless the families and friends of the victims,\"\u00a0he said.",
      "NBC Aviation analyst Jeff Guzzetti said\u00a0on NBC's \"TODAY\" show Friday: \"There was some sort of sudden in flight failure that occurred to the point where the pilot didn\u2019t have an opportunity to make a forced landing or a mayday call, so something happened abruptly.\"",
      "He noted weather doesn't appear to be a factor, although there were some gusts and winds in the area.",
      "\"We\u2019re looking at some sort of hardware issue that perhaps could have been prompted by an inappropriate pilot response, which could have been prompted by something like a bird strike. We just don't know yet,\" he said. Guzzetti noted the incident has the marks of mast bumping \u2014 when the rotor hub strikes the main rotor mast \u2014  but the wreckage needs to be looked at to be sure.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board investigation will look into the pilot, the wreckage of the chopper, and whether the passengers had any footage on board, and will determine if there were any birds or strong winds in the area at the time of the crash, Guzzetti said."

      "SANTO DOMINGO \u2014\u00a0Identifying and conducting autopsies for the 225 people killed in the Jet Set nightclub's roof collapse four days ago has been a task so daunting it overwhelmed the country's morgue.",
      "Heartbroken families hoping to receive the remains of their loved ones have been waiting outside the Dominican Republic's institute of pathology for days, begging authorities to release the bodies so they can start to mourn their relatives.",
      "R\u00f3ger de la Rosa, who flew from the United States after finding out on Wednesday that his sister, Rosie de la Rosa Ortega, was one of the fatal victims, was desperately demanding answers from forensic officials on Friday morning. He questioned the need for the autopsies.",
      "\u201cNo one has faced me,\u201d de la Rosa said in Spanish. \u201cNo one has the courage to look me in the eyes.\u201d",
      "Others like Ana Julia Mej\u00eda, who was waiting to receive her mother\u2019s remains, had the same question.",
      "\"We don't want an autopsy because we know what they died of. We just want them to give them to us, so we can hold a wake,\" Mej\u00eda told Noticias Telemundo.",
      "Public Health Minister Victor Atallah updated the death toll from 221 to 225 when speaking to Noticias Telemundo early Friday afternoon.",
      "Government officials have said the autopsies help determine if the person died instantly, as a result of their injuries or by asphyxia due to the debris. Also, they said, the autopsies will likely serve as \"important evidence\" in the ongoing investigation into what caused the collapse.",
      "As of late Thursday night, forensic officials had completed 130 autopsies, according to the national attorney general\u2019s office.",
      "Antoliano Peralta, a legal consultant to the Dominican Republic\u2019s executive branch, admitted in an interview with Noticias Telemundo that the tragedy's death toll was so big it \"exceeds the forensic institute's capacity.\"",

      "The attorney general\u2019s office said in a statement the government has \"strengthened our forensic medical team with the goal of completing all autopsies\" by Friday.",
      "Of the autopsies conducted as of Friday morning, over 80% of the victims died of head trauma caused by the impact of the crumbling ceiling, Atallah said. \"That means that they either died instantly or very quickly.\"",
      "\u2018I was trapped in the rubble\u2019",
      "In addition to the hundreds of bodies, rescue crews recovered 189 survivors from the rubble. Cristobal Moya was among those who survived.",
      "Speaking to NBC News from his hospital bed Thursday afternoon, Moya said he survived \"thanks to God.\"",
      "He recalled sitting down to watch renowned merengue singer Rubby P\u00e9rez perform on stage when what appeared to be heavy dust began to fall from above.",
      "\"In a minute, the roof caved in. Something hit my head. I lost consciousness,\" Moya said in Spanish. \"When I woke up, I was trapped in the rubble.\" He thought for a second, \"Was I dreaming? No, I wasn\u2019t.\"",
      "Video from the people who rescued Moya shows him laying face down, his head covered in blood and his body buried in the debris. Moya sustained injuries in his head, torso and legs.",
      "\"God gave me an opportunity,\" Moya said. \"A new opportunity at life.\"",
      "Videos from inside the Jet Set nightclub minutes before disaster struck show what is now P\u00e9rez's last concert. Before the roof collapse killed him, P\u00e9rez was entertaining the crowd with his powerful voice and energetic dance moves.",
      "The videos were filmed by Isaac Gonz\u00e1lez, the nightclub\u2019s official photographer. He was there to capture what was supposed to be a celebratory event starring one of the biggest music stars of the Dominican Republic. But instead, he ended the night documenting one of the country\u2019s deadliest events.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez said the roof collapsed when he stepped outside the venue for five minutes to take a break. He was one of the first to film the club's devastation and the emergency response. His videos also show first responders arriving at the scene, later placing body bag after body bag into ambulances.",
      "Funeral services and burials\u00a0for all the victims continue to take place this week.",
